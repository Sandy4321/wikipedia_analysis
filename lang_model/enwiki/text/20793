'''Macrinus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus Augustus}};<ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Macrinus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS OPELLIVS SEVERVS MACRINVS AVGVSTVS.</ref> ca. 165 <U+2013> June 218), was [[Roman Emperor]] from 217 to 218. Macrinus was of [[Berber people|Berber]] (Indigenous people of North Africa) descent and as a member of the [[Equestrian order|equestrian class]] he became the first emperor who did not hail from the [[Roman Senate|senatorial class]].<ref>"Macrinus, by race a Moor, from Caesarea... one of his ears had been bored in accordance with the custom followed by most of the Moors", [[Cassius Dio]], ''Dio's Rome (bk 79)'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, v.6, p.21</ref>

Macrinus was overthrown and executed in 218.

==Background and career==
Born in Caesarea (modern [[Cherchell]], Algeria) in the [[Roman province]] of [[Mauretania]] to an [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family, Macrinus received an education which allowed him to ascend to the Roman political class. Over the years he earned a reputation as a skilled lawyer, and under the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] he became an important bureaucrat. Severus' successor [[Caracalla]] appointed him [[Praetorian prefect|prefect]] of the [[Praetorian Guard]].

While Macrinus probably enjoyed the trust of Caracalla, this may have changed when, according to tradition, it was prophesied that he would depose and succeed the Emperor, and rumors spread regarding his alleged desire to take the throne for himself. Given Caracalla's tendency towards murdering political opponents, Macrinus probably feared for his own safety should the Emperor become aware of this prophecy. According to Dio, Caracalla had already taken the step of re-assigning members of Macrinus' staff.

In the spring of 217, Caracalla was in the eastern provinces preparing a campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Macrinus was among his staff, as were other members of the Praetorian Guard. In April, the Emperor went to visit a temple of [[Selene|Luna]] near the spot of the [[battle of Carrhae]], accompanied only by his personal bodyguard, which included Macrinus. Events are not clear, but it is certain that Caracalla was murdered at some point on the trip (perhaps on April 8).

Caracalla's body was brought back from the temple by his bodyguards, along with the corpse of a fellow bodyguard. The story as told by Macrinus was that the dead guard had killed Caracalla. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor, and also nominated his son [[Diadumenianus]] ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and successor; he conferred upon him the name "Antoninus", thus connecting him with the relatively stable reigns of the [[Nerva<U+2013>Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Antonine emperors]] in the 2nd century.

==Reign (April 217 <U+2013> June 218)==
Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was confirmed in his new role by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. According to S.N. Miller, this may have been due to both his background as an accomplished jurist and his deferential treatment of the senatorial class. He found it necessary, however, to replace several provincial governors with men of his own choosing. Caracalla's mother [[Julia Domna]] was initially left in peace, but when she started to conspire with the military he ordered her to leave [[Antioch]]. Being at that time in an advanced stage of breast cancer (Cassius Dio) she chose instead to starve herself to death.

In urgent matters of foreign policy, Macrinus displayed a tendency towards conciliation and a reluctance to engage in military conflict. He averted trouble in the province of [[Dacia]] by returning hostages that had been held by Caracalla, and he ended troubles in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] by granting that country's throne to [[Tiridates II of Armenia|Tiridates]], whose father had also been imprisoned under Caracalla. Less easily managed was the problem of [[Mesopotamia]], which had been invaded by the [[Parthia]]ns in the wake of Caracalla's demise. Meeting the Parthians in battle during the summer of 217, Macrinus achieved a [[Battle of Nisibis (217)|costly draw]] near the town of [[Nisibis]] and as a result was forced to enter negotiations through which Rome was obliged to pay the enormous [[indemnity]] of 200 million sesterces to the Parthian ruler [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Artabanus IV]] in return for peace.

Macrinus displayed some financial farsightedness when he revalued the [[Roman currency]]. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 51.5% to 58% <U+2014> the actual silver weight increasing from 1.66&nbsp;grams to 1.82&nbsp;grams.<ref>[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University "Roman Currency of the Principate"]</ref>

Macrinus' reluctance to engage in warfare, and his failure to gain victory over even a historically inferior enemy such as the Parthians caused considerable resentment among the soldiers. This was compounded by him curtailing the privileges they had enjoyed under Caracalla and the introduction of a pay system by which recruits received less than veterans. After only a short while, the legions were searching for a rival emperor.

At a high point of his popularity monuments were built to honour Macrinus, including the grand [[tetrastyle]] [[Capitoline Temple]], in [[Volubilis]] was erected in 217 AD.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, edited by A. Burnham]</ref>

His popularity also suffered in Rome. Not only had the new emperor failed to visit the city after taking power but a late-summer thunderstorm caused widespread fires and flooding. Macrinus' appointee as urban prefect proved unable to repair the damage to the satisfaction of the populace and had to be replaced.

==Downfall==
[[File:Aureus Macrinus-RIC 0079.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[aureus]] of Macrinus. Its elaborate symbolism celebrates the ''[[liberalitas]]'' ("prodigality") of Macrinus and his son [[Diadumenian]].]]
This discontent was fostered by the surviving members of the [[Severan dynasty]], headed by [[Julia Maesa]] (Caracalla's aunt) and her daughters [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Julia Mamaea]]. Having been evicted from the imperial palace and ordered to return home by Macrinus, the Severan women plotted from their home near [[Emesa]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] to place another Severan on the imperial throne. 

They used their hereditary influence over the cult of [[solar deity|sun-deity]] Elagabalus (the Latinised form of [[El-Gabal]]) to proclaim Soaemias' son [[Elagabalus]] (named for his family's patron deity) as the true successor to Caracalla. The rumor was spread, with the assistance of the Severan women, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's illegitimate son and thus the child of a union between first cousins.

=== Execution (218) ===
On May 18, Elagabalus was proclaimed emperor by the [[Legio III Gallica|Legio III ''Gallica'']] at its camp at [[Raphana]]. A force under his tutor Gannys marched on [[Antioch]] and engaged a force under Macrinus on June 8 218. Macrinus, deserted by most of his soldiers, was soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|battle]] and fled towards Italy disguised as a courier{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. He was captured near [[Chalcedon]] and later executed in [[Cappadocia]]. His son [[Diadumenian]], sent for safety to the Parthian court, was captured at [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] and also murdered{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}.

Macrinus' short reign, while important for its historical "firsts", was cut short due to the inability of this otherwise accomplished man to control or satisfy the soldiery{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. In his death at the hands of Roman soldiers, Macrinus reinforced the notion of the soldiers as the true brokers of power in the third-century empire and highlighted the importance of maintaining the support of this vital faction{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. His reign was followed by another seventeen years of rule under the Severan emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Severus Alexander]].
