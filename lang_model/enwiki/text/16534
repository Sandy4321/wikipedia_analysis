'''Steven Holl''' (born [[December 9]], [[1947]], [[Bremerton, Washington]]) is an American academic [[architect]] best known for the 1998 [[Kiasma Contemporary Art Museum]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]] and the controversial 2003 Simmons Hall at [[MIT]], [[Boston]], [[USA]].  

Holl graduated from the [[University of Washington]] in 1971, established his offices in [[New York City]] in 1976, and has taught at [[Columbia University]] since 1981.  

In 1998 Holl was awarded the pretigious [[Alvar Aalto]] Medal. In 2000, Holl was elected to [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. Holl was named as "America's Best Architect" by [[Time Magazine]] in 2001. 

Holl's architecture has undergone a shift in emphasis, from his earlier concern with [[typology]] to his current concern with a [[phenomenological]] approach; that is, with a concern for man's [[existentialist]], bodily engagement with his surroundings. The shift came about partly due to his interest in the writings of philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and architect-theorist [[Juhani Pallasmaa]].
