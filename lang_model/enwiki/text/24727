{{infobox ununseptium}}
'''Ununseptium''' is the temporary name of a [[superheavy element|superheavy]] [[synthetic elements|artificial]] [[chemical element]] with temporary symbol '''Uus''' and [[atomic number]] 117. The element, also known as '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[astatine]]''' or simply '''element 117''', is the second heaviest element of all created. Its discovery was first announced in 2010, when the element was claimed to have been created in [[Dubna]] by a joint Russian<U+2013>American collaboration.<ref name=E117>[http://www.jinr.ru/img_sections/PAC/NP/31/PAK_NP_31_recom_eng.pdf Recommendations: 31st meeting, PAC for Nuclear Physics]</ref> Another experiment in 2011 created one of its [[daughter isotope|daughters]] using a different method, partially proving the results of the discovery experiment, and the original experiment was repeated successfully in 2012. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), however, has made no comment on whether or not the element can be recognized as discovered.

In the [[periodic table]] ununseptium is located in the group 17, all previous members of which are [[halogens]]. The element is unlikely to be a halogen, however, and will probably show differences, although a few key properties such melting and boiling points and first ionization are expected to follow the [[periodic trends]]. While lighter isotopes are agreed in the literature to be very unstable, there are signs that the super-heavy isotopes may be much more stable.

==History==
===Pre-discovery===
In 2004 the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) team in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia developed a project for the discovery of element 117 (with 117 [[proton]]s in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]) that required smashing together a [[berkelium]] (element 97) target and a [[calcium]] (element 20) beam.<ref name="elements">{{cite web|title=Synthesis of a new element with atomic number Z=117|year=2010|author=Gabage, Bill|publisher=webelements.com|url=http://www.webelements.com/nexus/chemistry/synthesis-new-element-atomic-number-z117}}</ref> Citing a lack of production of the exotic material, however, the world's only producer of berkelium, the team at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the United States, refused to provide any.<ref name="elements"/> Plans to synthesize element 117 were shelved temporarily in favor of the synthesis of [[ununoctium|element 118]], which was produced by smashing another target (made of [[californium]]) with calcium in a Russian<U+2013>American collaboration.<ref name="pp2002">{{cite journal|author=Oganessian, Yu.

===Discovery===
[[File:DecayChain Ununseptium.svg|thumb|left|300px|Decay chain of the ununseptium isotopes produced. The black figures are experimentally obtained while the blue ones are theoretically predicted.<ref name="117s"/>]]
The experiment began in June 2009 and, in January 2010, scientists at the [[Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions]] announced internally that they had succeeded in detecting the [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of a new element with [[atomic number|Z]] = 117 via two decay chains of an odd-odd isotope (undergoing 6 alpha decays before undergoing a [[spontaneous fission]]) and of an odd-even one (3 alpha decays before fission).<ref name=E117/> On April 9, 2010 an official report was released in the journal ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''. It revealed that the isotopes mentioned in the previous chains referred to <sup>294</sup>Uus and <sup>293</sup>Uus, formed as follows:<ref name="117s"/>

:{{Nuclide|Berkelium|249}} + {{Nuclide|calcium|48}}  <U+2192> {{Nuclide|Uus|297}}* <U+2192> {{Nuclide|Uus|294}}  + 3 {{su|b=0|p=1}}{{SubatomicParticle|neutron}} (1 event)

==Naming==
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], ununseptium should be known as ''eka-astatine'' or ''dvi-[[iodine]]''. In 1979 IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''ununseptium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uus''),<ref name=iupac>{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl.

The recommendations are largely ignored among scientists, who call it "element 117," with the symbol of ''(117)'' or even simply ''117''.<ref name="Folden">{{cite web |url=http://cyclotron.tamu.edu/smp/The%20Heaviest%20Elements%20in%20the%20Universe.pdf |title=The Heaviest Elements in the Universe |author=Folden, Cody |date=2009-01-31 |work=Saturday Morning Physics at Texas A&M |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> No official name has yet been suggested for the element. According to current guidelines from IUPAC, the ultimate name for all new elements should end in "-ium", which means the name for ununseptium may end in -ium, not -ine, even if ununseptium turns out to be a [[halogen]], which traditionally have names ending in "-ine".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200274050787|url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7405x0787.pdf|title=Naming of new elements (IUPAC Recommendations 2002)|year=2002|author=Koppenol, W.

The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after [[plutonium]], the heaviest [[primordial element]], so that all isotopes with an atomic number above [[mendelevium|101]] [[radioactive decay|decay radioactively]] with a [[half-life]] under a day, with an exception of [[dubnium]]-268.

===Predicted atomic, physical, and chemical properties===
Ununseptium is a member of group 17 in the [[periodic table]], below the five [[halogen]]s. The previous members of the group commonly accept another electron to achieve an stable [[noble gas|noble-gas]] [[electronic configuration]], which is the minimum-energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bader|first=Richard F.W|url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/|title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> A neutral halogen atom, however, lacks the extra electron, having a valence electron configuration of ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>5</sup>; in ununseptium's case, the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s<sup>2</sup>7p<sup>5</sup>.<ref name="Haire"/> Certain chemical properties, however, are predicted to differ from what one would expect based on [[periodic trend]]s from the lighter [[halogen]]s because of [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].

In its free form the element is thought to form [[diatomic molecule]]s, just like the other halogens. Since the sigma bonding shows a great antibonding character in the At<sub>2</sub> molecule, ununseptium is predicted to continue the trend and a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Uus<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="Haire"/><ref name="POL"/> The resulting molecule could become the heaviest molecule composed of a single element at standard conditions. The melting point of ununseptium is predicted to be 350<U+2013>500&nbsp;<U+00B0>C<ref name="Haire"/> and the boiling point should be about 550&nbsp;<U+00B0>C,<ref name="Haire"/> exceeding the astatine (and all preceding) values, following periodic trends, which means that the element should be a solid in its free form. The first [[ionization energy]] (7.7&nbsp;eV) is lower than that of the previous halogens, again following the trend.<ref name="Haire"/> 

Achieving the [[octet rule|octet]] configuration by forming a negative oxidation state, however, becomes less common going down the group, with astatine already forming a positive oxidation state in its [[astatine hydride|hydride]]. This trend continues for ununseptium: the <U+2212>1 state is predicted to be the least stable of the predicted four, with +5, +3, and especially +1 being more stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electrons. The +5 state is predicted to also be uncommon, as the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons are (oppositely) stabilized. The +3 state may resemble that of Au<sup>3+</sup> in ion-exchange behavior in a [[halide]] environment.<ref name="Haire"/>

Similar to Uus<sub>2</sub>, the molecule UusCl should be bonded via a single pi bond.<ref name="POL"/> The molecule UusF should be the most tightly bound of all [[interhalogen]] monofluorides.<ref name="POL">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=QbDEC3oL7uAC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=Re+trend+HI+HAt+H117&source=bl&ots=S4hksKcjBK&sig=bFbp0ra8N1qSHFVR_p-m2MV65hI&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=OsftT8G3IcSq-Abi2IS3Dg&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=117&f=false|pages=84, 504|title=Relativisic Methods for Chemists|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|author=Leszczynski, J.|isbn=9781402099748|doi=10.1007/9781402099755|year=2010}}</ref> The halogen hydrides show an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy; the molecule UusH is thought to continue the trend.<ref name="Haire"/> The molecule UusF<sub>3</sub> should not have the T-shaped geometry seen in other interhalogen trifluorides.<ref name="POL"/> In the molecule [[ununtrium|Uut]]Uus, the more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] atom is notably predicted to be the ununtrium atom, the opposite of what periodic trends would predict.<ref name="POL"/>
