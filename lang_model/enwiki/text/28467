'''"Bart the Mother"''' is the third episode of the 10th season of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', originally airing on September 27, 1998. The episode was written by [[David X. Cohen]] and directed by [[Steven Dean Moore]]. It was the last full-length episode Cohen wrote for ''The Simpsons'' before leaving to work on ''[[Futurama]]''. The original idea for the episode was intended to be a [[B story]], but because it was too difficult to work into other episodes, it eventually became a primary plot. "Bart the Mother" contains the final appearance of the character [[Troy McClure]], and it is dedicated to his voice actor [[Phil Hartman]], who was murdered by his wife four months before the episode aired.<ref name="finalep">{{cite news|title=Tributes To A Star And His Voices|accessdate=2008-10-24|date=1998-09-23|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|author=Virginia Rohan|page=Y8}}</ref> In the episode, [[Bart Simpson]] accidentally kills a mother bird with a [[BB gun]], and decides to hatch and take care of the two eggs he found in the bird's nest.

In its original American broadcast, "Bart the Mother" finished 58th in ratings for the week of September 21<U+2013>27, 1998, with a [[Nielsen Rating]] of 7.4, translating to 7,355,600 households. [[Nancy Cartwright]], the voice actor who portrayed Bart, described the episode as one of her favorites. Several reviewers, who called the tenth season of ''The Simpsons'' one of the series' less humorous seasons, chose "Bart the Mother" as one of its better episodes. Bart's moral dilemma and soul searching moments near the end of the episode was praised by some as a refreshing turn of events for the series, and a number of reviewers also called "Bart the Mother" a memorable episode.

==Plot==
When [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes the family to the Family Fun Center, she notices [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] acting like a bully, especially when he knocks [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] off the track and wins a [[BB gun]] from prize tickets. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and Nelson attempt to be friends, but Marge forbids Bart to hang out with Nelson. Bart goes to Nelson<U+2019>s house anyway and starts using Nelson's new BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills the bird. Marge is furious that Bart killed an animal, but instead of punishing him, she refuses to have anything to do with his destructive ways. After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two eggs in a bird's nest. Since he does not want the babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and secretly keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect that he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him that she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, who Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.<ref name=episode>{{cite episode |title=Bart the Mother |series=The Simpsons |airdate=September 27, 1998 }}</ref>

Bart and Marge take the lizards to the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] Birdwatching Society. [[Principal Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], a member of the society, explains that they are [[Bolivia|Bolivian]] tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird<U+2019>s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to decimate pigeons in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Since the town considered the pigeons to be a nuisance, they are delighted with the fact that the lizards have eaten all the pigeons. As a result, Bart is thanked and honored by [[Mayor Quimby]] with a [[loganberry]] scented candle. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] worries that the town will now become infested by lizards rather than the pigeons, but Skinner assures her that they will send in Chinese snakes, then gorillas, and then "winter will take care of the rest."<ref name=episode />

==Production==
[[File:Davidcohen.jpg|thumb|left|"Bart the Mother" was the last full-length episode [[David X. Cohen]] wrote for ''The Simpsons'' before he left to work on ''[[Futurama]]''.]]

"Bart the Mother" was the last full-length episode [[David X. Cohen]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. Shortly after the episode aired, Cohen teamed up with ''The Simpsons''{{'}} creator [[Matt Groening]] to develop ''[[Futurama]]'', where he served as [[executive producer]] and [[head writer]] for the series' entire run. Cohen's idea for the episode started out as a [[B story]] for Homer. In the original concept, pigeons nest outside Homer's window at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. [[Mr Burns]] exterminates the pigeons and Homer climbs out onto the ledge of the window, in the middle of a blizzard, to nest the eggs. Cohen said the idea "[did not] fit in anywhere," so he decided to pitch it as an A story instead, with Bart nesting the eggs instead of Homer. ''The Simpsons'' writer [[George Meyer]] thought the idea of Bart shooting the bird and simply nesting the eggs was too straightforward, and he did not think it had "enough of a twist" to be a good episode. Cohen and Meyer eventually decided that the eggs should be lizard eggs. Cohen thought that the twist was what ultimately made the episode both "touching" and "interesting."<ref name=Cohen>{{cite video | people=Cohen, David S. |year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Bart the Mother"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Producer [[Ron Hauge]] came up with the idea of someone shooting a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was "far, far away."<ref name=Hauge>{{cite video | people=Hauge, Ron |year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Bart the Mother"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was "dying inside."<ref name=Hauge/> For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from the ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' episode "Opie the Birdman." The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so that when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet would hit the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court comprised of a [[vulture]], an [[eagle]], and a [[toucan]] as judges. This sequence was added to "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the [[742 Evergreen Terrace|Simpsons' house]].<ref name=Cohen/> Then-[[show runner]] [[Mike Scully]] had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] called "[[Marge Be Not Proud]]." In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer [[Bill Oakley]] suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.<ref name=Scully>{{cite video | people=Scully, Mike|year=2007|title=The Simpsons The Complete Tenth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Bart the Mother"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

[[File:Flygdrake ugglan.gif|thumb|The gliding lizard genus [[Draco (genus)|Draco]], seen here, served as inspiration for the Bolivian Tree Lizard in the episode.]]

The Family Fun Center that the Simpson family visits is based on a real [[family fun center]] in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]] that Cohen went to as a child to play video games. The Bolivian Tree Lizard is a fake species, but Cohen based it on real animals, including the [[dinosaur]] species [[Oviraptor]], which was originally thought to eat eggs. The species is also based on the [[cowbird]] and the [[cuckoo]], which lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and [[Draco (genus)|Draco]], a genus of gliding lizards. Cohen also received inspiration from the [[Cane Toad]] that started "taking over" Australia in 1935.<ref name=Cohen/>

"Bart the Mother" marked the last guest appearance of [[Phil Hartman]] on ''The Simpsons'' as [[Troy McClure]]. On May 28, 1998, four months before the episode aired, he was murdered by his wife Brynn.<ref name="finalep">{{cite news|title=Tributes To A Star And His Voices|accessdate=2008-10-24|date=1998-09-23|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|author=Virginia Rohan|page=Y8}}</ref> "Bart the Mother" was dedicated in Hartman's memory in response to this.<ref name="finalep"/> Rather than replace Hartman with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure from the show, along with Hartman's other recurring character, [[Lionel Hutz]].<ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4249835| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-29| accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref>
