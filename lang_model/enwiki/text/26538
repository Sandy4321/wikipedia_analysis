'''Isaac''' or '''Yitzchak''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''<U+05D9><U+05B4><U+05E6><U+05B0><U+05D7><U+05B8><U+05E7>''', <small>[[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Standard]]</small> ''{{Unicode|Yi<U+1E93><U+1E25>aq}}'' <small>[[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]</small> ''{{Unicode|Yi<U+1E63><U+1E25><U+0101>q}}'' ; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''<U+0625><U+0633><U+062D><U+0670><U+0642>''', ''{{Unicode|<U+02BE>Is<U+1E25><U+0101>q}}'' ; "he will laugh") is the son of [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]], and the father of [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] as described in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. His story is told in the [[Book of Genesis]]. Isaac was the longest-lived of the patriarchs, and the only [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarch]] whose name was not changed. Isaac was the only patriarch who did not leave [[Canaan]], although he once tried to leave and God told him not to do so. Compared to other patriarchs in the Bible, his story is less colorful, relating few incidents of his life. 

The New Testament contains few references to Isaac. The [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]] viewed Abraham's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac as an example of faith and obedience.

Isaac is a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] in [[Islam]]. A few narratives of Isaac appear in the [[Qur'an]]. The Qur'an views Isaac as a righteous man, [[servant of God]] and the father of Jews. The Qur'an states that Isaac and his progeny are blessed as long as they uphold their covenant with God. Some early Muslims believed that Isaac was the son who was supposed to be sacrificed by [[Abraham]].<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> 

Some academic scholars have described Isaac as "a legendary figure" while others view him "as a figure representing tribal history, though as a historical individual" or "as a seminomadic leader, or as the founder of a cult."<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/>

==Etymology and meaning==
The English name Isaac is a translation of the Hebrew term ''{{Unicode|Yi<U+1E63><U+1E25><U+0101>q}}'' which literally means "laughter." The term conforms to a well-known Northwest [[Semitic]] linguist type, but is not known from elsewhere.<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> The [[Ugaritic]] texts from [[13th century|thirteenth century]] BCE refer to the benovolent smile of the [[Canaanite]] god [[El (god)|El]];<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> the [[Bible]] (i.e. the canonical collections of sacred writings of [[Judaism]]), however, ascribes the laugher to be Isaac's mother ([[Sarah]]) rather than the [[Canaanite]] god [[El (god)|El]].<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> The reason for Sarah's laughing, according to the Bible, was that God gave the news of the birth of Isaac to his parents. Since they were beyond the age of having children, they privately laughed at the prediction.<ref name="Britannica-Sarah"/><ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/>

==Hebrew Bible== 
Isaac is mentioned by name more than 70 times in the book of Genesis but only mentioned 33 times elsewhere. The phrase "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" occurs 23 times in the Hebrew Bible.<ref name="Dic"> Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, ''Isaac'', p.647 </ref> Chapters 17-28 of the book of Genesis contain the stories of Isaac. [[Historian]]s and [[academic]]s in the fields of [[linguistic]]s and [[source criticism]] believe that the stories of Isaac largely belong to the J, or Yahwist source (See [[Documentary hypothesis]]). The beginnings of {{niv|Genesis|17:15-27|Genesis 17:15-27}} and the end from {{niv|Genesis|27:46|Genesis 27:46}} to {{niv|Genesis|28:9|Genesis 28:9}} is however believed to belong to the P, or [[Priestly source]] while {{niv|Genesis|21:1-7|Genesis 21:1-7}} and {{niv|Genesis|22:1-19|Genesis 22:1-19}} is considered to be the E, or Elohist source.<ref name="EoC-Isaac"> Encyclopedia of Christianity(Ed. John Bowden), ''Isaac'' </ref> 

;The account of the life of Isaac according to the Hebrew Bible
God gave the news of the birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah. Sarah was beyond the age of having children and privately laughed at the prediction.<ref name="Britannica-Sarah"> Britannica Encyclopedia, ''Sarah'' </ref><ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> When the child was born, she said "God had made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me".<ref> Genesis 21:6 </ref> Isaac was the only child that Abraham and Sarah had together.<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> Sarah saw [[Ishmael]] mocking Isaac and urged her husband to banish [[Hagar]] and her child so that Isaac would be the only heir of Abraham.<ref name="New EoJ"/> Abraham was hesitant but at God's order he listened to his wife's request.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/> 

Abraham [[Brit milah|circumcised]] his son Isaac when the boy was eight days old.<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> According to the book of Genesis, a great feast was held for his being weaned.<ref name="Easton"/>

[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|left|The angel hinders the offering up of Isaac, by Rembrandt]]

Several years later, God tested Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice his son.<ref name="Jewish-Encyclopedia"> [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], ''Isaac'' </ref> Abraham obeyed and took Isaac to the mount [[Moriah]].<ref name="Catholic"> [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], ''Isaac'' </ref> Without murmuring, Isaac let Abraham bind him and lay him upon the altar as a sacrifice. Abraham took the knife and raised his hand to kill his son. At the last minute, an angel of the Lord prevented him from doing so. Instead of Isaac, Abraham sacrificed a ram that was trapped in a thicket nearby.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/> 

When Isaac was forty years of age, Abraham sent [[Eliezer]], his steward, into Mesopotamia to find a wife for him, from [[Bethuel]], his brother-in-law's family. [[Rebekah]] was sent and became the wife of Isaac. She was barren, so Isaac prayed for her and God granted her the favour of conception. She gave birth to twin boys, [[Esau]] and [[Jacob]].<ref name="New EoJ"> The New Encyclopedia of Judaism, ''Isaac'' </ref> Isaac favoured Esau, and Rebekah Jacob.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/> 

Some years afterward, a famine obligated Isaac to move to [[Gerar]], where [[Abimelech]] was king; and, as his father had done under similar circumstances, he referred to Rebekah as his sister. Abimelech, having discovered that she was his wife, reproved him for the deception.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/> 

As Isaac grew very rich and his flocks multiplied, the [[Philistines]] of Gerar became so envious that they filled up all the wells which Isaac's servants had dug. At the desire of Abimelech he departed and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar where he dug new wells, but was again put to some difficulties. At length, he returned to [[Beersheba]] where he fixed his habitation. Here the Lord appeared to him, and renewed the promise of blessing him. Also Abimelech visited him to form an alliance.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"/> 

Isaac grew very old (137 years) and became completely blind. He called Esau, his eldest son, and directed him to procure some venison for him. But while Esau was hunting, Jacob deceptively misrepresented himself as Esau to his blind father and obtained his father's blessing, making Jacob Isaac's primary heir, and leaving Esau in an inferior position. Isaac lived some time after this, and sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his own family.<ref name="JewishEncyclopedia"> Jewish Encyclopedia , [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=174&letter=I ''Isaac''] </ref>

==Jewish traditions==
In rabbinical tradition the age of Isaac at the time of binding is taken to be 37 which contrasts with common portrayals of Isaac as a child.<ref name="New EoJ"/> The [[Rabbi]]s also taught that the reason for the death of [[Sarah]] was the news of intended [[sacrifice]] of Isaac.<ref name="New EoJ"/> The sacrifice of Isaac was cited in appeals for the [[Atonement|mercy of God]] in the later [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions.<ref name="Britannica-Isaac"> Britannica Encyclopedia, ''Isaac'' </ref> The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and largely focus on Abraham's intended [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice of Isaac]], called the ''aqedah''("binding").<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived.<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/> According to many accounts of [[Aggadah]], unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac and not God.<ref name="Brill's New Pauly"> Brock, Sebastian P., Brill's New Pauly, ''Isaac'' </ref> Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred [[martyrdom]] to violation of the [[Halakha|Jewish law]].<ref name="New EoJ"/> 

According to the Jewish tradition Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on {{niv|Genesis|24:63|Genesis 24:63}} ("Isaac went out to mediate in the field at the eventide")<ref name="New EoJ"/>

Isaac was the only [[patriarch]] who stayed in [[Canaan]] during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so({{niv|Genesis|26:2|Genesis 26:2}}). Rabinnic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the [[Land of Israel]].<ref name="New EoJ"/> Isaac is the longest-lived of the patriarchs, and the only biblical patriarch whose name was not changed.<ref name="EoR-Isaac"/><ref name="Easton"> M.G. Easton, Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 3rd ed., ''Isaac'' </ref>

[[Rabbinic literature]] also linked Isaac's blindness in old age as stated in the Bible to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.<ref name="Brill's New Pauly"/>

==New Testament ==
The [[New Testament]] contains few references to Isaac.<ref> {{niv|Mathew|8:11|Mathew 8:11}}; {{niv|Luke|12:28|Luke 12:28}};{{niv|Luke|20:37|Luke 20:37}}; {{niv|Romans|9:7|Romans 9:7}}; {{niv|Galatians|4:28|Galatians 4:28}}; {{niv|Hebrews|11:17|Hebrews 11:17}}; {{niv|James|2:21|James 2:21}} cf. Catholic Encyclopedia </ref> There are references to Isaac having been "offered up" by his father, and to his blessing his sons.<ref name="Easton"/> Paul contrasted Isaac (symbolizing Christianity) with the rejected older son Ishmael (symbolizing Judaism); (see Galatians 4:21-30<ref>{{niv|Galatians|4:21-30|Galatians 4:21-30}}</ref>).<ref name="EoR-Isaac"> Encyclopedia of Religion, ''Isaac'' </ref>In [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 4:28-31,<ref>{{niv|Galatians|4:28-31|Galatians 4:28-31}}</ref> [[Hagar]] is associated with the [[Sinai]] covenant, while [[Sarah]] is associated with the covenant of grace (into which her son Isaac enters). James 2:21-24<ref>{{niv|James|2:21-24|James 2:21-24}}</ref> argues that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification requires both faith and works.<ref name="EoC-Isaac"/> 

In the early [[Christian]] [[church]], [[Abraham]]'s willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac was used as an example of faith (Hebrews 11:17<ref>{{niv|Hebrews|11:17|Hebrews 11:17}}</ref>) and of obedience (James 2:21<ref>{{niv|James|2:21|James 2:21}}</ref>).<ref name="Britannica-Isaac"/> While the epistle to the Hebrews<ref>{{niv|Hebrews|2:19|2:19}}</ref> views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of sacrifice of Jesus on the [[cross]] dates back to the end of first [[The Christian Century|Christian century]]. It first appeared in the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[epistle of Barnabas]] and later became an important theme for many renowned artists.<ref> Browning (1996), p.187 </ref>

==Islam==
Isaac is a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] in [[Islam]], mentioned in 15 [[Qur'an]]ic passages.<ref> Appraisals for Isaac: {{cite quran|6|84|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|12|6|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|19|50|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|21|72|end=73|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|37|113|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|38|45|end=47|style=ref}} - Isaac prophecy: {{cite quran|2|133|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|136|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|140|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|84|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|163|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|6|84|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|12|6|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|19|49|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|21|73|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|37|112|style=ref}}</ref><ref name="EoI_Ishaq"> ''Ishaq'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]] </ref> Like many other [[Hebrew]] prophets, the Qur'anic references to Isaac assume the audience is already familiar with him and his stories. There is little narrative of Isaac in the Qur'an.<ref> ''Isaac'', Encyclopedia of the Qur'an</ref> 

The Qur'an recalls that Isaac was given to [[Sarah]], when she and her husband [[Abraham]] were both old.<ref>see {{cite quran|11|70|end=74|style=ref}}</ref><ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> God gave Abraham the [[good news]] of the birth of Isaac "a prophet, one of the Righteous,"<ref> see {{cite quran|37|112|style=ref}}</ref> via messengers sent against the people of [[Lut]]. Sarah, however, is said to have laughed at the [[Glad Tidings|glad tidings]] of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> 

Several other verses of the Qur'an talking about Isaac and Jacob being given to Abraham,<ref>({{cite quran|6|84|style=ref}}; {{cite quran|19|49|end=50|style=ref}}; {{cite quran|21|72|style=ref}})</ref> and that God <U+201C>made prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring<U+201D>.<ref>(see also {{cite quran|38|45|style=ref}} and {{cite quran|29|27|end=26|style=ref}})</ref><ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> The formula "We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob" has been "thought by some scholars to demonstrate that in the early revelations [[Jacob]] was considered to be a son of Abraham and not his grandson."<ref name="EoI_Jacob"> ''Jacob'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]] </ref> In some instances, the Qur'an  joins together Isaac and [[Ishmael]] and "Abraham praises God for giving him the two although he was old."<ref>{{cite quran|14|39|end=41|style=ref}}</ref> In other instances Isaac's names occurs in the lists <ref>(see {{cite quran|12|38|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|127|end=133|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|161|end=163|style=ref}})</ref><ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> Isaac is also mentioned alongside the twelve ''asbat'' (meaning tribes), who were the descendants of Isaac from Jacob.<ref name = Wheeler>{{Citation

The [[Qur'an]] states that Abraham was commanded to sacrifice his son. The son is not however named in the Qur'an <ref>(see {{cite quran|37|99|end=113|style=ref}})</ref> and in early [[Islam]], there was a dispute over the identity of the son. However, Muslim scholars came to endorse that it was [[Ishmael]].<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> The argument of those early scholars who believed in Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably Ibn <U+1E32>utayba, and al-<U+1E6C>abar<U+012B>) was that "God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac (in {{cite quran|12|6|style=ref}}) referred to his making Abraham his friend and saving him from the burning bush and to his rescuing Isaac. The other party held that the promise to Sarah of son Isaac and grandson [[Jacob]] <ref>({{cite quran|11|71|end=74|style=ref}})</ref> excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac.<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> The early dispute was more concerned with [[Persian people|Persian]] rather than [[Jewish]] rivalry with [[Arab]]s, since the Persians claimed to be of descendants of Isaac. [[Ali al-Masudi|Al-Masudi]] for example reports a Persian poet (902 CE) who claimed superiority over Arabs through descent from Isaac.<ref name="EoI_Ishaq"/> However, Al-Masudi may have misunderstood the ancestry of the Persians which belonged to the Indo-European branch called Aryan while Abraham was clearly a Semite.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Academic view ==
Some scholars have described Isaac as "a [[legendary]] figure" while others view him "as a figure representing [[tribal]] history, though as a [[historical]] individual" or "as a semi[[nomadic]] leader, or as the founder of a [[cult]]."<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"> The Eerdmans, The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Isaac, p.744 </ref>

The stories of Isaac, like other patriarchal stories of Genesis, are generally believed in western scholarship to have "their origin in folk memories and oral traditions of the early [[Hebrew]] pastoralist experience."<ref name="EoCol-Isaac"> [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], ''Isaac''</ref> ''The Cambridge Companion to the Bible'' makes the following comment on the Biblical stories of the patriarchs:

<blockquote>Yet for all that these stories maintain a distance between their world and that of their time of literary growth and composition, they reflect the political realities of the later periods. Many of the narratives deal with the relationship between the ancestors and peoples who were part of Israel<U+2019>s political world at the time the stories began to be written down (eight century B.C.E.). Lot is the ancestor of the Transjordanian peoples of Ammon and Moab, and Ishmael personifies the nomadic peoples known to have inhibited north Arabia, although located in the Old Testament in the Negev. Esau personifies Edom (36:1), and Laban represents the Aramean states to Israel<U+2019>s north. A persistent theme is that of difference between the ancestors and the indigenous Canaanites<U+2026> In fact, the theme of the differences between Judah and Israel, as personified by the ancestors, and the neighboring peoples of the time of the monarchy is pressed effectively into theological service to articulate
 the choosing by God of Judah and Israel to bring blessing to all peoples.<U+201D> <ref> The Cambridge Companion to the Bible, p.59</ref></blockquote>

According to [[Martin Noth]], a renowned scholar of the Hebrew Bible, the narratives of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage than that of the West-Jordanian [[Jacob]].<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/> At that era, the [[Israelite]] tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern [[Palestine]] with the inhabitants of the settled countryside.<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/> The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the North and in support of this theory adduces [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/>

Distinguished biblical historians Albrecht Alt and [[Martin Noth]] hold that "The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the [[Pentateuch]] tradition."<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/> According to [[Martin Noth]], at the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the [[Pentateuch]] tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs, however his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham.<ref name="EoC1-Isaac"/>

==Testament==
{{main|Testament of Isaac}}
The Testament of Isaac is a [[pseudonymous]] text which was most likely composed in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Egypt]] after 100 C.E. It is also dependent on the [[Testament of Abraham]]. In this testament, God sends the angel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] to Isaac in order to inform him of his impending [[death]]. Isaac accepts God's decree but [[Jacob]] resists. Isaac in his bed-chamber tells Jacob of the inevitability of death. Isaac has a tour to [[heaven]] and [[hell]] shortly before his death in which God's compassion to repentant sinners is emphasized. In this testament, Isaac also talks with the crowds on the subjects of [[priesthood]], [[asceticism]], and the [[moral]] life.<ref name="Dic"/>

==Isaac in art ==
The earliest Christian portrayal of Isaac is found in the Roman catacomb frescoes.<ref name="Early Christian Art"> The Iconography of the Sacrifice of Isaac in Early [[Christian art|Christian Art]], by Alison Moore Smith, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 26, No. 2, 159-173 </ref>
Excluding the fragments, Alison Moore Smith classifies these artistic works in three categories: 

<blockquote>"paintings showing the approach to the Sacrifice in which Abraham leads Isaac, bearing faggots, towards the altar; or Isaac approaches with the bundle of sticks, Abraham having preceded him to the place of offering...[paintings in which] Abraham is upon a pedestal and Isaac stands near at hand, both figures in orant attitude...[paintings in which] Abraham is shown about to sacrifice Isaac while the latter stands or kneels on the ground beside the altar. Sometimes Abraham grasps Isaac by the hair. Occasionally the ram is added to the scene and in the later paintings [[Hand of God|the Hand of God]] emerges from above"<ref name="Early Christian Art"/> </blockquote>
