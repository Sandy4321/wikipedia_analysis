'''David Thorpe''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[motocross]] racer and a three-time [[List of motocross World Championship results|World Champion]].<ref name=mxlarge>{{cite web|url=http://www.mxlarge.com/detail.php?classtodisplay=homepage&idtodisplay=810|title=MXlarge interview - Dave Thorpe|accessdate=28 August 2007|last=Meyer|first=Geoff |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070915043126/http://www.mxlarge.com/detail.php?classtodisplay=homepage&idtodisplay=810 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 September 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bestsports.com.br/db/atlpag.php?atl=8322&lang=2 David Thorpe career profile]</ref>

Thorpe's early career saw him excel in both [[motocross]] and [[Association football|football]], and at one stage he was even offered a contract with professional side [[Queen's Park Rangers]], before opting to concentrate on motocross. After a successful early career for the UK [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] team, Thorpe switched to the [[Honda]] factory racing team in [[1983]]. He emeged as a regular Grand Prix winner in 1984, and took his first world title in 1985. In this year's [[Motocross des Nations]] at Gaildorf in Germany he also took the overall individual win beating American riders [[Jeff Ward (motocross)|Jeff Ward]] and [[David Bailey (motocross)|David Bailey]]. He retained his world title in 1986, following a season long battle with Honda team-mate [[Andr<U+00E9> Malherbe]].

A series of injuries prevented Thorpe from making a title challenge in 1987 and 1988, where he finished fifth and third respectively in the 500cc [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] World Championship. However, Thorpe won his third title in 1989, following a thrilling season-long battle with [[Eric Geboers]]. 1990 saw him move teams to the factory Kawasaki team, however the Kawasaki machine was inferior to the factory Honda, and Thorpe struggled to compete. In 1990 and 1991 he finished fifth and seventh respectively in the 500cc World Championship. Thorpe left Kawasaki in 1991, and moved back to Honda, riding for the Italian 'Cinti Honda' team. Thorpe was unable to capture his old form, and he retired from professional motocross in 1993 at the age of 31.

== Post-Motocross career ==

After a spell as manager of the Great Britain motocross team in the [[Motocross des Nations]], (which included a famous Great Britain victory in 1994), Thorpe concentrated on team management, running the UK based [[CAT Honda]] team during the late 1990s. The team was a success both in the UK and on the Grand Prix circuit, however Honda suddenly withdrew their support (along with several other teams) in 2001, and the team disbanded.

In recent years, Thorpe has returned to motocross, although he now competes for fun, competing in his local regional championship with great success. He has also been clerk of the course of the West of England MCC's Patchquick trophy meeting.

In 2007 Thorpe contested the two round, FIM Veterans Motocross World Cup in the senior class. Thorpe won the overall victory at both rounds ([[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Belgium]] and [[Donington Park]], [[Great Britain]]), giving him his fourth world title.<ref name=mxlarge/><ref name=youthstream>{{cite web|url=http://www.motocrossmx1.com/default.aspx?cs=6&type=news&id=1801|title=FOX FIM Motocross Grand Prix of Great Britain-Last Info|accessdate=28 August 2007|publisher=Youthstream}}</ref>
