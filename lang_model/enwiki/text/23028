'''Kerang''' is a rural town ({{coor dm|35|43|S|143|55|E|region:AU-VIC_type:city(4400)}}) on the [[Loddon River]] in northern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]]. It is the commercial centre to an irrigation district based on dairying, horticulture, lucerne and grain.  It is located {{km to mi|279|precision=0|spell=UK|wiki=yes}} north-west of [[Melbourne]] on the [[Murray Valley Highway]] a few kilometres north of its intersection with the [[Loddon Valley Highway]], elevation {{m to ft|78|precision=0|spell=UK|wiki=yes}}. At the 2006 [[Census in Australia|census]], Kerang had a population of 3780.

Kerang's symbol is a flying [[ibis]].  The area around Kerang is dotted with lagoons and lakes and is believed to have the most populous ibis rookeries in the world with an estimated 200,000 ibis using the area for breeding each year, along with many other waterbirds.  It is also a popular recreational destination.

==History==
The [[Wemba-Wemba]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigines]] are thought to have been the area's first occupants. [[Thomas Mitchell]] was the first European to visit the area, in [[1836]]. [[Squatters]] began to settle in the area in [[1845]] and in [[1848]] [[Richard Beyes]] opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In [[1857]] [[Woodford Patchell]] built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become Kerang. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use [[irrigation]] and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane.

Kerang was declared a shire in [[1871]]; at the time the settlement's population was 109. The arrival of the railway from [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] in [[1884]] and the construction of a [[Kerang-Koondrook Tramway|tramway to Koondrook]] in [[1888]] led to expansion; by [[1891]] the population had increased to over a thousand.  The spread of Patchell's irrigation ideas improved local productivity and the town continued to expand.

==Burke and Wills==
{{main|Burke and Wills expedition}}
The [[Burke and Wills]] expedition passed through Kerang on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. On Sunday, 2 September [[1860]] the expedition camped at Booth & Holloway's Tragowell Station to the south of Kerang. On Tuesday, 4 September [[1860]] they passed through Kerang, crossed the Loddon and camped at Mr Fenton's Reedy Creek Run, making Camp XIII, (their thirteenth camp since leaving Melbourne).

==Transport==
Kerang is located at the junction of the [[Loddon Valley Highway|Loddon Valley]] and [[Murray Valley Highway]]s. Air transport is provided by [[Kerang Airport]]. 

The town is also on the [[Swan Hill railway line, Victoria|Swan Hill railway line]], served by [[V/Line]] trains from [[Kerang railway station, Victoria|Kerang station]] to [[Melbourne]], as well as coach services to [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]]. The [[Kerang-Koondrook Tramway]] once linked the town to [[Koondrook, Victoria|Koondrook]] from 1889, being closed to passengers in 1976,<ref name="nrs">{{cite journal
