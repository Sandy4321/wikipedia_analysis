"'''Eight Days a Week'''" is a song written by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], based on Paul's original idea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/dba04sale.html |title=Beatles Songwriting & Recording Database: Beatles For Sale |publisher=Beatlesinterviews.org |date=4 December 1964 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> recorded by [[The Beatles]] and released on their December 1964 album ''[[Beatles for Sale]]''.

==Inspiration==
The inspiration of the song has been attributed to at least two different sources by Paul McCartney. In a 1984 interview with Playboy, he credited the title to [[Ringo Starr]], who was noted for his [[malapropisms]], which are credited as the source of other song titles (such as "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]] and [[Tomorrow Never Knows]]).{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|1984}}

{{bquote|LINDA: Ringo also said, 'Eight days a week.'<p>PAUL: Yeah, he said it as though he were an overworked chauffeur. (in 
heavy accent) 'Eight days a week.' (laughter) When we heard it, we said, 'Really? Bing! Got it!'|Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney|1984 Playboy Interview{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|1984}}}}

However, he has also credited the title to an ''actual'' chauffeur who once drove him to Lennon's house in Weybridge.

{{bquote|I usually drove myself there, but the chauffeur drove me out that day and I said, 'How've you been?' <U+2013> 'Oh working hard,' he said, 'working eight days a week.'|Paul McCartney|The Beatles Anthology{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=159}}}}

==Recording==
"Eight Days a Week" is the first song which The Beatles took into the studio unfinished to work on the arrangement during the session, which would later become common.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=49}} The song was mainly recorded in two recording sessions on 6 October devoted exclusively to this song, which lasted nearly seven hours with a fifteen-minute break in between.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=49}} Lennon and McCartney tried several ideas for the intro and outro of the song. The first take featured a simple acoustic guitar introduction. The second take introduced an "oo"-ing vocal that was experimented with until the sixth take, when it was abandoned in favour of the final guitar intro.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=49}} The final outro (along with unused intro takes) was recorded separately on 18 October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=49}} The final version of the song incorporated another Beatles' first and pop music rarity: the song begins with a [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade-in]], as opposed to the common fade-out ending. The instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, drums, bass and overdubbed handclaps. The fade-in and [[coda (music)|coda]] both include more guitar overdubs.

==Release and acclaim==
The song, along with two others from the album ("Baby's in Black" and "No Reply"), was planned as a single release. In the end, it was released as a single only in the United States on 15 February 1965, becoming a number-one hit (their seventh).{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 29, track 2}} Its B-side was "[[I Don't Want to Spoil the Party]]". The single release in the US was the result of [[DJ]]s playing the song from imported copies of the ''Beatles for Sale'' album as an exclusive since it was not included on the album's US counterpart ''[[Beatles '65]]''. Later, it made a US album appearance on ''[[Beatles VI]]''.

Although it was a huge American hit, the group did not think highly of the song (Lennon called it "lousy"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=174}}) and they never performed it live.
