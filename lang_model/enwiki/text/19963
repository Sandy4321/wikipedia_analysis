'''Henry Taube,''' [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] , [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] , [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] , [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (November 30, 1915 &ndash; November 16, 2005) was a [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[chemist]] noted for having been awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for "his work in the mechanisms of electron-transfer reactions, especially in metal complexes."<ref name=nobelpr>{{cite web|title=Press Release:  The 1983 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1983/press.html|publisher=NobelPrize.org The Official Website of the Nobel Prize|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>  He was the first Canadian-born chemist to win the Nobel Prize.  Taube completed his undergraduate and [[Master of Science|Masters]] degrees at the [[University of Saskatchewan]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  After finishing graduate school, Taube worked at [[Cornell University]], the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Stanford University]]. 

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Taube also received many other major scientific awards, including the [[Priestley Medal]] in 1985 and two [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s early in his career (1949 and 1955), as well as numerous honorary doctorates.  His research focused on [[redox reaction]]s, transition metals and the use of [[isotope|isotopically labeled]] compounds to follow reactions.  He had over 600 publications including one book, and had mentored over 200 students during his career.  Taube and his wife Mary had three children, his son [[Karl Taube|Karl]] is an [[anthropologist]] at the [[University of California Riverside]].

==Education==
At 12, Taube left his hometown and moved to Regina to attend [[Luther College (Saskatchewan)|Luther College]] where he completed high school.<ref name=esask />  After graduating, Taube stayed at Luther College and worked as laboratory assistant for Paul Liefeld, allowing him to take first year university classes.<ref name=esask />  Taube attended the [[University of Saskatchewan]], receiving his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] in 1935 and his [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] in 1937.<ref name=esask />  His thesis advisor at the University of Saskatchewan was [[John Spinks]].<ref name=jce />  While at the University of Saskatchewan, Taube studied with [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who would be awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  He moved to [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] studies in 1940.<ref name=esask />  His Ph.D mentor was William Bray.<ref name=jce />  Taube's graduate research focused on the [[photodecomposition]] of chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide in solution.<ref name=jce>{{cite web|title=A Century of Chemical Dynamics Traced Through the Nobel Prizes:  Henry Taube 1983|url=http://academics.smcvt.edu/chemistry/FACULTY/jvh_publications/1983_Taube.pdf|work=Journal of Chemical Education|last=Van Houten|first=J.|date=2002-07|accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref>

==Research and academic career==
===Academic posts===
After completing his education, Taube remained in the United States, becoming an instructor in chemistry at Berkeley until 1941.  He initially wanted to return to Canada to work, but did not receive a response when he applied for jobs at the major Canadian universities.<ref name=wosd>{{cite book|title=World of Scientific Discovery, 2nd Edition|editor1-first=Kimberley A. |editor1-last=McGrath |editor2-first=Bridget |year=1999 |editor2-last=Travers |publisher=Gale Research|location=Detroit|isbn=0-7876-2760-7|pages=921<U+2013>922}}</ref> From Berkeley, he served as an instructor and assistant professor at [[Cornell University]] until 1946.  During [[World War II]], Taube served on the [[National Defense Research Committee]].<ref name=biography>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Henry-Taube-9502618|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref>  Taube spent time at the [[University of Chicago]] as an assistant professor, associate professor and as a full professor from 1946<U+2013>61.  He served as chair of the chemistry department in Chicago from 1956<U+2013>59, but did not enjoy administrative work.<ref name=wosd />  After leaving Chicago, Taube worked as a professor at [[Stanford University]] until 1986, a position that allowed him to focus on research,<ref name=wosd /> while also teaching classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels.<ref name=stanfordmem />  He became a [[Professor Emeritus]] at Stanford in 1986,<ref name=nobelcv>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube - Curriculum Vitae|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1983/taube-cv.html|publisher=Nobel Web|accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref> but he continued to perform research until 2001,<ref name=ichem>{{cite journal |last1= Creutz|first1=Carol |last2=Ford |first2=Peter C. |last3=Meyer |first3=Thomas J. |year=2006 |title=Henry Taube:  Inorganic Chemist Extraordinaire |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=45 |pages=7059<U+2013>7068}}</ref> and visited his labs every day until his death in 2005.<ref name=cen />  In addition to his academic duties, Taube also served as a consultant at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] from 1956 until the 1970s.<ref name=osti>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube and Coordination Chemistry|url=http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/taube.html|publisher=United States Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information|accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref><ref name=nmr>{{cite web|title=Early History of NMR at Los Alamos|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/17/035/17035984.pdf|date=1985-11|accessdate=2011-03-25|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|format=pdf|pages=3, 7|last=Jackson|first=Jasper A.}}</ref>

===Research interests===
Taube's initial research at [[Cornell University]] focused on the same areas he studied as a graduate student, oxidizing agents containing [[oxygen]] and [[halogens]], and [[redox reaction]]s  featuring these species.  He used [[isotope|isotopically labeled]] oxygen-18 and [[radioactive]] chlorine to study these reactions.  He was recognized by the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1955 for his isotope studies.<ref name=chapter>{{Cite doi|10.1021/ba-1997-0253.pr001}}</ref>

Taube's interest in [[coordination chemistry]] was sparked when he was chosen to develop a course on advanced [[inorganic chemistry]] while at the University of Chicago.  He was unable to find much information in the textbooks available at the time.  Taube realized that his work on the substitution of carbon in organic reactions could be related to inorganic complexes.<ref name=wosd />  In 1952, Taube published a key paper relating the rates of chemical reactions to electronic structure in ''[[Chemical Reviews]].''<ref name=wosd /><ref name=stanfordmem>{{cite web|title=Memorial Resolution:  Henry Taube|url=http://facultysenate.stanford.edu/memorial_resolutions/Taube_Henry_SenD5801.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Stanford University Senate|accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref><ref name=cr>{{cite journal |last1=Taube |first1=Henry|year=1952 |title=Rates and Mechanisms of Substitution in Inorganic Complexes in Solution |journal= Chemical Reviews|publisher= |volume=50|pages=69<U+2013>126}}</ref>  This research was the first to recognize the correlation between the rate of [[ligand]] substitution and the ''d''-[[electron configuration]] of the metal.<ref name=jce />  Taube's key discovery was the way molecules build a type of "chemical bridge" rather than simply exchanging electrons, as previously thought.  Identifying this intermediate step explained why reactions between similar metals and ions occurred at different rates.  His paper in ''Chemical Reviews'' was developed while on [[sabbatical]] in the late 1940s.<ref name=ford />  An article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' called this paper "one of the true classics in inorganic chemistry" after his [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] was announced.<ref name=science>{{cite journal|title=The 1983 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|last1=Gray|first1=Harry B.|last2=Collman|first2=James P.|journal=Science|volume=222|number=4627|date=1983-12-02|pages=986<U+2013>987}}</ref>  Taube researched [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]], both elements have a high capacity for [[back bonding]].  This type of [[electron]] donation was key when studying the way electrons are transferred between molecules in a chemical reaction.<ref name=wosd />

When looking back on his research, Taube explained that he sometimes had difficulty finding graduate students willing to work on electron transfer reactions, as they preferred to work on more "exciting" projects in his laboratory focusing on the effects of [[isotope|isotopic]] tracers and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].<ref name=jce />  Taube felt that a "primary flaw" with his correlation between electron configuration and ligand substitution was that it was described mainly in terms of [[valence bond theory]], as [[crystal field theory]] and [[ligand field theory]] were not well established when he published his work in 1952.<ref name=jce />

===Awards and honors===
====Nobel Prize====
Taube was awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his work on the mechanisms of electron transfer reactions, especially in metal complexes."<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry Henry Taube 1983|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1983/|publisher=Nobel Web|accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref>  He received his award on December 8, 1983, with the presentation speech being delivered by Ingvar  Lindqvist of the [[Royal Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=nobelspeech>{{cite web|title=Award Ceremony Speech|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1983/presentation-speech.html|accessdate=2010-09-22|publisher=Nobel Web}}</ref>  Taube's Nobel Lecture was entitled "Electron Transfer between Metal Complexes - Retrospective."<ref name=nobellecture>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube - Nobel Lecture|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1983/taube-lecture.html|publisher=Nobel Web|accessdate=2010-09-22}}</ref>  His Nobel Prize was the first awarded to a Canadian-born chemist.<ref name=jce />  Taube's win was the first for an inorganic chemist since 1913 ([[Alfred Werner]]),<ref name=jce /> breaking a long string of awards to [[organic chemistry|organic chemists]].<ref name=wosd />  His initial paper in ''Chemical Reviews'' was 30 years old at the time of his Nobel Prize victory, but the correlation he described between the rate of [[ligand]] substitution and [[electronic configuration]] for [[transition metal]] coordination complexes was still the predominant theory about the reaction chemistry of these compounds.<ref name=science />  After being awarded the Nobel Prize, Taube noticed a side benefit to the prestigious award - his students paid better attention in class.<ref name=students>{{cite web|title=Nobel laureate Henry Taube|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/october3/taube-103.html|publisher=Stanford Report|date-2001-10-03|accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref>

Colleagues remember Taube as a dedicated scientist, Jim Collman of Stanford said "Henry was a scientist's scientist and a dominant figure in the field of inorganic chemistry."<ref name=lectureseries />  Harry Gray, a professor at [[California Institute of Technology]] said, "He was in a class by himself, a role model and leader whom we all admired and loved."<ref name=cen>{{cite web|title=Nobelist Henry Taube Dead at 89|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/83/i47/8347Taube.html|work=Chemical and Engineering News|date=2005-11-18|accessdate=2011-03-24|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth K.}}</ref>  Former student Peter Ford remembers that Taube "made chemistry not only challenging and stimulating, but a lot of fun as well."<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube -- Nobel in chemistry|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-11-19/bay-area/17400718_1_riverside-heinrich-taube-chemistry-henry-taube|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2005-11-19|accessdate=2011-03-24|last=Rubenstein|first=Steve}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Taube was born November 30, 1915 in [[Neudorf, Saskatchewan|Neudorf]], [[Saskatchewan]] as the youngest of four boys.<ref name=esask>{{cite web|title=Taube, Henry (1915-2005)|url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/taube_henry_1915-.html|publisher=University of Regina|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>  His parents had immigrated to Saskatchewan from the Ukraine in 1911.<ref name=esask />  Growing up, his first language was [[Low German]].<ref name=ford>{{cite journal|title=Celebration of inorganic lives:  interview with Henry Taube|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews| volume=249| year=2005| start page=275| endpage=279| last1=Ford| first1=Peter C.| doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2004.09.010}}</ref>  In the 1700s, [[Catherine the Great]] encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia.  As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants.<ref name=esaskimm>{{cite web|title=German Settlements|url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/german_settlements.html|accessdate=2011-04-02|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan}}</ref> Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting:  "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken in the context of those times that I would wish to be changed.  The advantages that I enjoyed include:  the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught me also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..."<ref name=jce />  After completing his graduate studies, Taube became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1942.<ref name=jce />  Taube married his wife, Mary in 1952.  They had three children, [[Karl Taube|Karl]], Heinrich and Linda.  His stepdaughter, Marianna died of cancer in 1998.  When he stopped his active research projects in 2001, Taube continued to be available as a reviewer and consultant, but his main goal was "enjoying life".<ref name=students />  Away from chemistry, Taube had varied interests including gardening and classical music, mainly opera.<ref name=stanfordmem />  Henry Taube died in his home in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]] on November 16, 2005, at the age of 89.<ref name=stanfordobit>{{cite web|title=Henry Taube, recipient of Nobel Prize in Chemistry, dead at 89|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/november30/taube-113005.html|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=2005-11-17|accessdate=2010-09-22|last=Shwartz|first=Mark}}</ref>
