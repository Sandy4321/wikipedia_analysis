'''Pierre Cad<U+00E9>ac''' (fl. 1538 <U+2013> 1558) was a French composer and probably singer of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], active in [[Gascony]].  He wrote both sacred and secular vocal music, and had his music published in [[Paris]] and [[Lyon, France|Lyons]].  His most famous work was the [[chanson]] ''Je suis desh<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>e'', which many later composers, including [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], used as a basis for [[parody mass]]es.

==Life==

He was most likely from the small town of [[Cad<U+00E9>ac]], in the southern part of Gascony near the [[Pyrenees]], as suggested by his name.  All that is known about his life is that he was choirmaster in [[Auch]], the historical capital of the region, in 1556, as mentioned on the title page of Du Chemin's publication of his ''Missa Alma Redemptoris Mater''.  A poem by [[Bernard du Poey]], published in 1551, also mentions him as being resident in Auch, but does not give his employment or any other details.<ref name="Bernstein, Grove online">Bernstein, Grove online</ref> In 1538 [[Jacques Moderne]] published some of his chansons in Lyons; this is the earliest date of activity known for Cad<U+00E9>ac, but his location or employment at that time are not known.

==Music and influence==

Cad<U+00E9>ac wrote music in most of the vocal forms of the time and place, including secular [[chanson]]s, [[motet]]s, [[mass (music)|mass]] settings, [[Magnificat]]s, and one isolated setting of the [[Credo]] (part of the mass).  A total of 11 chansons, 24 motets, eight settings of the mass, and four of the Magnificat survive.  His chansons seem to be his earliest work, and he turned to sacred music later in his career.  Pierre Attaingnant (in Paris) and Jacques Moderne (in Lyons) published most of his chansons between 1538 and 1541.  One of them became extraordinarily famous: ''Je suis desh<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>e'' was widely distributed, and composers as diverse as [[Jean Maillard]] in France, [[Nicolas Gombert]] in the [[Habsburg]] chapel and the Low Countries, [[Orlande de Lassus]] in Bavaria, and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] in Italy all used it as source material for masses later in the century.<ref name="Bernstein, Grove online"/><ref>Nugent, Grove online</ref>

The distribution of his motets was also extraordinary, with copies found in places as remote from their Gascon origin as [[Madrid]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Venice]], and [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], Poland.  A version of his chanson ''Je suis desh<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>e'' has been found in England, fitted with English words ("Oure Father God Celestiall").<ref name="Bernstein, Grove online"/>  (The original is not so reverent:  "I'm broke.  Go tell my friend" is the gist of the opening stanza.)  

Cad<U+00E9>ac's musical style originated from the [[homophony]] and simplicity prevalent in the 1530s, especially in the Parisian chanson at the time of [[Cl<U+00E9>ment Janequin]], with clear diction, short phrases, general avoidance of dense [[polyphony]], and abundant parallel imperfect intervals.  He used these same simple textures in his sacred music, textures which contrasted considerably with the dense [[counterpoint]] being written by the Netherlanders of his generation (composers such as [[Nicolas Gombert]]).<ref name="Bernstein, Grove online"/>

Most of his motets appeared in 1555, in a publication by Le Roy & Ballard, ''Petri Cadeac musici excellentissima moteta''.  The 18 pieces in this set are for from four to six voices.  This publication was the biggest single print of his music of the time.
