'''Markus N<U+00E4>slund''' (born [[July 30]], [[1973]]) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] professional  [[ice hockey]] player with the [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. Prior to signing with the Rangers, N<U+00E4>slund spent 12&nbsp;years with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], including seven as team captain. Referred to as "Nazzy" by Canucks fans and "Macke" or "Mackan" in his native Sweden, he is one of the last NHL players to continue using a wooden [[Ice hockey stick|stick]].<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article132874.ece| title=Forsberg f<U+00E5>r Flyers att lyfta 	| accessdate=2008-07-26| date=2005-12-28| language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb| last=Shaikin| first=Stacy |title=These books bound for glory| url=http://www.calgarysun.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=108454&x=articles&s=lifestyle| publisher=Calgary Sun |date=2005-10-13| accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

Originally drafted in the first round by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], N<U+00E4>slund is a three-time [[NHL All-Star Team|First Team All-Star]], chosen in [[2001-02 NHL season|2002]], [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]] and [[2003-04 NHL season|2004]]. In 2003, he won the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] and was a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] nominee. After being traded to Vancouver in [[1995-96 NHL season|1996]], he became the franchise leader in goals and points. In 12&nbsp;seasons with the Canucks, he was named [[Cyclone Taylor Trophy|team MVP]] five times and led the team in scoring for seven consecutive seasons<U+2014>both team records.
 
Internationally, N<U+00E4>slund has represented [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] on many occasions, winning two bronze medals and a silver at the [[World Ice Hockey Championships|World Championships]], as well as two silvers as a junior at the [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Championships]], where he holds the record for most goals scored in a single tournament.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Markus N<U+00E4>slund began his career playing in Sweden's highest-level junior league, the [[J20 SuperElit]]. While playing with [[MODO Hockey]]'s junior team, N<U+00E4>slund and his childhood friend, [[Peter Forsberg]], formed one of the most dangerous lines in the league.<ref name=modo2005> {{citeweb |title= 2003 NHL MVP out at least eight weeks| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1971559| publisher=ESPN| date=2005-01-21| accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> After playing for MODO in [[Elitserien|Sweden's senior league]] as a 17&nbsp;year old, N<U+00E4>slund was drafted 16th overall in the [[1991 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].  Remaining in Sweden for two more years before entering the NHL in [[1993<U+2013>94 NHL season|1993<U+2013>94]], N<U+00E4>slund continued to play for MODO alongside Forsberg, leading the team in scoring for the 1991<U+2013>92 season. 

Upon entering the NHL with the Penguins, N<U+00E4>slund struggled to find his form. Although he showed promise in training camp and in practices, his play in games was inconsistent.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund trade no big deal back then| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_116086.html| publisher=Pittsburg Tribune-Review| accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> His first [[NHL]] goal came against [[Curtis Joseph]] of the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], 13&nbsp;games into his rookie campaign.<ref name=playerbio>{{citeweb|title=Vancouver Canucks - Team: N<U+00E4>slund Naslund Official Player Page|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app?page=PlayerDetail&playerId=8458530&service=page&tab=bio|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> He would finish his rookie season with only four goals and seven assists despite playing in 71 games.  In the labour dispute shortened [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL season]], his second in the NHL, N<U+00E4>slund scored four points in 14&nbsp;games.

On [[March 20]], [[1996]], near the end of the [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96 season]], N<U+00E4>slund's most prolific with the Penguins, he was acquired by the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in exchange for [[Alek Stojanov]]. This trade would later be regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history once N<U+00E4>slund displayed his offensive capabilities.<ref>{{citeweb|last=Montgomery|first=Ted|title=Eight Awful NHL Trades|url=http://sports.aol.com/nhl/story/_a/eight-awful-nhl-trades/20080214094709990001|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/penguins/2006-04-20-gm-patrick-out_x.htm | title= GM Craig Patrick leaves Penguins after 17 years |publisher=USA Today| accessdate=2008-07-25| date=2006-04-20}}</ref> In his first two seasons with the Canucks, N<U+00E4>slund's  offensive output did not change significantly. At the start of the [[1997<U+2013>98 NHL season|1997<U+2013>98 season]], coach [[Mike Keenan]] scratched a healthy N<U+00E4>slund, prompting N<U+00E4>slund to ask the team for a trade.

At the Canucks' training camp in Sweden, prior to the [[2000<U+2013>01 NHL season]], [[general manager]] [[Brian Burke (executive)|Brian Burke]] named N<U+00E4>slund [[team captain|captain]] of the Canucks, making N<U+00E4>slund the first European-born captain in Canucks history.<ref name=timeline/><ref name=contractExtension>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/28/naslund010628.html| title= Canucks extend Naslund's contract| date=2001-06-19| accessdate=2008-07-25| publisher=CBC}}</ref> The Canucks' predecessor as captain, [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Mark Messier]] has been cited by N<U+00E4>slund as his greatest influence, having played alongside him the previous three seasons.<ref>{{citeweb|last=Samuelson|first=Karl|title=Naslund proves worth the wait|url=http://www.nhl.com/intheslot/read/indepth/Naslund/main.html|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref> That year, N<U+00E4>slund went on to set personal highs in goals and points, and led the Canucks to their first [[playoff]] appearance since 1996. However, his 41-goal, 75-point campaign would be cut short late in the season by a broken leg. N<U+00E4>slund suffered the injury on [[March 16]], [[2001]], in a game against the [[Buffalo Sabres]].  Chasing a loose puck in the third period, he was hit by Sabres defencemen [[Jay McKee]] and [[Rhett Warrener]] simultaneously, falling awkwardly on his right leg.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund has surgery to repair broken leg|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/03/18/naslund010318.html|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2001-03-18|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]]}}</ref> Without N<U+00E4>slund in the lineup, the Canucks lost their first round best-of-seven playoff series against the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in four straight games.<ref name=contractExtension/>
N<U+00E4>slund returned from his injury the following season, breaking his personal record with a 90-point season which included 40&nbsp;goals.

Once centreman [[Brendan Morrison]] became the regular third member of N<U+00E4>slund and [[Todd Bertuzzi]]'s forward line in [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|2002<U+2013>03]], the usual Vancouver top line was established. The high-scoring line was dubbed the West Coast Express, named after [[West Coast Express|Vancouver's commuter rail service]] of the same name. That season, N<U+00E4>slund finished second overall in NHL scoring with a career high 48&nbsp;goals and 104&nbsp;points. Complemented by Bertuzzi's fifth place finish in league scoring and Morrison's career high 71&nbsp;points, the N<U+00E4>slund-Morrison-Bertuzzi line was considered to be the most effective line combination in the league that season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/sports/story.html?id=7707b0e2-2f29-4893-a435-8b0fe6bdf7d0| title= Emotional time for Naslund| date=2007-11-27| accessdate=2008-07-25| publisher=The Province}}</ref>

The [[2002<U+2013>03 NHL season|2002<U+2013>03 season]], statistically N<U+00E4>slund's best, culminated with him winning the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]] and finishing as first runner-up for the [[Hart Trophy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/06/12/pearson0612.html |title= Naslund wins Pearson Award| accessdate=2008-07-25| date=2003-06-12| publisher=CBC}}</ref> However, despite these achievements, the season ended disappointingly. The Canucks lost their final game of the regular season to the [[Los Angeles Kings]], and along with it, the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]] championship.  N<U+00E4>slund began the night as the league's leading scorer, but would lose the [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] and [[Rocket Richard Trophy| Rocket Richard Trophies]] to Peter Forsberg because of his failure to match the three points that Forsberg scored the same night. After the game, N<U+00E4>slund apologized to the sellout home crowd, to the point of saying that the team "choked."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/04/06/kingscanucks.html | title=Canucks lose Northwest, now face Blues|publisher=CBC  |accessdate=2008-07-25 | date=2003-04-06}}</ref> Vancouver won its first round playoff matchup against the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] in seven games after trailing three games to one. The Canucks then lost to the [[Minnesota Wild]] in the next round, failing to finish off a 3<U+2013>1 series lead of their own.<ref name=timeline/> N<U+00E4>slund would finish the playoffs with 14&nbsp;points in 14&nbsp;games.

N<U+00E4>slund led the Canucks in scoring for the sixth-straight season in [[2003<U+2013>04 NHL season|2003<U+2013>04]], finishing with 35&nbsp;goals and 84&nbsp;points. Near the end of the season, N<U+00E4>slund and the Canucks became the centre of attention among sports circles with the [[Todd Bertuzzi#Steve Moore incident|Steve Moore incident]].  On [[February 16]], [[2004]], N<U+00E4>slund sustained a minor concussion as Colorado forward [[Steve Moore]] delivered a questionable hit on N<U+00E4>slund at centre ice. Replays appeared to show that Moore hit N<U+00E4>slund's head with his elbow and shoulder, but referees did not call a [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]]. N<U+00E4>slund, who at the time was the league's leading scorer, required 13&nbsp;stitches and was sidelined for three games.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks lose Naslund for a week| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/02/17/naslund-hit0217.html| publisher=CBC| date=2004-02-26| accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/03/03/naslund0303.html |title=Canucks, Naslund won't chase revenge against Avs| accessdate=2008-07-26| date=2004-03-03| publisher=CBC}}</ref> As the Canucks and Avalanche met again on [[March 8]], linemate Todd Bertuzzi retaliated to the hit on N<U+00E4>slund and punched Moore in the back of the head late in the third period.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Police investigate Canucks' Bertuzzi for hit on Moore| url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/sports/national/2004/03/09/Sports/avs-canucks0308.html |publisher=CBC |date=2004-03-10| accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Moore was severely injured and the Canucks lost Bertuzzi for the remainder of the season to an indefinite suspension.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Bertuzzi reinstated by NHL |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2005/08/08/bc_bertuzzi20050808.html| publisher=CBC |date=2005-08-08| accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
N<U+00E4>slund was born to Ulla and Sture N<U+00E4>slund in [[<U+00D6>rnsk<U+00F6>ldsvik]], [[Sweden]], the same town that produced NHL star [[Peter Forsberg]] and N<U+00E4>slund's former Canucks teammates, [[Henrik Sedin|Henrik]] and [[Daniel Sedin]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund steps up as Canucks win fifth straight|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=221120022|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|last=Farber | first=Michael | title=Friend Or Foe?|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1028565/index.htm| date=2003-04-14|publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref>

Markus N<U+00E4>slund and his wife Lotta have three children: Rebecca, Isabella, and Alex.

My Captain!|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=363542|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> Like Swedes [[Nicklas Lidstr<U+00F6>m]] and his childhood idol, [[H<U+00E5>kan Loob]], N<U+00E4>slund had expressed a desire to raise his children in his homeland Sweden.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Naslund has some other goals in mind|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20030118/SKERR|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2003-01-08|accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> However, he also considered Vancouver his home and cherished his time spent in the city.<ref name=ocaptain/> 

In 2002, N<U+00E4>slund and Peter Forsberg founded [[Icebreakers]], an organization that raises money for children's charities through hosting exhibition games featuring current and former professional hockey players.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Star-studded Icebreakers play summer hockey for a cause| url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=335508|publisher=National Hockey League| date=2007-08-01| accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> In Vancouver, N<U+00E4>slund ran a program called "Nazzy's&nbsp;Suite&nbsp;19" that gave underprivileged children the opportunity to attend Canucks games.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Nazzy's Suite| url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&bcid=461#nazzy| publisher=Vancouver Canucks| accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> Along with other Canucks players, N<U+00E4>slund made regular visits to Canucks Place, a children's hospice that provides specialized care for children with life-threatening illnesses.
