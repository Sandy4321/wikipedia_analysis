'''Jon Macy''' (b. September 11, 1964) is a gay American comics writer and artist. He began his career in 1990 with the series ''Tropo''. Since then he has contributed to various [[LGBT]] [[comics]] anthologies and [[gay pornographic magazines]], but is best known for his graphic novel ''Teleny and Camille'', an adaptation of the anonymous 1893 erotic novel [[Teleny]] often attributed to [[Oscar Wilde]] and his circle of friends.

Macy's first series ''Tropo'' was part of the early 1990s black and white [[alternative comics]] boom. It was followed by the erotic horror series ''Nefarismo''. His work
was known for its dark surreal motifs. Macy often combined erotically charged images with hallucination and death.

During this time Macy was a contributor to queer comics anthologies such as ''Meatmen'' and [[Gay Comix|''Gay Comics'']], as well as, gay skin magazines such as ''Steam'', ''Bunkhouse'' and ''International Leatherman''. His work on ''Meatmen'' included a short story titled "Tail". In his paper "Dreamboys, Meatmen and Werewolves: Visualizing Erotic Identities in All-male Comic Strips" (2005) Gilad Padva argues that Macy's "Tail" eroticizes and politicizes [[Sigmund Freud]]<U+2019>s homophobic myth of the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]].<ref>Gilad Padva, "Dreamboys, Meatmen and Werewolves: Visualizing Erotic Identities in All-male Comic Strips", ''Sexualities'', December 2005, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 587-599.</ref> in the academic journal Sexualities. Macy was commissioned to create regular strips for the gay pornographic magazines ''Steam'', ''Wilde'', ''Bunkhouse'', and ''International Leatherman''.

Macy is best known for his graphic novel ''Teleny and Camille'' (Northwest Press 2010) a comic book adaptation of the classic early gay anonymous novel ''Teleny'' attributed to Oscar Wilde and circle. ''Teleny and Camille'' won the 2010 [[Lambda Literary Award]] for Gay Erotica.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/25/comic-con-2011-lgbt-comic_n_908791.html#s315924&title=Jon_Macy</ref> An excerpt was featured in ''Teleny Revisited'', a special issue of ''The Oscholars'',<ref>http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Specials/Teleny/titlepage.htm</ref> the only official academic evaluation of the source novel ''Teleny''.
