"'''Oh Santa!'''" is a [[Christmas music|Christmas]] song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released by [[Island Records]] on October 11, 2010 as the lead single from her second [[Christmas album]], ''[[Merry Christmas II You]]'' (2010). The song was co-written and co-produced by Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Bryan-Michael Cox]]. The song received mixed to positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the musicality of the song, but felt that it was substandard to Carey's iconic Christmas song "All I Want for Christmas is You".

"Oh Santa!" achieved moderate chart success, peaking at the top of the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Holiday Digital Songs chart and [[Adult Contemporary]] chart, as well as managing to peak at number 100 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, while peaking at number 68 on the [[Japan Hot 100]] chart and 73 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] chart. Carey performed the song on several live televised shows, including her own Christmas television special, entitled "Mariah Carey: Merry Christmas to You". A [[music video]] for the song, which was directed by Ethan Lader, was released on November 2, 2010. It portrayed Carey as the host of a fictional Christmas television show.
