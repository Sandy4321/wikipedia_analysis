'''Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base''' {{airport codes||OKAJ}} is a [[Kuwait]] Air Force installation with part designated for operations by the [[U.S. Air Force]] and its allies. 

Sitting 75 miles south of the [[Iraq]]i border, the base has supported active duty Air Force, [[Air National Guard]] and [[Air Force Reserve]] [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] and [[F-16]] fighter units, along with support individuals, rotated in and out. At Al Jaber AB, the 332 ELS Commander and 10 personnel were on one-year tours; all others (1190 personnel) rotated every 90 to 120 days. 

On 1 December 1998, the 4406th Operations Group (Provisional) at Al Jaber Air Base inactivated and the 332nd Air Expeditionary Group activated.<ref>Globalsecurity.org, Joint Task Force Southwest Asia, accessed January 2009</ref>

According to [[USA Today]] on [[22 October]] [[2003]] the US Ambassador to Kuwait, Richard Jones, announced that the United States was reducing its presence at Al Jaber with the intent of fully reducing its forces at that location. Aircraft normally at Al Jaber have departed for other locations.  USAF assets remaining in Kuwait are primarily stationed at [[Ali Al Salem Air Base]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}} <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Al_Salem_Air_Base</ref>
