'''Jo Elizabeth Stafford''' (November 12, 1917&nbsp;<U+2013> July 16, 2008<ref name=Boston/>) was an American singer of [[traditional pop music]] and occasional actress, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she was considered one of the most versatile vocalists of the era. Her 1952 song "[[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, and made her the first woman to have a No. 1 hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2001|title=British Hit Singles|edition=14th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|page=28|isbn=0-85156-156-X}}</ref>  She was a 1961 [[Grammy Award]] winner for an album of comedic interpretations of popular songs produced with her second husband, [[Paul Weston]].

Born in [[Coalinga, California]], Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. After graduating high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who enjoyed moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part  of the cast of [[Twentieth Century Fox]]'s production of ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'', Stafford met the future members of [[The Pied Pipers]] and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader [[Tommy Dorsey]] hired them in 1939 to perform backup vocals for his orchestra.

In addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944 she recorded a series of pop standards for [[Capitol Records]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston, whom she married in 1952. She also performed duets with [[Gordon MacRae]] and [[Frankie Laine]]. Her work with the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) giving concerts for soldiers earned her the nickname G.I. Jo. Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) radio series ''[[The Chesterfield Supper Club]]'' and later appeared in television specials in the US and the UK, including two series, ''The Jo Stafford Show'', in 1954 and 1961, respectively.

Stafford married twice; firstly to musician John Huddleston around 1941 (the couple divorced in 1943), then to Paul Weston in 1952, with whom she had two children. She and Weston developed  a comedy routine in which they assumed the identity of a bad lounge act named Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, parodying well-known songs. The act proved popular at parties and among the wider public when the couple released an album as the Edwardses in 1957. The album, ''[[Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris]]'', won Stafford her only Grammy Award, for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]] in 1961, and was the first commercially successful parody album. Stafford largely retired as a performer in the mid-1960s, but continued in the music business.  She enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity in the late 1970s when she recorded a cover of the [[Bee Gees]] hit, "[[Stayin' Alive]]" as Darlene Edwards. In the 1990s she began re-releasing  some of her material through [[Corinthian Records]], a label founded by her husband. She died in 2008 in [[Century City, Los Angeles]], and is interred with Weston at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]]. Her work in radio, television and music is recognized by three stars on the [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Early years==
[[File:Stafford sisters 1941.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The singing Stafford Sisters in 1941]]
Stafford was born in [[Coalinga, California]] in 1917 to Grover Cleveland and Anna (n<U+00E9>e York) Stafford, a second cousin of World War I hero [[Alvin C. York|Sergeant Alvin York]]. Both parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family.<ref name=Sherbrooke/> Her father had hopes  of success in the California oil fields when he moved his family from [[Gainesboro, Tennessee]];  what he found instead was a succession of unrelated jobs. When he worked for a private girls' school, Grover was allowed to bring the school's phonograph home on Christmas. Stafford  remembered hearing "Whispering Hope" on it as a small child. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs that would influence her daughter's later career.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2419478/Jo-Stafford.html|title=Jo Stafford|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

Stafford's first public singing appearance came in Long Beach, where the family lived when she  was twelve. She sang "Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms", a Stafford family sentimental favorite.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o2pFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SrwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7354,684630&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=The Marquee|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=August 5, 1954|publisher=The Telegraph-Herald|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref> Her second was far more dramatic.

Stafford claimed that her arrangement had to be adapted, as Astaire had difficulty with some of the [[syncopation]]. In her words: "The man with the syncopated shoes couldn't do the syncopated notes".<ref name="Interview"/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=59yGOQmBWloC&pg=PA105&dq=jo+stafford+interview&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XrONUIrAJoWWyAGdmoGQBg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=jo%20stafford%20interview&f=false|title=Puttin' On the Ritz: Fred Astaire and the Fine Art of Panache, A Biography|editor-last=Levinson|editor-first=Peter|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|page=105|isbn=0-312-35366-9|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

==The Pied Pipers==
[[File:Pied pipers stafford.JPG|thumb||200px|Stafford when she was with The Pied Pipers]]
By 1938, the Staffords were involved in the Twentieth Century Fox production of ''Alexander's Ragtime Band''. The studio brought in many vocal groups to work on the film, including [[The Four Esquires]], The Rhythm Kings and [[The King Sisters]]. With plenty of time between takes, the various groups sang and socialized while waiting to be called. The Four Esquires and The Rhythm Kings became a new vocal group, [[The Pied Pipers]], along with Stafford.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name="Ber2008"/> 

She later recalled, "We started singing together just for fun, and these  sessions led to the formation of an eight-voice singing group that we christened 'The Pied Pipers{{' "}}.{{sfn|Weston|2012|p=13}} The group consisted of eight members including Stafford: John Huddleston (Stafford's first husband from 1941 to 1943), Hal Hooper, Chuck Lowry, Bud Hervey, George Tait, Woody Newbury, and [[Dick Whittinghill]].<ref name="Obit">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qMM0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=XyEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=5356,1502720&dq=perry+como+person+to+person&hl=en|title=Singer Jo Stafford dies of heart failure at age 90|date=July 18, 2008|publisher=Lodi News-Sentinel|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> 

As The Pied Pipers, they worked on local radio and movie [[soundtrack]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5B8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=beat+the+band+como&source=bl&ots=sIcIGGPtzc&sig=BYRgwK53GCT5dyzHoT1929kE0mk&hl=en&ei=jJ4FTaPjA8GVnwfwk-3lDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=beat%20the%20band%20como&f=false|title=Pied Pipers Ad|page=56|year=1943|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}</ref> When Alyce and Yvonne King had a party for their boyfriends' visit to Los Angeles, the group was invited along to give a performance.<ref name=Hall/> The King Sisters' boyfriends were [[Tommy Dorsey]]'s [[arrangement|arrangers]] [[Axel Stordahl]] and Paul Weston, who became interested in the group.<ref name=Telegraph/> Weston described the vocals of the group as unique for its time; his assessment was that their vocal arrangements were much like those for orchestral instruments.<ref name=Pipers>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mTM_9JTeoMIC&pg=PA52&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en&ei=jtqGTenhIcq80QGA96DGCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=jo%20stafford&f=false|title=American Singing Groups: A History from 1940s to Today|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Jay|year=2006|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|pages=51<U+2013>53|isbn=0-634-09978-7|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref>

After Weston persuaded Dorsey to audition the group in 1938, the eight drove cross-country to New York City together for the chance.<ref name=Telegraph/> Dorsey liked them enough to sign them for ten weeks. After the second broadcast, the sponsor, visiting from overseas, heard them sing "Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)". Until this point, the sponsor knew only that he was paying for Dorsey's program and that the program's ratings were very good; [[transcription disc]]s mailed to him by his advertising agency always arrived broken. His opinion was that the performance was off-color, and he prevailed on the advertising agency representing his brand to fire the group.<ref name=Hall/><ref name=Pipers/><ref name=Lees>{{cite book|url=http://www.amazon.com/Singers-Song-Gene-Lees/dp/0195060873/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1351923668&sr=1-1&keywords=0195060873#reader_0195060873|title=Singers and the Song|editor-last=Lees|editor-first=Gene|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|pages=154<U+2013>176|isbn=0-19-506087-3|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref> They stayed in New York for several months, landing only a single job that paid them $3.60 each, but managed to record some material for [[RCA|RCA Victor Records]].<ref name=Telegraph/> Weston later said that he and Stordahl felt responsibility for the group, since it was Weston who had made the arrangements for their audition with Dorsey. The two men felt embarrassment when running into them and because they both were still employed by Dorsey.<ref name=Hall/>

With no work in New York, The Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles. Soon after arriving home, Stafford received a phone call from Dorsey, saying he could use the group, but four members only. Half of the group, including Stafford, arrived in Chicago in 1939; this led to success,  especially for Stafford, who was also featured in solo performances.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p_ZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HoUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2457,3130948&dq=elmo+tanner&hl=en|title=Announcer remembers top bands of the past|date=November 5, 1987|author=Roberts.

In 1942, the group had an argument with Dorsey and left; when the singers and Dorsey parted company, the number one song in the United States was "[[There Are Such Things]]" by Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers.<ref name=Pipers/> The group appeared on the radio shows of Sinatra, [[Bob Crosby]] and [[Johnny Mercer]].

==Solo career==
[[File:Perry Como Jo Stafford Chesterfield Supper Club 1947.jpg|250px|thumb|Jo Stafford and Perry Como at the Supper Club "going away" party, prior to her leaving for California to host the program there]]
In 1944, after her divorce from Huddlestone, Stafford left the Pied Pipers to go solo, becoming the first solo artist signed by Capitol Records. While still working for Dorsey, Mercer said to Stafford, "Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me." She was signed  to the label before it was a year old.<ref name=Lees/><ref name=NewYorker/>

===United Service Organizations===
Her tenure with the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), in which she gave many performances for soldiers stationed in the  US, led to her acquiring the nickname "G.I. Jo."<ref name="Obit"/><ref name=Hall/> On returning from the [[Pacific war|Pacific theater]], a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the US troops homesick enough to surrender. She personally replied to all letters she received from servicemen.<ref name=Boston/><ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Lees/> 

Stafford was a favorite of many servicemen in both World War II and [[Korean War|Korea]]; her recordings received a lot of airplay on [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio]] and in some military hospitals at lights out. Stafford's involvement with servicemen led to an interest in military history and a sound knowledge of it. Years after World War II, Stafford was a guest at a dinner party with a retired naval officer. When the discussion turned to an action off [[Mindanao]] during the war, the officer attempted to correct Stafford, who held to her point. He countered with saying, "Madame, I was there"; a few days after the party, Stafford received a note of apology from him, saying he had re-read his logs and that she was correct, after all.<ref name=Lees/>

===Chesterfield Supper Club===
Beginning in late 1945, she hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of an NBC musical variety radio program ''[[The Chesterfield Supper Club]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ty5JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-YMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4368,2971749&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Actresses and Vocalists Star On Networks|date=December 9, 1945|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Chesterfield">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TEoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA78&dq=perry+como&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=25#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false |title=Full-page ad for the Chesterfield Supper Club |date=January 13, 1947|publisher=Life Magazine|page=78|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> On April 5, 1946, Stafford, [[Perry Como]] and the entire radio show cast participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the same type of stand-held microphones used in studio work; when they proved to be a problem, the cast resorted to hand-held ones, which became heavy and difficult to hold due to the plane's cabin pressure. Two flights were made that evening, one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iuMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mWQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1527,6651826&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Big Plane To Serve As Broadcast Studio|date=March 28, 1946|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mh0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ECUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1922,3325213&dq=martin+block&hl=en|title=Flyin' High|author=BCL|date=April 8, 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref>

Weston, who was the conductor of her ''Supper Club'' broadcasts, suggested using some of them on the program. With the rediscovery of the folk tunes came an interest in folklore;  Stafford established a contest which was awarded to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The awards were handled by the [[American Folklore Society]].<ref name=Sherbrooke>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T7VNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VkQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1860,7232176&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=Jo Stafford of CBS 'Club  15'|date=February 23, 1950|publisher=The Sherbrooke Telegram|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Duets and Voice of America===
Stafford duetted on a number of songs with [[Gordon MacRae]]. In 1948, their version of "Say Something Sweet to Your Sweetheart" sold over a million copies, and in 1949 they repeated their success with "My Happiness". Stafford also recorded "Whispering Hope" with MacRae that year.<ref name=Telegraph/> Stafford began hosting a weekly [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] radio program in 1950, recording the voice portions of the shows in Hollywood. She contributed her disk jockey talents without pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ACpQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uQsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5559,614177&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=Chirper Jo Stafford Spins U.S. Records For Europeans|author=Thomas, Bob|date=January 31, 1950|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref> At the time, she was also hosting ''Club 15'' for [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) radio, sharing those duties with [[Bob Crosby]] in the same way she did with Como on ''Chesterfield Supper Club''.<ref name=Sherbrooke/> By 1951, Stafford was also doing weekly radio work for [[Voice of America]] (VOA). ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' magazine published an article  about the program in its April 21, 1951 issue titled: "Jo Stafford: Her Songs Upset Joe Stalin"; this earned Stafford the wrath of the Communist newspaper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', which published a column critical of Stafford and VOA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r2IbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dE0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2478,2671450&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=Uncle Sam's Gal Jo Upsets Joe Stalin|date=July 8, 1951|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

Weston moved from Capitol to [[Columbia Records]], and in 1950, Stafford also left Capitol for Columbia.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, she had a string of popular hits with [[Frankie Laine]], six of which charted.  Their duet of [[Hank Williams]]' "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]" made the top ten in 1951. It was also at this time that Stafford scored her best known hits with huge records like "[[Jambalaya (song)|Jambalaya]]", "[[Shrimp Boats]]", "[[Make Love to Me]]", and "[[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]".<ref name=Obit/> 

"You Belong to Me" was Stafford's biggest hit, topping the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom; it was the first song by a female singer to top the UK chart. The record first appeared on US charts on August 1, 1952 and continued there for 24 weeks. In the UK, it went onto the charts on November 14, 1952 as number 12, reaching number one on January 16, 1953 and stayed on the charts for 19 weeks.<ref name=Whitburn>

===1960s===
In 1960, Stafford related there were good and bad points to working closely with her husband. She said that Weston's knowing her so well made it easy for him to arrange music for her, but that it also made it difficult at times, as Weston knew her abilities and would either write or arrange music that was elaborate because he was aware she was capable of performing the song ably. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals, as she felt her voice was not powerful enough for stage work.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QBYpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L9cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2710,5198621&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Hubby Writes It And Jo Warbles|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=November 26, 1960|publisher=The Southeast Missourian|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref>

Finding that she had time left over following a 1957 recording session, Stafford, as a gag, recorded a track as Darlene Edwards. At the time, the head of Columbia's [[artists and repertoire]] department was [[Mitch Miller]], who had been selecting songs like "Underneath the Overpass" and similar novelty-type songs for Stafford to record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bacharachonline.com/discography/|title=Underneath the Overpass|year=1957|author=Burt Bachrach and Hal David|publisher=Columbia Records|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref>  Because she did not agree with Miller's choices for her, Stafford and her studio musicians often recorded their own renditions of the music, performing the songs according to the way they felt about them.  This is how the Darlene Edwards character was born.<ref name=Hall/><ref name=Songbirds/> Those who heard [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]s of the recording responded positively, and later that year, Stafford and Weston recorded an entire album of songs as Jonathan and Darlene, entitled ''[[The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards]]''.  As a publicity stunt, Stafford and Weston claimed that the Edwardses were a [[New Jersey]] lounge act that they had discovered, and denied any personal connection.<ref name=talk/>

''The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards'' was followed up with a "pop standards" album, on which the pair intentionally butchered popular music. ''Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris'' was released in 1960 and won that year's Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. In a rare move, the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|Academy]] decided to issue two awards for the category that year; [[Bob Newhart]] also received an award for "Spoken Word Comedy."

Stafford and Weston began work on an autobiography in 1979. Titled ''The Ducks Are Drowning'' the book was to focus primarily on the early part of their careers, with anecdotes and stories from that era. But after putting together an outline and working on a rough draft they abandoned the project the following year because of a lack of interest from publishers.

==Film and television==
{{main|Jo Stafford filmography}}

Although Stafford appeared on screen many times throughout her career, her television work was restricted by a combination of poor eyesight that meant she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses, and the bright studio lights that caused her discomfort. Forced to memorize the scripts for any appearances she did make, Stafford declined several offers of television work for these reasons.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zbYtmOIHvfcC&pg=PA161&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en&ei=ANmGTe_pEpCJ0QGrtOXOCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=jo%20stafford&f=false|title=Discovering Great Singers of Classic Pop: A New Listener's Guide to the Sounds and Lives of the Top Performers|editor1-last=Hemming|editor-first=Roy|editor2-last=Hajdu|editor2-first=David|year=1999|publisher=Newmarket Press|pages=163<U+2013>164|isbn=1-55704-148-2|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref> Her film and television appearances span the decades from the 1930s, when she appeared in films such as ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'',<ref name=Telegraph/> to her final appearance in the Frank Sinatra tribute ''Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come'' in 1990.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Sun/> Some of her film and television credits are listed below:
