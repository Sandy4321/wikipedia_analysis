The '''Marmes Rockshelter''' (also known as '''(45-FR-50)''') is an [[archaeological site]] first excavated in 1962,<ref name=Hicks4>{{harvnb|Hicks|2004|p=4}}</ref> near the confluence of the [[Snake River|Snake]] and [[Palouse River]]s, in [[Franklin County, Washington|Franklin County]], southeastern [[Washington]]. This rockshelter is remarkable in the level of preservation of organic materials, the depth of [[stratigraphy|stratified deposits]], and the apparent age of the associated [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[human remains]]. The site was discovered on the property of Roland Marmes, and was the site of the oldest human remains in North America at that time.<ref name=LeWarne>{{harvnb|LeWarne|2003|p=23-24}}</ref> In 1966, the site became, along with [[Fort Columbia State Park|Chinook Point]] and the [[San Juan Island National Historical Park|American and English Camps]] on San Juan Island, the first [[National Historic Landmark]]s listed in Washington.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/AboutUs/documents/WASTATESHPOTIMELINE_001.pdf |title= Washington State Historic Preservation Office - Timeline |accessdate= 2008-02-28}}</ref> In 1969, the site was submerged in water when a [[levee]] protecting it from waters rising behind the then newly constructed [[Lower Monumental Lock and Dam|Lower Monumental Dam]], which was {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} down the Snake River, failed to hold back water that leaked into the protected area through gravel under the soil,<ref name=LeWarne/> creating [[Lake Herbert G. West]].

==The excavation==
The existence of the site was first brought to the attention of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor.<ref name=WSU>{{cite web |url= http://www.archaeology.wsu.edu/county/franklin/45FR50/overview.html |title= The Marmes Rockshelter Site |accessdate= 2008-02-25}}</ref> Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and [[Roald H. Fryxell|Roald Fryxell]], a geologist, under the auspices of [[Washington State University]] (WSU)and the [[National Park Service]] in 1962, and continued until 1964.<ref name=Hicks4/> In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU,<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1978|p=37}}</ref> and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. [[Radiocarbon dating]] indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old.<ref>{{harvnb|Hicks|2004|p=10-11}}</ref> In 1968, Fryxell returned once again, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the [[United States Geological Survey]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1978|p=38}}</ref> and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Warren Magnuson]] made a public announcement of the finds.

==Inundation of the site==
After a bill that would have provided funds to protect the site failed, then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] that authorized funding for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to build a [[levee]] around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for.<ref name=WSU/> However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1978|p=41}}</ref>

The location of the site is still known today, and has come under some threat of erosion from the wakes of motorized vehicles on the lake.  The Army Corps of Engineers considers the site to be in stable condition with a "Satisfactory" threat rating since 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=558&ResourceType=Site |title= National Historic Landmarks Program Marmes Rockshelter Statement |accessdate= 2008-02-27}}</ref>

==Findings at the site==
[[Image:USACE Lower Monumental Dam.jpg|right|thumb|The creation of the Lower Monumental Dam raised the level of the Palouse River high enough to submerge the Marmes site completely under water.]]
The excavations at the site revealed evidence of human occupation from a period that lasted 8,000 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Downey|2000|p=16}}</ref> and that the area was home to humans as long ago as 11,230 years ago.<ref>{{harvnb|Hicks|2004|p=i}}</ref> The people living at the site hunted game such as elk and deer using [[atlatl]]s, and also hunted smaller mammals such as beavers, while they gathered mussels from the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Fiedel|1992|p=121}}</ref> The excavation turned up graves, which included beads carved from shells and spear points. One grave, that of a child, held five matching knives made of stone.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1970|p=20}}</ref> The excavation also turned up [[chalcedony]] and [[chert]] arrowheads. Those in the upper layers were made of [[agate]], which is not found in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1970|p=22}}</ref> Stone tools were found as well, such as scrapers for use in tanning hides, and [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]].<ref name=Kirk2324>{{harvnb|Kirk|1970|p=23-24}}</ref> In layers dated to 7,000 years ago, large amounts of shells belonging to a [[Olive shell|snail]] of the [[genus]] ''Olivella'' were found, which would have been imported from the [[West Coast of the United States]], {{convert|200|mi|km|0}} away. The majority of the shells had holes drilled through them, indicating that they had adorned necklaces.<ref name=Kirk2324/> 

In addition, one of the five known [[Indian Peace Medal|Jefferson Peace Medals]] was found associated with the most recent human remains at the site, evidently having been given to a local Native American leader (presumbaly of the [[Nez Perce]]) during the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]].  This medal has since been returned to the Nez Perce and reburied, as per [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.expeditions.com/DER_Details113.asp?DailyReport=144348&SearchSource=Main&Ship=1 |title= Expeditions Report on Palouse River |accessdate= 2008-02-27}}</ref>

Analyzing the pollen sequences at the site showed a steppe ecosystem immediately following the retreat of glaciers 13,000 years ago, which gave way to a mixed forest of pine and spruce, which led in to the current sagebrush prairie ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1978|p=56}}</ref>

==Implications of the findings==
Unlike many archaeologic finds, the human remains at the site were able to be dated with environmental, geologic, and archaeologic methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Kirk|1978|p=37}}</ref> Human remains at the site are the oldest that have been found in Washington, and at the time was the oldest set of remains found in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902217,00.html |title= The Man They Ate for Dinner |date= May 10, 1968 |work= Time Magazine |accessdate= 2008-02-27}}</ref> Later radiocarbon work has confirmed the original dating of this site, indicating that these human remains, albeit very fragmentary, are still some of the oldest ever excavated in the New World.<ref>A Reevaluation of the Marmes Rockshelter Radiocarbon Chronology. John C. Sheppard; Peter E. Wigand; Carl E. Gustafson; Meyer Rubin. American Antiquity, Vol. 52, No. 1. (Jan., 1987), pp. 118-125.</ref> This finding was useful in confirming the early chronology of the region and confirming the antiquity of the styles of associated bone tools.
