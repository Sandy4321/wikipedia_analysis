'''Belmont''' is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap County]], [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]].  The population was 7,356 at the 2010 census.<ref>United States Census Bureau, [http://factfinder2.census.gov/main.html American FactFinder], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.</ref>

The primary settlement in town, where 1,301 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Belmont [[census-designated place]] (CDP) and includes the densely-populated portion of the town near the intersection of [[New Hampshire Route 106]] and [[New Hampshire Route 140]].

==History==
[[Image:Main Street Looking South, Belmont, NH.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1908]]
Originally known as '''Upper Gilmanton''', Belmont was chartered in 1727 as a parish of [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]]. With [[water power]] from the [[Tioga River (New Hampshire)|Tioga River]], it developed as a [[mill town]].<ref name="belmontnh.homestead.com">[http://belmontnh.homestead.com/Millsmillstreet.html History of the Belmont Mill (1833-2007)]</ref> Built in 1833, the Gilmanton Village Manufacturing Co. made [[cotton]] and [[woolen]] [[textiles]]. Over the years it would change owners, names and products. In 1921, it was the Belmont Hosiery Co., a maker of [[silk]], [[lisle]] and woolen [[stockings]]. It went out of business in 1955, and the renovated mill building is now a [[community center]].<ref name="belmontnh.homestead.com"/>

Separated from Gilmanton by an act of [[New Hampshire General Court|legislature]], the town was incorporated in 1859 as Upper Gilmanton. The name Belmont was adopted in 1869 to honor [[August Belmont]], a wealthy financier who (it was hoped) would contribute to the nascent town, but he never acknowledged the act.<ref>[http://www.nh.gov/nhes/elmi/htmlprofiles/belmont.html New Hampshire Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau Profile]</ref>
