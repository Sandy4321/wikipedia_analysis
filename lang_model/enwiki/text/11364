'''Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n''' (1775<U+2013>1849) was the matriarch of one of the prominent founding families of early Texas. Do<U+00F1>a Patricia raised ten children, some of whom helped change the course of history. At age 49, she uprooted her life in 1824 to help her husband [[Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n]] establish the predominantly Mexican [[De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony (Texas)|De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony]]. She contributed her inherited assets to the founding of the colony, and helped establish a school and a church. From the onset, she worked to instill a sense of Mexican and Spanish culture in the colony. After the death of her husband, Do<U+00F1>a Patricia assumed the role of head of the family. [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] number 6539 placed at Evergreen Cemetery in 1972 acknowledges Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n's contribution to Texas.<ref name="Evergreen"/> [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] number 6543 placed at Church and Bridge Streets in 1936 denotes the home of Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n and Don Martin De Le<U+00F3>n's home in Victoria.<ref name="DL Home"/>

==Early life==
Do<U+00F1>a Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n was born in 1775 in [[Soto la Marina]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]], to a wealthy family headed by her father Felipe de la Garza.<ref name="Las Tejanas">{{cite book|last=Acosta|first=Teresa Palomo|title=Las Tejanas: 300 Years of History|year=2003|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292705272|pages=20, 21, 22, 23, 24|coauthors=Winegarten, Ruthe}}</ref>

==Marriage and children==

In 1795, she married [[Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n]] and settled with him at his ranch in [[Cruillas Municipality|Cruillas]]. Mart<U+00ED>n sold wild mustangs, mules and cattle in [[New Orleans]].<ref name="Las Tejanas"/> The couple's first child [[Fernando De Le<U+00F3>n|Fernando]] was born at the Cruillas ranch in 1798.<ref name="Patricia">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Paula|title=Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde66|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

The couple moved their base of ranching operations in 1799 to [[San Patricio County, Texas]], where three more children were born. Daughter Candelaria was born in 1800, son [[Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n|Silvestre]] in 1802, and daughter Guadalupe in 1804.<ref name="Las Tejanas"/>

The Spanish government granted the family land on the east bank of the [[Aransas River]], north of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] in 1805. Son Felix was born there in 1806 and son Agapito in 1808. While at this location in 1807, Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n registered the family's cattle brand, the first registered brand in what would become Texas.<ref name="Las Tejanas"/>

The family moved to south of the [[Nueces River]] in 1810, where daughter Maria was born that year. Indian depredations increased as the Spanish government withdrew troops. The family moved northward to just outside of [[San Antonio]] where three daughters were born. Refugia arrived in 1812, Augustina in 1814 and Francisca in 1818.<ref name="Las Tejanas"/><ref name="MDeLeon">{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde08|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate= 23 March 2011}}</ref>

==Establishing Victoria, Texas==
{{Main|De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony (Texas)}}On April 13, 1824, the provisional Mexican government granted Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n an empresario contract to settle forty-one Mexican families on the lower [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe]] and [[Lavaca River|Lavaca]] rivers.<ref name="De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony">{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ued01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> At age 49, with her four adult children and six minor children, Patricia de la Garza De Le<U+00F3>n uprooted her life to become her husband's partner in the founding of [[De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony (Texas)|De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony]]. She gave her inheritance of $9,800, plus another $300 valuation of cows, horses, and mules, in order to help get the colonization off the ground.<ref name="Las Tejanas"/>

At Victoria, Do<U+00F1>a Patricia transplanted cultural traditions of Mexico and Spain to the community. The De Le<U+00F3>n family lived in a log home with a dirt floor. Nevertheless, Do<U+00F1>a Patricia filled it with imported furniture provided to her from her family in Mexico. The family kept domestic servants, and the home became a community gathering place. She discouraged her children from using guns, for fear they would be perceived as bandits. She sent her children and grandchildren to school in Mexico and [[Spain]]. When [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Jes<U+00FA>s Carbajal]] platted the town, she made sure land was set aside for a school and a church. Her donation of $500 in gold helped to build and furnish the church.<ref name="Las Tejanas"/><ref name="Patricia"/>

==Death of Martin De Le<U+00F3>n==
Mart<U+00ED>n De Le<U+00F3>n died of [[cholera]] in 1833,<ref name="Wade 2008 12">{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Mary Dodson|title=Texas History|year=2008|publisher=Heinemann Library|isbn=978-1432911515|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Poyo|first=Gerald Eugene|title=Tejano Journey, 1770-1850|year=1996|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292765702|page=117}}</ref> and left an estate worth $500,000.<ref name="Wade 2008 12"/> Fernando took over the colony responsibilities of his father.<ref name="De Le<U+00F3>n's Colony"/> Do<U+00F1>a Patricia managed the family assets and continued her civic work.

==Exile==
The De Le<U+00F3>n extended family, like many Mexicans, were opposed to the regime of [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]]. Texas independence was a separate issue. As the issue did with other Mexicans living in Texas, it divided the De Le<U+00F3>n extended family, some of whom helped change the course of history in both Texas and Mexico. Divided loyalties among the Mexicans made them subject to suspicion and prejudice from the new [[Republic of Texas]] government and military establilshment.<ref>Chance (2006) p.42</ref>

Candelaria's husband Jos<U+00E9> Miguel Aldrete was 1835 state land commissioner of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. Aldrete joined several Texas insurgent groups to resist  Santa Anna.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huson|first=Hobart|title=Jos<U+00E9> Miguel Aldrete|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal04|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

Refugia married Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Jes<U+00FA>s Carbajal in 1832. Initially, he teamed up with Fernando De Le<U+00F3>n and [[Peter Kerr (Texas settler)|Peter Kerr]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=L. W|title=Peter Kerr|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fke35|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate= 22 March 2011}}</ref> to trade livestock for munitions to help his old friend and mentor [[Stephen F. Austin]]. Carbajal, however, felt his loyalties lay with the Mexican people, not the Texas cause. He moved across the [[Rio Grande]] and waged guerilla warfare in Mexico against Santa Anna's political machine.<ref name="Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Jes<U+00FA>s Carbajal">{{cite web|title=Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Jes<U+00FA>s Carbajal|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fca45|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> Do<U+00F1>a Patricia loaned Carbajal $6,000 for his cause.<ref>Chance (2006) p.154</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Jerry D|title=Cortina: Defending the Mexican Name in Texas|year=2007|publisher=TAMU Press|isbn=978-1585445929|pages=22, 23}}</ref> Fernando later became aide-de-camp to provisional Texas governor [[James W.

Augustina married [[Pl<U+00E1>cido Benavides]], who opposed Santa Anna's dictatorship, but felt Texas should remain part of Mexico. Benavides led a unit of [[Tejano]] fighters at the [[Battle of Goliad]]. He was recruited by [[Stephen F. Austin]] for the 1835 [[Siege of B<U+00E9>xar]] to drive [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]] out of Texas. Silvestre fought beside his brother-in-law Pl<U+00E1>cido at the Siege of B<U+00E9>xar.<ref name="Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n">{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde80|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>  Benavides earned himself the sobriquet of the "Texas Paul Revere" for his 1836 journey from [[San Patricio, Texas|San Patricio]] to [[Goliad]] to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H|title=Pl<U+00E1>cido Benavides|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbe46|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

Do<U+00F1>a Patricia's youngest son Agapito was murdered in 1836. In 1972, [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] number 6538 was designated in recognition of Agapito De Leon.<ref>{{cite web|title=THC-Agapito De Leon|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5469006538&site_name=De+Leon,+Agapito&class=5000|work=Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

On July 20, 1836, [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk|Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] ordered Mexican families in the Victoria area to be evacuated in an attempt to stem any assistance being given to Santa Anna. The Carbajal, Benavides and De Le<U+00F3>n families left for [[New Orleans]], forced to abandon their money and possessions.<ref>Chance (2006) p.43</ref> In Louisiana, they lived in poverty, and then moved  back with Do<U+00F1>a Patricia's family in Soto la Marina. She was able to sell 25,000 acres of land near Garcitias Creek for $10,000 in 1837.<ref name="Patricia"/>

Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n returned to Victoria in 1842 to try and reclaim the family's property, and was murdered by persons unknown.<ref name="Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n"/><ref>{{Find a Grave|16159467|Silvestre De Le<U+00F3>n}}</ref>

Do<U+00F1>a Patricia returned to Texas in 1844, only to find her assets had been redistributed among new settlers. In the new climate, she had lost her social standing in the community. She devoted the rest of her life in service to the local [[Catholic]] church.<ref name="Patricia"/>

Do<U+00F1>a Patricia died in 1849, and is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Victoria, Texas.<ref>{{Find a Grave|16159382|Patricia De Le<U+00F3>n}}</ref> Before her death, she had donated the original De Le<U+00F3>n homestead to the Catholic Church.
