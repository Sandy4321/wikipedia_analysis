'''Johannesburg''', also known as '''eGoli''' (place of gold), is the largest and most populous [[city]] in [[South Africa]]. The city is affectionately known as "Jo'burg", "Jozi" and "JHB" by South Africans. Johannesburg is the [[province|provincial]] [[capital]] of [[Gauteng Province|Gauteng]], the wealthiest province in South Africa, and the largest economy of any metropolitan region in Sub-Saharan Africa. The city is one of the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the world, and Africa's only officially designated [[global city]] (classified as a gamma world city). While often assumed to be South Africa's capital, Johannesburg does not form one of South Africa's three capital cities. Johannesburg does, however, house the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|South African Constitutional Court]] - South Africa's highest court. 

Johannesburg is the source of a large-scale [[gold]] and [[diamond]] [[trade]], due to its location on the [[mineral]]-rich [[Witwatersrand]] range of hills. Johannesburg is also served by [[O.R. Tambo International Airport]], the largest and busiest [[airport]] in Africa and a gateway for international air travel to and from the rest of [[southern Africa]].

According to the 2001 [[Statistics South Africa|Census]], the population of the city is more than three million. Johannesburg's land area of [[1 E9 m<U+00B2>|1,644 km<U+00B2>]] is very large when compared to other cities, resulting in a [[population density]] of only 1,962/km<U+00B2>. The population of the [[Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area]] is almost eight million. Johannesburg also encompasses [[Soweto]] to the south west, a [[township]] that the [[apartheid]] government established to accommodate the large number of [[migrant worker]]s.

== History ==
[[Image:langlaagte.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[farm]] where [[gold]] was first discovered in 1886.]]
[[Image:Johannesburg1931.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Central Business District of Johannesburg around 1931.]]
:''Main article: [[History of Johannesburg]]''
The region surrounding Johannesburg has been inhabited by man for millions of years. The [[Sterkfontein]] Caves, to the north west, have produced the most complete skeleton of a 3.3 million-year old hominid, as well as close to 700 specimens of a closely related species, Australopithecus africanus, among them [[Mrs Ples]], which is between 2.3 and 2.8 million years old.

It is theorised that the Johannesburg region was inhabited by the [[nomad]]ic [[Bushmen]] people, around 100,000 years ago. The Bushmen are said to have lived in the area until the [[Bantu language|Bantu]]-speaking people [[Bantu expansion|migrated]] into the area in about 1060 AD. The Bantu people were [[Iron Age]] people who [[domesticated animal]]s, farmed [[agriculture|crops]], worked [[metal]], made [[pottery]], and lived in organised [[village]]s.

The region remained inhabited by both the Bushmen and the Bantu people. When Europeans arrived in the area, small numbers of [[Boer]]s started farms, but there was no major European settlement until the 1880s, when [[gold]] was discovered in the region, triggering a [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|gold rush]].

Gold was initially discovered slightly to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in [[Barberton, South Africa|Barberton]]. [[Prospecting|Gold prospectors]] soon discovered that there were even richer [[gold reef]]s in the [[Witwatersrand]].

The town was initially much the same as any small prospecting settlement, but, as word spread, people flocked to the area from all other regions of the country, as well as from [[North America]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the rest of [[Europe]]. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the [[Boer]]s, who founded the town and in whose country (the ZAR) Johannesburg was located during the nineteenth century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]], culminating in the [[Second Boer War|Second Anglo-Boer War]]. The Boers lost the war and control of the area was ceded to the British.

The 1910 declaration of the [[Union of South Africa]] paved the way for a more organised mining structure. Later, the South African government instituted a harsh racial system whereby [[black]]s and [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]] were heavily taxed, barred from holding skilled jobs, and consequently forced to work as migrant labour on Johannesburg's growing crop of [[gold mine]]s.

The South African government then instituted a [[Group Areas Act|system of forced removals]], moving the population of non-European descent into specified areas. It is this system that created the sprawling shantytown of [[Soweto]] ('''So'''uth '''We'''stern '''To'''wnships), one of the areas where blacks were forced to live during the [[apartheid]] era. [[Nelson Mandela]] spent many years living in Soweto and his Soweto home in Orlando is currently a major [[tourist attraction]].

Large-scale [[violence]] broke out in 1976 when the [[Soweto Students' Representative Council]] organised protests against the use of [[Afrikaans]], considered to be the language of the oppressors,  as the primary language of instruction in black schools. [[Police]] shot into a student march. 1000 people died protesting the apartheid system, in the following 12 months. One of the most famous victims of the massacre, [[Hector Pieterson]], is commemorated with a large [[Hector Pieterson Museum|Museum]] dedicated to his memory, in Soweto.

The regulations of apartheid were abandoned in February 1990, and, since the 1994 elections, Johannesburg has been free of discriminatory laws.  The black [[township (South Africa)|townships]] have been integrated into the municipal government system, and, to some extent, the suburbs have become multiracial. However, there has been a large-scale migration of businesses and commerce away from the [[Central Business District]] and the southern suburbs, in favour of the more affluent northern suburbs.  This was fueled by a rise in the crime rate, serious traffic congestion, inadequate public transport, and a more favourable tax environment for landlords in the northern suburbs prior to the integration of the city. Currently the Johannesburg Metropolitan Council is implementing a large scale Inner City Revival project, leading to many business moving back to the inner city.

== Government ==
{{Johannesburg regions infobox}}
:''Main articles: [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]] and [[Regions of Johannesburg]]''
During the apartheid era, Johannesburg was divided into 11 local authorities, seven of which were white and four black or [[Coloured|coloured]]. The white authorities were 90 % self-sufficient from [[property tax]] and other local [[tax]]es, and spent [[South African Rand|Rand]] 600 ([[USD]]93) per person, while the black authorities were only 10% self-sufficient, spending R100 (USD15) per person.

The first post-apartheid [[Johannesburg City Council|City Council]] was created in 1995.  The council adopted the slogan "One City, One Taxpayer" in order to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution.  To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would help pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a [[autonomous region|substantially autonomous]] local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like [[Sandton]] and [[Randburg]], poorer neighbouring townships such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]], and informal settlements like [[Orange Farm]].

In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager in order to reshape the city's ailing financial situation. The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called "Igoli 2002". This was a three-year plan that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. The plan took the city from near [[insolvency]] to an operating [[surplus]] of R153 million (USD $23.6 million).

== Crime ==

After the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in the early 1990s, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor, mostly black, people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]]. Crime levels in formerly white areas rose. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]]. Many corporations and institutions, including the [[JSE Securities Exchange|stock exchange]], moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like [[Sandton]]. By the late 1990s, Johannesburg was rated as one of the most dangerous cities in the world.

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include [[closed-circuit television]] on street corners. Statistics show that crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow [http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=276659&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/]. In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], local government has enlisted the help of former New York mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament will be played in the city [http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/view_press_release.php?rID=16863].

== Geography and climate ==
Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa, known as the [[Highveld]], at an elevation of 1753 metres. The city is located on a small ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (White Water's Ridge: [[Afrikaans]]) and the city's northern and western suburbs have undulating hills, while the eastern metro area is generally flat.



The city enjoys a dry, sunny climate, with the exception of occasional late afternoon downpours in the summer months of October to April. 
Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild thanks to the city's high altitude, with the average maximum daytime temperature in January of 26<U+00BA>C, dropping to an average maximum of around 16<U+00B0>C in June. During the winter, the temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at nightime, causing [[frost]]. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in September 1981 and light snow in August 2006. The annual average rainfall is 713mm, which is mostly concentrated in the summer months.

Despite the relatively dry climate, Johannesburg has about six million trees, and it is often claimed that the city has the largest man-made forest in the world. Many trees were originally planted in the northern areas of the city at the end of the 19th century, to provide wood for the mining industry. The areas were developed by a German immigrant, who called the forest estates Sachsenwald. The name was changed to Saxonwold, now the name of a suburb, during World War I. White residents who moved into the areas, now generally referred to as the Northern Suburbs, retained many of the original trees and planted new ones, with the encouragement of successive city councils. In recent years, however, a considerable number of trees have been felled, to make way for the Northern Suburbs' speedy residential and commercial redevelopment. The city is, therefore, at risk of losing its forest coverage within a few decades.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:ZA Joburg language.gif|thumb|right|250px|Geographical distribution of home languages in Johannesburg.]] 

According to the 2001 [[Statistics South Africa|South African National Census]], the population of Johannesburg is 3,225,812 people, though including the East Rand and other suburban areas it's around 7 million, consisting of people who live in 1,006,930 formal households, of which 86% have a flush or chemical [[toilet]], and 91% have [[refuse]] removed by the municipality at least once a week. 81% of households have access to running water, and 80% use [[electricity]] as the main source of energy. 22% of Johannesburg residents stay in informal dwellings. 66% of households are headed by one person.

Black Africans account for 73% of the population, followed by whites at 16%, [[coloured|coloureds]] at 6% and Asians at 4%. 42% of the population is under the age of 24, while 6% of the population is over 60 years of age. 37% of city residents are [[unemployed]]. 91% of the unemployed are black. Women comprise 43% of the working population. 19% of economically active adults work in wholesale and retail sectors, 18% in financial, [[real estate]] and business services, 17% in community, social and personal services and 12% are in manufacturing. Only 0.7% work in [[mining]].

34% of Johannesburg residents speak [[Nguni]] languages at home, 26% speak [[Sotho languages|Sotho]] languages, 19% speak [[English language|English]], and 8% speak [[Afrikaans]]. 29% of adults have graduated from [[high school]]. 14% have higher education ([[University]] or [[Technical school]]). 7% of residents are completely [[illiterate]]. 15% have primary education.

34% use [[public transportation]] to [[commuting|commute]] to [[employment|work]] or [[school]]. 32% walk to work or school. 34% use private transportation to travel to work or school.

53% belong to mainstream [[Christianity|Christian]] churches. 24% are [[Atheist]]. 14% are members of [[African Independent Churches]]. 3% are [[Islam|Muslim]]. 1% is [[Judaism|Jewish]]. 1% is [[Hinduism|Hindu]].

== Economy ==
[[Image:Joburg top.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The skyline of Johannesburg's [[Central Business District (Johannesburg)|Central Business District]] as seen from the observatory of the [[Carlton Centre]].]]

Johannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16 % of South Africa's [[gross domestic product]], and accounts for 40 % of Gauteng's economic activity.  [[Mining]] is the foundation of the [[Witwatersrand]]'s economy, but its importance is gradually declining. While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies have their [[headquarters]] in Johannesburg. The city has a great variety of manufacturing industries, including [[steel]] and [[cement]] plants. Many banking and commercial companies are also located in Johannesburg.  Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Securities Exchange]].  Due to its commercial importance, this city is the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions that are usually found only in capital cities. There is also a very large informal economy consisting of cash-only street traders and vendors which are largely missed in official statistics. The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of [[water]] in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.

The container terminal at City Deep is purported to be the largest "dry port" in the world, with some 60 % of cargo that arrives through the port of [[Durban]] arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government, as part of the [[Blue IQ Project]].

Johannesburg's largest shopping centre is [[Sandton City]], while [[Hyde Park Corner (Shopping Centre)|Hyde Park]] is one of its most prestigious. Other centres include [[Rosebank]], [[Eastgate shopping centre, Johannesburg|Eastgate]], [[Westgate Shopping Centre|Westgate]], [[Northgate Shopping Centre, Johannesburg|Northgate]], [[Southgate Shopping Centre|Southgate]], and [[Cresta Shopping Centre|Cresta]]. There are also plans to build an extremely large shopping centre, known as the [[Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort]], in [[Midrand]]. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in [[isiZulu]], indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races.

== Communications and media ==
Several [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s have their offices in the city, as it is the transport and telecommunications centre for the country. ''[[Beeld]]'' is the leading [[Afrikaans]] newspaper for the city and the country, while the ''[[City Press]]'' is a Sunday newspaper that is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa. ''[[The Sowetan]]'' is a major newspaper that is published in [[Soweto]] township. The ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' is an investigative newspaper while ''[[The Citizen (newspaper, South Africa)|The Citizen]]'' is a [[tabloid]]-style paper, and ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' is a local newspaper that mostly covers [[Gauteng]]-related issues. The ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' is the most widely read Sunday newspaper.

Johannesburg is also a centre for broadcast media, with such radio stations as [[YFM]], Metro FM, 702, [[94.7 Highveld Stereo|Highveld Stereo]], [[5FM]], Kaya FM and Classic FM situated in the city. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of broadcasters [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[M-Net]], while [[Etv (South Africa)|eTV]] also has a presence in the city. The city has two [[television]] towers, the [[Hillbrow Tower]] and the [[Sentech Tower]].

== Suburbs ==
[[Image:Joburg.iss.400pix.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Johannesburg as seen from the [[International Space Station]].]]
:''Main article: [[Suburbs of Johannesburg]]''
The different suburbs of Johannesburg are generally categorised by compass direction, as different areas of the city have greatly different personalities. Since Johannesburg is such a large city, there is great variety in the suburbs that comprise it. While the [[Central Business District (Johannesburg)|Central Business District]] and the surrounding areas were formerly highly desired wealthy areas, they have lost their former reputation after migrants took over abandoned buildings, and the crime level rose accordingly. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly lower-class residential suburbs along with some [[Township (South Africa)|townships]], although most suburbs in the South tend to be extremely large and undistinguished.

The northern and northwestern suburbs have become the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops and well as several upper-class residential areas including [[Houghton, South Africa|Houghton]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] makes his home. The northwestern area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly-black suburb of [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] a hotbed of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured [[Melville, Gauteng|Melville]] featuring lively gathering places and nightlife. [[Auckland Park]] is home to the headquarters of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

To the southwest of the City Centre is [[Soweto]], a mostly black urban area constructed during the apartheid regime specifically for housing African people who were then living in areas designated by the government for white settlement. Today, Soweto is among the poorest parts of Johannesburg. The eastern suburbs include [[Yeoville, Gauteng|Yeoville]], a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation, and several residential areas that are slowly gaining respectability.

== Tourism ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Johannesburg Apartheid Museum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The exterior of the [[Apartheid Museum]] located on the grounds of [[Gold Reef City]].]] -->
Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], and the [[Kruger National Park]]. Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of more attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred around [[History of South Africa|history]] [[museums]], such as the [[Apartheid Museum]] and the [[Hector Pieterson Museum]]. [[Gold Reef City]], a large [[amusement park]] to the south of the Central Business District, is also a large draw for tourists in the city. The [[Johannesburg Zoo]] is also one of the largest in South Africa.

The city also has several [[art]] museums, such as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The [[Museum Africa]] covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of [[rock art]]. The [[Market Theatre]] complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays, and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting.

There is also a large industry around visiting former [[township (South Africa)|townships]], such as [[Soweto]] and [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]]. Most visitors to Soweto go to see the [[Mandela Museum]], which is located in the former home of [[Nelson Mandela]].

The [http://www.cradleofhumankind.co.za Cradle of Humankind] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] is 25 kilometres to the northwest of the city. The [[Sterkfontein]] [[fossil]] site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' and the first near-complete skeleton of an early ''[[Australopithecine]]''.

== Sports teams and stadiums ==
[[Image:Ellis Park Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ellis Park Stadium]], the host of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].]]
{{Johannesburg sports}}
Johannesburg<U+2019>s most popular sports by participation are [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[running]], [[rugby union|rugby]], and [[cricket]]. The [[Lions (rugby franchise)|Lions]], formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, [[North West (South African province)|North West]] and [[Mpumalanga]] in the Southern Hemisphere's [[Super 14]] Rugby Competition, which includes teams from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Johannesburg is also the home of the [[Golden Lions]], who play at [[Ellis Park Stadium]] and compete in the [[Currie Cup]]. 

Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs. People from Johannesburg are football mad and [[football club|clubs]] from Johannesburg either play in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL) or the [[SAFA First Division|First Division]]. In the PSL, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include [[Kaizer Chiefs Football Club|Kaizer Chiefs]] (also known as the ''Amakhosi''), [[Orlando Pirates Football Club|Orlando Pirates]] (also known as the ''Buccaneers'') and [[Moroka Swallows Football Club|Moroka Swallows]], based at the city's [[Ellis Park Stadium|Johannesburg]], [[Rand Stadium|Rand]], and [[FNB Stadium|FNB stadiums]] respectively. [[Wits University Football Club|Witwatersrand University]], nicknamed the ''Clever Boys'', who have a player membership of over 1,500, one of the world's largest are also part of the premier league. First Division teams include [[Katlehong City]] and [[Alexander United]], who play at [[Alexander Stadium|Alexander]] and [[Reiger Park Stadium|Reiger Park stadiums]] respectively

In cricket, the [[Highveld Lions]] represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West Province at the [[Wanderers Stadium]]. They take part in the [[Supersport Series|Supersport]] and [[MTN Domestic Championship]]. Johannesburg will also be the location of several matches in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which is to be held in South Africa.

[[Image:N1rainysouthbound.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rainy drive on the N1.]]
Johannesburg, much like [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], is a young and sprawling city geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.

;Mass transit
Johannesburg's [[Metrorail (South Africa)|metro railway]] system connects central Johannesburg to [[Soweto]], [[Pretoria]], and most of the satellite towns along the [[Witwatersrand]]. The railways transport huge numbers of workers every day.  However, the railway infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. In the past half century Johannesburg has grown largely northwards, and none of the northern areas, including the key business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], have any rail infrastructure.

The Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]], however, has made provisions for the creation of a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and east-west between Sandton and [[Johannesburg International Airport]]. Slated to be ready in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the rail system is being designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 160,000 per day.

;Airports
Johannesburg is served by [[OR Tambo International Airport]] (formerly '''Johannesburg International Airport''') for both domestic and international flights. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]], [[Grand Central Airport]], and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]]. Rand Airport, located in [[Germiston, Gauteng|Germiston]], is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of [[South African Airways]]'s first [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747 Classic]], the Lebombo, which is now an [[aviation]] [[museum]]. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft. Lanseria Airport is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Botswana]], and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]].

;Buses
Johannesburg is served by a [[bus]] fleet operated by [http://www.mbus.co.za/ Metrobus], a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum.  Metrobus also operates a number of open-top buses in the "City Slicker" role, using them to provide guided tours around the city.  In addition there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups.

;Taxis
Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s.  Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination.  Metered taxis are rare, in comparison to many other cities.

The minibus "taxis" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Although essential, these taxis are often of a poor standard in not only road-worthiness, but also in terms of driver quality with a majority of taxi drivers breaking traffic laws regularly (such as driving in the emergency lane while speeding on a highway). With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often over-filled with passengers causing yet another hazard for road users. However, without subsidies from Government and a lack of other feasible public transport, minibus taxis will remain an essential form of transport for many of Joburg's working class.

;Freeways
:''Main article: [[Johannesburg freeways]]''

The fact that Johannesburg is not built near a large navigable body of water has meant that from the very beginning of the city's history, ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city.  One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is comprised of three [[freeway]]s that converge on the city, forming an 80-kilometre loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Durban]]; the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Pretoria]] and [[Cape Town]]; and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]], which links Johannesburg with [[Witbank]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. The [[N3 (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa|N12]] and [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with [[concrete]], hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas (6 lanes in either direction), the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is purported to be the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.

;Trains

Construction of the [[Gautrain]] Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and will be completed by 2010, in time for the FIFA World Cup. It will comprise of a number of underground stations, as well as above ground stations.  It will run from Johannesburg's Park Station, through Rosebank, Sandton, Midrand and into Pretoria.  There will also be a line from the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] traveling to Sandton.  This will be the first new railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.

== Universities in Johannesburg ==
Johannesburg has a well-developed [[higher education]] system of both [[private university|private]] and [[public university|public universities]]. Johannesburg is served by the public universities [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and the [[University of Johannesburg]].

[[University of Johannesburg]] was formed on [[1 January]] [[2005]] when three separate universities and campuses<U+2014>[[Rand Afrikaans University]], [[Technikon Witwatersrand]], and [[Vista University]]<U+2014>were merged together. The new university offers education primarily in [[English language|English]] and [[Afrikaans]], although courses may be taken in any of South Africa's official languages.

The [[University of the Witwatersrand]] is one of the leading universities in South Africa, and is famous as a centre of resistance to [[apartheid]], earning it the nickname "Moscow on the Hill".

Private universities include [[Monash University]], which has one of its eight campuses in Johannesburg (six of the other campuses are in [[Australia]], while the eighth is in [[Malaysia]]), and [[Midrand Graduate Institute]] which is located in Midrand.
