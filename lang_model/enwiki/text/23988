It shares maritime boundaries with other nations including [[Barbados]] to the northeast, [[Guyana]] to the southeast, and [[Venezuela]] to the south and west.<ref>{{cite web| title = Treaty between the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the Republic of Venezuela on the delimitation of marine and submarine areas, 18 April 1990|publisher = The [[United Nations]]|url = http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/TTO-VEN1990ShA.PDF|accessdate =2009-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = The 1990 Accord Replaces the 1942 Paris Treaty|publisher = Trinidad and Tobago News|url=http://www.trinidadandtobagonews.com/selfnews/viewnews.cgi?newsid1083159999,34015,.shtml|accessdate =2009-04-13}}</ref>

Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the main islands; Tobago is much smaller, comprising about 6% of the total area and 4% of the entire population which is estimated at 1.3 million (2005). The nation lies outside the [[hurricane belt]]. 

Trinidad and Tobago was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colony]] from the times of [[Christopher Columbus]] to 1802, when it was ceded to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The country obtained independence in 1962. Unlike most of the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago's economy is primarily industrial,<ref>{{cite web| title = Trinidad and Tobago Country brief|publisher = The World Bank|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/TRINIDADANDTOBAGOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21045974~menuPK:331460~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:331452,00.html|accessdate = September 2008}}</ref>  with an emphasis on [[petroleum]] and [[petrochemical]]s. Trinidad and Tobago has a sound macroeconomic framework and a long tradition of institutional stability. It scores relatively well in many of the 10 economic freedoms, and its economy has grown at an average rate of close to 7 percent over the past five years. The government has tried to diversify the economic base, and the country has evolved into a key financial center in the Caribbean region.

Trinidad and Tobago is known for its [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival|Carnival]] and is the birthplace of [[steelpan]], [[calypso music|calypso]], [[soca music|soca]], and [[limbo (dance)|limbo]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Trinidad and Tobago}}
Historian E.L. Joseph claimed that Trinidad<U+2019>s Amerindian name was Iere, derived from the [[Arawak]] name for hummingbird, ''ier<U+00E8>tt<U+00EA>'' or ''yerett<U+00EA>''. However, Boomert claims that neither ''cairi'' nor ''caeri'' means hummingbird and ''tukusi'' or ''tucuchi'' does. Others have reported that ''kairi'' and ''iere'' simply mean ''island''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Christopher Columbus]] renamed it "La Ysla de la Trinidad" ("The Island of the Trinity"), fulfilling a vow he had made before setting out on his third voyage of exploration.<ref name="Hart, Marie 1965 p. 13">Hart, Marie. (1965). ''The New Trinidad and Tobago'', p. 13. Collins. London and Glasgow. Reprint 1972.</ref> 

Tobago's cigar-like shape may have given it its Spanish name (''cabaco'', ''tavaco'', ''tobacco'') and possibly its Amerindian names of Alouba<U+00E9>ra (black conch) and Urupaina (big snail) (Boomert, 2000), although the English pronunciation is {{IPA|/t<U+0259><U+02C8>be<U+026A><U+0261>o<U+028A>/}}, rhyming with ''plumbago'' and ''sago''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Trinidad===
Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by [[Amerindian]]s of South American origin. Trinidad was first settled by pre-agricultural Archaic people at least 7,000 years ago, making it the earliest-settled part of the Caribbean. Ceramic-using agriculturalists settled Trinidad around 250 BC and then moved further up the Lesser Antillean chain. At the time of [[Europe]]an contact Trinidad was occupied by various [[Amerindian languages|Arawakan]]-speaking groups including the Nepoya and Suppoya, and [[Cariban languages|Cariban]]-speaking groups such as the Yao, while Tobago was occupied by the [[Carib|Island Caribs]] and [[Galibi]].

[[Image:TobagoBeach5.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Store Bay in [[Tobago]], one of the top tourist destinations in the country]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] encountered the island of Trinidad on 31 July 1498. [[Antonio de Sede<U+00F1>o]] first settled Trinidad in the 1530s as a means of controlling the Orinoco and subduing the Warao (Whitehead, 1997). Cacique Wannawanare (Guanaguanare) granted the St Joseph area to Domingo de Vera e Ibarg<U+00FC>en in 1592 and then withdrew to another part of the island (Boomert, 2000). San Jos<U+00E9> de Oru<U+00F1>a (St Joseph) was established by Antonio de Berr<U+00ED>o on this land. [[Walter Raleigh]] arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 and soon attacked San Jos<U+00E9> and captured and interrogated de Berr<U+00ED>o obtaining much information from him and from the cacique Topiawari (Whitehead, 1997). 

In the 1700s, Trinidad belonged as an island province to the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] along with Central America, present-day Mexico and Southwestern United States (Besson, 2000). However Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with their handful of slaves and a few thousand Amerindians (Besson, 2000). Spanish colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous. Because Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a C<U+00E9>dula de Poblaci<U+00F3>n from the Spanish King Charles III on 4 November 1783. 

This C<U+00E9>dula de Poblaci<U+00F3>n was more generous than the first of 1776 and granted free lands to Roman Catholic foreign settlers and their slaves in Trinidad willing to swear allegiance to the Spanish king. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}The land grant was thirty two acres for each man, woman and child and half of that for each slave brought. As a result, Scots, Irish, German, Italian and English families arrived. Protestants benefited from Governor Don Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Chacon's generous interpretation of the law. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The [[French Revolution]] (1789) also had an impact on Trinidad's culture as it resulted in the emigration of [[Martinique|Martiniquan]] planters and their slaves to Trinidad who established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa) for the island.<ref>Besson, 2000</ref> 

The population of [[Port of Spain]] increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in five years and the inhabitants in 1797 consisted of people of mixed race, Spaniards, Africans, French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility (Besson, 2000). The total population of Trinidad in 1797 was 17,718; 2,151 of which were of European ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were slaves and 1,082 Amerindians. 

In 1797, [[Ralph Abercromby|General Sir Ralph Abercromby]] and his squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]]. The Spanish Governor Chacon decided to capitulate without fighting. Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws (Besson, 2000). The conquest and formal ceding of Trinidad in 1802 led to an influx of settlers from England or the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. The sparse settlement and slow rate of population increase during Spanish rule and even after British rule made Trinidad one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies with the least developed plantation infrastructure.<ref>(Brereton 1981)</ref>  Under British rule new estates were created and slave importation increased to facilitate development of the land into highly profitable sugar-cane estates, but mass importation of slaves was still limited and hindered, arguably, by abolitionist efforts in Britain,<ref name="Brereton, Bridget 1981">Brereton, Bridget(1981). A History of Modern Trinidad 1783-1962. London: Heinemann Educational Books</ref><ref name="Williams, Eric 1962">Williams, Eric (1962). History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago. London : Andre Deutsch.</ref>

The Abolitionist movement <ref name="Brereton, Bridget 1981"/> and/or the decreased economic viability of slavery as a means of procuring labour <ref name="Williams, Eric 1962"/> both resulted in the abolition of slavery in 1833 via Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (citation 3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73), which was followed by its substitution by an "apprenticeship" period. This was also abolished in 1838 with full emancipation being granted on August 1. An overview of the populations statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad and its neighbouring islands: upon Emancipation of the slaves in 1838, Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having less than 10 slaves each (pgs. 84<U+2013>85)<ref name="Williams, Eric 1962"/>

In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad, Jamaica had roughly 360,000 slaves.<ref>Meighoo, Kirk(2008)'Ethnic Mobilisation vs. Ethnic Politics: Understanding Ethnicity in Trinidad and Tobago Politics',Commonwealth & Comparative Politics,46:1,101<U+2013>127</ref>  Upon Emancipation, therefore, the incipient plantation owners were in severe need of labour, and the British filled this need by instituting a system of indenture. Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Chinese, Portuguese and Indians. Of these, the Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from May 1, 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first shipment to Trinidad on the Fatel Rozack, a Muslim-owned vessel <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinicenter.com/indian/indentureship.htm |title=1845: The Indians and indentureship |publisher=Trinicenter.com |date=1999-08-08 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, over which more than 147,000 Indians were brought to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.<ref>(Deen, Shamshu (1994). Solving East Indian Roots in Trinidad. Freeport Junction. H.E.M. Enterprise. (ISBN 9768136251)</ref>

They added what was initially the second largest population grouping to the young nation and their labour developed previously underdeveloped plantation lands. The Indenture contract was exploitative, such that historians Hugh Tinker were to call it "a new system of slavery". Persons were contracted for a period of five years with a daily wage (25 cents in the early 20th century) after which they were guaranteed return passage to India. Coercive means were often used to obtain labourers, however, and the indenture contracts were soon extended to 10 years after the planters complained that they were losing their labour too early <ref name="Brereton, Bridget 1981"/>

In lieu of the return passage the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement, however the numbers of people who did receive land grants is unclear.<ref>Tinker, Hugh (1991). A New System of Slavery: Export of Indian Labour Overseas (1830-1920). Hansib Publishing (Caribbean) Ltd.</ref>  Indians entering the colony were also subject to particular crown laws which segregated them from the rest of the Trinidad population, such as the requirement that they carry a "Pass" on their person once off the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their "Free Papers" or Certificate indicating completion of the indentureship period.<ref>Mohammed, Patricia (2002). Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad 1917-1947. Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>  Despite this, however, the ex-Indentureds came to constitute a vital and significant section of the population, as did the ex-slaves.

The cacao ([[cocoa bean|cocoa]]) crop also contributed greatly to the economic earnings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. After the collapse of the cacao crop (due to disease and the [[Great Depression]]) [[petroleum]] increasingly came to dominate the economy. The collapse of the sugar cane industry concomittant with the failure of the cocoa industry resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad and encouraged the rise of the Labour movement in the 1920 -1930 period. This was led by Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler, who, in combination with his Indian partners (notably Adrian Cola Rienzi) aimed to unite the working class and agricultural labouring class to achieve a better standard of living for all, as well as to hasten the departure of the British. This effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy themselves. They instigated a vicious race politicking in Trinidad which aimed at dividing the class-based movement on race-based lines, and they succeeded, especially since Butler's support collapsed from the top down. The Depression and the rise of the oil economy led to changes in the social structure. By the 1950s oil had become a staple in Trinidad's export market and was responsible for a growing middle-class among all sections of the Trinidad population.

===Tobago===
Columbus reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon, which he named ''Bellaforma'', but did not land on the island.<ref>Carmichael, Gertrude (1961). ''The History of the West Indian Islands of Trinidad and Tobago. 1498-1900'', p. 14. Alvin Redman, London.</ref> The name of Tobago is thought to probably be a corruption of its old name, "Tobaco".<ref name="Hart, Marie 1965 p. 13"/> 

[[File:TobagoBeach1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A beach near [[Crown Point, Tobago]]]]
The Dutch and the [[Kurzeme|Courlanders]] had established themselves in Tobago in the 16th and 17th centuries and produced tobacco and cotton. Tobago changed hands between [[British colonization of the Americas|British]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and [[Courland colonization of the Americas|Courlanders]] from modern-day [[Latvia]]. Britain consolidated its hold on both islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and they were combined into the [[colony]] of Trinidad and Tobago in 1889. 

As a result of these colonial struggles, Amerindian, Spanish, French and English [[List of cities in Trinidad and Tobago|place names]] are all common in the country. [[Africa]]n slaves and [[China|Chinese]], [[India]]n, and free African [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]], as well as [[Portugal|Portuguese]] from Madeira, arrived to supply labour in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Emigration from [[Barbados]] and the other Lesser Antilles, [[Venezuela]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]] also impacted on the ethnic make-up of the country.

===Independence===
[[Image:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|220px|Newly arrived indentured [[India]]ns in Trinidad]]
Trinidad and Tobago became an independent nation (from the [[United Kingdom]]) in 1962. The presence of [[United States|American]] [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|military bases]] in [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] and [[Cumuto]] in Trinidad during [[World War II]] profoundly changed the character of society. In the post-war period, the wave of [[decolonisation]] that swept the [[British Empire]] led to the formation of the [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958 as a vehicle for independence. Chaguaramas was the proposed site for the federal capital. The Federation dissolved after the withdrawal of [[Jamaica]] and the government chose to seek independence on its own.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1976, the country severed its links with the [[British monarchy]] and became a [[republic]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], though it retained the British Privy Council as its final Court of Appeal. Between the years 1972 and 1983, the Republic profited greatly from the rising price of [[oil]], as the oil-rich country increased its living standards greatly. In 1990, 114 members of the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]], led by [[Yasin Abu Bakr]], formerly known as Lennox Phillip, stormed the [[The Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|Red House]] (the seat of [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]]), and [[Trinidad and Tobago Television]], the only television station in the country at the time, and [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|held the country's government hostage for six days]] before surrendering.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Since 2003, the country has entered a second oil boom, a driving force which the government hopes to use to turn the country's main export back to sugar and [[agriculture]]. Great concern was raised in August 2007 when it was predicted that this boom would last only until 2018. Petroleum, petrochemicals and [[natural gas]] continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have begun to diversify and the island.<ref>[http://www.discovertnt.com/articles/Tobago/Business-Branches-Out/247/4/13 "Business Branches Out" ''(Discover Trinidad & Tobago)'']</ref> The bulk of tourism visitor arrival on the islands are from Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[File:POS Redhouse.JPG|thumb|left|[[The Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|The Red House]]: Trinidad and Tobago's Parliament Chamber 2008 (undergoing renovations)]]
Trinidad and Tobago is a [[republic]] with a [[two-party system]] and a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliamentary system based on the [[Westminster System]]. The [[head of state]] of Trinidad and Tobago is the [[President of Trinidad and Tobago|President]], currently [[George Maxwell Richards]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago|Prime Minister]] [[Patrick Manning]]. The President is elected by an [[Electoral college|Electoral College]] consisting of the full membership of both houses of [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]]. The [[Prime Minister]] is elected from the results of a general election which takes place every five years. 

The President is required to appoint the leader of the party who in his opinion has the most support of the members of the House of Representatives to this post; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the previous election (except in the case of the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 2001|2001 General Elections]]).
Tobago also has its own elections, separate from the general elections. In these elections, members are elected and serve in the Tobago House of Assembly.

The [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]] consists of two chambers, the [[Senate of Trinidad and Tobago|Senate]] (31 seats) and the [[House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|House of Representatives]] (41 seats).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=161209317 |title=Trinidad News |publisher=Trinidadexpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> The members of the Senate are appointed by the president. Sixteen Government Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, six Opposition Senators are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and nine Independent Senators are appointed by the President to represent other sectors of civil society. The 41 members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people for a maximum term of five years in a "[[plurality voting system|first past the post]]" system.

Since 24 December 2001, the governing party has been the [[People's National Movement]] led by [[Patrick Manning]]; the [[Parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] party is the [[United National Congress]] led by [[Basdeo Panday]]. Another recent party is the [[Congress of the People (Trinidad and Tobago)|Congress of the People]], or COP, led by [[Winston Dookeran]]. Support for these parties appears to fall along ethnic lines with the PNM consistently obtaining a majority Afro-Trinidadian vote, and the UNC gaining a majority of Indo-Trinidadian support. COP gained 23% of the vote but failed to win a single seat. At present the PNM holds 26 seats in the House of Representatives and the UNC Alliance (UNC-A) holds 15 seats, following elections held on 5 November 2007.

There are 14 municipal corporations (two cities, three boroughs, and nine Regions) which have a limited level of autonomy.  The various councils are made up of a mixture of elected and appointed members. Elections are due to be held every 3 years, but have not been held since 2003, 4 extensions having been sought by the government. Local Government elections are next due in July 2010.

Trinidad and Tobago is a leading member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), of which only the Caribbean Single Market (CSM) is in force. It is also the seat of the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which was inaugurated on 16 April 2005. The CCJ is intended to replace the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the final Appellate Court for the member states of the CARICOM. Since its inauguration, only two states, Barbados and Guyana, have acceded to the appellate jurisdiction of the CCJ.  The CCJ also serves as an original jurisdiction in the interpretation of the [[treaty of Chaguaramas|Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas]], to which all members of CARICOM have acceded.

After just three and a half years, Prime Minister Patrick Manning dissolved Parliament in April 2010, and the country is preparing for a general election which will take place on May 24, 2010.

===Administrative divisions===
Trinidad and Tobago is split into [[Regional Corporations and Municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago|Regional Corporations and Municipalities]]. The island of Tobago is governed by the [[Tobago House of Assembly]], and there are 9 corporations and 5 municipalities in the island of Trinidad:

It consists of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Regiment|Regiment]], the [[Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Air Force of Trinidad and Tobago|Air Guard]] and the [[Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force#Defence Force Reserves|Defence Force Reserves]]. Established in 1962 after Trinidad and Tobago's independence from [[Great Britain|Britain]], the TTDF is one of the largest Military forces in the English speaking [[Caribbean]]. 

Its mission statement is to ''"defend the sovereign good of The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, contribute to the development of the national community and support the State in the fulfillment of its national and international objectives"''. The Defence Force has been engaged in Domestic incidents, such as the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|1990 Coup Attempt]], and International missions, such as the [[United Nations Mission in Haiti]] between 1993 and 1996.

==Geography==
[[Image:Mayaro Beach; Trinidad & Tobago.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Mayaro]] Beach in the south-eastern area of Trinidad]]
{{Main|Geography of Trinidad and Tobago}}

Trinidad and Tobago are southeasterly islands of the [[Antilles]], situated between 10<U+00B0> 2' and 11<U+00B0> 12' N [[latitude]] and 60<U+00B0> 30' and 61<U+00B0> 56' W [[longitude]]. At the closest point, Trinidad is just {{convert|11|km}} off the [[Venezuela]]n coast. Covering an area of {{convert|5128|km<U+00B2>|abbr=on}}, the country consists of the two main islands, [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]], and [[List of islands of Trinidad and Tobago|numerous smaller landforms]] <U+2013> including [[Chacachacare]], [[Monos]], [[Huevos]], [[Gaspar Grande]] (or Gasparee), [[Little Tobago]], and [[Saint Giles Island|St. Giles Island]].  Trinidad is {{convert|4768|km<U+00B2>|abbr=on}} in area (comprising 93.0% of the country's total area) with an average length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} and an average width of {{convert|59|km}}. 

Tobago has an area of about {{convert|300|km<U+00B2>|abbr=on}}, or 5.8% of the country's area, is {{convert|41|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} at its greatest width. Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America. However the Caribbean islands are generally considered to be part of [[North America]], and as the language and cultural links of Trinidad and Tobago are not to South America but to the rest of the English speaking Caribbean nations, the nation is often treated as part of North America.

[[Image:Port of spain hills.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Hillside along [[Diego Martin]]]]

The terrain of the islands is a mixture of mountains and plains. The highest point in the country is found on the [[Northern Range]] at [[El Cerro del Aripo]] which is {{convert|940|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The climate is tropical. There are two seasons annually: the [[dry season]] for the first six months of the year, and the [[wet season]] in the second half of the year. Winds are predominantly from the northeast and are dominated by the [[Ordinal direction|northeast]] [[trade wind]]s. Unlike most of the other Caribbean islands, both Trinidad and Tobago have frequently escaped the wrath of major devastating hurricanes including [[Hurricane Ivan]], the most powerful storm to pass close to the islands in recent history in September 2004.

As the majority of the population live in Trinidad, this is the location of most major towns and cities. There are three major municipalities in Trinidad: [[Port of Spain]], the capital, [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], and [[Chaguanas]]. The main town in Tobago is [[Scarborough, Tobago|Scarborough]]. Trinidad is made up of a variety of soil types, the majority being fine sands and heavy clays. The alluvial valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the ''[[East-West Corridor]]'' are the most fertile. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Image:Chaconia UWI 2005b.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Chaconia ''([[Warszewiczia coccinea]])'' is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago.]]

The Northern Range consists mainly of Upper [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] metamorphic rocks. The Northern Lowlands ([[East-West Corridor]] and Caroni Plains) consist of younger shallow marine clastic sediments. South of this, the [[Central Range, Trinidad|Central Range]] fold and thrust belt consisits of Cretaceous and [[Eocene]] sedimentary rocks, with [[Miocene]] formations along the southern and eastern flanks. The [[Naparima Plains]] and the [[Nariva Swamp]] form the southern shoulder of this uplift. 

The Southern Lowlands consist of Miocene and [[Pliocene]] sands, clays, and gravels. These overlie [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] deposits, especially north of the Los Bajos Fault. The Southern Range forms the third anticlinal uplift. It consists of several chains of hills, most famous being the [[Trinity Hills]]. The rocks consist of [[sandstone]]s, [[shale]]s and [[siltstone]]s and clays formed in the Miocene and uplifted in the Pleistocene. [[tar sands|Oil sands]] and [[mud volcano]]es are especially common in this area.

Although it is located just off-shore from South America, Trinidad and Tobago is generally included as part of the [[West Indies]] by virtue of its geographical and historical heritage in the Caribbean.

[[Image:refinerypointeapierre.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The oil refinery at [[Pointe-<U+00E0>-Pierre]]]]

Trinidad's economy is strongly influenced by the petroleum industry. Tourism and manufacturing are also important to the local economy.Tourism is a growing sector, although not proportionately as important as in many other Caribbean islands. Agricultural products include citrus, cocoa, and other products.

Recent growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminum, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food and beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region. 

Oil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. The country is also a regional financial center, and the economy has a growing trade surplus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35638.htm |title=U.S. State Department |publisher=State.gov |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> The expansion of Atlantic LNG over the past six years created the largest-single sustained phase of economic growth in Trinidad and Tobago. It has become the leading exporter of LNG to the United States, and now supplies some 70% of U.S. LNG imports.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Caribbean/LNG.html |title=US Energy Information Administration - LNG |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

Trinidad and Tobago has transitioned from an oil-based economy to a natural gas based economy. In 2007, natural gas production averaged 4&nbsp;billion standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d), compared with 3.2 bcf/d in 2005. In December 2005, the Atlantic LNG fourth production module or "train" for liquefied natural gas (LNG) began production. Train 4 has increased Atlantic LNG's overall output capacity by almost 50% and is the largest LNG train in the world at 5.2&nbsp;million tons/year of LNG.

Trinidad and Tobago's infrastructure is good by regional standards.{{Or|date=August 2009}} The [[Piarco International Airport|international airport]] in Trinidad was expanded in 2001. There is an extensive network of paved roads with several good four and six lane highways including one controlled access expressway. The Ministry of Works estimates that an average Trinidadian spend 4 hours in traffic per day. Emergency services are reliable, but may suffer delays in rural districts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Private hospitals are available and reliable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Utilities are fairly reliable in the cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Some areas, however, especially rural districts, still suffer from water shortages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Telephone service is relatively modern and reliable.{{Or|date=August 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Cellular service is widespread and has been the major area of growth for several years.  Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (generally known as TSTT) is the largest telephone and Internet service provider in Trinidad and Tobago. The company, which is jointly owned by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and Cable & Wireless, was formed out of a merger of Telco (Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Company Limited) and Textel (Trinidad and Tobago External Telecommunications Company Limited). TSTT no longer holds a monopoly in fixed-line telephone services due to Flow introducing a fixed-line service of their own, but their cellular monopoly was broken in June 2005 when licenses were granted to [[Digicel]] and [[Laqtel]]. Laqtel however never started business.

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Trinidad and Tobago}}
[[Image:CRHUBH intersection.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Intersection of Churchill Roosevelt Highway & Uriah Butler Highway 2009]]
Trinidad and Tobago has a transportation system with many components, including main roads, highways, freeways, ferries and water taxis, as well as public and private transportation. Located in Trinidad is the [[Piarco International Airport]], the country's major airport. A smaller number of international flights fly to Tobago's [[Crown Point International Airport]]. Public transportation options on land are public buses, private taxis and minibuses. By sea, the options are inter-island ferries and inter-city water taxis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.tt/index.php?news=863 |title=Government of Trinidad and Tobago Information Services press release on water taxis |publisher=News.gov.tt |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

===Airport===
The island of Trinidad is served by [[Piarco International Airport]] located in [[Piarco]]. It was opened on 8 January 1931. Elevated at 17.4 m above sea level it comprises an area of 680 hectares and has a runway of {{gaps|3|200|m}}. The airport consists of two terminals, the North Terminal and the South Terminal. The older South Terminal underwent renovations in 2009 for use as a VIP entrance point during the 5th [[Summit of the Americas]]. The North Terminal was completed in 2001, and consists of <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tntairports.com/piarco_about.html|title=Airport Authority of Trinidad and Tobago - Welcome to Piarco Airport}}</ref>  14 second-level aircraft gates with loading bridges from the aircraft to the terminal building for international flights, 2 ground level domestic gates and 82 ticket counter positions.

Piarco International Airport was voted the Caribbean<U+2019>s leading airport for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency at the prestigious World Travel Awards (WTA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelawards.com/|title=World Travel Awards}}</ref> held in the Turks and Caicos in 2006.<ref>{{cite web

As of December 2006, nineteen international airlines operated out of Piarco and offered flights to twenty-seven international destinations.

===Airline===
[[Caribbean Airlines]] is the national airline of Trinidad and Tobago, with its main hub at the Piarco International Airport in Trinidad. It operates international services from the Caribbean to the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, South America, and other Caribbean islands. The airline which is wholly owned by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, began operations on 1 January 2007, to replace its predecessor, BWIA or British West Indies Airways. After an additional cash injection of US$50 million, the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] government acquired the Jamaican airline [[Air Jamaica]] on 1 May, 2010, with a 6-12 month transition period to follow.<ref>[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100429/lead/lead1.html "Caribbean Airlines to re-hire 1,000 workers" by Daraine Luton, ''The Jamaica Gleaner'', 29 April 2010]</ref>

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Trinidad and Tobago}}

As of 2005, most (96%) of the country's 1.3&nbsp;million inhabitants reside on the island of Trinidad with most of the remainder (4%) in Tobago. The ethnic composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration. Two major ethnic groups, [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]]s and [[Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]]s, account for almost 80% of the population, while people of [[multiracial|mixed race]], [[European ethnic groups|European]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Greater Syria|Syrian]]<U+2013>[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent make up most of the rest of the population.

===Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians===
[[Image:TempleHinduinTT.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The 26 m (85 ft) Hanuman Murti statue and [[Hindu|Hindu Temple]] in Central Trinidad 2008. This monument is also the largest Hanuman Murti statue outside of [[India]]]]
Indo-Trinidadians make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 40%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/trinidad_and_tobago/demographics_profile.html |title=Demographic Data |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>). They are primarily descendants from indentured workers from [[India]], brought to replace freed African slaves who refused to continue working on the sugar plantations. The Indian community is divided roughly half-and-half between those who maintained their original, native [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]] religions and those who have taken to Christianity or have no religious affiliation. Through cultural preservation groups, Trinidadians of Indian descent maintain many of their customs and rites.

===Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonians===
[[Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]] make up the country's second largest ethnic group (approximately 37.5%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/trinidad_and_tobago/demographics_profile.html |title=2000 Census information |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>). The majority are descendants of the Colonial slave laborers who were brought in the last few years of Trinidad's Spanish Colonial era, and the beginning of the English colonial period. 
The experience of slavery in Trinidad was limited in that the island was very sparsely populated. The [[Cedula of Population]] transformed a small colony of 1000 in 1773 to 18,627 by 1797. 

In the census of 1777 there were only 2,763 people recorded as living on the island, including some 2,000 Arawaks. During this time there were many African slave owners. In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] that abolished the trading of slaves, and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] abolished the practice of slavery.

===Europeans===
The European population is primarily descended from early settlers and immigrants. About half are of [[British people|British]] origin, and the remainder are of [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and [[German people|German]] heritage. The recent census counted 11,000 of British, 4,100 Spanish, 4,000 French, 2,700 Portuguese and 2,700 German descent. These numbers do not include people who have at least some European ancestry but self-identify as African or Indian. They may be descended from settlers from [[Spain]], or from mixed-raced immigrants from [[Venezuela]], commonly referred to as "[[Cocoa Panyol]]s". 

The French arrived mostly during the Spanish period to take advantage of free agricultural lands. The Portuguese were brought to replace freed African slaves when they refused to accept low wages. The Europeans who remain in Trinidad do so in the areas in and around [[Port of Spain]]. In [[Tobago]], most Europeans are retirees from Germany and Scandinavia.

===Mixed race===
Given the large number of ethnic identities in Trinidad and Tobago many citizens have a mixed ethnic heritage.  Such racial mixtures can include Caucasian and African, [[mulattos]], and Indian and African, which is often colloquially known as [[dougla]]. Its mixed population is estimated at around 20%.

===Other ethnic groups===
There are groups of [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese]] who, like the Portuguese and Indians, are descended from indentured laborers. They account for about 20,000 people and live mostly in Port-of-Spain and San Fernando. There are also about 2,500 [[Arabs]], descending from [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] who live mostly in Port-of-Spain. The Syrian and Lebanese communities of Trinidad are predominantly Christian, migrating from the Middle East in the 19th century while fleeing religious persecution received from the [[Ottoman Empire]] later landing in the Caribbean and Latin America. Other Lebanese and Syrians came in the early to middle 20th century to escape the war and turmoil in the region. Finally there are the mixed raced [[Caribs]] who are descended from the native, precolonial people of the islands. They are organized around the [[Santa Rosa Carib Community]] and live mostly in and around [[Arima]].

===Emigration===
Emigration from Trinidad and Tobago, as with other Caribbean nations, has historically been high; most emigrants go to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[UK|Britain]]. Emigration has continued, albeit at a lower rate, even as the birth-rate sharply dropped to levels typical of industrialised countries. Largely because of this phenomenon, as of 2007, Trinidad and Tobago has been experiencing a low [[List of countries by population growth rate|population growth rate]] (0.37%).

{{Main|Religion in Trinidad and Tobago}}
Many different religions are present in Trinidad and Tobago. The largest two are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (26%) and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] (22.5%). The [[Anglican Church|Anglicans]] (7.8%), [[Islam|Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] (4%), Other Christians (5.8%) [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterians]], [[Kingdom Hall|Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Methodist Church|Methodists]] are among the other faith groups represented. 

Two [[African]] [[syncretic]] faiths, the [[Shouter Baptist|Shouter]] or [[Spiritual Baptist]]s and the [[Orisha]] faith (formerly called [[Shango]]s, a less than complimentary term) are among the fastest growing religious groups, as are a host of [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Fundamentalist Christian|fundamentalist]] churches usually lumped as "[[Pentecostal]]" by most Trinidadians (although this designation is often inaccurate). A small [[Judaism|Judaic]] community exists, as well as several other Eastern religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] are followed by the [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese community]].Other 10.8%, unspecified 1.4%, none 1.9% (2000 census)

==Language==
[[English language|English]] is the country's only official language, but the main spoken language is English [[dialect]] ([[Trinidadian English]] or [[Tobagonian Creole English]]) which reflects the Spanish, Indian, African and European heritage of the nation. Both creoles contain elements from a number and variety of African languages; [[Trinidadian English]], however, is also influenced by [[French language|French]], French Creole, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and by Bhojpuri/Hindi. The Spanish languages and other vernaculars are normally spoken in informal situations, and there is no formalized system of writing. Patois (a variety of [[Creole language|Spanish/ French]]) was once the most widely spoken language in Trinidad, and there are various remnants of the language in everyday vernacular. There was also a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-based [[creole language|creole]], known as "Coco Payol", a term also used to describe people of Spanish ancestry.

Due to Trinidad's location on the coast of [[South America]], the country has been slowly redeveloping a connection with the Spanish-speaking peoples but has been impeded by the fact that in 2004, only 45,500 inhabitants spoke Spanish. In 2004 the government initiated the "Spanish as a Foreign Language (SAFFL) Initiative"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeind.gov.tt/SIS/FAQ.htm |title=Secretariat for The Implementation of Spanish, Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago |publisher=Tradeind.gov.tt |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> with a public launch in March 2005. People from [[Venezuela]] travel to Trinidad and Tobago to learn English, and many English schools have expanded to feature both English and Spanish.

Because of the country's colonial heritage, the names of towns in Trinidad are derived in roughly equal proportions from English (Chatham, Brighton, Green Hill, St. Mary's, [[Princes Town]], Freeport, New Grant), French (Blanchisseuse, Sans Souci, Pointe-<U+00E0>-Pierre, Basse Terre, Matelot, Petit Bourg), Spanish (San Fernando, Sangre Grande, Rio Claro, San Juan, Las Cuevas, Maracas, Manzanilla, Los Bajos) Indian (Fyzabad, Barrackpore, Indian Walk, Madras Settlement, Penal, Debe) and Amerindian languages ([[Chaguanas]], [[Tunapuna]], [[Guayaguayare]], [[Carapichaima]], Mucurapo, [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], [[Arima]], [[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]], [[Guaico]], Oropouche, [[Aripo]]). In Tobago, English names predominate. However, there are several names which suggest its colonial past: Belle Garden, Bon Accord, Charlotteville, Les Coteaux, Parlatuvier (French), Auchenskeoch, Blenheim (Dutch), Great Courland Bay (the [[Courland]]ers).

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Trinidad and Tobago}}
Children generally start pre-school at the early age of 3 years. This level of tuition is not mandatory but most children start school at this stage as children are expected to have basic reading and writing skills when they commence primary school. Students proceed to a primary school at the age of 5 years. Seven years are spent in primary school. The seven classes of primary school consists of Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten, followed by Standard One through Standard Five.  During the final year of primary school, students prepare for and sit the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) which determines the secondary school the child will attend. 

Students attend secondary school for a minimum of five years, leading to the CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) examinations, which is the equivalent of the British GCSE O levels. Children with satisfactory grades may opt to continue high school for a further two year period, leading to the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE), the equivalent of GCE A levels. Both CSEC and CAPE examinations are held by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). Public Primary and Secondary education is free for all, although private and religious schooling is available for a fee. 

Tertiary education is also free for all, however, up to the level of the Bachelors degrees for all students of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), the [[University of Trinidad and Tobago]] (UTT), the [[University of the Southern Caribbean]] (USC) and certain other local accredited institutions.  Government also currently subsidises some Masters programmes. Both the Government and the private sector also provide financial assistance in the form of academic scholarships to gifted or needy students for study at local, regional or international universities.

Trinidad and Tobago claims two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning authors, [[V.S. Naipaul]] and [[Saint Lucia|St Lucian]]-born [[Derek Walcott]] (who founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop, working and raising a family in Trinidad for much of his career). [[Edmundo Ros]], the "King of Latin American Music", was born in Port of Spain. Designer [[Peter Minshall]] is renowned not only for his Carnival costumes, but also for his role in opening ceremonies of the [[Barcelona Olympics]], the [[1994 Football World Cup]], the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], for which he won an [[Emmy Award]].

[[Geoffrey Holder]], brother of [[Boscoe Holder]], and [[Heather Headley]] are also two Trinidad-born artists who have won [[Tony Awards]] for theatre. Holder also has a distinguished film career, and Headley has been nominated for several [[Grammy Awards]].
