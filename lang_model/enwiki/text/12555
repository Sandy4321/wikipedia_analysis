'''Nelson Wesley Trout''' (1921-1996) was the first U.S. Lutheran African American bishop in the [[ELCA]]. 

Trout was born in Columbus, Ohio, USA.

Trout was elected bishop of the South Pacific District of the [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC) in 1983, a position he served through 1987. At the time of his election he was a professor and director of minority studies at [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], Columbus, Ohio. He was renown as a moving and powerful preacher throughout the church. He served pastorates in Alabama (where he became a friend and colleague of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]), California and Wisconsin, and as Executive Director of Lutheran Social Services, Dayton, Ohio. On two occasions he served the ALC in executive capacities: as Associate Youth Director (1962-67) and Director of Urban Evangelism (1968-70). He died in 1996 at the age of 76. He is commemorated in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] on September 20.
