'''Cyrus Ballou Comstock''' (February 3, 1831 &ndash; May 29, 1910) was a career officer in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular]] Army of the United States.

After graduating the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1855, Comstock served with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].  At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], he assisted with the fortification of [[Washington, D.C.]].  In 1862, he was transferred to the field, eventually becoming chief engineer of the [[Army of the Potomac]].  In 1863 during the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], he served as the chief engineer of the [[Army of the Tennessee]].  The most significant phase of Comstock's career began in November 1864 when he was appointed to the staff of [[Lieutenant general (United States) | Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]], becoming Grant's senior [[aide-de-camp]].  In 1865, Comstock was appointed the senior engineer in the assault on [[Fort Fisher]], North Carolina and the assault on [[Mobile, Alabama]], both of which were successful.  By the end of the war, Comstock had been promoted to [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the Volunteer Army and brevet [[Brigadier general (United States) | brigadier general]] in the Regular Army.<ref name=Bowen>Bowen, 901 &ndash; 902.</ref>

After the close of the war, Comstock served on the military commission for the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].  He was dismissed from the commission for his criticism of the proceedings.<ref name=Chamlee223>Chamlee, 223.</ref>  Later, Comstock continued in the service of the Army Corps of Engineers and took part in several engineering projects, most particularly the [[Mississippi Valley Division|Mississippi River Commission]] of which he was president.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] to Nathan and Betsy Comstock on February 3, 1831, Cyrus Comstock attended the United States Military Academy at West Point.  He graduated first in his class in 1855.<ref name=Heidler>Heidler, 475 &ndash; 476.</ref>  Following his graduation, Comstock was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers and assisted with the design and construction of several fortifications.  He also served as an instructor of engineering at West Point.

==Civil War service==
At the commencement of the Civil War, Comstock, then holding the rank of [[First Lieutenant#United States | first lieutenant]] in the Regular Army was from West Point to Washington, D.C.  He became an assistant to Brig. Gen. [[John G. Barnard]], the engineer in charge of the fortifications of Washington and later chief engineer of the [[Army of the Potomac]].<ref name=Heidler/>

===Army of the Potomac===
When the Army of the Potomac took the field in the spring of 1862 during Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Peninsular Campaign]], Comstock continued to serve as Barnard's assistant.  On June 1, 1862, during the Peninsular Campaign, Comstock was appointed chief engineer of the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]].  He continued with the Army of the Potomac through the remainder of the Peninsular Campaign and through the [[Maryland Campaign]].<ref name=Eicher>Eicher, 181.</ref>

Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] succeeded McClellan and appointed Comstock the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac.  During the [[Fredericksburg Campaign]], Comstock was faced with the difficult task of constructing [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon bridges]] over the [[Rappahannock River]].  The arrival of the pontoon boats was greatly delayed and the [[Union Army|Union]] troops attempting to construct the bridges were completely exposed to enemy fire.  These factors made the task one of the most challenging of Comstock's career.<ref name=Heidler/>

When Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] reorganized the Army of the Potomac in the spring of 1863, Comstock was removed as chief engineer of that army and placed in command of a [[battalion]] of engineers.  In that capacity, he played an important role in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], overseeing the construction of pontoon bridges over various rivers which first allowed the advance of the Army of the Potomac and later facilitated its retreat after Union forces were defeated.<ref name=Heidler/>

===Siege of Vicksburg===
After the Battle of Chancellorsville, Comstock was transferred to the Army of the Tennessee which was, at that time, involved in the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], Mississippi under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses Grant.  Comstock arrived at Vicksburg in June 1863 and set to work on improving the siege works.<ref name=Heidler/>  His efforts earned Grant's respect.  Comstock was soon promoted to [[Major (United States) | major]] and appointed chief engineer of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref name=Bowen/>  The Siege of Vicksburg was successful, in part due to Comstock's supervision of the overall siege works, and the city surrendered to Union forces on July 4, 1863.  This victory marked a major turning point in the war as the Union Army gained control of the [[Mississippi River]].  The impression that Comstock made on Grant would have a significant impact on Comstock's career later in the war.

Comstock remained with the Army of the Tennessee into the fall of 1863.  On November 19, he became assistant [[Inspector General#United States| inspector general]] of the [[Department of the Mississippi]] and promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)| lieutenant colonel]] of volunteers.  He served in this role until March 1864.<ref name=Bowen/>

===General Grant's staff===

The [[National Archives and Records Administration|United States National Archives]] lists Brig. Gen. Cyrus Comstock as one of the officers in the photograph.]]On March 12, 1864, Grant was appointed [[Commanding General of the United States Army|general-in-chief]] of the United States Army and moved his headquarters to the eastern theater in Virginia.  Grant asked Comstock to come with him as his senior aide-de-camp.  Grant determined to command in the field, following and directing the movements of the Army of the Potomac in a major offensive during the summer of 1864 known as the [[Overland Campaign]].  During the campaign, Comstock played a key role in coordinating the movements of the various [[Corps|corps]] of the army and personally conveying Grant's orders to the corps commanders.<ref name=Heidler/>  His efforts were particularly successful during the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] for which Comstock won a commendation from Grant and a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army.<ref name=Heidler/>

Comstock was temporarily detached from Grant's staff and appointed by Grant to the post of chief engineer of the Department of North Carolina in January 1865.<ref name=Bowen/>  The transfer was prompted by Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]]'s failure to take [[Fort Fisher]] in December 1864.  The fort was the last Confederate stronghold on the east coast.  Serving under the command of Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]], Comstock assisted in planning a second and successful assault on Fort Fisher.  Following this victory, Comstock was promoted to brevet colonel in the Regular Army.<ref name=Bowen/>  He returned to Virginia and to his role as Grant's senior aide, but did not remain long.

In March 1865, Grant again dispatched Comstock to aid in a key siege operation&mdash;this time to Mobile, Alabama, the last Confederate stronghold on the Gulf of Mexico.  There Comstock served under Maj. Gen. [[Edward Canby]] and assisted in operations leading to the surrender of Mobile after the [[Battle of Spanish Fort]] and the [[Battle of Fort Blakely]] in April 1865.  While Comstock was serving in Alabama, Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to Grant after the [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse]], essentially ending the Civil War.  For his service in Alabama, Comstock was promoted to brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army and brevet major general in the Volunteer Army.<ref name=Bowen/>

==Post-war life==
===Military commission on the Lincoln assassination===
In May 1865, while still serving on Grant's staff, Comstock was called to serve as one of the nine military commissioners to oversee the trial of the conspirators in the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].  At first, Comstock was eager to see the prosecution of the conspirators, writing that, for them, "death is too good."<ref>Chamlee, 221.</ref>  However, as the trial proceeded, Comstock became disturbed by the secrecy of the military proceedings.  Concerned about the violation of the defendants' rights, he began to openly argue for the case to be transferred to a civilian court.  Comstock was removed from the commission after his protests, ostensibly because he served on Grant's staff and, because Grant had been a potential target of the conspirators, Comstock could not be counted on to act impartially.<ref name=Chamlee223/>

===Later work with the Corps of Engineers===
Comstock served on Grant's staff until 1866, then returned to service with the Corps of Engineers and remained on active duty until 1895.<ref name=Heidler/>  In the course of his post-war duty, he served with several boards and commissions including the Permanent Board of Engineers in New York City, the geodetic survey of the north and northwestern lakes of the United States, and was president for many years of the Mississippi River Commission.<ref name=loc>{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Biographical Note  | work = C.

Comstock was a prominent member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and bequeathed a fund to the Academy to support an award to a scientist conducting innovative work in the investigation of electricity, magnetism, or radiant energy.  Today known as the Comstock Prize in Physics, the award in the amount of $20,000 is granted every five years by the Academy.<ref>{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Academy Honors 16 for Major Contributions to Science  | work = News from the National Academies  | publisher = The National Academies  | date = January 16, 2004  | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=01162004 | accessdate = April 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Family===
In 1869, Comstock married Elizabeth Blair, daughter of [[Montgomery Blair]] who had served as [[United States Postmaster General]] during the Lincoln administration.<ref name=loc/>  They had a daughter, Elizabeth Marion Comstock, who was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1872 while Comstock was at work on the geodetic survey of the [[Great Lakes]].
