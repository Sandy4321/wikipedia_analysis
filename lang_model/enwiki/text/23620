'''Henry V (III) of Iron''' ({{lang-pl|'''Henryk V <U+017B>elazny'''}}; b. ca. 1319 - d. aft. 8 April 1369), was a Duke of [[<U+017B>aga<U+0144>]] since 1342, from 1349 Duke of half-[[G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w]], and from 1363 Duke of half-[[<U+015A>cinawa]].

He was the only son of [[Henry IV the Faithful|Henry IV (II) the Faithful]], Duke of [[<U+017B>aga<U+0144>]], by his wife Matilda, daughter of [[Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel]].

==Life==
The young Henry V gained his political experience at the side of his father, taking part in negotiations with his [[Jan of <U+015A>cinawa]] in 1341, who give [[Wschowa]] to them. A year later, the death of his father made Henry V the new ruler of <U+017B>aga<U+0144>.

He was nicknamed "of Iron" (''<U+017B>elazny'') for the consistency and ruthlessness of his acts. Immediately after he took control over the government, Henry V oriented his politics in recover the lost lands during his late father's rule.

In 1343 Henry V refused to pay tribute to Bohemia and tried to recover [[G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w]], which was occupied by King [[John of Bohemia]] after the death of his uncle [[Przemko II of G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w|Przemko II]] in 1331. At the same time, King [[Casimir III the Great]] of [[Poland]] using the confusion reigned in Silesia to take [[Wschowa]]. In the subsequent conflict and supported his uncles [[Konrad I of Ole<U+015B>nica]] and Jan of <U+015A>cinawa, Henry V could forced the retreat of the Polish troops under the walls of [[<U+015A>cinawa]]. However, thanks to the losses among Konrad I's army, the Polish King could retain the last Greater Poland land in the hands of [[Henry III, Duke of Silesia-Glogau|Henry III]]'s descendants.

Although his defeat wasn't to serious, Henry V sent a message to Casimir III the Great, asking  for peace. The Polish troops leave [[<U+017B>aga<U+0144>]], and was performed a meeting between the King and Henry V. Casimir III treated him with honors and leave him all the lands who he could occupied during the conflict, except Wschowa.

The conflict with the Polish King prevented Henry V to developed a more strong resistance against King John of Bohemia. An agreement was finally made on 7 June 1344, under which King John give Henry V half of the Duchy of [[G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w]] (however, he only could take formal possession of the land in 1349); in exchange, the Duke of <U+017B>aga<U+0144> was forced to declared himself a vassal of Bohemia and paid tribute to King John. The ceremony took place on 23 November of that year in [[Prague]].

The events of 1344 involucred Henry V in the Bohemian politics, and a year later, when war broke out between [[Silesia]] and Bohemia, the Duke of <U+017B>aga<U+0144> supported his sovereign with troops while he tried to recover Wschowa.

As a vassal of Bohemia, Henry V also participated in many ceremonies and diplomatic activities on behalf of King John and later his son and successor, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], for example in Charles's coronation on 1 September 1347 in Prague, two years later when he joined to the King's suite in a trip to [[Avignon]] and [[Aachen]], and finally in 1355 when he travel to [[Italy]] and witnessed the King's imperial coronation in [[Rome]].

The Duke of <U+017B>aga<U+0144>'s faithful service had his reward in 1351, when, after the death of [[Boles<U+0142>aw III of P<U+0142>ock]] (Henry V's brother-in-law) without issue (and according to the 1329 treaty signed between King John of Bohemia and Duke [[Wenceslaus of P<U+0142>ock]]), the Emperor enfeoffed him with his Duchy. However, the quick actions of King Casimir III the Great, who immediately after Boles<U+0142>aw III's death took control over P<U+0142>ock, prevented Henry V to obtain this land.

In 1356, together with [[Nicholas the Small]], Duke of [[Zi<U+0119>bice]], Henry V was involved in a diplomatic mission to [[Constantinople]], where he took part in the pilgrimage to [[Palestine]].

Upon his return Henry V extend his possessions. He purchased (mostly to Jan of <U+015A>cinawa) the towns of [[Nowogr<U+00F3>d Bobrza<U+0144>ski]], [[Rycze<U+0144>]], half of [[<U+015A>cinawa]], and the area between the [[Odra River]] and [[Barycz]] called Mi<U+0119>dzyrzecze. Another success was the purchase of the half of [[G<U+00F3>ra]] after Jan's death by 1365. Shortly after, Henry V paid the sum of 600 fine silver to his only surviving uncle, Konrad I of Ole<U+015B>nica, for his rights over that lands.

In 1360 the relations between Henry V and Emperor Charles IV began to deteriorated. One of the reasons was that the Emperor, who decided to restitute to [[Przemko II of G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w|Przemko II]]'s widow the other half of G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w as her long-time waited ''Oprawa wdowia'', but giving the promise of inheritance over [[Bolko II the Small]], Duke of [[<U+015A>widnica]]. With this action, Henry V lose all his hopes of restoring the unity of G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w. Soon, he began to visit [[Krakow]] and made an alliance with the King Casimir III the Great. In order to become more strong this bond, was arranged a political marriage between the Henry V's daughter Hedwig and King Casimir III. With this union, the Polish King increased his influence over [[Silesia]], and the Duke of <U+017B>aga<U+0144> gained an ally and protector. The wedding took place on 25 February 1363 in [[Wschowa]] and was performed by the [[Bishop of Pozna<U+0144>]], [[Jan V of Lutogniewo]].

Henry V was regarded as a good host, although he famous for his excessive severity with his subjects. He didn't made any differences between the Church or the aristocracy when he had to made justice. Particularly embarrassing were his continuous disputes with the [[Augustinian]] Order of <U+017B>aga<U+0144>. His rule was too harsh that he had to face the fury of his own vassals, who even kidnapped him, but shortly after released him in the basement of St. Jakob's Church in G<U+0142>og<U+00F3>w.

In 1367 as a result of an inflammation in his eyes, Henry V became blind. He died of pneumonia two years later and was buried in the Augustinian church in <U+017B>aga<U+0144>.

==Marriage and issue==
