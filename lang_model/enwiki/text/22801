'''No. 2 Squadron''' is a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadron that currently operates from [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], near [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. From its formation in 1916 as part of the [[Australian Flying Corps]], the squadron has operated a variety of aircraft types including [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[Airborne Early Warning & Control]] (AEW&C). During World War I, the squadron operated on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions. It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities. The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937. It saw action as a bomber squadron in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]], and in later conflicts including the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]]. The squadron is currently equipped with the [[Boeing 737 AEW&C]] "Wedgetail".

==History==
===World War I===
On 20 September 1916, No. 2 Squadron was established as a unit of the [[Australian Flying Corps]]  (AFC) at [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya|Kantara, Egypt]],{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=10}} drawing personnel mainly from [[Australian Light Horse]] units of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF). Shortly after forming, under the command of Major [[Oswald Watt]], the unit was transferred to the United Kingdom to complete training, arriving at [[RAF Harlaxton|Harlaxton]] on 30 January 1917.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=14}}  Between February and September 1917, the squadron undertook training with [[Royal Flying Corps]] units before being equipped with [[Airco DH.5]] fighters. To differentiate the squadron from the British [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No. 2 Squadron RFC]], it was known to the British military as "No. 68 Squadron RFC".{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=10}} This terminology was never accepted by the AIF who continued to use the AFC designation regardless,{{sfn|O'Connor|2005|p=173}} and by January 1918 the British designation was officially discontinued.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=10}}

In late September 1917, the squadron flew its aircraft across the [[English Channel]], landing in [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] without incident or loss&nbsp;<U+2013> the first time a British unit had achieved this&nbsp;<U+2013> and after overnighting there they moved to [[Baizieux]]. Assigned to the 13th Army Wing, RFC,<ref name=AWM1>{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_10836.asp |title= 2 Squadron AFC |work=First World War, 1914<U+2013>1918 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> they undertook their first combat operations on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] a month later.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=14}} Its first major action came during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November and December when it was heavily involved as a low-level ground attack unit, attacking German trenches, but suffering heavy casualties in doing so.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=14}} On 22 November, the squadron shot down its first German aircraft in air-to-air combat during a chance encounter on a ground attack sortie. After this, several more German aircraft were shot down by the squadron's pilots before they withdrawn from operations in December to re-equip with [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s. In January 1918, the squadron moved to Savy, and the following month gained their first victories with the new aircraft type.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=10}}

The squadrons listed are: [[No. 4 Squadron RAAF|No. 4 Squadron AFC]], [[No. 88 Squadron RAF]], No. 2 Squadron AFC, [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 103 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]], and [[No. 54 Squadron RAF]].]]

In early 1918, the Germans launched a [[Spring Offensive|major offensive]] on the Western Front after the collapse of Russia allowed them to increase their forces in the west.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|pp= 127 & 141}} Falling initially against the British southern flank, the offensive pushed the Allies back significantly, and the squadron was forced to withdraw to airfields further back from the front as German forces advanced steadily: in March they moved to La Bellevue and then to Fouquerolles, remaining there until June when they moved to Liettres to support the French during the [[Second Battle of the Marne|Marne offensive]].{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}} During this time, the squadron was variously assigned to the [[Royal Air Force]]'s 10th, 22nd, 51st and 80th Wings,<ref name=AWM1/> and despite the moves, the squadron maintained a high operational tempo, becoming involved in heavy air-to-air combat during fighter sweeps, and also being used to attack advancing German ground forces.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=10}} After the German offensive was finally halted, the Allies launched their own offensive in August around [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] after which the squadron was employed to attack German airfields, and as the Germans were forced back, attacking withdrawing German troops on the ground.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=15}} Throughout October, in an effort to keep up with the advance, the squadron moved three times and by the time the armistice was signed in November it was based at [[Pont-a-Marq]].{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}}

Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was withdrawn to the United Kingdom in March 1919 as the demobilisation process began. On 6 May its personnel embarked on the transport ''Kaisar-i-Hind'' for repatriation back to Australia, at which time the squadron was disbanded.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}}<ref name=AWM1/>{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=15}} During the war, No. 2 Squadron produced 18 [[flying ace]]s,{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}} including [[Francis Smith (aviator)|Francis Ryan Smith]], [[Roy Cecil Phillipps]] (the squadron's highest scorer),{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}} [[Roby Lewis Manuel]], [[Henry Garnet Forrest]], [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|Adrian Cole]], [[Eric Douglas Cummings]], [[Richard Watson Howard]], [[Frank Alberry]], [[Ernest Edgar Davies]], and [[James Wellwood]].<ref name=aerodrome>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/australi/2.php|title=2 Squadron <U+2013> Australian Flying Corps of World War I |work=The Aerodrome|accessdate=1 August 2006}}</ref> The squadron<U+2019>s total score was 94 aircraft shot down, 73 out of control and 18 driven down.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=11}} Its casualties amounted to 25 personnel killed and eight wounded.<ref name=AWM1/>

===World War II===
In 1922, No. 2 Squadron was briefly formed as part of the newly independent [[Royal Australian Air Force]] at [[RAAF Point Cook|Point Cook]], Victoria, but it never progressed beyond a [[En cadre|cadre]] unit and was disbanded a few months later.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=15}} It was re-formed on 3 May 1937 at [[RAAF Base Laverton|Laverton]]. Following the outbreak of World War II, under the command of Squadron Leader [[Alan Charlesworth]], the squadron began maritime patrol and convoy escort operations off the Australian eastern seaboard, operating [[Avro Anson]]s, before being re-equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]]s in May and June 1940.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=22}}{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=15}} 

Wing Commander [[Frank Headlam]] took over command of the squadron in April 1941,{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=18}} and in early December 1941, shortly before Japan<U+2019>s entry into the war, the squadron moved to [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] where they maintained their maritime role and deployed detachments  to the islands to Australia<U+2019>s north, including [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. After the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], the squadron mounted reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese forces, focusing on Japanese shipping. Success came early with a {{convert|306|t|adj=on}} Japanese vessel being heavily damaged on 8 December, although heavy losses also came early on. In early 1942, the squadron<U+2019>s detachments were withdrawn back to Australia as Japanese forces advanced south, attacking the squadron<U+2019>s forward bases.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=22}} The squadron continued operations after this, maintaining an intense bombing campaign against Japanese shipping and installations on islands including [[Timor]] and Ambon from May to October during which 13 crews were killed. For its service, the squadron was awarded a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|US Presidential Unit Citation]].{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=15}}<ref name=AWM2>{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11021second_world_war.asp |title=2 Squadron RAAF |work=Second World War, 1939<U+2013>1945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>

Throughout 1942<U+2013>1943, the squadron continued operations with its Hudsons against the Japanese in the East Indies and conducted aerial resupply for elements of [[Sparrow Force]] that were fighting on Timor.  Late in 1943, the squadron began training on the [[Bristol Beaufort]], completing its conversion in January 1944. The squadron operated the type only briefly before converting to the [[B-25 Mitchell]] in May.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=22}} After being withdrawn from operations briefly, it recommenced combat missions in late June,<ref name=AWM2/> focusing on anti-shipping strikes, but also attacking Japanese airfields.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=16}} Late in the war, No. 3 Squadron moved to [[Balikpapan]] in [[Borneo]] where it was used to drop supplies to Allied troops in Japanese prisoner-of-war camps before undertaking transportation duties following the end of hostilities. The squadron returned to Australia in mid-December 1945 and was disbanded in May 1946 at Laverton. Casualties during the war amounted to 176 killed.<ref name=AWM2/>

===Post-World War II===
[[File:Canberra B20 2 Sqn RAAF over Vietnam 1970.jpg|thumb|right|220px|No. 2 Squadron Canberra in Vietnam, 1970]]

In the post-World War II period, the squadron was reformed briefly as a communications squadron based at [[Mallala, South Australia]], in June 1947 before a reorganisation early the following year saw it redesignated as No. 34 Squadron, while the previously existing [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No. 21 Squadron]], equipped with [[Avro Lincoln]]s at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], became No. 2 Squadron.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=17}} In 1953, the squadron was re-equipped with  [[English Electric Canberra]]s, which it later operated from [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Butterworth]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]], after deploying there in 1958 to relieve the Lincoln-equipped [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF]]. During the emergency, the squadron undertook airstrikes against communist forces and after the conflict ended, it remained in Malaysia throughout the early 1960s during [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|Confrontation]], before despatching eight Canberras to South Vietnam in April 1967 as part of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=23}}<ref name=AWM3>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11021vietnam.asp |title=2 Squadron RAAF |work=Vietnam, 1962<U+2013>1972 units |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

Based at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] in [[Ninh Thuan province]], the unit became part of the [[35th Fighter Wing|US 35th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (35 TFW) and between April 1967 and June 1971,{{sfn|Eather|1995|pp=23<U+2013>24}} the Canberras flew approximately 12,000 sorties.<ref name="RAAF Museum"/> Although the squadron initially undertook high-level night-time attacks, the majority of its operations were low-level daylight attacks, and according to historian Steve Eather, the squadron achieved a high success rate, accounting for 16 percent of 35 TFW's assessed bomb damage, despite making up only five percent of its missions, and maintaining a 97<U+2013>98 percent serviceability rate.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=24}}<ref name=AWM3/> They dropped 76,389 bombs and were credited with 786 enemy personnel confirmed killed and a further 3,390 estimated killed, 8,637 structures, 15,568 bunkers, 1,267 sampans and 74 bridges destroyed.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1995|p=215}} Five crew members were killed during the war,<ref name=AWM3/> and two Canberras were shot down in 1970 and 1971. One was brought down by a [[surface-to-air missile]] from which the crewmen&nbsp;<U+2013> one of whom was the squadron commander, Wing Commander Frank Downing&nbsp;<U+2013> safely ejected and were rescued via helicopter, and another was lost during a bombing run around [[Da Nang]].{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=17}} The crew of the latter aircraft were not recovered during the war and were posted as "missing in action"; however, the wreckage of their Canberra was finally located in April 2009 and their remains returned to Australia.{{sfn|Bell|2011|p=80}} The squadron was awarded the [[Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation]] and a [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award|United States Air Force Outstanding Unit Commendation]] for its service in Vietnam.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=24}}<ref name=AWM3/> During the deployment, the squadron's aircraft used the callsign "Magpie" in recognition of the squadron's emblem.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battle to bring our brave boys home |author=Powell, Sian |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=Surry Hills, New South Wales |publisher=News Digital Media (via Proquest) |date=20 June 2009 |page= 112}}</ref>

The squadron returned to Australia in 1971, having been deployed overseas for a total of 13 years.{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=17}} After Vietnam, No. 2 Squadron was based at  Amberley, west of [[Brisbane]], Queensland.<ref name="RAAF Museum">{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/units/2sqn.htm
 |title=No 2 Squadron |publisher=RAAF Museum |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> It briefly returned to bombing role in training, but in the later years of the Canberra bomber's RAAF operations, it was predominately used for [[target towing]] in support of the RAAF's fleet of [[Dassault Mirage III ]] fighters and aerial mapping of Australia and other locations including [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Irian Jaya]] and the [[Cocos Island|Cocos]] and [[Christmas Island]]s. Eventually, the squadron's Canberra bombers were retired from service and in late July 1982 the squadron was disbanded.{{sfn|Eather|1995|p=24}}{{sfn|Barnes|2000|p=17}}

The squadron was re-formed in January 2000 to operate [[Boeing 737 AEW&C| Boeing 737 Airborne Early Warning & Control]] (AEW&C) aircraft procured as part of ''Project Wedgetail'', out of [[RAAF Base Williamtown]] and [[RAAF Base Tindal]].<ref name="RAAF Museum"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Proud day for reformed No 2 Squadron |author=Staff |newspaper=Newcastle Herald |location=Newcastle, New South Wales |publisher=Fairfax Digital (via Proquest) |date=7 April 2000 |page=57}}</ref> On 26 November 2009, the RAAF accepted the first two 737 AEW&C aircraft,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=960 |title=Boeing Delivers 2 Wedgetail AEW&C Aircraft to Royal Australian Air Force |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref> and by the end of 2010, the squadron had begun training. In 2011, after a period of conversion training for its crews, it took part in [[Exercise Talisman Sabre]] with US and Australian forces.<ref name="RAAF Museum"/> The squadron currently forms part of the [[Surveillance and Response Group RAAF|Surveillance & Response Group's]] [[No. 42 Wing RAAF|No. 42 Wing]], which is responsible for the RAAF's AEW&C capability.<ref>{{cite news | title=New surveillance commander takes over |author=Beaumont, Anita |newspaper=Newcastle Herald |location=Newcastle, New South Wales |publisher=Fairfax Digital (via Proquest) |date=1 February 2005 |page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About_us/Structure_of_the_RAAF/Air_Command/Surveillance_and_Response_Group/?RAAF-Em/lTbOjboHa5jhkS926exeF05x7rnKL |title=Surveillance and Response Group |work=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>
