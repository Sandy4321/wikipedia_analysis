'''Varius Avitus Bassianus'''<ref>Born ''Varius Avitus Bassianus'', he took the name ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus''' upon his accession.</ref> (ca. 203 <U+2013> March 11, 222), commonly known as '''Elagabalus''' or '''Heliogabalus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 218 to 222. A member of the [[Severan Dynasty]], he was [[Syrian]] on his mother's side, the son of [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]]. Early in his youth he served as a priest of the god [[El-Gabal]] at his hometown, [[Emesa]]. Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus, and was called Elagabalus only a long time after his death.

In 217, the emperor [[Caracalla]] was [[assassinated]] and replaced by his [[Praetorian prefect]], Marcus Opellius [[Macrinus]]. Caracalla's maternal aunt, [[Julia Maesa]], successfully instigated a revolt among the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] to have her eldest grandson, Elagabalus, declared as emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on June 8, 218, at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]], upon which Elagabalus, barely fourteen years old, ascended to the imperial power and began a reign that was marred by infamous controversies.

During his rule, Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]], [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], with a lesser god, ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'', and forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, which he personally led. Elagabalus was married as many as five times, lavished favors on courtiers popularly assumed to have been his homosexual lovers, and was reported to have prostituted himself in the imperial palace. His reputed behaviour infuriated the [[Praetorian Guard]], the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and the common people alike.

Amidst growing opposition, Elagabalus, only 18 years old, was assassinated and replaced by his cousin [[Alexander Severus]] on March 11, 222, in a plot formed by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and disgruntled members of the [[Praetorian Guard]]. Elagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme eccentricity, decadence, and zealotry which was likely exaggerated by his successors and political rivals.<ref name=emperorsatbay>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire at Bay: Ad 180<U+2013>395 |first=David Stone |last=Potter |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415100577}}</ref> This likely propaganda was passed on and, as a result, he was one of the most reviled Roman emperors to early historians. For example, [[Edward Gibbon]] wrote that Elagabalus "abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures and ungoverned fury."<ref name="Gibbon">Gibbon, Edward. ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 1, Chapter 6.</ref> "The name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others" because of his "unspeakably disgusting life," wrote [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|B.G. Niebuhr]].<ref>Niebuhr, B.G. ''History of Rome'', p. 144 (1844). Elagabalus' vices were, "Too disgusting even to allude to them."</ref>

Elagabalus was born in 203<ref name="herodian-history-v-3">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre503.html V.3]</ref> as Varius Avitus Bassianus to the family of [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]] and [[Julia Soaemias|Julia Soaemias Bassiana]]. His father was initially a member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, but was later elevated to the rank of [[Roman Senate|senator]]. His grandmother [[Julia Maesa]] was the widow of the [[Consul]] [[Julius Avitus]], the sister of [[Julia Domna]], and the sister-in-law of emperor [[Septimius Severus]].<ref name="dio-history-lxxix-30">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 LXXIX.30]</ref> Julia Soaemias was a cousin of Roman emperor [[Caracalla]]. Other relatives included his aunt [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] and uncle [[Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus]] and their son [[Alexander Severus]]. Elagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god [[El-Gabal]], of whom Elagabalus was the [[high priest]] at Emesa (modern [[Homs]]) in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-3"/>

Elagabalus was initially venerated at [[Emesa]] in [[Syria]]. The name is the Latinized form of the [[Syrian]] ''Il<U+0101>h hag-Gabal'', which derives from [[El (god)|Il<U+0101>h]] "god" and ''gabal'' "mountain" (compare {{lang-he|<U+05D2><U+05D1><U+05DC>}} ''g<U+0259><u>b</u>ul'' and {{lang-ar|<U+062C><U+0628><U+0644>}} ''jabal''), resulting in "the God of the Mountain" the Emesene manifestation of the deity.<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Lenormant | first = Francois | authorlink = Fran<U+00E7>ois Lenormant | title = Sol Elagabalus | journal = Revue de l'Histoire des Religions | volume = 3 | page = 310 | year = 1881 }}</ref> The cult of the deity spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the second century. For example, a dedication has been found as far away as [[Woerden]] ([[Netherlands]]).<ref>"[http://www.livius.org/ga-gh/germania/woerden-elagabal.html An Early Dedication to Elagabal]" at [[Livius.org]]; the inscription is in now in Woerden's [http://www.stadsmuseumwoerden.nl/ city museum].</ref> The god was later imported and assimilated with the Roman sun god, who was known as [[Sol Indiges]] in [[Roman Republic|republican]] times, and later [[Sol Invictus]] during the 2nd and 3rd centuries.<ref>{{cite web | author = Devlaminck, Pieter | title = De Cultus van Sol Invictus: Een vergelijkende studie tussen keizer Elagabalus (218<U+2013>222) en keizer Aurelianus (270<U+2013>275) | publisher = University of Ghent | year = 2004 | language = Dutch | url = http://www.ethesis.net/invictus/invictus_inhoud.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-07}}</ref> Avitus adopted the name of the god, being styled Elagabalus.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07206b.htm Biography of Elagabalus] at the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].

==Rise to power==
[[Image:Elagabalus Denarius Fides.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Roman [[denarius]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Fides Exercitus'', or ''The loyalty of the army'', depicting the Roman goddess [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]] between two [[Roman army]] [[Aquila (Roman)|standards]]. Many coins issued during Elagabalus' reign bear the inscriptions ''Fides Exercitus'' or ''Fides Militum'', emphasising the loyalty of the army as the basis for imperial power.]]

When the emperor [[Macrinus]] came to power he suppressed the threat against his reign by the family of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them<U+2014>Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus<U+2014>to their estate at Emesa in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-3"/> Almost upon arrival in Syria she began a plot, with her [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] advisor and Elagabalus' tutor Gannys, to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus as emperor.<ref name="herodian-history-v-3"/> Elagabalus and his mother readily complied and announced, falsely, that he was the illegitimate son of Caracalla, therefore due the loyalties of Roman soldiers and senators who had sworn allegiance to Caracalla.<ref name="herodian-history-v-3"/> After Julia Maesa displayed her wealth to the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] at [[Raphana]] they swore allegiance to Elagabalus. At sunrise on May 16, 218, [[Valerius Comazon Eutychianus|Publius Valerius Comazon Eutychianus]], commander of the legion, declared him emperor.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-31 LXXIX.31]</ref> To strengthen his legitimacy through further propaganda, Elagabalus assumed Caracalla's names, ''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus''.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-32 LXXIX.32]</ref>

In response Macrinus dispatched his [[Praetorian prefect]] Ulpius Julianus to the region with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough the crush the [[rebellion]]. However this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. The officers were killed and Julianus' head was sent back to the emperor.<ref name="herodian-history-v-4">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre504.html V.4]</ref> Macrinus now sent letters to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] denouncing Elagabalus as the ''False Antoninus'' and claiming he was insane.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-36 LXXIX.36]</ref> Both [[consul]]s and other high ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned him, and the Senate subsequently declared war on both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-38 LXXIX.38]</ref>

Macrinus and his son, weakened by the desertion of the [[Legio II Parthica|Second Legion]] due to bribes and promises circulated by Julia Maesa, were defeated on June 8, 218 at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]] by troops commanded by Gannys.<ref name="herodian-history-v-4"/> Macrinus fled toward [[Italy]], disguised as a courier, but was later intercepted near [[Chalcedon]] and executed in [[Cappadocia]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-4"/> His son [[Diadumenianus]], sent for safety to the [[Parthia]]n court, was captured at [[Zeugma (city)|Zeugma]] and also put to death.<ref name="herodian-history-v-4"/>

Elagabalus declared the date of the victory at Antioch to be the beginning of his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior Senatorial approval,<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-2">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-2 LXXX.2]</ref> which violated tradition but was a common practice among third-century emperors nonetheless. Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to [[Rome]] extending [[amnesty]] to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-1 LXXX.1]</ref> The Senators responded by acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting his claim to be the son of Caracalla.<ref name="herodian-history-v-5">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre505.html V.5]</ref> Caracalla and Julia Domna were both [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|deified]] by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustae]],<ref name="benario-soamias-mamaea">{{cite journal | last = Benario | first = Herbert W. | title = The Titulature of Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea: Two Notes | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 90 | pages = 9<U+2013>14 |  url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0065-9711%281959%2990%3C9%3ATTOJSA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N | accessdate = 2007-08-04 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.2307/283691 | publisher = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 90 }}</ref> and the memory of Macrinus and Diadumenianus was condemned and vilified by the Senate.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-2"/> The former commander of the Third Legion, Comazon, was appointed to be commander of the Praetorian Guard.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-4">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-4 LXXX.4]</ref>

==Emperor==
===First year===
[[Image:Elagabalus Denarius Fortuna Head.png|thumb|right|A [[denarius]] commissioned by Elagabalus, bearing his likeness]]

Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218 in [[Bithynia]] at [[Nicomedia]],<ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/> where the emperor's religious beliefs first manifested themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian [[Cassius Dio]] suggests that Gannys was in fact killed by the new emperor because he was forcing Elagabalus to live "temperately and prudently."<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-6">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-6 LXXX.6]</ref> To help Romans adjust to the idea of having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] in the [[Curia Julia|Senate House]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/> This placed Senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.

The legions were dismayed at his behaviour and quickly came to regret their decision to have him supported as emperor.<ref>''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#5 5]</ref> While Elagabalus was still on his way to Rome, brief revolts broke out by the [[Legio IV Scythica|Fourth Legion]], at the instigation of [[Gellius Maximus]], and the Third Legion, which itself had been responsible for the accession of Elagabalus as emperor, under command of senator [[Verus (senator)|Verus]].<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-7">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-7 LXXX.7]</ref> The rebellion was quickly struck down, and the Third Legion disbanded.<ref>{{ cite web | last = van Zoonen | first = Lauren | title = Heliogabalus | url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/heliogabalus/heliogabalus2.html#Life1 | year = 2005 | publisher = [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org] | accessdate = 2007-08-18 }}</ref>

When the entourage reached Rome in the autumn of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given powerful and lucrative positions, much to the outrage of many senators who did not consider them to be respectable.<ref name="herodian-history-v-7">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre507.html V.7]</ref> After his tenure as [[Praetorian prefect]], Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as [[Roman consul|consul]] twice.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-4"/> Elagabalus tried to have his presumed lover, the charioteer [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], declared [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-15">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-15 LXXX.15]</ref> while another alleged lover, the athlete Aurelius Zoticus, was appointed to the non-administrative but influential position of ''[[Cubicularius]]''.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-16">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-16 LXXX.16]</ref> His offer of amnesty for the Roman leadership was largely honored, though the [[jurist]] [[Ulpian]] was exiled.<ref>''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#16 16]</ref>

The relationships between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong, at first. His mother and grandmother became the first women to be allowed into the Senate,<ref name="augusta-elagabalus-i-4">''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#4 4]</ref> and both received Senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of ''Clarissima'' and Maesa the more unorthodox ''Mater Castrorum et Senatus''.<ref name="benario-soamias-mamaea"/> While Julia Maesa tried to position herself as the power behind the throne and subsequently the most powerful woman in the world, Elagabalus would prove to be highly independent, set in his ways, and impossible to control.

===Religious controversy===
[[Image:Elagabalus Aureus Sol Invictus.png|thumb|left|310px|Roman [[aureus]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Sanct Deo Soli Elagabal'' (''To the Holy Sun God Elagabal''), and depicts a [[quadriga|four-horse]], gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the [[Emesa]] temple.]]

Since the reign of [[Septimius Severus]], [[sun worship]] had increased throughout the Empire.<ref>{{ cite book | last = Halsberghe | first = Gaston H. | title = The Cult of Sol Invictus | year = 1972 | location = Leiden | page = 36|publisher= Brill }}</ref> Elagabalus saw this as an opportunity to install El-Gabal as the chief deity of the [[Roman Pantheon]]. The god was renamed ''[[Sol Invictus|Deus Sol Invictus]]'', meaning ''God the Undefeated Sun'', and placed over [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-11">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]</ref> As a sign of the union with the Roman religion, Elagabalus gave either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]], [[Urania]], or some combination of the three, to El-Gabal as a wife.<ref name="herodian-history-v-6">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6]</ref> 

He provoked further outrage when he himself married the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa]], claiming the marriage would produce "god-like children".<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-9">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-9 LXXX.9]</ref> This was a flagrant breach of Roman law and tradition, which held that any Vestal found to have engaged in sexual intercourse would be [[buried alive]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', Life of Numa Pompilius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10 10]</ref>

A lavish temple called the [[Elagabalium]] was built on the east face of the [[Palatine Hill]] to house El-Gabal, who was represented by a black conical [[Baetylus|meteorite]] from Emesa.<ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/> [[Herodian]] wrote "this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them".<ref name="herodian-history-v-3"/> In order to become the high priest of his new religion, Elagabalus had himself circumcised.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-11"/> He forced senators to watch while he danced around the altar of Deus Sol Invictus to the sound of drums and cymbals,<ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/> and each summer [[solstice]] he held a festival dedicated to the god, which became popular with the masses because of the free food widely distributed there.<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/> During this festival, Elagabalus placed the Emesa stone on a [[chariot]] adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city:

<blockquote>A six horse chariot carried the divinity, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face of his god.<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/></blockquote>

The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], the fire of [[Vesta]], the [[Ancile|Shields]] of the [[Salii]] and the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], so that no other God except El-Gabal would be worshipped.<ref>''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 3]</ref>

===Sex/gender controversy===
[[Image:Aquilia Severa coin obverse.png|thumb|right|Roman denarius depicting [[Aquilia Severa]], the second wife of Elagabalus. The marriage caused a public outrage because Aquilia was a [[Vestal Virgin]], sworn by Roman law to [[celibacy]] for 30 years.]]

Elagabalus' [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] are the source of much controversy and debate. Elagabalus married and divorced five women,<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-9"/> three of whom are known. His first wife was [[Julia Cornelia Paula]];<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/> the second was the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Aquilia Severa|Julia Aquilia Severa]],<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/> but within a year, he abandoned her and married [[Annia Faustina|Annia Aurelia Faustina]],<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/> a descendant of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and the widow of a man recently executed by Elagabalus. He had returned to Severa by the end of the year,<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-9"/> but according to Cassius Dio, his most stable relationship seems to have been with his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], whom he referred to as his husband.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-15"/> The ''Augustan History'' claims that he also married a man named Zoticus, an athlete from Smyrna, in a public ceremony at Rome.<ref name=autogenerated1>''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#10 10]</ref> Cassius Dio reported Elagabalus would paint his eyes, [[plucking (hair removal)|epilate]] his hair and wear wigs before [[prostitution|prostituting]] himself in taverns and brothels,<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-14 LXXX.14]</ref> and even the imperial palace:

<blockquote>Finally, he set aside a room in the palace and there committed his indecencies, always standing nude at the door of the room, as the harlots do, and shaking the curtain which hung from gold rings, while in a soft and melting voice he solicited the passers-by.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-13 LXXX.13]</ref></blockquote>

Herodian commented that Elagabalus pampered his natural good looks by wearing too much make-up.<ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/> He was described as having been "delighted to be called the mistress, the wife, the Queen of Hierocles" and was said to have offered vast sums of money to the physician who could equip him with female genitalia.<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-16"/> Subsequently, Elagabalus has often been characterized by modern writers as [[transgender]], most likely [[transsexual]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Harry | last2 = Green | first2 = Richard | title = The Transsexual Phenomenon, Appendix C: Transsexualism: Mythological, Historical, and Cross-Cultiral Aspects.  | publisher = The Julian Press, inc | year = 1966 | location = New York | url = http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/appendix_c.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}</ref><ref name="glbtq-enc-elagabal">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Godbout | first = Louis | title = Elagabalus | encyclopedia = GLBTQ: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture | publisher = glbtq, Inc | location = Chicago | year = 2004 | url = http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/elagabalus.html | accessdate = 2007-08-06 }}</ref>

===Fall from power===
By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, particularly his relationship with Hierocles,<ref name="dio-history-lxxx-15"/> increasingly infuriated the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-7"/> When Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was quickly wavering, she decided that he and his mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced.<ref name="herodian-history-v-7"/> As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter [[Julia Avita Mamaea]] and her son, the thirteen-year-old [[Severus Alexander]]. Convincing Elagabalus to appoint his cousin as his heir, Alexander was bestowed with the title of ''Caesar'' and shared the consulship with the emperor that year.<ref name="herodian-history-v-7"/> However, Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard favored his cousin over himself.<ref name="herodian-history-v-8">Herodian, ''Roman History'' [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre508.html V.8]</ref> Following the failure of various attempts at Alexander's life, Elagabalus stripped his cousin of his titles, revoked his consulship, and circulated the news that Alexander was near death to see how the Praetorians would react.<ref name="herodian-history-v-8"/> A riot ensued, and the guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]].<ref name="herodian-history-v-8"/> The emperor complied and on March 11, 222 he presented his cousin, along with his mother Julia Soaemias. Upon arrival the soldiers started cheering Alexander, while ignoring Elagabalus, who ordered the summary arrest and execution of anyone who had taken part in this revolt.<ref name="herodian-history-v-8"/> In response, the Praetorians attacked Elagabalus and his mother:

<blockquote>So he made an attempt to flee, and would have got away somewhere by being placed in a chest, had he not been discovered and slain, at the age of 18.

===Historiography===
[[Image:The Roses of Heliogabalus.jpg|left|thumb|320px|''The Roses of Heliogabalus'', [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], 1888]]

A [[propaganda]] campaign against Elagabalus, traditionally attributed to Julia Avitus Mamaea, was instituted after his death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Many denigrating and false stories were circulated about him, and his eccentricities may have been exaggerated.  The most famous among these, immortalized in the 19th-century painting ''[[The Roses of Heliogabalus]]'', is that he smothered guests at a dinner to death with a mass of "violets and other flowers" dropped from above.<ref>''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/2*.html#21 21]</ref>

====''Augustan History''====
The source of many of these stories of Elagabalus's debauchery is the ''[[Augustan History]]'' (''Historia Augusta''), which scholarly consensus now feels to be unreliable in its details.<ref>{{ cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | page = 218 | isbn = 0198143575 }}</ref> The ''Historia Augusta'' was most likely written near the end of the 4th century during the reign of emperor [[Theodosius I]],<ref>{{ cite book | last = Cizek | first = Eugen | title = Histoire et historiens <U+00E0> Rome dans l<U+2019>Antiquit<U+00E9> | year = 1995 | location = Lyon | publisher = Presses universitaires de Lyon | page = 297 }}</ref> drawing as much upon the invention of its author as actual historical sources. The life of Elagabalus as described in the ''Augustan History'' is believed to be largely a work of historical fiction.<ref>{{ cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | page = 263 | isbn = 0198143575 }}</ref> Only the sections 13 to 17, relating to the fall of Elagabalus, are considered to hold any historical value.<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Butler | first = Orma Fitch | title = Studies in the life of Heliogabalus | journal = University of Michigan studies: Humanistic series IV | year = 1910 | location = New York | publisher = MacMillan | page = 140 }}</ref>

====Cassius Dio====
Sources more credible than the ''Augustan History'' include the contemporary historians [[Cassius Dio]] and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived from the second half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor [[Commodus]] and governor of [[Smyrna]] after the death of [[Septimius Severus]]. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in [[Roman Africa|Africa]] and [[Pannonia]]. Alexander Severus held him in the highest esteem and made him his consul again. His ''Roman History'' spans nearly a [[millennium]], from the arrival of [[Aeneas]] in Italy until the year 229. As a contemporary of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the ''Augustan History'', although it should be noted that Dio spent the larger part of this period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand accounts when composing his ''Roman History''. Furthermore, the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabalus' reign, as well as his own position within the government of Alexander likely imposed restrictions on the extent to which his writing on this period is truthful.<ref>{{ cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | pages = 145<U+2013>146 | isbn = 0198143575 }}</ref>

====Herodian====
[[File:Medal of Elagabalus.jpg|thumb|Medal of Elagabalus, [[Louvre Museum]].]]

Another contemporary of Elagabalus was [[Herodian]], who was a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c. 170 until 240. His work, ''History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius'', commonly abbreviated as ''Roman History'', is an eye-witness account of the reign of [[Commodus]] until the beginning of the reign of [[Gordian III]]. His work largely overlaps with Dio's own ''Roman History'', but both texts seem to be independently consistent with each other.<ref name="livius-herodian">{{ cite web | last = Lendering | first = Jona | authorlink = Jona Lendering | title = Herodian | year = 2004 | url = http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/herodian.html | publisher = Livius.org | accessdate = 2008-05-03}}</ref> Although Herodian is not deemed as reliable as Cassius Dio, his lack of literary and scholarly pretensions make him less biased than senatorial historians. Herodian is considered the most important source on the religious reforms which took place during the reign of Elagabalus, which have been confirmed by modern [[numismatics|numismatical]]<ref>{{ cite book | last = Cohen | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Cohen (numismatist) | title = Description Historiques des Monnaies Frapp<U+00E9>es sous l<U+2019>Empire Romain (8 volumes) | year = 1880<U+2013>1892 | location = Paris | page = 40 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | last = Babelon | first = Ernest Charles Fran<U+00E7>ois | title = Monnaies Consulaires II | year = 1885<U+2013>1886 | location = Bologna | publisher = Forni | pages = 63<U+2013>69 }}</ref> and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence.<ref>''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', CIL II: 1409, 1410, 1413 and CIL III: 564<U+2013>589.</ref>

====Edward Gibbon====
Gibbon (1737<U+2013>94) wrote:

{{cquote|To confound the order of the season and climate, to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amusements. A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished  by force from her sacred asylum, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex, preferring the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the principle dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, the empress's husband. It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice. Yet, confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.<ref name="Gibbon"/>}}

===Elagabalus in later art===
[[Image:Elagabalus Forchtenstein.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Elagabalus on a wall painting at castle Forchtenstein]]
Due to these stories, Elagabalus became something of a hero to the [[Decadent movement]] in the late 19th century.<ref name="glbtq-enc-elagabal"/> He appears in many paintings and poems as the epitome of an amoral aesthete. His life and character has inspired or at least informed many famous artworks, including the following:
