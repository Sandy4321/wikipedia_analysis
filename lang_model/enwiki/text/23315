'''William Windsor''' (known as '''Billy'''), a [[goat]] in the military, was a [[lance corporal#United Kingdom|lance corporal]] in the 1st Battalion, the [[Royal Welsh]], an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[British Army]].<ref name="BBC1">{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8058249.stm |title=Retiring army goat's new zoo home |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate= 22 May 2009}}</ref> He served as a lance corporal from 2001 until 2009, except for a three-month period in 2006 when he was demoted to [[fusilier]], after inappropriate behaviour during the [[Queen's Official Birthday]] celebrations while deployed on active duty with the battalion on [[Cyprus]]. He retired to [[Whipsnade Zoo]] in May 2009.

=== Temporary demotion ===

The deployment to Cyprus with the 1st Battalion was Billy's first overseas posting, and despite being ordered to keep in line, he refused to obey.<ref name="CBBC" /> He failed to keep in step,<ref name="BBC2" /> and tried to [[headbutt]] a drummer.<ref name="Western">{{citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152001626.html |title=Billy butts back into officer class |publisher=[[HighBeam Research]] |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)]] |date=28 September 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> The goat major, Lance Corporal Dai Davies, 22, from Neath, South Wales, was unable to keep him under control.<ref name="BBC2" />

Billy was charged with "unacceptable behaviour",<ref name="Aus" /> "lack of decorum" and "disobeying a direct order",<ref name="BBC2" /> and had to appear before his commanding officer, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Huw James.<ref name="Aus" /><ref>{{citation|title=Army battalion has got their goat|publication=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|The Metro]]|date= 28 September 2006|accessdate=15 March 2010|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/20337-army-battalion-has-got-their-goat}}</ref> Following a disciplinary hearing, he was demoted to fusilier.<ref name="BBC1" /><ref name="BBC2" /> The change meant that other fusiliers in the regiment no longer had to stand to attention when Billy walked past, as they had to when he was a lance corporal.<ref name="CBBC" />

A Canadian [[List of animal rights groups|animal rights group]] protested to the [[British Army]], stating that he was merely "acting the goat", and should be reinstated.<ref name="Aus" /> Three months later, on 20 September at the same parade ground,<ref name="Aus" /> Billy regained his rank during the Alma Day parade which celebrates the Royal Welsh victory in the [[Crimean War]].<ref name="Aus" /> Captain Simon Clarke said, "Billy performed exceptionally well, he has had all summer to reflect on his behaviour at the queen's birthday and clearly earned the rank he deserves".<ref name="Aus" />

Billy received his promotion from the colonel of the Royal Welsh Regiment, Brigadier Roderick Porter.<ref name="Aus" /> As a result of regaining his rank, he also regained his membership of the [[Mess|corporals' mess]].<ref name="Aus" />

Billy is not the first goat in the army to have troubles. At one time a royal goat was "prostituted" by being offered for stud services by the regiment's serving goat major to a [[Wrexham]] goat breeder.<ref name="Farwell" /> First charged with [[l<U+00E8>se majest<U+00E9>]],<ref>{{citation|last=Graves|first=Richard Perceval|title=Good-bye to All That|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=Oxford|year=1995|page=80|isbn=1-57181-022-6|accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref> the goat major was ultimately [[court-martialled]] under the lesser charge of "disrespect to an officer" and reduced in rank.<ref name="Farwell" /> The goat major claimed he did it out of compassion for the goat, but this failed to impress the court.<ref name="Farwell" /> Another royal fusilier goat earned the nickname "the rebel", after he butted a colonel while he was stooped over fixing his uniform's trouser-strap.<ref name="EIM">{{citation|title=The English Illustrated Magazine|publisher=Macmillan and Co|location=London|year=1898|volume=18|page=406|chapter=Regimental Pets|oclc=1567955|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ImEmBXmGKVYC&pg=PA406&dq=fusilliers+goat&lr=&num=30&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&client=firefox-a#PPA406,M1|accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref> The incident was described as a "disgraceful act of insubordination."<ref name="EIM" />

== Retirement and replacement ==
On 20 May 2009, following eight years of distinguished service,<ref name="BAN" /> Billy retired due to his age.<ref name="BBC1" /> Soldiers from the battalion lined the route from his pen to the trailer as he left the camp for the last time, in ceremonial dress that included a silver headdress which was a gift from the queen in 1955.<ref name="BBC1" /><ref name="Mail">{{citation|title = Billy the goat retires as Royal Welsh Regiment mascot... with full military honours | Mail Online| accessdate=22 May 2009| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1185019/Billy-goat-retires-Royal-Welsh-Regiment-mascot--military-honours.html}}</ref><ref name="PLAQUE">The plaque reads, "Billy/The Gift Of/Her Majesty/Queen Elizabeth Ii/To The/Royal Welch Fusiliers/a.D./Mcmlv" ([http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/20/article-0-05040A1C000005DC-884_468x279_popup.jpg picture])</ref> Billy was taken to Whipsnade Zoo in [[Bedfordshire]]<ref name="BBC1" /> where keepers say he will have an easy life at the Children's Farm.<ref>{{citation| title=William Windsor retires| url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/William-Windsor-retires.5313586.jp| date=28 May 2009|accessdate=29 May 2009| publisher=Hemel Today}}</ref>
