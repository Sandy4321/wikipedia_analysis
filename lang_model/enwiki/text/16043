"'''Shiver'''" is a song written and recorded by British [[alternative rock]] band [[Coldplay]]. British record producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] and Coldplay produced the track for their debut [[album]] ''[[Parachutes]]''. Vocalist [[Chris Martin]] admitted that "Shiver" was written for a specific woman, from whom the media has generated several speculations. The song contains influences attributed to American singer-songwriter [[Jeff Buckley]], whom Coldplay's early influences were drawn from.

The song was released as the album's [[lead single]] in the United Kingdom, and second in the United States following the hit single "[[Yellow (song)|Yellow]]". Initially a commercial disaster, it was later re-released in 2001. The single reached number 35 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and its critical reception has been generally positive.

==Production and composition==
"Shiver" was written two years before its release. Accordingly, Martin wrote the song while thinking of Australian singer-songwriter [[Natalie Imbruglia]], the woman he was linked to, but later denied it.<ref name="Roach33">{{harv|Roach|2003|p=33}}</ref> Some accounts have claimed, however, that Imbruglia was indeed not Martin's inspiration in writing the song. Instead, he appeared to have been inspired with girlfriends in his teenage days and early 20s. Martin actually wrote the song in a "glum" day, when he felt he would never find the right woman for him. He described it as something of a "stalking song", admitting he wrote it for a specific woman. In addition, Martin wrote the song while listening to music of Buckley, and had claimed it is their "most blatant rip-off song".<ref name="Roach34">{{harv|Roach|2003|p=34}}</ref>

"Shiver" was recorded in [[Rockfield Studios]] in [[Wales]], United Kingdom, where the band was booked by [[A&R]] representative Dan Keeling to begin working on the band's debut album, ''[[Parachutes]]''.<ref name="QState">{{cite journal|title=The State of Coldplay|month=August|year=2002|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|accessdate=2008-09-22|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="Inglis">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/ken.htm|title=Recording Coldplay's Parachutes|last=Inglis|first=Sam|date=October 2000|work=SOS|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> Keeling was disappointed with the early [[demo (music)|demos]] presented to him,<ref name="Roach33"/> saying it "didn't have any of their passion, their energy", a result of the band's freshly resolved internal pressure in the time. Keeling deemed the demos as "limp" and asked the band to redo it.<ref name="QState"/> Smaller parts of the song were recorded at Parr Street Studios in [[Liverpool]], England,<ref name="Roach33"/> where the band relocated after Christmas in 1999.

The song was produced by Coldplay and British record producer Ken Nelson.<ref name="Inglis"/> As with most songs in the album, Nelson used an analogue desk in recording "Shiver". The guitar was re-[[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] in search of perfection, while Martin de-tuned his guitar to easily generate complex chord sequences.<ref name="Roach33"/> Martin's vocals were recorded in more than one take, but the band chose the one with a single take.<ref name="Inglis"/>

"Shiver" is in the [[alternative rock]] genre. A review claims that Coldplay's [[indie rock]] inclinations are obvious in the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A3h9yxdyb2ola|title=Parachutes: Coldplay|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision Company|accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}</ref> "Shiver" has been perceived to have influences of Buckley,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/109811/review/5944377?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview|title=Coldplay: Parachutes|last=Diehl|first=Matt|date=2000-10-03|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref> whom Coldplay's early song influences were drawn from.<ref name="Roach9">{{harv|Roach|2003|p=9}}</ref> Martin later said of the song that it was "a blatant Jeff Buckley attempt, not quite as good, that's what I think".<ref>{{cite web |title=Coldplay's Chris Martin: 'I ripped off Jeff Buckley' |publisher=''nme.com''|work=[[NME]]|date=2008-12-18 |url=http://www.nme.com/news/coldplay/41730 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>

In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song: Jeff Buckley's 'Grace.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1539-parachutes/|title=Coldplay: Parachutes|last=Owen|first=Spences|date=1999-12-31|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref>

The [[music video]] for "Shiver" was directed by English film director and cinematographer [[Grant Gee]].<ref name="BashamShot"/> It features Coldplay performing in a small studio. The yellow globe featured on the ''Parachutes'' cover can be seen on top of an [[amplifier]] in the video. The music video received "strong exposure" on [[MTV]].<ref name="Roach35"/>

In 2003, "Shiver" was featured on Coldplay's [[live album]] ''[[Live 2003]]''.<ref>{{cite video|date=2003|title=Live 2003|medium=DVD|publisher=Capitol Records and Parlophone}}</ref>
