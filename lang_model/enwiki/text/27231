'''Evil Dead: The Musical''' is a Canadian [[off-Broadway]] show based on the cult classic [[Evil Dead series|film series]].

== Synopsis ==
Several [[college]] students spend the weekend in an [[abandoned]] [[cabin]] in the [[woods]], accidentally unleashing an [[evil]] terror.  In this comedic take on the 80s horror franchise, characters and demons sing and dance to songs written specifically for the musical. And, as in the films, [[Ash Williams|Ash]] is there to dish out his various one liners and fight the never ending [[Army of Darkness]]. Audiences are typically warned that the first few rows may get wet as the play calls for large amounts of [[stage blood]] to be splattered . ([[Ponchos]] are provided during the 15 minute intermission before Act Two).  

The musical takes creative liberty with the plot line of the movies, mixing together the characters and concepts of all three, as well as changing sequences for the sake of the stage and comedic intent.

== Production ==
With the approval of both [[Sam Raimi]] and [[Bruce Campbell]], a musical version of the film was staged, enjoying a successful workshop in Toronto and performances at the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal in 2004. The New York off-Broadway production started previews on [[October 2]] [[2006]].  The Official Opening Night performance was [[November 1]] [[2006]] and it ran, performing 8 times per week at the [http://www.newworldstages.com New World Stages], until [[February 17]] [[2007]]. Evil Dead: The Musical has recently started production in Toronto starting from [[May 1]] [[2007]] with the run extended from [[June 23]] [[2007]] to [[August 4]] [[2007]]. Recently, its run has been re-extended until early [[September]].

During the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the intransigent cast and crew performed the show on the front lawn of the Tranzac club in Toronto.  The band played acoustic instruments and cast members provided sound effects from backstage.  As the evening wore on, flashlights and car headlights were used to illuminate the actors.{{fact|date=July 2007}}

Fans enjoy the "splatter zone" -- the first three rows of the theater where patrons can count on a good blood-soaking. Ticket buyers in the Splatter Zone are advised to dress down. In fact, Toronto fans began wearing white t-shirts to take home later as bloody souvenirs which inspired the show's marketing team to start selling "I Survived the Splatter Zone" souvenirs.  Ryan Ward, who stars as Ash in the musical, described it as being "unlike any theater show you've ever been to. One word I would describe it as is 'raucous.' It's like a rock concert."
