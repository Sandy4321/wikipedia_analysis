The '''Ship John Shoal Light''' marks the north side of the ship channel in [[Delaware Bay]] on the east coast of the [[United States]], near the [[Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge]]. Its cast iron superstructure was exhibited at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

== History ==
Ship John Shoal took its name from an incident in 1797 in which the ''John'', captained by a Robert Folger, ran aground while on the way from [[Hamburg, Germany]] to Philadelphia. Passengers and cargo were unloaded safely, but the vessel was lost. (The figurehead is on exhibit in the Gibbon House Museum in [[Greenwich, New Jersey]], the town to which the rescued passengers were taken.)<ref name=lhf>{{cite web

Completion of the original [[Brandywine Shoal Light]] in 1850 led the Lighthouse Board to draw up plans to erect similar lights at Ship John Shoal and Cross Ledge. Both of these were intended to be of the then-new [[screw-pile lighthouse|screw-pile]] design. During construction of the [[Cross Ledge Light]] in the winter of 1856, however, ice carried away the entire structure, prompting reconsideration of the suitability of this type of foundation.<ref name="cghist"/> In the 1870s [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] foundations became available, and in 1873 [[United States Congress|Congress]] appropriated funds toward the construction of a caisson light on the shoal. Wooden piles were driven and the caisson placed in 1874; however, insufficient time remained in the working season to complete the light, and a temporary structure was placed to allow display of a light from November of that year.<ref name=lhf />

The incomplete structure managed to withstand the winter ice, but in January the keepers abandoned their temporary refuge out of fear that it would be overturned.<ref name=lhf /> They were able to return in March, but by then, the permanent superstructure had been diverted to the [[Southwest Ledge Light]] in [[Connecticut]]. An identical cast iron house was fabricated, but it was diverted to Philadelphia for display at the [[Centennial Exhibition]], where it was even occupied by a keeper tending a working light in its lantern.<ref name=lhf /> The house did not reach the caisson until the summer of 1877; in the meantime, a lightship was stationed alongside the unfinished structure. The base had also been surrounded with 2,000 tons of [[riprap]] to ward off ice damage.<ref name=lhf />

In 1907 additional riprap was dumped around the light, and about the same time a concrete platform was built on one of the two piles of rock in order to hold tanks for which there was no room in the light itself.<ref name=lhf /> In 1973 the light was automated, and four years later the original [[Fresnel lens]] was removed and replaced by a solar powered beacon, whose [[solar panel]]s stand on the platform where the tanks once rested.<ref name="NPS">{{cite web
