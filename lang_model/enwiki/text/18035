'''''Ratchet & Clank''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[platform game|platformer]]/[[shooter game|shooter]] video game for the [[PlayStation 2]], developed by [[Insomniac Games]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]. Released in 2002, it is the first game in the [[Ratchet & Clank (series)|''Ratchet & Clank'' series]].

The game's plot opens with [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]] meeting his robot companion [[Clank]]. Clank discovers that the villanous Chairman Drek of the Blarg race plans to create a new planet for his species, destroying the galaxy in the process. Clank convinces Ratchet to help him in his quest to gain the help of the famous superhero Captain Qwark, but they soon discover that Qwark is working for Drek, and have to save the galaxy on their own.

The game offers a wide range of weapons and gadgets that the player must use to defeat numerous enemies and solve puzzles on a variety of different planets in the fictional "Solana" galaxy. The game also includes several [[mini-game]]s, such as racing or lock-picking, which the player must complete to proceed. The game was positively received by critics, praising the good graphics and variety of gameplay, although some criticism was aimed at the camera angles and the personalities of the protagonists.

==Gameplay==
In ''Ratchet & Clank'', the main playable character is Ratchet, whom the player controls from a [[third person (video games)|third-person]] perspective. The player traverses diverse environments with a large collection of unusual gadgets and weapons, using them to defeat enemies and pass obstacles. Up to 35 weapons and gadgets can be bought or found in the game.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/375/375514p1.html | title=The Weapons of Ratchet and Clank<!--no ampersand (&)--> | work=IGN | author=Chris Roper | date=October 25, 2002 | accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> The player begins the game with only two weapons;<ref name="europebooklet" /> the "OmniWrench 8000", a standard melee weapon with a variety of uses, and the Bomb Glove, a short-range grenade thrower. As missions are completed across the game's various planets, more weapons and gadgets become available, including the Blaster, the Pyrociter (a flame-thrower), and the Suck Cannon (a weapon which sucks up smaller enemies and converts them into projectiles). Weapons are either found, or can be bought with bolts, the game's form of currency.<ref name="europebooklet">{{cite book
 | year=2002
 | title=Ratchet & Clank Instruction Booklet
 | publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
 }}</ref> These bolts can be found in crates, along with ammo, or dropped from defeated enemies.<ref name="europebooklet" /> The player also needs to buy ammo for most weapons, but a small number can function without the need for ammo.<ref name="europebooklet" /> Vendors, which sell weapons and ammo, are situated at strategic points throughout levels.<ref name="europebooklet" /> After completing the game, the player may choose to enter "challenge mode", in which the game's difficulty level rises considerably, but all bolts and weapons acquired the first time are carried through. There is also the option to buy "gold weapons", more powerful versions of existing weapons. The game's health system, [[nanotechnology|nanotech]],<ref name="europebooklet" /> starts at four health bubbles, but upgrades can be purchased, giving the player a total of eight hit points.

[[File:Ratchet & Clank screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Ratchet, with Clank on his back, using the Blaster. Visible are the ammunition, health, and bolt counters at the top of the screen.]]
Normally, Clank rides on Ratchet's back, acting as a jet-pack or similar device.<ref name="europebooklet" /> Occasionally, however, Clank becomes a playable character when Ratchet is unable to explore certain areas. Clank can control "Gadgebots", smaller robots similar to Clank, who perform certain actions for him. Racing, in the form of hoverboard races, appears in the game. Some racing missions are necessary to progress in the game, while others are optional. One level of space combat is also present. Mini-games to unlock doors, extend bridges, or elevate platforms appear in most levels.<ref name="europebooklet" />

==Plot==
On planet Quartu, an assembly line is producing large, destructive robots when suddenly there is an error, and a small, curious robot emerges. The robot encounters a video recording on an infobot. Horrified by its contents, the robot escapes the planet in a spaceship, only to be shot down over the planet Veldin.

On Veldin, [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]] is constructing his spaceship when the robot crash-lands near his home. Ratchet recovers the robot from the wreckage, nicknaming him "[[Clank]]". Clank shows Ratchet the infobot, which contains a recording of Chairman Drek of the Blarg race, who explains that his home planet is uninhabitable due to pollution. Drek's solution is to build a new planet for his race by extracting large parts of other planets, destroying them in the process.<ref>{{cite video game

Unfortunately, this will cause your planet to [...] drift into the sun, where it will explode...
 }}</ref> Fearing that Drek will destroy the galaxy, Clank asks Ratchet to help him find the famous superhero [[Captain Qwark]], in an effort to stop Drek. Ratchet is eager to leave Veldin in his ship, but can't without a vital component: a robotic ignition system. Equipped with a robotic ignition system, Clank starts Ratchet's ship in return for his help.

The two later find Qwark on planet Rilgar. Qwark encourages them to prove their heroic status by completing a dangerous obstacle course on the planet Umbris.<ref>{{cite video game

After they finish the course, however, Clank leads himself and Ratchet into a trap laid by Qwark, sending the two into a cavern. Here, Qwark reveals that he is working for Drek in order to become the spokesperson for the new Blargian planet.<ref>{{cite video game

After defeating the Snagglebeast, Ratchet becomes increasingly bitter towards Clank, angry that he let Qwark get the better of them. Clank urges Ratchet to continue their quest to confront Drek, but Ratchet is obsessed with revenge on Qwark.<ref>{{cite video game

Combining their efforts, Ratchet and Clank learn that Drek has developed a weapon called the "Deplanetizer". Drek aims to use it to remove Veldin, Ratchet's home planet, from the desired orbit of his newly constructed planet,<ref>{{cite video game

On Veldin, Ratchet and Clank confront Drek, who is about to obliterate Veldin. Drek reveals that it was he who polluted the Blargian home planet in the first place, and he plans to do the same to, and make more money from, his new planet after the living space has been purchased,<ref>{{cite video game

And the whole thing starts all over again.}}</ref> and this enrages Ratchet. A fierce battle ensues, after which Drek is killed. Ratchet uses the Deplanetizer to destroy Drek's planet, sending meteorites falling towards Veldin. Clank's arm is damaged by the meteorites. Ratchet offers to repair Clank, and as the game ends they walk off together as a team.<ref>{{cite video game

==Development and release==
After they finished working on the ''[[Spyro the Dragon (series)|Spyro the Dragon]]'', Insomniac originally intended to launch a game named ''Girl with a Stick'' for the Playstation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it and the idea was dropped after six months. ''Ratchet & Clank'' was based on an idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game;<ref name="ignhistory">{{cite web

Very little was cut for the final product, apart from a few weapons and gadgets which "just weren't fun".<ref name="gameplanetinterview"/>

Shortly after changing the game from ''Girl with a Stick'' to ''Ratchet & Clank'', [[Naughty Dog]] asked Insomniac if they would be interested in sharing the game technology used in Naughty Dog's ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy]]'', asking that Insomniac in turn share with them any improvements that they made to the [[game engine]]. After looking at the engine's abilities, Insomniac agreed.<ref name="gamasutrafeature">{{cite web

 }}</ref> The game's use of weapons, rather than simple [[melee]] attacks, was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games;<ref name="allgame" /><ref name="gamezone" /> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that "Going berserk with your giant ratchet [...] is seriously satisfying [...] Every time you thump an enemy with the hefty tool, it looks, sounds and feels remarkably solid. [...] What's more, the same can be said for all the other weapons you collect and use over the course of your intergalactic adventure".<ref name="cvg" /> [[GameSpot]] noted that the player doesn't need to follow the same paths multiple times, as was common in platformers at the time.<ref name="gamespot" /> [[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] said that it was "Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format!"<ref name="gameplanetreview" />

Reviewers praised the game's graphics, specifically pointing out the character and background designs as being high-quality for PS2 games of the time.<ref name="eurogamer" /> [[GameSpy]] called the graphics "mind-blowing",<ref name="gamespy" /> and GameSpot praised the game's smooth [[frame rate#Frame rates in video games|frame rate]].<ref name="gamespot" /> [[GameZone]] noted the animation of Ratchet, praising the details in his animation.<ref name="gamezone" /> Reviewers found that the game's [[voice over]]s and other audio elements were generally well done.<ref name="ign" /> [[IGN]] commented on the game's [[artificial intelligence]], saying that it wasn't as well done as that of ''[[Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy]]'', but still "purposefully comic and somewhat sophisticated" in others.<ref name="ign" /> Gameplanet felt that the game's levels were well laid-out.<ref name="gameplanetreview" />

Criticism was aimed at the game's camera angles, which [[Eurogamer]] felt were "idiotic" at times, giving the example of [[boss fight]]s in which the camera centers on the boss rather than being freely movable.<ref name="eurogamer" /> [[Allgame]] found that it was hard to form an emotional bond with ''Ratchet & Clank''{{'}}s main characters, saying that Ratchet is "your typical teenager [...] who desires nothing more than excitement and adventure" and that Clank is "the stereotypical intellectual; stuffy and almost prudish to a fault", feeling instead that the characters of Jak and Daxter from ''Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy'' were "infinitely more likeable."<ref name="allgame" /> Some criticisms were also aimed at the story, with GameSpy saying that the game became predictable, boring and "just bland".<ref name="gamespy" /> Reviewers also noted that the first half of the game was "yawn inducing", but once the player reaches planet Rilgar it becomes much more intense and difficult;<ref name="gameinformer" /> ''[[GamePro]]'' found that the player doesn't "engage a single thought process" for the first parts of the game.<ref name="gamepro" />
