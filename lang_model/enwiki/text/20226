'''<U+00D3>c Eo''' (from the [[Khmer language|Khmer]] <big><big><big><U+17A2><U+17BC><U+179A><U+1780><U+17C2><U+179C></big></big></big>, "O'keo", or "Or Gaio", meaning "Glass canal") is an archaeological site in [[Tho<U+1EA1>i S<U+01A1>n District]] in southern [[An Giang Province]], [[Vietnam]], in the [[Mekong River Delta]] region of Vietnam.  It is also one of the modern day [[communes of Vietnam]].  <U+00D3>c Eo may have been a busy port of the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] between the 1st and 7th centuries AD.  Scholars use the term "<U+00D3>c Eo Culture" to refer to the ancient [[material culture]] of the Mekong Delta region that is typified by the artifacts recovered at <U+00D3>c Eo through archeological investigation.

==The Archeological Site==
[[File:Sites of Oc Eo Culture in Southern Vietnam.jpg|150 px|left|This map shows the locations of archeological sites associated with Oc Eo culture.  It is located at the Museum of Vietnamese History, Ho Chi Minh City.]]
Excavation at <U+00D3>c Eo began on February 10, 1942 after French archaeologists had discovered the site through the use of aerial photography. The first excavations were led by [[Louis Malleret]].  The site covers 450 ha.

<U+00D3>c Eo is situated within a network of ancient canals that crisscross the low flatland of the [[Mekong Delta]].  One of the canals connects <U+00D3>c Eo to  the town's seaport while another goes 42 miles north-northeast to [[Angkor Borei]].  <U+00D3>c Eo is longitudinally bisected by a canal, and there are four transverse canals along which pile-supported houses were perhaps ranged.<ref>Paul L<U+00E9>vy, <U+201C>Recent Archaeological Researches by the <U+00C9>cole Fran<U+00E7>ais d<U+2019>Extr<U+00EA>me Orient, French Indo-China, 1940-1945<U+201D>, in Kalidas Nag (ed.), ''Sir William Jones: Bicentenary of his Birth Commenoration Volume, 1746-1946,'' Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1948, pp.118-19; paraphrased in R. C. Majumdar, ''Ancient Indian colonisation in South-East Asia,'' Baroda, B.J. : Sandesara, 1963, pp.12-13.</ref>

Archeological sites reflecting the material culture of <U+00D3>c Eo are spread throughout southern Vietnam, but are most heavily concentrated in the area of the Mekong Delta to the south and west of [[Ho Chi Minh City]].  The most significant site, aside from <U+00D3>c Eo itself, is at Th<U+00E1>p Mu<U+1EDD>i north of the [[Tien Giang]] River, where among other remains a stele with a 6th-century [[Sanskrit]] text has been discovered.

Aerial photography in 1958 revealed that during the [[Funan]] period a distributary of the Mekong entered the Gulf of Thailand in the vicinity of Ta Keo, which was then on the shore but since then become separated by some distance from the sea as a result of siltation. At that time, Ta Keo was connected by a canal with Oc Eo, allowing it access to the Gulf.<ref>Aulis Lind, <U+201C>Ancient canals and environments of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam<U+201D>, ''Journal of Geography,'' vol.79, no.2, February 1980, pp.74-75.</ref> The distributary of the Mekong revealed in the aerial photography was probably the ''Saenus'' mentioned in [[Claudius Ptolemy]]<U+2019>s ''Geography'' as the western branch of the Mekong, which Ptolemy called the ''Cottiaris''.<ref>Identified as such by C.

==<U+00D3>c Eo and Funan==
{{See also|Funan}}
<U+00D3>c Eo has been regarded as belonging to the historical kingdom of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] (<U+6276><U+5357>) that flourished in the Mekong Delta between the 1st and the 6th century CE.  The kingdom of Funan is known to us from the works of ancient Chinese historians, especially writers of dynastic histories, who in turn drew from the testimony of Chinese diplomats and travellers, and of foreign (including Funanese) embassies to the Chinese imperial courts.  Indeed, the name "Funan" itself is an artifact of the Chinese histories, and does not appear in the [[paleography|paleographic]] record of ancient Vietnam or Cambodia.  From the Chinese sources, however, it can be determined that a polity called "Funan" by the Chinese was the dominant polity located in the Mekong Delta region.  As a result, archeological discoveries in that region that can be dated to the period of Funan have been identified with the historical polity of Funan.  The discoveries at <U+00D3>c Eo and related sites are our primary source for the [[material culture]] of Funan.

The Vietnamese archaeologist and historian [[H<U+00E0> V<U+0103>n T<U+1EA5>n]] has written that at the present stage of knowledge, it was impossible to demonstrate the existence of a Funan culture, widely spread from the Mekong Delta through the Chao Praya delta to Burma, with Oc Eo as the typical representative: the presence of similar artefacts such as jewelry and seals from sites in those areas was simply the result of trade and exchange, while each of the sites bore the signs of their own separate cultural development. He supported the view of Claude Jacques that, in view of the complete lack of any [[Cambodia|Khmer]] records relating to a kingdom by the name of Funan, use of this name should be abandoned in favour of the names, such as ''Aninditapura'', ''Bhavapura'', ''Shresthapura'' and ''Vyadhapura'', which are known from inscriptions to have been used at the time for cities in the region and provide a more accurate idea of the true geography of the ancient Khmer territory.<ref>Claude Jacques, <U+201C><U+2018>Funan<U+2019>, <U+2018>Zhenla<U+2019>: The Reality Concealed by these Chinese Views of Indochina<U+201D>, in R. B. Smith and W. Watson (eds.), ''Early South East Asia : Essays in Archaeology, History and Historical Geography,'' New York, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp.371-9.</ref> H<U+00E0> V<U+0103>n T<U+1EA5>n argued that, from the late neolithic or early metal age, <U+00D3>c Eo gradually emerged as an economic and cultural centre of the Mekong Delta and, with an important position on the Southeast Asian sea routes, became a meeting place for craftsmen and traders, which provided adequate conditions for urbanization, receiving foreign influences, notably from India, which in turn stimulated internal development.<ref>Ha Van Tan, "<U+00D3>c Eo: Endogenous and Exogenous Elements", ''Viet Nam Social Sciences,'' 1-2 (7-8), 1986, pp. 91-101.</ref>

Funan was part of the region of Southeast Asis referred to in ancient Indian texts as [[Suwannaphum|Suvarnabhumi]], and may have been the part to which the term was first applied.<ref>Pang Khat, <U+00AB>Le Bouddhisme au Cambodge<U+00BB>, Ren<U+00E9> de Berval, ''Pr<U+00E9>sence du Bouddhisme,'' Paris, Gallimard, 1987, pp.535-551, pp.537, 538; Amarajiva Lochan, <U+201D>India and Thailand: Early Trade Routes and Sea Ports<U+201D>, S.K.

==Oc Eo as the Kattigara of Ptolemy==

Bhattacharyya, Kolkata, Punthi Pustak, 1998, p.413.</ref>  

Scholarship has now determined that Ptolemy's Kattigara was at eight and a half degrees North of the Equator, and was the forerunner of [[Saigon]] as the main port and entrepot at the mouth of the Mekong.<ref>Albert Herrmann, <U+201C>Der Magnus Sinus und Cattigara nach Ptolemaeus<U+201D>, ''Comptes Rendus du 15me Congr<U+00E8>s International de G<U+00E9>ographie,'' Amsterdam, 1938, Leiden, Brill, 1938, tome II, sect.

John Caverhill deduced in 1767 that Cattigara was the Mekong Delta port [[Banteaymeas]] (now [[H<U+00E0> Ti<U+00EA>n]]), not far from <U+00D3>c Eo.<ref>John Caverhill, <U+201C>Some Attempts to ascertain the utmost Extent of the Knowledge of the Ancients in the East Indies<U+201D>, ''Philosophical Transactions,'' vol.57, 1767, pp.155-174.</ref> The plea in 1979 by Jeremy H.C.S.

The eighteenth century French geographer, [[Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]], located Cattigara at the mouth of the Mekong (''Cottiaris'') River, where it is shown on his map, ''Orbis Veteribus Notus'' (The World Known to the Ancients).<ref>Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d' Anville, ''Eclaircissements g<U+00E9>ographiques sur la carte de l'Inde,'' Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1753, pp.160-161;  Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d' Anville, ''A Geographical Illustration of the Map of India, Translated by William Herbert,'' London, 1759, p.78; ''Atlas de d'Anville,'' 1786.

[[File:DAnville Cattigara 1794.jpg|thumb|Cattigara located at the mouth of the Mekong (Cottiaris) River, by d' Anville, Orbis Veteribus Notus (The World Known to the Ancients).]]

The Swedish yachtsmand and writer Bjorn Landstr<U+00F6>m also concluded, from the sailing directions given by the ancient merchant and seafarer Alexander, that Cattigara lay at the mouth of the Mekong.<ref>Bjorn Landstr<U+00F6>m, ''The quest for India : a History of Discovery and Exploration from the Expedition to the Land of Punt in 1493 B.C. to the Discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 A.D., in words and pictures,'' London, Allen & Unwin, 1964, p.56.</ref> 

The <U+201C>father of Early Southeast Asian History<U+201D>, George Coed<U+00E8>s, has said: <U+201C>By the middle of the 3rd century Fu-nan had already established relations with China and India, and it is doubtless on the west coast of the Gulf of Siam that the furthest point reached by Hellenistic navigators is to be found, that is the harbour of Kattigara mentioned by Ptolemy<U+201D>.<ref>George Coed<U+00E8>s, <U+201C>Some Problems in the Ancient History of the Hinduized States of South-East Asia<U+201D>, ''Journal of Southeast Asian History,'' vol.5, no.2, September 1964, pp.1-14. Coed<U+00E8>s clarified what he meant in his book, ''Les Peuples de la P<U+00E9>ninsule Indochinoise: Histoire - Civilisations''  (Paris,  Dunod, 1962, pp.62, translated by H.M. Wright, ''The Making of South East Asia,'' Berkeley, University of California Press, 1966, p.58-59): <U+201C>Now Fu-nan occupied a key position with regard to the maritime trade routes, and was inevitably a port of call both for the navigators who went through the Straits of Malacca and for those <U+2013> probably more numerous <U+2013> who made the transit over one of the isthmuses of the Malay Peninsula. Fu-nan may even have been the terminus of voyages from the Eastern Mediterranean, if it is the case that the Kattigara mentioned by Ptolemy was situated on the western coast of Indochina on the Gulf of Siam<U+201D>.</ref> A.H. Christie said in 1979 that <U+201C>the presence of objects, however few in number, from the Roman Orient<U+201D> added some weight to the conjecture that <U+00D3>c-eo was the Ptolemaic Kattigara.<ref>A.H. Christie, <U+201C>Lin-i, Fu-nan, Java<U+201D>, in R. B. Smith and W. Watson (eds.), ''Early South East Asia: Essays in Archaeology, History, and Historical Geography,'' New York, Oxford University Press, 1979, pp.281-7, see p. 286.</ref> The distinguished German classical scholar, Albrecht Dihle, supported this view, saying: 
<blockquote>From the account of the voyage of Alexander referred to by Ptolemy, Kattigara can actually be located only in the Mekong delta, because Alexander went first along the east coast of the Malacca peninsula, northward to Bangkok, from thence likewise only along the coast toward the south east, and so came to Kattigara. We hear nothing of any further change of course. In addition, at Oc Eo, an emporium excavated in the western Mekong delta, in the ancient kingdom of Fu-nan, Roman finds from the 2nd century after Christ have come to light.<ref>Albrecht Dihle, ''Umstrittene Daten: Untersuchenen zum Auftreten der Griechen an Roten Meer,'' K<U+00F6>ln und Opladen, Westdeutsch Verlag, 1964, S.30.</ref></blockquote>

==Columbus' search for Ciamba==
Guided by Ptolemy, the discoverers of the New World were initially trying to find their way to Kattigara. On the 1489 map of the world made by [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]], based on Ptolemy<U+2019>s work, Asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape, the Cape of Cattigara. Writing of his 1499 voyage, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] said he had hoped to reach [[Malacca]] (Melaka) by sailing westward from Spain across the Western Ocean (the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]) around the Cape of Cattigara into the Sinus Magnus, the Great Gulf that lay to the East of the Golden Chersonese ([[Malay Peninsula]]), of which the Cape of  Cattigara formed the southeastern point. The Sinus Magnus, or Great Gulf, was the actual [[Gulf of Thailand]].<ref>Albert Herrmann, <U+201C>Der Magnus Sinus und Cattigara nach Ptolemaeus<U+201D>, ''Comptes Rendus du 15me Congr<U+00E8>s International de G<U+00E9>ographie, Amsterdam, 1938,'' Leiden, Brill, 1938, tome II, sect. IV, ''G<U+00E9>ographie Historique et Histoire de la G<U+00E9>ographie,'' pp. 123-8</ref>

[[Christopher Columbus]], on his fourth and last voyage of 1502-1503, planned to follow the coast of [[Champa]] southward around the Cape of Cattigara and sail through the strait separating Cattigara from the New World, into the Sinus Magnus to Malacca. This was the route he thought [[Marco Polo]] had gone from China to India in 1292.<ref>George E.

On July 7, 1503, he wrote from [[Jamaica]]: <U+201C>I reached the land of Cariay<U+2026>Here I received news of the gold mines of Ciamba [Champa] which I was seeking<U+201D>.<ref>Letter dated 7 July 1503; quoted in J.M.
