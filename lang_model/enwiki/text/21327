'''Jan K<U+0159>esadlo''' ({{IPA-cs|<U+02C8>jan <U+02C8>kr<U+031D><U+025B>sadlo}}) was the primary pseudonym used by '''V<U+00E1>clav Jaroslav Karel Pinkava''' ({{IPA-cs|<U+02C8>va<U+02D0>tslaf <U+02C8>jaroslaf <U+02C8>kar<U+025B>l <U+02C8>p<U+026A><U+014B>kava}}) (December 9, 1926 in [[Prague]] - August 13, 1995 in [[Colchester]]), a [[Czech people|Czech]] [[psychologist]] who was also a prizewinning [[novelist]] and [[poet]].

An anti-communist, Pinkava emigrated to Britain with his wife and four children following the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by the Soviet-led armies of the Warsaw pact. He worked as a clinical psychologist until his early retirement in 1982, when he turned to full-time writing. His first novel "Mrchop<U+011B>vci" (GraveLarks) was published by [[Josef Skvorecky|Josef <U+0160>kvoreck<U+00FD>'s]] emigre publishing house [[68 Publishers]], and earned the 1984 [[Egon Hostovsk<U+00FD>]] prize.

He chose his pseudonym (which means [[firesteel]]) partly because it contains the uniquely Czech sound ''[[<U+0159>]]''; in addition, he was fond of creating more pseudonyms such as '''Jake Rolands''' (an anagram), '''J. K. Klement''' (after his grandfather, for translations into English), '''Juraj Hron''' (for his Slovak-Moravian writings), '''Ferdinand Lu<U+010D>ovick<U+00FD> z Lu<U+010D>ovic a na Such<U+00FD>m dole''' (for his music), '''Kamil Troud''' (for his illustrations), and more.

Pinkava was also active in choral music, composing (among others) a [[Glagolitic Mass]]. As well, he worked in [[mathematical logic]], discovering the many-valued logic algebra which bears his name.

A [[polymath]] and [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], Pinkava was fond of setting intense goals for himself, such as translating [[Jaroslav Seifert]]'s interwoven [[sonnet cycle]] about Prague, [[crown of sonnets|'A Wreath of Sonnets']]. He published a collection of his own poems in seven languages. Perhaps his most staggering achievement is ''<U+1F08><U+03A3><U+03A4><U+03A1><U+039F><U+039D><U+0391><U+03A5><U+03A4><U+0399><U+039B><U+038A><U+0391> ([[Astronautilia]]) Hv<U+011B>zdoplavba'', a 6575-line [[science fiction]] [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], an odyssey in classical [[Homeric Greek]], with its parallel [[hexameter]] translation into Czech. This was published shortly after his death, in a limited edition. (ISBN 80-237-2452-5)

At the time of writing only his first, prize-winning novel has been published in English translation, as GraveLarks (ISBN 80-86013-81-2)

He is the father of film director [[Jan Pinkava]] who received an Oscar for [[Geri's Game]] in 1998.
