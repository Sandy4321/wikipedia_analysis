'''Ganoga Lake''' is a natural [[lake]] in [[Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Colley Township]] in southeast [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. Known as '''Robinson's Lake''' and '''Long Pond''' for most of the 19th century, the lake was purchased by the Ricketts family in 1851 and became part of [[R. Bruce Ricketts]]' extensive holdings in the area after the [[American Civil War]]. The lake is one of the highest in Pennsylvania, which led Ricketts to rename it Ganoga Lake in 1881, after Pennsylvania senator [[Charles R. Buckalew]] suggested the name from the [[Seneca language]] word for "water on the mountain".<ref name ="HABS"/>

The Ricketts built a [[Clemuel Ricketts Mansion|stone house]] on the lake shore by 1852; this served as a hunting lodge and tavern. In 1873 a large wooden addition was built and operated as a hotel until 1903. The hotel had one of the first [[summer school]]s in the United States in 1876 and 1877. A branch railroad line to the lake served the hotel and also hauled ice cut from the lake for refrigeration. The hotel closed in 1903, though the house remained the Ricketts family summer home. After the death of R. Bruce Ricketts in 1918, his heirs sold much of his {{convert|80000|acre}} to the state for [[Ricketts Glen State Park]] and [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]]. When the lake was sold in 1958, the state tried to purchase it but was outbid by a group of investors who turned it into a private housing development.

Ganoga Lake is on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], just north of the [[Allegheny Front]], in sedimentary rocks from the [[Pocono Formation]]. The [[Wisconsin Glaciation]] some 20,000 years ago changed the drainage patterns of the lake, diverting its waters to [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]] and carving the 24 named [[waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park]] in the process. The lake has a [[continental climate]], with average monthly high temperatures ranging from {{convert|33|F}} in January to {{convert|82|F}} in July. Ganoga Lake's [[drainage basin]] is heavily forested and it is in an [[Important Bird Area]]. The lake and its surroundings have a variety of flora and fauna, although the ecosystem has been damaged by [[acid rain]].

Ganoga Lake is a natural [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring-fed]] lake just west of [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] in southern Colley Township in southeastern Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. It is near the meeting point of Sullivan, [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia]] and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties, and is less than {{convert|0.4|mi|1}} northwest of [[Ricketts Glen State Park]].

Ganoga Lake has a long narrow oval shape, oriented north-northwest to south-southeast. In 1936 William Reynolds Ricketts wrote that the lake has an average width of {{convert|700|to|800|ft}} and is "about one mile long, lacking 600 to 700 ft." or about {{convert|0.88|mi}} in length.<ref name = "HABS"/> However, according to a 1917 Pennsylvania Water Resources Inventory Report, in its longest dimensions it is {{convert|3720|ft}} long ({{convert|0.705|mi|disp=or}}) by {{convert|1025|ft}} wide.<ref name = "water resources"/> It has an average depth of {{convert|10|ft}} and a maximum depth of {{convert|13|ft}}.<ref name = "water resources"/> The [[drainage basin]] for the lake is an area of {{convert|1.5|sqmi}}, and its capacity is 373&nbsp;[[acre-foot|acre-feet]] ({{convert|121500000|gal|sigfig=4|disp=or}}).<ref name = "water resources">Pennsylvania Water Supply Commission, p. 70.</ref> 

A branch of [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]] flows from the southern end of the lake; {{convert|0.4|mi}} downstream it enters Lake Jean in Ricketts Glen State Park. From there the water flows through Ganoga Glen and its [[Waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park|10 named waterfalls]], then joins the main stem of the creek at Waters Meet; below this it flows over five more named waterfalls. Kitchen Creek is a tributary of [[Huntington Creek (Pennsylvania)|Huntington Creek]], which flows into [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]], which is a tributary of the [[Susquehanna River]].<ref name = "epa">{{cite web | title = Decision Rationale Total Maximum Daily Load for Low pH due to Atmospheric Deposition Lake Jean Sullivan and Luzerne Counties, Pennsylvania | url = http://www.epa.gov/reg3wapd/tmdl/pa_tmdl/LakeJean/LakJeanDR.pdf | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | date = August 9, 2004 | accessdate = February 7, 2010 }}</ref>

==History==
===First inhabitants===
Ganoga Lake is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Susquehannock]]s. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]], and by 1675&nbsp;they had died out, moved away, or been [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the [[Shawnee]] and [[Lenape]] (or Delaware).<ref>Richter, pp. 3<U+2013>46.</ref>

A standing man in a suit and two large trees are in front of the house.]]
On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]; this included what is now Ganoga Lake.<ref>Wallace, p. 159.</ref> After the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775<U+2013>1783), Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.<ref>Wallace, pp. 136<U+2013>141.</ref> The lake was originally in [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]], which was formed from the newly purchased lands in 1795.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Lycoming.pdf |title = Lycoming County 5th class |accessdate = February 5, 2010 | format = PDF | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]]}}</ref> Sullivan County was formed from  Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from [[Cherry Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Cherry Township]].<ref name="sullivan">{{cite web |url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/counties/pdfs/Sullivan.pdf |title = Sullivan County 7th class | format = PDF | accessdate = February 5, 2010 |publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}</ref> The lake drains into Kitchen Creek, where a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] pot, decorated in the style of "the peoples of the Susquehanna region", was found under a rock ledge about 1890.<ref>Wren, p. 56, Plate No. 7.</ref> 

A hunter named Robinson, whose cabin was at the lake's northern end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, for most of the 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga [[toll road|Turnpike]], which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of [[Berwick, Pennsylvania|Berwick]] in the south and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]] in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily [[stagecoach]] left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1907, when the modern [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.<ref name ="HABS">Ricketts, pp. 2<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name = "petrillo 40">Petrillo, pp. 40<U+2013>43.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url =http://www.bentonnews.net/Features/turnpikewilson.htm | title = Sketches from the Susquehanna-Tioga Turnpike | first = Kenneth T. | last = Wilson, Jr. | journal= Carver Magazine |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |date=  Spring, 1990 | accessdate = February 18, 2010 }}</ref> 

While on a hunting trip north of the lake in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 they bought {{convert|5000|acre}}, including the lake, as their own hunting preserve, and built a [[Clemuel Ricketts Mansion|stone house]] on the lake shore by 1852. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as "Ricketts Folly" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house.<ref name ="HABS"/><ref name = "petrillo 40"/>

===R. B. Ricketts===
Elijah's son [[R. Bruce Ricketts|Robert Bruce Ricketts]], for whom Ricketts Glen State Park is named, joined the [[Union Army]] as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and purchased the stone house, lake, and some of the land around it from his father in 1869; eventually he controlled or owned more than 80,000&nbsp;acres (32,000&nbsp;ha), including the lake and the park's glens and waterfalls.<ref name ="HABS"/><ref name = "petrillo 40"/>

At the horizon is a line of dark trees, and two branches stick out of the water in the middle of the image.]] 
From 1872 to 1875 Ricketts and his partners operated a [[sawmill]] near the lake, {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} southeast of his house. In 1872 Ricketts used lumber from the mill to build a three-story wooden addition next to the stone house; this opened as the North Mountain House hotel in 1873, and was run by Ricketts' brother Frank from then until 1898. The hotel hosted many of the Ricketts friends and relations as well as guests from [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], and other places. Many of the guests arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was [[Joseph Rothrock]], later known as the "Father of Forestry" in Pennsylvania.<ref name ="HABS"/><ref name = "petrillo 40"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/forestry/stateforests/rothhistory.aspx |title = History of the Rothrock State Forest |accessdate = February 5, 2010 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}</ref>

Ricketts and the others living in the area were not aware of the waterfalls in what is now the state park until about 1865, when they were discovered by two of the Ricketts' guests who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1881, Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator [[Charles R. Buckalew]] suggested the name ''Ganoga'', an Iroquoian word which he said meant "water on the mountain" in the [[Seneca language]].<ref name ="HABS"/><ref name = "petrillo 40"/> Donehoo's ''A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in  Pennsylvania'' identifies it as a [[Cayuga language]] word meaning "place of floating oil" and the name of a [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] village in New York.<ref>Donehoo, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Ricketts also used the name Ganoga for the tallest waterfall on Kitchen Creek and the glen it flows through, Ganoga Glen.<ref name = "rgsp"/>

Ricketts was a lumberman who made his fortune [[clearcutting]] nearly all his land, but no logging was allowed within {{convert|0.5|mi|sing=on|1}} of the lake,<ref name = "petrillo 50">Petrillo, pp. 50<U+2013>55.</ref> and the glens and their waterfalls in the state park were "saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family".<ref name = "sun">{{cite news| title = 50,000 will see Rickett's Glen Charms | author = | newspaper= Williamsport Sun | date = September 4, 1947 | page = 12}}</ref> One hemlock tree cut near the lake to clear land for a building in 1893 was {{convert|6|ft}} in diameter and 532 years old.<ref name = "petrillo 50"/>

Ricketts and his business partners built the lumber town of Ricketts about {{convert|4|mi|0}} northeast of the lake starting in 1890; it had up to 800 inhabitants and several saw mills and operated until 1913, when the timber was exhausted. A {{convert|3.85|mi|adj=on}} branch line of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] ran from Ricketts to the north end of the lake, opening in 1893. There was daily passenger service to Wilkes-Barre and Towanda on this line, which also served freight trains hauling ice from the lake for use in refrigeration from 1895 on. The ice cutting business on the lake employed 175 men, and had a {{convert|80|by|100|ft|sing=on}} [[Ice house (building)#In the U.S.|ice house]] at the north end of the lake, near the small train station made of logs. The Ganoga Lake Ice Company was incorporated in 1897, and operated until about 1915. Ricketts' son William Reynolds Ricketts was one of five partners in the ice company. Ice skating was also a popular pastime on the lake.<ref name = "HABS"/><ref>Petrillo, pp. 1, 50, 53, 55</ref> In 1913 the lake had a [[boathouse]] and was used by [[wikt:rowboat|rowboat]]s.<ref name = "water resources"/>

The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in 1897, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in 1903, and the fishing club and passenger train service ended with the closure. The stone house remained the Ricketts' summer home and was renovated and added to in 1913. Ricketts died in 1918 at the lake house, his wife died shortly thereafter; they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near the north end of the lake.<ref name="HABS"/><ref name ="petrillo 40"/>

===Modern era===
R. B. Ricketts and his wife had three children; their son William Reynolds Ricketts lived in the house after his parents' deaths. Between 1920 and 1924 the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] bought 48,000&nbsp;acres (19,000&nbsp;ha) from the Ricketts heirs, via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company. This became most of [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] Number 13, west of the lake in Sullivan County.<ref name = "petrillo 69">Petrillo, p. 69.</ref> These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over 12,000&nbsp;acres (4,900&nbsp;ha) surrounding Ganoga Lake and the glens with their waterfalls. The stone house was listed on the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] in 1936, which gave its name as "Ganoga". The area was approved as a [[national park]] site in the 1930s,<ref name = "rgsp"/> and the [[National Park Service]] operated a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp at "Ricketts Glynn" (''[[sic]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/ccc/camp.aspx?ID=188 | title = Camp Information for SP-9-PA | work = Pennsylvania CCC Archive | publisher = Pennsylvania CCC Archive |publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources | accessdate = December 20, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = The Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Park Service, 1933<U+2013>1942: An Administrative History | chapter = Appendix C, Table C-1: Directory of CCC Camps Supervised by the NPS (updated to December 31, 1941). | chapterurl = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ccc/cccac1.htm | publisher = National Park Service, Department of the Interior | first = John C. | last = Paige | year = 1985 | accessdate = December 20, 2009 | oclc=12072830}}</ref> [[World War II]] brought an end to this plan for development.<ref name = "rgsp">{{cite web | url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/rickettsglen.aspx | title = Ricketts Glen State Park | accessdate = November 23, 2009| publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}</ref>

[[File:Lake Ganoga from a Kayak.jpg|thumb|left|View of the lake from a kayak|alt=Triangular yellow prow of a boat in the foreground, on a smooth lake lined by dark trees under and reflecting a grey cloudy sky]]
In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261&nbsp;acres (510&nbsp;ha), including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought a total of 16,000&nbsp;acres (6,500&nbsp;ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000&nbsp;acres (4,000&nbsp;ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000&nbsp;acres (1,200&nbsp;ha) acquired from others.<ref name = "rgsp"/><ref name = "petrillo 69"/> 

William Reynolds Ricketts died in 1956 and the lake and surrounding land were sold in October 1957 for $109,000. The Department of Forests and Waters (predecessor of the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]) bid on the {{convert|3140|acre}} including the lake, but were outbid by a group of private investors. These "formed the Lake Ganoga Association in September 1959 to regulate and preserve the recreation and residential facilities at Lake Ganoga".<ref>Petrillo, pp. 68<U+2013>70.</ref> Thus, private development of houses on the lake only began in the 20th century.<ref name="Petrillo, p. 3"/> The association built a road around the lake, cleared some land at its southern end, and its members built about 50 houses on the lake shore. In 1983 the stone house, which now serves as the Ganoga Lake Association's clubhouse, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.arch.state.pa.us/pdfs/H000623_01B.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Clemuel Ricketts Mansion | accessdate = February 6, 2010 | author = McDonald, Teresa B.

==Geology and climate==
[[File:Ganoga Lake Map.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map shows Kitchen Creek flows southeast from Ganoga Lake, through Lake Jean, dry Lake Rose, and ten waterfalls in Ganoga Glen.

The rocks underlying Ganoga Lake are from the [[Mississippian]] [[Pocono Formation]], which is a "light-gray to buff or light-olive-gray, medium-grained, crossbedded [[sandstone]]", with some [[siltstone]] and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://tin.er.usgs.gov/geology/state/sgmc-unit.php?unit=PAMp%3B11 | title = Pocono Formation | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | date = February 9, 2010 | accessdate = February 16, 2010 }}</ref> The Pocono Formation formed more than 340&nbsp;million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of [[sediment]] made up primarily of [[clay]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found at the lake and in the [[drainage basin]] for [[Kitchen Creek (Pennsylvania)|Kitchen Creek]]: sandstone, [[shale]], siltstone, and conglomerates.<ref name="rggeology"/> 

Ganoga Lake is on the Allegheny Plateau, just north of the [[Allegheny Front]], which is the boundary between the [[dissected plateau]] to the north and the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] to the south. Kitchen Creek, which drains the lake, drops approximately 1,000&nbsp;feet (300&nbsp;m) in 2.25&nbsp;miles (3.62&nbsp;km) as it flows down the steep [[escarpment]] of the Allegheny Front.<ref name="rggeology">Braun, Inners, pp. 1<U+2013>13.</ref> About 300&nbsp;to 250&nbsp;million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the [[Alleghenian orogeny]]. This happened long after the [[sedimentary rock]]s at the lake were deposited, when the part of [[Gondwana]] that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming [[Pangaea]]. In the years since, up to 5,000&nbsp;feet (1,500&nbsp;m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land around the lake today.<ref name = "rggeology"/><ref name = "roadside">Van Diver, pp. 31<U+2013>35, 153<U+2013>155.</ref><ref name = "geology book">Shultz, pp. 372<U+2013>374, 391, 399, 818.</ref>

Prior to the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], Ganoga Lake drained into Big Run, a tributary of [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]]. This changed when the [[glacier]]s retreated to the northeast about 20,000 years ago, and formed [[glacial lake]]s. The retreating glaciers also left deposits of debris 20&nbsp;to 30&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;to 9&nbsp;m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run. Instead, water from Ganoga Lake and the area that later became Lake Jean was diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek.

Ganoga Lake is the largest tributary of Lake Jean, via a {{convert|0.4|mi|adj=on|1}} branch of Kitchen Creek. While Lake Jean lies entirely within Ricketts Glen State Park, much of its {{convert|1998|acre|adj=on}} drainage basin extends beyond the park, and Ganoga Lake's {{convert|960|acre|adj=on}} watershed accounts for nearly half of the total area. Lake Jean covers {{convert|253|acre}}; the remaining {{convert|1745|acre}} of the Lake Jean watershed are 81.0% [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|hardwood forest]], 12.6% [[pasture]]s, 4.7% other lakes (including Ganoga Lake's {{convert|78.8|acre}}), and 1.7% [[wetland]]s.<ref name = "water resources"/><ref name = "epa"/> The park has more than 80 species of vines, shrubs, and trees;<ref>{{cite book | url = http://departments.bloomu.edu/biology/Ricketts/index.html | title = Hiker's Guide to the Trees, Shrubs, and Vines of Ricketts Glen State Park | edition = 3rd |last = Chamuris | first = George P. | publisher = [[Bloomsburg University]] | location = Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate = February 22, 2010 }}</ref> [[Nyssa sylvatica|Black Gum]], [[Picea mariana|Black Spruce]], [[Tsuga canadensis|Eastern Hemlock]], [[Eastern White Pine]], [[Tamarack Larch|Eastern Larch]], [[Acer rubrum|Red Maple]], and [[Betula alleghaniensis|Yellow Birch]] are found in area forests.<ref name = "IBA"/>

Although there are no pollution [[point source pollution|point source]]s in the drainage basin, [[acid rain]] is a major concern.<ref name = "epa"/> In the 19th century Ganoga Lake was home to [[trout]] and [[Ameiurus|bullhead catfish]],<ref name ="HABS"/> and in 2007 Lake Jean was home to [[Brook trout|Brook Trout]], [[Brown trout|Brown Trout]], [[Brown bullhead|Brown Bullhead]], and [[Yellow bullhead|Yellow Bullhead]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fish.state.pa.us/images/fisheries/afm/2007/4x06_13jean.htm | title = Biologist Reports: Lake Jean, Luzerne County, Spring 2007, Sampling Gear: Trap Nets & Electrofishing | first = Aaron | last = Frey | publisher = Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission | date = Spring 2007 | accessdate = February 21, 2010 }}</ref> Acidification has altered the ecology of the lakes and region; in Lake Jean low [[pH]] has decreased the number and quality of insects and [[plankton]] at the base of the [[food chain]].

There are relatively few predators like [[Chain pickerel|Chain Pickerel]] and [[Largemouth bass|Largemouth Bass]], and adult fish "appear to have good growth rates but poor reproductive success".<ref name = "IBA"/><ref name = "epa"/>

Despite the increased acidity, all of the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, which includes Ganoga Lake, is classified by the state of Pennsylvania as a "High Quality-Cold Water Fishery".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/025/chapter93/s93.9k.html | title = The Pennsylvania Code <U+00A7> 93.9k.

Ganoga Lake and Ricketts Glen State Park are part of the much larger {{convert|114978|acre|adj=on}} Pennsylvania [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) #48, which the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]] describes as "the largest extant forest in northeastern Pennsylvania and one of the largest in the Commonwealth".<ref name ="IBA"/> Over 75 species of bird are known to breed in the state park adjoining the lake. Lake Jean is home to [[Bald Eagle]] and [[Canada Goose]]; aquatic birds found in the IBA include [[American Bittern]], [[American Black Duck]], [[Great Blue Heron]], [[Green-winged Teal]], [[Hooded Merganser]], [[Mallard|Mallard Duck]], [[Osprey]], [[Virginia Rail]], and [[Wood Duck]].<ref name = "IBA"/>

Ganoga Lake is on the Allegheny Plateau just north of the Allegheny Front; this region is known locally as North Mountain. Many bird species are found in the forests on North Mountain, including the state's only population of [[Blackpoll Warbler]]; other birds seen there include [[Evening Grosbeak]], [[Northern Goshawk]], [[Red Crossbill]], and [[Swainson<U+2019>s Thrush]]. Historically North Mountain was home to [[Olive-sided Flycatcher]], and "was one of the few places one could enjoy the songs of all of Pennsylvania<U+2019>s native [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es"; today it is home to the state's largest [[Yellow-bellied Flycatcher]] population.<ref name = "IBA"/> 

Ganoga Lake and its surroundings have a variety of insects and animals. Butterflies in the region are studied by [[lepidopterist]]s, and the [[Hemlock woolly adelgid|Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]] threatens many of the hemlock trees. Animals found on North Mountain and in the park include [[American Black Bear|Black Bear]], [[Fisher (animal)|Fisher]], [[Hoary bat|Hoary Bat]], [[North American River Otter|Otter]], [[North American Porcupine|Porcupine]], [[Raccoon]], and [[White-tailed deer|White-tailed Deer]].<ref name = "IBA"/><ref name="audubon">{{cite book|last= Audubon Pennsylvania|authorlink= National Audubon Society|coauthors= Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|title= Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail|origdate= 2004|url= http://web1.audubon.org/trailMaps/trail-guide/site.asp?id=86|format= Searchable database|accessdate= February 21, 2010 |location= Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|page= 36 }} ''Note'': This guide is available both as a book (page numbers given) and website (URL given).</ref> In 1912, White-tailed Deer around the lake became [[Local extinction|locally extinct]] due to loss of habitat from lumbering and overhunting.<ref>Petrillo, p. 53.</ref> Pennsylvania imported nearly 1,200&nbsp;White-tailed Deer from [[Michigan]] between 1906 and 1925 to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=587767&mode=2 | title = Abbreviated History of Pennsylvania<U+2019>s White-Tailed Deer Management | publisher = [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] | accessdate = February 22, 2010 }}</ref> By 2001, deer populations had increased to the point where it was feared that "Pennsylvania is losing its vegetative diversity from deer over-browsing".<ref name = "IBA"/>
