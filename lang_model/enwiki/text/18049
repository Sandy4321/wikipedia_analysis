'''Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II'''. Soon after implementation of the [[Munich Agreement]] of [[29 September]] [[1938]] (by which [[Czechoslovakia]] lost much of its border region to [[Germany]]) [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] and [[Slovakia]] declared their autonomy within Czechoslovakia, which [[Prague]] accepted. The autonomous Carpathian Ruthenia (officially known as Subcarpathian Ruthenia until then) changed its name to "[[Carpatho-Ukraine]]" soon afterwards, in November 1938. 

In November [[1938]], under the [[First Vienna Award]], which resulted from the [[Munich agreement]], [[Germany|Nazi Germany]] and [[Italy]] prevailed on Czechoslovakia to cede the southern third of [[Slovakia]] and southern Carpatho-Ukraine to [[Hungary]]. 

Following Slovakia's (formal) declaration of independence and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s occupation of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] on [[14 March|14]]-[[15 March]] [[1939]], on [[March 15]] Carpatho-Ukraine declared its independence as the [[Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]], with the [[Reverend]] [[Avhustyn Voloshyn]] as head of state. Hungary immediately invaded and annexed the new republic. On [[March 23]] Hungary annexed further parts of eastern Slovakia west of Carpatho-Rus. 

Carpatho-Ukraine ({{lang-ua |''Karpats<U+2019>ka Ukrayina''}}) was a short-lived [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] state that formally existed for several days only in March, 1939 in the easternmost part of [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] ([[Subcarpathian Ruthenia]], or [[Transcarpathia]]), and had been an autonomous region within Czechoslovakia for several months before that. The state was crushed by [[Hungary]] which annexed the area between March 15 and [[March 18]], 1939. 

On the eve of [[World War II]], the [[First Vienna Award]] allowed Hungary to annex Carpathian Ruthenia. However, the end of the war was a cataclysm for the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet [[gulag]]s. As a result of war losses, emigration and extermination of Hungarian-speaking [[Jew]]s, the Hungarian-speaking population of Carpathian Ruthenia decreased from 161,000 in 1941 (Hungarian census) to 66,000 in 1947 (Soviet census); the low 1947 number is doubtless in part a result of Hungarians' fear to declare their true nationality. 

In October [[1944]], [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] was taken by the Soviets. A Czechoslovak delegation under [[Franti<U+0161>ek Nemec]] was dispatched to the area. The delegation was to mobilize the liberated local population to form a Czechoslovak army and to prepare for elections in cooperation with recently established national committees. Loyalty to a Czechoslovak state was tenuous in Carpatho-Ukraine. [[Edvard Bene<U+0161>]]'s proclamation of April 1944 excluded former [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] Hungarians, Germans, and the [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile Ruthenian]] followers of [[Andrej Brody]] and the [[Fencik Party]] (who had collaborated with the Hungarians) from political participation. This amounted to approximately one-third of the population. Another one-third was communist, leaving one-third of the population presumably sympathetic to the Czechoslovak Republic. 

Upon arrival in Carpatho-Ukraine, the Czechoslovak delegation set up headquarters in [[Khust]] and on [[October 30]] issued a mobilization proclamation. Soviet military forces prevented both the printing and the posting of the Czechoslovak proclamation and proceeded instead to organize the local population. Protests from Bene<U+0161>'s government went unheeded. Soviet activities led much of the local population to believe that Soviet annexation was imminent. The Czechoslovak delegation was also prevented from establishing a cooperative relationship with the local national committees promoted by the Soviets. On [[November 19]], the communists, meeting in [[Mukachevo]], issued a resolution requesting separation of Carpatho-Ukraine from Czechoslovakia and incorporation into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. On [[November 26]], the Congress of National Committees unanimously accepted the resolution of the communists. The congress elected the National Council and instructed that a delegation be sent to Moscow to discuss union. The Czechoslovak delegation was asked to leave Carpatho-Ukraine. Negotiations between the Czechoslovak government and Moscow ensued. Both Czech and Slovak communists encouraged Bene<U+0161> to cede Carpatho-Ukraine. The Soviet Union agreed to postpone annexation until the postwar period to avoid compromising Bene<U+0161>'s policy based on the pre-Munich frontiers. 

After [[World War II]], in June 1945, Czechoslovakia and the [[Soviet Union]] signed a treaty ceding Carpatho-Ruthenia to the Soviets. Czechs and Slovaks living in Carpatho-Ukraine and Ukrainians (Ruthenians) living in Czechoslovakia were given the choice of Czechoslovak or Soviet citizenship. In 1946 the area became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] ('Transcarpathian [[Oblast]]').
