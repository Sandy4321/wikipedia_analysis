Rev. '''John Liggins''', (11 May 1829 <U+2013> 8 January 1912) Episcopalian missionary to China and Japan.  The first [[Protestant]] missionary and ordained representative of [[Anglican Communion]] to reach [[Japan]].

== Background and Early Life ==

Liggins was born at in 1829 in [[Nuneaton]], [Warwickshire]], [[England]].  In 1841, following the death of his father, Liggins emigrated to the United States of America, initially residing in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. In 1855, he graduated from the [[Virginia Theological Seminary|Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church]] at [[Alexandria]], Virginia. In November of the same year he sailed for [[China]] arriving in [[Shanghai]] on June 28, 1856.

== Missionary Work in Japan ==

Ill health, brought on by malaria, prompted Liggins to visit Japan in 1859, landing in the port of [[Nagasaki]] on May the 2nd of that year, two months before the official opening of the [[Nagasaki foreign settlement|foreign settlement]].  Liggins was the first recorded [[Protestant]] missionary to arrive in Japan after the country ended over two centuries of self-imposed isolation.<ref name="HistoricalSketch1883">{{cite book|title=A Historical Sketch of the Japan Mission of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.A|year=1883|publisher=Foreign and Domestic Mission Committee|location=New York|page=6}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|last=Liggins|first=John|title=The First Protestant Missionary in Japan, Letter to the Editor|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 30, 1900}}</ref>
Liggins appointed missionary co-worker the Rev.[[Channing Moore Williams]] arrived in Nagasaki on June 29th.  In October of 1859 Presbyterian missionaries Dr. and Mrs. [[James Curtis Hepburn]] also arrived in Nagasaki.  Liggins and later Williams were initially housed at Kotokuin within [[Shofuku-ji (Nagasaki)|Shofukuji Temple]] as the official foreign settlement was not yet ready for residence.<ref name="HistoricalSketch1883" />

Liggins immediately found employment teaching English to Japanese interpreters, but the new [[Nagasaki bugyo]] proclaimed that, in line with official government policy, he would not allow the teaching of Christianity. The religious duties of Liggins and Williams were thus mainly limited to serving as ministers for the American and British residents of the foreign settlement and to leading services for visiting sailors. Religious texts were not openly distributed, but the sale of academic publications afforded Liggins and Williams some engagement with eager Japanese purchasers on matters relating to Christian teaching. While in Nagasaki, Liggins prepared a book entitled <U+201C>One Thousand Familiar Phrases in English and Japanese,<U+201D> which was one of the first books of its kind written in Japan.

Ill health persisted, permitting Liggins to remain in Japan only ten months before leaving Nagasaki for the United States on February 24, 1860. Liggins never again set foot in Japan.

== Later Years ==

Returning to America, Liggins engaged in literary work and became a campaigner for the [[Temperance movement]], subsequently retiring to [[Cape May]], New Jersey where he spent the remaining years of his life. He was a regular contributor to the letters page of the New York Times and his death was duly recorded in that paper in 1912.  Among his published works were, <U+201C>England<U+2019>s Opium Policy,<U+201D> <U+201C>A Missionary Picture Gallery<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Great Value and Success of Foreign Missions.<U+201D>
