==History==

In the 1950s they co-managed [[Uno Chicago Grill|Pizzeria Uno]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Will|title=On the Town with Will Leonard|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=E-10|publisher=Tribune Company|date=1955-08-14|accessdate=2007-10-19}}

The Lincolnwood restaurant was successful, and the family subsequently opened another store in [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]]. After an initial rocky start, the second restaurant proved profitable and the company continued to grow. As of November 2012, Lou Malnati's owns and operates 35 stores in the greater Chicago area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bong|first=Bob|title=Business Comings & Goings: Lou Malnati Opens Thursday on 95th Street|url=http://oaklawn.patch.com/articles/business-comings-goings-home-run-inn-opens-thursday-in-beverly-668e0404|publisher=Oak Lawn, IL Patch}}</ref>  The company participates in the [[Taste of Chicago]] and has been active in local charities.<ref name=BNet/>

== Pizza style ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lou malnati product pix.jpg|thumb|Lou Malnati's Deep Dish Pizzas|right]] -->Lou Malnati's is a prototypical [[Chicago-style pizza#Deep-dish pizza|Chicago style pizza]], and is generally referred to as a "pie." A thin crust of pizza dough is laid in a seasoned deep-dish pizza pan and raised up on the sides.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Kathie|title=Chicago's Food History|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vmxPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ogQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6485%2C141981|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=May 1, 2007}}</ref>  The ingredients are placed on a Chicago style deep-dish pizza in the opposite order of a thin crust pizza. The first ingredient is thick slices of mozzarella cheese that are placed directly on the dough. Then additional ingredients like mushrooms, onions and sausage are spread on top of the cheese. The pizza is then topped with a tomato sauce made with whole chunks of tomatoes. A "Lou-Mal" pie uses a "sausage patty," a single patty of Italian sausage below the layer of tomato chunks or sauce, as opposed to the more traditional crumbled sausage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Olmsted|first=Larry|title=Great American Bites: Deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's in Chicago|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/great-american-bites/story/2011-12-08/Great-American-Bites-Deep-dish-pizza-at-Lou-Malnatis-in-Chicago/51716296/1|publisher=USA Today|date=2011-12-08}}</ref>
