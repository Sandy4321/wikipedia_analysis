The '''Herndon [[Monument]]''' on the grounds of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] is a tall grey [[obelisk]]. It was erected in memory of Captain [[William Lewis Herndon]] who courageously decided to go down with his ship, [[SS Central America|SS ''Central America'']], and the men left aboard rather than save himself on September 12, 1857. All women and children and many of the men aboard were saved by a nearby ship during the storm.

It is the site of the famous "plebes-no-more" ceremony, where the plebes (first year students at the academy) all work together to climb the greased monument and replace a plebe "[[Sailor cap|dixie-cup hat]]" on top with a [[combination cover]]. This is the official end of the plebe year.

It is a Naval Academy tradition that the [[Midshipman]] who replaces the dixie cup hat will be given a pair of [[Admiral's]] [[shoulder boards]]. Legend says that he or she will be the first of his or her class to make Flag Rank, although in reality this has not yet occurred.

The academy began recording times in 1959.  In 1962 Midshipman 4th Class Ed Linz scaled the monument with the aid of a cargo net. Using such devices is now banned.

The record was set in 1969, when Midshipman Larry Fanning made the climb in 1 minute and 30 seconds. However the monument was not greased.

Midshipman 4th Class Melvyn Davis of the Class of 1991 scaled the monument in 43 minutes and 44 seconds in May 1988, believed to be the fastest time since the tradition of greasing the monument began.

The 2010 Herndon Monument climb for the Class of 2013 took place on Monday, May 24, 2010 at 1:30pm. [[List of Superintendents of the United States Naval Academy|Superintendent]] [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Jeffrey Fowler]] indicated dissatisfaction that year with the risk of injury associated with the climbing tradition and a desire to discontinue it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/05/navy_herndon_climb_051210w/|title=Academy supe wants to end Herndon Climb|last=Ewing|first=Philip|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=[[Marine Corps Times]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>  Vice Adm.

The Herndon Monument climb serves as a useful event in reinforcing teamwork, organization and leadership."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2011/03/navy-academy-herndon-climb-greased-032311w/|title=Grease returns to plebes<U+2019> Herndon climb|last=Fellman|first=Sam|date=March 23, 2011|publisher=Marine Corps Times|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>
