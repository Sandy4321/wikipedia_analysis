The '''murder of Julia Martha Thomas''', dubbed the '''Barnes Mystery''' or the '''Richmond Murder''' by the press, was one of the most notorious crimes in late 19th-century Britain. Mrs. Thomas, a widow in her 50s who lived in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in west London, was murdered on 2&nbsp;March 1879 by her maid Kate Webster, a 30-year-old Irishwoman with a history of theft. Webster disposed of the body by dismembering it, boiling the flesh off the bones and throwing most of what was left into the [[River Thames|Thames]]. It was alleged, although never proved, that she had offered the fat to neighbours and street children as [[dripping]] and [[lard]]. Part of Mrs. Thomas's remains were subsequently recovered from the river. Her severed head remained missing until October 2010, when it was found during building works being carried out for the naturalist [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]].

After the murder, Webster posed as Mrs. Thomas for two weeks but was exposed and fled back to Ireland to her uncle's home near [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]]. She was arrested there on 29&nbsp;March and was returned to London, where she stood trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in July 1879. At the end of a six-day trial she was convicted and sentenced to death after a [[jury of matrons]] rejected her last-minute attempt to avoid the death penalty by pleading pregnancy. She finally confessed to the murder the night before she was hanged, on 29 July, at [[Wandsworth Prison]]. The case attracted a huge amount of interest and was widely covered by the press in Great Britain and Ireland. Webster's behaviour after the crime and during the trial further increased the notoriety of the murder.

==Background==
[[File:Residence of Mrs Thomas at Richmond.png|thumb|alt=Drawing of a suburban semi-detached house with a prominent bay window at the front and a deeply recessed entrance door|Mayfield Cottages, Julia Martha Thomas's house in Richmond. She lived in the left-hand portion (number 2) of the semi-detached villa.]]
Julia Martha Thomas was a former schoolteacher who had been twice widowed. Since the death of her second husband in 1873 she had lived on her own at 2 Mayfield Cottages (also known as 2 Vine Cottages) in Park Road in Richmond. The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a garden at the front and back. The area was not heavily populated at the time, although her house was close to a [[public house]] called ''The Hole in the Wall''.<ref name="O'Donnell13">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=13}}</ref>

Mrs. Thomas was described by her doctor, George Henry Rudd, as "a small, well-dressed lady" who was about fifty-four years old.<ref name="Rudd84">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=84}}</ref> According to Elliot O'Donnell, summing up contemporary accounts in his introduction to a transcript of Webster's trial, Mrs. Thomas was said to have an "excitable temperament" and was regarded by her neighbours as eccentric. She frequently travelled, leaving her friends and relatives unaware of her whereabouts for weeks or months at a time.<ref name="O'Donnell10">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=10}}</ref> She was a member of the lower [[middle class]] and as such was not wealthy, but she habitually dressed up and wore jewellery to give the impression of prosperity.<ref name="O'Donnell14">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=14}}</ref> Her desire to employ a live-in domestic servant probably had as much to do with status as with practicality. However, she had a reputation for being a harsh employer and her irregular habits meant that she had difficulty finding and retaining servants. Before 1879 she had only been able to keep one maid for any length of time.<ref name="O'Donnell14" />

On 29 January 1879, Mrs. Thomas took on Kate Webster as her servant. Webster had been born as Kate Lawler in [[Killane]] in County Wexford in about 1849. She was later described by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as "a tall, strongly-made woman of about 5&nbsp;feet 5&nbsp;inches in height with sallow and much freckled complexion and large and prominent teeth."<ref name="O'Donnell10" /> Many details of her early life are unclear, as many of her later autobiographical statements proved unreliable, but she claimed to have been married to a sea captain called Webster by whom she had four children. According to her account, all of the children died, as did her husband, within a short time of each other. She was imprisoned for [[larceny]] in [[Wexford]] in December 1864, when she was only about 15 years old,<ref name="Lloyds30Mar1879">{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper|location=London, England|date=30 March 1879}}</ref> and came to England in 1867.<ref name="O'Donnell58">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=58}}</ref> In February 1868 she was sentenced to four years of penal servitude for committing the same crime in [[Liverpool]].<ref name="Wilson193">{{harvnb|Wilson|1971|page=193}}</ref>

She was released from jail in January 1872 and by 1873 she had moved to Rose Gardens in [[Hammersmith]], London where she became friends with a neighbouring family called Porter.<ref name="O'Donnell7">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=7}}</ref> On 18 April 1874 she gave birth to a son, whom she named John W. Webster, in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=The Belfast News-Letter|location=Belfast, Ireland|date=2 April 1879|page=5}}</ref> The identity of the father is unclear, as she named three men at various times. One, a man named Strong, was her accomplice in further robberies and thefts. She later claimed to have been forced into crime as she had been "forsaken by him, and committed crimes for the purpose of supporting myself and child".<ref name="O'Donnell8">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=8}}</ref> She moved frequently around West London using various aliases, including Webb, Webster, Gibbs, Gibbons and Lawler. While living in [[Teddington]] she was arrested and convicted in May 1875 of 36 charges of larceny. She was sentenced to 18 months in [[Wandsworth Prison]]. Not long after leaving prison she was arrested again for larceny and was sentenced to another 12-month term of imprisonment in February 1877.<ref name="O'Donnell9">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=9}}</ref> Her young son was cared for in her absence by Sarah Crease, a friend who worked as a charwoman for a Miss Loder in Richmond.<ref name="Wilson193" />

In January 1879 Sarah Crease fell ill and Kate Webster stood in for her as a temporary replacement at Miss Loder's house. Miss Loder knew Julia Martha Thomas as a friend and was aware of her wish to find a domestic servant. She recommended Webster on the basis of the latter's temporary work for her.<ref name="Wilson194">{{harvnb|Wilson|1971|page=194}}</ref> When Mrs. Thomas met Webster, she engaged her on the spot, though she did not appear to have made any inquiries about Webster's character or past.<ref name="O'Donnell15">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=15}}</ref> After Webster was taken on by Mrs. Thomas, the relationship between the two women appears to have deteriorated rapidly. Mrs. Thomas disliked the quality of Webster's work and frequently criticised it. Webster later said:

{{quote|At first I thought her a nice old lady&nbsp;... but I found her very trying, and she used to do many things to annoy me during my work. When I had finished my work in my rooms, she used to go over it again after me, and point out places where she said I did not clean, showing evidence of a nasty spirit towards me.<ref name="O'Donnell19">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=19}}</ref>}}

Webster in turn became increasingly resentful of Mrs. Thomas, to the point that Mrs. Thomas attempted to persuade friends to stay with her as she did not like to be alone with Webster. It was arranged that Webster would leave Mrs. Thomas's service on 28 February.<ref name="Wilson194" /> Mrs. Thomas recorded her decision in what was to be her last diary entry: "Gave Katherine warning to leave".<ref name="Times31Mar1879">{{cite news|title=The Alleged Murder at Richmond|work=The Times|location=London|date=31 March 1879|page=11}}</ref>

==Murder and the disposal of the body==
[[File:Old Barnes railway bridge foreshore.png|right|thumb|Drawing of a river bank lined by a road on which people and horse-drawn wagons are passing, with an arched bridge in the background and a boat, on which a man is raising a sail, in the foreground|The Thames river bank below Barnes railway bridge, where a box containing Mrs. Thomas's remains was found on 5 March 1879 after being thrown into the river the previous day by Kate Webster.]]
Webster persuaded Mrs. Thomas to keep her on for a further three days, until Sunday 2 March. She had Sunday afternoons off as a half-day and was expected to return in time to help Mrs. Thomas prepare for evening service at the local [[Presbyterian]] church. On this occasion, however, Webster visited the local alehouse and returned late, delaying Mrs. Thomas's departure. The two women quarrelled and several members of the congregation later reported that Mrs. Thomas had appeared "very agitated" on arriving at the church.<ref name="Wilson194" /> She told a fellow congregant that she had been delayed by "the neglect of her servant to return home at the proper time", and said that Webster had "flown into a terrible passion" upon being rebuked.<ref name="O'Donnell23">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=23}}</ref> Mrs. Thomas returned home from church early, about 9 pm, and confronted Webster. According to Webster's subsequent confession:

{{quote|Mrs. Thomas came in and went upstairs. I went up after her, and we had an argument, which ripened into a quarrel, and in the height of my anger and rage I threw her from the top of the stairs to the ground floor. She had a heavy fall, and I became agitated at what had occurred, lost all control of myself, and, to prevent her screaming and getting me into trouble, I caught her by the throat, and in the struggle she was choked, and I threw her on the floor.<ref name="O'Donnell68" />}}

The neighbours, a woman named Ives (who was Mrs. Thomas's landlady) and her mother, heard a single thump like that of a chair falling over but paid no heed to it at the time.<ref name="D'Cruze53">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=53}}</ref> Next door, Kate Webster began disposing of the body by dismembering it and boiling it in the kitchen copper and burning the bones in the hearth. She later described her actions:

{{quote|I determined to do away with the body as best I could. I chopped the head from the body with the assistance of a razor which I used to cut through the flesh afterwards. I also used the meat saw and the carving knife to cut the body up with. I prepared the copper with water to boil the body to prevent identity; and as soon as I had succeeded in cutting it up I placed it in the copper and boiled it. I opened the stomach with the carving knife, and burned up as much of the parts as I could.<ref name="O'Donnell68" />}}

The neighbours noticed an unusual, unpleasant smell.<ref name="Rudd87">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=87}}</ref> Webster spoke later of how she was "greatly overcome, both from the horrible sight before me and the smell".<ref name="O'Donnell68">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=68}}</ref> However, the activity at 2 Mayfield Cottages did not seem to be out of the ordinary, as it was customary in many households for the washing to begin early on Monday morning.<ref name="Rudd87" /> Over the next couple of days Webster continued to clean the house and Mrs. Thomas's clothes and put on a show of normality for people who called for orders. Behind the scenes she was packing Mrs. Thomas's dismembered remains into a black [[Gladstone bag]] and a corded wooden bonnet-box.<ref name="Rudd89" /> She was unable to fit the murdered woman's head and one of the feet into the containers and disposed of them separately. She threw the foot onto a rubbish heap in Twickenham.<ref name="Rudd87"/> The head was buried under the ''Hole in the Wall'' pub's stables a short distance from Mrs. Thomas's house, where it was found 131 years later.<ref name="Telegraph" />

On 4 March, Webster travelled to Hammersmith to see her old neighbours the Porters, whom she had not seen for six years. Wearing Mrs. Thomas's silk dress and carrying a Gladstone bag which she had filled with some of Mrs. Thomas's remains, Webster introduced herself to the Porters as "Mrs. Thomas". She claimed that since last meeting the Porters she had married, had a child, had been widowed and had been left a house in Richmond by an aunt. She invited Porter and his son Robert to the ''Oxford and Cambridge Arms'' pub in Barnes.<ref name="O'Donnell33">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=33}}</ref> Along the way she disposed of the bag she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the [[River Thames]], while the Porters were inside the pub drinking.<ref name="Rudd89">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=89}}</ref> It was never recovered.<ref name="Rudd95">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=95}}</ref> Webster then asked young Robert Porter if he could help her carry a heavy box from 2 Mayfield Cottages to the station. As they crossed [[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], Webster dropped the box into the Thames. She was able to explain it away and did not arouse Robert's suspicions.<ref name="Rudd87" />
[[File:John Church sketch.png|left|thumb|alt=Profile drawing of a man with a high-collared shirt and jacket and a dark chest-length beard.|John Church, who bought Mrs. Thomas's furniture from Kate Webster and was falsely implicated by Webster for the murder.]]
The following day, however, the box was found washed up in shallow water next to the river bank about a mile downstream. It was spotted by Henry Wheatley, a coal porter, who was driving his cart past [[Barnes Railway Bridge]] shortly before seven in the morning. He initially thought that the box might contain the proceeds of a burglary.<ref>{{cite news|title=Untitled article|work=The Manchester Guardian|location=Manchester, England|date=10 March 1879|page=5}}</ref> He recovered the box and opened it, finding that it contained what looked like body parts wrapped in brown paper.<ref name="Times11Mar">{{cite news|title=Supposed Murders|work=The Times|date=11 March 1879|page=5}}</ref> The discovery was immediately reported to the police and the remains were examined by a doctor, who found that they consisted of the trunk (minus entrails) and legs (minus one foot) of a woman. The head was missing and was later assumed to have been thrown into the river by Webster.<ref name="Wilson195">{{harvnb|Wilson|1971|page=195}}</ref> Around the same time, Mrs. Thomas's foot and ankle were found in Twickenham. Although it was clear that all of the remains belonged to the same corpse, there was nothing to connect them with Mrs. Thomas and no means to identify the remains.<ref name="Rudd87" /> The doctor who examined the body parts attributed them to "a young person with very dark hair".<ref name="Times11Mar" /> After an inquest on 10<U+2013>11 March, which resulted in an [[open verdict]] on the cause of death,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper|date=23 March 1879|page=8}}</ref> the unidentified remains were laid to rest in [[Old Barnes Cemetery|Barnes Cemetery]] on 19 March.<ref name="Guardian30Mar1879" /> The newspapers dubbed the unexplained murder the "Barnes Mystery",<ref name="Rudd83">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=83}}</ref> amid speculation that the body had been used for dissection and anatomical study.<ref name="Times11Mar" />

It was later alleged that Webster had offered two pots of lard, presumably rendered from Mrs. Thomas's boiled fat, to a neighbour. However, no evidence about this was offered at the subsequent trial and it seems likely that the story is merely a legend, particularly as several versions of the story appear to exist.<ref name="Wilson195" /> The proprietress of a nearby pub claimed that Kate Webster had visited her pub and tried to sell what she called "best dripping" there. Leonard Reginald Gribble, a writer on [[criminology]], commented that "there is no acceptable evidence that such a repulsive sale was ever made, and it is more than possible that the episode belongs rightfully with the rest of the vast collection of apocryphal stories that has accumulated, not unnaturally, about the persons and deeds of famous criminals."<ref name="Gribble69">{{harvnb|Gribble|1957|page=69}}</ref>

Webster continued to live at 2 Mayfield Cottages while posing as Mrs. Thomas, wearing her late employer's clothes and dealing with tradespeople under her newly assumed identity. On 9 March she reached an agreement with John Church, a local publican, to sell Mrs. Thomas's furniture and other goods to furnish his pub, the ''Rising Sun''. He agreed to pay her <U+00A3>68 with an interim payment of <U+00A3>18 in advance.<ref name="Wilson196">{{harvnb|Wilson|1971|page=196}}</ref> By the time the removal vans arrived on 18 March, the neighbours were becoming increasingly suspicious as they had not seen Mrs. Thomas for nearly two weeks. Her next-door neighbour Miss Ives asked the deliverymen who had ordered the goods removed. They replied "Mrs. Thomas" and indicated Kate Webster. On being found out Webster fled immediately, catching a train to Liverpool and travelling from there to her family home at Enniscorthy. Meanwhile, Church realised that he had been deceived. On going through Mrs. Thomas's clothes in the delivery van, he found a letter addressed to the real Mrs. Thomas. The police were called in and searched 2 Mayfield Cottages. There they discovered blood stains, burned finger-bones in the hearth and fatty deposits behind the copper, as well as a letter left by Kate Webster giving her home address in Ireland. They immediately put out a "wanted" notice giving a description of Webster and her son.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=27 March 1879|page=7}}</ref>

[[Scotland Yard]] detectives soon discovered that Webster had fled back to Ireland aboard a coal steamer in the company of her young son. The head constable of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] in Wexford realised that the woman being sought by Scotland Yard was the same one whom they had arrested 14 years previously for larceny and were able to trace her to her uncle's farm at [[Killanne]] near Enniscorthy.<ref name="Lloyds30Mar1879" /> She was arrested there on 29 March by the local police<ref name="Guardian30Mar1879">{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=30 March 1879|page=6}}</ref> and was taken by the police to Kingstown (modern [[D<U+00FA>n Laoghaire]]); from there she travelled, under arrest, back to Richmond via [[Holyhead]].<ref name="Times31Mar1879" /> On hearing of the crime for which she was charged, her uncle refused to give shelter to her son and the authorities sent the boy to the local [[workhouse]], until such time as a place could be found for him in an industrial school.<ref name="Times31Mar1879" />

==Kate Webster's trial and execution==

July 1879 commemorating the trial, sentence and execution of Kate Webster.]]
As news of the murder broke a considerable number of people travelled to Richmond to look at Mayfield Cottages.<ref name="Times31Mar1879" /> Such was the notoriety of the affair that as Kate Webster travelled under arrest from Enniscorthy to Dublin, crowds gathered to gawk and jeer at her at nearly every station between the two locations.<ref name="Freemans31Mar1879" /> The pre-trial magistrates' hearings were attended by "many privileged and curious persons&nbsp;... including not a few ladies", according to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Richmond Murder|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=10 April 1879|page=6}}</ref> ''The Times'' reported that Webster's first appearance at Richmond magistrates' court was greeted by "an immense crowd yesterday around the building&nbsp;... and very great excitement prevailed."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Murder At Richmond|work=The Times|date=1 April 1879|page=5}}</ref>

Kate Webster went on trial at the Central Criminal Court&nbsp;<U+2013> the Old Bailey&nbsp;<U+2013> on 2 July 1879. In a sign of the great public interest aroused by the case, the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General, Sir [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Hardinge Gifford]]. Webster was defended by a prominent London barrister, Warner Sleigh, and the case was presided over by Mr. [[George Denman|Justice Denman]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gaute|Odell|1983|page=87}}</ref> The trial was just as well-attended as the earlier hearings in Richmond and attracted the intense interest of London society; on the fourth day of the trial, the Crown Prince of [[Sweden]] <U+2013> the future King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]] <U+2013> turned up to watch the proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Richmond Murder|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=6 July 1879|page=6}}</ref>

Over the course of six days, the court heard a succession of witnesses piecing together the complicated story of how Mrs. Thomas had met her death. Webster had attempted before the trial to implicate the publican John Church and her former neighbour Porter, but both men had solid alibis and were cleared of any involvement in the murder.<ref name="D'Cruze55">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=55}}</ref> She pleaded not guilty and her defence sought to emphasise the circumstantial nature of the evidence and highlighted her devotion to her son as a reason why she could not have been capable of the murder.<ref name="Conley">{{harvnb|Conley|2006|pp=84<U+2013>5}}</ref> However, Webster's public unpopularity, impassive demeanour and scanty defence counted strongly against her.<ref name="D'Cruze55" /> A particularly damning piece of evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her a week before the murder and had said that she was going to [[Birmingham]] to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder<ref name="Wilson198">{{harvnb|Wilson|1971|page=198}}</ref> and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.<ref name="Rudd97">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=97}}</ref>

Shortly after the jury returned its verdict and just before the judge was about to pass sentence, Webster was asked if there was any reason why sentence of death should not be passed upon her. She pleaded that she was pregnant in an apparent bid to avoid the death penalty.<ref name="Rudd98">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=98}}</ref> ''The Law Times'' reported that "[u]pon this a scene of uncertainty, if not of confusion, ensued, certainly not altogether in harmony with the solemnity of the occasion." The judge commented that "after thirty-two years in the profession, he was never at an inquiry of this sort." Eventually the [[Clerk of Assize]] suggested using the archaic mechanism of a [[jury of matrons]], constituted from a selection of the women attending the court, to rule upon the question of whether Webster was "with quick child".<ref name="Rudd99">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=99}}</ref> 12 women were sworn in along with a surgeon named Bond, and they accompanied Webster to a private room for an examination that only took a couple of minutes.<ref name="Rudd100">{{harvnb|Rudd|1916|page=100}}</ref> They returned a verdict that Webster was not "quick with child", though this did not necessarily mean that she was not pregnant&nbsp;<U+2013> a distinction that led the president of the Obstetrical Society of London to protest at the use of "the obsolete medical assumption that the unborn child is not alive until the so-called '[[quickening]].'"<ref>{{harvnb|Oldman|2006|pp=110<U+2013>1}}</ref>

A few days before Webster was due to be executed an appeal was submitted on her behalf to the [[Home Secretary]], [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R. A. Cross]]. It was turned down with an official statement that after considering the arguments put forward, the Home Secretary had "failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising [[Queen Victoria|Her Majesty]] to interfere with the due course of the law."<ref name="O'Donnell66">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=66}}</ref>

Before she was executed, Kate Webster made two statements confessing to the crime. In her first, she implicated Strong, the father of her child, whom she said had participated in the murder and was responsible for leading her into a life of crime. She recanted on 28 July, the night before she was due to be executed, making a further statement in which she took sole responsibility and exonerated Church, Porter and Strong of any involvement.<ref name="Wilson198" /> She was hanged the following day at Wandsworth Prison at 9 am, with the hangman [[William Marwood]] using his newly developed "[[Hanging#Long_drop|long drop]]" technique to cause instantaneous death.<ref>{{harvnb|Bailey|1993|page=100}}</ref> After her death was certified, she was buried in an unmarked grave in one of the prison's exercise yards.<ref>{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|page=232}}</ref> The crowd waiting outside cheered as a black flag was raised over the prison walls, signifying that the death sentence had been carried out.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Richmond Murder|work=Illustrated Police News|location=London|date=2 August 1879|page=4}}</ref>

An auction of Mrs. Thomas's property was held at 2 Mayfield Cottages on the day after Webster's execution. John Church, the publican, managed to obtain Mrs. Thomas's furniture after all, along with numerous other personal effects including her pocket-watch and the knife with which Mrs. Thomas had been dismembered. The copper in which Mrs. Thomas's body had been boiled was sold for five shillings.<ref name="O'Donnell73">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=73}}</ref> Other visitors contented themselves with taking small pebbles and twigs from the garden as souvenirs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sale of Mrs. Thomas's effects|work=Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper|date=3 August 1879|page=8}}</ref> The house itself remained unoccupied until 1897, as nobody would live there after the murder. Even then, according to the occupant, servants were reluctant to work at such a notorious place.<ref name="O'Donnell82">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=82}}</ref>

==Social impact of the murder==
[[File:Execution of Catherine Webster at Wandsworth Gaol.jpg|Right|thumb|alt=Illustration headlined "Execution of Catherine Webster at Wandsworth Gaol", showing a number of scenes including "the prisoner visited by her friends", "the process of pinioning", the final rites being said, "hoisting the black flag" and finally "filling up the coffin with lime"|Kate Webster's execution, as depicted by a souvenir illustration in the ''Illustrated Police News''.]]
The murder had a considerable social impact on Victorian Britain. It caused an immediate sensation and was widely reported in the press. ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'' of Dublin noted that what it called "one of the most sensational and awful chapters in the annals of human wickedness" had resulted in the press "teem[ing] with descriptions and details of the ghastly horrors of that crime".<ref name="Freemans31Mar1879">{{cite news|title=The Barnes Mystery|work=Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser|location=Dublin, Ireland|date=31 March 1879}}</ref> Such was Kate Webster's notoriety that within only a few weeks of her arrest, and well before she had gone to trial<ref name="O'Donnell10" /> [[Madame Tussaud's]] created a wax effigy of her and put it on display for those who wished to see the "Richmond Murderess". It remained on display well into the twentieth century alongside other notorious killers such as [[Burke and Hare]] and [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Dr. Crippen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carver|2003|page=227}}</ref> Within days of her execution an enterprising publisher on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] rushed into print a souvenir booklet for the price of a penny, "The Life, Trial and Execution of Kate Webster", which was advertised as "compris[ing] Twenty Handsome Pages, containing her entire History, with Summing-up, Verdict, and interesting particulars, together with her last words, and a FULL-PAGE ENGRAVING of the EXECUTION&nbsp;<U+2013> Portraits, Illustrations &c."<ref>{{cite news|title=Advertisement|work=The Illustrated Police News|date=9 August 1879|page=8}}</ref> The ''[[Illustrated Police News]]'' published a souvenir cover depicting an artist's impression of the day of the execution. It depicted "the prisoner visited by her friends", "the process of pinioning", the final rites being said, "hoisting the black flag" and finally "filling up the coffin with lime".<ref>{{cite news|title=Execution of Catherine Webster at Wandsworth Gaol|work=The Illustrated Police News|date=2 August 1879|page=1}}</ref>

Webster herself was characterised as malicious, reckless and wilfully evil.<ref name="D'Cruze52">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=52}}</ref> Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants were expected to be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern.<ref name="D'Cruze55" /> Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Mrs. Thomas's furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.<ref name="D'Cruze56">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=56}}</ref>

Another cause of revulsion against Webster was her attempt to impersonate Mrs. Thomas. She had managed to perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted to little more than cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.<ref name="D'Cruze55" />
[[File:Kate Webster sketch.png|left|thumb|alt=Sketch drawing of a dark-haired woman wearing a fur collar and a small hat decorated with a bow and feather.|Kate Webster's appearance (depicted here by ''The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times'') was a topic of comment in the press.]]
Perhaps most disturbingly for many Victorians, Webster was seen as having violated the expected norms of femininity. Victorian ideals saw women as moral, passive and physically weak or restrained.<ref name="D'Cruze56" /> Webster was seen as quite the opposite and was described in lurid ways that emphasised her lack of femininity. Elliott O'Donnell, writing in his introduction to the trial transcript, described Webster as "not merely savage, savage and shocking... [[but]] the grimmest of grim personalities, a character so uniquely sinister and barbaric as to be hardly human".<ref name="O'Donnell2">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=2}}</ref> The newspapers described her as "gaunt, repellent, and trampish-looking", though the reporter for ''The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times'' commented that she was "not so ill-favoured as she has been described."<ref name="O'Donnell11">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=11}}</ref>

Webster's appearance and behaviour were seen as key signs of her inherently criminal nature. Crimes were thought to be committed by a social "residuum" at the bottom of society who occupied themselves as "habitual criminals", choosing to live a lifestyle of drink and theft rather than improving themselves through thrift and hard work.<ref name="D'Cruze56" /> Her strong build, the result of the hard physical labour that was her livelihood, ran counter to the largely middle-class notion that women were meant to be physically frail.<ref name="D'Cruze57">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=57}}</ref> Some commentators saw her facial features as indicative of criminality; O'Donnell commented upon her "obliquely set eyes", which he declared "are not infrequently found in homicides&nbsp;... this peculiarity, which I consider was sufficient in itself, as one of nature's danger signals, to have warned people to steer clear of her".<ref name="O'Donnell12">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|1925|page=12}}</ref>

Webster's behaviour in court and her sexual history also counted against her. She was widely described by reporters as "calm" and "stolid" in facing the court<ref name="D'Cruze57" /> and only cried once during the trial, when her son was mentioned.<ref name="D'Cruze58">{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|page=58}}</ref> This contradicted the expectation that "properly feminine" women should be penitent and emotional in such a situation.<ref name="D'Cruze57" /> Her succession of male friends, one of whom had fathered her child outside wedlock, suggested promiscuous female sexuality&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;again, strongly counter to expected norms of behaviour.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|pp=57<U+2013>8}}</ref> During her trial she attempted unsuccessfully to evoke sympathy by blaming Strong, the father of her child, for leading her astray: "I formed an intimate acquaintance with one who should have protected me and [[was]] led away by evil associates and bad companions."<ref name="D'Cruze58" /> This claim played on social expectations that women's moral sense was inextricably linked with sexual chastity&nbsp;<U+2013> "falling" sexually would lead to other forms of "ruin"&nbsp;<U+2013> and that men who had sexual relations with women acquired social obligations that they were expected to fulfil.<ref name="D'Cruze58" /> Webster's attempt to implicate three innocent men also caused outrage; O'Donnell commented that "public opinion, as a whole, undoubtedly condemned Kate Webster, as much, perhaps, for her attempts to bring three innocent men to the scaffold as for the actual murder itself".<ref name="O'Donnell66" />

According to [[Shani D'Cruze]] of the Feminist Crime Research Network, the fact that she was Irish was a significant factor in the widespread revulsion felt towards Webster in Great Britain. Many Irish people had emigrated to England since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1849, but met widespread prejudice and persistent associations with criminality and drunkenness. The Irish were at worst depicted as bestial and subhuman, and there were repeated episodes of violence between Irish and English workers as well as attacks by [[Fenians]] (Irish nationalists) in England. The demonisation of Webster as "hardly human", as O'Donnell put it, was of a piece with the public and judicial perceptions of the Irish as innately criminal.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Cruze|Walklate|Pegg|2006|pp=56<U+2013>7}}</ref>

==Discovery of Julia Martha Thomas's skull==

In 1952, the naturalist David Attenborough and his wife Jane bought a house situated between the former Mayfield Cottages (which still stand today) and the ''Hole in the Wall'' pub.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Giles|title=What comes naturally|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4729076/What-comes-naturally.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=31 December 2001|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> The pub closed in 2007 and fell into dereliction but was bought by Attenborough in 2009 to be redeveloped.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Laura|title=Sir David foils developers <U+2013> by buying the pub next door|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-1189736/Sir-David-foils-developers--buying-pub-door.html|work=The Daily Mail|location=London|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

On 22 October 2010, workmen carrying out excavation work at the rear of the old pub uncovered a "dark circular object", which turned out to be a woman's skull. It had been buried underneath foundations that had been in place for at least 40 years, on the site of the pub's stables. It was immediately speculated that the skull was the missing head of Julia Martha Thomas, and the coroner asked Richmond police to carry out an investigation into the identity and circumstances of death of the skull's owner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Christine|title=Inquest opens into skull found in Sir David Attenborough's garden|url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/8476217.Inquest_opens_into_skull_found_in_Sir_David_s_garden/|date=26 October 2010|work=Richmond and Twickenham Times|location=Richmond|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Carbon dating carried out at the [[University of Edinburgh]] found that it was dated between 1650 and 1880, but it had been deposited on top of a layer of Victorian tiles. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Kate Webster's account of throwing Mrs. Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low [[collagen]] levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Mrs. Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|title=Head found in David Attenborough's garden was murder victim|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8618240/Head-found-in-David-Attenboroughs-garden-was-murder-victim.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> A verdict of [[unlawful killing]] was recorded, superseding the open verdict recorded in 1879, and the cause of death was given as asphyxiation and a head injury. According to the police, the outcome was "a good example of how good old-fashioned detective work, historical records and technological advances came together to solve the <U+2018>Barnes mystery<U+2019>."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14034969|title='Barnes mystery' of Attenborough garden skull solved|publisher=BBC News|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>
