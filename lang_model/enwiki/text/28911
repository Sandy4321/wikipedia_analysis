'''Coast Guard Squadron One''' was a combat unit formed by the [[United States Coast Guard]] in 1965 under the operational control of the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and assigned duties in [[Operation Market Time]]. Its formation marked the first time since World War II that Coast Guard personnel were used in a combat environment.
  
The squadron operated divisions in three separate areas during the period of 1965 to 1970. Twenty six [[Point-class cutter]]s with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the [[South China Sea]] into [[South Vietnam]] by [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnam]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]] and [[Naval trawler|trawler]] operators. The squadron also provided [[naval gunfire support]] to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnam coastline and assisted the Navy during [[Operation Sealords]]. As United States direct involvement in combat operations wound down during 1969, squadron crews began training [[South Vietnamese Navy]] (SVN) sailors in the operation and deployment of the cutters. The cutters were later turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy as part of the [[Vietnamization]] of the war effort. Turnover of the cutters to South Vietnamese crews began in May 1969 and was completed by August 1970 and Squadron One was disestablished with the decommissioning of the last cutter.

The squadron was awarded several unit citations for its service to the Navy and the South Vietnamese government during the six years the unit was active with over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen serving aboard cutters and on the squadron support staff. Six squadron members were killed in action during the time the unit was commissioned.

Squadron One, along with Navy and SVN units assigned to the task force that assumed the Market Time mission were successful interdicting seaborne North Vietnamese personnel and equipment from entering South Vietnamese waters. The success of the blockade served to change the dynamics of the Vietnam War, forcing the North Vietnamese to use a more costly and time consuming route down the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] to supply their forces in the south.

==Background==

As the United States military involvement in South Vietnam shifted from an advisory role to combat operations, [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) advisors to the South Vietnamese government noticed an increase in the amount of military supplies and weapons being smuggled into the county by way of North Vietnamese junks and other small craft.<ref name=Larzelere6>Larzelere, p 6</ref><ref name=SummersJr.100>Summers, p 100</ref> The extent of infiltration was underscored in February 1965 by the detection of a North Vietnamese trawler disguised as an "island" by a [[United States Army]] helicopter crew.<ref name=Tulich3>Tulich, p 3</ref> The event would later be known as the [[Vung Ro Bay Incident]], named for the small bay that was the trawler's destination.<ref name=Kelley5-541>Kelley, sec 5, p 541</ref><ref name=Cutler76>Cutler, p 76</ref> After the Army helicopter crew called in air strikes on the trawler, it was sunk and captured after a five-day action conducted by elements of the South Vietnamese Navy (SVN). Investigators found 1 million rounds of small arms ammunition, more than 1,000 stick grenades, 500 pounds of prepared [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] charges, 2,000 rounds of 82mm mortar ammunition, 500 anti-tank grenades, 1,500 rounds of recoilless rifle ammunition, 3,600 rifles and sub-machine guns, and 500 pounds of medical supplies.<ref name="Cutler76" />  Labels on captured equipment and supplies and other papers found in the wreckage indicated that the shipment was from North Vietnam. Concern by top MACV advisors as to whether the SVN was up to the task of interdicting shipments originating in North Vietnam led to the request by General [[William C. Westmoreland]], commanding general of MACV, for Navy assistance.<ref name=Karnow346>Karnow, p 346</ref>

The request for the Navy to provide surveillance and interdiction was initially filled by Navy radar picket [[destroyer escort]]s (DER) and [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s (MSO) in March 1965 when Operation Market Time was started; however it soon became apparent that these vessels had too great a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] to operate effectively in shallow coastal waters.<ref name=Johnson331>Johnson, p 331</ref> In April the Navy immediately ordered 54 [[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift boats]] (PCF); {{convert|50|foot|m|adj=on}} aluminum-hulled boats with a draft of only {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} and capable of {{convert|25|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|}}. At the same time, the Navy queried the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], the lead agency for the Coast Guard at the time, about the availability of suitable vessels.<ref name=Cutler81>Cutler, p 81</ref><ref name=Larzelere7>Larzelere, p 7</ref> The Coast Guard had only a  very minor role in combat operations during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]], Admiral [[Edwin J. Roland]], responded to the request by offering the use of {{convert|82|foot|m|adj=on}} Point-class cutters (WPB) and {{convert|40|foot|m|adj=on}} utility boats, fearing that if the Coast Guard were left out of a role in Vietnam that its status as one of the nation's [[United States Armed Forces|armed services]] might be jeopardized.<ref name="Johnson331" />

The decision to use the Point-class cutter was one of logistics. The {{convert|95|foot|m|adj=on}} [[Cape-class cutter]] was initially considered an option by Roland since it had a greater speed because of its four main drive engines. The Point-class cutter had only two main drive engines but they were more consistent throughout the class than the Cape-class cutters, thus making it easier to maintain a supply of spare parts and fewer engines to maintain.<ref name=Larzelere13>Larzelere, p 13</ref> Additional factors favoring the Point-class cutter were an unmanned engine room with all controls and alarms on the bridge and air-conditioned living spaces, a big factor with a tropical climate where crews were expected to live on the boat whether on or off duty.<ref name=Cutler82>Cutler, p 82</ref>  The 40-foot utility boats were rejected as not having the facilities for extended patrols offshore, no radar, and no berthing or messing facilities.<ref name="Larzelere13" />

On 22 April 1965, representatives of the Coast Guard and the Navy signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] where the Coast Guard would supply 17 Point-class cutters and their crews and the Navy would provide transport to South Vietnam and logistical support with two [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]s that had been converted to repair ships.<ref name="Johnson331" /><ref name=Larzelere8>Larzelere, p 8</ref> Ten of the cutters were sourced from stations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and seven were sourced from Pacific coast stations.  After removal of the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]] on the bow, each cutter was fitted with a combination over-under [[M2 Browning machine gun]]/[[M29 mortar|MK 2 trigger and drop-fired 81mm mortar]] and loaded on merchant ships for shipment to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=Johnson332>Johnson, p 332</ref><ref name=Wells>Wells II</ref> On 29 April President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] authorized Coast Guard units to operate under Navy command in Vietnam and to provide surveillance and interdiction assistance to Navy vessels and aircraft in an effort to stop the infiltration of troops, weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and [[Viet Cong]] (VC) forces.<ref name=Scotti9>Scotti, p 9</ref> The combined Navy, Coast Guard and South Vietnamese Navy effort was designated [[Operation Market Time]].<ref name="Johnson331" />

==Crew training and commissioning of Squadron One==
While the cutters were being shipped to Subic Bay, crew members started reporting to [[Coast Guard Island|Coast Guard Training Center Alameda]], California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training.<ref name=Larzelere18>Larzelere, p 18</ref> The cutter crews received one week of [[small arms]] training at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]] and [[Camp Pendleton]] while [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] (survival, evasion, resistance and escape) training was received at [[Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center]], near [[Coleville, California]], in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and at [[Whidbey Island Naval Air Station]], Washington.<ref name=Larzelere19>Larzelere, p 19</ref> Returning to Alameda, they underwent refresher firefighting and [[damage control]] training from the Navy at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island Naval Base]]. Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises were held at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], along with refresher training in radar navigation, radio procedures and visual signaling. Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton.<ref name="Larzelere19" /> Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May 1965 with the remainder of the crews in the process of completing training elsewhere.<ref name="Johnson332" /><ref name="Larzelere18" /> For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the normal crew complement of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. All officers assigned to command cutters were required to have commanded a Cape-class cutter and had to volunteer for the assignment of commanding officer.<ref name=Larzelere15>Larzelere, p 15</ref>[[File:VTN 82s Loaded 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|USCGC ''Point Mast'' (WPB-82316) being loaded on board a merchant ship for shipment to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Philippines (May 1965)]]

==Naval Base Subic Bay==

===Divisions 11 and 12===

The first crews arrived at Subic Bay on 11 June and a squadron office was established. At 0001 hours, 12 June 1965 the squadron came under the operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard.<ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref> The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the [[waterline]] down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and [[ready service ammunition|ammunition ready boxes]] for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the [[mess]] deck and adding more sound-powered telephone circuits.<ref name="Larzelere21" /> Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol [[nautical stationkeeping|on station]] time.<ref name=Cutler83>Cutler, p 83</ref> Modifications were made to the bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the [[gunwale]]s of each cutter.<ref name="Larzelere21" />
[[File:VTN SQ1 Subic.jpg|thumb|left|200px|USCGC ''Point Marone'' (WPB-82331) leaving Subic Bay Naval Base for Vietnam along with other cutters of Division 11, 24 July 1965]]
As the crews arrived from the United States, they began required modification work in the shipyard and doing [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] [[sorties]] in an effort to get all systems working. Night training exercises and gunnery drills were held each day and underway drills and training had been completed and [[commissary]] stores loaded by 9 July.<ref name=Larzelere22>Larzelere, p 22</ref> A one day survival training course was conducted by [[Negrito]] natives and completion was compulsory for all squadron personnel.<ref name="Larzelere22" /> When it became known that the cutters would be operating in two widely separated locations, Squadron One was divided into two divisions with Division 11 operating in the Gulf of Thailand at An Thoi, [[Phu Quoc Island]]<ref name="Kelley5-400" /> and Division 12 operating near the port of [[Da Nang]]<ref name="Kelley5-129" /> close to the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ).<ref name="Larzelere21" /><ref name=Kelley5-142>Kelley, sec 5, p 142</ref>  Division 11 consisted of nine cutters and a Navy support ship and Division 12 consisted of 8 cutters. With crew training completed and equipment checked, all that remained was for the order to form up and leave Subic Bay. At 1600 16 July 1965 Division 12 got underway accompanied by the music of ''[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]'' transmitted over the radio circuit by the crew of Division 11 cutter {{USCGC|Point Banks|WPB-82327|2}}.<ref name="Larzelere22" /> Once out of the harbor they formed up on {{ship|USS|Snohomish County|LST-1125|6}}, the LST assigned to support the division during the transit to Da Nang. Division 11 left Subic Bay bound for Phu Quoc Island at 0800 24 July with the support of {{ship|USS|Floyd County|LST-762|6}}.<ref name="Larzelere22" />

After reviewing a study of the overall infiltration threat, MACV requested additional aircraft and patrol vessels for Operation Market Time. A request for an additional division of Point-class cutters to be added to Squadron One was made on 5 August 1965 and preparations for deploying the additions cutters started in late October with the new division of nine patrol boats to be named Division 13.<ref name=Larzelere72>Larzelere, p 72</ref> The staff and repair personnel arrived at Subic Bay 14 December 1965 while the boat crews of the division received weapons and survival training in California. The crews started arriving at Subic Bay on 28 December where additional survival and weapons training was given.<ref name=Larzelere74>Larzelere, p 74</ref> Twenty one of the division's personnel were sent to Divisions 11 and 12 to be exchanged with crewmen who had Vietnam experience.<ref name="Larzelere74" /> Division 13 cutters began arriving as deck cargo on transport ships on 24 January 1966 and crews commenced outfitting and painting them deck gray. Some of the outfitting had been accomplished before shipment so that more time could be devoted to training crews in gunnery and procedure before the division's scheduled departure for Vietnam on 18 February.<ref name="Larzelere74" /> During a training exercise on 13 February, the main engine alarm sounded on the bridge of {{USCGC|Point League|WPB-82304|2}}.  After checking the cause of the alarm, it was determined that a complete overhaul of one of the engines would be required. Division 12 at Da Nang shipped a complete kit of repair parts by way of a [[Marine Corps]] [[C-130]] flight to [[Cubi Point Naval Air Station]] overnight. The flight was met by division personnel and repairs were done in a three-shift, around-the-clock basis, and was completed in 72 hours.<ref name=Larzelere75>Larzelere, p 75</ref> A partial load [[Break-in (mechanical run-in)|break-in]] was made the morning of departure and the rest of the break-in procedure was done while the division was in route to Vietnam.<ref name=Larzelere76>Larzelere, p 76</ref> At 1600 18 February, Division 13 left Subic Bay in the company of {{USS|Forster|DER-334|6}}, arriving at the Vietnamese Navy Base at [[Cat Lo]] on 22 February.<ref name="Kelley5-95" /><ref name=Scotti16>Scotti, p 16</ref> Patrol work for six of the Division 13 cutters began at 0800 the following morning, covering the area from {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} north of [[Vung Tau]] to {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} south.<ref name=Larzelere77>Larzelere, p 77</ref>

==Operations==

===Arrival in Vietnam===
Division 12 arrived at the port city of Da Nang at 0700 20 July 1965 and was the first Coast Guard unit to be stationed in Vietnam.<ref name=Larzelere28>Larzelere, p 28</ref> The morning after their arrival five of the eight cutters prepared to get underway for their first patrol accompanied by the Navy destroyer {{USS|Savage|DER-386|6}} which coordinated the Market Time assets in the Da Nang area.
Division 11 arrived at [[Con Son Island]]<ref name=Kelley5-116>Kelley, sec 5, p 116</ref> on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had developed during the transit. ''Point Banks'' was the only cutter to have engine problems during the transit and repairs were made in the cramped engine room while underway so that no time was lost by the division during transit. During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutter's hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. At Con Son, three SVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three cutters started patrol work as the rest of the division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July.<ref name=Larzelere48>Larzelere, p 48</ref> On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements, whether Navy, Coast Guard or South Vietnamese Navy was transferred to Commander, Task Force 115 (TF115).<ref name=Cutler85>Cutler, p 85</ref>

===Market Time operational theory===
{{Main|Operation Market Time}}
Market Time planners sectioned off nine patrol areas numbered in order from the [[Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) in the north to the Cambodian border in the south. The areas varied in size, measuring {{convert|80|x|120|mi|km}} and running {{convert|30|to|40|mi|km}} out to sea. The outer two-thirds of each area was covered by the Navy DER and MSO fleet and was identified by the area number with the suffix "B". After May 1967 [[Coast Guard Squadron Three]] high endurance cutters (WHEC) also assisted in the outer patrol areas.<ref name=USCGcron3>{{cite web|title=USCG in Vietnam Chronology|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/USCGVietnamChronology.pdf|work=U.S. Coast Guard History Program|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard Historians Office|format=pdf|page=3|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Because the inner third of each patrol area was usually shallow water it was covered by Navy PCFs and Coast Guard WPBs which had shallow drafts. These smaller patrol areas were identified by a letter "C" or higher. Thus, the patrol area covering the waters near [[Cam Ranh Bay]]<ref name=Kelley5-83>Kelley, sec 5, p 83</ref> would have the outer two-thirds designated "4B" and the waters nearer shore designated "4C" through "4H".<ref name=Scotti19>Scotti, p 19</ref> Overflying the whole area were Navy patrol aircraft that flew various assigned tracks, reporting any traffic to watchstanders stationed at five Coastal Surveillance Centers (CSC) operated jointly by the Navy and South Vietnamese Navy. Reports of movements by suspicious vessels were relayed to the nearest Market Time patrol craft whose duty it was to [[Boarding (attack)#In peacetime|board]] and search for contraband material and persons on board with out proper identification.<ref name=Larzelere37>Larzelere, p 37</ref> The [[rules of engagement]] that Market Time forces operated under allowed any vessel except warships to be stopped, boarded and searched within three miles (4.8 km) of the coastline and from the area three miles to twelve miles (19.4 km) from shore, identification and a declaration of intent could be demanded of any vessel except a warship. Outside the twelve mile limit only vessels of South Vietnamese origin could be stopped, boarded and searched.<ref name=USNOVH0366>{{cite web|title=United States Naval Operations Vietnam, Highlights; March 1966|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/vietnam/high66-3.html|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|accessdate=17 June 2011|author=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|month=November|year=2006}}</ref><ref name=Scotti18>Scotti, p 18</ref>

While on patrol the cutters operated under orders from an operational commander at the CSC and not the division commander to which they were assigned.<ref name=Larzelere34>Larzelere, p 34</ref><ref name=Scotti173>Scotti, p 173</ref> The division was responsible for seeing that each cutter was ready to perform her assignments and properly supplied with trained personnel, supplies and equipment.<ref name="Larzelere34" /> Each division's staff performed regular readiness reviews on each assigned cutter; riding with the crews to judge their effectiveness.<ref name="Scotti173" />

On 30 September 1968, Vice Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt|Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr]]. assumed command of Naval Forces Vietnam and he redirected the focus of interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas nearer the DMZ as a part of [[Operation Sealords|Operation SEALORDS]]. (Southeast Asia Lake, Ocean, River, and Delta Strategy). The result was that all but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.<ref name=Larzelere66>Larzelere, p 66</ref>

===Major cutter operations===

====1965====
[[File:VTN Mortar Color Firing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gun crew on board USCGC ''Point Comfort'' (WPB-82317) firing 81mm mortar during bombardment of suspected Viet Cong staging area one mile behind An Thoi.(August 1965)]]
Soon after patrol operations started in the Division 12 area of responsibility (AOR), {{USCGC|Point Orient|WPB-82319|2}} encountered machine gun and mortar fire from the shore south of the Cua Viet River while attempting to board a [[junk (ship)|junk]] in the early morning hours of 24 July 1965; thus becoming the first Coast Guard unit in Vietnam to engage the enemy.<ref name=Larzelere31>Larzelere, p 31</ref> It was obvious to the [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] of the ''Point Orient'' that the stateside paint scheme used by the Coast Guard was too visible at night and shortly thereafter the white paint was replaced by deck gray on all WPBs in Squadron One.<ref name="Cutler85" />  On assuming control, The TF115 commander changed the way patrols were conducted in the DMZ. Future patrols were concentrated along the DMZ for most of the WPBs and PCFs with only a few assets placed in the Da Nang area. Assets were concentrated where vessel traffic was encountered; most traffic near the Da Nang area was interdicted further out to sea by the DER's and WHEC's and fewer shallow draft assets were needed there.<ref name="Larzelere31" /><ref name=Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref>

19 September was a busy day for Division 11 in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] with {{USCGC|Point Glover|WPB-82307|2}} encountering a junk that fired on her and when unable to escape tried to ram the cutter. The Viet Cong crew jumped overboard and ''Point Glover'' disabled the junk's engine with machine gun fire. A boarding party from ''Point Glover'' boarded the sinking junk and did a quick search of the vessel, finding arms and ammunition. Unable to stop the junk from sinking, she was beached in shallow water while {{USCGC|Point Garnet|WPB-82310|2}},{{USCGC| Point Clear|WPB-82315|2}} and {{USCGC|Point Marone|WPB-82331|2}} went searching for the missing junk crew; however, only one crew member was captured.<ref name=Larzelere45>Larzelere, p 45</ref> Later that night ''Point Marone'' attempted to stop an unlit junk near the coastal town of [[Ha Tien]]<ref name=Kelley5-208>Kelley, sec 5, p 208</ref> but the junk ignored a [[warning shot]] across her bow and attempted to evade a boarding while firing at the cutter and throwing hand grenades. ''Point Glover'' was nearby and assisted ''Point Marone'' in engaging the junk with machine gun fire. The junk caught fire and started sinking. Unable to keep the junk afloat the cutter crews marked it with a buoy and let it sink in shallow water. Salvage operations conducted later found rifles, ammunition, hand grenades, documents and money.<ref name=Cutler112>Cutler, p 112</ref> Eleven Viet Cong were killed in action and one badly wounded crewman was captured ashore.<ref name="Larzelere45" />

====1966====
After Division 13's arrival at Cat Lo, 22 February 1966, operations started at nearby [[Rung Sat Special Zone]];<ref name=Kelley5-450>Kelley, sec 5, p 450</ref> an area of tidal [[mangrove]] swamp southeast of [[Saigon]] that straddled the [[L<U+00F2>ng T<U+00E0>u River]], the main shipping channel to the Port of Saigon. {{USCGC|Point White|WPB-82308|2}} was patrolling on the night of 9 March and intercepted a small junk attempting to smuggle supplies across the [[Soi Rap River]]. After hailing the junk and receiving automatic weapons fire in reply, the cutter returned fire and killed several Viet Cong. They continued to fire on ''Point White'' so the skipper ordered the helmsman to ram the junk [[amidships]] at full speed. All but four of the crew of the junk were killed.

Some of the most intense combat operations that Squadron One encountered occurred during the month of March 1966 in support of Operation Jackstay.<ref name="Larzelere83" /> The joint operation ended 6 April with the withdrawal of the Marine Amphibious Force but the skipper of ''Point Partridge'' decided to continue the patrols after the operation ended. On the night patrols from 1 May to 6 May ''Point Partridge'' engaged Viet Cong junks or received fire from the shore every night.<ref name="Larzelere83" />

While patrolling off the coast of the [[Ca Mau Peninsula]] in the late evening hours of 9 May 1966 {{USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|2}} reported sighting two large bonfires on the shore near the mouth of the [[Rach Gia River]]. Since this was an unusual activity the skipper decided to monitor the area for the remainder of the night. Shortly after midnight, a steel-hulled [[Naval trawler|trawler]] was spotted and challenged but ''Point Grey'' received no answer. The trawler continued on a course headed for the beach area near the bonfires and ran [[aground]] {{convert|400|yd|m}} from the shore.<ref name=CNFVMHS0566>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

After daybreak ''Point Grey'' attempted to board the trawler but encountered heavy fire from the shore. After requesting assistance from the CSC, ''Point Grey'' stood off from the trawler until {{USS|Brister|DER-327|6}} arrived on scene. With ''Brister'' standing in deeper water and [[South Vietnamese Air Force]] [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|A-1E Skyraider]] aircraft bombing the beach nearby, ''Point Grey'' attempted a boarding but she received very heavy small arms fire from Viet Cong positions beyond the beach which heavily damaged the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]] and wounded three of her crew manning the mortar on the bow.<ref name=Larzelere64>Larzelere, p 64</ref> With evening approaching it was decided by CSC to destroy the trawler and ''Point Grey'' assisted by {{USCGC|Point Cypress|WPB-82326|2}} began mortaring the trawler. During the shelling an explosion on board the trawler broke it two pieces and it sank in the shallow waters.  Salvage operations began the next morning and included the recovery of six crew served weapons and {{convert|15|ST|kg|}} of ammunition of Chinese manufacture.<ref name="CNFVMHS0566" /> The destruction of the trawler marked the first instance of the capture of a trawler by Market Time assets.<ref name=Larzelere61>Larzelere, p 61</ref><ref name=Scotti205>Scotti, p 205</ref>

While on patrol near the mouth of the [[Co Chien River]] in the early hours of 20 June, the [[Sea captain|skipper]] of ''Point League'' noted a large radar contact which, upon further investigation, was found to be running without lights. After informing the CSC of the situation the cutter went to [[general quarters]] and spotlighted the incoming trawler. The trawler ignored a hail from ''Point League'' and two bursts of machine gun fire across its bow.<ref name=Larzelere68>Larzelere, p 68</ref> The trawler returned with heavy machine gun fire hitting the cutter's bridge and wounding the executive officer and a crewman manning the mortar on the [[forecastle]]. The trawler dropped the line on a towed junk and picked up speed in an effort to beach along the shore. When the commanding officer of ''Point League'' noticed that the trawler was headed for [[shoal|shoal water]] near the mouth of the river, he let the trawler run aground {{convert|75|yd|m|0}} from shore and moved to a position {{convert|1000|yd|m|}} away while keeping the target illuminated with mortar rounds. ''Point League'' then came under fire from Viet Cong elements operating from just behind the shoreline. With assistance from ''Point Slocum'' the two cutters poured machine gun fire into the grounded trawler. Just after dawn the trawler was sunk by what was probably a [[scuttling charge]] resulting in a large fire. At 0715 the {{USS|Haverfield|DER-393|6}} arrived on scene and assumed control of the operation. With the assistance of two Air Force [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] aircraft, resistance from the shoreline was finally controlled. It was decided by the commanding officer of the ''Haverfield'' that salvage of the trawler would be attempted in order to learn more about the trawler, its origins and the cargo on board.<ref name=CNFVMHS0666>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

 {{Main|USCGC Point Welcome (WPB-82329)}}
[[File:VTN Pt Welcome 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|USCGC ''Point Welcome'' on patrol]]
''Point Welcome'' was patrolling Area 1A1 immediately south of the DMZ in the early morning hours of 11 August 1966. At 0340 the cutter was illuminated by an Air Force [[forward air controller]] (FAC) that mistook her for an enemy vessel. The FAC called in one [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] and two [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F4C]] aircraft which proceeded to strafe the cutter for about one hour, each making from seven to nine passes. ''Point Welcome'' turned on all of her running and docking lights when first illuminated by the FAC aircraft and contacted the CSC by radio telling them that they were being illuminated by aircraft. During the first pass all of the crew on the bridge were wounded and the commanding officer Lieutenant Junior Grade David Brostrom was killed along with the helmsman, Engineman Second Class Jerry Phillips.<ref name=USCG02>{{cite web|title=U.S. Coast Guardsmen Killed in Action during the Vietnam Conflict|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/VietnamKIA.asp|work=Coast Guard History Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=US Coast Guard Historians Office|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref> All signaling equipment, electronics and radios were knocked out on the first pass. ''Point Welcome'' began evasive maneuvers at the direction of Chief Boatswains Mate Richard Patterson, who had assumed command after the executive officer was seriously injured. Patterson attempted to avoid the illumination lights of the attacking aircraft and move out of the way of the strafing aircraft. At 0415 Patterson decided that the best course of action was to beach the cutter and move the wounded ashore, however when this was attempted, the crew came under fire from unknown sources from the shoreline. At 0425 ''Point Orient'' and {{USCGC|Point Caution|WPB-82301|2}} arrived on the scene and started rescue proceedings. In addition to the commanding officer, one other crewman was killed, nine other crewmen were injured along with a SVN liaison officer and civilian free lance journalist [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]]. The bridge of the cutter was severely damaged and there were nine holes {{convert|5|to|9|in|cm}} in diameter in the main deck but the hull was undamaged. ''Point Welcome'' was escorted back to Da Nang under her own power and required three months to repair the damage.<ref name=CNFVMHS0866>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

====1967====
In the late evening hours of 1 January 1967 {{USCGC|Point Gammon|WPB-82328|2}} and two Navy PCFs intercepted a trawler attempting to land supplies on the Cau Mau Peninsula. After running the trawler aground the PCFs managed to hit it with several mortar rounds while ''Point Gammon'' kept the trawler illuminated. Several secondary explosions occurred, however the trawler successfully escaped although heavily damaged.<ref name=CNFVMHS0167>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

A more successful conclusion occurred in the early morning hours of 14 March 1967 when a Navy patrol aircraft spotted a trawler near [[Cu-Lao Re Group|Cu Lao Re]], an island {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of Da Nang.<ref name=Kelley5-125>Kelley, sec 5, p 125</ref> USS ''Brister'' and two PCFs along with {{USCGC|Point Ellis|WPB-82330|2}} closed on the trawler and forced it aground near the village of Phouc Thien on [[Batangan Peninsula|Cape Batangan]].<ref name=Kelley5-44>Kelley, sec 5, p 44</ref> The patrol elements continued to exchange heavy gunfire with the trawler and land-based Viet Cong units until dawn when the trawler was scuttled with a massive explosion. Investigators later discovered a heavy machine gun, a recoilless rifle, sub-machine guns, rifles and carbines along with thousands of rounds of ammunition. Also in the wreckage was a complete surgical kit for a field hospital and medical supplies.<ref name=CNFVMHS0367>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

A similar conclusion was the result of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket, {{USS|Wilhoite|DER-397|6}}.<ref name=CNFVMHS0767>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

At 0200 15 July, the trawler was boxed in and ran aground {{convert|200|yd|m}} from shore and the trawler was ablaze. [[Republic of Korea]] Marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 0600 with the trawler apparently abandoned, a Navy demolitions expert from ''Walker'' boarded the trawler and defused 2,000 pounds of [[TNT]] charges that were designed to scuttle the craft.<ref name="CNFVMHS0767" /> Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, mortar and rocket rounds, anti-personnel mines, grenades, and several thousand pounds of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] plastic explosive and TNT.

On many occasions during the months of October, November and December 1967, the cutters ''Point Hudson'', {{USCGC|Point Jefferson|WPB-82306|2}}, {{USCGC|Point Grace|WPB-82323|2}} and ''Point Gammon'' were called on to assist in naval gunfire support missions in the Long Toan and Thanh Phu Secret Zones near [[Soc Trang]].<ref name=Kelley5-304>Kelley, sec 5, p 304</ref><ref name=Kelley5-502>Kelley, sec 5, p 502</ref>   These missions resulted in the destruction of several sampans and structures as well as bunkers used by the Viet Cong.<ref name=CNFVMHS1067>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

====1968====
During the morning hours of 31 January 1968, combined forces of North Vietnamese Army/Viet Cong personnel initiated coordinated attacks on military installations throughout South Vietnam in what would be later be referred to as the "[[Tet Offensive]]". Because of monsoon weather in the northern provinces of South Vietnam and a general [[curfew]] imposed by the South Vietnamese government on most sampan traffic, routine boardings by Squadron One vessels during February were far below normal.<ref name=CNFVMHS0268>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary. February 1968|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/docs/comnavforv/1968/February1968.pdf|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|accessdate=30 December 2011|author=Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam|pages=1&ndash;20|format=pdf|month=February|year=1968}}</ref> However, requests for naval gunfire support by land based Army and Marine units increased significantly after "Tet". The cutters ''Point Gammon'', {{USCGC|Point Arden|WPB-82309|2}}, ''Point Grey'', ''Point Cypress'', ''Point League'', and {{USCGC|Point Slocum|WPB-82313|2}} were involved in multiple naval gunfire support missions throughout the month of February.<ref name="CNFVMHS0268" /> The use of Squadron One cutters as a blocking force against exfiltration by NVA/VC forces operating along the coastline also increased at this time.<ref name="CNFVMHS0268" />

 {{Main|Action of 1 March 1968}}
In the early morning hours of 1 March 1968, several Squadron One cutters were involved in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, South Vietnamese Navy junks, Air Force aircraft, Army helicopters, Coast Guard Squadron Three cutters {{Ship|USCGC|Androscoggin|WHEC-68|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Winona|WHEC-65|2}}, and {{Ship|USCGC|Minnetonka|WHEC-67|2}}; and Squadron One cutters ''Point Grey'', ''Point Hudson'', and ''Point Welcome''.<ref name="CNFVMHS0268" /> As a result of this action, three of the North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments through the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] or through the port of [[Sihanoukville]] in Cambodia.<ref name="SummersJr.100" />

While on patrol just south of the [[DMZ]] in the early morning hours of 16 June 1968 {{USCGC|Point Dume|WPB-82325|2}} reported seeing two rockets fired from an unidentified source hit the Navy swift boat, ''PCF-19'' which sank very quickly with the loss of five of the crew.<ref name=Cutler114>Cutler, p 114</ref> Shortly thereafter, ''Point Dume'' came under fire from an unidentified aircraft along with the heavy cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69|6}} and the Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|6}}. The duration of the attack was about one hour with little damage to the cutter and ''Boston'' but considerable damage to ''Hobart'' and injury to several of her crew.

Operations conducted by [[South Vietnamese Regional Force]] troops on Phu Quoc Island in September were assisted by Market Time assets. {{USCGC|Point Partridge|WPB-82305|2}} and ''Point Banks'' assisted with naval gunfire support on 9 September which destroyed three bunkers, killing four and wounding several others.

Small boats from the cutters helped evacuate wounded Regional Forces troops.<ref name="CNFVMHS0968" />

Heavy weather in the form of monsoons in the northern half of South Vietnam cut indigenous coastal traffic down during October 1968 and the Navy's swift boat support of Market Time was limited by heavy seas; however Market Time units including Squadron One cutters fired a record number of naval gunfire missions for the sixth month in a row. The 1,027 missions conducted during October was 19 percent higher than the previous record.<ref name=CNFVMHS1068>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

Additionally, a landing party helped to destroy 41 sampans in the aftermath that had been used to transport Viet Cong supplies.<ref name="CNFVMHS0369" />

The first turnover of Squadron One cutters occurred on 16 May with the transfer of ''Point League'' and ''Point Garnet'' to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan. An elaborate ceremony was held at the SVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the turnover of the two cutters.<ref name=Scotti187>Scotti, p 187</ref> On 5 June, Division 11 was disestablished and its cutters were transferred to Division 13.<ref name=Larzelere234>Larzelere, p 234</ref> The need for Squadron One cutters had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and PBRs that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation SEALORDS.

With the growing dissatisfaction of the American electorate about Vietnam in 1969, high officials in the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon Administration]] sought a way to disengage the United States from the war.<ref name=Larzelere229>Larzelere, p 229</ref><ref name=Mann642>Mann, p 642</ref>
Part of the strategy to placate public opinion was termed "Vietnamization" and it included plans to remove most U.S. combat troops from Vietnam and the turnover of supplies and equipment to the South Vietnamese military.<ref name=Karnow593>Karnow, p 593</ref><ref name=Mann644>Mann, p 644</ref><ref name=Sorley166>Sorley, p 166</ref> Other parts of the plan, referred to as Accelerated Turnover to Vietnamese (ACTOV), included the training of Vietnamese in the use of equipment that was to be turned over to them and a gradual phase-in of responsibilities for the conduct of the war by the South Vietnamese government.<ref name="Larzelere229" /><ref name=Karnow595>Karnow, p 595</ref><ref name=Mann652>Mann, p 652</ref> The first assets turned over to the Vietnamese under ACTOV occurred 1 February 1969 when 25 mostly smaller U.S. Navy vessels were transferred to the South Vietnamese Navy to be used in supporting Operation SEALORDS in the Mekong Delta.<ref name=CNFVMHS0269>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary.

===ACTOV===
The naval assets portion of the ACTOV plan consisted of two parts: SCATTOR (Small Craft Assets, Training, and Turnover of Resources) and VECTOR (Vietnamese Engineering Capability, Training of [[Naval rating|Rating]]s). While SCATTOR trained Vietnamese replacement crews for the patrol boats of Squadron One, VECTOR trained and prepared Vietnamese repair personnel to maintain them.<ref name=Larzelere230>Larzelere, p 230</ref>

====Background====
Since the patrol boats of Squadron One were an essential part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese Navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all Navy resources to the South Vietnamese by 30 June 1970.<ref name="Larzelere229" /> Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use.<ref name="Larzelere230" /> The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.<ref name="Larzelere230" /><ref name=Scotti185>Scotti, p 185</ref>

On 3 February 1969 the first South Vietnamese Navy officers reported aboard ''Point Garnet'' and ''Point League'' for an 18 week pilot training program. Each cutter's executive officer was relieved and assigned staff duties ashore with the commanding officer assuming his duties.  The two spare bunks on each cutter were utilized by the new Vietnamese personnel reporting on board. As experience was gained by the Vietnamese crew members, new junior personnel reported in pairs replacing Coast Guardsmen that were then assigned ashore to assist with the VECTOR phase of training.<ref name="Larzelere229" /><ref name="Scotti185" /> The first transfer of Squadron One cutters occurred at the South Vietnamese Navy Base in Saigon during joint decommissioning and commissioning ceremonies held 16 May 1969 by the Coast Guard and the South Vietnamese Navy. ''Point Garnet'' and ''Point League'' were the first cutters transferred under the ACTOV plan.<ref name="Scotti187" />

====Problems====
SCATTOR training was not easy for either the trainers or the trainees. Cultural differences and language barriers had to be breached by both. English-Vietnamese dictionaries were used extensively and Vietnamese sailors who spoke even broken English were oftentimes pressed into service to help translate the training syllabus for each job on the cutter. Coast Guardsmen that had maintained their cutters with pride couldn't understand the Vietnamese sailors seeming lack of care about housekeeping chores.<ref name=Scotti186>Scotti, p 186</ref> Orders dictated that any cutter entering the ACTOV Program had to be ready for turnover within four months.<ref name="Scotti185" /> Oftentimes after a return from patrol duties the Vietnamese sailors would just leave the cutter as soon as it reached homeport, leaving maintenance, cleanup, and re-provisioning to the Coast Guardsmen.<ref name=Larzelere236>Larzelere, p 236</ref>  [[AWOL]] rates for Vietnamese sailors often interfered with training schedules as well as patrol operations. Morale of the Coast Guardsmen charged with the training of the replacement Vietnamese crew was often very low and this caused friction between the two parts of the crew.<ref name="Larzelere236" /> Because of political pressures in the United States to end involvement in the war as soon as possible, the SCATTOR program of training was accelerated to a fifteen week program and eventually an eleven-week program. This caused overcrowding on the cutters and further problems with the mixed crews.<ref name="Scotti186" /><ref name="Larzelere236" />

All of the Squadron One cutters eventually completed training of the Vietnamese crews and as cutters were transferred to the South Vietnamese Navy each division shrunk in size until they were consolidated with other divisions. Division 11 was disestablished on 5 June 1969 with the remaining cutters in the division moving to Cat Lo. Division 12 was consolidated with Division 13 at Cat Lo 16 March 1970.<ref name="Scotti187" /> [[File:VTN 82 Turnover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|South Vietnamese Navy crewmen board a former Squadron One cutter during re-commissioning ceremonies at Cat Lo Navy Base, 15 August 1970.]]

====Last patrols====
After ''Point Grey'' and ''Point Orient'' were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 14 July only ''Point Cypress'' and ''Point Marone'' were left in Division 13. On that day the remaining two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone.<ref name="Scotti187" /> On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of thirteen SVN sailors and five Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. [[Kit Carson Scouts]] were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats.<ref name="Scotti187" /> The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents.<ref name=Scotti188>Scotti, p 188</ref> A week later both cutters with [[Australian Army]] explosive ordnance detachment soldiers aboard cruised the [[M<U+1EF9> Thanh River]] and destroyed fortifications.<ref name="Scotti188" /><ref name=Kelley5-475>Kelley, sec 5, p 475</ref>

On 4 August 1970, coincidentally [[Coast Guard Day]], the pair of cutters set out on what would prove to be their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts embarked for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, ''Point Marone'' was the target of a command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the SVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with ten Kit Carson Scouts.<ref name="Scotti188" /><ref name=Larzelere227>Larzelere, p 227</ref> After the mine explosion, ''Point Marone'' listed to starboard but managed to get underway while ''Point Cypress'' laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. ''Point Marone'' suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the [[mess deck]] and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud.<ref name="Larzelere229" /> After patching and painting, ''Point Marone'' was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the SVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both ''Point Marone'' and ''Point Cypress''.<ref name="Scotti188" /><ref name=Larzelere238>Larzelere, p 238</ref>

====Last turnover====
With the turnover of ''Point Cypress'' and ''Point Marone'' to the South Vietnamese Navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, came to an end. Over 3000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions that had been carried out by the Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV).<ref name="Scotti187" /><ref name=CNFVMHS0870>{{cite web|title=Monthly Historical Summary. August 1970|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/ar/docs/comnavforv/1970/August1970.pdf|publisher=Naval Historical Center, U.S. Navy|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam|page=74|format=pdf|month=August|year=1970}}</ref><ref name=Larzelere240>Larzelere, p 240</ref> Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One cutters to further assist the new SVN commanding officers in their new duties.<ref name="Larzelere240" /> The Coast Guard continued to provide technical assistance and training under the SCATTOR/VECTOR programs for the South Vietnamese Navy after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four Technical Assistance Groups. Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven [[Marine engineering|engineers]] reporting to SCGOV. The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six cutters. As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.<ref name="CNFVMHS0870" /><ref name="Larzelere240" />

==Civic action==
Coast Guard personnel stationed in Vietnam were encouraged by their commands to donate off duty time to assist in various civic action programs supporting the Vietnamese people. Squadron One personnel participated as time permitted in an island adoption program that was designed to provide educational materials and provide medical treatment to inhabitants of the many coastal islands in their area of operation. This program was offered to counter Viet Cong [[propaganda]] and promote a better understanding of South Vietnamese government and [[USAID]] rural development programs.<ref name=Tulich19>Tulich, p 19</ref> Since medical personnel were normally not a part of the make-up of the Squadron One patrol boat crews, medical corpsmen were borrowed from Squadron Three cutters or nearby Navy units. Division 11 crews constructed a fresh water well and distribution system in addition to constructing voting booths on Hon Thom Island.<ref name=Kelley5-248>Kelley, sec 5, p 248</ref><ref name=Scotti153>Scotti, p 153</ref><ref name=Tulich20>Tulich, p 20</ref> Division 12 cutters helped evacuate refugees from the vicinity of Cape Batangan when military operations became intense during 1967.<ref name="Tulich19" /> Division 13 personnel spent many hours of off duty time at the children's ward of the Army 36th Medevac Hospital and gave games, toys, clothing and candy to injured Vietnamese children.<ref name=Tulich21>Tulich, p 21</ref> All Squadron personnel distributed gifts of candy and toys as well as clothing, soap and toothpaste during the Christmas holidays at local orphanages that had been donated by Coast Guard families in the United States and brought to Vietnam on the Commandant's airplane.<ref name="Tulich20" /> Squadron One crews arranged for transportation of a small girl by an Air Force helicopter to {{USS|Sanctuary|AH-17|6}} for eye surgery while the squadron commander personally delivered a [[cornea]] for transplant.<ref name="Tulich19" /><ref name=Scotti160>Scotti, p 160</ref>

==Legacy and impact==
The cutters of Squadron One made a significant contribution to the success of Operation Market Time by forcing the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces to rely on the difficult [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] for most of their supplies and reinforcements.<ref name=KelleyF-32>Kelley, sec F, p 32</ref><ref name=Johnson336>Johnson, p 336,</ref> During the period between 27 May 1965 and 15 August 1970 the squadron cruised {{convert|4,215,116|mi}} and boarded 236,396 vessels while detaining 10,286 persons. During 4,461 naval gunfire missions they damaged or destroyed 1,811 enemy vessels and killed or wounded 1,232 of the enemy.<ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>

*Vietnam Service Medal
[[File:Vietnam Service Ribbon.svg|right|125px]]
Although the [[Vietnam Service Medal]] is a personal service award, it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and starboard [[bridge wing]]s.<ref name=uscg5>{{cite web|title=Coatings and Color Manual|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/docs/USCG_Painting_Regs_1973.pdf |work=U.S. Coast Guard Coatings and Color Manual CG-263, 16 July 1973|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office|accessdate=18 May 2011}}</ref> Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975.
