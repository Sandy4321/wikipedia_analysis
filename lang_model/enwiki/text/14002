{{nihongo|'''''Katsud<U+014D> Shashin'''''|<U+6D3B><U+52D5><U+5199><U+771F>||''Moving Picture''}}, or the '''Matsumoto fragment''', refers to a Japanese animated film speculated to be the oldest work of [[Anime|animation in Japan]].  Its creator is unknown; evidence suggests it was made sometime between 1907 and 1911, possibly predating the earliest displays of Western animation in Japan.  It was discovered in a home projector in [[Kyoto]] in 2005.

The three-second film depicts a boy who writes "{{lang|ja|<U+6D3B><U+52D5><U+5199><U+771F>}}", removes his hat, and waves.  The frames were [[stencil]]led in red and black using a device for making [[magic lantern]] slides, and the filmstrip was fastened in a loop for continuous play.

==Description==

The film consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a [[celluloid]] strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen [[Frame rate|frames per second]].{{sfn|Anime News Network staff|2005}} It depicts a young boy in a [[sailor suit]] who writes the [[kanji]] characters "{{lang|ja|<U+6D3B><U+52D5><U+5199><U+771F>}}" (''katsud<U+014D> shashin'', or "moving picture"), then turns towards the viewer, removes his hat, and offers a salute.{{sfn|Anime News Network staff|2005}}

Unlike in [[traditional animation]], the frames were not produced by photographing the images, but rather were impressed directly onto film using a [[stencil]].{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}}  This was done with a ''kappa-ban'',{{efn|{{lang|ja|<U+5408><U+7FBD><U+7248>}}; the printing process was called ''kappa-zuri'' ({{lang|ja|<U+5408><U+7FBD><U+5237><U+308A>}}) }} a device designed for stencilling [[magic lantern]] slides.  The images were in red and black on a strip of [[35&nbsp;mm film]]{{efn|The filmstrip has since shrunk to 33.5&nbsp;mm{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=13}} }}{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=116}} whose ends were fastened in a loop for continuous viewing.{{sfn|Asahi Shimbun staff|2005}}

==Background==

[[File:Namakura-gatana (1917) toy movie filmstrip<U+2014>single frame.png|thumb|alt=Film frame of a cartoon samurai holding a sword|Japanese animated films such as [[Junichi Kouchi]]'s ''[[Namakura Gatana|Hanawa Hekonai meit<U+014D> no maki]]'' began appearing in theatres in 1917.]]

Projected film technology first arrived in Japan from the West in 1896<U+2013>97.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=112}}  The earliest foreign animation known to have been shown in Japan is Frenchman [[<U+00C9>mile Cohl]]'s ''The Nipper's Transformations''{{efn|{{lang-fr|Les Exploits de Feu Follet|links=no}}; {{lang-ja|<U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30D1><U+30EB><U+306E><U+5909><U+5F62>|links=no}} }} of 1911, which premiered in Tokyo on 15 April 1912.  Works by [[<U+014C>ten Shimokawa]], [[Seitaro Kitayama]], and [[Junichi Kouchi]] in 1917 were the first Japanese animated films to reach theatre screens.{{sfn|Litten|2013|p=27}} Now [[Lost film|lost]], a few have been discovered in "toy movie"{{efn|{{nihongo||<U+73A9><U+5177>|gangu}} }} versions for viewing at home on hand-cranked projectors; the oldest to survive is ''Hanawa Hekonai meit<U+014D> no maki'' of 1917, known as ''[[Namakura-gatana]]'' in its home version.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|pp=96<U+2013>97}}

Early printed animation films for optical toys such as the [[zoetrope]] predated projected film animation.  German toy manufacturer [[Bing (company)|Gebr<U+00FC>der Bing]] presented a [[cinematograph]] at a toy festival in Nuremberg in 1898; soon other toy manufacturers were selling similar devices.{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=9}}  Live-action films for these devices were expensive to make; possibly as early as 1898 animated films for these devices were on sale, and could be fastened in loops for continuous viewing.{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=10}}  Imports of these German devices appeared in Japan at least as early as 1904,{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=14}} as well as films for them<U+2014>likely including animation loops.{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=15}}

==History==

[[File:Katsud<U+014D> Shashin (1907).webm|thumb|alt=Brief animated film of a boy removing his hat and waving.|''Katsud<U+014D> Shashin'']]

In December 2004, a secondhand dealer in Kyoto contacted Natsuki Matsumoto,{{efn|{{lang|ja|<U+677E><U+672C> <U+590F><U+6A39>}}, b.&nbsp;1952}}{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}} an expert in [[iconography]] at the [[Osaka University of Arts]].{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=169}}  The dealer had obtained a number of films and projectors from an old Kyoto family, and Matsumoto arrived the following January to fetch them.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}}  The collection included three projectors, eleven 35&nbsp;mm films, and thirteen glass magic lantern slides.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}}

On 31 July 2005,{{sfn|Asahi Shimbun staff|2005}} Matsumoto found the filmstrip of ''Katsud<U+014D> Shashin'';{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=169}} it was in poor condition.{{sfn|L<U+00F3>pez|2012|p=584}}  Based on evidence such as the manufacture dates of the projectors in the collection, Matsumoto and animation historian {{ill|ja|Nobuyuki Tsugata|<U+6D25><U+5805><U+4FE1><U+4E4B>}}{{efn|{{lang|ja|<U+6D25><U+5805> <U+4FE1><U+4E4B>}}, b.&nbsp;1968}} determined the film was most likely made between 1907 and 1911.{{sfn|L<U+00F3>pez|2012|p=584}}  At the time, movie theatres were rare in Japan; {{sfn|Asahi Shimbun staff|2005}} evidence suggests it was mass-produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|pp=116<U+2013>117}}  To Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low-tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller film company.{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=15}}  The creator of the film remains unknown.{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=169}}

The discovery was widely covered in Japanese media.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}}  Given its speculated date of creation, the film would have been contemporary to, or even have predated, early animated works by Cohl and Americans [[J.&nbsp;Stuart Blackton]] and [[Winsor McCay]].  While maintaining the importance of the discovery of [[Meiji period]] animation, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' expressed reservations about placing the film in the genealogy of Japanese animation, calling it "controversial that {{interp|''Katsud<U+014D> Shashin''|the newly found film}} should even be called animation in the contemporary sense".{{sfn|L<U+00F3>pez|2012|p=584}}
