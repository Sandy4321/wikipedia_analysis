It was released in {{vgy|2000}}, and is the third and last numbered ''Final Fantasy'' game for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]].

Set in a fantasy world of Gaia, ''Final Fantasy IX''{{'}}s plot centers on a war between several nations, sparked by an ambitious queen. Players follow a young thief named [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Zidane Tribal|Zidane Tribal]], who joins with several others to defeat the Queen. The plot shifts, however, when the characters realize that the Queen is a puppet for an arms dealer named [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Kuja|Kuja]].

''Final Fantasy IX'' was developed alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', but took a different path to return to the series' roots with a more traditional fantasy setting. Consequently, ''Final Fantasy IX'' was influenced heavily by the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', and features allusions to other ''Final Fantasy'' games. ''Final Fantasy IX'' introduced new features to the series, such as the Active Time Event, Mognet, and a revamped equipment and skill system.<ref name="RevGS"/> The game has been subject to generally positive reviews and some consider it the best game in the series.<ref name="RevIGN"/> However, the game received mixed reception for its return to the style of older ''Final Fantasy'' games.<ref name="RevGS"/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Ff9 screenshot fieldicon1.png|thumb|left|The field icon indicates that an object can be inspected, as is the case with this ticket booth.]]
In ''Final Fantasy IX'', the player navigates a character throughout the game world, exploring areas and interacting with [[non-player character]]s. Most of the game occurs in towns, dungeons, caves, and similar areas, which are referred to as "field screens".<ref name="gameguide">{{cite book | year=2000 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy IX instruction manual | pages=29 | publisher=Square Co. | language=English | id=SLUS-01251}}</ref> To aid exploration on the field screen, ''Final Fantasy IX'' introduces the "field icon", an exclamation mark appearing over their lead character's head, signaling that an item or sign is nearby.<ref name="gameguide" /><ref>{{cite web | author = Square Nation | url = http://www.squarenation.com/ffix/ | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061212043620/http://www.squarenation.com/ffix/ | archivedate=2006-12-12 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061212043620/http://www.squarenation.com/ffix/ | archivedate=2006-12-12 | title = INFORMATION & REVIEWS | publisher = Square Nation | accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref> Players speak with [[moogle]]s to record their progress, restore life energy with a tent, and purchase items<ref>{{cite web | author = Cuellar, Jose | date= 2001-02-07 | url = http://www.nd.edu/~observer/02072001/Scene/2.html | title = Magic of `Final Fantasy IX' creates best in series | publisher = ''The Observer'' (Notre Dame) | accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref> &mdash; a deviation from previous installments, which used a save point to perform these functions. Moogles may request that the playable character deliver letters to other Moogles via "Mognet".<ref name="gameguide"/>

Players journey between field screen locations via the [[overworld|world map]], a three dimensional, downsized representation of ''Final Fantasy IX''{{'}}s world presented from a [[top-down perspective]].<ref name="gameguide"/> Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain, such as water or mountains. To overcome geographical limitations, players can ride [[emu]]-like [[chocobo]]s, sail on a boat, or pilot [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airships]]. Like previous ''Final Fantasy'' installments, travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by [[Random encounter|random enemy encounter]]s.<ref name="RevIGN" /><ref name="gameguide" />

''Final Fantasy IX'' offers a new approach to town exploration with Active Time Events (ATE), which provide character development, special items, and prompts for key story-altering decisions.<ref name="gameguide" /> At specific points, the player may view events that are occurring simultaneously. ATE is occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party is divided to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.

===Combat===
Whenever the playable character encounters an enemy, the map changes to the "battle screen". On the battle screen, the enemy appears on the opposite side of the characters; each battle uses the familiar [[Square Enix battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system that was first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''.<ref name="RevIGN"/> The character's command list is presented in a [[window (computing)|window]] opposite the ATB gauge list; while all characters can physically attack the enemy or use an item from the player's inventory, they also possess unique abilities. For instance, the thief Zidane can steal items from the enemy, Eiko and Garnet can summon "[[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|eidolons]]" to aid the party, and Vivi can use [[Final Fantasy magic#Black magic|black magic]] to damage the opposition.<ref name="gameguide"/>

[[Image:Ff9 screenshot bossbattle.png|thumb|left|In this early [[boss (video game)|boss]] battle, Steiner attacks the enemy while Zidane awaits the player's input.]]

These character-specific commands change when the player goes into "[[common elements of Final Fantasy#Battle systems and Limit Breaks|Trance]] mode", which is activated for a short duration when an uncontrollable gauge fills as character sustains damage in a style similar to the Limit Breaks used in ''Final Fantasy VII''. When the gauge is full, the character's strength is amplified, and the player can select special attack commands.<ref name="RevGS"/> Zidane's "Skill" command list, for example, changes to "Dyne", allowing him to execute powerful attacks; Vivi's "Black Magic" command evolves into "Double Black", allowing him to cast two magic spells simultaneously.<ref name="gameguide"/> Through the Configuration screen, the player can change the Battle Style from Normal to Custom, which allows two players to control two characters during battle. However, two controllers must be plugged into the PlayStation.<ref name="RevGS"/>

A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical values ("statistics") for categories such as speed, strength, and magical power. Character statistics are driven by experience; when players win battles, they are awarded "[[experience point]]s", which accumulate until characters gain "experience levels". When characters "level up", the statistics for their attributes permanently increase, which may also be amplified by the types of equipment the character is wearing. Winning battles also awards the player money ([[Final Fantasy items#Currency|Gil]]), [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Tetra Master|Tetra Master]] playing cards, and ability points (AP).<ref name="gameguide"/>

===Equipment and abilities===
''Final Fantasy IX'' deviates from the style of customizable characters featured in the last two titles by reviving the character class concept, which designates a character to a certain role in battle.<ref>{{cite book | year=1997 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VII North American instruction manual | pages=20<U+2013>25 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SCUS-94163}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=20, 24, 36 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SLUS-00892GH}}</ref> For instance, Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use black magic, and Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills.<ref name="RevGS"/><ref name="gameguide"/>

The basic function of equipment in ''Final Fantasy'' games is to increase character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In ''Final Fantasy IX'', weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use once the item is equipped (permitting that the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped.<ref name="gameguide"/>

Abilities are classified into action and support categories. Action abilities consume [[magic point]]s (MP) and include magic spells and special moves that are used in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely (e.g., the support ability "Antibody" nullifies poisonous attacks), and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.<ref name="gameguide"/><ref name="RevGS"/>

===Setting===
[[Image:Ff9 screenshot gaiamap.png|thumb|A geographical map of Gaia]]
''Final Fantasy IX'' takes place primarily on the four continents of a world named Gaia (homonymous with [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)|''Final Fantasy VII'''s Gaia]], but not the same world). Most of Gaia's population resides on the [[List of Final Fantasy IX locations#Mist Continent|Mist Continent]], named so because the entire continent is blanketed in thick mist. Lands outside the Mist Continent &mdash; the Outer, Lost and Forgotten continents &mdash; are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game. Several locations on the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas. The Mist Continent features four factions: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Each country is separated by mountain ranges; the Cleyran civilization, nestled in a giant tree in the desert, is protected by a constant sandstorm.

Gaia is inhabited by humans and various non-human races. Alexandria and Lindblum are both populated by a mix of humans and anthropomorphic animals. The Burmecians are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[rat]]s who live in both Burmecia and Cleyra. The Cleyrans, who value dance, split from the Burmecians when the latter started to appreciate "the art of war". The dwarves are short humanoid creatures who appear as inhabitants of the village of Conde Petie on the Outer Continent. Genomes are soulless vessels who exist in Terra to wait for the restoration of Terra when it takes over Gaia; when this occurs, the Terran souls will enter the Genome bodies. [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|Summoners]] are similar to other humans, but with a horn on their forehead. In the story, only two summoners remain (Garnet and Eiko); the others were exterminated during the Terran warship Invincible's destruction of their homeland of Madain Sari. Lastly, the Qu are large, seemingly [[Androgyny|androgynous]] humanoids,<ref name="mainsite">{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/FFIX-gamesite/|title=Final Fantasy IX|publisher=North American Square Enix|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> who are recognized as fine gourmands. They inhabit marshlands throughout the world where they catch their main source of nutrition: frogs.

In ''Final Fantasy IX'', the game's developers sought to make the game's environment more "fantasy-oriented" than its PlayStation predecessors. Since the creators wanted to prevent the series from following a redundant setting, ''Final Fantasy IX'' distinctly breaks from the futuristic styles of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' by reintroducing a medieval setting.<ref name="RevIGN" /> In the game, the advent of steam technology is just beginning to rise; the population relies on [[hydropower]] or [[wind power]] for energy sources, but sometimes harness Mist or steam to power more advanced engines.<ref>'''Man:''' I'll be joining a team of engineers who are developing a new engine that runs without Mist. The world outside the Mist Continent is uncharted territory, but there's no need to worry about our safety if we can explore it on an airship. Regent Cid is an advocate of technological advancement. Oh, sorry. I talked your ear off." {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square  |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Continuing with the medieval theme, the game's setting is inspired by [[Norse mythology|Norse]] and [[Northern Europe]]an mythology. According to director [[Hiroyuki It<U+014D>]], "[The development team is] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama".<ref name="IGNInterview1">{{cite web|date=September 20, 2000|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/085/085276p1.html|title=The Final Fantasy IX Team Spills All|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> The main ''Final Fantasy IX'' website says the development of the game's world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the "successful elements of the past, such as a return to the fantasy roots," with newer elements.<ref name="mainsite"/>

The eight main playable characters in ''Final Fantasy IX'' are [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Zidane|Zidane Tribal]], a member of a group of bandits called Tantalus and a womanizer; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Garnet|Garnet Til Alexandros XVII]] (''alias'' Dagger) the Princess of Alexandria who has a strange connection to "Eidolons"; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Vivi|Vivi Orunitia]], a young, timid, and kind Black Mage; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Steiner|Adelbert Steiner]], the Captain of the Knights of Pluto and loyal servant of Alexandria and Princess Garnet; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Freya|Freya Crescent]], a Dragon Knight from the city of Burmecia; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Quina|Quina Quen]], a genderless Qu whose master wants him/her to travel the world so that s/he will learn about [[cuisine]]; [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Eiko|Eiko Carol]], a six-year-old girl living in Madain Sari, the lost village of the Eidolon summoners; and [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Amarant|Amarant Coral]], a bounty hunter framed for a crime committed by Zidane that he tried to prevent.<ref name="mainsite"/> Other main characters include Regent Cid Fabool, the charismatic leader of the Lindblum kingdom; Queen Brahne, Garnet's mother and the power-hungry Queen of Alexandria; General Beatrix, the powerful leader of the female knights of Alexandria; and antagonist [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Kuja|Kuja]], an enemy of Gaia. Other minor characters and groups also appear; their significance and back-stories are revealed as the game progresses.

During development, the creators made the characters a high priority.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> The return to the series' roots also affected the characters' designs, which resulted in characters with "comic-like looks".<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> Uematsu commented that they still attempted to give the characters realism while still appearing comic-like.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> To accomplish this and to satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of ''Final Fantasy VIII'', the designers stressed creating characters that the player could still easily relate with.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/>

===Story===
[[Image:FFIX Alexandria primavista.jpg|thumb|Tantalus' airship, the ''Prima Vista'', approaches Alexandria.]]
''Final Fantasy IX'' begins with Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe kidnapping Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration. The group learns that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, actually wanted to escape to Lindblum to meet with Regent Cid,<ref>'''Garnet''': I am actually... Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, heir to the throne of Alexandria. I have a favor I wish to ask of you... I wish to be kidnapped...right away. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> and had planned to stow away on the theater ship. The Troupe's airship, ''Prima Vista'', is attacked by the royal guards, and damaged during the escape; it crashes in the Evil Forest, prompting Zidane to continue the trek to Lindblum without the rest of Tantalus.<ref>'''Baku''': So, you're leaving, eh? / '''Zidane''': Yeah... I promised Garnet I'd kidnap her. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Zidane and Garnet are accompanied by Vivi and Steiner, who became entangled with Tantalus during their escape from Alexandria. During their journey, Garnet adopts the alias "Dagger" and struggles to mingle with the locals.<ref>'''Garnet''': I will be called Dagger from now on. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square  |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> The group learns of a factory that is manufacturing soulless Black Mage warriors for Alexandria's use. Three powerful ones called Black Waltzes are sent by Brahne to retrieve Garnet by force, but in vain.

In Lindblum, Zidane meets Freya and joins in Lindblum's Festival of the Hunt. Regent Cid has been turned into a bug-like oglop by his wife Hilda, for his womanizing behavior.<ref>'''Regent Cid''': "When Hilda found out about my little affair, she used her magic and turned me into an oglop. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Wishing to protect Garnet from Brahne's newfound aggression, he had ordered Tantalus to kidnap her.<ref>'''Dagger''': Uncle Cid hired Tantalus out of concern for my safety. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> When the group learns that Alexandria has invaded Burmecia, Freya investigates the situation with Zidane and Vivi, while Dagger and Steiner head to Alexandria to ask Brahne to stop the war.<ref>'''Dagger''': I have to help Mother... I don't want to see anything happen to her... / '''Steiner''': Very well. Princess, I will follow you wherever you choose. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Both parties are powerless to stop her, and Dagger has her [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|eidolons]] forcibly extracted from her body.<ref>'''Queen Brahne''': Zorn, Thorn! Prepare to extract the eidolons from Garnet. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Brahne uses Dagger's eidolons to destroy Cleyra, after which she attacks Lindblum, forcing Cid to surrender.<ref>'''Minister Artania''': Yes, Princess. The castle was spared. Regent Cid is alive. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Zidane, Freya, and Vivi, after witnessing the assault on Cleyra, rescue Dagger, befriend General Beatrix, and return to Lindblum.

[[Image:FFIX iifatree.jpg|left|thumb|Bahamut approaches the Iifa Tree]]

Afterward, Cid tells the party about Brahne's arms dealer, Kuja.<ref>'''Regent Cid''': I believe Kuja is the only one supplying <gwok> Brahne with weapons. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> The party travels to the Outer Continent, the location of Kuja's headquarters, through an underground tunnel with the help of Quina.<ref>'''Minister Artania''': That he came from the north suggests he's from the Outer Continent. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> There, the party meets a young summoner named Eiko, who assumes herself to be the last survivor of Madain Sari. They also discover a village inhabited by self-aware Black Mages. Their pursuit of Kuja leads them to the nearby Iifa Tree, an entity that dissipates fighting-stimulant Mist.<ref>'''Soulcage''': I contaminate the other continents with Mist to stimulate the fighting instinct. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> They also learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages.<ref>'''Zidane''': What kind of weapons did Kuja make? / '''Soulcage''': Kuja called them black mages, dark spawn of the Mist. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> The party defeats the Iifa Tree's core and stops the Mist from flowing. When the party returns to Madain Sari, they confront Amarant, who was hired by Brahne to apprehend Dagger. Dagger slowly realizes that she is also a Summoner from Madain Sari. Amarant joins the party for his own reasons. At the Iifa Tree, Brahne turns against Kuja and intends to kill him with the eidolon Bahamut.<ref>'''Queen Brahne''': Kuja! So you finally decided to show your girly face here! You're all that stands between me and total domination! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> However, Kuja uses the airship Invincible to gain control of Bahamut, killing Brahne and defeating her army.<ref>'''Kuja''': Excellent, Bahamut! Power, mobility... You truly are the best! You even hurt me...a little. And you, Brahne... Your tragic role in this drama now comes to an end! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref>

The party returns to Alexandria, and Garnet is crowned Queen. Afterward, Kuja assaults Alexandria with Bahamut. Eiko and Garnet summon the legendary eidolon Alexander, who happens to dwell within the royal castle of Alexandria. Alexander spreads his wings out of the very foundation of the castle and protects the castle from Bahamuts powerful Mega Flare attacks. Eventually Alexander overpowers Bahamut. Kuja attempts to control Alexander using the Invincible, but is foiled by a mysterious old man named Garland, who destroys Alexander and parts of Alexandria.<ref>'''Garland''': You have gone too far, Kuja. I granted you the freedom to do as you wish in Gaia for one purpose alone. Now that you have lost sight of your mission, I will no longer tolerate your actions. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Kuja, still intent on mastering a powerful eidolon to defeat Garland, shifts his attention to Eiko.<ref>'''Kuja''': I sense power from within her. Continue the extraction!" {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref>  The party learns of Kuja's Desert Palace and attempts an assault. However, Kuja imprisons the party and escapes with Eiko to extract her eidolons. During the extraction attempt, Eiko's guardian moogle Mog uses Trance to transform into her true form, the eidolon Madeen, and defeats the process.<ref>'''Eiko''': Mog saved me... I never knew that Mog was an eidolon. She always looked after me...disguised as a moogle. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Learning of the powers of Trance,<ref>'''Kuja''': How can that--That moogle went into a Trance!? So...an eruption of anger against one's surroundings induces a complete Trance! It's not the will to live, nor is it the desire to protect another! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> Kuja escapes to further his aim of defeating Garland.<ref>'''Kuja''': I need an eidolon more powerful than Alexander! An eidolon with the power to bury Garland! His powers are so incredible; I cannot even come close. I must destroy him before Terra's plan is activated, or my soul will no longer be my own! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> The party rescues Eiko and also finds Hilda, who turns Cid back into a human. He is now able to design an airship for the party that does not need Mist for power.<ref>'''Hilda''': Alright. I'll turn you back. But it's going to be much worse if you ever cheat on me again! / '''Regent Cid''': I...I understand. Now turn me back! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref>

With Hilda's aid,<ref>'''Hilda''': You may find a clue if you go to Ipsen's Castle. / '''Eiko''': Did you ask Kuja about all of this? / '''Hilda''': These are things he discussed voluntarily. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> the party pursues Kuja to Terra by opening a portal. In the Terran town of Bran Bal, it is revealed that Garland was created by the people of Terra to orchestrate the process of assimilating Terra into Gaia, as Terra was a dying world. Garland created Genomes &mdash; intelligent, sentient beings who lack souls &mdash; to become future vessels for the souls of the Terrans.<ref>'''Garland''': I constructed the Genomes to be vessels for the souls of the people of Terra when they awaken. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> The Iifa Tree's existence,<ref>'''Garland''': the Iifa Tree blocks the flow of Gaia's souls, while it lets those of Terra flow freely. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy IX |developer=Square |publisher=Square |date=2000-11-14 |platform=PlayStation | language=English}}</ref> the phenomenon of Mist,<ref>'''Garland''': The role of the Iifa Tree is that of Soul Divider.

The party discovers that Mist has returned and now envelops all of Gaia. Assisted by the combined forces of Burmecia, Lindblum, and Alexandria, they travel to the Iifa Tree, where they are teleported to a mysterious location called Memoria.

Some time later, Alexandria has been rebuilt, and Tantalus arrives in Alexandria to perform a play for Queen Garnet. During the performance, one of the  performers removes his robe and reveals himself to be Zidane. The credits roll as Garnet and Zidane embrace. Other scenes reveal that Vivi somehow has children; Steiner and Beatrix have returned to their old posts as royal bodyguards; Eiko has been adopted by Regent Cid and Hilda; Freya is attempting to start over with her former love, Sir Fratley; and Quina has frequented the Alexandria Castle kitchen.

==Development and release==
[[Image:Ff9 strategyguide scan.png|thumb|The guide's list of armor urges readers to log onto PlayOnline for a complete listing.]]
Development of ''Final Fantasy IX'' began before Square had finished development on its predecessor, ''Final Fantasy VIII''.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> The game was developed in [[Hawaii]] as a compromise to developers living in the United States.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> As the series' last game on the PlayStation, Sakaguchi envisioned a "reflection" on the older titles of the series.  ''Final Fantasy IX'' is also considered by Sakaguchi to be his favorite game as "it's closest to [his] ideal view of what Final Fantasy should be".<ref name="IGNInterview2">{{cite web| author=IGN Staff | date=2000-04-05 |url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/077/077571p1.html| title=Interview with Hironobu Sakaguchi| publisher=[[IGN]]| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> This shift was also a response to demands from fans and other developers.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/> Additionally, the team wanted to create an understandable story with deep character development; this led to the creation of Active Time Events.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/>

[[Image:Ff9 screenshot fmvcharacters.png|thumb|left|Vivi, Zidane, Garnet, and Steiner in a [[full motion video]] sequence; their features are less realistic, compared to previous titles in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.]]

In the game's conceptual stage, the developers made it clear that the title would not necessarily be ''Final Fantasy IX'', as its break from the realism of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy VIII'' may have alienated audiences. This led the Gaming Intelligence Agency to speculate that it would be released as a "gaiden" to the main series.<ref name="GIA">{{cite web| author=NGO Staff | date=1999-05-24|url=http://rca.vnm.zhdk.ch/mirrors/thegia/sites/www.thegia.com/news/n990524a.html|title=New Final Fantasy revealed|publisher=Gaming Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> By late 1999, however, Square had confirmed that the game would indeed be published as ''Final Fantasy IX'', and by early 2000, the game was nearly finished. The developers made several adjustments to the game, such as changing the ending seven times.<ref name="IGNInterview1"/>

''Final Fantasy IX'''s release was delayed to avoid a concurrent release with rival [[Enix]]'s ''[[Dragon Quest VII]]''. On [[October 7]], [[2000]], a demo day for the North American version of ''Final Fantasy IX'' was held at the Metreon in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="DemoDay">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-10-02|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/085/085810p1.html|title=Square EA Holds FFIX Demo Day|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon; limited edition merchandise was included with the game, and fans [[cosplay]]ed as ''Final Fantasy'' characters in celebration of the release.<ref name="FirstAmerican">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-11-13|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/087/087740p1.html|title=Final Fantasy IX Goes on Sale Early|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> In [[Canada]], a production error left copies of ''Final Fantasy IX'' without an English version of the instruction manual, prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later.<ref name="CanadianManual">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-11-20|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/088/088111p1.html|title=Canadian Customers Get FFIX in French|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

The game was heavily promoted both before and after its release. Starting on [[March 6]], [[2000]], ''Final Fantasy IX'' characters were used in a line of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Coca-Cola]] commercials. Figurines of several characters were also used as prizes in Coca-Cola's marketing campaign.<ref name="Coke">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-03-31|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/077/077377p1.html|title=TGS: Final Fantasy IX Characters Do Coke|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> That same year, [[IGN]] awarded ''Final Fantasy'' dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests.<ref name="ViviDoll">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|date=2000-11-27|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/088/088315p1.html|title=Win Vivi from FFIX!|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy IX'' was also the benchmark of Square's interactive [[PlayOnline]] service. PlayOnline was originally developed to interact with ''Final Fantasy X'', but when those plans fell through it became a strategy site for ''Final Fantasy IX''. The site was designed to complement BradyGames' and Piggyback Interactive's official strategy guides for the game, where players who bought the print guide had access to "keywords" that could be searched for on PlayOnline's site for extra tips and information. This caused fury among buyers of the guide, as they felt cheated for the expensive print guide. The blunder made GameSpy readers' "Top 5 Dumbest Moments in Gaming" list,<ref>{{cite web | date= 2003-06-14 | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ | title = The 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming - Readers' Top 5 | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}</ref> and Square dropped the idea for ''Final Fantasy X'', which was under development at the time.

==Audio==
[[Image:Ffixostfrontcover.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack'']]
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy IX}}
The music of ''Final Fantasy IX'' was created by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], his last exclusive ''Final Fantasy'' score. In discussions with It<U+014D>, Uematsu was told "It'd be fine if you compose tracks for the eight characters, an exciting battle track, a gloomy, danger-evoking piece, and around ten tracks or so." However, Uematsu spent an estimated year composing and producing "around 160" pieces for ''Final Fantasy IX'', with 140 appearing in the game.<ref name="fami-interview">{{cite web |title=Nobuo Uematsu Interview by Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/nobrpg.html | publisher=[[Famitsu]] | accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref name="ign-interview">{{cite web | title=The Final Fantasy IX Team Spills All | date=2000-09-21 | author=Zdyrko, Dave  | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20001203212500/http://psx.ign.com/news/25276.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

Nobuo Uematsu composed with a piano and used two contrasting methods: "I create music that fits the events in the game, but sometimes, the event designer will adjust a game event to fit the music I've already written." Uematsu felt ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' had a mood of realism, but ''Final Fantasy IX'' was fantasy, so "a serious piece as well as silly, fun pieces could fit in." He felt the theme was [[medieval music]], and was given a break to travel in [[Europe]] for inspiration - "looking at old castles in [[Germany]] and so on." The music was not entirely composed in the medieval mode, Uematsu claims that "it would be unbalanced" and "a little boring". He aimed for a "simple, warm" style and included uncommon instruments such as a [[kazoo]] and [[dulcimer]]. Uematsu also included motifs from older ''Final Fantasy'' games "because ''Final Fantasy IX'' was returning to the roots, so to speak" and incorporated ideas such as "the old intro for battle music" and arranged the Volcano theme from ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' and the Pandemonium theme from ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''.<ref name="fami-interview" /><ref name="ign-interview" />

Uematsu was twice reported claiming without hesitation that ''Final Fantasy IX'' has his favorite score.<ref>{{cite web | title=<U+201C>SMILE, PLEASE!<U+201D>: NEO INTERVIEWS FINAL FANTASY COMPOSER, NOBUO UEMATSU  | url=http://www.neomag.co.uk/article.asp?IntID=14 | publisher=''[[Neo (magazine)|NEO]]'' (NEO 002) | author=Taylor, Stu | accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Focus On: Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7033 | date=2005-02-02 | author=Fahey, Rob | publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] | accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> The original [[soundtrack]] for the game has 110 tracks; an additional soundtrack, ''Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS'', was released with 42 more new tracks. Like ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''Final Fantasy X'', ''Final Fantasy IX'' features a [[J-pop]] [[ballad]], ''Melodies of Life''. The song was composed by Uematsu, written by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] (as Shiomi) in Japanese and [[Alexander O. Smith]] in English, and performed by [[Emiko Shiratori]]. The song itself was sung in Japanese for the Japanese release of the game, and in English for the North American and European releases.

Reviewers pointed out that the strength of the game lies on the gameplay, character development, and visual representation. GameSpot noted that the learning curve is easily grasped, and the ability system is not as complex as in ''Final Fantasy VII'' or ''Final Fantasy VIII''.<ref name="RevGS">{{cite web | author=Vestal, Andrew | date=2000-07-19 | title=Final Fantasy IX Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy9/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> Each player character possesses unique abilities, which hinders the development of an over-powered character. GameSpot describes the battle system as having a tactical nature and the expanded party allowing for more interaction between players and between enemies.<ref name="RevGS"/> Nevertheless, [[IGN]] disliked the lengthy combat pace and the repeated battles, describing it as aggravating, and RPGFan feels the Trance system to be ineffective as the meter buildup is slow and unpredictable, with characters Trancing just before the enemy is killed.<ref name="RevIGN">{{cite web | author=Smith, David| date=2000 | title=Final Fantasy IX Review | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162190p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref><ref name="RevRPGF">{{cite web | author=Sensei Phoenix | date=2000 | title=''Final Fantasy IX Review'' | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/finalfantasy9/Final_Fantasy_9-2.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

The characters and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN feels the in-depth character traits in ''Final Fantasy IX'' could be generally found in other ''Final Fantasy'' games, they are nevertheless engaging and sympathetic.<ref name="RevIGN"/> GameSpot finds the characters, up to their dialog and traits, amusing and full of humor.<ref name="RevGS"/> IGN also noted that the Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions.<ref name="RevIGN"/> Their super-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. Praise is given to the pre-rendered backgrounds as careful attention is given to the artwork, movement and animations as well as character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.<ref name="RevRPGF"/>

On the other hand, critics acknowledged that the overall story is recycled from previous ''Final Fantasy'' installments and other role-playing games. However, the repeated elements such as evil kingdoms and enigmatic villains are believed by RPGFan as an attempt to emulate the elements of previous ''Final Fantasy'' plot and storyline.<ref name="RevRPGF"/> The main villain, though considered by GameSpot to be the least threatening in the series,<ref name="RevGS"/> is seen by IGN as a mixture of past villains through behavior and appearance.<ref name="RevIGN"/> Mixed reactions were given to the audio aspects of the game. Some reviewers, such as RPGFan feels the sound effect and music "uninspired, dull and annoying"; IGN and GameSpot acknowledges that only a handful of the tracks are memorable, while ''GamePro'' praised the audio for evoking "emotions throughout the story, from battles... to comedy".<ref name="RevGS"/><ref name="RevIGN"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/psx/games/reviews/7357.shtml | author=Uncledust| title=Review: Final Fantasy IX | date=2000-11-15 | publisher= [[GamePro]] | accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref> Criticism is made on the composer who seemed to have only reused and simplified the scores of past series. Nevertheless, reviewers have come to agree that this and many other elements are part of the overall effort to create a nostalgic title for fans of the older ''Final Fantasy'' series.<ref name="RevGS"/><ref name="RevIGN"/><ref name="RevRPGF"/>

The strategy guide also gained criticism; the book's given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website, but Square-Enix backed up all the files for the guide and placed them in a new site.<ref>{{cite web | date= 2007-04-03 | url = http://na.square-enix.com/strategy/FF9/ | title = Final Fantasy IX PlayOnline.com Strategy Guide | publisher = [[Square Enix]] | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Tetra Master|Tetra Master]] was seen by GameSpot as inferior and confusing compared to ''Final Fantasy VIII''{{'}}s mini-game [[Minigames of Final Fantasy#Triple Triad|Triple Triad]], as the rules for it were only vaguely explained in the game and there were very few rewards earned from playing it despite its extensiveness.<ref name="RevGS"/>
