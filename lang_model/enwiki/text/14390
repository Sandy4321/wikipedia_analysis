'''Zion National Park''' is a [[United States National Park]] located in the [[Southwestern United States]],  near [[Springdale, Utah]]. A prominent feature of the 229-[[square mile|square-mile]] ([[1 E8 m<U+00B2>|593 km<U+00B2>]]) park is '''Zion Canyon''', 15 miles (24 km) long and up to half a mile (800&nbsp;m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored [[Navajo Sandstone]] by the North Fork of the [[Virgin River]]. 
Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, [[Great Basin]], and [[Mojave Desert]] regions, this unique [[geography]] and variety of [[life zone]]s allow for unusual [[plant]] and [[animal]] diversity. A total of 289 [[bird]] species, 75 [[mammal]]s (including 19 species of [[bat]]), 32 [[reptile]]s and numerous plant species inhabit the park's four life zones: [[desert]], [[riparian]], [[woodland]], and [[coniferous forest]]. Notable megafauna include [[Cougar|Mountain Lions]], [[Mule Deer]] and [[Golden Eagle]]s, along with reintroduced [[California Condor]]s and [[Bighorn Sheep]]. Common plant species include [[Cottonwood]], [[Cactus]], [[Datura]], [[Juniper]], [[Pine]], [[Boxelder]], [[Sagebrush]] and various [[willow]]s.

Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s; the semi-nomadic Basketmaker [[Anasazi]] (300 CE) stem from one of these groups. In turn, the [[Virgin Anasazi]] culture (500 CE) developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. A different group, the [[Fremont people|Parowan Fremont]], lived in the area as well. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern [[Paiute]] subtribes. The canyon was discovered by [[Mormon]]s in 1858 and was settled by that same group in the early 1860s. '''Mukuntuweap National Monument''' was established in 1909 to protect the canyon, and by 1919 the monument was expanded to become Zion National Park (''[[Zion]]'' is an ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning a place of refuge or sanctuary). The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate '''Zion National Monument''' in 1937, but was incorporated into the park in 1956. 

The [[geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area]] includes nine [[formation (geology)|formation]]s that together represent 150 million years of mostly [[Mesozoic]]-aged [[sedimentation]]. At various periods in that time, warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the [[Colorado Plateau]]s lifted the region 10,000 feet (3000 m) starting 13 million years ago.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:zion_mount_carmel_highway_view.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Spectacular Zion scenery as seen from the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway]]
The park is located in southwestern [[Utah]] in [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]], [[Iron County, Utah|Iron]], and [[Kane County, Utah|Kane]] counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the [[Markagunt Plateau|Markagunt]] and [[Kolob Plateau|Kolob]] plateaus, at the intersection of three [[North America]]n geographic provinces: The [[Colorado Plateau]]s, the [[Great Basin]], and the [[Mojave Desert]]. The northern part of the park is known as the Kolob Canyons section and is accessible from [[Interstate 15]], exit 40.

The 8,726&nbsp;foot (2660&nbsp;m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain ([[:image:Horse Ranch Mountain-1.jpeg|photo]]) is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666&nbsp;foot (1117&nbsp;m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100&nbsp;feet (1500&nbsp;m).

Streams in the area follow rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks. The headwaters of the Virgin River are at about 9,000&nbsp;feet (2700&nbsp;m) and the river empties into [[Lake Mead]] 200 [[mile]]s (320&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) southeast after flowing 8,000&nbsp;feet (2400&nbsp;m) downward. This gives the Virgin a [[stream gradient]] that ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (0.9&ndash;1.5%)&mdash;one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.

[[Image:Zion-Temple-of-Sinawava-waterfall-NPS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Temple of Sinawava Waterfall]]
The road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava ("Sinawava" refers to the Coyote God of the Paiute Indians<ref>Charles P. Alexander, "Records and Descriptions of North American Crane-Flies (Diptera). Part VII. The Tipuloidea of Utah," ''American Midland Naturalist'', Vol. 39, No. 1. (Jan., 1948), pp. 1-82</ref><ref>[http://www.nebagamon312.com/Lodgehis.htm A Short History of Nebagamon Lodge 312], Retrieved 4 January 2007</ref>). At the Temple, the canyon narrows and a foot-trail continues to the mouth of the [[Zion Narrows]], a spectacular gorge with walls 40<U+2013>100 feet (12<U+2013>30 meters) wide and 1000 feet (300 m) tall. The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year.  Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.

Other areas of the park also offer outstanding scenery. The east side of the park is served by the [[State Route 9 (Utah)|Zion-Mount Carmel Highway]] which passes through the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at Mt. Carmel Junction. On the east side of the park notable park features include [[:Image:Checkerboard Mesa in Zion National Park.jpeg|Checkerboard Mesa]] and the East Temple and one of the more popular hikes, the Canyon Overlook Trail. 

West of Zion Canyon, the Kolob Terrace area features The Subway, a famous slot canyon hike, and Lava Point, with a spectacular view of the entire area. The Kolob Canyons section, further west near [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], features one of the world's longest arches, [[Kolob Arch]]. 

[[Image:Zion National Park map1.jpg|thumb|275px|Map of Zion National Park showing the Zion and Kolob canyon sections.]]

Spring [[weather]] is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in March. Spring [[wildflower]]s bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]] to 110&nbsp;<U+00B0>F; 35&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] to 43&nbsp;<U+00B0>C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65&nbsp;<U+00B0>F to 70&nbsp;<U+00B0>F; 18&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s are common from mid-July through mid-September. Storms may produce [[waterfall]]s as well as [[flash flood]]s. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; inside Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring [[rain]] or light [[snow]] to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (16&nbsp;<U+00B0>C); nights are often 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>F to 40&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (<U+2212>7&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road and the Kolob Canyons Road, which are closed when covered with snow. Winter driving conditions persist from November through March.

==Human history==
Archaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods, each characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.

===Archaic period===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Scouts reconstructing an Anasazi granary near Weeping Rock.jpeg|thumb|Scouts reconstructing an Anasazi granary near Weeping Rock. The Basketmaker Anasazi entered the area circa 300 CE.{{deletable image-caption}}]] -->
The first human use in the region dates to [[6th millennium BCE|8,000 years ago]] when family groups camped where they could [[hunting|hunt]] or collect plants and [[seed]]s. About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing [[maize]] and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages (called [[pueblo]]s). Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500 CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and [[yucca]] fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were hafted to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called [[atlatl]]s. 

By 300 CE some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic [[Anasazi]], the Basketmakers. Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited [[agriculture]]. Locally collected [[pine nut]]s were important for food and trade.

===Protohistoric period===
The Parrusits and several other Southern [[Paiute]] subtribes lived in the Virgin River Valley south of Zion Canyon for hundreds of years following the departure of the Anasazi and Fremont Indians around 1300 CE. Tradition and archaeological evidence holds that they are a Numic-speaking cousin of the Virgin Anasazi. Parrusits seasonally migrated up and down the valley in search of wild seeds and [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s in what is called the Neo-Archaic period. Some farming and hunting supplemented their diet.

Evidence suggests the Parrusits had great reverence for the large [[monolith]]s and turbulent waters in Zion Canyon. They believed the monoliths were responsible for the streams and springs they depended upon by communicating with the [[rock (geology)|rock]]s, animals, [[water]], and plants that make their home there. Modern bands of Southern Paiute still visit sites within the park to perform rituals and collect plants.
[[image:Southern Paiute kaun huts.jpeg|thumb|Kaun huts were used by bands of Southern Paiute who lived in the area.]]

===Historic period===
====Early exploration====
The Historic period begins in the late 18th century, with the exploration and settlement of southern Utah by [[Euro-American]]s. Padres [[Silvestre V<U+00E9>lez de Escalante]] and [[Francisco Atanasio Dom<U+00ED>nguez]] passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on [[October 13]] [[1776]], becoming the first white men known to visit the area. In 1826, trapper and trader [[Jedediah Smith]] led 16 men to explore the area in a quest to find a route to [[California]]. These and other explorations by traders from [[New Mexico]] blazed the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]], which followed the Virgin River for a portion of its length. Captain [[John C. Fremont]] wrote about his 1844 journeys in the region.

====Mormon pioneers and the Powell expedition====
In the 1850s, [[Mormon]] farmers from the [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake]] area became the first white people to settle the [[Virgin River]] region. In 1851, the Parowan and [[Cedar City, Utah]] areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[horse]]s. They prospected for [[mineral]] deposits, and diverted Kolob water to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area ''[[Kolob]]'' - in Mormon scripture, the [[star]] nearest the residence of [[God]].

In 1858, they had expanded 30 miles south to the lower Virgin River. That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter [[Nephi Johnson]] into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon. Johnson wrote a favorable report about the [[agriculture|agricultural]] potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. More settlers arrived in 1860 and 1861 and settled the towns of Rockville and Springdale. Catastrophic flooding by the river (especially in the Great Flood of 1861<U+2013>1862), little [[arable land]], and poor [[soil]]s made agriculture in the upper Virgin River a risky venture. 

In 1861 or 1862, [[Joseph Black (Mormon pioneer)|Joseph Black]] made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty. His stories about the Canyon were at first seen as exaggerated, prompting his neighbors to call the Canyon "Joseph's Glory". The floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by [[Isaac Behunin]], who farmed corn, [[tobacco]], and [[fruit tree]]s. The Behunin family lived in Zion canyon near the site of today's [[Zion Lodge]] during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Isaac Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to a place of peace mentioned in the [[Bible]].

Two more families settled Zion canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other [[domesticated animal]]s. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909. 

[[Image:Crawford ranch in Zion Canyon.jpeg|thumb|left|The Crawford ranch was located near the mouth of Zion Canyon, in Springdale.]]The [[Powell Geographic Expedition]] entered the area in 1869 after their first trip through the [[Grand Canyon]]. [[John Wesley Powell|Powell]] returned in September 1872 and descended the East Fork of the Virgin River (Parunaweap Canyon) to the town of Shunesberg. He may have made the climb up to Zion Canyon, and named it ''Mukuntuweap'' under the impression that that was the Paiute name. In the same year, Geologist [[Grove Karl Gilbert]], working with the [[Wheeler Survey]], descended the North Fork of the Virgin River from Navajo Lake to Zion Canyon, making the first recorded descent of "The [[Zion Narrows]]". It is likely that he named this remarkable section of canyon in the process.

Powell Survey photographers, [[Jack Hillers]] and [[James Fennemore]], first visited the Zion Canyon and [[Kolob Plateau]] region in the spring of 1872. Hillers returned in April of 1873 to add more [[photograph]]s to the "Virgin River Series" of photographs and [[stereograph]]s. Hillers described wading the canyon for 4 days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs. Geologist [[Clarence Dutton]] later [[cartography|mapped]] the region and artist [[William H. Holmes]] documented the scenery.

====Protection and tourism====
[[Image:Zion_shuttle.jpeg|thumb|From April through October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles, and visitors ride the frequent shuttle buses]]
Paintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904, followed by a glowing article in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' the next year. That, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]]'s proclamation creating Mukuntuweap National Monument on [[July 31]] [[1909]]. In 1917, the acting director of the newly created [[National Park Service]] visited the canyon and proposed changing its name ''Zion'' from the locally unpopular ''Mukuntuweap''. That occurred the following year. The [[United States Congress]] added more land and established Zion National Park on [[November 19]] [[1919]]. A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on [[January 22]] [[1937]], and was incorporated into the park on [[July 11]] [[1956]].

Travel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917, to as far as The Grotto. 

[[Image:Zion National Park poster 1938.jpg|thumb|1938 poster of Zion National Park]]
By the summer of 1917, touring cars could reach Zion Canyon, and the Wylie Camp was established - a tent camp providing the first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon. The [[Utah Parks Company]], a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired the Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce]], Kaibab, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp. Architect [[Gilbert Stanley Underwood]] designed Zion Lodge in the "Rustic Style" and the Utah Parks Company funded the construction. In 1968, the main lodge building was destroyed by fire but was quickly rebuilt. The detached Western Cabins ([[:image:Western Cabins of Zion Lodge.jpeg|photo]]) survived and were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

[[image:Tour buses at Zion Lodge in 1929.jpeg|thumb|left|Tour buses at Zion Lodge in 1929. Tourism greatly increased after paved all-weather highways were built to Zion.]]
Work on the [[State Route 9 (Utah)|Zion-Mount Carmel Highway]] started in 1927 to provide reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park. The road opened in 1930 and park visitation and travel in the area greatly increased. The most famous feature of the highway is the 1.1-mile (1.8-km) Zion-Mount Carmel [[Tunnel]], which has six large windows cut through the massive [[sandstone]] cliff. On the south side of the tunnel, switchbacks take motorists from the tunnel to the floor of Zion Canyon. On the east side the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway terminates at Mt. Carmel Junction and Highway 89, allowing visitors to travel by car to other national parks, including Bryce Canyon and the Grand Canyon.

In 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon so he could travel on horseback up to the East Rim, and hence to Long Valley. This trail was improved again about 1925 and became the East Rim Trail. Other trails were built in 1925 including the West Rim Trail and the Lady Mountain Trail. The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there one mile to the start of the Narrows. The next year saw construction of the Angels Landing Trail, and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River. The Hidden Canyon trail was built in 1928. The West Rim and East Rim Trail were built for horse-back riding visitors, and were blasted out of the sandstone in many places.
[[Image:East portal of Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel in early 1930s.jpg|thumb|East portal of Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel in early 1930s. When it was built, the tunnel was the longest of its type in the world.]]

The original ranger cabin was built at The Grotto in the 1920s. A real visitor center was first built in the 1950s, facing the Temples and Towers of the Virgin. Park facilities were redesigned in 2000, with the visitor center converted to a human-history [[museum]] ([[:image:Zion National Park Human History Museum.jpeg|photo]]) and visitor center functions moved to a new [[solar power]]ed facility adjacent to the south entrance.

Zion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000. From April through October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles, and visitors ride the frequent shuttle buses. The new plan restored natural quiet to the canyon. 

On [[April 12]], [[1995]], heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.  Over a period of two hours, the river carved away 590 feet (190&nbsp;m) of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees in the Zion Lodge.  A one-lane temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.  A more stable, albeit temporary, road was completed on [[May 25]], [[1995]] to allow summer visitors to access the park.  This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.

The [[State Route 9 (Utah)|Zion-Mount Carmel Highway]] can be traveled year-round. Access for over-sized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles.

The 5 mile (8 km) Kolob Canyons Road was built in the mid-1960s to provide a scenic drive and access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park. This road often closes in the winter.

==Geology==
:''Main article: [[Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area]]''

[[image:The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon.jpg|thumb|280px|The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone.]]
The nine known exposed formations visible in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the [[Grand Staircase]]; they represent about 150 million years of mostly [[Mesozoic]]-aged [[sedimentation]] in that part of North America. The [[formation (geology)|formation]]s exposed in the Zion area were deposited as [[sediment]] in very different environments:
*The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) [[sea]] of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations; 
*[[Stream]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations;
*The vast [[desert]] of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations; and
*The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation.

Uplift affected the entire region, known as the [[Colorado Plateau]]s, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited. This steepened the [[stream gradient]] of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau. 

[[image:Kolob Canyons midway through Kolob Canyons Road.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau.]]
The fast-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, [[lava]] flows and [[cinder cone]]s covered parts of the area. 

High water volume in wet seasons does most of the [[downcutting]] in the main canyon and carries much of the 3 million [[short ton|ton]]s<!--short tons or metric tons?--> of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its [[tributary|tributaries]] can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in [[waterfall]]s from [[hanging valley]]s where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.

==Biology==
[[image:Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background.jpeg|thumb|Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland and coniferous forest habitat can be seen in this photo.]]
The [[Great Basin]], [[Mojave Desert]], and [[Colorado Plateau]] converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons. This, along with the varied [[topography]] of [[canyon]]-[[mesa]] country, differing [[soil]] types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. In 1999, biologists counted 289 [[bird]] species in the park. Seventy-five [[mammal]] and 32 [[reptile]] and [[amphibia]]n species are also found. These organisms make their home in one or more of four [[life zone]]s found in the Park: 
*[[Desert]] 
*[[Riparian]] 
*[[Woodland]] 
*[[Conifer]]ous [[forest]]

[[Image:SacredDaturaFx Wb2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Datura]] grows on the canyon floor and blooms at night.]]
Desert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. [[Sagebrush]], [[Prickly pear]] Cactus, and [[Rabbitbrush]], along with [[Sacred Datura]] and [[Indian Paintbrush]] are common. Utah Penstemon and Golden Aster can also be found. Milkvetch and Prince's Plume are found in pockets of [[selenium]]-rich soils. Common daytime animals include [[squirrel|Rock Squirrels]], [[Pinyon Jay]]s and [[Whiptail Lizard|Whiptail]] and [[Common Collared Lizard|Collared]] lizards. ([[:image:Collared lizard in Zion National Park.jpg|photo]]) [[Desert Cottontail]]s, [[Hare|Jackrabbit]]s, and Merriam's Kangaroo Rats come out at night.  [[Image:SquirrelAtZion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chipmunk]]s can be found roaming '''Zion Canyon'''.]] [[Cougar]]s, [[Coyote]]s, [[Gray Fox]]es, and [[Ringtail]]s are the top [[predation|predators]].

Cooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, between 3900 to 5500 feet (1190 to 1680 m). Stunted forests of [[pinyon pine]] and [[Juniper]] coexist here with [[manzanita]] shrubs, [[cliffrose]], [[serviceberry]], [[Scrub Oak]], and [[yucca]]. 

Stands of [[Ponderosa Pine]], [[Gambel oak|Gambel Oak]], manzanita and [[aspen]] populate the [[mesa]]s and cliffs above 6000 feet (1830 m).

[[image:Mule Deer in Zion Canyon.jpeg|thumb|[[Mule Deer]] graze throughout the area and are the most-often seen megafauna.]]
[[Golden Eagle]]s, [[Red-tailed Hawk]]s, [[Peregrine Falcon]]s, and [[White-throated Swift]]s can be seen in the area. [[California Condor]]s and [[Bighorn Sheep]] were introduced in the 1990s. Nineteen species of [[bat]] also live in the area. 

[[Boxelder]], Fremont Cottonwood, [[maple]], and [[willow]] dominate riparian plant communities. Animals such as the Bank Beaver, Flannel-mouth Suckers, [[Gnatcatcher]]s, [[Dipper]]s, [[Canyon Wren]]s, the Virgin Spinedace, and [[Water Strider]]s all make their homes in the riparian zones. [[Mule Deer]] browse on vegetation throughout the park.

==Activities==
For many, the highlight of Zion is a trip up the main canyon to the Temple of Sinawava, via the park-run propane-powered free shuttle buses (operating [[April 1]] to [[October 31]]) or driving in their own vehicles the rest of the year.  Spectacular, colorful sandstone cliffs soar into the sky above a flat-bottomed, forested valley floor.  

Driving through the east side of Zion to [[U.S. Route 89]] allows access north to [[Bryce Canyon National Park]] or south to the north rim of the [[Grand Canyon]].  Due to the narrowness of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and run through the tunnel during limited hours.

The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons. The Grotto in Zion Canyon and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated [[picnic]] sites. 

More than 150 miles (240 km) of maintained trails provide access to the roadless interior. Seven popular trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (9 hours round trip) are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park (near Cedar City). 
Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is a popular summertime diversion. Orderville Canyon, a narrower slot canyon, is also a favorite. Heartier souls can backpack down The Narrows from the top in two days, or hike down in one long day (12 hours).  Other popular backpack trips include the West Rim Trail and LaVerkin Creek/Kolob Arch.

Zion is a center for [[Rock climbing]], with short walls like Touchstone, Moonlight Buttress, Spaceshot and Prodigal Son being very popular.  There are many short free climbs, and a large number of hard, long aid climbs.  Rockclimbing does not require a permit, though any anticipated bivy on a wall does.  Certain areas are closed for raptor nesting in the spring.

Zion is the USA's most concentrated center for [[canyoneering]].  Popular routes like Pine Creek and Mystery Canyon were first descended in the 1950s and 1960s, with the last of the big drainages (Heaps) descended in 1982.  Zion has a concentration of about 50 technical canyons, characterized by downclimbing and rappels in beautiful sandstone canyons.  The most difficult canyons have long sections of entrenched narrows, with keeper potholes that require technical gear and specialized techniques to escape.[[Image:Angels Landing Final Acent.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The final ascent at the Top of the Angels Landing Trail]]

Lodging in the park is available at [[Zion Lodge]], located halfway through Zion Canyon. Zion Lodge is open year-round and has [[motel]] units, cabins, a restaurant, caf<U+00E9>, and gift shop but rooms fill up fast. Three [[camping|campgrounds]] are available; South and Watchman at the far south side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road. Watchman is the only campground in the park that takes reservations and Lava Point has only primitive facilities and is usually open from May to October. Camping in the backcountry requires permits.

Guided [[horseback riding]] trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November. The Junior Ranger Program for ages 6 to 12 is active from [[Memorial Day]] to [[Labor Day]] at the Zion Nature Center. 

Rangers at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center and the smaller Kolob Canyons Visitor Center can help visitors plan their stay. A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, run by the Zion Natural History Association, offers books, maps, and souvenirs for sale, with proceeds benefiting the park. The Association also runs the Zion Human History Museum.

Zion Canyon IMAX in nearby Springdale, features many interesting documentaries about the natural history of Zion Canyon and the American Southwest

Adjacent to the park on the south, is the town of [[Springdale, Utah]] which offers services such as lodging, food, and entertainment.  There is also lodging, food and entertainment offered on the east side of the park along the [[State Route 9 (Utah)|Zion-Mount Carmel Highway]] and in [[Mount Carmel Junction, Utah|Mt Carmel Junction]].
