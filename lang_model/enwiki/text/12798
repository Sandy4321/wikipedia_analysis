'''Thomas Rennie''' was a [[Canadian]] businessman and politician.<ref name=DiscoverFiley/><ref name=MountPleasantFiley/>

Rennie and his two brothers took over the operation of his father's successful seed business when [[William Rennie (horticulturist)|William Rennie]] retired in 1889.<ref name=MountPleasantFiley/><ref name=CanadianBioWilliamRennie/>
Rennie became chair of the firm in 1925, following the retirement of his older brother, [[Robert Rennie|Robert]].<ref name=RennieSeeds/>
Rennie would later become a director of the [[Canadian Seed Trade Association]].<ref name=HarvestOfGold/>

He was appointed a member of the powerful [[Toronto Harbour Commission]] serving as its chair for many years.<ref name=MountPleasantFiley/><ref name=RennieSeeds/>
Popular historian Mike Filey wrote that he was appointed in 1930, was promoted to chair in 1936, and served a total of seventeen years.  John McCutcheon, of [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], wrote that he was appointed in 1921, was promoted to chair in 1938, and served a total of twenty-six years.

In 1951 the Commission recognized Rennie's contribution by naming its [[Thomas Rennie (ferry, 1951)|most recent ferry]] after him.<ref name=DiscoverFiley/><ref name=BlogTO/>  Rennie's daughter, his only child, christened the vessel.

In 1946 Rennie and his older brother Robert  filed objections when Jaroslav Racek filed a request to change his name to Gilbert Rennie.<ref name=RennieSeeds/>  Racek was a naturalized Canadian of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] descent, who had lived in Canada for twenty-one years.  McCutcheon suggested their objections were motivated by bigotry.

:''Thomas and Robert Rennie filed objections that were couched in legal principles but were actually based, according to the lawyer for the Rennie brothers, upon the notion that people of foreign descent should not be allowed to assume the proud Scottish name of Rennie.
