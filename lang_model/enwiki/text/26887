'''''Super Columbine Massacre RPG!''''', abbreviated '''''SCMRPG!''''', is a [[role-playing game|role-playing]] [[video game]] created by [[Danny Ledonne]] and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine High School shootings]] near [[Littleton, Colorado]]. Players assume the roles of gunmen [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]] and act out the massacre, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins on the day of the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in [[Hell in Christian beliefs|perdition]].

Ledonne had spent many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and programming knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. ''Super Columbine Massacre'' was created with [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]]'s game development program [[RPG Maker 2000]] and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an [[artist's statement]] about the work after his identity was revealed. ''Super Columbine Massacre'' was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled hundreds of thousands of downloads.

Reaction to ''Super Columbine Massacre'' was conflicting; the title was criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent, and lauded as sophisticated and worthy of praise. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received acclaim as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for kids. ''Super Columbine Massacre''{{'}}s themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 [[Dawson College shooting]]s. Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, and produced a documentary in 2008 called ''[[Playing Columbine]]'' about his game and its impact.

''Super Columbine Massacre RPG!'' is a [[Computer role-playing game|role-playing game]]. Players control the actions of teenagers [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]]; the pair entered [[Columbine, Colorado]]'s [[Columbine High School]] on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library.<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens">{{cite news|author=Vaughan, Kevin; Brian Crecente|date=May 16, 2006|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4702205,00.html|title=Video game reopens Columbine wounds; Parents of victims are horrified; creator says it's for 'real dialogue'|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}</ref> Much of the game takes place in a third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a [[16-bit]]-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/>

When players engage in battle, the screen changes to a first-person view of the enemy; enemies are named by stereotypes or occupations, such as "Preppy girl", "Janitor", "Math teacher" and "Jock Type".<ref name="ars-review"/> Combat has two options: "auto play", where the game chooses the weapon to use, or "manual play", in which the player decides to use a hand-to-hand weapon, explosive, gun, or defensive maneuver against foes.<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens"/> Once a battle starts, it is impossible to avoid or escape; the player must kill the enemy or die. Text narrates battle events and actions such as finding a bag or gaining a weapon.<ref name="msnbc-push2"/>

As the game proceeds, [[flashback]]s occur showing events in Harris and Klebolds' lives which may have caused them to commit murder; real life events are compressed into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes.<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/> Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they are believed to have occurred; lines of the gunmens' dialogue is often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other.<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/> In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens"/><ref name="gamasutra-why you owe3">{{cite web|author=Dugan, Patrick|date=March 13, 2007|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070313/dugan_03.shtml|title= Soapbox: Why You Owe the Columbine RPG (page 3)|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=December 9, 2008}}</ref>

==Plot==
The game begins as Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' basement to plot a series of bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.

In the next scene Harris and Klebold are standing outside their high school. The player guides them to the cafeteria to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop for a moment on a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mosley, William|date=May 19, 2006|title=Outrage over sick net game|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|page=28}}</ref> After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.<ref name="gamasutra-why you owe3"/>

The game's second half finds Klebold alone in Hell. After combating demons and monsters from the computer game ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'',<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens"/> Klebold reunites with Harris, and they profess their enthusiasm for the opportunity to live out their favorite video game. The pair find themselves at the "Isle of Lost Souls", where they meet fictional characters such as [[Pikachu]], [[Bart Simpson]], [[Mega_Man_(character)|Mega Man]], [[Mario]] and real personalities including [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], [[JonBen<U+00E9>t Ramsey]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[John Lennon]]. Next, they deliver a copy of ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]'' to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens"/> before fighting a caricature of Satan. Upon their victory, Satan congratulates them for their deeds.

The game returns to Columbine High School, where a press conference addresses the murders.<ref name="rockymountainnews-video game reopens"/>  Some of the dialog appears precisely as it was spoken after the actual event, while other lines caricature the political forces at work in the aftermath of the murders. The conference references gun control advocacy, religious fundamentalism, and the media's implication of [[Marilyn Manson]] and video games as culpable in the shooting.<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/>

'They're susceptible to hyperbole and speculation' |work=[[The_Gazette_(Montreal)|The Gazette]]|page=B8}}</ref> despite intending ''Super Columbine Massacre'' to be the only game he created.]]
''Super Columbine Massacre'' was created by [[Danny Ledonne]] of [[Alamosa, Colorado]], then a student and independent filmmaker. As a high school student, the Columbine shootings resonated with Ledonne, who said that he himself had once been "a loner", "a misfit" and "a bullied kid" in high school like the shooters. "I was an easy target to be picked on, and that started in kindergarten," he said. "It was the kind of bullying that most kids who were bullied experienced ... When you get pushed every day, and when you are ostracized not once, not twice, but years in and out, your perception of reality is distorted ... These things really do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way," he said.<ref name="rockymountainnews-gamer was on"/>

In 1999, director [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s death and the [[Columbine High School massacre]] occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, he realized he was headed down the same path as the shooters. "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it was like I was looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," Ledonne said.<ref name="rockymountainnews-gamer was on">{{cite news|author=Crecente, Brian|date=May 26, 2006|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4722344,00.html|title=Gamer was on deadly road; Creator of download says Columbine was a wake-up call|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}</ref> He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 [[grade point average]] and was voted "most likely to succeed" by his peers. He studied film at [[Emerson College]] and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.<ref name="rockymountainnews-gamer was on"/>

In November 2004, Ledonne discovered a program called [[RPG Maker]], which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically.<ref name="rockymountainnews-gamer was on"/> Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge;<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/> with RPG Maker he was able to fulfill his ambition.

Many of the songs in the game are MIDI versions of 1990s [[grunge]] and alternative bands such as [[Radiohead]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Smashing Pumpkins]].

Ledonne added elements to the game to criticize subjects varying from public reaction to the disaster, to stereotypical role-playing game conventions.

==Reaction==
Initial reception of ''Super Columbine Massacre'' was generally negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbin's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said, "One of the girls who died [in the shootings] was a friend of mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again."<ref name="washingtonpost-shock anger over"/> The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game "disgusts me.

While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|author=Crecente, Brian|date=May 6, 2006|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/feature/columbine-survivor-talks-about-columbine-rpg-171966.php|title= Feature: Columbine Survivor Talks About Columbine RPG|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>

''Super Columbine Massacre'' was largely condemned by the press.

<blockquote>I think everyone who disses the ''Columbine RPG'' is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis [sic], the honesty, the beauty of its social commentary. ''Super Columbine Massacre RPG'' is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless is a work of art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.<ref name="wcg-columbinerpg"/></blockquote>

<blockquote>If one is interested in making something for the public to view<U+2014>be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society?

On another level, the entire correlation between the Dawson College shooting and my game is unfounded. [...] What else did Kimveer like? Black clothes? Goth music? Pizza? [...] If anything, the Dawson College shooting is proof positive that games like [''Super Columbine Massacre''] ''should'' be made; until video games are no longer among the "usual suspects" for homicidal rampages, the public needs to more carefully consider why interactive electronic media is somehow the manufacturer of [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|Manchurian Candidates]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Crecente, Brian|date=September 20, 2006|url=http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/danny-ledonne/feature-columbine-rpg-creator-talks-about-dawson-shooting-201829.php|title=Columbine RPG Creator Talks about Dawson Shooting|publisher= [[Kotaku]]|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

Developer Ryan Lambourn created a [[flash game]] called ''[[V-Tech Rampage]]'' in 2007, which allows players to control the actions of gunman [[Cho Seung-Hui]] in the [[Virginia Tech massacre]]. Lambourn professed empathy for Seung-Hui, and said that he was a target of bullying in high school. "No one listens to you unless you've got something sensational to do. And that's why I feel sympathy for Cho Seung-Hui. He had to go that far," Lambourn stated.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2114698,00.html|title=

===Slamgate and legacy===
In October 2006, Sam Roberts, the Guerilla Gamemaker Competition director of the [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance]] festival, emailed Ledonne encouraging him to submit the game to the contest. Ledonne looked at the selection of the game as one of the competition's finalists in December as evidence that "all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration (even painful topics like school shootings)".<ref name="ars-playing"/> The event's organizer, Peter Baxter, announced the removal of the game from the festival's "Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition" after its selection as a finalist. Several reasons for the change of mind were given, including threatened sponsor withdrawal, possible lawsuits, and "moral grounds";<ref>{{cite web|author=Bogost, Ian|date=January 23, 2007|url=http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000724.shtml|title=Super Slamdance excuses|publisher= Water Cooler Games|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref> Baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused the drop, instead affirming that "the shootings are still a very touchy subject, and rightly so.

[[Brian Flemming]], director of ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', saw Ledonne's demo of ''Super Columbine Massacre'' outside the festival, and convinced two fellow Slamdance film jurors to award the game a "Special Jury Prize" for Best Documentary, an unofficial award not endorsed by Slamdance itself. The jurors intended to present the special prize alongside the award for best documentary. Shortly before the ceremony, Baxter informed Flemming that he couldn't present the award due to "music clearance issues", and refused to allow it despite Flemming's protests. According to Ledonne, Flemming tried to hold his ground, but eventually gave in to Baxter's request.<ref>{{cite web|author=Orland, Kyle|date=January 31, 2007|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/31/columbine-game-blocked-from-receiving-slamdance-special-jury-pri/|title=Columbine game blocked from receiving Slamdance special jury prize|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=December 10, 2008}}</ref>

Ledonne produced a [[documentary film]] based on his experiences after the release of ''Super Columbine Massacre''. Titled ''[[Playing Columbine]]'', the documentary uses the controversy surrounding the game to investigate the large issues facing video games as a medium for artistic expression.<ref>{{cite web|author=Barker, Andrew|date=November 17, 2008|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939050.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=AFI: 'Playing Columbine'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=December 10, 2008}}</ref> The film premiered at [[AFI Fest]] in Los Angeles, California on November 7, 2008.

As a result of the controversy of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games.<ref name="deadly games-podcast"/> Keith Stuart of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, ''Super Columbine Massacre'' "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'"<ref>{{cite news|author=Stuart, Keith|date=January 11, 2007|title= Gamesblog: Sorry, Boris, these 'blasted gizmos' are here to stay |work=[[The Guardian]]|page=3}}</ref> Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as ''Super Columbine Massacre'' and the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' "[[Hot coffee mod]]" evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations.<ref>{{cite book|author= Jahn-Sudmann, Andreas; Stockmann, Ralf|year=2008|title=Computer Games as a Sociocultural Phenomenon: Games Without Frontiers, Wars Without Tears|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230545440|pages=10}}</ref> The game and others like it continue to be at the center of the video games as art debate,<ref name="msnbc-push2"/> and Gamasutra credited ''Super Columbine Massacre'' and Slamgate as having two highly positive and far-reaching effects; first, forcing print game journalism to focus on the issue; and secondly, the "evangelization of the notion that games can be as meaningful and important as other media, even if the example is offensive to the sensibilities of most Americans ... To win is to lose, but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored."<ref name="gamasutra-why you owe2"/>
