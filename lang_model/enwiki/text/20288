'''Dormancy''' is a period in an [[organism|organism's]] [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] when growth, development, and (in animals) physical activity is temporarily stopped. This minimizes [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] and therefore helps an organism to conserve [[energy]]. Dormancy tends to be closely associated with [[Ecosystem|environmental conditions]]. Organisms can synchronize entry to a dormant phase with their [[Ecosystem|environment]] through predictive or consequential means. '''Predictive dormancy''' occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase ''before'' the onset of adverse conditions. For example, [[photoperiod]] and decreasing [[temperature]] are used by many [[plant]]s to predict the onset of winter. '''Consequential dormancy''' occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase ''after'' adverse conditions have arisen. This is commonly found in areas with an unpredictable climate. While very sudden changes in conditions may lead to a high [[mortality rate]] among animals relying on consequential dormancy, its use can be advantageous, as organisms remain active longer, and are therefore able to make greater use of available resources.

== Animal dormancy ==
=== Hibernation ===
{{main|Hibernation}}

'''Hibernation''' is a mechanism in many animals to escape cold weather and [[food shortage]] over the winter.  Hibernation may be predictive or consequential.  An animal prepares for hibernation by building up a thick layer of [[body fat]] during late summer and autumn which will provide it with energy during the dormant period.  During hibernation the animal undergoes many [[Physiology|physiological]] changes, including decreased [[heart rate]] (by as much as 95%) and decreased [[body temperature]]. Animals that hibernate include [[bat (animal)|bats]], [[ground squirrel]]s and other rodents, mouse lemurs, the [[European Hedgehog]] and other insectivores, monotremes and marsupials.

=== Diapause ===
{{main|Diapause}}
'''Diapause''' is a predictive strategy that is predetermined by an animal's [[genotype]].  Diapause is common in [[insect]]s, allowing them to suspend development between autumn and spring, and in [[mammals]] such as the [[Roe_deer#Reproduction|roe deer]] (''Capreolus Capreolus'', the only ungulate with embryonal diapause), where a delay in attachment of the [[embryo]] to the [[Uterus|uterine]] lining ensures that [[offspring]] are born in spring, when conditions are most favorable.

=== Aestivation ===
{{main|Aestivation}}
'''Aestivation''', also spelled '''estivation''', is an example of consequential dormancy in response to very hot or dry conditions.  It is common in [[invertebrates]] such as the [[Helix (genus)|garden snail]] and [[worm]] but also occurs in other animals such as the [[lungfish]].

=== Brumation ===
'''Brumation''' is an example of dormancy in [[reptiles]] that is similar to [[hibernation]].<REF> [http://lllreptile.com/info/library/care-and-husbandry-articles/-/reptilian-brumation/ Reptilian Brumation]</ref><ref>[http://www.gctts.org/node/80 Brumation]</ref> It differs from hibernation in the metabolic processes involved.<REF>[http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDbrumate.html#Anchor-What-49575 Brumation]</ref>

Reptiles generally begin brumation in late fall (more specific times depend on the species). They will often wake up to drink water and return to "sleep".  Captive reptiles should not be offered food during this time, as the temperature is too low for them to digest their meal.  They can go months without food. Reptiles may want to eat more than usual before the brumation time, but will eat less or refuse food as the temperature drops.  However, they do need to drink water. The brumation period is anywhere from 1-8 months depending on the air temperature and the size, age, and health of the reptile. During the first year of life, many small reptiles do not fully brumate, but rather slow down and eat less often. Brumation should not be confused with hibernation; when mammals hibernate they are actually asleep, when reptiles brumate they are less active, their metabolism slows down so they just don't need to eat as often. Reptiles can often go through the whole winter without eating. Brumation is triggered by cold weather/lack of heat, and the decrease in the amount of hours of daylight in the winter.

== Viral dormancy ==
[[Virus]]es of the family [[Herpesvirus]] are notable for remaining dormant within [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the human body. See for example [[varicella zoster virus]], which in an individual causes first [[chickenpox]] then shingles ([[herpes zoster]]). Concerning viruses this dormancy is often referred to as '''latency''' or a '''latent''' infection. [[HIV]] produces a latent infection in lymphocytes,<ref name="pmid17049012">{{cite journal

This should not be confused with [[clinical latency]].

== Plant dormancy ==
In [[plant physiology]], dormancy is a period of arrested plant growth. It is a survival strategy exhibited by many plant [[species]], which enables them to survive in [[climate]]s where part of the year is unsuitable for growth, such as winter or [[dry season]]s. 

Plant species that exhibit dormancy have a [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]] that tells them to slow activity and to prepare [[soft tissues]] for a period of freezing temperatures or water shortage. After a normal growing season, dormancy can be brought on by decreasing temperatures, shortened day length, or a reduction in [[rainfall]].

=== Dormant seeds ===
When a mature [[seed]] is placed under favorable conditions and fails to [[germinate]], it is said to be dormant.  [[Seed dormancy]] is referred to as '''embryo dormancy''' or '''internal dormancy''', and is caused by endogenous characteristics of the embryo which prevents [[germination]] (Black M, Butler J, Hughes M. 1987). The oldest seed that has been germinated into a [[viable]] plant was an approximately 1,300-yr-old [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] fruit, recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern [[China]]. <REF>[http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/2/236 Long-living lotus: germination and soil {gamma}-irradiation of centuries-old fruits, and cultivation, growth, and phenotypic abnormalities of offspring], 2002, ''American Journal of Botany'' Vol. 89:236-247.</ref> Dormancy should not be confused with '''seed coat dormancy''', '''external dormancy''', or '''hardseededness''' which is caused by the presence of a hard seed covering or [[seed coat]] that prevents water and oxygen from reaching and activating the [[embryo]]. It is a physical barrier to germination, not a true form of dormancy (Quinliven, 1971; Quinliven and Nichol, 1971).

=== Tree dormancy ===
{{main|Vernalization}}
Tree species that have well-developed dormancy needs may be tricked to some degree, but not completely. For instance, if a [[Japanese Maple]] (''Acer palmatum'') is given an "eternal summer" through exposure to additional daylight, it will grow continuously for as long as two years. Eventually, however, a temperate climate plant will automatically go dormant, no matter what environmental conditions it experiences. [[Deciduous]] plants will lose their leaves; [[evergreen]]s will curtail all new growth. Going through an "eternal summer" and the resultant automatic dormancy is stressful to the plant and usually fatal. The fatality rate increases to 100% if the plant does not receive the necessary period of cold temperatures required to break the dormancy. Most plants will require a certain number of hours of "chilling" at temperatures between about 0 <U+00B0>C and 10 <U+00B0>C to be able to break dormancy (Bewley, Black, 1994)
