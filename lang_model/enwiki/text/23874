==Critical reception==
Hindu wrote:"first half of the film is the screenplay that allows no room for sluggishness or dampeners. The film moves on at breakneck speed and by the time you take a breather it's intermission".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2003/10/24/stories/2003102401450200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Ottran | date=2003-10-24}}</ref>
