The '''''Wave'' class''' was a class of [[replenishment oiler]]s built for service supporting the the [[Royal Navy]] during the later years of the [[Second World War]]. They were subsequently transferred to the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] after the end of the war, and went on to support British and allied fleet units in [[Cold War]] conflicts such as the [[Korean War]].

==Design and construction==
The expanding needs of the Royal Navy to carry out long range operations away from friendly fuelling and replenishment stations led to the ordering of a number of tankers of around {{convert|16500|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} displacement, able to carry {{convert|11900|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of [[fuel oil]].<ref name=Janes>{{cite book  |title=Jane's Fighting Ships|page=81}}</ref> These would allow the Royal Navy and its allies increased flexibility, particularly in the [[Pacific theatre of World War II|Pacific theatre]], where there were large expanses of water and few friendly fuel stations. A total of twenty ships were eventually built by three British yards; 12 by the Furness Shipbuilding Company, Haverton Hill-on-Tees, three by [[Harland and Wolff]] at their yard in [[Govan]], and the remaining five by Sir J. Laing & Sons Ltd, at [[Sunderland]].<ref name=Janes/><ref name=Colledge>{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy, Vol. 2 |pages=383-4}}</ref>

==Service==
13 of the 20 of the ships were initially built for the Ministry of War Transport, which assigned them to be operated by various merchant shipping lines. Consequently most were named with the standard MOWT prefix 'Empire'.<ref name=Colledge/> The remaining MOWT owned oilers were transferred to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1946 and all were assigned 'Wave' names.<ref name=Janes/><ref name=Colledge/> Several of the RFA ships served in the Far East during the Second World War, while the class was heavily involved in the Korean War. RFAs [[RFA Wave Sovereign (A211)|''Wave Sovereign'']], [[RFA Wave Baron (A242)|''Wave Baron'']], [[RFA Wave Premier (A129)|''Wave Premier'']], [[RFA Wave Prince (A207)|''Wave Prince'']], [[RFA Wave Chief (A265)|''Wave Chief'']], [[RFA Wave Knight (A249)|''Wave Knight'']], [[RFA Wave Regent (A210)|''Wave Regent'']], [[RFA Wave Laird (A119)|''Wave Laird'']] and [[RFA Wave Conqueror (A245)|''Wave Conqueror'']] all served there in support of allied fleet units and task forces.<ref name=Rottman>{{cite book |last=Rottman |title=Korean War Order of Battle |pages=143-4}}</ref>

The class began to be retired from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the late 1950s, with [[RFA Wave Commander (A244)|''Wave Commander'']] and [[RFA Wave Liberator (A248)|''Wave Liberator'']] the first to be sold for scrapping in 1959.<ref name=Colledge/> Most of the remaining vessels had been scrapped by the mid 1960s, but refits and modifications allowed several to continue in service until the mid 1970s, with [[RFA Wave Chief (A265)|''Wave Chief'']] the last to be retired, in 1974.
