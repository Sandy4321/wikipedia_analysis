'''Elgin railway station''' is a [[train station|railway station]] serving the town of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], [[Moray]] in [[Scotland]]. The station is managed by [[First ScotRail]] and is on the [[Aberdeen to Inverness Line]].

The station has two platforms linked by a footbridge, and a booking office/waiting room with a vending machine.

== History ==
{{Main|Morayshire Railway}}
Elgin was formerly served by two stations, one owned by the [[Highland Railway]] and one by the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] (GNSR). Lines went from Elgin to Lossiemouth (closed 1964), Keith via Craigellachie (1968) and Aberdeen via Buckie (1968) in addition to the present Aberdeen-Inverness route. The stations were located about 1 mile to the south of Elgin town centre, which made them inconvenient for local journeys, e.g. to [[Lossiemouth]], and bus services soon eliminated much of the local passenger traffic - passengers would generally only use the train service if they were connecting to long-distance trains.

The stations were less than 500m apart and linked by a footpath.
This situation persisted until 1968 when the GNSR station (known as Elgin East), opened on [[10 August]] [[1852]], was closed.<ref name=butt>Butt (1995). Page 90.</ref> The present station, formerly the West (ex-Highland) station, opened on [[25 March]] [[1858]],<ref name=butt/> was rebuilt in a modern style in the 1980s.

The GNSR station building is still used as office accommodation and stands on the site of the original [[Morayshire Railway]] station.
