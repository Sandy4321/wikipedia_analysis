'''Salatiga''' is a small town in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], located between the cities of [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo). It sits at the foot of [[Merbabu|Mount Merbabu]] (3,142m) and Mount Telomoyo, and has a relatively cool climate due to its elevated position.

=History=
King Bhanu (Raja Bhanu) declared the following on 31st date, 4th year of the ''Saka'' calendar, written in the ''Scroll of Plumpungan'' (Prasasti Plumpungan) in the ''Sanskrit'' language, written in native [[Javanese]]:

''Srir = astu swasti prajabhyah'' which means

''May you be happy! All the people''

Thus the ''village of Hampran (Desa Hampran)'' was conceived as the ''village of Perdikan (Desa Perdikan)''. The people of this village, who celebrate the ''goddess of Trisala'' called the village as the ''village of Trisala'' and in the years to come became ''Salatri'' and eventually '''Salatiga'''

In the modern calendar, the scroll is dated 24th July, year 750. This date has been officially marked as the birthdate of '''Salatiga'''. On 1st July 1917 the village of '''Salatiga''' was nominated as ''staads gemeente'' or small town, by the Dutch colony.

''Alternate version (myth):''

Once upon a time Ki Ageng Pandanaran, the first regency of [[Semarang]] was robbed by three muggers,  and thus named the placed ''Salah Telu''. ''Salah'' is ''wrong'' in English, and ''telu'' is    ''three'' or ''tiga'' in [[Indonesian]] and eventually became '''Salatiga'''

Today, '''Salatiga''' is one of between 35 provincial districts/cities in Central Java with population of 150,000 or less.

''[[UKSW|Satya Wacana Christian University]] (Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana, [[UKSW]], SWCU)'' is considered among the best in Indonesia, most notably known for its Electrical Engineering faculty. The university is also well known for its pro-democracy movements, and famous figures such as [[Arief Budiman]] and Ariel Heryanto who formerly taught at the campus.

In 1997 John JOI Ihalauw was elected Rector of the university in a controversial process and, backed by the military, ousted pro-democracy movements from the university including [[Arief Budiman]] and Ariel Heryanto, along with more than 50 lecturers. This group became known in Indonesia as the ''Kelompok Pro Demokrasi (KPD)''. The popularity of the university has since declined.
