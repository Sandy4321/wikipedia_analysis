==Ancient architecture==

===Prehistoric architecture===
{{main|Neolithic architecture}}

[[Image:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|left|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]]]]
'''Neolithic architecture''' is the [[architecture]] of the [[Neolithic]] period. In Southwest [[Asia]], Neolithic [[culture]]s appear soon after 10000 BC, initially in the [[Levant]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. There are early Neolithic cultures in Southeast Anatolia, Syria and Iraq by 8000 BC, and food-producing societies first appear in southeast Europe by 7000 BC, and Central Europe by c. 5500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the [[Starcevo-K<U+00F6>r<U+00F6>s|Star<U+010D>evo-Koros (Cris)]], [[Linearbandkeramic]], and [[Vinca culture|Vin<U+010D>a]]). With very small exceptions (a few copper [[hatchet]]s and [[spear]] heads in the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] region), the people of the [[Americas]] and the [[Pacific]] remained at the Neolithic level of [[technology]] up until the time of European contact.

The neolithic peoples in the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Syria]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Central Asia]] were great builders, utilising [[mud-brick]] to construct houses and villages. At [[<U+00C7>atalh<U+00F6>y<U+00FC>k]], houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. The [[Mediterranean]] neolithic cultures of [[Malta]] worshiped in [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|megalithic temples]]. In [[Europe]], [[Neolithic long house|long houses]] built from [[wattle and daub]] were constructed. Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in [[Ireland]], where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built [[long barrow]]s and [[chamber tomb]]s for their dead and [[causewayed camp]]s, [[henge]]s flint mines and [[cursus]] monuments.

===Ancient Egypt===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[Image:Egypt.MedinetHabu.02.jpg|thumb|right|Ceiling decoration in the peristyle hall of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], an example of ancient Egyptian architecture]]
In [[Ancient Egypt]] and other early societies, people believed in the [[omnipotence]] of Gods, with many aspects of daily life were carried out with respect to the idea of the divine or [[supernatural]] and the way it was manifest in the mortal cycles of generations, years, seasons, days and nights. [[Harvest]]s for example were seen as the benevolence of [[fertility]] deities. Thus, the founding and ordering of the [[city]] and her most important buildings (the [[palace]] or [[temple]]) were often executed by priests or even the ruler himself and the construction was accompanied by [[rituals]] intended to enter human activity into continued divine [[benediction]]. Ancient architecture is characterised by this tension between the divine and mortal world. Cities would mark a contained sacred space over the wilderness of [[nature]] outside, and the temple or palace continued this order by acting as a house for the Gods. The architect, be he [[priest]] or [[monarch|king]], was not the sole important figure; he was merely part of a continuing tradition

===Pre-Columbian===
[[Image:Palenque Overview.jpg|left|thumb|Overview of the central plaza of the Mayan city of [[Palenque]](Chiapas, Mexico), a fine example of Classic period Mesoamerican Architecture]]

Pre-Columbian architecture mainly consisted of [[Mesoamerican architecture]] and [[Incan architecture]].

Mesoamerican architecture is the set of [[architecture|architectural]] traditions produced by [[pre-Columbian]] cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures outside of [[Ancient Egypt]].

[[Image:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|right|upright|View of [[Machu Picchu]]]]

[[Incan architecture]] consists of the major construction achievements developed by the [[Incas]]. The Incas developed an extensive [[Inca road system|road system]] spanning most of the western length of the continent. [[Inca rope bridge]]s could be considered the world's first suspension bridges. Because the Incas used no wheels (the Inca, unlike many other large empires, never discovered the wheel) or horses they built their roads and bridges for foot and pack-[[llama]] traffic.

Much of present day architecture at the former Inca capital [[Cuzco]] shows both Incan and Spanish influences. The famous lost city [[Machu Picchu]] is the best surviving example of Incan architecture. Another significant site is [[Ollantaytambo]]. The Inca were sophisticated stone cutters whose masonry used no mortar.

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Parthenon-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Parthenon]] temple (5th century BC) in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]
{{main|Architecture of ancient Greece}}
The architecture and urbanism of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were very different from those of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] or [[Persian Empire|Persians]] in that civic life gained importance. During the time of the ancients, religious matters were the preserve of the ruling order alone; by the time of the Greeks, religious mystery had skipped the confines of the temple-palace compounds and was the subject of the people or ''polis''. Greek civic life was sustained by new, open spaces called the ''[[agora]]'' which were surrounded by public buildings, stores and temples. The ''agora'' embodied the new found respect for social justice received through open debate rather than imperial mandate. Though divine wisdom still presided over human affairs, the living rituals of ancient civilizations had become inscribed in space, in the paths that wound towards the ''[[acropolis]]'' for example. Each place had its own nature, set within a world refracted through myth, thus temples were sited atop mountains all the better to touch the heavens
The Romans conquered the Greek cities in Italy around three hundred years before [[Christ]] and much of the Western world after that. The Roman problem of rulership involved the unity of disparity &mdash; from [[Spain|Spanish]] to [[Greece|Greek]], [[Macedon]]ian to [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] &mdash; Roman rule had extended itself across the breadth of the known world and the myriad pacified cultures forming this ''ecumene'' presented a new challenge for justice. One way to look at the unity of Roman architecture is through a new-found realisation of theory derived from practice, and embodied spatially. Civically we find this happening in the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' (sibling of the Greek agora), where public participation is increasingly removed from the concrete performance of rituals and represented in the decor of the architecture. Thus we finally see the beginnings of the contemporary public square in the Forum Iulium, begun by [[Julius Caesar]], where the buildings present themselves through their facades as representations within the space. As the Romans chose representations of sanctity over actual sacred spaces to participate in society, so the communicative nature of space was opened to human manipulation. None of which would have been possible without the advances of Roman [[engineering]] and construction or the newly found [[marble]] quarries which were the spoils of war; inventions like the [[arch]] and [[concrete]] gave a whole new form to Roman architecture, fluidly enclosing space in taut [[dome]]s and [[colonnade]]s, clothing the grounds for imperial rulership and civic order.

This was also a response to the changing social climate which demanded new buildings of increasing complexity &mdash; the [[coliseum]], the residential block, bigger [[hospital]]s and academies. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built.

===Roman architecture===
[[File:SaintPaul on the inside.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] (385 AD) in [[Rome]]]] 
{{main|Roman architecture}}

The Romans widely employed, and further developed, the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] and [[dome]] (see the [[Roman Architectural Revolution]]), all of which were little used before, particularly in Europe.<ref><blockquote>''The Romans were the first builders in Europe, perhaps the first in the world, fully to appreciate the advantages of the arch, the vault and the dome.''(Robertson, D.S.: Greek and Roman Architecture, 2nd edn., Cambridge 1943, p.231)</ref> Their innovative use of [[Roman concrete]] facilitated the building of the many public buildings of [[List of ancient architectural records|often  unprecedented size]] throughout the [[Roman empire|empire]]. These include [[Roman temple]]s, [[thermae|Roman baths]], [[List of Roman bridges|Roman bridges]], [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Roman harbour]]s, [[List of ancient Roman triumphal arches|triumphal arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|Roman amphitheatres]], [[Circus (building)#List of Roman Circuses|Roman circuses]] [[palace]]s, [[mausoleum|mausolea]] and in the [[Late antiquity|late empire]] also [[Church (building)|church]]es. 
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The monumental [[Colosseum]], a [[Roman amphitheatre]] from the 1st century AD]]

[[List of Roman domes|Roman domes]] permitted construction of vaulted ceilings and enabled huge covered public spaces such as the [[Thermae|public baths]] like [[Baths of Diocletian]] or the monumental [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in the city of Rome.

Art historians such as Gottfried Richter in the 20's identified the Roman architectural innovation as being the [[Triumphal Arch]] and it is poignant to see how this symbol of power on earth was transformed and utilised within the Christian basilicas when the Roman Empire of the West was on its last legs: The arch was set before the altar to symbolize the triumph of Christ and the after life. It is in their impressive [[aqueducts]] that we see the arch triumphant, especially in the many surviving examples, such as the [[Pont du Gard]], the aqueduct at [[Segovia]] and the remains of the [[Aqueducts of Rome]] itself. Their survival is testimony to the durability of their materials and design.

==Asia==
===Persian architecture===
{{main|Persian architecture}}
[[Image:Persepolis recreated.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ruins of [[Persepolis]], approximately 2500 years old.]]
The pre-Islamic styles draw on 3-4 thousand years of architectural development from various civilizations of the Iranian plateau. The post-Islamic architecture of Iran in turn, draws ideas from its pre-Islamic predecessor, and has geometrical and repetitive forms, as well as surfaces that are richly decorated with glazed tiles, carved stucco, patterned brickwork, floral motifs, and calligraphy.
As such, Iran ranks seventh in the world in terms of possessing historical monuments, museums, and other cultural attractions<ref>[http://www.american.edu/ted/iran-tour.htm Virtual Conference<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is recognized by UNESCO as being one of the cradles of civilization.<ref>http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2631/pdf/i12.pdf</ref>

Each of the periods of [[Elam]]ites, [[Achaemenid]]s, [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]ns, and [[Sassanid]]s were creators of great architecture that over the ages has spread wide and far to other cultures being adopted. Although Iran has suffered its share of destruction, including [[Alexander The Great]]'s decision to burn [[Persepolis]], there are sufficient remains to form a picture of its classical architecture.
[[Image:Ctesiphon, Iraq (2117465493).jpg|thumb|280px|The ruins of [[Taq-i Kisra]] at [[Ctesiphon]]
(in today [[iraq]]) - an example of [[Sassanid architecture|Persian architecture]] during [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] period.]]
The [[Achaemenid]]s built on a grand scale. The artists and materials they used were brought in from practically all territories of what was then the largest state in the world. [[Pasargadae]] set the standard: its city was laid out in an extensive park with bridges, gardens, [[colonnade]]d palaces and open column pavilions. Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.

With the emergence of the [[Parthians]] and [[Sassanid]]s there was an appearance of new forms. Parthian innovations fully flowered during the Sassanid period with massive [[barrel-vault]]ed chambers, solid masonry domes, and tall columns. This influence was to remain for years to come.
The roundness of the city of [[Baghdad]] in the [[Abbasid]] era for example, points to its Persian precedents such as [[Firouzabad]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]].<ref>Islam Art and Architecture. Markus Hattstein, Peter Delius. 2000. p96. ISBN 3-8290-2558-0</ref> The two designers who were hired by [[al-Mansur]] to plan the city's design were [[Naubakht]], a former Persian Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a former Jew from Khorasan.
The ruins of [[Persepolis]], [[Ctesiphon]], [[Jiroft Civilization|Jiroft]],<ref>[http://www.payvand.com/news/05/jan/1290.html Discovery of brick tablet in Jiroft proves 3rd millennium BC civilization<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Sialk]], [[Pasargadae]], [[Firouzabad]], [[Arg-<U+00E9> Bam]], and thousands of other ruins may give us merely a distant glimpse of what contribution Persians made to the art of building.

The fall of the Sassanid Empire to invading Islamic forces ironically led to the creation of remarkable religious buildings in Iran. Arts such as [[calligraphy]], stucco work, mirror work, and mosaic work, became closely tied with [[architecture]] in [[Iran]] in the new era. Archaeological excavations have provided sufficient documents in support of the impacts of Sasanian architecture on the architecture of the Islamic world.
Many experts believe the period of Persian architecture from the 15th through 17th Centuries to be the most brilliant of the post-Islamic era. Various structures such as mosques, mausoleums, bazaars, bridges, and different palaces have mainly survived from this period.

Interior spaces in Persian architecture make optimal use of techniques for regulating light, temperature, and heat by usage of appropriate design and materials.

[[Safavi]] [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] tried to achieve grandeur in scale (Isfahan's [[Naghsh-i Jahan Square]] is the 6th [[List of city squares by size|largest square]] worldwide) knowledge about building tall buildings with vast inner spaces. However, the quality of ornaments was decreased in comparison with those of the 14th and 15th centuries.
In the old Persian architecture, semi-circular and oval-shaped vaults were of great interest, leading Safavi architects to display their extraordinary skills in making massive domes. Domes can be seen frequently in the structurae of bazaars and mosques, particularly during the Safavi period in Isfahan. Iranian domes are distinguished for their height, proportion of elements, beauty of form, and roundness of the dome stem. The outer surfaces of the domes are mostly mosaic faced, and create a magical view. In the words of D. Huff, a German archaeologist, the dome is the dominant element in Persian architecture.
Another aspect of this architecture was the harmony it presented and manifested with the people, their environment, and their beliefs. At the same time no strict rules were applied to govern this form of Islamic architecture. The great mosques of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Tabriz]] each used local geometry, local materials, and local building methods to express in their own ways the order, harmony, and unity of Islamic architecture. And thus when the major monuments of Islamic Persian architecture are examined, they reveal complex geometrical relationships, a studied hierarchy of form and ornament, and great depths of symbolic meaning. In the words of [[Arthur Pope|Arthur U. Pope]], who carried out extensive studies in ancient Persian and Islamic buildings.

===Indian architecture===

{{Further|[[Indus Valley Civilization]], [[Indo-Islamic architecture]]}}
India's urban civilization is traceable to [[Mohenjodaro]] and [[Harappa]], now in [[Pakistan]]. From then on, Indian [[architecture]] and [[civil engineering]] continued to develop, and was manifestated [[temple]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and neighbouring regions. Architecture and civil engineering was known as ''sthapatya-kala'', literally "the art of constructing".

According to J.J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson,<ref> O'Connor, J. J. and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_mathematics.html ''Overview of Indian Mathematics''], School of Mathematics, University of St Andrew, Scotland.</ref> the ''[[Sulbasutras]]'' were appendices to the [[Vedas]] giving ''rules for constructing altars''. "They contained quite an amount of geometrical knowledge, but the mathematics was being developed, not for its own sake, but purely for practical religious purposes."

During the [[Kushan Empire]] and [[Mauryan Empire]], Indian architecture and civil engineering reached regions like [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Statues of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] were cut out, covering entire mountain cliffs, like in [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], Afghanistan. Over a period of time, ancient Indian art of construction blended with Greek styles and spread to [[Central Asia]].

[[Indian architecture]] encompasses a wide variety of geographically and historically spread structures, and was transformed by the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that, although it is difficult to identify a single representative style, nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. It is a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from West and Central Asia, as well as Europe. It includes the architecture of various dynasties, such as [[Hoysala architecture]], [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] and [[Western Chalukya Architecture]].

Architectural styles range from [[Hindu temple architecture]] to [[Islamic architecture]] to western [[classical architecture]] to [[modern architecture|modern]] and [[post-modern architecture]].

The temples of [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] are the earliest known examples of [[Hindu temples]]. There are numerous Hindu as well as Buddhist temples that are known as excellent examples of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]]. The [[Church of St. Anne, Talaulim|Church of St. Anne]] which is cast in the Indian [[Baroque]] Architectural style under the expert orientation of the most eminent architects of the time. It is a prime example of the blending of traditional Indian styles with western European architectural styles.

===Chinese architecture===
{{Main |Chinese architecture}}
[[Image:Gugong.jpg|thumb|Inside the [[Forbidden City]]- an example of [[Chinese architecture]] from the 15th century.]]
From the [[Neolithic]] era [[Longshan Culture]] and [[Bronze Age]] era [[Erlitou culture]], the earliest [[rammed earth]] fortifications exist, with evidence that [[timber framing|timber architecture]]. The subterranean ruins of the palace at [[Yinxu]] dates back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC&ndash;1046 BC). In historic China, architectural emphasis was laid upon the horizontal axis, in particular the construction of a heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not as well emphasized. This contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings. The deviation from this standard is the tower architecture of the Chinese tradition, which began as a native tradition{{Fact|date=November 2008}} and was eventually influenced by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] building for housing religious [[sutra]]s <U+2014> the [[stupa]] <U+2014> which came from [[India]]. Ancient Chinese tomb model representations of multiple story residential towers and watchtowers date to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220 AD). However, the earliest extant Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]] is the [[Songyue Pagoda]], a 40 m (131 ft) tall circular-based brick tower built in [[Henan]] province in the year 523 AD. From the 6th century onwards, stone-based structures become more common, while the earliest are from stone and brick arches found in Han Dynasty tombs. The [[Zhaozhou Bridge]] built from 595 to 605 AD is China's oldest extant stone bridge, as well as the world's oldest fully stone [[spandrel|open-spandrel]] segmental [[arch bridge]].

[[Image:Iron Pagoda of Kaifeng 6.jpg|right|190px|thumb|The [[Iron Pagoda]] of [[Kaifeng]], built in 1049 during the [[Song Dynasty]].]]
The vocational trade of architect, craftsman, and engineer was not as highly respected in premodern Chinese society as the [[scholar-bureaucrats]] who were drafted into the government by the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]]. Much of the knowledge about early Chinese architecture was passed on from one tradesman to his son or associative apprentice. However, there were several early treatises on architecture in China, with encyclopedic information on architecture dating back to the Han Dynasty. The height of the classical Chinese architectural tradition in writing and illustration can be found in the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'', a building manual written by 1100 and published by Lie Jie (1065&ndash;1110) in 1103. In it there are numerous and meticulous illustrations and diagrams showing the assembly of halls and building components, as well as classifying structure types and building components.

There were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles; yellow having been the Imperial color, yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the [[Forbidden City]]. The [[Temple of Heaven]], however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets, a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surface of the walls, tend to be red in colour.

Many current Chinese architectural designs follow [[post-modern]] and [[Western world|western]] styles.

===Japanese architecture===
{{Main|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:Himeji Castle The Keep Towers.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Himeji Castle]] from [[Nishi-no-maru]]]]

Japanese architecture has as long a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. Influenced heavily by Chinese architecture, it also shows a number of important differences and aspects which are uniquely Japanese.

Two new forms of architecture were developed in medieval Japan in response to the militaristic climate of the times: the [[castle]], a defensive structure built to house a feudal lord and his soldiers in times of trouble; and the ''shoin'', a reception hall and private study area designed to reflect the relationships of lord and vassal within a feudal society.

Because of the need to rebuild [[Japan]] after [[World War II]], major Japanese cities contain numerous examples of modern architecture. Japan played some role in modern [[skyscraper]] design, because of its long familiarity with the cantilever principle to support the weight of heavy tiled temple roofs. New [[city planning]] ideas based on the principle of layering or cocooning around an inner space (oku), a Japanese spatial concept that was adapted to urban needs, were adapted during reconstruction. [[Modernism]] became increasingly popular in architecture in Japan starting in the 1970s.

==Islamic architecture==
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
[[Image:Selimiye Mosque, Dome.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]].]]

[[Islamic architecture]] has encompassed a wide range of both secular and religious architecture styles from the foundation of Islam to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures within the sphere of Islamic culture. Some distinctive structures in Islamic architecture are [[mosque]]s, [[tomb]]s, [[palace]]s and [[fort]]s, although Islamic architects have of course also applied their distinctive design precepts to domestic architecture.

The wide spread and long history of Islam has given rise to many local architectural styles, including [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], [[Architecture of Central Asia|Timurid]], [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]], [[Fatimid]], [[Mamluk]], [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]], [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]], [[Chinese mosques|Sino-Islamic]] and [[African architecture|Afro-Islamic]] architecture. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early Abbasid buildings, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia.

===Africa===
{{main|Architecture of Africa}}
[[Image:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|225px|thumb|left|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure
in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture.]]
Early African architecture consisted of the achievements of the [[Ancient Egyptians]]. [[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late nineteenth century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles. In the Western [[Sahel]] region, Islamic influence was a major contributing factor to architectural development from the time of the [[Kingdom of Ghana]]. At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques, as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]], with one centered on [[Friday prayer]].<ref>Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81</ref> The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.<ref>Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86</ref> [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenn<U+00E9>]] and [[Timbuktu]]. The [[Sankore|Sankore Mosque]] in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenn<U+00E9>]]. The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood. The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed mud, with hipped roofs of [[Roof shingle|shingles]] or palm leaves. The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]].

[[Image:Chartres cathedral.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Notre-Dame de Chartres]], [[France]] ([[1194]]-[[1260]]) - [[Gothic architecture]]]]
Western European architecture in the [[Early Middle Ages]] may be divided into [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], including [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]], [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]], [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian]], and [[Asturian art and architecture|Asturian]]. While these terms are problematic, they nonetheless serve adequately as entries into the era. Considerations that enter into histories of each period include [[Trachtenberg]]'s "historicising" and "modernising" elements, Italian versus northern, Spanish, and Byzantine elements, and especially the religious and political maneuverings between kings, popes, and various ecclesiastic officials.

Surviving examples of medieval secular architecture mainly served for defense. [[Castle]]s and [[fortified wall]]s provide the most notable remaining non-religious examples of medieval architecture. Windows gained a cross-shape for more than decorative purposes: they provided a perfect fit for a [[crossbow]]man to safely shoot at invaders from inside. [[crenellation|Crenelated]] walls ([[battlement]]s) provided shelters for archers on the roofs to hide behind when not shooting.

===Renaissance architecture===

[[Image:Cortile.del.belvedere.1.jpg|thumb|200px|The Cortile del Belvedere in Rome by [[Donato Bramante]].]]
{{Main |Renaissance architecture}}

The [[Renaissance]] often refers to the [[Italian Renaissance]] that began in the 14th century, but recent research has revealed the existence of similar movements around [[Europe]] before the 15th century; consequently, the term "[[Early Modern]]" has gained popularity in describing this cultural movement. This period of cultural rebirth is often credited with the restoration of scholarship in the Classical Antiquities and the absorption of new scientific and philosophical knowledge that fed the arts.

The development from [[Medieval]] architecture concerned the way [[geometry]] mediated between the intangibility of light and the tangibility of the material as a way of relating divine creation to mortal existence. This relationship was changed in some measure by the invention of [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] which brought a sense of infinity into the realm of human comprehension through the new representations of the horizon, evidenced in the expanses of space opened up in Renaissance painting, and helped shape new [[humanism|humanist]] thought.

Perspective represented a new understanding of space as a universal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' fact, understood and controllable through human reason. Renaissance buildings therefore show a different sense of conceptual clarity, where spaces were designed to be understood in their entirety from a specific fixed viewpoint. The power of Perspective to universally represent reality was not limited to ''describing'' experiences, but also allowed it to anticipate experience itself by projecting the image back into reality.

[[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Cortile del Belvedere]] project is one such instance where spaces were pictured/designed together before being built. Such a space was only possible due to the powers of abstraction, offered by perspective, that allowed the composition of heterogeneous activities into a metaphor for the legitimacy of current rule. The commission was set by [[Pope Julius II]] to connect an ancient pontifical palace on the right of St Peter's with the palace, built by Pollaiolo for Innocent VIII. In doing so Bramante organised the ascent through three courts that sees the lower, theatrical level move into the upper level through increasingly planned gardens thereby creating a tension between the human realm and an idealised vision of the "ideal city", Jerusalem, this is explicitly shown in Bramante's depiction of the ascent from the perspective of Pope Julius's bedroom window.

The Renaissance spread to [[France]] in the late 15th century, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] returned in 1496 with several Italian artists from his conquest of Naples. Renaissance chateaux were built in the Loire Valley, the earliest example being the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Amboise]], and the style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]](1515-47). (See [[Ch<U+00E2>teaux of the Loire Valley]]). The [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chambord]]) is a combination of Gothic structure and Italianate ornament, a style which progressed under architects such as Sebastiano Serlio, who was engaged after 1540 in work at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Fontainebleau]]. At Fontainebleau Italian artists such as [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolo dell' Abbate]] formed the First [[School of Fontainebleau]].

[[Image:Trinitylavra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]]]]

Architects such as [[Philibert Delorme]], [[Androuet du Cerceau]], [[Giacomo Vignola]], and [[Pierre Lescot]], were inspired by the new ideas. The southwest interior facade of the Cour Carree of the [[Louvre]] in Paris was designed by Lescot and covered with exterior carvings by [[Jean Goujon]]. Architecture continued to thrive in the reigns of Henri II and Henri III.

In [[England]] the first great exponent of Renaissance architecture was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573 <U+2013> 1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of [[Palladio]] was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works with their clean lines and symmetry, were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenelations and turrets.

===Baroque architecture===

If Renaissance architecture announced a rebirth of human culture, the periods of [[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]] that followed signalled an increasing anxiety over meaning and representation. Important developments in science and philosophy had separated mathematical representations of reality from the rest of culture, fundamentally changing the way humans related to their world through architecture.

===The Age of Enlightenment===

[[Rationality]] and the universals lead to the emancipation of history, [[Gottfried Semper]] leads the fray, filleting of "beauty" leads to contemporary notions of form, the seed of [[Modernity]].

===Beaux-Arts architecture===

''"What Style Shall We Build In?"'' [Heinrich Huebsch])

Beaux-Arts architecture<ref>The phrase ''Beaux Arts'' is usually translated as "[[Fine Arts]]" in non-architectural English contexts.</ref> denotes the academic classical [[architectural style]] that was taught at the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux Arts]] in [[Paris]]. The ''style "Beaux-Arts"'' is above all the cumulative product of two and a half centuries of instruction under the authority, first of the Acad<U+00E9>mie royale d'architecture, then, following the Revolution, of the Architecture section of the Acad<U+00E9>mie des Beaux-Arts. The organization under the Ancien R<U+00E9>gime of the competition for the Grand Prix de Rome in architecture, offering a chance to study in Rome, imprinted its codes and esthetic on the course of instruction, which culminated during the Second Empire (1850-1870) and the Third Republic that followed. The style of instruction that produced Beaux-Arts architecture continued without a major renovation until 1968.<ref>Robin Middleton, Editor.

==Modern architecture==
{{Main |Modern architecture}}
[[Image:1st-Unitarian.jpg|thumb|Frank Lloyd Wright's [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|First Unitarian Meeting House]], Madison, WI]]
Modern architecture is a term given to a number of building styles with similar characteristics, primarily the simplification of form and the elimination of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], that first arose around 1900. By the 1940s these styles had been consolidated and identified as the [[international style (architecture)|International Style]] and became the dominant architectural style, particularly for institutional and corporate building, for several decades in the twentieth century.

The exact characteristics and origins of modern architecture are still open to interpretation and debate.

The instrumentalisation of Architecture as argued under the [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] "[[form follows function]]".

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functionalism (architecture)}}
[[Image:Olympiastadionin torni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The tower of the [[Helsinki]] [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] (Y. Lindegren & T. J<U+00E4>ntti, built in 1934-38)]]

'''Functionalism''', in [[architecture]], is the principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. This statement is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

The place of functionalism in building can be traced back to the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] triad, where 'utilitas' (variously translated as 'commodity', 'convenience', or 'utility') stands alongside 'venustas' (beauty) and 'firmitas' (firmness) as one of three classic goals of architecture.

===Futurist architecture===
{{main|Futurist architecture}}
[[Image:Ferrohaus Zuerich.jpg|thumb|right|Ferrohouse in Zurich ([[Justus Dahinden]], 1970)- an example of futurist architecture]]
Futurist architecture began as an early-20th century form of architecture characterized by anti-historicism and long horizontal lines suggesting speed, motion and urgency. Technology and even violence were among the themes of the Futurists. The movement was founded by the poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], who produced its first manifesto, the ''Manifesto of Futurism'' in 1909). The movement attracted not only poets, musicians, artist (such as [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Fortunato Depero]], and [[Enrico Prampolini]]) but also a number of architects. Among the latter there was [[Antonio Sant'Elia]], who, though he built little, translated the Futurist vision into bold urban form.

===Expressionist architecture===
{{main|Expressionist architecture}}
[[Image:Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|[[Goetheanum]] by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1923]]

Expressionist architecture was an architectural movement that developed in Northern Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts.

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in [[World War I]] and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.<ref>Jencks, p.59</ref> Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid 1920s,<ref>Sharp, p.68</ref> resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,<ref>Pehnt, p.163</ref> and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate.

===International Style===
{{main| International style (architecture)}}
[[Image:Glaspaleis front-east.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Glaspaleis|Glass Palace]], a celebration of transparency, in Heerlen, The Netherlands (1935)]]

The International style was a major [[architectural style|architectural trend]] of the 1920s and 1930s. The term usually refers to the buildings and architects of the formative decades of modernism, before [[World War II]]. The term had its origin from the name of a book by [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Philip Johnson]] which identified, categorised and expanded upon characteristics common to modernism across the world. As a result, the focus was more on the stylistic aspects of modernism. The basic design principles of the international style thus constitute part of [[modernism]].

Around 1900 a number of architects around the world began developing new architectural solutions to integrate traditional precedents with new social demands and technological possibilities. The work of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] in Brussels, [[Antoni Gaudi]] in Barcelona, [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna and [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, among many others, can be seen as a common struggle between old and new.

===Tube architecture===
{{main|Tube (structure)}}

Since 1963, a new structural system of framed tubes appeared in [[skyscraper design and construction]]. The [[Bangladesh]]i engineer [[Fazlur Khan]] defined the framed tube structure as "a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation."<ref>{{Cite web| title = Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers| accessdate = 2007-05-14| url = http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm }}</ref> Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads, for example wind, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity.

The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the [[DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building]] which Khan designed and was completed in [[Chicago]] by 1963.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alfred Swenson & Pao-Chi Chang|title=building construction|publisher=''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83859/building-construction|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> This laid the foundations for the tube structures of many other later skyscrapers, including his own [[John Hancock Center]] and [[Sears Tower]], and can been seen in the [[construction of the World Trade Center]], [[Petronas Towers]], [[Jin Mao Building]], and most other [[supertall]] skyscrapers since the 1960s.<ref name=Ali>{{citation|title=Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers: from Ingalls to Jin mao|first=Mir M.|last=Ali|journal=Electronic Journal of Structural Engineering|volume=1|issue=1|year=2001|pages=2<U+2013>14|url=http://www.ejse.org/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm|accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> The [[architecture of Chicago]] employing the ideas developed by Khan is often known as the "[[Chicago school (architecture)|Second Chicago School]]".<ref>{{citation|title=The Tower and the Bridge: The New Art of Structural Engineering|first=David P.|last=Billington|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1985|isbn=069102393X|pages=234<U+2013>5}}</ref>

===Postmodern architecture===
{{Main |Postmodern architecture}}
[[Image:1000-de-la-gauchetiere.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[1000 de La Gaucheti<U+00E8>re]]'', with ornamented and strongly defined top, middle and bottom. Contrast with the modernist [[Seagram Building]] and [[Torre Picasso]].]]
[[Image:KyotoStation2a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kyoto Station]].|200px]]
Postmodern architecture is an international style whose first examples are generally cited as being from the 1950s, and which continues to influence present-day architecture. [[Postmodernity]] in architecture is generally thought to be heralded by the return of "wit, ornament and reference" to architecture in response to the formalism of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism. As with many cultural movements, some of postmodernism's most pronounced and visible ideas can be seen in architecture. The [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]] and formalized shapes and spaces of the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse [[aesthetics]]: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound.

Classic examples of [[modern architecture]] are the [[Lever House]] and the [[Seagram Building]] in commercial space, and the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] or the [[Bauhaus]] movement in private or communal spaces. Transitional examples of postmodern architecture are the [[Portland Building]] in [[Portland, OR|Portland]] and the [[Sony Building (New York City)]] (originally AT&T Building) in [[New York City]], which borrows elements and references from the past and reintroduces color and symbolism to architecture. A prime example of inspiration for postmodern architecture lies along the [[Las Vegas Strip]], which was studied by [[Robert Venturi]] in his 1972 book ''Learning from Las Vegas'' celebrating the strip's ordinary and common architecture. Venturi opined that "Less is a bore", inverting [[Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s dictum that "Less is more".

====Googie architecture====
{{Main|Googie architecture}}
<br clear = left />
[[Image:Seattle tower clear.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Seattle]] [[Space Needle]], built for Seattle's World's Fair, 1962- an example of [[Googie architecture]].]]
Googie architecture is a subdivision of [[expressionist]], or [[futurist architecture]] influenced by [[automobile|car]] culture  the [[Space Age]], originating from [[southern California]] in the late 1940s and continuing approximately into the mid-1960s. With upswept roofs and, often, curvaceous, [[geometric]] shapes, and bold use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[neon]], it decorated many a [[motel]], [[coffee house]] and [[bowling alley]] in the 1950s and 1960s. It epitomizes the spirit a generation demanded, looking excitedly towards a bright, [[technological]] and [[futuristic]] age.

As it became clear that the future would not look like ''[[The Jetsons]]'', the style came to be timeless rather than futuristic. As with the [[art deco]] style of the 1930s, it has remained undervalued until many of its finest examples had been destroyed. The style is related to and sometimes synonymous with the [[Raygun Gothic]] style as coined by writer [[William Gibson]].

====Deconstructivist architecture====
{{main|Deconstructivism}}
[[Image:ImperialWarMuseumNorth01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind]]'s [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Manchester]] comprises three apparently intersecting curved volumes.]]

Deconstructivism in architecture is a development of [[postmodern architecture]] that began in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ideas of fragmentation, [[Nonlinear (arts)|non-linear]] processes of design, an interest in manipulating ideas of a structure's surface or skin, and apparent [[non-Euclidean geometry]],<ref>Husserl, ''Origins of Geometry'', Introduction by Jacques Derrida</ref> (i.e., non-[[rectilinear]] shapes) which serve to distort and dislocate some of the [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]], such as structure and [[building envelope|envelope]]. The finished visual appearance of buildings that exhibit the many deconstructivist "styles" is characterised by a stimulating unpredictability and a controlled chaos.

Important events in the history of the deconstructivist movement include the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]] (especially the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]<ref>Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1997)</ref> and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s winning entry), the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]], and the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since the exhibition, many of the architects who were associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from the term. Nonetheless, the term has stuck and has now, in fact, come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

===Critical regionalism===
{{Main |Critical Regionalism}}
[[Image:Sydney Opera House Sails.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sydney Opera House]] - designed to evoke the sails of yachts in Sydney harbour]]
Critical regionalism is an approach to [[architecture]] that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of meaning in [[Modern Architecture]] by using contextual forces to give a sense of place and meaning. The term critical regionalism was first used by [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]] and later more famously by [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Frampton put forth his views in ''"Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points of an architecture of resistance."'' He evokes [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s question of "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture critically for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time should value responses particular to the context. Emphasis should be on topography, climate, light, tectonic form rather than scenography and the tactile sense rather than the visual. Frampton draws from [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] to supplement his arguments.
