The plant comprises six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE), and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] for planned maintenance.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Black, Richard |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate [[Nuclear_reactor_coolant#Water|coolant water]] through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the [[Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|reactors overheated]] due to the normal high radioactive [[decay heat]] produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).  

At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown.  Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently.  Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.<ref>F. Tanabe, Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology, 2011, volume 48, issue 8, pages 1135 to 1139</ref> 

As the water boiled away in the reactors and the water levels in the [[Spent nuclear fuel|fuel]] rod pools dropped, the reactor fuel rods began to overheat severely, and to melt down.  In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/06/japan.nuclear.meltdown/index.html?iref=NS1 |title=3 nuclear reactors melted down after quake, Japan confirms |work=CNN|date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110607005367.htm |title='Melt-through' at Fukushima? / Govt report to IAEA suggests situation worse than meltdown |work=Yomiuri |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> 

In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred.<ref name="IAEA15March"/><ref>[http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?]</ref> 

Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for [[radiation]] safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling.  The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance.  Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704021504576210251376606080.html Stricken reactors may get power Sunday], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 19 March 2011</ref>

Unlike the other five reactor units, reactor 3 ran on mixed core, containing both uranium fuel and mixed uranium and [[plutonium oxide]], or [[MOX fuel]] (with the core comprising ~6% MOX fuel<ref>{{cite news |url=http://safetyfirst.nei.org/ask-an-expert/what-fuel-mix-was-in-use-at-fukushima-and-was-that-a-factor-in-the-accident-does-the-united-states-use-mox-fuel/ |title=What fuel mix was in use at Fukushima and was that a factor in the accident? Does the United States use MOX fuel? |date=25 July 2011 |work=Nuclear Energy Institute }}</ref>), during a loss of cooling accident in a subcritical reactor MOX fuel will not behave differently to UOX fuel. The key difference between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission.<ref>{{X. Li, R. Henkelmann and F. Baumg<U+00E4>rtner, Rapid determination of uranium and plutonium content in mixtures through measurement of the intensity-time curve of delayed neutrons, NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS, 2004, volume 215, issue 1<U+2013>2, pages 246<U+2013>251}}</ref>

While water-insoluble forms of plutonium such as [[plutonium dioxide]] are very harmful to the lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. Plutonium dioxide has a very high boiling point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much less than that of [[iodine-131]] and caesium. A key difference between the Fukushima accident and the Chernobyl accident was that the Chernobyl explosion shattered the fuel and flung it out of the reactor building, while at Fukushima there was no steam explosion driven by the release of fission energy. During a loss of cooling accident, the fuel is not subject to such intense mechanical stresses, so the release of radioactivity is controlled by the boiling-point of the different elements present.<ref>J.-P. Hiernaut, T. Wiss, D. Papaioannou, R.J.M. Konings, V.V. Rondinella, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 2008, volume 372, pages 215 to 225</ref>

===Cooling problems===
Following the reactor SCRAM, operators activated the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) and the residual heat removal system and core spray systems were made available to cool the suppression pool; whether they were activated prior to the tsunami has not been made clear. The RHRS and CS pumps were knocked out of commission by the tsunami. With DC battery power remaining, the RCIC continued to keep the water level stable, and the operators switched to the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system when water level began to drop. On 13 March, the HPCI system failed, the reason for which is not completely clear due to instrumentation not being available. It is believed to be either due to loss of DC power due to depletion of batteries or to reactor pressure dropping below the level at which it can operate. Operators were unable to restart it as batteries were exhausted. After this the operators were unable to start the RCIC system and began injecting seawater. Although it was not clear at the time, some of the fuel in Reactor 3 apparently melted around sixty hours after the earthquake (the night of the 12th to 13th).<ref name="BBCConfirmMelt">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13497656 |title=Tepco confirms extra partial fuel rod meltdown at plant |work=BBC |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref>

Early on 13 March an official of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/12/us-japan-quake-nuclear-cooling-idUSTRE72B3GI20110312 |title=Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant faces new reactor problem |work=Reuters |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power.

===Cooling efforts===
Around 10:00 JST on 16 March, NHK helicopters flying 30&nbsp;km away videotaped white fumes rising from the Fukushima I facility.

On 23 March, black smoke billowed from Unit 3, prompting another evacuation of workers from the plant, though Tokyo Electric Power Co. officials said there had been no corresponding spike in radiation at the plant.

On 24 March, three workers entered the basement of the turbine building and were exposed to radiation when they stepped into contaminated water. Two of them were not wearing high boots and received [[beta ray]] burns. They were hospitalized but their injuries were not life-threatening.<ref name="Japan Times 2-6 sieverts detected">{{cite web|title=Level of iodine-131 in seawater off chart|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110326x1.html|work=Japan Times|accessdate=27 March 2011|coauthors=Kanako Takahara and Kazuaki Nagata|date=26 March 2011}}</ref>

From 25 March, the source of water being injected into the core was switched from seawater to freshwater.<ref name=110819e2/>

In August, TEPCO began considering changing the core injection method for the no. 3 reactor as it was requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized that this may be because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70<U+2013>80 degrees celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11092705-e.html |title=Plant status of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station|accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref>

On 17 April, remote control robots were used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections.<ref name=110819e2/>  On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 3 from 25% to 30%.<ref name=n1/> Radiation measurements of the water in the Unit 3 spent fuel pool were reported at 140 kBq of radioactive caesium-134 per cubic centimeter, 150 kBq of caesium-137 per cubic centimeter, and 11 kBq per cubic centimeter of iodine-131 on 10 May.<ref name="n4"/>

On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel "is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units&nbsp;2 and 3", which meant most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked.<ref name=WSJCoresDamaged/>  On 23 May, TEPCO reported that Reactor 3 had suffered a meltdown some sixty hours after the earthquake.<ref name="BBCConfirmMelt" />

On 9 June, staff entered the Reactor Building to conduct radiation surveys.<ref name=110819e2/>  On 25 June and the following day [[boric acid]] dissolved in 90 tons of water was pumped into the spent fuel pool of Reactor 3. Concrete debris from the March hydrogen explosion of the reactor building have been detected in the spent fuel pool. In June TEPCO discovered that the water in the pool was strongly alkaline: the pH had reached a value of 11.2. Leaching of [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) or [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (CSH) from the [[concrete]] could have caused this. The alkaline water could accelerate the corrosion of the [[aluminium]] racks holding the spent fuel rods. If the fuel assemblies would fall, this could lead to re-[[criticality accident|criticality]]. In the mean time preparative works began to install a recirculation cooling system at the fuel pool, that should be operational in the first weeks of July.<ref>[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_11.html Boric acid added to spent fuel pool of Unit&nbsp;3.]</ref>

On 14 July, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.<ref name=110819e2/>  On 1 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system, to a circulatory cooling system.<ref name=110819e2/>  After 2 July, the Reactor was cooled using fresh water treated by the on-site water treatment plant.<ref name=110819e2/>

On 11 January 2012, radioactive contaminated water was found in two underground tunnels. On 12 January, TEPCO admitted that around 300 cubic meter water had accummulated in an underground tunnel near reactor No.3, with electric cables. Radioactive caesium was measured in concentrations varying from 49 to 69 becquerels per cubic centimeter. Smaller amounts of contaminated water with lower concentrations caesium was found in a tunnel near reactor no.1. How the water could accumulate at these places was under examination.<ref>The Mainichi Daily news (13 January 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120113p2g00m0dm020000c.html 300 tons of tainted water found near No. 3 unit at Fukushima plant]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>
