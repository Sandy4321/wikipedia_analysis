The '''Vectron''' is a design of reconfigurable, modular Bo'Bo' multipurpose locomotive by [[Siemens Mobility]], intended to be the successor to the successful [[EuroSprinter]] family of locomotives. Diesel, DC electric, AC electric and multisystem locomotives were launched at the 2010 [[Innotrans]] trade fair.

==Background and design==
Around the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century Siemens successfully produced freight and passenger/universal versions of its [[Eurosprinter]] locomotive platform; initially made as single voltage machines for European state railways (Austria, Germany), later as multivoltage locomotives for cross border working; this design resulted in numerous orders from both state and private railways, as well as rail leasing companies, primarily in the [[European Union]] area.

Siemens identified the potential for further growth in the market, particularly in trans-Alpine freight (Northern Europe to Italy), railfreight from northern European ports into Europe and from Baltic ports into Russia, as well as the potential for growth in newer members of the European Union (Poland, Hungary etc.).<ref name="tec">{{cite press release | url=http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/industry/mobility/2010-06-vectron/Background_Siemens_Mobility_Vectron_EN.pdf | title=The Vectron <U+2013> Siemens<U+2019> new generation of locomotives for rail transportation in Europe | date=29 June 2010 | publisher=''www.siemens.com''}}</ref>

The design incorporates elements from previous Siemens locomotives -  the train control package and traction control system are from the ES64F4 and ES64U4 Eurosprinter models respectively, whilst traction system is derived from the ER20 [[EuroRunner]]. The cab and replaceable front end (buffer-bar) derives from the latest Eurosprinter model<ref name=rgi20100629>{{cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/siemens-vectron-locomotive-on-test-for-innotrans-launch.html | title=Siemens Vectron locomotive on test | date= 29 June 2010 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> i.e. locomotives such as the Belgian [[SNCB Class 18 (Siemens)|SNCB Class 18]] or Portuguese [[CP Class 4700]].

===Design===
The Vectron is designed to be easily reconfigurable to a variety of country or work specific configurations; reconfiguration to different safety systems is simplified with pre-designed mounting points for track equipment, modular safety equipment cabinets in the locomotive body<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/industry/mobility/2010-06-vectron/Press-Release_Siemens_Mobility_Vectron_EN.pdf | title=Vectron <U+2013> Siemens<U+2019> universal locomotive for rail transportation in Europe| date=29 June 2010 | publisher=''www.siemens.com''}}</ref> and a driver's desk designed for a wide variety of information equipment.<ref name="tec"/>

The locomotives are also available in a medium power ({{convert|5.2|MW|abbr=on|disp=/}}) version for regional passenger and medium freight work as well as a high power ({{convert|6.4|MW|abbr=on|disp=/}}) version. DC only versions are only available in medium power.<ref name="s1"/> The standard design speed is {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}, which can be upgraded to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} with the addition of semi-active yaw dampers incorporating a bogie<U+2013>bogie steering mechanism.<ref name="tec"/>

The main body of the vehicle is self-supporting, consisting of an underframe of three longitudinal [[sill plate]]s (centre and sides), side walls, transverse support members for the bogie pivots and for the transformer, and end sill plates. The roof is in three sections and is removable, the two drivers cabins also have a replaceable front end. The buffer beam section is also a separate part, which allows replacement if it is damaged in a collision.<ref name="tec"/>

The main compartment of the locomotive contains the electrical equipment except the main transformer and batteries which are located below the frame. All electrical components are placed in predefined locations on either side of a central aisle connecting the two cabins with each mounting position being reserved for a single type of equipment.<ref name="tec"/>

The bogies transmit tractive force through a central pivot. The traction motors are flexibly supported by the bogie frame, and are connected to the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] mounted reduction gears by a multiple disc coupling. A full hollow shaft (folded cardan) drive system is also optional. Mechanical braking is via wheel-mounted disc brakes. Electrical regenerative braking is also used.<ref name="tec"/>

The locomotives can work in double, multiple and push-pull formation with other Vectron, Eurosprinter and Eurorunner locomotives as well as some other locomotives fitted with the same [[multiple working]] equipment.<ref name="tec"/> The design also allows single cab version using a for use permanent double coupled locomotive working or for use with passenger trains with a blanking module replacing one of the cab ends.<ref name="in2012"/>

====Diesel versions====
A fully diesel powered version was launched in 2010. The design uses a {{convert|2.4|MW|abbr=on}}, [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] 16V 4000 R84 engine.<ref name="de"/>

A electric locomotive design with 180&nbsp;kW diesel engine for shunting operations was presented at the 2012 [[Innotrans]] trade fair.<ref name="in2012">{{citation| url =http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/2012/infrastructure-cities/2012-06-innotrans/rl-vectron-e.pdf| title = Background paper - Vectron: extended locomotive concept | date = Sep 2012| publisher=Siemens}}</ref>

==Variants: introduction and homologation==
The first locomotives of the type were AC and multisystem locomotives presented at the [[Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg-Wildenrath]] in June 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.railcolor.net/index.php?nav=1405330&id=2823&action=dview | title=Siemens Vectron revealed| publisher=''www.railcolor.net''| date=29 June 2010}}</ref> AC, DC, multivoltage electric system and a diesel engined version were officially launched at the 2010 [[Innotrans]] trade fair.<ref name="de">{{citation| url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/siemens-unveils-diesel-surprise.html| title = Siemens unveils diesel surprise| date =23 Sep 2010| work= www.railwaygazette.com}}</ref>

The Vectron design received certification to operate in [[Romania]] in 2012,<ref name="hol">{{citation| url = http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/materials/infrastructure-cities/icrl/newsletter/2012/2012-06-22-rail-systems-news-e.pdf| title = Vectron: first unlimited homologation | publisher = Siemens| work = Rail Systems News| editor-first = Ellen |editor-last=Schramke| editor2-first = Anne| editor2-last = Rommel |date = 22 June 2012}}</ref> the DC Vectron version also was [[Homologation|homologated]] for use in Poland in 2012,<ref>{{citation| url = http://logistyka.wnp.pl/lokomotywa-vectron-otrzymala-polski-certyfikat,178934_1_0_0.html| title = Lokomotywa Vectron otrzyma<U+0142>a polski certyfikat| date = 17 Sep 2012| work = logistyka.wnp.pl| language =polish}}</ref> and the design received [[European community]] certification for inter-operability on high speed rail systems.<ref>{{citation| url  =http://www.europeanrailwayreview.com/15665/rail-industry-news/vectron-first-locomotive-platform-in-europe-to-receive-tsi-highspeed-certification/| title = Vectron: First locomotive platform in Europe to receive TSI Highspeed certification| date = 17 Sep 2012| publisher = Siemens| work = www.europeanrailwayreview.com}}</ref> (EC Decisions 2002/735/EC and 2008/232/CE)

As of 2012 the design is also being tested for homologation in Sweden, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands.<ref name="hol"/>

==Operators and leasing companies==
In December 2010 [[Railpool]] ordered six 6.4 MW 15 kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz Vectrons for cross-border freight and passenger services in Germany and Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/siemens-wins-first-vectron-order.html |date=23 December 2010 |title=Siemens wins first Vectron order|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] }}</ref>

Italian private operator [[Fuori muro]] ordered two DC vectrons in March 2012 for delivery in late 2013.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/pressemitteilungen/2012/infrastructure-cities/rail-systems/ICRL201203006e.pdf| title = Market entry: Siemens sells two Vectron locomotives to Italy for the first time | publisher = Siemens|date = 20 Mar 2012}}</ref>
