'''Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|FRS}} (31 January 1911{{spaced ndash}}22 January 1980) was an Australian [[physicist]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]].

A graduate of the [[University of Melbourne]], Burhop was awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] to study at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]]. Under the supervision of [[Mark Oliphant]], he investigated [[nuclear fusion]]. He produced a non-relativistic theory of the [[Auger effect]] in 1935, followed by a relativistic treatment the following year. He later wrote a monograph on the subject. He returned to the [[University of Melbourne]] as a [[lecturer]] in 1936, and helped Professor [[Thomas Laby]] build up the physics department there.

During the Second World War he worked in the Radiophysics Laboratory in [[Sydney]], where he produced a laboratory model of a [[cavity magnetron]]. In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and [[reflex klystron]]s for [[radar]] sets. In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], which created the first [[atomic bomb]]s.

In early 1945, Massey offered Burhop a position as a lecturer in the Mathematics Department at [[University College, London]]. He fostered international cooperation in nuclear physics. As part of a five-nation study of [[K meson]]s and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years, his group produced a wealth of new results, including the first observation of a double lambda [[hypernucleus]]. He spent a year on secondment to [[CERN]], as secretary of a committee that recommended the construction of the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] and the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]]. In 1974 and 1975, an international team under his leadership carried out a successful search for the {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Lambda+}} (charmed [[lambda baryon]]).

== Early life ==
Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop was born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], on 31 January 1911, the third child of two [[Salvation Army officer]]s, Henry Augustus Burhop and his wife Bertha n<U+00E9>e Head.<ref name="adb" /> He had two older sisters, Edna and Vera.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11361845 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]  |date=20 September 1944 |accessdate=24 February 2015 |page=2 }}</ref> His family was not wealthy, and they moved frequently owing to the nature of his parents' evangelical work.<ref name="adb">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography  | last = Home | first = R.

He transferred to [[Melbourne High School]] for his final year.<ref name="oral" />

Burhop won a scholarship, and entered the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1928.<ref name="oral">{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/amad/nla.oh-vn2140577?searchTerm=Burhop+dies |title=Eric H. S. Burhop interviewed by Hazel de Berg for the Hazel de Berg collection |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |accessdate=25 February 2015 }}</ref> He initially studied civil engineering, but switched to science after two years, and majored in physics. In 1929, he was awarded a bursary that provided financial assistance. He graduated in 1931 with a [[bachelor of science]] [[BSc]] degree with [[first class honours]] in physics. He then earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), also with first class honours, in mathematics in 1932, and a [[master of science]] in physics in 1933.<ref name="adb" />

For a master's research problem, Professor [[Thomas Laby]] had Burhop investigate the probability [[K shell]] ionisation by electron impact by measuring the intensity of the resultant [[X-ray]]  emissions. This aroused an interest in the [[Auger effect]], a subject in which he would later become an authority. By contrast, his master's thesis on "The Band Spectra of Diatomic Molecules" had little influence on his later work.<ref name="bio">{{cite journal |title=Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop 31 January 1911 <U+2013> 22 January 1980 |first1=Harrie |last1=Massey |authorlink=Harrie Massey |first2=D.

== Cavendish Laboratory ==
[[File:Sir Ernest Rutherfords laboratory, early 20th century. (9660575343).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Ernest Rutherford's laboratory]]
The thesis was good enough, though, for Burhop to be awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]] to study at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] in 1933. The scholarship included a first-class ticket to London on the liner [[SS Oronsay (1924)|RMS ''Oronsay'']].<ref name="bio" /> At this time the Cavendish Laboratory was one of the leading centres of physics in the world. In 1932, Cavendish laboratory scientists [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] split the [[atomic nucleus]], [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]], and [[Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] confirmed the existence of the [[positron]].<ref name="oral" /> Burhop was supervised by a fellow Australian, [[Mark Oliphant]].<ref name="adb" /> He was initially assigned a task of investigating the diffusion of positive alkali metal ions on hot metal surfaces, but soon switch to a more interesting subject, the measurement of the [[excitation function]] for the pairs of [[deuteron]]s producing a [[Triton (physics)|triton]] through [[nuclear fusion]]:
::{{Nuclide|Link|deuterium|2}} + {{Nuclide|Link|deuterium|2}} <U+2192> {{Nuclide|Link|tritium|3}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|proton}}

Before coming to Cambridge, Burhop had not engaged in political activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced [[socialism]], and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.<ref name="bio" />

== University of Melbourne ==
Burhop returned to Australia in 1936, taking up a position as a [[lecturer]] at the University of Melbourne, where Laby was eager to build up the Physics Department by adding expertise in the latest developments in [[nuclear physics]]. He married his fianc<U+00E9>e, Winifred Ida Stevens, on 23 December 1936 in a Salvation Army ceremony. They had a daughter and two sons. He completed his Cambridge [[doctor of philosophy]] (PhD) degree under Laby's supervision in 1938.<ref name="adb" /> It was in three parts: "The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron"; "Some problems in atomic disintegration"; and "Note on the migration of atoms on a surface".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=39990 |title=The ionization and reorganization of an atom in an inner shell, with special reference to the Dirac theory of the electron ; Eric Henry Stoneley Burhop |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=26 February 2015 }}</ref> Burhop established the first research program in the field in an Australian university, employing scientific equipment that he brought back from Britain. The centrepiece of the research effort was a 300 keV accelerator that produced a homogeneous neutron beam, which he commissioned in August 1939. He gave lectures on modern physics to the undergraduates, and on [[quantum mechanics]] to the postgraduates.<ref name="adb" /><ref name="oral" />

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for [[aerial photography]]. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and [[Leslie H. Martin|Leslie Martin]] to work on [[microwave radar]] at the Radiophysics Laboratory in [[Sydney]].<ref name="bio" /> Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a [[cavity magnetron]] on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia.<ref name="Mellor">{{cite book |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/second_world_war/AWMOHWW2/Civil/Vol5/ |accessdate=25 February 2015 |series=[[Australia in the War of 1939<U+2013>1945]] Series 4 <U+2013> Civil |title=Volume V <U+2013> The Role of Science and Industry |year=1958 |last=Mellor |first=David Paver |pp=446<U+2013>450 }}</ref> In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and [[reflex klystron]]s from prototypes into production models.<ref name="bio" /> Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.<ref name="Mellor" />

== Manhattan Project ==
In January 1944, Oliphant had Sir [[David Rivett]], the head of the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]], release Burhop to work on the [[Manhattan Project]],<ref name="Binnie">{{cite journal |url=http://royalsoc.org.au/publications/journal_2000_on/139_p1,2_binnie.pdf |journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales |volume=139 |issue=419<U+2013>420 |pp=11<U+2013>22 |year=2006 |issn=0035-9173 |first=Anna |last=Binnie |title=Oliphant, the Father of Atomic Energy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/vSearch/1D95E8DBD173A89ECA256B7E001E3F8D?openDocument&start=1&Highlight=2,Burhop&SearchOrder=4 |title=Rivett to White |date=5 January 1944 |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] |accessdate=23 February 2015 }}</ref> the Allied effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s.

Burhop worked with [[David Bohm]] in Massey's Theoretical Group, studying the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as [[Bohm diffusion]]. They also studied the ionisation of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic [[uranium enrichment]] process such as [[uranium tetrachloride]] (UCl<sub>4</sub>) and [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>).<ref name="bio" /><ref>Wartime papers produced by Bohm, Burhop and Massey were collected and published in {{cite book |editor-last=Guthrie |editor-first=Andrew |editor-first2=R.

== University College, London ==

In early 1945, Massey offered Burhop a position as a lecturer at [[University College, London]], in the Mathematics Department, of which Massey was the departmental head. He had to wait until he was released by the University of Melbourne, and did reach London until after the war ended in August 1945. His wife and family, who had stayed in Australia while he was working in the United States,  joined him in London some months later.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="Australians Help in Research" /> Living and working conditions in London were much worse than in California or Australia. Wartime shortages persisted, and the college had suffered bombing damage, so the Mathematics Department were located in temporary quarters. He was promoted to [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in 1949. Massey became head of the Physics Department in 1950, and Burhop moved there too. He became a professor in 1960, and Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1967.<ref name="bio" />

Burhop listed "furtherance of international scientific cooperation" as one of his hobbies.<ref name="bio" /> He worked with the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[University of Padua]] to establish a high-altitude [[cloud chamber]] on [[Marmolada]] that commenced operation in 1953. In 1957, he collaborated with Occhialini and [[C. F. Powell]] on a five-nation study of [[K meson]]s and their interaction with atomic nuclei that went on for several years, and produced a wealth of new results, including the first observation of a double lambda [[hypernucleus]]. He spent the 1962<U+2013>63 academic year on secondment to [[CERN]], and was secretary of a committee chaired by [[Edoardo Amaldi]] that drew up its policy for accelerator development. The machines the committee recommended, the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] and the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) were built, and became an important part of physics research in Europe for decades to come.<ref name="bio" />

When Burhop took charge of the Bubble Chamber Group at University College in 1967, he was quick to grasp the advantages of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions, and steered the group towards participation in joint European ventures, using the [[Gargamelle]]. The group's discovery of [[neutral current]]s in 1973 was a milestone on the road to the theoretical unification of [[electromagnetism]] with the [[weak force]].  In 1974 and 1975, with the help of [[Robert R. Wilson]], the director of the [[Fermilab]] in the United States, an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop's leadership carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that [[neutrino]] interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10<sup><U+2212>14</sup> s) particles that could be detected with the use of [[nuclear emulsion]]. Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10<sup><U+2212>13</sup> s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the {{SubatomicParticle|Charmed Lambda+}} (charmed [[lambda baryon]]), with a flight time of 7.3<U+00B1>0.1 x 10<sup><U+2212>13</sup>&nbsp;s.<ref name="bio" />

== Social activism ==
Like many scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, Burhop was concerned about the dangers of nuclear weapons, and addressed over 500 public meetings to raise awareness of the subject. He had been a founding member of the Australian Association of Scientific Workers in 1939, and after the war became chairman of the Atomic Science Committee of the Association of Scientific Workers, and a member of its Science Policy Committee, in Britain. In this capacity he helped organise the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] in 1957.<ref name="bio" /> He founded the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in 1969.<ref name="adb" /> He was president of his local branch of the [[Association of University Teachers]] from 1970 to 1972,<ref name="bio" /> and of the [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]] from 1971 to 1980.<ref name="adb" />

The [[Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO) opened a file on Burhop in 1948.<ref name="adb" />  In July 1951, the British government cancelled his passport when he accepted an offer to travel to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18228040 |title="Not Sinister", Says Dr.Burhop. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=23 July 1951 |accessdate=26 February 2015 |page=3 }}</ref> A new passport was issued after he gave the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] a written assurance that he would not seek to travel to the Soviet Union or other [[Iron Curtain]] countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27031072 |title=Dr. Burhop To Get New British Passport. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]  |date=27 August 1951 |accessdate=26 February 2015 |page=7 }}</ref>

Over the years Burhop received a number of honours and awards. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1963,<ref name="adb" /> and delivered its [[Rutherford Memorial Lecture]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rutherford Memorial Lecture, 1979.
