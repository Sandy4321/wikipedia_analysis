'''William Todd Akin''' (born July 5, 1947), is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MO|2}}, serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

The district includes the western [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] suburbs of [[Ballwin, Missouri|Ballwin]], [[Kirkwood, Missouri|Kirkwood]], [[Chesterfield, Missouri|Chesterfield]], [[Wildwood, Missouri|Wildwood]], [[Town and Country, Missouri|Town and Country]], and [[Des Peres, Missouri|Des Peres]] located along Interstate 270 in West County and the northwestern exurbs of [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]] and [[St. Peters, Missouri|St. Peters]] in [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]].

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[New York City]], Akin later moved to St. Louis and attended [[John Burroughs School]]. After graduating, he attended the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]  where he earned a degree in management engineering, and in 1984 he earned a [[Master of Divinity]] degree at [[Covenant Theological Seminary]] in St. Louis. During college he was member of [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity.  

== Career prior to Congress ==
From 1972 to 1980, Akin served in the [[Missouri National Guard]].<ref name="navyleague">{{cite web| title = Veterans in the US House of Representatives 109th Congress| publisher = Navy League| url = http://www.navyleague.org/legislative_affairs/HouseVets.pdf| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070626235918/http://www.navyleague.org/legislative_affairs/HouseVets.pdf| archivedate = 2007-06-26| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref> After his military career, he took up work at [[IBM]] as an engineer and later became a manager at Laclede Steel.

==Missouri legislature==
Akin was elected to the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] representing western [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] (West County) in 1988. He was reeelected five times.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Akin is listed in the House roll as "R-St. Louis."  The likely reason is that many areas in the [[St. Louis County]] portion of the district, including one of his district offices, have St. Louis addresses, even though the district does not include any part of the city of St. Louis itself.

===Elections===
In 2000, Republican [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jim Talent]] vacated the seat in his unsuccessful run for [[Governor of Missouri]]. Akin won a closely contested Republican [[primary election]] to replace Talent, defeating former St. Louis County Executive [[Gene McNary]] and [[Missouri Senate|State Senator]] Franc Flotron.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Representative - District 2 - Summary|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=13&oid=3681&arc=1|publisher=Office of Secretary of State, Missouri|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> He defeated Democratic State Senator Ted House in the general election, winning 55 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Representative - District 2 - Summary|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=14&oid=3986&arc=1|publisher=Office of Secretary of State, Missouri|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref> In 2010, Akin won re-election with 67.9% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web

===Political positions and actions ===
As a [[Missouri House of Representatives|State Representative]], Akin earned a reputation as one of the most [[Conservatism|conservative]] members of the Republican caucus. Akin was an outspoken opponent of [[abortion]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]], a supporter of the [[right to keep and bear arms]], and is generally opposed to increases in taxation and spending. As a U.S. Representative, he has continued to support these views, earning a 96% rating from the [[American Conservative Union]] in 2008, and 100% in 2007.<ref name="Barone2010">{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |coauthors=[[Richard E.

==U.S. Senate candidacy==

In mid-May 2011, Akin announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination in 2012 to unseat first term Democratic Senator [[Claire McCaskill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heartlandconnection.com/news/politics/story.aspx?id=620566|title=Congressman running for Senate introduces himself to the Heartland|published=KTVO-TV Heartland Connection.com|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> Likely competition in the August 2012 Republican primary include [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] businessman John Brunner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/todd_akin_announces_missouri_senate_bid-205681-1.html|title=Todd Akin announces Missouri Senate bid|publisher=RollCall.com|date=2011-05-17|accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> and former [[State Treasurer of Missouri| Missouri Treasurer]] [[Sarah Steelman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/1210/Inaugural_scoop_Steelman_files_for_Senate.html|title=Inaugural scoop: Steelman files for Senate|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=David|last=Catanese}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
===Home of record ===
In May, 2011 questions were raised about Akin's official address for voting. According to the [[Associated Press]] and [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], Akin has continued to list his family home in the Town and Country section of [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] as his home of record, despite having lived in the suburb of [[Wildwood, Missouri|Wildwood]] since at least 2009, and perhaps as early as 2007, when he and his wife purchased a home there. As recently as April 2011, Akin signed a polling place log book attesting to his living in Town and Country. According to the [[Missouri Secretary of State]]'s office, anyone knowingly giving false information to election workers is guilty of a felony violation of state election laws. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_a4e87e23-6e54-5f0c-a5fe-28367ef2ba75.html|title=Todd Akin votes in Town and Country|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch website|date= 2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Missouri-Rep-Akin-voting-living-at-different-places-122872884.html|title=Missouri Rep. Akin voting, living at different places.|publisher=Associated Press via KMOV-TV|date=2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref>

=== Liberalism and God ===
In late June 2011, Akin was discussing [[NBC television|NBC's]] recent removal of the words "under God" from a video clip of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. Akin told radio host [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] of the [[Family Research Council]] that:

<blockquote>Well, I think NBC has a long record of being very liberal, and at the heart of liberalism really is a hatred for God and a belief that government should replace God," Akin . "This is a systematic effort to try to separate our faith and God, which is a source in our belief in individual liberties, from our country. And when you do that you tear the heart out of our country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/28/lawmaker-apologizes-for-liberal-hatred-god-quip/ |publisher=Fox News |title=Lawmaker Apologizes for Liberal 'Hatred of God' Quip |author=Colby Hochmuth |date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-27}}</ref></blockquote>

Two days later, Aiken said in a radio interview there he would not apologize, since he meant that not all liberals hate God, only that liberals have "a hatred for public references for God." The next day, he said: 

<blockquote>People who know me and my family know that we take our faith and beliefs very seriously. As Christians, we would never question the sincerity of anyone's personal relationship with God. My statement during my radio interview was directed at the political movement, Liberalism, not at any specific individual. If my statement gave a different impression, I offer my apologies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_257a8021-15ab-5006-9245-cca7ad534d62.html |title=Akin changes course, apologizes for comment|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |author=Jason Hancock |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-27}}</ref></blockquote>

In August 2011, a group of local pastors was still trying to arrange a meeting with Aiken to discuss his statement and apology.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clergy Still Trying to Meet With Akin Over 'Hatred of God' Statement |author=Brian Kelly |date=August 19, 2011 |publisher =CBS St. Louis |accessdate=2011-08-27 |url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2011/08/19/clergy-still-trying-to-meet-with-akin-over-hatred-of-god-statement/}} </ref>
