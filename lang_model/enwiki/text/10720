The '''Forchbahn''' ([[German language|German]] for "Forch railway") is a {{RailGauge|1}} gauge narrow-gauge (''Schmalspurbahn'') light railway in the [[canton of Z<U+00FC>rich]], linking central Z<U+00FC>rich ([[Z<U+00FC>rich Stadelhofen]]) to the eastern suburbs near [[Esslingen, Switzerland|Esslingen]] via [[Forch]]. The name is often abbreviated to just '''FB''', which also appears on the trains. Locals call the train "Auntie Frieda" ("Tante Frieda"). 

== History ==
It opened on November 27, 1912, with the trip taking 67 minutes. By 2002, this had been reduced to just 36 minutes, partly due to new rolling stock. 

Between 1973 and 1976 a tunnel was built under [[Zumikon]] to reduce noise pollution in the town. The Forchbahn has two adjacent underground stops: Zumikon and Maiacher.

In 1976, a regular 15-minute train frequency was introduced. This is now standard throughout the daytime between [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] and [[Forch]]. During rush hours, the 15-minute frequency is extended to the whole route. There is now a night Forchbahn as well with an hourly frequency, from 1 AM to 4 AM.

Projected extensions to [[Z<U+00FC>rich Hauptbahnhof]] and [[Wetzikon]] were under consideration as early as 1979. However, they have yet to become reality.

In 1990, the line was added to the [[Z<U+00FC>rcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] transportation network. Forchbahn is providing the line S18 of the [[S-Bahn Z<U+00FC>rich]], sharing the tracks between Z<U+00FC>rich Stadelhofen station and Rehalp with [[Z<U+00FC>rich trams]].
