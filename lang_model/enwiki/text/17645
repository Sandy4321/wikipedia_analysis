==Playing career==
===Junior and college===
Nystrom established a hard-working style similar to his father's, which helped earn him an invite to play with the [[USA Hockey|US National Development Program]] (USDP).<ref name="USAToday2000" /> He played 55 games for USDP in the [[North American Hockey League]] in 1999<U+2013>2000, scoring seven goals and 23 points.<ref name="LOH">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=20519 |title=Eric Nystrom player profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref> He split the 2000<U+2013>01 season with the national under-18 program and the junior team in the [[United States Hockey League]], also representing the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]] at the [[2001 IIHF World U18 Championships]].<ref name="LOH" /> He later represented the United States at the [[2002 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2002]] and [[2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/120402aaa.html |title=Helminen, Nystrom named to U.S. National Junior Team |publisher=University of Michigan |date=December 4, 2002 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>

Upon turning professional in 2005, Nystrom was assigned to the [[Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He was recalled by the Flames at the start of the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]] and made his NHL debut against the [[Colorado Avalanche]] on October 10, 2005.<ref name="MGBio" />  He played two games with the Flames before being returned to the AHL to complete the season.<ref name="LOH" />  Nystrom missed most of the 2006<U+2013>07 after suffering a tear in his right shoulder during a pre-season game.  He attempted to rehab the injury and then play, before opting on surgery.  The injury limited Nystrom to just 12 regular season games for Omaha, but he returned in time to play five playoff games for the Knights.<ref>{{cite web |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Calgary/2007/09/07/4476970-sun.html |title=Nystrom hungry to shoulder the load |work=Calgary Sun |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>

Nystrom split the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08 season]] between the Calgary and the [[Quad City Flames]].  He appeared in 44 regular season games for Calgary, and scored his first NHL goal on October 30, 2007, against the [[Nashville Predators]].<ref name="MGBio" />  He scored a career-high four points, two goals and two assists, in the Flames final game of the regular season, a 7<U+2013>1 victory over the [[Vancouver Canucks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=280405022 |title=Iginla nets 50th goal of year, two assists as Flames roll in regular season finale |publisher=ESPN |date=April 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>  Following the season, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Flames.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Jean |url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/calgary-flames/story.html?id=1611e924-f16f-4bcf-9a05-22e85cbd8761&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.com%2Fcalgaryherald%2Fnews%2Fsports%2Fflames%2Ftopstories.atom%3Fviewer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fhockey%2Fteams%2Fcalgary-flames%2Fstory.html |title=Nystrom's back and ready for more ice time |work=Calgary Herald |date=June 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>  

Nystrom played his first full NHL season with the Flames in [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09]], playing in 76 games and scoring five goals, three of them game-winning.  He added a fourth game-winning goal in the [[2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs]] against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].<ref name="MGBio" /> He more than doubled his career high in [[2009<U+2013>10 NHL season|2009<U+2013>10]], scoring 11 goals despite struggling through a groin injury for a large part of the season. He was invited to play with the American team at the [[2010 IIHF World Championship]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Busby |first=Ian |url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2010/04/14/13586966.html |title=Nystrom not aiming for the Isles |work=Toronto Sun |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Minnesota and Dallas===
Nystrom chose to leave Calgary as a [[free agent]], signing a three-year, $4.2 million contract with the [[Minnesota Wild]] on July 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andreson |first=Glen |url=http://wild.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=533614 |title=Wild signs LW Eric Nystrom |publisher=Minnesota Wild Hockey Club |date=July 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> He scored four goals and eight assists in first season with the Wild,<ref name="LOH" /> a season which Nystrom admitted was not good, and "snowballed negatively" for him.<ref name="DallasCareerHigh">{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Steve |url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=614541 |title=Career High in Goals Just Starting Point for Nystrom |publisher=Dallas Stars Hockey Club |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> The [[2011<U+2013>12 NHL season|2011<U+2013>12 season]] posed early challenges for Nystrom.  In a pre-season game against the [[Edmonton Oilers]], his attempt to avoid an [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] call resulted in his stick getting caught up in the skates of Edmonton's [[Taylor Fedun]], sending the latter player crashing into the boards at high speed.  Fedun suffered a broken leg and the play renewed calls for the NHL to move to no-touch icing to avoid similar incidents in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/7041160/oilers-defenseman-taylor-fedun-taken-ice-stretcher |title=Taylor Fedun breaks leg |publisher=ESPN |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>  He was [[Waivers (NHL)|waived]] by Minnesota prior to the season's start, but went unclaimed by any other team and was demoted to the AHL's [[Houston Aeros]], with whom he appeared in one game.<ref name="DallasTrade">{{cite news |last=Brehm |first=Mike |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2011-10-12/notes-eric-nystrom-trade/50747782/1 |title=Stars trade for Eric Nystrom |work=USA Today |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>

On October 12, 2011, the Wild dealt him to the [[Dallas Stars]].  Minnesota had to place him through re-entry waivers first, and while Dallas could have claimed him at that point and been responsible for only half of his $1.4 million salary, they took on his full salary via trade so as to meet the league's minimum payroll rules.<ref name="DallasTrade" /> Dallas general manager [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] praised Nystrom as being an effective penalty killer who would add depth to his team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=377934 |title=Stars acquire forward Nystrom from Wild |publisher=The Sports Network |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>  Though he was anticipated to play in a defensive checking role, Nystrom added an offensive touch for Dallas, scoring 10 goals in his first 21 games with the team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Staple |first=Arthur |url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/eric-nystrom-finding-a-place-with-stars-1.3364750 |title=Eric Nystrom finding a place with Stars |work=Newsday |date=December 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>  His 12th goal of the season set a new career high,<ref name="DallasCareerHigh" /> and he finished the year with 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470180 |title=Eric Nystrom profile |work=National Hockey League |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>

==Off the ice==
Nystrom has frequently involved himself with charitable endeavors throughout his career. While with Quad City, he performed an on-ice striptease that mimicked the one performed by the character Ned Braden in the movie ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]'' as part of a team jersey auction.  The event raised $30,000.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cruickshank |first=Scott |url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/calgary-flames/story.html?id=2df0c2b4-c6f6-40c1-a91b-c6828107680f&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.com%2Fcalgaryherald%2Fnews%2Fsports%2Fflames%2Ftopstories.atom%3Fviewer%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fhockey%2Fteams%2Fcalgary-flames%2Fstory.html |title=Nystrom striptease scores for charity |work=Calgary Herald |date=March 1, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref> He served as a player ambassador for the ''Reading...
