According to an author interview, Jeff Kinney said the idea of ''Wimpy Kid'' came from "I wanted to write a story about the funny parts of growing up, and none of the serious parts. I had a pretty ordinary childhood, but lots of humorus stuff happened along the way. So, I decided to write a book about what it was really like to be a kid, or at least what it was like for me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpykid.com/ |title=Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney ::: Author Interview |publisher=Wimpykid.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>
