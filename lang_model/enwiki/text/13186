'''Bloody Friday''' is the name given to the bombings by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional Irish Republican Army's]] (IRA) [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]] in and around [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] on [[July 21]], [[1972]], which killed nine people including two soldiers, and injured 130 civilians.<ref name="CAIN">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bfriday/nio/nio72.htm CAIN]</ref>

The bombings were part of a concerted bombing campaign carried out by the IRA against economic, military and political targets in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="em">{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | date = 2002 | pages = p. 100 | doi =  | isbn = 0-141-01041-X}}</ref> The group carried out a total of 1,300 bombings in 1972. Following the failure of secret talks in London between the British government and the IRA in 1972, [[Gerry Adams]] played a central role in planning the Bloody Friday bomb blitz.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lalor | first=Brian (ed) | year=2003 |title=The Encyclopaedia of Ireland | publisher=Gill & Macmillan | location=Dublin, Ireland | isbn=0-7171-3000-2 | pages=p 7}}</ref>

==Overview==
A total of 22 bombs were planted and, in the resulting explosions, nine people were killed and a further 130 civilians injured.<ref name="CAIN"/> Warnings were given by the IRA via the local media to the security forces before the bombs exploded with 30 minutes' warning given for the first bombing and around 70 minutes' warning for the last bomb. The IRA leader, [[Sean MacStiofain]], claimed that the warnings for the two bombs which claimed lives were deliberately disregarded by the British for strategic policy reasons.<ref name="sm">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2132219.stm Bloody Friday: What happened]</ref> Along with some<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/conflict/violence.html The IRA Campaign of Violence] PBS.org</ref> accurate warnings which were given by the IRA, two more hoax warnings were called in, which impeded the evacuation of the area. As a result, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and [[British Army]] only effectively cleared a relatively small number of areas before the bombs went off. In addition, because of the large number of bombs in the confined area of Belfast city centre, people evacuated from the site of one bomb were accidentally moved into the vicinity of other bombs.

Thirty years after the killings the IRA issued a statement of apology.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2132188.stm Q&A: The IRA's apology]</ref>

==Sequence of events - 21 July 1972==
The accounts of the events that appeared in the first editions of local and national newspapers were, naturally enough, somewhat confused about the details of the events of the day. The timetable compiled by [[CAIN]] below is approximate and given in [[British Summer Time|BST/IST]] (UTC+1). The details are based on a number of secondary reports and accounts.<ref name="CAIN"/>

==Reactions and consequences==
Speaking in the Commons on 24th July, Home Secretary of the time [[William Whitelaw]] called the bombings "appallingly bloodthirsty". He also drew attention to the Catholic victims, and mentioned the revulsion in the Republic of Ireland as elsewhere. Leader of the Opposition [[Harold Wilson]] described the events as "a shocking crime against an already innocent population". The ''[[Irish Times]]'' wrote "The chief injury is not to the British Army, to the Establishment or to big business but to the plain people of Belfast and Ireland. Anyone who supports violence from any side after yesterday's events is sick with the same affliction as those who did the deed." Television images of firefighters shovelling body parts into plastic bags at the Oxford Street bus station were the most shocking of the day.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmdfence/57/3070205.htm Select Committee on Defence, 2 July 2003]</ref><ref>[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/cry-for-reconciliation--which-should-be-welcomed--by-all-299816.html ''Irish Independent'']</ref>

479 people died in the Troubles in 1972, more than in any other year of the conflict. Ten days after the bombings the British Army launched [[Operation Motorman]], to retake IRA controlled republican areas in Belfast and Derry. There were several revenge attacks by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]]. Bloody Friday itself was seen by some as a reprisal attack for [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in Derry six months earlier.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571415_8/Northern_Ireland.html Encarta]</ref>
