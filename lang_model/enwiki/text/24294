'''''The Rite of Spring''''', French title '''''Le Sacre du Printemps''''' ({{lang-ru|link=no| '''<U+0412><U+0435><U+0441><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0432><U+044F><U+0449><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F>''', ''Vesna svyashchennaya''}}) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] company, with choreography by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and stage designs and costumes by [[Nikolai Roerich]]. When the ballet was first performed, at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]] on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot in the audience. Nevertheless, Stravinsky's music achieved rapid success as a concert piece, and became recognised as one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century. It is very widely performed in the concert hall, and is frequently revived on the stage.

Stravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. ''The Rite'' was the third such project, after the acclaimed ''[[The Firebird]]'' and ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''. The concept behind ''The Rite'', developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, "Pictures of Pagan Russia"; in the scenario, after various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was unperformed until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by [[Leonide Massine]] replaced Nijinsky's original.
Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading ballet-masters, which gained the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in Los Angeles.

Stravinsky's score contains many features that were novel for its time, including experiments in [[tonality]], [[meter (music)|metre]], rhythm, [[Accent (music)|stress]] and [[Dissonance (music)|dissonance]]. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship which Stravinsky tended to deny. The music has influenced many of the 20th century's leading composers, and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.

== Background ==
[[File:Igor Stravinsky as drawn by Pablo Picasso 31 Dec 1920_-_Gallica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stravinsky, sketched by [[Pablo Picaso|Picasso]]]]
[[Igor Stravinsky]] was the son of [[Fyodor Stravinsky]], the principal [[bass (voice type)|bass]] at the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Imperial Opera]], [[St Petersburg]], and Anna, n<U+00E9>e Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, <U+00A7>1: Background and early years, 1882<U+2013>1905|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg1#S52818.1|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg University]], while taking private lessons in harmony and [[counterpoint]]. Having impressed Rimsky-Korsakov with some of his early compositional efforts, Stravinsky worked under the guidance of the older composer. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908 Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a [[Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor (Stravinsky)|Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor]] (1903<U+2013>04), a [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E-flat major]] (1907), which he catalogued as "Opus 1", and in 1908 a short orchestral piece, ''[[Feu d'artifice]]'' ("Fireworks").<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, <U+00A7>2: Towards ''The Firebird'', 1902<U+2013>09 | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg2#S52818.2|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Stravinsky, Igor, <U+00A7>11: Posthumous reputation and legacy: Works | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article_works/grove/music/52818pg11#S52818.12|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref>

In 1909 ''Feu d'artifice'' was performed at a concert in St Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]], who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences.<ref name= Hartog52>White 1961, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world.<ref>{{cite web|title= Diaghilev, Serge|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e2929?q=Diaghilev&search=quick&pos=3&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= The Oxford Dictionary of Music Online edition|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]''. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the [[Ballets Russes]], initially with Borodin's [[Polovtsian Dances]] from ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.  To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer [[Michel Fokine]], the designer [[L<U+00E9>on Bakst]] and the dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]].  Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent.<ref>{{cite web|last= Griffiths|first= Paul|title= Diaghilev (Dyagilev), Sergey Pavlovich|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08450?q=Diaghilev&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> Having heard ''Feu d'artifice'' he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by [[Frederick Chopin|Chopin]] to create the ballet ''[[Les Sylphides]]''. Stravinsky worked on the opening "Nocturne" and the closing "Valse Brillante"; his reward was a much bigger commission, to write the music for a new ballet, ''[[L'oiseau de feu|L'Oiseau du Feu]]'' (''The Firebird'') for the 1910 season.<ref name= Hartog52/>

Stravinsky worked through the winter of 1909<U+2013>10, in close association with Fokine who was choreographing ''The Firebird''. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, "the very essence of a great personality".<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 24<U+2013>28</ref> ''The Firebird'' was premiered on 25 June 1910, with [[Tamara Karsavina]] in the main role, and was a great public success.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, <U+00A7>3: The early Diaghilev ballets, 1910<U+2013>14|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg3#S52818.3|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> This ensured that the Diaghilev<U+2013>Stravinsky collaboration would continue, in the first instance with ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and then ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref name= Hartog52/>

== Synopsis and structure ==
Stravinsky has described ''The Rite of Spring'' as "a musical-choreographic work, [representing] pagan Russia&nbsp;... unified by a single idea: the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring". The work has no specific plot or narrative, but should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes.<ref name= VdT26>Van den Toorn, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>

The French titles of parts and movements are given in the form established in 1913. There have been numerous variants of the English translations; those shown are from the 1967 edition of the score.<ref name= VdT26/>

== Creation ==
=== Conception ===
[[File:Bakst daighilev.jpg|thumb|upright|Sergei Diaghilev, director of the ''Ballets Russes'' from 1909 to 1929, as painted by L<U+00E9>on Bakst]]
Stravinsky gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of ''The Rite''. In a 1920 article he had stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round.<ref>Hill, p. 3</ref> However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: "One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of ''L'Oiseau de Feu'' in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision&nbsp;... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".<ref>Stravinsky, p. 31</ref>

In any event, by May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing the idea with [[Nikolai Roerich]], the foremost Russian expert on folk art and old rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the ''Polovtsian Dances''.<ref name= H4/> The pair quickly agreed on a working title, "The Great Sacrifice" (Russian: ''Velikaia zhertva'');<ref name= VdT2>Van den Toorn, p. 2</ref>  Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''.<ref name= H4>Hill, pp. 4<U+2013>8</ref>

In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near [[Smolensk]], where Roerich was staying with the [[Princess Maria Tenisheva]], a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]]''. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>  Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the ''Rite'' premiere, suggests that the two-part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich.<ref>Kelly, p. 297</ref> Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the ''Russian Musical Gazette'', that the first part of the work would be called "The Kiss of the Earth", and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of [[Wise old man|sages]], culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, "The Sacrifice", would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages.<ref name= H4/>  The original working title was changed to "Holy Spring" (Russian: '' Vesna sviashchennaia''), but the work became generally known by the French rendering ''Le Sacre du Printemps'' or its English equivalent ''The Rite of Spring'', with the subtitle "Pictures of Pagan Russia".<ref name= VdT2/><ref>Grout, p. 712</ref>

=== Composition ===
[[File:RoyLindmanClarensSwitzerland 005.jpg|thumb|left|Clarens, in Switzerland (modern photograph), where most of ''The Rite of Spring'' was composed]]
Stravinsky's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at [[Ustyluh|Ustilug]] in the Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the "Augurs of Spring" and the "Spring Rounds".<ref name= VdT24>Van den Toorn, p. 24</ref> In October he left Ustilug for [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]] in Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room<U+2013>eight feet square, with only a piano, a table and two chairs<U+2014>he worked throughout the 1911<U+2013>12 winter on the score.<ref name= H13>Hill, p. 13</ref> By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II.<ref name= VdT24/> He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost,<ref name= H13/> which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes conductor [[Pierre Monteux]] in April 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 35</ref> He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of ''The Rite''; he and the composer [[Claude Debussy]] played the first half of this together, in June 1912.<ref name= H13/>

Following Diaghilev's decision to delay the premiere until 1913, Stravinsky put '' The Rite'' aside during the summer of 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 34</ref> He enjoyed the Paris season, and accompanied Diaghilev to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to attend a performance of ''[[Parsifal]]''.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 37<U+2013>39</ref> Stravinsky resumed work on ''The Rite'' in the autumn; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912.<ref name= VdT24/> During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score, which he signed and dated as "completed in Clarens, March 8, 1913".  After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March, Monteux drew the composer's attention to several passages which were causing problems: inaudible horns, a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings, and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during [[fortissimo]] episodes.<ref>Van den Toorn, pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref> Stravinsky amended these passages, and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the "Sacrificial Dance". Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere; rather, Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more. According to Van den Toorn, "[n]o other work of Stravinsky's underwent such a series of post-premiere revisions".<ref name= VdT39>Van den Toorn, pp. 39<U+2013>42</ref>

Stravinsky acknowledged that the work's opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs,<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 502</ref> but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources;<ref name= VdT10>Van den Toorn, p. 10</ref> if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music, he said, it was due to "some unconscious 'folk' memory".<ref name= VdT12>Van den Toorn, p. 12</ref> However, the Stravinsky scholar Lawrence Morton has identified several more melodies in Part I as having their origins in the Lithuanian collection.<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 510</ref><ref name= Hvii>Hill, pp. vii<U+2013>viii</ref> More recently [[Richard Taruskin]] has discovered the transposition into the work of one of Rimsky-Korsakov's "One Hundred Russian National Songs".<ref name= VdT12/><ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 513</ref> Taruskin notes the paradox whereby ''The Rite'', generally acknowledged the most revolutionary of the composer's early works, is in fact rooted in the traditions of Russian music.<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 543</ref>

=== Realisation ===
[[File:Vaslav-nijinsky-in-le-pavillon-d-armide-1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Nijinsky, depicted by [[John Singer Sargent]] at about the time of his collaboration with Stravinsky]]
Taruskin has listed a number of sources that Roerich consulted when creating his designs. Among these are ''[[The Primary Chronicle]]'', a 12th-century compendium of early pagan customs, and [[Alexander Afanasyev]]'s study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory.<ref name= Vdt14>Van den Toorn, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> The Princess Tenisheva's collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration.<ref name= H4/> When the designs were complete, Stravinsky expressed delight and declared them "a real miracle".<ref name= Vdt14/>

Stravinsky's relationship with his other main collaborator, Nijinsky, was more complicated.  Diaghilev had decided that
Nijinsky's genius as a dancer would translate into the role of ballet-master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'apr<U+00E8>s-midi d'un faune]]'', ended in controversy and near-scandal because of an overtly sexual gesture introduced by Nijinsky.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 36</ref><ref>Kelly, p. 263</ref>  It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's "passionate zeal and complete self-effacement".<ref name= H109>Hill, p. 109</ref> However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: "...the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument".<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref>{{refn|group=n|Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska later insisted that her brother could play a number of instruments, including the [[balalaika]], the clarinet and the piano.<ref name= K273/>}} Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as "knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas".<ref>Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143</ref> Stephen Walsh, a leading Stravinsky analyst, has suggested that the belated disavowal of Nijinsky's choreography, together with the denial of folk music influences, was part of an attempt by the composer, then in exile, to downplay the music's Russian roots and influences.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Proms 2012: Programme note: Stravinsky&nbsp;<U+2013> The Rite of Spring|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2012/analysis/139|publisher= BBC|accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref>

Stravinsky's autobiographical account refers to many "painful incidents" between the ballet-master and the dancers during the rehearsal period.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 42</ref> By the beginning of 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that "unless you come here immediately&nbsp;... the Sacre will not take place". The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913 the dancers appeared to have mastered the work's difficulties. Hill records that even the Ballets Russes's sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the "originality and dynamism" of Nijinsky's choreography.<ref name= H28>Hill, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref>

The conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911, and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of ''Petrushka''. Monteux's first reaction to ''The Rite'', after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner. Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism, he never came to enjoy the work; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it. The role of the sacrificial victim was to have been danced by Nijinsky's sister, [[Bronislava Nijinska]]; when she became pregnant during rehearsals she was replaced by the then relatively unknown Maria Piltz.<ref name= K273>Kelly, pp. 273<U+2013>77</ref>

== Performance history and reception ==
=== Premiere ===
[[File:Russian Ballet in Paris_-_New York Times 1913-06-07.png|thumb|left|''The New York Times'' reports the sensational ''Rite'' premiere, nine days after the event]]
Paris's [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre des Champs-<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>es]] was a new structure, which had opened on 2 April 1913 with a programme celebrating the works of many of the leading composers of the day.  The theatre's manager, [[Gabriel Astruc]], was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs for the privilege.<ref name= K273/> The premiere of ''The Rite'' was scheduled for 29 May 1913, in a programme that also included ''Les Sylphides'', [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'' and Borodin's ''Polovtsian Dances''.<ref name= K284>Kelly, pp. 284<U+2013>85</ref>

A Paris ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [[Bohemianism|"Bohemian"]] group who, the poet-philosopher [[Jean Cocteau]] asserted, would "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes".<ref>Ross, p. 74</ref> Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere, in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests.  According to Stravinsky all went peacefully.<ref name= S46/> However, the critic of ''L'<U+00C9>cho de Paris'', Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he wondered how the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.<ref name= K282>Kelly, p. 282</ref>

The evening of 29 May began with ''Les Sylphides'', in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles.<ref name= K284/> ''The Rite'' followed; there is general agreement among eyewitnesses and commentators that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew into a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in "Augurs of Spring".  [[Marie Rambert]], who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage.<ref name= H28/> In his autobiographical account, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into "a terrific uproar" which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers.<ref name= S46>Stravinsky, pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref> The journalist and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement, and "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.<ref name= White177/>
[[File:RiteofSpringDancers.jpg|thumb|Dancers in Nikolai Roerich's original costumes; Stravinsky later described these dancers as "knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas". ]]

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions in the audience began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected, either by the police or by the management. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final "Sacrificial Dance" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.<ref name= K292>Kelly, pp. 292<U+2013>94</ref>

Among the more hostile press reviews was that of ''[[Le Figaro]]''{{'}}s critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work "a laborious and puerile barbarity" and added "We are sorry to see an artist such as M.

Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome.<ref>Stravinsky and Craft 1959, pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref> To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky's choreography had been "incomparable: with the exception of a few places, everything was as I wanted it".<ref name= H109/>

=== Initial run and first revivals ===

After the premiere there were five further performances of ''The Rite'' in Paris, the last on 13 June. Although these occasions were relatively peaceful, something of the mood of the first night remained; the composer [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], who attended on 30 May,<ref name= K292/> described the choreography as ridiculous and the music cacophonous<U+2014>"the work of a madman. The public hissed, laughed&nbsp;<U+2013> and applauded".<ref>Adami (ed.), p. 251</ref> Stravinsky, confined to his bed by typhoid fever,<ref>Stravinsky, p. 49</ref> did not join the company when it went to London for four performances at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Diaghilev London Walk|url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/diaghilev-london-walk/|publisher= Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate= 27 August 2012}}</ref> Reviewing the London production, ''[[The Times]]'' critic was impressed how different elements of the work came together to form a coherent whole, but was less enthusiastic about the music itself, opining that Stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm: "If M. Stravinsky had wished to be really primitive, he would have been wise to&nbsp;... score his ballet for nothing but drums".<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Fusion of Music and Dancing|journal= The Times|date= 26 July 1913|page= p. 8}}</ref> The ballet historian Cyril Beaumont commented on the "slow, uncouth movements" of the dancers, finding these "in complete opposition to the traditions of classical ballet".<ref name= White177>White 1966, pp. 177<U+2013>78</ref> After the Paris and London performances Nijinsky's choreography, which Kelly describes as "so striking, so outrageous, so frail as to its preservation", was abandoned. It did not reappear in any performance of ''The Rite'' until attempts were made to reconstruct it in the 1980s.<ref name= K292/>

On 18 February 1914 ''The Rite'' received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under [[Serge Koussevitzky]].<ref>Hill, p. 8</ref> On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of ''The Rite'' as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers.<ref name= Vdt6>Van den Toorn, p. 6</ref>

Stravinsky spent most of the [[First World War]] years in Switzerland, and became a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]. When the war ended he resumed his partnership with Diaghilev, who in December 1920 revived ''The Rite''.  [[Ernest Ansermet]] conducted a new production choreographed by [[L<U+00E9>onide Massine]], with the Roerich designs retained; the lead dancer was [[Lydia Sokolova]].<ref name= White177/> In his memoirs, Stravinsky is equivocal about the Massine production; the young ballet-master, he writes, showed "unquestionable talent", but there was something "forced and artificial" in his choreography, which lacked the necessary organic relationship with the music.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref> Soklova, in her later account, recalled some of the tensions surrounding the production, with Stravinsky, "wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred Chosen Virgins, pranc[ing] up and down the centre aisle" while Ansermet rehearsed the orchestra.<ref name= H86>Hill, pp. 86<U+2013>89</ref> ''The Rite'' had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the [[Queens Hall]] in London under [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]]. Its American premiere was delayed until 3 March 1922, when [[Leopold Stokowski]] included it in a [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] programme.<ref>Smith, p. 94</ref>{{-}}

=== Later performances ===
==== Concert piece ====
Commentators have broadly agreed that, following enthusiastic receptions of concert performances in Moscow, Paris, London and Philadelphia, the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than on the stage. Many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music have been with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind.<ref>{{cite web|last= Freed|first= Richard|title= The Rite of Spring: About the work|url= http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2841|publisher= The Kennedy Centre|date= 20 November 2004|accessdate= 12 August 2012}}</ref> Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam;<ref name= VdT39/><ref>Stravinsky, p. 129</ref> two years later he brought it to the [[Salle Pleyel]] in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras&nbsp;... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it".<ref>Stravinsky, p. 137</ref> The work has since become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by [[Leonard Bernstein]] as "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".<ref name= Bernstein>{{cite web|title= The Rite of Spring at 100; The History|url= https://www.theriteofspringat100.org/the-history/|publisher= Carolina Performing Arts: The University of North Carolina|accessdate= 12 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].  According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of ''The Rite'' was ending;{{refn|group=n|In a different account of the incident, the music historian Richard Morrison writes that Stravinsky arrived at the end of the first part, rather than at the end of the piece.<ref>Johnson, pp. 137<U+2013>38</ref>}} composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience.<ref>Hill, p. 102</ref> Monteux's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by the end of the evening Stravinsky had asserted that "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened ''Rite'' or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity".<ref>Canarina, p. 301</ref>

==== Ballet ====
The ballet was first shown in the United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine's 1920 version was performed under Stokowski, with [[Martha Graham]] dancing the role of the Chosen One.<ref name= Juillard>{{cite web|last= Berman|first= Greta|title= Painting in the Key of Color: The Art of Nicholas Roerich|url= http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/2007-2008/0805/articles/0805_Art.php|work= the Julliard Journal Online|publisher= The Julliard School|date= May 2008|accessdate= !8 August 2012}}</ref> The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously.<ref name= J233>Johnson, pp. 233<U+2013>34</ref> The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the [[Modern Dance]] exponent [[Lester Horton]], whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a [[American Frontier|Wild West]] background and the use of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] dances.<ref name= J233/>

''The Rite'' reached Australia in 1946, when Goossens conducted a performance of the ballet in Sydney.<ref>{{cite web|title= Australian Composition 1945<U+2013>1959|url= http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/guides/1945-1959|publisher= Australian Music Centre|accessdate= 18 August 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, in 1944 Massine began a new collaboration with Roerich, who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which Massine brought to fruition at [[La Scala]], Milan in 1948.<ref name= Juillard/>  This heralded a number of significant postwar European productions. [[Mary Wigman]] in Berlin (1957) followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice, as did [[Maurice B<U+00E9>jart]] in Brussels (1959). B<U+00E9>jart' s representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as "ceremonial coitus".<ref name= J233/> The [[Royal Ballet]]'s 1962 production, choreographed by [[Kenneth MacMillan]] and designed by [[Sidney Nolan]], was first performed on 3 May and was a critical triumph. It has remained in the company's repertoire for more than 50 years; after its revival in May 2011 the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}} critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet's greatest achievements.<ref>{{cite web|last= Monahan|first= Mark| title= Covent Garden and Salisbury Playhouse, review|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/dance/8546035/Covent-Garden-and-Salisbury-Playhouse-review.html|publisher= The Telegraph online|date= 30 May 2011|accessdate= 18 August 2011}}</ref> Moscow first saw ''The Rite'' in 1965, in a version choreographed for the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] by [[Natalia Kasatkina]] and [[Vladimir Vasiliev (dancer)|Vladimir Vasiliev]].

On 30 September 1987, the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in Los Angeles performed ''The Rite'' based on a reconstruction of Nijinsky's 1913 choreography, until then thought lost beyond recall.

== Music ==
=== General character and instrumentation ===
[[File:PianoReductionRiteofSpring1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cover of the 1913 four-hand piano reduction of ''The Rite of Spring'', the first published version of the work]]
Commentators have often described ''The Rite''{{'}}s music in vivid terms; Paul Rosenfeld, in 1920, wrote of it "pound[ing] with the rhythm of engines, whirls and spirals like screws and fly-wheels, grinds and shrieks like laboring metal".<ref>Rosenfeld, p. 202</ref> In a more recent analysis, ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Donal Henahan]] refers to "great crunching, snarling chords from the brass and thundering thumps from the timpani".<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Donal Henahan|last= Henahan|first= Donal|title= Philharmonic: Incarnations of Spring|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/23/arts/philharmonic-incarnations-of-spring.html|journal= The New York Times|date= 23 March 1984}}</ref> The composer [[Julius Harrison]] acknowledged the uniqueness of the work negatively: it demonstrated Stravinsky's "abhorrence of everything for which music has stood these many centuries&nbsp;... all human endeavour and progress are being swept aside to make room for hideous sounds..."<ref>Harrison, p. 168</ref>

In ''The Firebird'', Stravinsky had begun to experiment with [[Polytonality|bitonality]] (the use of two different keys simultaneously). He took this technique further in ''Petrushka'', but reserved its full effect for ''The Rite'' where, as the analyst E.W. White explains, he "pushed [it] to its logical conclusion".<ref>White 1961, p. 59</ref> White also observes the music's complex metrical character, with combinations of [[Duple meter|duple]] and [[Triple meter|triple]] time in which a strong irregular beat is emphasised by powerful percussion.<ref>White 1961, p. 61</ref> The music critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] has described the irregular process whereby Stravinsky adapted and absorbed traditional Russian folk material into the score. He "proceeded to pulverize them into motivic bits, pile them up in layers, and reassemble them in cubistic collages and montages".<ref>Ross, p. 90</ref>

The duration of the work is about 35 minutes. The score calls for an orchestra of two [[piccolo]]s, three [[flute]]s, one flute in [[G major]], four [[oboe]]s, two [[Cor anglais|English horns]], two [[B-flat major|B-flat]] [[clarinet]]s, piccolo clarinet in [[E<U+266D> (musical note)|E-flat]], two [[bass clarinet]]s, four [[bassoon]]s, two [[contrabassoon]]s, eight [[French horn|horns]], four [[trumpet]]s, small trumpet in [[D major]], bass trumpet, three [[trombone]]s, two tenor [[tuba]]s, two bass tubas, a percussion section with [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbals]], antique cymbals, [[gong]], [[Triangle (instrument)|triangle]], guiro, and a large strings complement.<ref>{{cite web|last= Freed|first= Richard|title= The Rite of Spring: About the Work|url= http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2841|publisher= The Kennedy Centre|date= November 2004|accessdate= 27 July 2012}}</ref> The strings consist of eight first violins, seven second violins, six violas, seven cellos and six double-basses. Despite the large orchestra, much of the score is written chamber-fashion, with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles.<ref>Kelly, p. 280</ref>

=== Part I: The Adoration of the Earth ===
The opening melody is played by a solo bassoon in a very high register, which renders the instrument almost unidentifiable;<ref>Kelly, p. 259</ref> gradually other woodwind instruments are sounded and are eventually joined by strings.<ref name= Berger/>  The sound builds up before stopping suddenly, Hill says, "just as it is bursting ecstatically into bloom". There is then a reiteration of the opening bassoon solo, now played a semitone lower.<ref name= Hill62>Hill, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref>

The first dance, "Augurs of Spring", is characterised by a repetitive stamping chord in the horns and strings, based on E-flat superimposed on an E-major [[Triad (music)|triad]].<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 138</ref> White suggests that this bitonal combination, which Stravinsky considered the focal point of the entire work, was devised on the piano, since the constituent chords are comfortable fits for the hands on a keyboard.<ref>White 1961, p. 57</ref> The rhythm of the stamping is disturbed by Stravinsky's constant shifting of the [[Accent (music)|accent]], on and off the beat,<ref>Ross, p. 75</ref> before the dance ends in a collapse, as if from exhaustion.<ref name= Berger/> The "Ritual of Abduction" which follows is described by Hill as "the most terrifying of musical hunts". It concludes in a series of flute trills that usher in the "Spring Rounds", in which a slow and laborious theme gradually rises to a dissonant [[fortissimo]], a "ghastly caricature" of the episode's main tune.<ref name= Berger>{{cite video

Brass and percussion predominate as the "Ritual of the Rival Tribes" begins. A tune emerges on tenor and bass tubas, leading after much repetition to the entry of the Sage's procession.<ref name= Berger/> The music then comes to a virtual halt, "bleached free of colour" (Hill),<ref>Hill, p. 70</ref> as the Sage blesses the earth. The "Dance of the Earth" then begins, bringing Part I to a close in a series of phrases of the utmost vigour which are abruptly terminated in what Hill describes as a "blunt, brutal amputation".<ref name= H72>Hill, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref>

=== Part II: The Sacrifice ===
[[File:Sacrificialdance.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketches of Maria Piltz performing the sacrificial dance]]
Part II has a greater cohesion than its predecessor; according to Hill, the music follows an arc stretching from the beginning of the Introduction to the conclusion of the final dance.<ref name= H72/> Woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout the Introduction, which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes. The transition into the "Mystic Circles" is almost imperceptible; the main theme of the section has been prefigured in the Introduction. A loud repeated chord, which Berger likens to a call to order, announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim.  The "Glorification of the Chosen One" is brief and violent; in the "Evocation of the Ancestors" that follows, short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls. The "Ritual Action of the Ancestors" begins quietly, but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into the quiet phrases that began the episode.<ref name= Berger/>

The final transition introduces the "Sacrificial Dance". This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I, though it contains some wild moments, with the large percussion section of the orchestra given full voice. Stravinsky had difficulties with this section, especially with the final bars that conclude the work. The abrupt ending displeased several critics, one of whom wrote that the music "suddenly falls over on its side". Stravinsky himself referred to the final chord disparagingly as "a noise", but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite the section, was unable to produce a more acceptable solution.<ref name= H86/>

== Influence and adaptations ==
In his ''History of Western Music'', [[Donald Jay Grout]] writes: "''The Sacre'' is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century&nbsp;... it had the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before".<ref>Grout, p. 713</ref> The academic and critic Jan Smaczny, echoing Bernstein, calls it one of the 20th century's most influential compositions, providing "endless stimulation for performers and listeners".<ref name= Bernstein/><ref name= Smac>{{cite video

Among 20th century composers most influenced by ''The Rite'' is Stravinsky's near contemporary, [[Edgard Var<U+00E8>se]], who had attended the 1913 premiere. Var<U+00E8>se, according to Ross, was particularly drawn to the "cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms" of ''The Rite'', which he employed to full effect in his concert work ''[[Am<U+00E9>riques]]'' (1921), scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion's roar and a wailing siren.<ref>Ross, p. 137</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= May|first= Thomas|title= Var<U+00E8>se: Am<U+00E9>riques|url= http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/ameriques-edgard-varese|publisher= The Los Angeles Philharmonic|accessdate= 19 August 2012}}</ref> [[Aaron Copland]], to whom Stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former's student days, considered ''The Rite'' a masterpiece that had created "the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord".<ref>{{cite video

After the premiere the writer Leon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 years ahead of its time, suitable to be heard in 1940. Coincidentally, it was in that year that [[Walt Disney]] released ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'', an animated feature film based on music from ''The Rite'' and other classical compositions.<ref name= K258/> The ''Rite'' segment of the film depicted the Earth's prehistory, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Among those impressed by the film was [[Gunther Schuller]], later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The ''Rite of Spring'' sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: "I hope [Stravinsky] appreciated that hundreds<U+2014>perhaps thousands<U+2014>of musicians were turned onto ''The Rite of Spring''&nbsp;... through ''Fantasia,'' musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Teachout|first= Terry|title= Why 'Fantasia' Mattered<U+2014>Just Ask Gunther Schuller|url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204644504576653263235079674.html?mod=googlenews_wsj%3Cbr%20/%3E|journal= Wall Street Journal|date= 28 October 2011}}</ref> In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer [[Paul Hindemith]] observed that "Igor appears to love it".<ref>Ross, pp. 297<U+2013>98</ref>

== Recordings ==
{{main|The Rite of Spring discography}}
Before the first gramophone disc recordings of ''The Rite'' were issued in 1929, Stravinsky had helped to produce a [[pianola]] version of the work for the [[Aeolian Company]]. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French [[player piano]] company [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]], with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium.<ref>White 1979, pp. 619<U+2013>20</ref> The Pleyel version of ''The Rite of Spring'' was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990<ref name= H162>Hill, pp. 162<U+2013>64</ref>

In 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first gramophone recording of ''The Rite''. While Stravinsky led L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski's version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960.<ref name= H162/><ref>Hill, pp. 118<U+2013>19</ref> According to the critic [[Edward Greenfield]], Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]] the composer inspired a performance with "extraordinary thrust and resilience".<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Edward Greenfield|last= Greenfield|first= Edward|title= Distinctive movements in the rites of rivals|journal= The Guardian|date= 20 May 1988|pages= p. 34}}</ref> In conversations with [[Robert Craft]], Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of ''The Rite'' made in the 1960s. Of [[Herbert von Karajan]]'s 1963 recording with the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]], Stravinsky commented: "The recording is generally good, the performance is&nbsp;... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one". [[Pierre Boulez]], with the [[Orchestre National de France]] (1963), was "less good than I had hoped&nbsp;... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations". A recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra in 1962 was complimented on making the music sound Russian "which is just right", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement is that none of these three performances is worth preserving.<ref>Stravinsky and Craft 1982, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>

As of 2012 there are well over 100 different recordings of ''The Rite'' commercially available, and many more held in library sound archives. It has became one of the most recorded of all 20th century musical works.<ref name= H162/><ref>{{cite web|title= Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps)|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/53903/Igor-Feodorovich-Stravinsky-The-Rite-of-Spring|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 27 August 2012}}</ref>

== Editions ==

The 1913 autograph score, used in the premiere and other early performances, has never been published.{{refn|group=n|After being kept in Russia for decades, the autograph score was acquired by Boosey and Hawkes in 1947. The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962, on his 80th birthday. After the composer's death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the [[Paul Sacher|Paul Sacher Foundation]].<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 36 (note 30)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.paul-sacher-stiftung.ch/en/collections/p_t/igor_strawinsky.html|title= Collections: Igor Strawinsky|publisher= Paul Sacher Foundation|accessdate= 29 August 2012}}</ref>}} The first published score was the four-hand piano arrangement (Edition Russe de Musique, RV196), dated 1913. Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).<ref name= VdT39/><ref name= Craft/>

In 1922 Ansermet, who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin, sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score.<ref name= Craft/> In 1926, as part of his preparation for that year's performance with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], Stravinsky rewrote the "Evocation of the Ancestors" section and made substantial changes to the "Sacrificial Dance". The extent of these revisions, together with Ansermet's recommendations, convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary, and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929. It did not, however, incorporate all of Ansermet's amendments and, confusingly, bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition, making the new edition hard to identify.<ref name= VdT39/>

Stravinsky continued to revise the work, and in 1943 rewrote the "Sacrificial Dance". In 1948 [[Boosey and Hawkes]] issued a corrected version of the 1929 score (B&H 16333); Stravinsky's 1943 amendment of the "Sacrificial Dance" was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed, to the composer's disappointment. He considered it "much easier to play&nbsp;... and superior in balance and sonority" to the earlier versions.<ref name= Craft>{{cite journal|authorlink= Robert Craft|last= Craft|first= Robert|title= Le Sacre du Printemps: The Revisions|journal= Tempo|volume= New Series|issue= 122|date= September 1977|jstor= 945096}} {{subscription}}</ref>

The 1929 score forms the basis of most performances of ''The Rite''. Boosey and Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B&H 19441) in 1967. The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 (B&H 17271) and a revised piano version, incorporating the 1929 revisions, in 1967.<ref name= VdT39/>
