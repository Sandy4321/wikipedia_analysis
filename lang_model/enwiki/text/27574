'''SS ''Tubantia''''' was an [[ocean liner]] for [[Royal Holland Lloyd]] ({{lang-nl|Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd}}) built in 1913 by [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] of [[Glasgow]]. She was built as a fast mail and passenger steamer for service between the Netherlands and South America. ''Tubantia'' was a [[sister ship]] of {{SS|Gelria||2}}, also of Royal Holland Lloyd.

''Tubantia'' was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine {{SMU|UB-13||2}} on 16 March 1916. As a vessel of the neutral [[Netherlands]], her sinking caused great fury amongst the Dutch public. The Germans initially claimed that ''Tubantia'' must have been sunk by a [[mine (naval)|mine]] or a British torpedo, but when fragments of a German torpedo were found in one of ''Tubantia''{{'}}s [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], the Germans claimed that ''UB-13'' had fired the torpedo on 6 March at a British warship but it had remained active until hitting ''Tubantia'' ten days later. To redirect Dutch anger over ''Tubantia''{{'}}s sinking, Germany spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands, which one author called a "propaganda coup".<ref name=van-160 />

Germany initially offered a settlement of <U+00A3>300,000<U+2014>the ship's original cost<U+2014>to Royal Holland Lloyd, but was rejected. In 1922, an international arbitration committee awarded the company <U+00A3>830,000 compensation from Germany for the loss of the ship.

This was followed by an attempt to recover a fortune in gold coins from the wreck, which was the subject of a landmark court case, but the salvage operation was unsuccessful.

== Design and construction ==
''Tubantia'' was ordered by [[Royal Holland Lloyd]] from the Scottish shipbuilding firm [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] of [[Glasgow]]. The {{GRT|13911|first=short}} ship was about {{convert|560|ft|m}} long ([[length overall|overall]]) and {{convert|66|ft|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. She was powered by twin [[quadruple-expansion steam engine]]s powered by three double-ended and six single-ended [[boiler]]s. Her top speed of {{convert|17.5|knots|km/h}} exceeded the design requirements.<ref name=CSM-1914-04 />

Built at a cost of about <U+00A3>300,000, ''Tubantia'' was, according to author Nigel Pickford, one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era.<ref name=Pick-213>Pickford, p. 213.</ref> Royal Holland Lloyd made extensive use of electricity throughout ''Tubantia'', powering everything from fans and ventilation, to laundry equipment, to cigar lighters for passengers. The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights, suspended between the two [[steamship funnel|funnels]].<ref name=Pick-213 /> ''Tubantia'' could accommodate up to 1,520 passengers: 250 [[first class travel|first-class]], 230 intermediate-class, 140 special third-class, and 900 third-class passengers.<ref name=CSM-1914-04 /> The liner was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 13 November 1913,<ref name=Miramar /> and completed trials in the [[River Clyde]] in March 1914.<ref name=CSM-1914-04 />

== Career ==
Upon completion and acceptance by Royal Holland Lloyd, ''Tubantia'' was used in service between [[Amsterdam]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Tubantia'' was returning from South America with <U+00A3>500,000 in gold destined for banks in London, a large portion of which was intended for the German Bank of London.<ref name=british_capture>{{cite news | title = British capture $2,500,000 prize | work = The Washington Post | date = 8 August 1914 | page = 1 }}</ref> She was also carrying about 150 German reservists in [[steerage]] and a cargo of grain destined for Germany.<!-- grain --><ref name=british_capture /><ref name=3600_refugees>{{cite news | title = 3,600 refugees home on 2 ships | work = The New York Times | date = 18 August 1914 | page = 5 }}</ref><!-- number of reservists --> After making an intermediate stop in [[Vigo]], [[Spain]], ''Tubantia'' was stopped and boarded by an officer and crewmen from the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser {{HMS|Highflyer|1898|2}},<ref name=3600_refugees /> and escorted into port at [[Plymouth]].<ref name=british_capture /> There, the German reservists were taken off ''Tubantia'' by [[Royal Marines]];<ref name=3600_refugees /> the gold was confiscated and removed from the ship.<ref name=south_american>{{cite news | title = South American gold arrives in England | work = The Wall Street Journal | date = 8 August 1914 | page = 4 }}</ref> Although news accounts do not report when it occurred, ''Tubantia'' was released from Plymouth and allowed to resume her Royal Holland Lloyd service.

On 18 October, ''[[The New York Times]]'' carried a report that indicated ''Tubantia''  had run aground on the coast of [[Kent]] the previous day. According to the report, ''Tubantia'' was returning from [[Buenos Aires]] and suffered the accident while heading for [[Rotterdam]] with a large number of passengers. Although the article also reported that aid had been summoned from [[Dover]], there was no indication of the extent of damage, if any, to ''Tubantia''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Dutch steamer ashore | work = The New York Times | date = 18 October 1914 | page = 4 }}</ref>

In December 1915, ''Tubantia'' again made news when the [[Overseas News Agency]] in [[Berlin]] released a report saying that the British had seized all South America mail and parcels from the ship.<ref>{{cite news | title = British seize more mail | work = The New York Times | date = 29 December 1915 | page = 3 }}</ref> After the United States expressed concerns about related seizures from two other Dutch ships in service to the United States<U+2014>{{SS|Nieuw Amsterdam|1905|2}} and {{SS|Rijndam||2}}<U+2014>the British [[Foreign Office]] issued a statement that reported that [[contraband]] intended for Germany<U+2014>which included four packages of rubber, and seven containers of wool<U+2014>had been found among ''Tubantia''{{'}}s mail.<ref>{{cite news | title = British send note on mail detention | work = The New York Times | date = 27 January 1916 | page = 2 }}</ref>

== Sinking ==
''Tubantia'' began her regularly scheduled voyage from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Buenos Aires]] on 15 March 1916 nearly empty of passengers,<ref name=Pick-213 /> despite Royal Holland Lloyd advertisements that boasted of "submarine signalling apparatus" on their passenger ships.<ref name=tourist>Wood, [[endpaper|front endpaper]].</ref> After sailing to a position about {{convert|4|nmi|km}} from the North Hinder Lightship, about {{convert|50|nmi|km}} off the Dutch coast, ''Tubantia'' anchored at about 02:00 on 16 March to wait for daylight and avoid any chance of misidentification or attack. To that end, the ship was completely illuminated.<ref name=van-159>Van Tuyll van Serooskerken, p. 159.</ref>

At about 02:30, crewmen aboard ''Tubantia'' spotted a stream of bubbles rapidly approaching the ship's starboard side, followed by an explosion. The ship quickly began sinking.<ref name=van-159 /> Distress calls sent out by ''Tubantia'' were answered by three ships, ''Breda'', ''Krakstau'', and ''La Campine'', which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew.<ref name="Pick-214" /> The ship and her cargo were a total loss.<ref name=van-159 /> ''Tubantia'' was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war.<ref name=van-159 />

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Tubantia cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch artist Piet van der Hem's [[editorial cartoon]] decrying the sinking of ''Tubantia'']]
A war in the British and German press erupted, with each attempting to blame the other country for the egregious violation of Dutch neutrality.  The German press first proffered the explanation that ''Tubantia'' must have been sunk by a British [[mine (naval)|mine]]. The British reported that the liner had been sunk by a German torpedo; the German press countered by saying that if it were a torpedo that sank the ship, it had to have been a British one. The matter was seemingly settled when a stray lifeboat of ''Tubantia''{{'}}s was examined and torpedo fragments made of bronze were found embedded in it; Germany was the only country that used bronze in its torpedoes.<ref name="Pick-214" />

Presented with evidence that it was torpedo no. 2033 which had been assigned to the small, coastal submarine {{SMU|UB-13||2}},<ref group=Note>Sources almost invariably report the submarine as ''U-boat 13'' or ''U-13''. {{SMU|UB-13||2}} was the only extant U-boat numbered 13 in March 1916; {{SMU|U-13||2}}  and {{SMU|UC-13||2}} had been lost in 1914 and 1915, respectively. See: Helgason, Gu<U+00F0>mundur. [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=13 "WWI U-boats: U-13"], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=UB+13 "UB-13"], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=UC+13 "UC-13"]. ''U-Boat War in World War I''. Uboat.net. Retrieved on 16 March 2009.</ref> the Germans presented a forged log from ''UB-13'' that showed her nowhere near ''Tubantia'' at the time of the attack. Further, they reported, ''UB-13'' had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March, ten days before ''Tubantia'' was sunk.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = George Grafton | authorlink = George Grafton Wilson | journal = The American Journal of International Law | title = Report of the International Commission of Inquiry in the Loss of the Dutch Steamer Tubantia | volume = 16 | year = 1922 | page = 432 |issn = 0002-9300 | oclc = 1480149 | doi=10.2307/2188183}}</ref> The U.S. [[United States Ambassador to the Netherlands|Minister to the Netherlands]], [[Henry van Dyke]], writing in ''Fighting for Peace'' in 1917, called this explanation "amazing" and derided it:

{{quote|This certain U-boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war-vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the ''Tubantia'' was sunk. The shot missed its mark. But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to kill somebody. Then the ''Tubantia'' came along and the wandering-Willy torpedo promptly, obstinately, ran into the ship and sank her. This was the explanation. Germany was not to blame.<ref name=vanDyke-430>van Dyke, p. 430.</ref>}}

The Dutch public was furious at what they believed a hostile German act.  To help divert the public anger against his country, German diplomat [[Richard von K<U+00FC>hlmann]] began a coordinated campaign to spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands. Author Hubert van Tuyll van Serooskerken called the German plan a "propaganda coup", and reports in his book ''The Netherlands and World War I'' that the rumors caused some panic in the streets and forced the government to declare a four-day emergency from 30 March to 2 April.<ref name=van-160>van Tuyll van Serooskerken, p. 160.</ref>

Despite denials and rumor-spreading, Germany nevertheless offered compensation in the amount of <U+00A3>300,000, ''Tubantia''{{'}}s original cost. Rejected by the Dutch, the two countries agreed to have the issue arbitrated after the end of the war. The dispute was finally settled in 1922, when compensation in the amount of <U+00A3>830,000 was awarded to Royal Holland Lloyd.<ref name="Pick-214" />

===Salvage attempt===
In 1924 the wreck was the subject of a salvage dispute between two sets of salvors, both seeking to recover a reputed <U+00A3>2 million worth of gold coins from it (<U+00A3>100 million in 2012 prices). This was resolved in the English court decision ''The Tubantia'' [1924] P 78, and remains the leading authority under [[English law]] as to when a salvor takes possession of a sunken shipwreck. The winning party, war hero [[Sydney Vincent Sippe]], spent three years and <U+00A3>100,000 trying to access the gold, but abandoned the attempt after concluding that it was too dangerous for divers to recover it.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pickford | first = Nigel | title = Lost Treasure Ships of the Northern Seas: A Guide and Gazetteer to 2000 Years of Shipwreck | location = London | publisher = Chatham | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-86176-250-4 | oclc = 67375472 }}</ref>
