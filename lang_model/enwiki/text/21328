'''San Francisco Girls Chorus''' is a regional center for music education and performance for girls and young women, ages 7<U+2013>18, based in San Francisco. More than 300 singers from 160 schools in 48 [[San Francisco Bay Area]] cities and towns participate in this internationally recognized program. The Chorus has been described as "a model in the country for training girls' voices" by the [[California Arts Council]].

SFGC was founded by Elizabeth Appling, who served as the organization's Artistic Director until her retirement in 1992. She was succeeded by Sharon J. Paul, who led the chorus until just after its 21st Anniversary in 2000. The chorus underwent an interim year under the leadership of Magen Solomon, after which the helm was passed on to the current artistic director, Susan McMane.

==The Chorus School==
The Chorus School of SFGC comprises four training stages that are specifically designed to increase technical skills, stamina and discipline in accordance with the chorister's age and physical development. The Chorus School has been supervised since its inception by Elizabeth Avakian, who also directs Level IV.

*'''Level I''' provides the foundation for the singers' training in the Chorus School. Singers learn the basics of [[music theory]] and how to sing together as a group.

*'''Level II''' requires singers delve into slightly more challenging theory and music. Girls may begin to learn basic [[choreography]] to accompany some of their pieces. This chorus generally sings two-part music, occasionally three.

*'''Level III''' singers continue to learn music and theory at an increased difficulty. The concept of adjusting the voice for blending with the voices around it becomes more prominent. This chorus generally sings three-part music, occasionally four.

*'''Level IV''' In the final level of the Chorus School, singers continue their study of theory and generally sing in four parts, sometimes more. Level IV has a strenuous Christmas performance season and then go on to sing many more [[concerts]] than the previous three levels throughout the rest of the school year. Singers may also be selected from Level IV to appear in performances with the [[San Francisco Opera]] and [[San Francisco Symphony]]. In 2008 the girls were proud to sing in three operas: Boris Godunov, La Boheme, and Die Tote Stadt.

The Level IV Ensemble is a smaller, select group of girls within Level IV. Girls who wish to join must audition during the Chorus' Summer Music camp. The Ensemble has occasional extra practices, as well as many extra performances. They are asked to perform when the venues are too small to accommodate the entire Level IV.  Most of their performances are around Christmas and in the Spring. They memorize a few more songs, and sometimes extra verses to songs the rest of the chorus learns.

At the end of the season, Level IV choristers must pass a theory-based qualifying exam before being considered for [[graduation]] from the Chorus School. Once graduated, choristers may either choose to audition for Chorissima, return to level IV, or leave the Chorus.
