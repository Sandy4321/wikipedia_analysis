The '''[[2004 NFL season|2004]] [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[List of San Francisco 49ers seasons|season]]''' was the team's 59th season, and 55th season in the [[National Football League]].

The 49ers hoped to improve upon their disappointing 7-9 output from the [[2003 San Francisco 49ers season|previous season]]. However, the 49ers finished the season with the worst record in football, managing only two victories, both coming against division-rival [[2004 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] in overtime. The 49ers earned the #1 overall pick in the [[2005 NFL Draft]], where they selected quarterback [[Alex Smith (quarterback)|Alex Smith]], who would play for the team for several years.

Head coach [[Dennis Erickson]] was fired after the season.
