'''Lamington''' is a national park in Queensland, Australia, lying on the '''Lamington Plateau''' of the [[McPherson Range]] on the Queensland/New South Wales border. From [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] on the [[Gold Coast, Australia|Gold Coast]] the park is 85&nbsp;km to the southwest and [[Brisbane]] is 110&nbsp;km north.

Lamington National Park is known for its natural beauty, rainforests, birdlife, ancient trees, waterfalls, walking tracks and mountain views. The park is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia]] inscribed in 1986 and added to the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in 2007.

==Geography==
Part of the [[Scenic Rim]], most of the park is situated 900 m above sea level only 30&nbsp;km from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific's]] ocean shores. The plateaus and cliffs in Lamington and [[Springbrook National Park]]s are the northern and north western remnants of the huge 23 million year old [[Tweed Volcano]], centered around [[Mount Warning]]. Elevation in the south of the park is above 1000&nbsp;m in some parts.<ref name="naq">{{cite book |title=Natural areas of Queensland |last=Shilton |first=Peter |year=2005 |publisher=Goldpress |location=Mount Gravatt, Queensland |isbn=0-9758275-0-2 |pages=173-176 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>  The land declines to under 700 m in the north. Some of the mountains located in the park include Mount Hobwee, Mount Widgee, Mount Toolona, Mount Cominan, Mount Roberts and Mount Bithongabel. The [[Nerang River]], [[Albert River, Queensland|Albert River]] and [[Coomera River, Queensland|Coomera River]] all have their source in Lamington National Park.<ref name="seeing">{{Cite book|year=1980 |title=Seeing South-East Queensland |edition=2 |pages=53 |publisher=RACQ |isbn=0-909518-07-6}}</ref> Eastern parts of the park feature high cliffs which rise above the [[Numinbah Valley]].<ref name="naq"/>

==History==
[[Image:BinnaBurra5.JPG|thumb|right|View north to [[Beechmont, Queensland|Beechmont]] from [[Binna Burra]], 2005.]]
For at least 6000 years, [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] lived in and visited these mountains.<ref name="lackner">{{Cite book|last=Lackner |first=Thomas |year=1989 |title=Discovering Binna Burra on foot |publisher=Envirobook |isbn=0858810883 |pages=5<U+2013>13 }}</ref> The vanished Wangerriburras and Nerangballum tribes claimed home to the plateau territory.<ref name="seeing"/> Roughly 900 years ago the indigenous population began to decline. Bushrangers Cave, which is located close to Mount Hobwee and is 60&nbsp;m long, was once an aboriginal camp.<ref name="naq"/> This site shows Aboriginal occupation going back 10,000 years.<ref name="naq"/> 

Captain [[Patrick Logan]] and [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] were the first European explorers in the area.  The timber cutters soon followed, including the Lahey family who owned one of Queensland's largest [[timber mill]]s at the time.<ref name="discover">{{Cite book|title=Discover Australia's National Parks |last=Hema Maps |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] Australia |location=Milsons Point, New South Wales |isbn=1975992472 |pages=182<U+2013>183 }}</ref> In 1863 a survey of the Queensland/New South Wales border was conducted.  The task was carried out by Francis Edward Roberts and Isaiah Rowland, both surveyors, who had to define the border along the highest points in dense rainforest where there were very few clear [[Sightline|lines of sight]].<ref name="naq"/>
[[Image:BinnaBurra1.JPG|thumb|right|Exposed volcanic rocks, 2005.]]
Robert Martin Collins campaigned heavily for the protection of the area from logging from the 1890s.<ref name="discover" /> Collins entered [[Queensland Legislative Assembly|state parliament]] and saw a bill passed that preserved state forests and national parks but he died before the McPherson Range was protected.<ref name="xqnp">{{Cite book|title=Explore Queensland's National Parks |year=2008 |publisher=Explore Australia Publishing |location=Prahran, Victoria |isbn=9781741172454 |pages=30<U+2013>33 }}</ref> Later it was another local, Romeo Lahey who recognised the value of preserving the forests.  He campaigned to make it one of the first [[protected area]]s in Queensland.<ref name="heritage">{{Cite book|title=Heritage Trails of the Great South East |last=Queensland Environmental Protection Agency |year=2000 |publisher=State of Queensland |location= |isbn=0-7345-1008-X |pages=18 }}</ref> The O<U+2019>Reilly family established a guesthouse near the park in 1926, now named [[O'Reilly's Guesthouse|O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat]], and founding members of the National Parks Association of Queensland built [[Binna Burra]] Lodge next to the park in the 1930s. Lamington National park was established in 1915.<ref name="xqnp"/> The park was named after [[Alexander Baillie-Cochrane|Lord Lamington]], [[Governor of Queensland]] from 1896 to 1902.<ref name="seeing" /><ref name="xqnp"/>

In 1937, [[Bernard O'Reilly (author)|Bernard O'Reilly]] became a hero when he rescued the survivors from a crashed [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] plane from the remote Lamington wilderness.<ref name="xqnp"/> In typical Australian bushman fashion he embarked on his rescue mission taking only onions to eat.  Only a small portion of the original wreck remains today, 10&nbsp;km south from the O'Reilly's guesthouse.

==Natural heritage==
[[File:Nothofagus moorei in Lamington National Park Australia.jpg|thumb|Antarctic Beech trees only grows above 1000 metres, 2001.]]
Rugged mountain scenery, tumbling [[waterfall]]s, caves, [[rainforest]], wildflower [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, tall open forests, picturesque creeks, varied wildlife and some of the best [[bushwalking]] in Queensland are protected in Lamington National Park.  One of Queensland<U+2019>s best-loved parks, Lamington is the core of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves Australia World Heritage Area along the adjoining [[Border Ranges National Park]] in New South Wales.

[[David Attenborough]] visited and filmed the park while making the 1979 television series ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]'' in which beech trees and bowerbirds were featured.<ref name="time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/travel/article/0,31542,1913388,00.html |title=The Luck of O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat |author=Phil Brown |accessdate=5 August 2010 |date=29 July 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=Time Inc. }}</ref>

===Flora===
The national park protects one of the most diverse areas of vegetation in the country.<ref name="xqnp"/> The park<U+2019>s lush rainforests include one of the largest upland [[subtropical]] rainforest remnants in the world and the most northern [[Nothofagus moorei|Antarctic Beech]] cool [[temperate rainforest]]s in Australia.<ref name="asm"/> The roots of the oldest Antarctic beech trees are over 5,000 years old.<ref name="heritage" /><ref name="asm"/> Around Mount Widgee numbers of Antarctic beech appear to be increasing.<ref name="naq"/> The park protects one of the country's largest remaining forests of [[hoop pine]] which are found on the drier slopes.<ref name="xqnp"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/lamington/culture.html |title=Lamington National Park: Nature, culture and history |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=Department of Environment and Resource Management }}</ref>

Below 880&nbsp;m the [[White Booyong]] and [[Black Booyong]] are commonly found.<ref name="naq"/> In higher elevations the [[Yellow Carabeen]], [[Red Carabeen]], [[Pigeonberry Ash]], [[Rosewood]] and [[Soft Corkwood]] trees predominate.<ref name="naq"/>

Many of Lamington's plants are found nowhere else on earth, such as O<U+2019>Reilly's [[Pittosporum]] (''Pittosporum oreillyanum''), the Lamington Peach Myrtle (''[[Uromyrtus]] lamingtonensis''), and the Mt Merino [[Eyebright]] and [[Everlasting Daisy]] which are [[subalpine]] relics from the last [[ice age]]. In 2006 it was realised that an old collection of the Eastern Underground Orchid (''[[Rhizanthella slateri]]'') from Lamington was actually a separate species and has been described as the Lamington Underground Orchid (''[[Rhizanthella omissa]]''). This Orchid like the two other related species has no [[chlorophyll]] and depends entirely upon a [[symbiotic]] fungus for survival. It is also one of only four flowering plants on Earth to complete its life cycle entirely underground. Sadly one of Lamington's more than 100 fern species is now presumed extinct, ''[[Antrophyum austroqueenslandicum]]'' was known from only a single plant which has since died and no other plants have been found. Lamington is also home to a large number of threatened plant species such as the Ravine and Blotched ''Sarchochilus'' [[orchid]]s.

===Fauna===
The area is one of the most important wildlife refuges in the region.<ref name="xqnp"/> Lamington is home to an incredible [[biodiversity|variety of wildlife]] including rare and threatened animals such as the [[Coxen<U+2019>s fig parrot]], [[Eastern Bristlebird]], [[Albert's Lyrebird]], Richmond [[Birdwing butterfly]]. The blue [[Lamington Crayfish]] is found only on the Lamington plateau in pools and streams above an altitude of 450&nbsp;m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lamington.nrsm.uq.edu.au/Documents/Anim/yab.htm |title=Lamington Spiny Crayfish |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=Waterlife of Lamington National Park }}</ref> The vulnerable [[Large-eared Pied Bat]] is found in the park. Other rare species include the [[Rainforest Cool-skink]], [[Elf Skink]] and numerous frog species including the [[Fleay's Barred Frog]], [[Giant Barred Frog]] and the [[Cascade Treefrog]].<ref name="xqnp"/> [[Red-necked Pademelons]] can be seen near the edges of the rainforest and [[platypus]] may be spotted in the deeper rock pools.<ref name="naq"/>

===Geology===
The Lamington National Park is located on the northern side of the [[Tweed volcano]]. This large [[shield volcano]] is over 100&nbsp;km in diameter, and extends from [[Mount Tamborine]] in the north to [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] in the south. The volcanic plug of [[Mount Warning]] marks the centre of the volcano. This volcano was active around 23 million years ago <ref>Knesel K. M., Cohen B.E., Vasconcelos P. M., and Thiede D.S. (2008) Rapid change in drift of the Australian plate records collision with Ontong Java Plateau, Nature vol 454, pages 754<U+2013>757.</ref> when this part of Australia was above a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the mantle. Both [[basaltic]] and [[rhyolitic]] lavas were erupted, and erosion of these lavas from rain and running water has formed the many spectacular landforms including cliffs, now observed in the park. Under these layers is a layer of [[tuff]] made from volcanic ash and fine rock which is up to 60&nbsp;m thick in some places.<ref name="lackner"/> Near Binna Burra the maximum thickness of the basalt layer is estimated to be 700&nbsp;m.<ref name="naq"/>

===Waterfalls===
[[Image:Elabana Falls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elabana Falls]]]]
The park contains more than 500 waterfalls,<ref name="asm">{{cite web |url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/agriculture/statistics/qld/sd-morton.html |title=Agriculture <U+2013> Statistics <U+2013> Moreton |work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas |publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities |accessdate=26 January 2011 }}</ref> including [[Elabana Falls]] and Running Creek Falls in the south of the park which falls into a [[box canyon]]. [[Yarrbilgong Falls]] and [[Coomera Falls]] both flow into Coomera Gorge. Morans Falls is another cascade that is passed on the 6&nbsp;km long Morans Falls Track. Upper Ballanjui Falls, Lower Ballanjui Falls, Stairway Falls and Nagarigoon Falls are also located in the national park.

==Bushwalking==
[[Image:Ships Stern Lamington National Park.jpg|thumb|right|The view from a lookout on the 19 km&nbsp;long Ships Stern Circuit.]]
The park is covered by more than {{Convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} of clearly marked walks that were constructed during the [[Great Depression]] and designed by Romeo Lahey. Lahey studied dairy cow movements on the surrounding hills, noticing that their paths never had a gradient of greater that 1:10. He laid out the parks tracks in a similar manner so that walkers would not be out of breath.<ref name="lackner"/> Where steep terrain was unavoidable, steps were used instead of a steep track.

Some are short and others are steep and take up to seven hours to complete. The well maintained and signed Border Track, follows the border between New South Wales and Queensland along the top of the [[McPherson Range]]. This track links Binna Burra to the O'Reilly guesthouse at Green Mountains, a distance of some 23 kilometres which can be completed one way in a day or in 7 to 8 hours.

A number of other well marked and varied walks connect with this Border Track creating a network which can be easily negotiated by relatively inexperienced bushwalkers.  These include the Box Forest Circuit (10.9&nbsp;km or 4 hours return from O'Reilly's), Toolona Creek Circuit (17.4&nbsp;km or 6 hours return), and the Albert River Circuit (20.6&nbsp;km or 7 hours return to O'Reilly's) to name some of the best known. While the Border Track remains reasonably level for most of its length, many of the other tracks descend to lower altitudes of 750&nbsp;metres or less and provide access to some of the diverse variety of flora, fauna and geography to be found in the park.

Another attraction is the Tree Top Walk, suspended 15&nbsp;m above the ground.<ref name="xqnp"/> This walk provides the opportunity to safely walk through the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] of the forest along a series of suspension bridges. Climbing a ladder up a strangler fig takes visitors to an observation deck 30&nbsp;m above the ground.<ref name="xqnp"/>

For experienced walkers there are also numerous trails traversing the park. These trails do not have clear tracks; in many cases there are only occasional markers in the natural forest and it is inadvisable to use them without the company of an experienced bushwalker who knows the area. The walk to the Stinson wreck is long and steep in places. Map reading and good navigation skills are a necessity and National Park Rangers should be notified before commencing. Camping overnight is not permitted without a permit. There are a number of natural hazards such as [[leech]]es, [[snake]]s and stinging trees that bushwalkers should be aware of.

==Accommodation==
In addition to guest houses, there is also a camp ground available and limited bush camping throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web
