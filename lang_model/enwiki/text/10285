== Views of medical organizations ==
A number of major medical organizations such as the [[American Medical Association]], [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], [[World Health Organization]] and the United States [[National Cancer Institute]] have analyzed larger studies regarding induced abortion and breast cancer. Their uniform conclusion is that there is no causative link between induced abortion and breast cancer.<ref name="WHO"/><ref name="ACOG2009" /><ref name="rcog_2000"/><ref name="NCI"/>

The [[American Cancer Society]] noted with concern that: "The issue of abortion generates passionate viewpoints in many people. Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and is the second leading cancer killer in women (lung cancer is the first). Still, the public is not well-served by false alarms. At this time, the scientific evidence does not support the notion that abortion of any kind raises the risk of breast cancer."<ref name="ACS_concern">{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/MoreInformation/is-abortion-linked-to-breast-cancer | title = Is Abortion Linked to Breast Cancer? | accessdate = 2011-03-12 | publisher = [[American Cancer Society]]}}</ref>

==Proponents==
[[Joel Brind]] is a professor of biology and [[endocrinology]] at [[Baruch College]] and is the primary advocate of an abortion-breast cancer (ABC) link. While Brind is pro-life and his goal to prove an ABC link, he has published papers in respected journals on other human hormone topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/departments/natural_science/faculty/brind.html|title=Joel Brind, Department of Natural Sciences|publisher=Baruch College|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>  He has fought against the legalization of [[RU-486]] testifying at a federal hearing that "thousands upon thousands" of women would develop breast cancer as a result of using the drug.<ref name="CWA_RU">{{cite web |url=http://www.cwfa.org/familyvoice/2000-11/14-19.asp |title=Concerned Women for America <U+2013> Family Voice |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 1996, Brind published a meta-analysis in the ''Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health'' (JECH) which was immediately criticized in a ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute'' editorial for concluding [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#Response bias|response bias]] was unlikely to have affected their results, "dismissal of the study's limitations, and their blurring of association with causation."<ref name="WEED">{{cite journal |author=Weed DL, Kramer BS |title=Induced abortion, bias, and breast cancer: why epidemiology hasn't reached its limit |journal=J.

In 2003, Brind was invited to the [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#National Cancer Institute|NCI workshop]], where he was the only one to formally dissent.

Karen Malec, a former teacher and pro-life activist, started the Coalition on Abortion-Breast (CAB) in 1999 with help from [[Concerned Women for America]],<ref name="JASEN"/> a conservative Christian U.S. political action group which lobbies for legislation recognizing an abortion-breast cancer link.

==Proposed mechanism==
[[Image:Breast anatomy drawing.png|thumb|200px|Lobules are 3, ducts are 6.]]

While research has shown the protective benefits of full-term pregnancy and lactation in reducing the risk of breast cancer, these benefits are only fully realized in the third trimester when differentiation of new breast growth takes place. The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis posits that if a pregnancy is aborted prior to differentiation it could have an adverse effect by creating and leaving behind more immature cells to be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time.

Breast tissue contains many [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobe]]s (segments) and these contain lobules which are groups of breast cells. There are four types of lobules:

*Type 1 has 11 [[Duct (anatomy)|ductules]] (immature)
*Type 2 has 47 ductules (immature)
*Type 3 has 80 ductules (mature, fewer [[hormone receptor]]s)
*Type 4 are fully matured ([[cancer]] resistant) and contain [[breast milk]]

During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules quickly become type 2 lobules because of changes in estrogen and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] as type 4 lobules requires an increase of [[human placental lactogen]] (hPL) which occurs in the last few months of pregnancy. According to the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy.<ref name="bcp">{{cite web |url=http://bcpinstitute.org/reproductive.htm#R2 |title=Reproductive Breast Cancer Risks Brochure |accessdate=2007-10-20 |work=}}</ref> Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA [[DNA repair|repair]] with longer [[cell cycle]]s<ref name="ANNIE"/> which would account for the reduced risk of parturition against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.<ref name="RUSSO"/>

Later on, Russo ''et al.'' found that placental [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) induces the synthesis of [[inhibin]] by the mammary epithelium.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alvarado MV, Alvarado NE, Russo J, Russo IH |title=Human chorionic gonadotropin inhibits proliferation and induces expression of inhibin in human breast epithelial cells in vitro |journal=In Vitro Cell.

==Background==
The first study involving statistics on abortion and breast cancer was a broad study in 1957,<ref name="JASEN"/> which  examined common cancers in [[Japan]]. The researchers were cautious about drawing any conclusions from their unreliable methodologies. During the 1960s several studies by [[Brian MacMahon]] et al. in Europe and Asia touched on a correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Their 1973 paper published in the ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute'' inaccurately<ref name="JASEN"/> concluded that "where a relationship was observed, abortion was associated with increased, not decreased, risk."<ref>{{cite journal |author=B MacMahon, P Cole, and J Brown |title=Etiology of human breast cancer: a review |journal=J. Nat. Cancer Inst. |volume=50 |issue=21<U+2013>42 |page=22 |year=1973 | pmid = 4571238 |pages=21<U+2013>42}}</ref> Research relevant to the current ABC discussion focuses on more recent large [[Cohort study|cohort studies]], a few [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], many [[case-control]] studies and several early experiments with [[Laboratory rat|rats]].

===Rats===
Russo & Russo from the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]] in [[Philadelphia]] conducted a study in 1980 which examined the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing the effects of the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer.<ref name="RUSSO"/> However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, like hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis.  A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, which confirmed the results.<ref name="RUSSO2"/> A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings.<ref name="RUSSO3"/> After differentiation of the [[mammary gland]] resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for [[DNA]] [[DNA repair|repair]].<ref name="RUSSO3"/><ref name="ANNIE">{{cite web |url=http://www.annieappleseedproject.org/addietrisofb.html |title=Adolescent Diet & Risk of Bca |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=annieappleseedproject.org}}</ref>

Despite the fact that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and pregnancy interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jasen |first=Patricia |date=1 October 2005|title=Breast Cancer and the Politics of Abortion in the United States |journal=Medical History |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=423<U+2013>444 |quote=Their study supported the theory that structural changes in breast tissue are responsible for the lasting, protective effect of full-term pregnancy. They observed that abortion left the rats highly susceptible to developing cancer, but that the aborted rats <U+201C>were ''at the same risk'' as virgin animals treated with the carcinogen<U+201D> (italics mine). Over the next two decades, however, their findings would be cited repeatedly as evidence that pregnancy begins a process of breast change which, when stopped by abortion, put female rats (and thus humans) at greater risk of cancer than those who had never been pregnant. |pmid=16562329 |pmc=1251638 }}</ref> In a [[Discover Magazine|Discover]] article sidebar entitled ''Humans Are Not Rats'', Gil Mor, the director of reproductive immunology at the [[Yale University|Yale University School of Medicine]], disagrees with Brind on the importance of the rat studies findings.  Mor emphasizes that rat studies are ideal for understanding basic processes but because rats have neither breasts nor breast cancer, people like Brind are on "wobbly" terrain.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yeoman|first=Barry |url=http://www.barryyeoman.com/articles/hatedabortion.html |title=Scientist Who Hated Abortion |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=Discover}}</ref>

==Epidemiological studies==
The majority of the results in [[epidemiology]] are calculated as a [[relative risk]], where 1.0 is no risk; results above, like 1.21, is a 21% increased risk and results below, such as 0.8 is a 20% decreased risk. Relative risks are not necessarily significant. To help assess this a relative risk is followed by a [[confidence interval]] in brackets that shows the likelihood (with 95% confidence) that the relative risk is of significance. Any relative risk with a confidence interval that does not include a value of 1 could be considered significant. For example, the confidence intervals (0.3 <U+2013> 0.9) and (1.5 <U+2013> 7.8) are statistically significant, whereas the confidence intervals (0.89 <U+2013> 7.34) or (0.5 <U+2013> 1.1) are not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=18&objID=901787&mode=2. |title=Tools of the Trade: The Notion of Risk |accessdate=2011-03-12 |format=PDF |work=}}</ref> With more data the confidence interval becomes smaller; making it an indicator of the result's statistical reliability.

When a relative risk result actually becomes significant is a difficult and contentious issue.<ref name="JASEN" /> As a small result of 1.41 (1.1 <U+2013> 1.6) even a significant confidence interval (outside 1.0) may be inaccurate because of [[response bias]], incomplete data, missed [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#Confounding factors|confounding factor]]s, imprecise controls or statistical analysis. If these possible flaws are accounted for they could change the result and/or the confidence interval impacting its statistical significance.

The number of (X/Y ABC cases/controls) gives X as women in the study who have had abortion(s) (induced and/or spontaneous) with breast cancer and Y is women with breast cancer and no abortion history. This dataset is used when calculating the relative risk and provides a way to compare the size of one study to another.

===Confounding factors===
There are many [[Lurking variable|confounding factor]]s for breast cancer. [[Genetics]] is a major factor that affects not only a woman's initial breast cancer risk<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/factors/genetics.jsp |title=Cancer Risk and Abnormal Breast Cancer Genes |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=}}</ref> but also her [[Estrogen receptor#Cancer|hormonal sensitivity]], which in turn affects her susceptibility to a long list of socioeconomic and environmental factors. As [[Western world|Western society]] has modernized, [[natural environment|environmental]] [[carcinogens]], delayed child rearing, less [[breastfeeding]], [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), [[hormonal contraception]], early [[menarche]] and [[obesity]] have increased.

If unaccounted for these factors could obscure any individual variable. Scientific studies remove them using [[case-control]] methodology <U+2013> a woman who has had an abortion (case) is matched with a very similar woman with no abortion history (control) <U+2013> if this was not done a study could get a [[Type I and type II errors|false positive or negative]] result because of another factor. Examining the ABC issue is all the more difficult because the number of women with an induced abortion history has increased along with other factors in recent decades.<ref name="GUTTMACHER"/> [[Premature birth]] adds further complications since uncorroborated studies have indicated it is associated with a history of induced abortion<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moreau C |title=Previous induced abortions and the risk of very preterm delivery: results of the EPIPAGE study |journal=BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=430<U+2013>7 |year=2005 |pmid=15777440 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00478.x |author-separator=, |author2=Kaminski M |author3=Ancel PY |display-authors=3 |last4=Bouyer |first4=Jean |last5=Escande |first5=Benoit |last6=Thiriez |first6=Gerard |last7=Boulot |first7=Pierre |last8=Fresson |first8=Jeanne |last9=Arnaud |first9=Catherine}}</ref> and higher breast cancer risk.<ref name="MELBYE2"/> One of the most significant controllable factors for breast cancer is parity, or the number of children a women has given birth to. With each full-term pregnancy (particularly the first) the breasts undergo growth and differentiation (in the third trimester); consequently, having no children can increase breast cancer risk.<ref name="ACS">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/DetailedGuide/breast-cancer-risk-factors |title=ACS :: What Are the Risk Factors for Breast Cancer? |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=cancer.org}}</ref>

All of these confounding factors have an effect, directly or indirectly, on hormones which impact breast cancer risk, but they do not significantly affect the results of ABC studies that are properly conducted and take these factors into account with [[case-control]] matching. Hormones being a key factor for cancer risk is well established. Steroidal [[estrogen]] was added to the U.S. federal [[carcinogen]] list in December 2002.

The controversial nature of [[abortion]] may introduce [[response bias]] into interview studies, especially for studies done in decades past when abortion was less accepted;<ref name="WEED"/> however, the statistical significance of bias has yet to be confirmed. In the late 20th century there was some concern of an increase of breast cancer [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. This was found to be partly due to longer lifespans, and the development of better detection methods capable of finding breast cancer earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feuer EJ, Wun LM, Boring CC, Flanders WD, Timmel MJ, Tong T |title=The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer |journal=J.

===Cohorts===
====Howe====
The 1989 study by Holly Howe ''et al.'' at the [[New York]] State Department of Health examined young women with breast cancer in upstate New York (100/63 ABC cases/controls).<ref name="HOWE"/> The results indicated an increased 1.9 (1.2 <U+2013> 3.0) relative risk for induced abortion and 1.5 (0.7 <U+2013> 3.7) for spontaneous abortion. Although the study had 1451 breast cancer cases the number of individuals with an abortion history was low; consequently the confidence interval is quite large.

The authors believed that the study was inconclusive as fertility patterns were changing dramatically as a result of legal abortion and increased use of contraceptives. Further they did not have a complete reproductive history of younger women who may still have children affecting the results going forward, but Howe ''et al.'' concluded it raised new questions for continuing research as women's recorded contraceptive histories grew. Newcomb and Michels point out it examined only very young women and did not account for some confounding factors such as family history of breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/the-courts/020217/judge-rule-abortion-breast-cancer-link |title=Judge to Rule on Abortion, Breast Cancer Link |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=womensenews.org}}</ref>

====Lindefors-Harris====
Another cohort study by Lindefors-Harris ''et al.'' (1989) was done looking at 49,000 women who had received abortions before the age of 30 in Sweden (65 ABC cases <U+2013> compared with estimate of occurrence in the general population).<ref name="LH1989">{{cite journal |author=Harris BM, Eklund G, Meirik O, Rutqvist LE, Wiklund K |title=Risk of cancer of the breast after legal abortion during first trimester: a Swedish register study |journal=BMJ |volume=299 |issue=6713 |pages=1430<U+2013>2 |year=1989 |pmid=2514825 |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6713.1430 |pmc=1838310}}</ref> The relative risk for women who'd given birth previous to the abortion was 0.58 (0.38 <U+2013> 0.84), whereas women with no births had a relative risk of 1.09 (0.71 <U+2013> 1.56). The confidence intervals did not establish statistically significant associations between breast cancer and different stages of reproduction, including abortion. Overall, the relative risk was 0.77 (0.58 <U+2013> 0.99), making for a 23% reduced risk in comparison to "contemporary Swedish population with due consideration to age."<ref name="LH1989"/>

The study was funded by [[Family Health International]],<ref name="LH1989"/> a pro-choice [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and although the study started with 49,000 women there were fewer than 5,000 still in the study after 11 years.<ref name="Kahlenborn">{{cite web |url=http://lifeissues.net/writers/kah/kah_08chap6cancabor.txt |title=CHAPTER 6: BREAST CANCER AND ABORTION|accessdate=2008-01-23 |work=lifeissues.net |author=Chris Kahlenborn}}</ref> Lindefors-Harris made no adjustments for family history of breast cancer and the pill,<ref name="LH1989"/> and provides no explanation for a lack of a control group or why the study was limited to women with an abortion before 30 years of age. Brind contends correcting for either of these removes the 23% "protective" effect; and that the study did not account for the difference of nulliparous women in the cohort 41% in comparison to 49% in the general population.<ref name="BRIND_LH">{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/air/air_vol5no3_1993.html |title=lifeissues.net &#124; Induced Abortion as an Independent Risk Factor for Breast Cancer |accessdate=2008-01-23 |work=lifeissues.net |author=Joel Brind}}</ref> Possibly making the protective result about parity (childbearing) rather than abortion.

====Melbye====
A large, highly regarded ABC study was published by Melbye ''et al.'' (1997) of the Statens Serum Institute in [[Copenhagen]], which had 1.5 million [[Denmark|Danish]] women in the study's database (1,338 ABC cases, no controls used).<ref name="MELBYE"/><ref name="NYT_Brody">{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E0DD1F39F93AA35752C0A961958260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Big Study Finds No Link In Abortion and Cancer <U+2013> New York Times |work=New York Times |author=Jane E. Brody |date=January 9, 1997 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> Of those women, 280,965 of them had induced abortions recorded in the computerized registry, which was started in 1973 when having an induced abortion through 12 weeks was legal in Denmark. Although there was an observed increased ABC risk with "increasing gestational age of the fetus at the time of the most recent induced abortion";<ref name="MELBYE"/> the overall relative risk after statistical adjustment came to 1.00 (0.94 <U+2013> 1.06), meaning zero breast cancer risk. This led to the conclusion that "induced abortions have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer."<ref name="MELBYE"/> The Melbye study's conclusions have been used by many organizations, such as NCI, ACOG, ACS, RCOG and [[Planned Parenthood]], as key scientific evidence of no ABC link.<ref name="HOUSE"/><ref name="PP">{{cite web |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/resources/research-papers/anti-choice-claims-about-abortion-breast-cancer-5095.htm |title=Planned Parenthood <U+2013> Anti-Choice Claims About Abortion and Breast Cancer |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=plannedparenthood.org}}</ref>

Brind and Chinchilli had concerns about the Melbye study database as women in the study were born from 1935 to 1978, but the computerized registry of induced abortions only started in 1973.<ref name="BRINDLET">{{cite journal |author=Brind J, Chinchilli VM |title=Induced abortion and the risk of breast cancer |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=336 |issue=25 |pages=1834; author reply 1835 |year=1997 |pmid=9190496 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199706193362514}}</ref> Melbye ''et al.'' responded that if the misclassified older women had their risk underestimated, it would be expected that the younger groups would have a higher risk. The statistically adjusted data indicated this was not the case.

However, the statistical adjustments made were another concern of Brind who argues that the Melbye study accidentally adjusted out induced abortion from the overall results. Instead of case-control matching, Melbye ''el al.'' decided to manually remove the many confounding factors that increased over time (e.g. smoking, late child bearing, etc.) and were raising breast cancer risk for younger women relative to older women (birth-cohorts). Brind believes finding exactly zero ABC risk was a consequence and red flag indicating ABC risk was removed along with the confounding factors.<ref name="BRINDLET"/> Melbye ''et al.'' found the point to be self-contradictory, considering Brind wanted birth-cohort matching, then argued against "taking birth-cohort differences into account."<ref name="BRINDLET"/> Brind has stated that he is against the use of just statistical adjustment and that standard [[case-control]] matching may more accurately account for birth-cohort differences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abortionbreastcancer.com/article_two.htm |title=ABC in the courts |accessdate=2008-03-21 |work=abortionbreastcancer.com |author=Joel Brind}}</ref>

Other sections listed age at induced abortion, number of induced abortions, time since induced abortion, and time of induced abortion and live-birth history.

====Michels====
A study by Michels ''et al.'' (2007) from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] containing 105,716 women (233/1,225 ABC cases/controls) concluded with a relative risk of 1.01 (0.88 <U+2013> 1.17) "after adjustment for established breast cancer risk factors."<ref name="Michels"/> Some of the results lead the authors to stipulate: "Although our data are not compatible with any substantial overall relation between induced abortion and breast cancer, we cannot exclude a modest association in subgroups defined by known breast cancer risk factors, timing of abortion, or parity." This modest association was mostly not statistically significant.

====Further cohort studies====
Several other recent prospective [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] have also found little evidence of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer. A study of 267,361 European women (746/2,908 ABC cases/controls), published in 2006, found no significant ABC risk.<ref name="epic">{{cite journal |author=Reeves G, Kan S, Key T, Tj<U+00F8>nneland A, Olsen A, Overvad K, Peeters P, Clavel-Chapelon F, Paoletti X, Berrino F, Krogh V, Palli D, Tumino R, Panico S, Vineis P, Gonzalez C, Ardanaz E, Martinez C, Amiano P, Quiros J, Tormo M, Khaw K, Trichopoulou A, Psaltopoulou T, Kalapothaki V, Nagel G, Chang-Claude J, Boeing H, Lahmann P, Wirf<U+00E4>lt E, Kaaks R, Riboli E |title=Breast cancer risk in relation to abortion: Results from the EPIC study |journal=Int.

===Meta-analysis===
====Beral====
In March 2004, Beral ''et al.'' published a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' as a collaborative reanalysis on ''Breast cancer and abortion''.<ref name="BERAL">{{cite journal |author=Beral V, Bull D, Doll R, Peto R, Reeves G |title=Breast cancer and abortion: collaborative reanalysis of data from 53 epidemiological studies, including 83?000 women with breast cancer from 16 countries |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9414 |pages=1007<U+2013>16 |year=2004 |pmid=15051280 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15835-2}}</ref> This meta-analysis of 53 epidemiologic studies of 83,000 women with breast cancer undertaken in 16 countries did not find evidence of a relationship between induced abortion and breast cancer, with a relative risk of 0.93 (0.89 <U+2013> 0.96).

Brind maintains that like meta-analysis this study is subject to [[selection bias]], which he believes is reflected in the removal of 15 published, peer-reviewed studies with positive ABC results for "unscientific reasons"; and including 28 unpublished studies that outnumber the remaining 24 peer reviewed studies.<ref name="BRIND FS">{{cite web |url=http://bcpinstitute.org/beralpaperanalysis.htm |title=Breast Cancer Prevention Institute Fact Sheets |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=}}</ref> Beral refers to the Lindefors-Harris response bias study as an explanation for higher ABC risk found in interview based studies,<ref name="LH1991"/> however Brind notes in 1998 that Lindefors-Harris conceded their initial conclusion may have been unsound.<ref name="MEIRIK">{{cite journal |author=Meirik O, Adami HO, Eklund G |title=Relation between induced abortion and breast cancer |journal=Journal of epidemiology and community health |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=209<U+2013>11 |year=1998 |pmid=9616432 |doi=10.1136/jech.52.3.209 |pmc=1756684}}</ref>

====Brind====
Brind ''et al.'' (1996) conducted a meta-analysis of 23 epidemiologic studies.<ref name="BRIND">{{cite journal |author=Brind J, Chinchilli VM, Severs WB, Summy-Long J |title=Induced abortion as an independent risk factor for breast cancer: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis |journal=Journal of epidemiology and community health |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=481<U+2013>96 |year=1996 |pmid=8944853 |doi=10.1136/jech.50.5.481 |pmc=1060338}}</ref> It calculated that there was on average a relative risk of 1.3 (1.2 <U+2013> 1.4) increased risk of breast cancer. The meta-analysis was criticized for [[selection bias]] by using studies with widely varying results, using different types of studies, not working with the raw data from several studies, and including studies that have possible methodological weaknesses.<ref name="WEED"/>

The strong reaction to the study particularly in Britain and the United States prompted the editor-in-chief Stuart Donnan to write an editorial. In it he notes:

<blockquote>However, in the light of recent unease about appropriate but open communication of risks associated with oral contraceptive pills, it will surely be agreed that open discussion of risks
is vital and must include the people <U+2013> in this case the women <U+2013> concerned. I believe that if you take a view (as I do), which is often called 'pro-choice', you need at the same time to have a view which might be called 'pro-information' without excessive paternalistic censorship (or interpretation) of the data.<ref name="Donnan">{{cite journal |author=Donnan S |title=Abortion, breast cancer, and impact factors<U+2014>in this number and the last |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=50 |issue=6 |page=605 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=9039374 |pmc=1060372 |doi=10.1136/jech.50.6.605 }}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (RCOG) in March 2000 published evidence-based guidelines on women requesting induced abortion. The review of the available evidence at the time was "inconclusive" regarding the ABC link. They also noted "Brind's paper had no methodological shortcomings and could not be disregarded."<ref name="rcog_2000">{{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf |title=The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion |page=43 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=2008-06-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627022119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf |archivedate = June 27, 2008}}</ref> However, in 2003 the RCOG concluded that there was no link between abortion and breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion |accessdate=2007-11-07 |work=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031105921/http://www.rcog.org.uk/resources/Public/pdf/induced_abortionfull.pdf |archivedate = October 31, 2007}}</ref> Some of the ABC studies RCOG reference as evidence (pg. 77) have been heavily criticized by Brind in 2005.<ref name="Brind2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.jpands.org/vol10no4/brind.pdf |format=PDF|title=A Critical Review of Recent Studies Based on Prospective Data |accessdate=2008-04-01 |work=jpands.org |author=Joel Brind}}</ref>

===Interviews===
Interview (case-control) based studies have been inconsistent on the ABC hypothesis.  With the small numbers involved in each individual study and the possibility that recall bias skewed the results, recent focus has switched to meta-analysis and record based studies which are typically much larger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_canc.htm |title=Is there a link between abortion and breast cancer? A balanced review |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=religioustolerance.org}}</ref> Included are a few interview studies of note.

====Daling====
Janet Daling from the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] headed two studies on the ABC issue looking at women in Washington state. The 1994 study (845/961 ABC cases/controls) results indicated an associated relative risk of 1.5 (1.2 <U+2013> 1.9) among women who had given birth before having an abortion.<ref name="DALING">{{cite journal |author=Daling JR, Malone KE, Voigt LF, White E, Weiss NS |title=Risk of breast cancer among young women: relationship to induced abortion |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=86 |issue=21 |pages=1584<U+2013>92 |year=1994 |pmid=7932822 |doi=10.1093/jnci/86.21.1584}}</ref> This was reflected in higher risks for women younger than 18 or older than 30 years of age who have had abortions after 8 weeks' gestation. Their conclusion emphasized that although the evidence suggested the possibility of a correlative relationship, their findings were not consistent enough to establish one.

The second larger study Daling conducted in 1996 (1,302/1,180 ABC cases/controls) found that abortion was associated with a relative risk value of 1.2 (1.0 <U+2013> 1.5).<ref name="DALING2"/> The study also found a significant relative risk of 2.0 (1.2 <U+2013> 3.3) for nulliparous women with an induced abortion at less than 8 weeks gestation. Daling ''et al.'' concluded that:

{{cquote|There was no excess risk of breast cancer associated with induced abortion among parous women. These data support the hypothesis that there may be a small increase in the risk of breast cancer related to a history of induced abortion among young women of reproductive age. However, the data from this study and others do not permit a causal interpretation at this time; neither do the collective results of the studies suggest that there is a subgroup of women in whom the relative risk associated with induced abortion is unusually high.<ref name="DALING2"/>}}

Daling ''et al.'' examined the possibility of response bias by comparing results from two recent studies on invasive cervical cancer and ovarian cancer. The results argued against significant response bias. However, Rookus (1996) study noted that patients with cervical cancer may report differently than breast cancer patients.<ref name="ROOKUS">{{cite journal |author=Rookus MA, van Leeuwen FE |title=Induced abortion and risk for breast cancer: reporting (recall) bias in a Dutch case-control study |journal=J.

====Further interview studies====
A 2001 study (1,459/1,556 ABC cases/controls) conducted in [[Shanghai]], [[China]] by Sanderson ''et al.'' from the [[University of South Carolina]] and South Carolina Cancer Center at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] concluded that there was no ABC link and that multiple abortions did not put one at greater risk.<ref name="sanderson">{{cite journal |author=Sanderson M |title=Abortion history and breast cancer risk: results from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study |journal=Int.

The [[Istanbul University]] Medical Faculty published a study in 2009 (742/930 ABC cases/controls) of outpatients from clinics, authored by Ozmen ''et al.'' it found a 1.31 (1.13 <U+2013> 1.53) increased ABC risk. The authors point out various potential biases such as [[selection bias|selection]], [[Information bias (epidemiology)|information]] and even [[Selection bias#Sampling bias|hospital admission bias]] may have impacted their results. They believe the large pool of patients available to them and the resulting large size of the study "provided reasonably stable risk estimates."<ref name="Turkish">{{cite journal |author=Ozmen, Vahit |title=Breast cancer risk factors in Turkish women <U+2013> a University Hospital based nested case control study |journal=World Journal of Surgical Oncology |volume=7 |issue=37 |pages=708<U+2013>14 |year=2009 |pmid= |doi=10.1186/1477-7819-7-37 |last2=Ozcinar |first2=Beyza |last3=Karanlik |first3=Hasan |last4=Cabioglu |first4=Neslihan |last5=Tukenmez |first5=Mustafa |last6=Disci |first6=Rian |last7=Ozmen |first7=Tolga |last8=Igci |first8=Abdullah |last9=Muslumanoglu |first9=Mahmut}}</ref>

====Response bias====
[[Response bias]] occurs when women intentionally "underreport" their abortion history, meaning that they deny having an abortion or claim to have fewer abortions than they actually had. This can happen because of the personal and controversial nature of abortion, which may cause women to not want to provide full disclosure. Women in control groups are less likely to have serious illnesses, and hence have less motivation to be truthful than those trying to diagnose their problem.<ref name="ROOKUS"/> When this occurs, it artificially creates an ABC link where none exists. Three major studies have been published examining abortion response bias.

An editorial by Weed and Kramer focused on how [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#Brind|Brind's meta-analysis]] dismissed bias as a factor. The editorial cites the Lindefors-Harris [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#Lindefors-Harris 2|response bias study]] that used a "registry-based gold standard to show that healthy women consistently and widely underreport their history of abortion."<ref name="WEED"/><ref name="LH1991"/> Weed and Kramer considered this compelling evidence there could be systematic bias within the studies included in the meta-analysis. However, subsequently the Lindefors-Harris conclusion was quietly retracted in 1998.<ref name="MEIRIK"/> Weed and Kramer believed a causal conclusion was a "leap beyond the bounds of inference" and concluded:

<blockquote>
Because bias impedes our vision ''and'' is subject to sound inquiry, we are far from reaching a scientific "limit". Indeed, after this excursion into the issue of abortion, bias, and breast cancer, it seems our future has as much to do with human behavior as with human biology.<ref name="WEED"/>

A review of ABC studies was conducted by Bartholomew in 1998. It concluded that if studies least susceptible to response bias are considered, they suggest there is no association between abortion and breast cancer.<ref name="BARTHOLOMEW">{{cite journal |author=Bartholomew LL, Grimes DA |title=The alleged association between induced abortion and risk of breast cancer: biology or bias? |journal=Obstetrical & gynecological survey |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=708<U+2013>14 |year=1998 |pmid=9812330 |doi=10.1097/00006254-199811000-00024}}</ref> Chris Kahlenborn, M.D., a pro-life researcher and specialist in internal medicine, observes in his book ''Breast Cancer: Its Link to Abortion and the Birth Control Pill'' that if report bias were a significant factor in interview-based studies, then:

=====Lindefors-Harris=====
The Lindefors-Harris (1991) study (317/512 ABC cases/controls) was the first major study to examine response and recall bias.<ref name="LH1991">{{cite journal |author=Lindefors-Harris BM, Eklund G, Adami HO, Meirik O |title=Response bias in a case-control study: analysis utilizing comparative data concerning legal abortions from two independent Swedish studies |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=134 |issue=9 |pages=1003<U+2013>8 |year=1991 |pmid=1951288 |doi=}}</ref> It used the data of two independent [[Sweden|Swedish]] induced abortion studies, and concluded there was a 1.5 (1.1 <U+2013> 2.1) margin of error due to recall bias. However, eight women (seven cases, one control) included in this error margin apparently "overreported" their abortions, meaning the women reported having an abortion that was not reflected in the records. It was decided that for the purposes of the study, these women did not have abortions.<ref name="LH1991"/>

The 1994 Daling study examined the findings on overreporting of the Lindefors-Harris study and found it "reasonable to assume that virtually no women who truly did not have an abortion would claim to have had one."<ref name="DALING"/> In 1998 the co-authors of the Lindefors-Harris study acknowledged this in a letter:<ref name="MEIRIK"/>

<blockquote>We are not surprised to find some Swedish women confidentially reporting having had induced abortions during the period 1966<U+2013>1974 that are not recorded as legally induced abortions. It is plausible that such induced abortions are more susceptible to recall bias than induced abortions performed within the legal context in Sweden.</blockquote>

With the eight alleged overreporting women removed, the error margin was reduced from 50% to 16% which severely limits its statistical significance. Brind believes the remaining 16% could have resulted from the Swedish fertility registry<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meirik O, Lund E, Adami HO, Bergstr<U+00F6>m R, Christoffersen T, Bergsj<U+00F6> P |title=Oral contraceptive use and breast cancer in young women.

=====Rookus=====
The Rookus (1996) study (918 ABC cases/controls) compared two regions in the [[Netherlands]] to assess the effect of [[religion]] on ABC results based on interviews.<ref name="ROOKUS"/> The [[secular]] (western) and [[Social conservatism|conservative]] (southeastern) regions showed ABC relative risks of 1.3 (0.7 <U+2013> 2.6) and 14.6 (1.8 <U+2013> 120.0) respectively. Although this was a large variance, Brind ''et al.'' pointed out that it was attained with an extremely small sample size of 12 cases and 1 control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brind J, Chinchilli VM, Severs WB, Summy-Long J |title=Re: Induced abortion and risk for breast cancer: reporting (recall) bias in a Dutch case-control study |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=89 |issue=8 |pages=588<U+2013>90 |year=1997 |pmid=9106653 |doi=10.1093/jnci/89.8.588}}</ref>

Rookus ''et al.'' supported their finding with an analysis of how much recall bias existed with oral [[contraceptive]] use that could be verified through records. It corroborated the bias, but Brind's ''et al.'' letter argues that it only indicated response bias between the two regions, not between case and control subjects within regions. Rookus ''et al.'' responded by noting that there was a 4.5 month underreporting difference between control and case subjects in the conservative Catholic region. This was indirect evidence for a reporting bias since women's comfort levels with reporting oral contraception are theoretically higher than induced abortion. Rookus ''et al.'' also acknowledged the weakness in the Lindefors-Harris response bias study,<ref name="LH1991"/> but emphasized that more controls (16/59 = 27.1%) than case patients (5/24 = 20.8%) underreported registered induced abortions. They concluded that asserting a causal ABC link would be a disservice to the public and to epidemiological research when "bias has not been ruled out convincingly."<ref name="ROOKUS"/>

=====Tang=====
A study by Tang ''et al.'' (2000) (225/303 ABC cases/controls) done in Washington State found controls were not more reluctant to report induced abortion than women with breast cancer.<ref name="Tang">{{cite journal |author=Tang MT, Weiss NS, Daling JR, Malone KE |title=Case-control differences in the reliability of reporting a history of induced abortion |journal=Am.

Epidemiol. |volume=151 |issue=12 |pages=1139<U+2013>43 |year=2000 |pmid=10905525 |doi=}}</ref> Their results were that 14.0% of cases and 14.9% controls (a difference of <U+2212>0.9%) did not accurately report their abortion history. They do note likely underreporting occurring in certain sub-groups of women; such as older women in a Newcomb study reporting abortions prior to legalization,<ref name="Newcomb">{{cite journal |author=Newcomb PA, Storer BE, Longnecker MP, Mittendorf R, Greenberg ER, Willett WC |title=Pregnancy termination in relation to risk of breast cancer |journal=JAMA |volume=275 |issue=4 |pages=283<U+2013>7 |year=1996 |pmid=8544267 |doi=10.1001/jama.275.4.283}}</ref> and a predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] population in the Rookus study.<ref name="ROOKUS"/>

===Spontaneous abortion===
Studies of spontaneous abortions ([[miscarriage]]s) have generally shown no increase in breast cancer risk,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brewster DH, Stockton DL, Dobbie R, Bull D, Beral V |title=Risk of breast cancer after miscarriage or induced abortion: a Scottish record linkage case-control study |journal=Journal of epidemiology and community health |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=283<U+2013>7 |year=2005 |pmid=15767381 |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.026393 |pmc=1733063}}</ref> although a study by Paoletti concluded there is a "suggestion of increased risk" 1.2 (0.92 <U+2013> 1.56) after three or more pregnancy losses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paoletti X, Clavel-Chapelon F |title=Induced and spontaneous abortion and breast cancer risk: results from the E3N cohort study |journal=Int.

One of the problems with comparing miscarriage to abortion is the issue of hormone levels in early pregnancy, a key point because the ABC hypothesis rests on hormonal influence over breast tissue development. While it is true most miscarriages are not ''caused'' by low hormones, most miscarriages are ''characterized'' by low hormone levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-marys.nhs.uk/specialist/miscarriage_clinic/causes.htm  |title=The Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic <U+2013> What Causes Recurrent Miscarriage? |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=st-marys.nhs.uk |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050307221417/http://www.st-marys.nhs.uk/specialist/miscarriage_clinic/causes.htm |archivedate = 2005-03-07}}</ref> Kunz & Keller (1976) showed that when [[progesterone]] is abnormally low a miscarriage occurs 89% of the time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kunz J, Keller PJ |title=HCG, HPL, oestradiol, progesterone and AFP in serum in patients with threatened abortion |journal=British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology |volume=83 |issue=8 |pages=640<U+2013>4 |year=1976 |pmid=60125 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1976.tb00903.x}}</ref> Advocates of the ABC hypothesis argue that, given the association of most first trimester miscarriages with low hormone levels, spontaneous abortion is not analogous to an induced abortion.

==Politicization==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Abc waco billboard.jpg|thumb|left|260px|ABC billboard in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]] referring to the [[Race for the Cure|Komen Race for the Cure]].]] -->

Public interest in an association between abortion and breast cancer coincided with the rise of the militant pro-life movement which turned to [[Abortion related violence|violence]]. After the 1993 murder of physician [[Abortion related violence|David Gunn]] by a pro-life activist, mainstream pro-life organizations disavowed violent methods.<ref name="JASEN"/>

Pro-life organizations like National Right to Life turned to legal tactics that included lobbying against late-term abortions and [[RU-486]]. One of the other tactics adopted by the mainstream pro-life movement was promoting an alleged "ABC link". During the height of a publicized "breast cancer epidemic" pro-life organizations began to emphasize preliminary positive ABC results in an effort to further restrict abortion and to discourage women from having abortions.<ref name="JASEN"/> Currently, pro-life organizations lobby to increase obstacles to abortion, such as mandated [[counseling]], waiting periods, and parental notification,<ref name="GUTTMACHER"/> and some feel that pro-life advocates treat ABC as simply another tactic in their campaign against abortion.<ref name="ARTHUR"/> There have been ongoing and incremental legal challenges to abortion in the United States by pro-life groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/clinic/ |title=The Last Abortion Clinic |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=PBS.org}}</ref> In 2005, a [[Canada|Canadian]] pro-life organization put up [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s in [[Alberta]] with large [[pink ribbon]]s and the statement: "Stop the Cover-Up," in reference to the ABC hypothesis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/10/25/pink-ribbon051025.html |title=Group angered by billboards linking breast cancer to abortion |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=cbc.ca | date=2005-10-25}}</ref> The [[Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation]] was concerned the billboards misrepresented the state of scientific knowledge on the subject.<ref name="BERAL"/>

The continued focus on the "ABC link" by pro-life groups has created a confrontational political environment. Pro-choice advocates and scientists alike have responded with criticisms.<ref name="JASEN"/><ref name="MELBYE"/><ref name="WEED"/> The claims by pro-life advocates are sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenboob.org/ |title=Vote for the Golden Boob! |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=goldenboob.org}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref><ref name="CRLP"/> The extent with which politics has infused the ABC issue is illustrated by an editorial that quoted  [[Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis#Daling|Daling]] as saying:

{{cquote|If politics gets involved in science, it will really hold back the progress we make. I have three sisters with breast cancer, and I resent people messing with the scientific data to further their own agenda, be they pro-choice or pro-life.

During the late 1990s several United States [[Member of Congress|congressmen]] became involved in the ABC issue. In 1998, congressman [[Tom Coburn]] questioned a National Cancer Institute (NCI) official on why the NCI website contained out of date information on the ABC issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/105/26/ |title=Physicians For Life <U+2013> Abstinence, Abortion, Birth Control <U+2013> Need to Inform Patients of Abortion <U+2013> Breast Cancer Link |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=physiciansforlife.org}}</ref> Congressman [[Dave Weldon]] wrote a "Dear Colleague" letter to congress in 1999 shortly after the House debated [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval of the abortion drug [[Mifepristone]]; and partially as a result of John Kindley's law review on informed consent which was enclosed.<ref name="KINDLEY"/> In it Weldon expressed concern that the majority of studies indicate a possible ABC link and the politicization of the ABC issue is "preventing vital information from being given to women."<ref name="Weldon"/>

As of 2006, state law in [[Alaska]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Kansas]] requires warning women seeking abortions about a possible breast cancer risk, while [[Minnesota]] reflects the NCI workshop conclusion of no ABC link.<ref name="misconsent">[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/4/gpr090406.html#t1 Guttmacher] <U+2013> Misinformed Consent</ref> Similar [[legislation]] requiring notification has also been introduced, and was pending, in 14 other [[U.S. state|states]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/11/10/questions_on_states_abortion_warnings/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20National%20News |title=Questions on states' abortion warnings |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=The Boston Globe | date=2004-11-10 | first1=Laura | last1=Meckler}}</ref> An editor for the [[American Journal of Public Health]] expressed concern over how such legislative bills propose warnings that do not agree with established scientific findings.<ref name="Chavkin">{{cite journal |author=Chavkin W |title=Topics for our times: public health on the line<U+2014>abortion and beyond |journal=American journal of public health |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=1204<U+2013>6 |year=1996 |pmid=8806368 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.86.9.1204 |pmc=1380579}}</ref>

Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]] argues that the mandatory disclosure statutes might be unconstitutional on "[[rational basis]]" grounds, because childbirth is significantly more dangerous than abortion, data that is not required in any disclosure law, but which is necessary for a meaningful understanding of risks. According to Appel, "If the roughly fifty million abortions that have occurred in the United States since ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' had all ended in full-term deliveries, approximately five hundred additional women would have died during childbirth."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/abortion-a-healthy-choice_b_316825.html Abortion: The Healthy Choice]</ref>

===National Cancer Institute===
A report from the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] found that in November 2002, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] altered the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s (NCI) website. The previous NCI analysis had concluded that while some question regarding an association between abortion and breast cancer existed prior to the mid-1990s, a number of large and well-regarded studies such as Melbye ''et al.'' (1997) had resolved the issue; and there was no link between abortion and breast cancer. The Bush administration removed this analysis and replaced it with the following:

{{cquote|[T]he possible relationship between abortion and breast cancer has been examined in over thirty published studies since 1957. Some studies have reported statistically significant evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have had abortions, while others have merely suggested an increased risk. Other studies have found no increase in risk among women who have had an interrupted pregnancy.<ref name="HOUSE"/>}}

This alteration, which suggested that there was scientific uncertainty on the ABC issue, prompted an editorial in the [[New York Times]] describing it as an "egregious distortion" and a letter to the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] from members of Congress.<ref name="HOUSE"/> In response to the alteration the NCI convened a three-day consensus workshop entitled ''Early Reproductive Events and Breast Cancer'' on February 24<U+2013>26, 2003. The workshop concluded that induced abortion does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, and that the evidence for this was well established.<ref name="NCI"/> Afterwards, the director of epidemiology research for the American Cancer Society said, <U+201C>This issue has been resolved scientifically . . . . This is essentially a political debate."<ref name="HOUSE"/> 

Brind was the only one to file a dissenting opinion as a minority report criticizing the NCI's and Melbye's conclusions.<ref name="MINORITY">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcpinstitute.org/nci_minority_rpt.htm |title=Breast Cancer Prevention Institute |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=bcpinstitute.org}}</ref> Brind alleges the workshop evidence and findings were overly controlled by its organizers since Daling, who has published on the abortion-breast cancer issue, was asked to present on another topic.

Jasen notes: "A very public target of the anti-abortion movement has been the National Cancer Institute, not only for its dismissal of Daling's findings and uncritical support of Melbye's report, but also for the information supplied on its website, which potentially reaches millions of women around the world."<ref name="JASEN"/> Lawrence R.

===North Dakota lawsuit===
One example of the politicization of science is the case of ''Kjolsrud v. MKB Management Corporation''. In January 2000, Amy Jo Kjolsrud (n<U+00E9>e Mattson), a pro-life counselor, sued the Red River Women's Clinic in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]] alleging false [[advertising]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com |title=Abortion Clinic of Fargo |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=redriverwomensclinic.com}}</ref> The suit alleged the clinic was misleading women by distributing a brochure quoting a National Cancer Institute fact sheet on the ABC issue which stated:

:"Anti-abortion activists claim that having an abortion increases the risk of developing breast cancer and endangers future childbearing. '''None''' of these claims are supported by medical research or established medical organizations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_canc1.htm |title=Is there a link between abortion and breast cancer? A balanced review |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=religioustolerance.org}}</ref> (emphasis in original)

The case was originally scheduled for September 11, 2001, but was delayed as a result of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]]. On March 25, 2002, the trial started and after four days of testimony, Judge Michael McGuire ruled in favor of the clinic. In his decision, he said:

{{cquote|It does appear that the clinic had the intent to put out correct information and that their information is not untrue or misleading in any way. They did exercise reasonable care... One thing is clear from the experts, and that is that there are inconsistencies. The issue seems to be in a state of flux.}}

The judge noted it was their "intent" to provide accurate information because the brochure used an outdated 1996 fact sheet that stated there was "no established link", instead of the 1999 fact sheet wording of "inconsistent" evidence for the ABC issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondmainstream.com/archives/politics/feminist/abortion_breast_cancer.php |title=Beyond Mainstream <U+2013> alternative news, progressive politics, holistic healing, humor jokes, alternative media, alternative culture |accessdate=2007-10-20 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070607202036/http://www.beyondmainstream.com/archives/politics/feminist/abortion_breast_cancer.php |archivedate = June 7, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27027 |title=Judge rules in favor of abortion clinic |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=WorldNetDaily.com}}</ref> [[Linda Rosenthal]], an attorney from the Center for Reproductive Rights characterized the decision thus: "The judge rejected the abortion-breast cancer scare tactic.

Kindley Law Office: The ABC Link |accessdate=2007-11-07 |work=John Kindley}}</ref>

The decision was appealed and on September 23, 2003, to the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] which ruled the false advertising law should not have been used by Ms. Kjolsrud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t51c12.pdf |format=PDF|title=CHAPTER 51-12 FALSE ADVERTISING |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=legis.nd.gov}}</ref> This was because she personally had suffered no injury and hence had no standing (according to North Dakota [[jurisprudence]]) to file the lawsuit on behalf of others. In the appeal, Ms. Kjolsrud "concedes she had not read the brochures before filing her action."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=nd&vol=20030023&invol=1 |title=Amy Jo Kjolsrud v. MKB Management Corporation |accessdate=2007-11-04 |work=}}</ref> However, the appeal also noted that after the lawsuit was filed the abortion clinic updated their brochure to the following:

:"Some anti-abortion activists claim that having an abortion increases the risk of developing breast cancer. A substantial body of medical research indicates that there is no established link between abortion and breast cancer. In fact, the National Cancer Institute has stated, '[t]here is no evidence of a direct relationship between breast cancer and either induced or spontaneous abortion.'"

===Carroll===
In the Fall of 2007, Patrick S. Carroll published a statistical analysis in the ''[[Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carroll PS |title=The Breast Cancer Epidemic: Modeling and Forecasts Based on Abortion and Other Risk Factors |journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons |volume=12 |issue=3 |page=72 |date=Fall 2007 |url=http://www.jpands.org/vol12no3/carroll.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> a [[conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] journal with a pro-life stance.<ref>"[http://www.aapsonline.org/resolutions/2003-2.htm 2003 Resolution <U+2013> Affirming the Sanctity of Human Life]."

Retrieved on November 15, 2007.</ref> The study claimed that, among seven risk factors, abortion was the "best predictor of breast cancer," and fertility was also a useful predictor. It forecasts, for the year 2025, higher breast cancer rates for Czech Republic, England and Sweden and lower for Finland and Denmark based on abortion trends. In a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, Libby Brooks criticized Carroll's study, alleging that the study's methodology was flawed, that the study was funded by an anti-abortion group, and that it was published in a "right wing" journal.<ref>Brooks, Libby.

==Criticism of media coverage==
In an article entitled "Blinded by Science" for the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', Chris Mooney argues that "balanced" coverage by the media of the ABC hypothesis, among other scientific hypotheses championed by the religious right, is an example of how the scientific fringe manipulates public opinion by insisting on the illusory notion of journalistic "balance" instead of scientific accuracy. In the article, Mooney criticizes [[John Carroll (journalist)|John Carroll]] (former Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'') for a rebuke Carroll made regarding an article written by Scott Gold about the ABC hypothesis for the ''L.A. Times''.<ref name="Gold">{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/339453241.html?dids=339453241:339453241&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+22%2C+2003&author=Scott+Gold&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=THE+NATION%3B+Texas+OKs+Disputed+Abortion+Legislation |title=THE NATION; Texas OKs Disputed Abortion Legislation |accessdate=2008-03-04 |work=Los Angeles Times | first=Scott | last=Gold | date=2003-05-22}}</ref> Gold's article covered the National Cancer Institute (NCI) workshop, and Carroll notes that when a scientific advocate ([[Joel Brind]]) for the ABC hypothesis is found:

<blockquote>
It is not until the last three paragraphs of the story that we finally surface a professor of biology and endocrinology who believes the abortion/cancer connection is valid. But do we quote him as to why he believes this? No. We quote his political views.
<p>
Apparently the scientific argument for the anti-abortion side is so absurd that we don't need to waste our readers' time with it.<ref name="Carroll memo">{{cite web |url=http://www.laobserved.com/carrollmemo.html |title=L.A. Observed: John Carroll memo |accessdate=2008-03-04 |work=laobserved.com |author=John Carroll}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Carroll's concern is that Gold's article provides fodder to critics who claim that the ''L.A. Times'' has a liberal bias. Mooney writes in defense of Gold that:

<blockquote>
As a general rule, journalists should treat fringe scientific claims with considerable skepticism, and find out what major peer-reviewed papers or assessments have to say about them. Moreover, they should adhere to the principle that the more outlandish or dramatic the claim, the more skepticism it warrants. The Los Angeles Times<U+2019>s Carroll observes that <U+201C>every good journalist has a bit of a contrarian in his soul,<U+201D> but it is precisely this impulse that can lead reporters astray. The fact is, nonscientist journalists can all too easily fall for scientific-sounding claims that they can<U+2019>t adequately evaluate on their own.<ref name="Mooney">{{cite news | first = Chris | last = Mooney | authorlink = [[Chris Mooney]] | title = Blinded by Science | date = 2004-12 | work = Columbia Journalism Review }}</ref>
</blockquote>

Responding to criticism Carroll reiterated:

<blockquote>
You have an obligation to find a scientist, and if the scientist has something to say, then you can subject the scientist<U+2019>s views to rigorous examination.<ref name="Mooney"/>
