'''''Blackout''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by American [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Britney Spears]], released by [[Jive Records]] in October 27, 2007. Spears began working in this album as early as February 2006, exploring into [[electropop]] and [[urban pop]] and recording with new producers such as [[Danja]]. ''Blackout'' was her first studio album in four years since her 2003's "[[In the Zone]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0328342220071006 |title=Britney Spears Names New Album "Blackout" |author=Reuters |publisher=''[[Reuters News|Reuters]].com'' |date=October 6, 2007}}</ref> and marks the first time Spears is the [[executive producer]] of one of her albums.

The album received positive reviews from music critics, praising its production and deeming it as Spears' most thrilling album to date.

The album won "Album of the Year" at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2008]]. 

==Production==
In February 2006, it was reported that Britney was "in the midst of recording her next album," which could possibly be released later that year. According to the ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine article, Spears said her new music could "reinvigorate the current pop scene," which she said was "boring".<ref>{{cite web

"I can tell you there's some dance stuff; there's some slow, more introspective stuff; some club things," the producer said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1541093/20060918/spears_britney.jhtml |title=Britney's New Music Is 'The Next Level,' Producer Says |accessdate=2008-01-30 |author=Corey Moss |date=2006-09-18 |work=[[MTV|MTV.com]]}}</ref>

Britney Spears began working with [[Nate "Danja" Hills]] while she was pregnant with her second child. Recording began in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] and continued at Spears's home in Los Angeles.

Spears later revealed in a personal message on her official website that she planned to release her new album before the end of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003528425|title=Britney Coming Back 'Bigger And Better' In 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-30 |author=Gail Mitchell |date=2007-01-05 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] }}</ref> After various songs from ''Blackout'''s recording sessions were leaked onto the internet, it was announced in August 2007 that the Danja-produced "[[Gimme More]]" would be released as the album's first single.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003632483 |title=Britney Wants 'More' On New Danjahandz Track |accessdate=2008-01-30 |author=Jonathon Cohen |date=2007-08-28 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]}}</ref>

==Release==
Due to these numerous unauthorized online leaks, the [[Jive Records]] did everything possible to prevent and avoid any further illegal distribution of songs including moving up the release date of the album to October 30, 2007" a rep for [[Jive Records]] says in a statement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20151574,00.html |title=Britney Spears's Album Coming Early |author=Tim Nudd |publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]].com'' |date=October 10, 2007}}</ref> The album was released in the U.S., two weeks ahead of its planned release date of November 13, due to numerous unauthorized online leaks, and to prevent any future illegal distribution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1571557/20071010/spears_britney.jhtml |title=Britney Spears Plans An Early Blackout |accessdate=2008-01-30 |author=MTV News staff |date=2006-10-10 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The album had poor promotions because Spears had "other parts of her life that she had to focus on".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20241872_2,00.html|title=Britney Spears: 6 Possible Futures |last=Collis|first=Clark|work=Entertainment Weekly|pages=2|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

This is the first studio album for which Spears did not do any promotion prior to its release, with the exception of her performance at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Jive Records posted a commercial for the album on its official YouTube page.

In addition to the official "[[Piece of Me]]" music video, the "Britney Spears Wants a Piece of You" contest, in which fans could create videos for the "Piece of Me" single themselves using MTV's Video Remixer, began on November 30, 2007. The winning video aired on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' on December 20, 2007.  MTV, [[Jive Records]], and Spears herself chose the winner.

On November 13, 2007, U.S. store [[Target Corporation|Target]] released a special edition of ''Blackout'' with the bonus track, "Outta This World", a bonus mobile wallpaper, and a ringtone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iomusic.com/Bands_and_Artists/S/Spears__Britney/|title=Britney Spears: release |work=Iomusic Weekly|pages=2|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical===
The album received generally positive reviews from critics. However, those who gave the album mixed or poor reviews were mostly critical of Spears' highly publicized personal troubles at the time -insinuating that her "icy cold" and "withdrawn" singing style on the album was the product of her "chaotic" life, thus resulting in the need for so many collaborators to mask her less-than-energetic vocals.<ref>{{cite web

The album was received equally well in the United Kingdom, debuting at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]], her highest debut since her sophomore album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]'', which debuted at number two. The album quickly fell out of the top forty, however, it managed to remain in the top seventy-five through continued sales.  As a result of the success of the album's singles, "[[Gimme More]]", "[[Piece of Me]]", and "[[Break the Ice (Britney Spears song)|Break the Ice]]", the album climbed back into the top forty in its twenty second week of release, with a massive jump of eighteen places from number forty-three to number twenty-five in one week.<ref>[http://britneybreakstheice.blogspot.com/2008/04/uk-chart-update-for-week-ending-april_20.html Break The Ice: UK Chart Update For Week Ending April 20th<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The following week, the album climbed another six places and re-entered the top twenty, placing at number nineteen in the chart, and marking its ninth week back in the top forty.

In New Zealand, the album debuted at number eight on the [[RIANZ|New Zealand Albums Chart]], making it, at the time, Spears' highest debuting and charting album since ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' in 2000. Although it quickly fell off the chart, it re-entered after the success of "[[Piece Of Me]]," and climbed back up to number eleven where it stayed for three weeks. ''Blackout'' was certified Gold for sales of over 7,500 after fifteen weeks, and remained on the chart for twenty-one weeks.

The album was also successful in Australia, debuting at number three on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]] selling 9,987 copies<ref>http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=3367</ref> and has so far reached Platinum status, for shipments of over 70,000 copies.

According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([[IFPI]]), the album was number 32 in terms of units shipped worldwide by the end of 2007. As of June 2008, there have been 3.1 million digital downloads of the songs and remixes from the album in the United States.<ref name="billboard.com"/> It was ranked at number 50 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in its publication of the Top 50 albums of 2007.

==Promotion==
Britney Spears opened the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] with a performance of "Gimme More". It became perhaps the most talked-about televised [[song and dance]] routine since her friend [[Michael Jackson]]'s appearance a quarter century earlier on the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' special.  Her singing, her dancing and even her wardrobe were all commented on extensively.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/10/wbritney110.xml | title=Britney Spears disappoints in MTV comeback | author=Catherine Elsworth | publisher=Telegraph.co.uk | accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-09/07/content_6679217.htm | title=Britney Spears plans comeback at MTV Awards | publisher=news.xinhuanet.com | accessdate=2007-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN0921491220070910 | title=Britney Spears attempts comeback at MTV awards | publisher=Reuters | accessdate=2009-08-08 | author=Dean Goodman}}</ref> The performance was mostly considered disappointing and hurtful to her career. Following the performance, Spears herself did no more promotional work for the album. It was reported in March 2008 that Spears would embark on a world tour, but the tour never happened. She didn't perform in the U.S. again until the [[Circus Promo Tour]] for ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' on [[December 2]], 2008 during [[Good Morning America]].  

However, in the [[Ellen DeGeneres Show]], [[Ellen DeGeneres|Ellen]] herself did promote the album without Spears, she featured two songs of the album including "Toy Soldier" and "[[Gimme More]]" on her show, in which she danced along with the track and along with her studio audience.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNpBN0mPwJ4&feature=related | title=Ellen Dances To Britney's Toy Soldier | publisher=[[Youtube]] | date=2007 | accessdate=October 31, 2007}}</ref>

Spears eventually embarked on [[The Circus Starring: Britney Spears]] in March 3, 2009, which includes performances of "Piece of Me", "Radar", "Ooh Ooh Baby", "Hot as Ice" "Freakshow" and
"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)". The LAZRTAG remix of "Gimme More" is used during the Martial Arts Segue part of the show. "Break the Ice" is used in a video interlude set to Spears' music videos and using a sample of "[[Run the Show]]".

==Singles==
* "[[Gimme More]]" was the first single from ''Blackout''. Spears performed the song at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] on September 9, 2007. It was released earlier to [[radio station]]s on August 30, 2007, and as a digital download on [[iTunes]] on September 27, 2007. "Gimme More" became Spears' fourth highest peaking single after "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]", "[[...Baby One More Time]]", and "[[Circus]]", reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Since the release in September 2007, "Gimme More" has been certified Platinum in the U.S.

* "[[Piece of Me]]" was released as the second single from the album. The [[music video]] was shot on November 27, 2007, at Los Angeles restaurant and night club, Social Hollywood. It debuted at number 65 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, mostly due to its digital download sales, and peaked at number 18. It has also reached number one on the [[Irish Singles Chart]], number two in Australia and on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and number five on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].
