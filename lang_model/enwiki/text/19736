'''Black's Beach''' is a secluded section of beach beneath the bluffs of [[Torrey Pines]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]] in [[La Jolla]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is officially part of [[Torrey Pines State Beach]]. The northern portion of Black's Beach is owned and managed by the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]], while the southern portion of the beach, officially known as Torrey Pines City Beach, is jointly owned by the [[San Diego|city of San Diego]] and the state park, but is managed by the city of San Diego.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} <ref>http://www.sandiego.gov/lifeguards/beaches/blacks.shtml</ref> This distinction is important as Black<U+2019>s Beach is most known as a [[nude beach]], a practice that is no longer permitted in the southern portion managed by the city of San Diego.  There is no trash collection here.<ref>http://www.city-data.com/articles/Blacks-Beach-La-Jolla-California.html</ref>

Black's Beach was named for the Black family who had a horse farm overlooking the beach. They sold the land, and then it was subdivided into La Jolla Farms lots. The Farm's residents retained the Black family<U+2019>s private road to the beach.<ref>''La Jolla, A Celebration of Its Past''. Patricia Daly-lipe and Barbara Dawson</ref> Many mansions can be seen in the southern portion of the beach, including the Salk Mansion.  There is an inclined elevator lift that goes all the way down to the beach into a structure known by locals as the mushroom house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.san-diego-beaches-and-adventures.com/blacks-beach-ca.html |title=Blacks Beach CA - Secluded Blacks Beach in La Jolla California |publisher=San-diego-beaches-and-adventures.com |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref>

A [[submarine canyon]] funnels swells into Black's Beach, making it appealing to surfers but dangerous for inexperienced swimmers.<ref>{{cite web|author=POSTED: 5:56 pm PDT May 7, 2010 |url=http://www.10news.com/news/23491962/detail.html |title=2 Swimmers Rescued At Black's Beach - San Diego News Story - KGTV San Diego |publisher=10news.com |date=2010-05-07 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref>
Usually, lifeguards are at the beach until 6pm, from spring break until October.<ref>http://www.sandiego.com/beaches/blacks-beach</ref>
Due to budget cuts, lifeguard patrols were limited but have increased because of funding by UCSD.<ref>http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Beefing-Up-Lifeguards-at-Blacks-Beach--117551568.html</ref> Dolphins can be spotted swimming along the coast.<ref>http://www.bubbleinfo.com/2011/05/11/dolphins-at-blacks-beach/</ref> Stingrays can be found along the coast line when the water gets above 50 degrees.

==Location==
Black<U+2019>s Beach is located about three miles north of the popular [[La Jolla Shores]] beach in [[La Jolla]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], below the bluffs of Torrey Pines, which extend up to {{convert|300|ft|m|sing=on}} above the sandy beach. On the bluffs above Black<U+2019>s Beach are the [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]], [[Torrey Pines Municipal Golf Course]], [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]], and [[Torrey Pines State Reserve]]. To the north of Black<U+2019>s Beach lies the rest of [[Torrey Pines State Beach]], which altogether stretches {{convert|4.5|mi|km|sing=on}} from [[Del Mar, California]], past the [[Los Pe<U+00F1>asquitos Lagoon]] toward Scripps Beach in the south. The beach is near the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Nude beach==
Black's Beach in San Diego is perhaps the largest [[nude beach]] in the United States and is popular with Southern Californian [[nudism|nudists]] and [[naturism|naturists]]. Because Black's Beach was traditionally recognized as a clothing optional beach, nudity is tolerated for the portion of the beach that is managed by the state park.<ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2009-12-01 }}</ref>
Nudity has been prohibited on the city portion of Black's Beach since 1977. Prior to 1977 the city posted it as a "swimsuit optional" area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=495481 |title=NBC Evening News, Sept 21, 1977 |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1977-09-21 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}</ref> 

The clothing optional portion of Black's Beach begins about {{convert|100|yd|m|sing=on}} south of the trail head leading to the [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]], and runs north for approximately {{convert|1.1|mi|km|sing=on}} to the beached steel buoy south of Flatrock.<ref>{{cite web

==Surfing==
The southern portion of Black's Beach is known to [[surfers]] as one of the most powerful surf breaks in Southern California.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}<ref>http://www.lajollabeaches.org/blacks-beach/</ref> The [[waves]] gain their power due to the focusing effects of Scripps Canyon, an underwater canyon just offshore in the [[San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} <ref>http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/North_America/USA/California/San_Diego_County/blacks_beach/</ref>
Because of the sometimes large surf, fast breaking waves, and aggressive crowds, Black's is a dangerous surfing location, advisable for advanced surfers only.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Access==
Black<U+2019>s Beach can be difficult to access due to its location beneath the Torrey Pines bluffs. Landslides can occur, with tragic results.  Beachgoers are warned to avoid setting up beach sites too close to the cliffs.
<ref>http://www.surfermag.com/features/man-dies-blacks-cliffslide-torrey-pines-8-21-08/</ref> There are four access routes to Black<U+2019>s Beach.<ref>{{cite web

'''Torrey Pines Gliderport Trail''' <U+2013> the most popular route to Black<U+2019>s Beach is via the trail from the Gliderport, located between the [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]] and the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]]. This steep rugged trail down the {{convert|300|ft|m|sing=on}} cliffs is usually well maintained by local nudists of the beach, but the city of San Diego posted a <U+201C>Do Not Use<U+201D> sign there, as the Torrey Pines cliffs are unstable.  Visitors are advised to stay on the designated trails since many people have gotten stuck or even fallen to their deaths on the cliffs.<ref name=cbs8>{{cite web|title=Nude Woman Rescued on Cliffs at Blacks Beach|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/14301637/nude-woman-rescued-on-cliffs-at-blacks-beach|publisher=cbs8.com|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=ucsdguardian>{{cite web|last=Biebesheimer|first=Kyle|title=UCSD Freshman Dies in Fall at Blacks Beach|url=http://www.ucsdguardian.org/news/ucsdfreshmandiesinfallatblacksbeach/|work=12 February 2001|publisher=ucsdguardian.org|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=cbs82010>{{cite web|title=Woman's body found on cliff near Black's Beach|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/11985011/womans-body-found-on-cliff-near-blacks-beach|work=14 February 2010|publisher=cbs8.com|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>
