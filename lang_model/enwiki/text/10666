The '''men's sailors 100 metre freestyle''' was one of the four [[swimming]] events on the [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics]] programme.  The second swimming race was open only to sailors of the Greek Royal Navy.  Three took place in the event.  The top time was nearly a minute slower than that of the open 100 metre freestyle.

The exclusionary nature of this race is a rare phenomenon in the Olympic Games, which in general include only events open to all.  [[Bill Mallon]], in his book about the 1896 Games, says of the event that "its inclusion in the Olympic records is dubious at best".  However, the competition is included in the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s database of Olympic medallists and there is no record of [[Pierre de Coubertin]] or any other major figure in the beginning of the modern Olympic movement objecting to the consideration of the race as Olympic.
