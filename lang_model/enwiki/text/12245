'''''Inside No. 9''''' is a [[British dark comedy]] [[anthology series|anthology]] television programme written by [[Reece Shearsmith]] and [[Steve Pemberton]] and produced by the BBC. The first series was broadcast between 5 February and 12 March 2014 on [[BBC Two]], and a second series has been commissioned. Each half-hour episode is a self-contained story with new characters and a new setting, and all-star at least one (usually both) of Pemberton and Shearsmith. Aside from the writers, each episode has a new cast, allowing ''Inside No. 9'' to attract a number of well-known actors. The stories are linked only by the fact that each takes place at a number 9, whether this is a suburban house, a gothic mansion or a dressing room. Pemberton and Shearsmith took inspiration for ''Inside No. 9'' from an episode of ''[[Psychoville]]'', a previous project, which was filmed in a single room. This episode was, in turn, inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. ''Inside No. 9'' was also a reaction to ''Psychoville'', which featured a long overarching story realised over multiple series.

The first series of ''Inside No. 9'' was made up of six episodes. Themes and tone varied from episode-to-episode, but all had elements of comedy and horror. "[[Sardines (Inside No. 9)|Sardines]]" concerns a game of [[sardines (game)|sardines]] at an [[engagement party]]. "[[A Quiet Night In]]", an episode almost entirely free of dialogue, follows a pair of hapless burglars breaking into a modernist house. In "[[Tom & Gerri]]", an aspiring novelist invites a homeless man into his flat. "[[Last Gasp (Inside No. 9)|Last Gasp]]" sees a popstar die while blowing up a balloon on a poorly girl's birthday. In "[[The Understudy (Inside No. 9)|The Understudy]]", an [[understudy]] in a West End production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' longs for the lead role. The series's final episode was "[[The Harrowing (Inside No. 9)|The Harrowing]]", a [[gothic horror]] story in which a schoolgirl housesits a mansion belonging to a brother and sister. An online-only episode composed of [[cinemagraphs]], "The Inventors", was also released by the BBC, but was not written by Pemberton and Shearsmith.

''Inside No. 9'' as a whole was very well received by critics, who praised the humour and creativity of the scripts, as well as the acting talent of the featured actors. The programme was variously described as "never less-than-captivating"<ref name="never less"/> and "consistently compelling".<ref name="HarrowingDessau"/> In addition, ''Inside No. 9'' won the Sketch and Comedy prize at the 35th annual [[Banff World Media Festival Rockie Awards]], and was nominated for the Best TV Sitcom prize at the 2014 [[Freesat]] Awards. However, sympathetic critics suggested that the programme may be an [[acquired taste]]; despite generally high acclaim, some journalists were highly critical of ''Inside No. 9'', and the viewing figures were comparatively low. The first series was released on DVD on 17 March 2014.

==Production and development==
In 2012, after the cancellation of their ''[[Psychoville]]'', writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith were commissioned to produce two series for the BBC by controllers [[Janice Hadlow]] and [[Cheryl Taylor]], partially in response to [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] beginning to produce comedy. At the time, it was unclear whether this would be two series of ''Inside No. 9'', then known by the [[working title]] ''Happy Endings'', or a series of ''Inside No. 9'' and a series of some other programme.<ref name="Happy Endings">{{cite news|title=Psychoville duo create Happy Endings for BBC2|url= http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/psychoville-duo-create-happy-endings-for-bbc2/5046093.article#|author=Kanter, Jake|newspaper= [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date= 6 September 2012|accessdate= 22 April 2014}} {{subscription needed}}</ref> ''Inside No. 9'' was to be produced by a BBC team,<ref name="Happy Endings"/> which was later revealed to be [[David Kerr (director)|David Kerr]] (director), [[Jon Plowman]] (executive producer) and [[Adam Tandy]] (producer).<ref name="Broadcast"/> The BBC ordered a second series of ''Inside No. 9'' before the first episode had aired.<ref name="SimonSardines">{{cite news|title= Inside No.9 will be another hit for black comedy masters Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton|url= http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-previews/what-time-inside-no-9-3111536#ixzz2saAaSiEB|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|author=Simon, Jane|date= 5 February 2014|accessdate= 6 February 2014}}</ref>

Pemberton and Shearsmith took inspiration for ''Inside No. 9'' from "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of ''Psychoville'', which was in turn inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''. This episode took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots.<ref name="Independent"/> At the same time, the concept of ''Inside No. 9'' was a "reaction" to ''Psychoville'', with Shearsmith saying that the two of them had "been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week."<ref name="Broadcast">{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9, BBC2|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/inside-no-9-bbc2/5059391.article|newspaper= [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|date= 22 August 2013|accessdate= 6 February 2014}} {{subscription needed}}</ref> Elsewhere, Shearsmith explained that the pair returned to writing [[macabre]] stories as they "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [they] write something that's purely comedic, [as] it just feels too frivolous and light".<ref name="Hull">{{cite news|title= Inside No.9 on BBC2: Hull-born master of the macabre Reece Shearsmith and partner Steve Pemberton back with tales of the unexpected|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Inside-9-BBC2-Hull-born-master-macabre-Reece/story-20538757-detail/story.html#ixzz2sa7sloIS|date=4 February 2014|newspaper= [[Hull Daily Mail]]|accessdate= 6 February 2014}}</ref> During the filming ''Inside No. 9'', Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on the programme, saying that "[b]eing in the middle of filming a third series of ''Psychoville'' would be utterly depressing".<ref name="Broadcast"/> Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience with ''Inside No. 9'' than they had experienced with ''Psychoville'', describing "Sardines", ''Inside No. 9''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first episode, by saying that it was "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story."<ref name="Broadcast"/>

The [[anthology series]] is currently a rare genre for British television programmes. Previous horror anthologies include ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''; while these would sometimes utilise comedic elements, they are more prominent in ''Inside No. 9''. ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]'' followed a similar format, but was far more comedic than horrific. Other anthology-like series on British television include ''[[Seven of One]]'' and ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'', though these programmes lacked horror elements, and, unlike ''Inside No. 9'', served as [[pilot episode|pilots]] for potential series.<ref name="Guardian"/> For Pemberton, the 1970s and 1980s were "full of" anthology shows; other examples included ''[[Play for Today]]'', ''[[Beasts (TV series)|Beasts]]'' and ''[[Armchair Thriller]]''.<ref name="radio">{{cite web|title= Reece Shearsmith speaks to Mark Radcliffe|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rpc25|work= [[Radcliffe & Maconie]]|publisher= [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]|date=4 February 2014|accessdate= 5 July 2014}}</ref> More recently, anthologies have become less popular with television executives. According to journalist and broadcaster [[Mark Lawson]], this is because anthologies can fail to motivate viewers to stay with a series, and, further, new sets and casts must be paid for each episode, meaning that a six-part anthology series will generally be more expensive than a six-part series in a more standard format. For Lawson, ''Inside No. 9'' was able to overcome these problems through the "pleasing coherence" offered by the fact each episode was set in a number 9, and "the wit and inventiveness" of the opening episodes, which could sufficiently engage viewers.<ref name="Guardian"/>

Inspiration and production varied from installment to installment, and each was filmed separately, taking less than a week per episode.<ref name="radio"/> After Shearsmith and Pemberton had decided that each episode would be about confinement, and having written some of the later episodes, they were inspired by a wardrobe in their working space for "Sardines". The writers were keen to see how confined they could make the characters,<ref>{{cite web|title= Inside the wardrobe|publisher=BBC|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rty04|date= 6 February 2014|accessdate= 25 April 2014}}</ref> aiming to induce feelings of [[claustrophobia]] in viewers.<ref name="Hull"/> The anthology format allowed Pemberton and Shearsmith to revisit prior ideas, which is what they did with "A Quiet Night In" and "Tom & Gerri". The former was inspired by the writers' efforts to include a long segment without dialogue in an episode of ''Psychoville''. Both episodes followed break-ins.<ref>{{cite web|title= Why did you do a silent episode?|publisher=BBC|date= 12 February 2014|accessdate= 13 February 2014|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01s4vxy}}</ref> The [[Pinteresque]] "Tom & Gerri" was based upon a play written by Pemberton and Shearsmith while the pair were living together and [[job seeking]]. The setting was based upon their own flat, while the character Tom's development evoked the experience of job-hunting.<ref>{{cite news|title= What was the inspiration for Tom & Gerri?|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sk9mp|publisher= BBC|date= 19 February 2014|accessdate= 20 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="hands down"/> "Last Gasp" was inspired by a person Pemberton had seen on ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]'' who collected jars of air, as well as the [[death of Michael Jackson]] and the [[death of Amy Winehouse]].<ref>{{cite web|title= A My Family episode gone wrong|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01sxf7t|date= 26 February 2014|accessdate= 1 February 2014|publisher=BBC}}</ref> "The Understudy", the plot of which is partially based upon and concerns ''[[Macbeth]]'', took longer to write than any other episode; the writers rewrote the script several times, as they were unsure of whether the characters should be amateur or professional actors.<ref name="www.bbc.co.uk p01tbhw4">{{cite web|title= A backstage Macbeth|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01tbhw4|publisher= BBC|date= 5 March 2014|accessdate= 10 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="www.bbc.co.uk p01tbhw4"/> "The Harrowing" was the writers' attempt to produce a gothic horror episode.

As each episode of ''Inside No. 9'' features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series.<ref name="Independent"/> The writers' reputation also helped attract writers, with journalist David Chater saying that they "have developed such a track record over the years that many of the finest actors in the country jump at the chance to appear in their dark imaginings".<ref>{{cite news|title=Viewing guide|author=Chater, David|newspaper= T2, [[The Times]]|pages=12<U+2013>3|date= 5 March 2014}}</ref> Though Pemberton and Shearsmith generally starred in each episode, they did not necessarily take on the main roles. Shearsmith explained this by saying that they "didn't write this for us to be in. We wrote the stories first then thought, could we be in them?"<ref name="Independent"/>

Many critics responded very positively to ''Inside No. 9''. After the final episode, comedic critic [[Bruce Dessau]] said on his website that the series "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world."<ref name="HarrowingDessau"/> On the same day, David Chater, writing in ''[[The Times]]'', said of the series as a whole that "[i]t's hard to know which to admire more&nbsp;<U+2013> the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life."<ref>{{cite news|title= Viewing guide|author= Chater, David|newspaper= T2, [[The Times]]|date= 12 March 2014|pages=12<U+2013>3}}</ref> Chater had previously described "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of ''Inside No. 9'', as "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as long as I can remember&nbsp;<U+2013> one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears".<ref name="ChaterQuiet">{{cite news|author=Chater, David|title= Viewing guide|newspaper= T2, [[The Times]]|date= 12 February 2014|pages=12<U+2013>3}}</ref> Mark Jones (''[[The Guardian]]'') considered the whole series, saying that the ''Inside No. 9'' was "never less-than-captivating",<ref name="never less">{{cite news|title= Television: Wednesday 12|author= Arnold, Ben; Robinson, John; Stubbs, David; Catterall, Ali; Jones, Mark; Verdier, Hannah; Davies, Hannah J.; Bakare, Lanre|newspaper= The Guide, [[The Guardian]]|page= 64|date= 8 March 2014}}</ref> while a review in the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' described every episode as "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though it was felt that the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three.<ref>{{cite news|title= Every episode was intriguing and&nbsp;... |newspaper= [[Liverpool Echo]]|date=15 March 2014|page=20}}</ref>

Writing before ''Inside No. 9'' was televised, broadcaster and journalist [[Mark Lawson]] suggested that, among anthology series, the programme possessed "the potential to be remembered as a singular achievement".<ref name="Guardian"/> Commending both the acting and writing of ''Inside No. 9'', ''[[New Statesman]]'' television critic [[Rachel Cooke]] offered a positive verdict of the programme after seeing the first half of the series. Cooke expressed particular admiration of Pemberton and Shearsmith's ability to squeeze "perfectly formed narratives{{spaced ndash}} characters with proper backstories, scenarios that are complicated and unwind relatively slowly{{spaced ndash}} into just 30 minutes".<ref name="Cooke">{{cite journal|title= Precision made|author=[[Rachel Cooke|Cooke, Rachel]]|journal=[[New Statesman]]|date=21 February 2014|volume=143|issue=7|page=55}}</ref> Also writing mid-series, journalist Gareth Lightfoot called ''Inside No. 9'' "hands down the best, freshest thing on [television] at the moment" in the ''[[Evening Gazette (Teesside)|Evening Gazette]]'', though he doubted whether it could truly be considered comedy.<ref name="hands down">{{cite news|title= Don't make me laugh|newspaper= [[Evening Gazette (Teesside)|Evening Gazette]]|date= 22 February 2014|author= Lightfoot, Gareth|page=21}}</ref>

[[Donal Lynch]], of Irish newspaper the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', suggested that, like the previous work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, ''Inside No. 9'' may be something of "a cult hit/acquired taste".<ref>{{cite news|title= TV of the week; Appointment to View with Donal Lynch|author= [[Donal Lynch|Lynch, Donal]]|newspaper= Living, [[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date= 9 March 2014|page=36}}</ref> Barry Didcock, of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', expressed a similar sentiment, calling ''Inside No. 9'' "probably the most Marmitey programme on television".<ref>{{cite news|title= Police line far from straight|author= Didcock, Barry|newspaper= [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date= 5 March 2014|page= 21}}</ref> ''The Times'' published a response to a complaint received from a viewer, who was unhappy with Chater's positive reviews of ''Inside No. 9'', suggesting that "A Quiet Night Night In" was more traumatic than humorous.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/feedback/article4005992.ece|title= Why it has been all quiet on the royal front |author=Wild, Rose|date= 15 February 2014|accessdate= 21 February 2014|newspaper= [[The Times]]}} {{subscription needed}}</ref> Some tabloid columnists also expressed dissatisfaction with the programme. Virginia Blackburn, of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', wrote a highly critical review of "Last Gasp". Blackburn considered ''Inside No. 9'' an example of the weakness of contemporary television comedy, saying that the episode is "not funny, it's not clever and is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else".<ref name="Blackburn">{{cite news|author= Blackburn, Virginia|title= It's 'humour' for juveniles|newspaper= [[Daily Express]]|date= 27 February 2014|page= 49}}</ref> Another journalist unimpressed was the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' columnist Kevin O'Sullivan, who dismissed the programme by saying simply "BBC2's alleged comedy Inside No. 9: didn't even smile".<ref>{{Cite news|title= TV dross&nbsp;... |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date= 9 February 2014|author=O'Sullivan, Kevin|page= 35}}</ref>

Cooke observed the difficulty in reviewing ''Inside No. 9'' as a whole due to the fact that each episode is different from the last.<ref name="Cooke"/> "Sardines" was commended for its cast and acting,<ref name="SimonSardines"/><ref name="KendallSardines">{{cite news|author=Kendall, Paul|title= Inside No9, BBC Two, review|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 February 2014|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10620378/Inside-No9-BBC-Two-review.html|accessdate= 6 February 2014}} {{subscription needed}}</ref><ref name="OwenSardines">{{cite news|title= Inside No 9: Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton unnerve viewers|url= http://tv.uk.msn.com/what-to-watch/inside-no-9-reece-shearsmith-and-steve-pemberton-unnerve-viewers|publisher= [[MSN]]|author= Owen, Dan|date= 29 January 2014|accessdate= 7 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="TimesSardines">{{cite news|title= Pick of the Day; Wednesday 5; Inside No 9 BBC Two, 10pm|newspaper= Saturday Review.
