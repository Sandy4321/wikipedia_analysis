'''New York State Route 83''' (NY 83) is a [[state route]] located entirely in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[New York]].  It extends from an intersection with [[U.S. Route 62 (New York)|U.S. Route 62]] in the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Conewango Valley, New York|Conewango Valley]] (at the [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]] border) to [[New York State Route 60|NY 60]] in the hamlet of [[Laona, New York|Laona]], near [[Fredonia, New York|Fredonia]]. Along the way, NY 83 intersects with [[New York State Route 322|NY 322]] at Balcom Corners and serves the village of [[Cherry Creek (village), New York|Cherry Creek]].

NY 83 initially extended south to [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]] when it was assigned as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]. The portion of the route between Frewsburg and Conewango Valley became part of US 62 by 1935, resulting in the truncation of NY 83 to its current southern terminus by 1938.

==Route description==
[[Image:8385.JPG|thumb|right|These signposts in [[Arkwright, New York|Arkwright]] show [[County Route 85 (Chautauqua County, New York)|County Route 85]] running concurrently with NY 83.]]
NY 83 begins at [[U.S. Route 62 (New York)|U.S. Route 62]] (US 62) in the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Conewango Valley, New York|Conewango Valley]], located in the northeastern corner of the town of [[Ellington, New York|Ellington]]. The route heads north-northwestward, paralleling a pair of train tracks, and shortly after enters the village of [[Cherry Creek (village), New York|Cherry Creek]], where it intersects County Route 70 and County Route 68, respectively. Known as ''Main Street'', it bows out to the east slightly, and subsequently takes on a due north path as it heads through the town of [[Cherry Creek (town), New York|Cherry Creek]]. A couple miles later, it reaches the hamlet of [[Balcom Corners, New York|Balcom Corners]] (located in the town of [[Villenova, New York|Villenova]]), a community situated at the junction of NY 83 and the western terminus of [[New York State Route 322|NY 322]]. Here, NY 83 turns westward toward the community of [[Hamlet, New York|Hamlet]], where it intersects with CR 72.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Google Maps|title=''Overview of NY 83''|publisher=[Map]|accessdate=2008-05-03|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=from:+RT-83%20@42.242190,%20-79.062400+to:+RT-83%20@42.388149,%20-79.168314}}</ref> 

NY 83 begins a more erratic routing, passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as it enters the town of [[Arkwright, New York|Arkwright]]. For a short distance it is concurrent with CR 85, and takes on the name ''Black Corner Street'', so named because it is located within the hamlet of [[Black Corners, New York|Black Corners]].<ref name=google /> Although this portion of NY 83 is cosigned with CR 85, it is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |title=Forestville Quadrangle - New York - Chautauqua Co. |year=1978 |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=u5 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref> An intersection with CR 79 is not far off, as it passes just north of the town of [[Arkwright, New York|Arkwright]]. NY 83 proceeds west-northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at [[New York State Route 60|NY 60]] in the community of [[Laona, New York|Laona]], located just west of the Arkwright town line in [[Pomfret, New York|Pomfret]].<ref name=google>{{Cite web|author=Google Maps|title=''Overview of NY 83 (2)''|publisher=[Map]|accessdate=2008-05-02|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=from:+RT-83%20@42.388149,%20-79.168314+to:+RT-83%20@42.413378,%20-79.304593}}</ref>

==History and current developments==
NY 83 was assigned as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]] to an alignment extending from [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]] in the south to [[Laona, New York|Laona]] in the north.<ref name=gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> By 1935, [[U.S. Route 62 (New York)|U.S. Route 62]] was extended into [[New York]], [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ping NY 83 from Frewsburg to [[Conewango Valley, New York|Conewango Valley]].<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> The overlap was eliminated by 1938, truncating NY 83 to its present length.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Road Map for 1938 |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1938 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> The route is slated to apply treatments to the pavement along NY 83 in Pomfret, Arkwright and Villenova. The project is to be auctioned on by contractors in spring 2009 and construction is to start that summer, and will likely cost $1.6 million (2008 USD).<ref name="future">{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/pls/portal/MEXIS_APP.WEPIDYNPAGEMULTI.show?p_arg_names=p_pin&p_arg_values=5V0923|title=VPP-RT 83; RT 60 TO HAMLET|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-12-11|date=2008}}</ref>
