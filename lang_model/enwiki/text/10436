'''George Balmer''', the son of a [[House painter and decorator|house-painter]], was born at [[North Shields]] about 1806. He was brought up as a decorator, and, while young, practised at [[Edinburgh]]. Always fond of art, he found time to contribute to an Exhibition of Water-Colour Drawings in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1831, and afterwards assisted [[John Wilson Carmichael|W. J. Carmichael]] in painting the large picture, 'The Heroic Exploit of Admiral Collingwood at Trafalgar,' now in the Trinity House at Newcastle. Soon afterwards, Balmer visited Holland, the Rhine, and Switzerland, staying on his way home at Paris, where he studied the masterpieces in the [[Louvre]]. On his return he settled in London, and for several years exhibited pictures of the Rhine, coast scenes, and moonlight views. In 1836 he suggested to the [[William Finden|Findens]] the publication of a work on 'The Ports and Harbours of Great Britain,' for which he made many drawings. Soon after he came into property, and in 1842 retired to Ravensworth, in the [[County Durham|county of Durham]], where he died in the prime of life in April, 1846.
