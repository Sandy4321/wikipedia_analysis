The '''Rolls-Royce Falcon''' is an [[aircraft engine|aero-engine]] developed in 1915. It was a smaller version of the [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]]; a liquid cooled V-12 of 867 [[Cubic inch|cu in]] (14.2 [[Litre|L]]) [[Engine displacement|capacity]]. Fitted to many British [[World War I]] era aircraft, production ceased in 1927.

An airworthy Falcon survives today and powers a [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] during summer displays.

==Design and development==
Production of the Falcon began in September 1916 and was so successful that it was also manufactured under licence by [[Straker-Squire|Brazil Straker]] in Bristol.<ref>Pugh 2001, p.82.</ref> Production continued until 1927, by which time 2,185 had been built.<ref name = "Lumsden p.188">Lumsden 2003, p.188.</ref>

An unusual feature of this engine is the [[Epicyclic gearing|epicyclic]] propeller reduction gear which contains a [[clutch]] designed to limit the maximum [[torque]], thus protecting the reduction gears.<ref name="Guttery 1969, p.27">Guttery 1969, p.27.</ref>

The Falcon was notably used in the [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]] and [[Blackburn Kangaroo]] bomber.

==Variants==
''Note:''<ref>Alternate designations in italics.</ref>
;Falcon I (''Rolls-Royce 190 hp Mk I'')
:(1916-17), 230 hp, 250 engines produced in both left and right hand tractor versions.
;Falcon II (''Rolls-Royce 190 hp Mk II'')
:(1917), 253 hp, [[Carburetor|carburettor]] size increased. 250 built at Derby.
;Falcon III (''Rolls-Royce 190 hp Mk III'')
:(1917-1927), 285 hp, increased [[compression ratio]] (5.3:1), twin carburettors replaced with four Rolls-Royce/[[Claudel-Hobson]] units. 1,685 built at Derby.
