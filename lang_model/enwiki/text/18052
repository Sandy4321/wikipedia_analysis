Starting his career in the [[Government of Pakistan|government]], Mirza was employed by [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] in the [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]], being appointed as the first [[Defence Secretary of Pakistan|Defence Secretary]] (one of an apex [[Pakistan Civil Services|bureaucratic post]]), overseeing the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1947|Indo-Pakistan war of 1947]], and the [[Balochistan conflict]] in 1948.<ref name="Electronic Government of Pakistan"/> Serious disorder and civil unrest sparked in [[East Pakistan]] as a result of the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in 1952, prompting Prime minister [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] to appoint him as the Governor of the province. He oversaw the success of the [[One Unit|One Unit programme]] in East Pakistan in 1954, and succeeded [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Malik Ghulam]] as the Governor-General in 1955. After successfully promulgating the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|1956 constitution]], Mirza became the first president. But his presidency saw great political instability, challenges in [[Foreign policy of Pakistan|foreign policy]], and the ousture of four prime ministers in two years. He finally imposed [[1958 Pakistani coup d'<U+00E9>tat|martial law]] in 1958 after suspending the constitution and dissolving democratic institutions, including the [[Pakistan Parliament]]. Mirza has the distinction of being the first to bring in military influence in [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]] after he appointed his army chief as chief martial law administrator of the country.

Problems with the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] and the [[Establishment (Pakistan)|establishment]] escalated after [[Pakistan-United States relations|relations]] with the [[United States]] deteriorated. Imposition of martial law only led to more civil unrest and political challenges, and also undermined Mirza's own position. After only twenty days of martial law, Mirza was forced out of the presidency by his [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]] Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]]. He was exiled to [[London]], where he resided until his death. When he died in 1969 after a long illness, President [[Yahya Khan]] denied him a burial in Pakistan. Out of respect, the [[Shah of Iran|Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] gave him a state funeral in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

===Defence Secretary===

Upon the [[Creation of Pakistan|establishment]] of [[Pakistan]], Mirza was one of the highest-senior ranking government officer in the nation.<ref name="The Story of Pakistan (Iskandar's life)"/> As Defense Secretary, Mirza oversaw the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947 war]] with India, as well as the [[Balochistan conflict]]. In 1950, Prime minister Ali Khan approved the recommendation of his appointment as honorary active duty Major-General in [[Pakistan Army]], commanding the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police|Military Police]] as its second [[General Officer Commanding]]. In 1951, Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan appointed him as the director of the Department of Kashmir and Afghanistan Affairs (DKA). His tenure also saw the redeployment of Military Police in East-Pakistan as a result of the [[Bengali Language Movement]], during which the [[East Pakistan Rifles|East Pakistan Army]] fatally shot four student activists. Within a short span of time, the Military Police had the control of the state and its officer commanding submitted the report of their course of action to Major-General Iskandar Mirza in 1954.

===Governor of East-Pakistan===

Mizra's rapid control of the province brought him to national prominence, leading to national recognition.<ref name="The Story of Pakistan (Iskandar's life)">{{cite web|last=Story of Pakistan|title=Iskander Mirza|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P015|work=Story of Pakistan Press Directorate|publisher=The Story of Pakistan (Iskandar's life)|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> Upon the dismissal of [[Bangladesh Awami League|United Front]], Governor-General [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad]] decided to declare governor's rule in the state, with the incoming Prime minister asked to appoint a governor.

Mirza was an outspoken supporter of the [[One Unit|"''One Unit Programme''"]]<U+2014> a programme of integrating the nations of West-Pakistan and East Pakistan's Bengali nation into one single nation.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Mirza became Governor-General)"/> This programme was a quiet a success in [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistan]], but met with harsh criticism led by the [[Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement|nationalists movements]].<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Mirza became Governor-General)"/> While he forcefully integrated West Pakistan into one province, this led the West Pakistani population to fiercely oppose his schemes.<ref name="The Story of Pakistan (Iskandar's life)"/>  The pressure from both West and East Pakistan forced him to held new general elections where the Awami Party came to power under the founding fathers of Pakistan.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Mirza became Governor-General)"/>

===Martial Law===

The Awami League began negotiating a power sharing programme with the Muslim League, re-organizing after the 1954 elections. This attempt of the Awami League threatened Mirza and his political influence nearly bringing the Muslim League to come to its end. Therefore, on 7 October 1958, Mirza issued an executive decree and a state presidential proclamation abrogating the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Martial Law)">{{cite web|last=Story of Pakistan|title=Martial Law|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A065|publisher=Story of Pakistan (Martial Law)|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>  The [[Pakistan Parliament]], [[:Category:Provincial Assemblies of Pakistan|provisional assemblies]] were dissolved, and the [[Government of Pakistan|civil government]] of Awami League was brought to end.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Martial Law)"/>

On 7 October, Mizra appeared on [[Radio Pakistan|national radio]] declaring that he was introducing a new constitution; "more suited to the genius of the Pakistan nation",<ref name="Dr. Professor Mubashir Hassan, professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Engineering and Technology and the Oxford University Press"/> on November 1958, as he believed democracy was unsuited to Pakistan "with its 15% literacy rate".<ref name="Dr. Professor Mubashir Hassan, professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Engineering and Technology and the Oxford University Press">{{cite book|last=Hassan PhD (Civil Engineering)|first=Dr. Professsor Mubashir|title=The Mirage of Power|year=2000|publisher=Dr. Professor Mubashir Hassan, professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Engineering and Technology and the Oxford University Press|location=ford University, United Kingdom|isbn=0-19-579300-5|pages=394}}</ref>  In 1958, Mirza took the nation into confidence, saying that:

President Mirza and his Army Commander General Ayub Khan had began the new era with apparent unanimity, jointly describing it as a two-man dictatorial regime evolved under the "''Establishment''", and the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Ouster of President (Iskander Mirza Part-I)">{{cite web|last=Story of Pakistan|title=Ouster of President Iskander Mirza|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A117|work=Story of Pakistan|publisher=Story of Pakistan (Ouster of President (Iskander Mirza Part-I)|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>  However, the two had very different views on dealing with the new situation, even though they were responsible for bringing about the change.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Ouster of President (Iskander Mirza Part-I)"/>

After his death, President [[Yahya Khan]]<U+2014> Ayub Khan's successor<U+2014> and his military government refused to allow him to be buried in his own country, and his body was flown to [[Tehran]] where, out of respect, [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] gave him a [[State Funeral]] where the hundreds of [[Pakistanis in Iran|Pakistan community]] in Iran bade farewell and offered their prayers.<ref name="Jang Publications"/>

===Family===

Mirza was married twice: his first marriage took place on 24 November 1922 when he married a Bengali woman, Rifa'at Begum (1907&ndash;23 March 1967). The couple had two sons and four daughters.<ref name="Times of India">{{cite news|last=Kabita Chowdhury|title=First Pakistan president's Bengal home in a shambles|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-29/kolkata/30568408_1_house-national-property-pratibha-patil|accessdate=3 February 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=29 Dec 2011<!--, 04.54AM IST-->}}</ref>

In October 1954, while in West Pakistan, Mirza's second marriage took place in Karachi after he fell in love with [[Iranians in Pakistan|Iranian-Pakistan]] woman Mrs. Naheed Begum (1914&ndash;).  Naheed Begum was a close friend of Begum [[Nusrat Bhutto]] who she knew during her college years.<ref name="ZAB calls Iskander Mirza"/> It was this friendship that brought Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto into the political arena of Pakistan.<ref name="ZAB calls Iskander Mirza"/> During martial law, President Mirza took his Army Commander General Ayub Khan to Bhutto's residence in Karachi, where he introduced Bhutto to Ayub Khan who kept Bhutto in his cabinet after ousting Mirza.<ref name="ZAB calls Iskander Mirza"/>

Mirza's family palace in [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistan]] is in Pakistan, where it is a major tourist attraction, many of Mirza's descendants often visit here.

==Legacy==

Iskander Ali Mirza is often criticized for introducing military martial law.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Historians noted that Mirza held that Pakistanis "widely lacked the parliamentary spirit and  because of the lack of training in the field of democracy and the low literacy rate amongst the masses, democratic institutions cannot flourish in Pakistan".<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Mirza wanted to have more "control in [[Democracy in Pakistan|democracy in]] [[Pakistan]]", believing that the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Judicial authorities]] should be given the same powers which they used to enjoy during the British Indian Empire.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/>

Mizra's political ideology reflected [[Secularism in Pakistan|secularism]], and an image of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], strongly advocating the [[Separation of religion and state|religious separation in]] state matters.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Mirza had never had a high opinion of politicians, believing that politicians should have the right to make policy but that they should not interfere in the administration.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Historians also asserted that Mirza's role as the [[head of state]] led him to play an active part in power politics, building an image of being a [[kingmaker]] in the country's politics.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Mirza took full advantage of the weakness of politicians and played them against each other, first offsetting the influence of the Muslim League by creating the Republican Party.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/>

During his short span of four years as the head of state, four Prime Ministers were changed, three of them were his appointees, while the only popularly elected Bengali prime minister was dismissed. Iskander Mirza is thus widely held responsible for the instability that brought the active role of Pakistan Armed Forces in politics.<ref name="Story of Pakistan (Part-I)"/> Despite this criticism, Mirza remained widely respected; Mirza was also given a state honor by then-[[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], who called him the "greatest Bengali leader" of Pakistan.<ref name="ZAB calls Iskander Mirza">{{cite web|last=Administration Post|title=ZAB calls Iskander Mirza <U+2018>Greater Than Jinnah<U+2019>|url=http://talkhaba.com/2011/06/iskander-mirza-was-greater-than-muhammad-ali-jinnah-z-a-bhutto-asserts.html|publisher=Indian Press News|accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>
