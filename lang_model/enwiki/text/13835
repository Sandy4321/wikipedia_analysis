'''Martin Pierre Brodeur''' ({{IPA2|m<U+0251><U+0281><U+02C8>t<U+1EBD> b<U+0281>o<U+02C8>d<U+0153><U+0281>}}) (born [[May 6]], [[1972]], in [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]], [[Quebec]]) is a professional [[ice hockey]] goaltender who has played his entire [[National Hockey League]] career with the [[New Jersey Devils]]. In his 13-year tenure, he has led the team to three Stanley Cup championships and has taken them to the playoffs all but once. In addition to holding over thirty Devils franchise records, he is on pace to surpass [[Patrick Roy]]'s career records for wins,<ref name="wins">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/r&rW.shtml|title=NHL Wins (Goalies)|accessdate=2006-12-05|year=2006|publisher=HHof.com}}</ref> games played and minutes played, as well as [[Terry Sawchuk]]'s record for career shutouts,<ref name="shutouts">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/r&rSO.shtml|title=NHL Shutouts|accessdate=2006-12-05|year=2006|publisher=HHof.com}}</ref>
and [[Patrick Roy]]'s record for career playoff shutouts.

Brodeur has been among the NHL's most consistent goaltenders over the past decade, winning at least 35 games each of the last ten seasons as well as being the only goalie in NHL history with six 40-win seasons.  He is a two-time [[Vezina Trophy]] winner, a four-time [[Jennings Trophy]] winner, a nine-time [[NHL All-Star Team|NHL All Star]], and one of only two NHL goaltenders to have scored goals in the regular season and the playoffs. In the current [[2006-07 NHL season]], Brodeur surpassed Sawchuk and [[Ed Belfour]] on the all-time wins list and [[Glenn Hall]] on the all-time shutouts list to rank 2nd and 3rd in those categories, respectively. He also passed [[Bernie Parent]]'s record of 47 single-season wins with his 48th win on [[April 5]], [[2007]].

Brodeur is considered a hybrid style goalie, which differs from the typical [[butterfly style]] of his native Quebec. He is best known for his great reflexes, especially with his glove hand, his puck handling, and his strong positional play.<ref name="MainBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeygoalies.org/bio/brodeurm.html|title=Martin Brodeur Biography|publisher=hockeygoalies.org|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref>

==Early life==
Brodeur's success followed his father [[Denis Brodeur|Denis]], who was considered an outstanding goaltender.<ref name="HHOFjournal">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/HTML/exSCJ_33.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journal|accessdate=2006-12-01|date=[[August 22]], [[2003]]|publisher=HHof.com}}</ref> He played in the [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956 Olympics]] for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]], where he helped them win a bronze medal.<ref name="Olympics">{{cite web|author=Allen, Kevin.|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/torino/2006-01-29-brodeur_x.htm|title=Brodeur following in father's mask|date=[[January 29]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-12-01|year=2006|publisher=USA Today}}</ref> After his playing career was over, Denis was a longtime photographer for the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. For more than 20 years, he attended all Montreal games and practises, and when Martin was old enough he came along. Martin dreamed of playing for the Canadiens, and he idolized their goaltender [[Patrick Roy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Wigge, Larry.|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_23_225/ai_75434961|title=Q&A - hockey players Patrick Roy and Martin Brodeur - Brief Article - Interview|date=[[June 4]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2007-04-27|year=2001|publisher=Sporting Times}}</ref>

However, Martin did not start out as a goalie himself, but rather, as a forward. His goaltending career began when his coach asked him if he wanted to play as a backup at the position in a youth tournament. Martin explained:<ref name="GoalieDecision">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinbrodeur.net/index.php?lng=en&vyber=fakty|title=Martin Brodeur - Facts|publisher=MartinBrodeur.net|accessdate=2007-04-06|year=2007}}</ref>
{{cquote|The next season my coach came up to me and said, 'Do you want to be a goalie or forward this year?' It was the biggest decision of my life, and I was seven years old. I don't know why I decided, but I thought it would be fun to play goal.}}
Brodeur's play in goal soon got him noticed by fans and scouts.<ref name="Scouts">{{cite web|url=http://ca.askmen.com/men/sports_60/86c_martin_brodeur.html|title=Martin Brodeur|publisher=AskMen.com|accessdate=2007-04-07|year=2005}}</ref> In 1990 he made it to the [[QMJHL|Quebec Major Junior League]], the same league that produced Roy, [[Felix Potvin]] and several other NHL goalies.  While playing with the [[Saint-Hyacinthe Laser]], he made the QMJHL All-Rookie team and the QMJHL 2nd All-Star Team in 1992. He played in the league for three years before being drafted.

==NHL career==
===1990<U+2013>1994===
Brodeur was drafted in the first round, 20th overall, from Saint-Hyacinthe, in the [[1990 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[New Jersey Devils]]. In the [[1991-92 NHL season]], he was called up to the Devils for four games during the regular-season when Devils' goaltenders [[Chris Terreri]] and [[Craig Billington]] became injured, and played in one playoff game. He spent most of the season and the entire following season with the [[Utica Devils]] of the AHL. However, in 1994 Brodeur gained recognition when he won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy|Calder Trophy]], an annual award for the best rookie in the NHL, after leading the Devils to 2nd place in the NHL and the 3rd round of the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the [[New York Rangers]] in seven games.<ref name="1994 Playoffs">{{cite web|url=http://nbpfaus.net/~pfau/nhl/1994.html|title=1994 National Hockey League Playoffs|publisher=nbpfaus.net|accessdate=2007-02-09|year=2001}}</ref> He finished 2nd in goals against average and 4th in save percentage during the regular season, helping him eventually land the starting job over Terreri.

The next season, which was shortened to forty-eight games due to a [[1994-95 NHL lockout|four month lockout]] that was focused on salary cap issues, the Devils finished tied for 9th overall, 5th in their conference, and were not considered a [[Stanley Cup]] contender. However, with the leadership of Brodeur, they defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] in the 1st round after shutting them out in three of their four wins. Brodeur had another stellar performance in the second round against [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]], where he gave up only eight goals and helped the Devils soundly defeat the Penguins in five games. In the third round the Devils defeated [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]] in six games, giving them their first Stanley Cup finals appearance in franchise history, opposite the heavily favoured [[Detroit Red Wings]]. But the strong play of Brodeur and the Devils' infamous "trap" method would make this series lopsided in favour of New Jersey, who would go on to sweep the Red Wings while holding them to only seven goals in four games. Brodeur now had a Stanley Cup in only his second full season in the NHL. After the victory, he was quoted as saying the following:<ref name="MainBio"/>

{{cquote|In the last game against Detroit, the time from ten minutes left to one minute left was probably the longest nine minutes of my life. But from one to zero was probably the greatest time I've ever had. I didn't want the clock to run out. It was such a great feeling: people crying in the stands, people jumping up and down, people cheering. Guys couldn't even sit up on the bench. It was probably the best minute of my life.}}

===1995<U+2013>1999===
After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the [[1995-96 NHL season]] and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 77 (of a possible 82) games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd most shutouts in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star game for the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]], and stopped all 12 shots he faced.<ref name="MainBio"/> He finished fourth in voting for the [[Vezina Trophy]], which is awarded to the league's top goaltender.  Brodeur also played on [[Team Canada]] during the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]], where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal match.

In the [[1996-97 NHL season|1996<U+2013>97 season]], the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL and played the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the first round of the playoffs. In the first game of the series on [[April 17]] [[1997]], with the Devils up by two goals late in the game, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5<U+2013>2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goalie had scored in the playoffs, and the 5th time overall.<ref name="GoalScored">{{cite web|url=http://www.martinbrodeur.net/index.php?lng=en&vyber=fakty|title=Martin Brodeur - Facts|publisher=MartinBrodeur.net|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref> The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers once again. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina, was named to his second all-star team, and had the lowest goals-against-average by a goalie in almost thirty years, earning him the [[Jennings Trophy]]. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save-percentage.

The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular<U+2013>season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference,<ref name="1stplace1998">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/nhl19271998.html|title=1997-98 NHL Standings|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}</ref> but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded [[Ottawa Senators]].<ref name="98playoffs">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=NHL1927&season=1998&leaguenm=NHL|title=1997-98 NHL Playoff Results|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}</ref> Once again, Brodeur made the all-star team, finished as a runner up for the Vezina, and took home the Jennings Trophy.<ref name="98Jennings">{{cite web|url=http://www.hockeynut.com/9899/awards98.html|title=1998 NHL Awards|publisher=hockeynut.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=1998}}</ref>

In the [[1998-99 NHL season|1998<U+2013>99 season]], the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, Devils lost in the first round of the playoffs yet again, this time to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].  It was by far the worst playoff performance in Brodeur's 5-year career, as he allowed 20 goals in 7 games with an .856 save percentage.<ref name="PlayoffStats">{{cite web|url=http://www2.nhl.com/nhl/app?service=page&page=PlayerDetail&playerId=8455710&tab=crst|title=Martin Brodeur - Career Stats|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=2007}}</ref>

===1999<U+2013>2003===
During the [[1999-2000 NHL season]], on [[February 15]], [[2000]], Brodeur was credited with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch the puck before [[Simon Gagne]] of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils.<ref name="2ndGoal">{{cite web|author=Bostrom, Don.|url=http://www.mcall.com/sports/columnists/all-nhlcolumnsundayfeb11,0,4691572.column?page=2&coll=all-randomcolumnistssport-misc|title=Devils' Brodeur is closing in on becoming NHL's new zero hero|publisher=mccall.com|date=[[February 11]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=2007}}</ref>  Brodeur had previously tapped the puck behind his net, stopping an attempted wrap-around by a Flyer.

That season, Brodeur won 43 games for the second time in his career, and the Devils finished with the fourth seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] after losing the division to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] by two points.<ref name="9900standings">{{cite web|url=http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/nhl19272000.html|title=1999-00 NHL Standings|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2007-03-20|year=2000}}</ref> Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the [[Florida Panthers]] in the first round, giving up only six goals in four games. In the next round against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] he recorded two shutouts, including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a commanding 3<U+2013>1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series, but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to the surprising come from behind series victory in 7 games. They went on to play the [[Dallas Stars]] in the Stanley Cup Finals, who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a 7-goal tally against Dallas, the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest of the way as he gave up only six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.<ref name="9900playoffs">{{cite web|url=http://hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/playoffdisplay.php3?league=NHL1927&season=2000&leaguenm=NHL|title=1999-00 NHL Playoffs|publisher=hockeydb.com|date=[[June 10]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2007-03-20|year=2000}}</ref>

The next year, Brodeur topped the 40-win mark for the third time in his career, despite having an average GAA and save-percentage throughout the season. He played in the All-Star Game for the 6th consecutive season, and helped the Devils earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round Brodeur recorded two shutouts against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the Devils took the series in six games. After struggling to beat 7th-seeded [[Toronto]] in seven games, the Devils had little trouble defeating the 6th-seeded [[Penguin]]s in the Eastern Conference Finals, where Brodeur added two more shutouts, both on the road. In their second straight [[Stanley Cup]] finals appearance, the Devils played a back-and-forth series against the top seeded [[Colorado Avalanche]]. But with a 3<U+2013>2 series lead and a game at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] to close out the series, a lack of offense, unnecessary penalties and mediocre play from Brodeur combined to lead to two consecutive losses and a Colorado Stanley Cup victory in seven games.<ref name="2001finals1">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/recaps/2001/06/07/njd_col|title=Game 6 recap|publisher=CNN SI|date=[[June 08]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2007-03-20|year=2001}}</ref><ref name="2001finals2">{{cite web|author=''Associated Press''|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/2001/playoffs/news/2001/06/10/devils_folo_ap|title=Devils fall one game short in repeat quest|publisher=CNN SI|date=[[June 10]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2007-03-20|year=2001}}</ref>

In the [[2001-02 NHL season]], Brodeur finished among the league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued to lead the league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. The next year, in [[2002-03 NHL season|2002-03]], Brodeur finally achieved what had been eluding him his whole career: the [[Vezina Trophy]].<ref name="Vezina">{{cite web|author=Roarke, Shawn P.|url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/trophies/brodeur_vezina061203.html|title=At long last, the Vezina|publisher=NHL.com|date=[[June 12]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2007-03-03|year=2003}}</ref> He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] finalist for the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named a 1st Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. With one of the most impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after dramatic seven-game series wins against the top-seeded [[Ottawa Senators]] and the surprising 7th-seeded [[Anaheim Mighty Ducks]].

[[Image:Brodeur in stance.jpg|thumb|200px|Brodeur readies himself for action during a game in 2007.]]
In the [[2003-04 NHL season]], Brodeur won his second consecutive Vezina Trophy and Jennings trophy. He was also a first Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and a finalist for the [[Hart Trophy]] again. The Devils lost the [[Atlantic Division]] title by 1 point to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], who had obtained the 3-seed and home ice advantage against the sixth seeded Devils in the first round of the playoffs. This would be too much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.

After the lockout canceled the [[2004-05 NHL season]], Brodeur signed a contract extension with the Devils on [[January 27]], [[2006]] that will pay him $31.2 million over six years. In the [[2005-06 NHL season]] he posted 43 wins, adding on to his NHL records of what was now five 40-win seasons and ten consecutive 30-win seasons.<ref name="30and10">{{cite web|author=''[[Associated Press]]''|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/teams/news_story/?ID=157193&hubname=nhl-devils|title=Brodeur sets goaltending mark in Devils win|date=[[March 4]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=TSN|year=2006}}</ref> After struggling early in the season, his impressive play later on made him a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the third straight year,<ref name="Vezina0506">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2006/05/271296.html|title=NHL Announces 2005-06 Trophy finalists|publisher=NHL.com|date=[[May 4]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-05|year=2006}}</ref> and helped lead the Devils to a surprising comeback in the last two months of the season that resulted in them winning the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] in the final game of the year.<ref name="Atlantic2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20060419T023023461&newsgroup=ap.sportsml.columnist.article&sports=ice-hockey&team=Devils&league=nhl|title=Devils complete comeback to capture Atlantic Division title|publisher=MSG Network|accessdate=2007-03-05|year=2006}}</ref> In the first round of the playoffs, he beat the Rangers for the first time in his career, leading the Devils to a four-game sweep. But a 4<U+2013>1 series loss to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] eliminated the Devils in the next round.

During the time in between the lockout and the time the NHL returned, the league instituted a new rule preventing goaltenders from playing the puck behind the net beyond a [[trapezoid]]-shaped zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule31.html|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 31: Goaltender Penalties|publisher=NHL.com|year=2005|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>  This was viewed by many as singling out Brodeur, who is known for his puckhandling ability, and has come to be known as the "Brodeur Rule".<ref>{{cite web|author=Diamos, Jason.|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10616F835550C758DDDA00894DD404482|title=New Rule Will Take a Weapon Away from Brodeur|publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' (subscription required)|date=[[September 16]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jones, Tom.|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/18/Sports/Brodeur_not_handling_.shtml|title=Brodeur not handling new rule well|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|date=[[September 18]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>

In the current [[2006-2007 NHL season]], Brodeur made his ninth NHL All-Star Game appearance on [[January 24]], [[2007]], in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], and has risen on several NHL records lists. On [[December 9]], [[2006]], he posted a 2<U+2013>0 victory over the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for his 462nd career win, moving him into 2nd place on the all-time list ahead of active goalie [[Ed Belfour]] of the [[Florida Panthers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news;_ylt=ApEG9C82o9RC5C8bZdGzTzpivLYF?slug=afp-ihockeynhldevils&prov=afp&type=lgns|title=Brodeur vaults into 2nd on all-time win list|publisher=Yahoo!

Brodeur was selected as [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]]'s backup goalie to [[Patrick Roy]] for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], [[Japan]], but did not get to play. According to his book, he has never forgiven Roy for demanding to start every game.

In the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games/Ice hockey|2002 Olympics]] at [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], Brodeur won gold for Canada, playing in every game except the tournament opener against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]]. He had the best GAA in the tournament and went undefeated, stopping 31 of 33 shots in the Gold Medal victory over [[American national men's hockey team|Team USA]].

He then led Team Canada to a [[World Cup of Hockey]] championship in 2004, allowing only 5 goals in 5 games. He led all goalies in GAA and save percentage while going undefeated. He had another impressive performance for the team at the world hockey championships in the following year. After this, ''The Sports Forecaster 2005-06'' said the following:<ref name="MainBio"/>

{{cquote|Brodeur is arguably the top goaltender in the world right now. Fresh off a World Cup win in 2004, and another strong performance at the 2005 IIHF World hockey championships. Also, he's still among the best puck-handling goaltenders in the game, though the NHL's new rule changes may somewhat alter that effectiveness.}}

Brodeur was most recently selected as the starter for Team Canada in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. He started in 4 of 6 games, but Canada failed to win a medal after losing to [[Russian national men's ice hockey team|Russia]] in the quarterfinals.

Overall, Brodeur has played for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Canada]] in:
* 1996 [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] ('''Silver''')
* [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]] (Lost Final)
* [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympic Games]] (failed to medal)
* [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympic Games]] ('''Gold''')
* [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]] ('''Champions''')
* [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2005 World Championships]] ('''Silver''')
* [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]] (failed to medal)

==Personal life==
[[Image:Brodeurbook.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Brodeur's 2006 autobiography]]
Martin and Melanie Dubois (native from [[Saint-Liboire, Quebec]], Canada) were married in 1995, and have four children.<ref name="Children">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ_33.shtml|title=Stanley Cup Journals:33|publisher=hhof.com|accessdate=2007-02-28|year=2003}}</ref> Their first son Anthony was born in 1995, and the following year they had twin sons, William and Jeremy. In 2002 they had a daughter, Annabelle Antoinette.  Melanie Brodeur filed for divorce in 2003 after it was revealed that he was having an affair with his sister-in-law Genevieve Nault.<ref name="divorce">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2003/story?id=1557270|title=Brodeur's wife files for divorce|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> The incident added some fuel to the fire for hecklers during the playoffs. In a 2003 second round playoff matchup against the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], a notable sign held up read "Tickets to a Stanley Cup playoff game: $95. Alimony demanded from your wife: $9 million. Sex with your sister-in-law: Priceless" in the context of the [[MasterCard]] hockey commercials.<ref name="heckling">{{cite web|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/nhl/articles/20030510/472987.html|title=Canada's capital primed for East finals|publisher=sportingnews.com|year=2003|accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref> 

In his spare time, Brodeur is regarded as a brilliant chef and an engaging raconteur.<ref name="HHOFjournal"/> For each of the three times that the Devils won the Stanley Cup, he has hosted a street hockey tournament in his hometown of Lac-Sainte-Marie, [[Quebec]], where he plays his childhood position of [[forward (hockey)|forward]]. His oldest brother Denis Jr. is a photographer like his father, and his other older brother Claude was a pitcher in the [[Montreal Expos]]' farm system. Brodeur also has two sisters, Line and Sylvie.

In 2005, Brodeur started co-authoring his autobiography with long-time [[Toronto Star]] columnist and [[ESPN]] contributor [[Damien Cox]]. Entitled ''Brodeur: Beyond the Crease'', it was released in October 2006. Some of the things Brodeur talks about in the book are player salaries and contracts, NHL marketing, [[Lou Lamoriello]] and the [[Prudential Center|Devils' new arena in Newark]].Brodeur also includes his views on the "new NHL" after the lockout, and how it affects his career.<ref name="biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Brodeur-Beyond-Crease-Damien-Cox/dp/0470838515/sr=8-1/qid=1165386067/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6784776-9795118?ie=UTF8&s=books|title=Brodeur: Beyond the Crease (Hardcover)|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=Amazon.com|year=2006}}</ref> The book's photographs were shot by Martin's father, [[Denis Brodeur|Denis]].

===Milestones===
Brodeur is the youngest goaltender in NHL history to reach the 300 and 400 regular season win plateaus. His 300th victory came on [[December 15]], [[2001]] with a 39-save shutout against the [[Ottawa Senators]] at the [[Scotiabank Place|Corel Centre]]. His 400th victory was on [[March 23]], [[2004]], at the [[Office Depot Center]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], as the Devils defeated the hometown [[Florida Panthers]]. Brodeur stopped twenty-one shots, and needed to work overtime to get the win. With the victory he also became the first goaltender to win 400 games playing every game for the same team.<ref name="MainBio"/>

===Records===
In over thirteen seasons with the New Jersey Devils, Brodeur has acquired more than thirty franchise records, including most all-time, regular season and playoff wins, shutouts, games and minutes played by a goalie, shots faced, points by a goalie, losses, ties, and goals allowed as well as lowest goals-against-average and highest save percentage.
