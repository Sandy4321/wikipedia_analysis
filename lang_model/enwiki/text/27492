He lives and works in [[Calcutta]] and [[Santiniketan]].

== Early life ==
Son of Shantilata and Manmathanath Dasgupta, a Brahmo missionary and social worker, he was born at [[Shillong]], [[Assam]], [[India]] in [[1921]].  In 1944 he married, Supriya Das, a daughter of Brahmananda Dashgupta, brother of poet [[Jibanananda Das]].  His daughter [[Aparna Sen]] is a well known actress and filmmaker. Actress [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] is his granddaughter.

Chidananda had a flick with politics during the anti-British [[Quit India movement]] days of 1940s. This forced him on to jobs <U+2013> teaching at St. Columba<U+2019>s College, [[Hazaribagh#Bengali community|Hazaribagh]], personal assistant to [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] at the Indian Statistical Institute, [[Calcutta]], teaching at City College, Calcutta, journalism, and then a plush job in advertising with Imperial Tobacco. It was a varied life.

An elderly man, Chidananda is physically impaired now. He uses wheel chair to move. His voice is barely audible. However he remains active. He always dresses up in trademark cream kurta-pyjama. His white stubble around the cheeks well passes for a [[French beard]]. It has been said that Chidananda Das Gupta is a picture of 'restraint' and 'dignity'.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/07/22/stories/2004072200970100.htm The Hindu : A lifetime's work, A lifetime's award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==The film society movement==
In 1947, Chidananda, along with [[Satyajit Ray]] and Hari Sadhan Dasgupta, founded the [[Calcutta Film Society]]. The opportunity to see the best of world cinema had a decisive impact on Ray as well as others like [[Mrinal Sen]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]].

In 1959, the Federation of Film Societies of India was set up at the initiative of Dasgupta, Satyajit Ray, Mrs. Vijaya Mulay, Mrs. Ammu Swaminathan, Robert Hawkins, Abul Hassan and A. Roychowdhury. The Federation has played a major role in the spread of the film society movement in India.

==Writing and Translations==
Chidananda is well known for his essays and translations of Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]] and [[Jibanananda Das]]. He had a close association with poet Jibanananda Das during the latter's lifetime which gave him unique insights into the poetry of Jibanananda Das that is often alleged to be obscure and unintelligible.<ref>Blurb of ''Selected Poems - Jibanananda Das''</ref>

The most famous poem of [[Bengali poetry|Bengali literature]], namely, [[Banalata Sen]] by poet [[Jibanananda Das]] has been rendered into [[English language|English]] by Chidananda. It reads as folows:</b>
<blockquote>
'''Banalata Sen'''</b>
</b><br />
For aeons have I roamed the roads of the earth.<br /></b>
From the seas of Ceylon to the straits of Malaya<br /></b>
I have journeyed, alone, in the enduring night,<br /></b>
And down the dark corridor of time I have walked<br /></b>
Through mist of Bimbisara, Asoka, darker Vidarbha.<br /></b>
Round my weary soul the angry waves still roar;<br /></b>
My only peace I knew with Banalata Sen of Natore.<br /></b>
<br /></b>
Her hair was dark as night in Vidisha;<br /></b>
Her face the sculpture of Sravasti.<br /></b>
I saw her, as a sailor after the storm<br /></b>
Rudderless in the sea, spies of a sudden<br /></b>
The grass-green heart of the leafy island.<br /></b>
<U+2018>Where were you so long?' she asked, and more<br /></b>
With her bird's-nest eyes, Banalata Sen of Natore.<br /></b>
<br /></b>
As the footfall of dew comes evening;<br /></b>
The raven wipes the smell of warm sun<br /></b>
From its wings; the world's noises die.<br /></b>
And in the light of fireflies the manuscript<br /></b>
Prepares to weave the fables of night;<br /></b>
Every bird is home, every river reached the ocean.<br /></b>
Darkness remains; and time for Banalata Sen.<ref>''Beyond Land and Time'', edited by Faizul Latif Chowdhury and Golam Mustafa, 2008: Somoy Prokashon, Dhaka</ref>

If she does not marry before sunset, something horrible will happen to her; therefore she must marry the servant boy. After the ceremony, the boy is exiled and the union remains unconsummated. Years pass and tragedy befalls the rajah who loses all his wealth. Suddenly the servant boy returns, only he is no longer a servant. Now he has become wealthy and powerful enough to take the rajah's position from him.
