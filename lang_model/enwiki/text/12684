The '''Grade I listed buildings in Somerset''', England, demonstrate the history and diversity of its architecture. The [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] consists of a [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]], administered by [[Somerset County Council]], which is divided into five [[Districts of England|districts]], and two [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. The districts of Somerset are [[West Somerset]], [[South Somerset]], [[Taunton Deane]], [[Mendip]] and [[Sedgemoor]]. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following the breakup of the [[county of Avon]], are [[North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]]. These unitary authorities include areas that were once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950493_en_1.htm |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |work=HMSO }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the term [[listed building]] refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be "buildings of exceptional interest".<ref name="MCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=514&documentID=1906|title=What is a listed building?|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=8 December 2007}}</ref> Listing was begun by a provision in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]. Once listed, strict limitations are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2133903|title=Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9)|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=17 December 2007}}</ref> rests with [[English Heritage]], a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations.

Each of the districts include [[Norman architecture|Norman]]- or [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-era churches, many of which are included in the [[Somerset towers]], a collection of distinctive, mostly [[spire]]less [[Gothic architecture]] church towers. The prolific construction of the towers<U+2014>some started before 1360<U+2014>was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright.<ref name="poyntz">{{cite book |last= Poyntz Wright|first= Peter|title= The Parish Church Towers of Somerset, Their construction, craftsmanship and chronology 1350 - 1550|year= 1981|month= |publisher= Avebury Publishing Company|isbn= 0-86127-502-0}}</ref> But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals]]<U+2014>their most important commissions.

Apart from the churches, each area has its own characteristics. Most of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath's]] Grade I listed buildings are made from the local golden-coloured [[Bath Stone]], and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]].<ref name="gadd"/> In the Mendip district, the greatest concentrations of these cluster around the cathedral and abbey in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] and in [[Glastonbury]]. North Somerset features bridges and piers along with a selection of [[Manor house]]s. The Sedgemoor district has many buildings related to trade and commerce centered on [[Bridgwater]]; while in South Somerset abbeys, priories and farmhouses predominate. Taunton Deane includes the defensive [[Taunton Castle]], similarly [[Dunster Castle]] and related buildings in [[Dunster]] feature in West Somerset.
