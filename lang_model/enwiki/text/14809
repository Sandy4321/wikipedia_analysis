'''Mount Jefferson''' is the high point of the [[Toquima Range]] in north-central [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]], in central [[Nevada]] in the western [[United States]].  It is located about 50 miles north of the community of [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]].  Three distinct summits are located on a broad area of subalpine [[tundra]]: North Summit rises to {{convert|11814|ft|m|0}}<ref name="pb"/>, Middle Summit to {{convert|11686|ft|m|0}}<ref name="pb"/>, and South Summit to {{convert|11941|ft|m}}.<ref name="ngs"/> During the [[Pleistocene]], alpine [[glacier]]s eroded several [[cirque]]s east of the summit plateau. The higher elevations of this section of the Toquima Range are protected as the [[Alta Toquima Wilderness|Alta Toquima Wilderness Area]].

As the high point of a range which is well separated from other ranges by low basins, Mount Jefferson has a particularly high [[topographic prominence]] of {{convert|5861|ft|m}}.  This is the third greatest prominence in Nevada (after [[Mount Charleston|Charleston Peak]] and [[Wheeler Peak (Nevada)|Wheeler Peak]]).<ref>
