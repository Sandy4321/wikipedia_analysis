"'''Another Simpsons Clip Show'''" is the third episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]], which originally aired [[September 25]], [[1994]]. It was written by [[Jon Vitti]], and directed by [[David Silverman]], and its plotline revolves around romance. It is the second Simpsons episode featuring a [[clip show]] format, and uses clips from all the previous five seasons.

==Plot==
[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] is reading ''[[The Bridges of Madison County]]'' one night and wakes up [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to ask if he thinks the [[Romantic love|romance]] has gone out of their [[marriage]].  He grumbles and throws the book into a [[fireplace]] which was built off-screen in the bedroom (but is actually a clip of Homer tossing a book into a fire from [[Dog of Death]]). Marge groans and falls asleep.

In the morning, Marge gets the family together to discuss romance, but they can only come up with vignettes from their failed relationships (and in the parents' case, near-extramarital paramours) in the form of clips from previous episodes.  However, Homer saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together (in clips from the second season episode "[[The Way We Was]]"). Ultimately, the kids do not care and wind up watching ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' while Homer and Marge share another special moment.

==Production==
As the title of the episode suggests, it is second clip show episode of ''The Simpsons'' after [[So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show]], the 18th episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It was written by [[Jon Vitti]], who used the [[pseudonym]] Penny Wise in the [[closing credits]] because he did not want to be credited for writing a clip show.<ref name="Groening"/> The episode also includes contributions from [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Frank Mula]], [[David Richardson (writer)|David Richardson]],  [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]], [[Bill Oakley]], [[Josh Weinstein]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Sam Simon]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Jay Kogen]], [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], [[Nell Scovell]], [[David M. Stern]], [[George Meyer]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Robert Cohen (writer)|Robert Cohen]], [[Bill Canterbury]], and [[Dan McGrath]].<ref>Alberti (2004), pp 316.</ref>

During the early years of the show, the staff were forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Another Simpsons Clip Show"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There were originally intense pressure on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. However, writers and producers felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2005|title=The Simpsons The Complete Sixth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Another Simpsons Clip Show"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce, but they could sell [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] rights at full price.<ref name="Groening2">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

At the beginning of the episode, Lisa explains to Bart that the "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon they are watching is in fact a mishmash of clips from the older cartoons. Later, it becomes clear to the viewer that the episode is a collection of clips from the past episodes, but not to Bart and Lisa.<ref name=clipshow>Turner (2005), pp. 416.</ref>

==Cultural references==
At the beginning of the episode, when Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are watching ''Itchy and Scratchy'', Marge says they watch the same shows all the time while Lisa says that the Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes (and pointing out that ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'' do it all the time). This is a sly joke about the construction of this episode, where the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen, all taking the idea of this episode being a clip show to the extreme.<ref name=clipshow/> The episode also makes a reference to the [[Mike Nichols]]'s 1967 movie ''[[The Graduate]]''.<ref name=emol>{{cite web|url=http://emol.org/emclub/?q=season6 |title=A Special Simpsons Season Six Clip Show |publisher=Entertainment Magazine |date=2005-12-10|author=J Floyd King|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref><!-- 
*The theme of the episode is love.<ref name=emol/> 
*grandpa's story-> Lisa: not a happy ending story, but a detached tale of modern alienation
*The episode was generally forced to be produced by [[20th Century Fox]] who wanted another episode; the credited writer Penny Wise (who was actually [[Jon Vitti]]) pokes fun at this (from the phrase "Penny wise, pound foolish").  "Mrs. Wise" would be credited as writing a future clip show, "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]", which would credit the director as "[[David Silverman|Pound Foolish]]", implying a poke at FOX.
*The [[magazine]] that Lisa holds up at the end of the episode is called ''Non-Threatening Boys'' (from "[[Radio Bart]]").
*This episode was put together very quickly (note that the production code for this episode is 2F33, the last in the 2F series, yet it aired before any others in this series did), and it is rumoured that the production code in the end credits was originally erroneously listed. On the lone network airing of this episode, the first 3 looks somewhat out of place compared to the other characters; in syndication and the season 6 [[The Simpsons DVD boxsets|DVD boxset]], the second 3 appears out of place. -->
