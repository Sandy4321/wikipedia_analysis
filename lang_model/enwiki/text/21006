The '''Andrew Evans case''' concerns the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of '''Andrew Evans''', an English soldier from [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]], [[Staffordshire]], who served 25 years in custody after confessing to the 1972 murder of Judith Roberts, a 14-year-old schoolgirl from nearby [[Tamworth]]. Evans was stationed at [[Whittington Barracks]] near [[Lichfield]] <U+2013> an army base in close proximity to Tamworth <U+2013> when Judith was dragged from her bicycle and battered to death in June 1972, and later confessed to the crime after seeing the girl's face in a dream.

Evans was charged with Judith's murder in October 1972 after he presented himself at a local police station, asking to see a photograph of the victim, and making a signed statement following three days of interviews in which he maintained his guilt. Although he subsequently retracted his confession, claiming it had been given under duress a jury convicted him of murder following a trial in 1973, and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Evans later claimed that his confession was a result of psychological problems he was experiencing at the time, and his case was taken up by the human rights group ''Justice'' after he contacted them about his case in 1994.

With no other evidence apart from his own words against him, Evans's conviction was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in 1997, and he was released from prison. The time he spent in custody is the longest period served by an individual in the United Kingdom as the result of a wrongful conviction. Evans was awarded <U+00A3>750,000 in compensation from the [[Home Office]] in 2000, while the identity of the real killer remains unknown to the present day.

==Background==

Judith Roberts, a 14-year-old [[grammar school]] pupil from [[Wiggington]], near Tamworth, left her home on 7 June 1972 to cycle along Comberford Lane. Her body was discovered later the same day under a pile of hedge clippings and plastic fertiliser bags in a field adjacent to the road, and a subsequent post mortem concluded she had been battered to death.<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2011-09-08/>

Police launched a murder investigation involving 200 detectives, who collected more than 15,400 sets of fingerprints and in excess of 11,000 statements. In addition, officers visited over 11,000 addresses as they made house-to-house inquiries, road blocks were established in the area, and 4,200 separate pieces of evidence were followed up. However, in spite of what became one of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]' most intensive hunts for a murder suspect for several years, the killer remained at large.<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2011-09-08/>

==Under suspicion==

In June 1972 Andrew Evans was a 17-year-old soldier stationed at [[Whittington Barracks]] near [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire, but having suffered an [[asthma attack]] he was awaiting discharge on medical grounds, and on 7 June, the evening Judith Roberts was killed he was a day away from leaving the Army. A nervous and socially inadequate teenager, he had joined the Army in the hope of a career, and after his discharge was treated for [[major depressive disorder|depression]] with prescription drugs.<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/36649.stm |title=Murder conviction quashed after 25 years |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=3 December 1997 |accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09>{{cite news|first=Jeevan |last=Vasagar |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/jun/09/jeevanvasagar |title=Wrongly convicted soldier gets <U+00A3>1m |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 June 2000 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>

As part of the police investigation into the murder, soldiers at Whittington on 7 June were required to complete a  form giving an account of their whereabouts for that evening, and providing references. Evans said that he had spent that evening at the barracks, giving the names of three other soldiers who could verify his presence there. However, police subsequently failed to trace one of the named soldiers, and discovered the remaining two had left the barracks prior to 7 June. Evans was questioned again in October by police who visited him at his grandmother's house.<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/><ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09/>

On the morning after that interview, Evans told his grandmother that he planned to visit the police station because he wished to see a picture of Judith. He subsequently presented himself to officers at Longton Police Station in a distressed state, where he made his request, telling them he had dreamt of Judith: "I keep seeing a face. I want to see a picture of her. I wonder if I've done it."<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/>

During a series of interviews with detectives, Evans claimed that he had dragged Judith from her bicycle, then struggled with her in a field. Asked if he was the killer he answered, "This is it. I don't know. Show me a picture and I'll tell you if I've seen it."<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/> Investigators also asked him whether he'd ever visited Tamworth, to which he replied, "I don't know. I don't know. I could have been. I forget where I have been."<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/> Detectives initially did not believe his account, dismissing him as a fantasist, but over the three day period in which Evans was questioned they became increasingly certain he was the killer. After giving a signed statement under caution, Evans was charged with murder.<ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09/>

Evans's trial was held at Birmingham Crown Court in June 1973.<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2011-09-08>{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Cowan |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/crime-news/crimes-from-the-archives/2011/09/08/from-the-archives-wrong-man-jailed-for-murder-of-teenager-97319-29386758/ |title=From The Archives: Wrong man jailed for murder of teenager |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> By this time he believed that he was innocent, and had retracted his original statement. It was claimed that his confession had been made with the use of brietal, a so-called truth drug that was later discredited for inducing false memories. Prosecution and defence lawyers both agreed the drug's use. Apart from the confession, no other evidence was presented; there was no scientific evidence against him nor any eyewitnesses to support or refute the Crown's case.<ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09/> However, Evans could not provide an alibi for 7 June 1972,<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2011-09-08/> and was convicted of Judith's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09/>

==Appeal==

Evans continued to maintain his innocence following his conviction, claiming he had confessed to Judith's murder because of psychological problems. In 1994 he wrote to the human rights organisation ''Justice'', who agreed to take up his case. Represented by their solicitor, Kate Akester, Evans won the right to appeal against his conviction. The hearing took place at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in December 1997 before three judges; Lord Chief Justice Lord Binghanm, Mr Justice Jowitt and Mr Justice Douglas Brown. Evans was represented there by Patrick O'Connor [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/>

The hearing was told that in 1972 Evans had been taking medication prescribed to him for depression. During his questioning, the Court was told that no medical assistance was offered despite his mental and physical condition. Police also did not offer Evans access to a solicitor, and often failed to caution him as procedure required. O'Connor said that Evans's confession would not have been given had a doctor or solicitor been present because he would have been diagnosed as unfit to be interviewed.<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/>

On the question of the content of his statement, Lord Bingham said, "In this he clearly implicated himself as the murderer. Many of the details in this statement accorded with the facts as then known or later established, but some did not."<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/> The Court quashed Evans's conviction and he was released from custody with immediate effect.<ref name=BBC-1997-12-03/> 

Evans sought compensation from the Home Office for his wrongful conviction, and in 2000 was awarded <U+00A3>750,000. The sum was the largest award made in the United Kingdom to a person who has had their conviction overturned. Speaking of his compensation, Evans said, "For the past two and a half years we have been fighting for this money and at last it has been sorted. I am relieved. I will never be fully free - every time I lock a door I have flashbacks to being in prison."<ref name=Guardian-2000-06-09/>
