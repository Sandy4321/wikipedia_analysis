''Last of the Summer Wine'' is set and filmed in and around [[Holmfirth]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, and centres around a trio of old men whose lineup has changed over the years. The original trio consisted of [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as the scruffy and child-like Compo, [[Peter Sallis]] as deep-thinking, meek Clegg, and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as authoritarian and snobbish Blamire. [[Brian Wilde]] joined the cast as the quirky [[Veteran|war veteran]] Foggy when Bates left in 1976 after two series. The men never seem to grow up, and develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their youthful stunts. The cast has grown to include a variety of supporting characters, each contributing their own subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio. The main cast of the 29th series consists of Sallis, [[Frank Thornton]] as former police officer Truly, [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] as the childish Alvin, and [[Kathy Staff]] as Alvin's grumpy next door neighbour, Nora Batty.

==Production==
===History and development===
In 1972, [[Duncan Wood]], at that time the head of [[BBC]] Comedy, watched a [[dramatic programming|drama]] on television called ''The Misfit'', written by [[Roy Clarke]]. Wood was so impressed with his ability to inject comedy into a drama that he offered Clarke the opportunity to write a [[situation comedy|sitcom]].<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /> Initially Clarke was not enthusiastic about the BBC's idea for a programme about three old men, which he felt would be a dull concept for a half hour sitcom, and nearly turned the job down. His solution was that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced, and either unemployed or retired. This would leave them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' />

Clarke chose the original title, ''The Last of the Summer Wine'', to convey the idea that the characters are not in the autumn of their lives but the summer, even though it may be "the last of the summer". BBC producers hated this at first, and insisted that it remain a temporary [[working title]], while the cast worried that viewers would forget the name of the show.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /> The working title was changed later to ''The Library Mob'', a reference to one of the trio's regular haunts early in the series. Clarke switched back to his original preference shortly before production began,<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /> a title which was shortened to ''Last of the Summer Wine'' after the pilot show.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;16</ref>

''The Last of the Summer Wine'' premiered as an episode of BBC's ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' on 4 January 1973. The pilot, "Of Funerals and Fish", received enough positive response that a full series was commissioned to be aired before the end of the year.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16-17">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;16-17</ref> Although the initial series did not do well in the ratings, the BBC ordered a second series in 1975.<ref name="Bright and Ross 17-19">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;17&ndash;19</ref>

===Filming===
[[Barry Took]], who had produced a series of documentaries for the BBC about [[working men's club]]s, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. Although Took's series of documentaries was a failure, one of the clubs in the small [[West Yorkshire]] town of [[Holmfirth]], Burnlee Working Men's Club, drew the highest ratings of all the programmes. Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television series and suggested it to Duncan Wood, who was at that time filming ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]''.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;13&ndash;14</ref> Wood passed the suggestion along to [[James Gilbert]] and Roy Clarke, who then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of ''Last of the Summer Wine''.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /><ref name="Summer Wine Online">{{cite web |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/story.htm#Why%20was%20it%20Filmed%20in%20Holmfirth?%20Its%20all%20Thanks%20to%20Barry%20Took!|title= The Summer Wine Story: Why was it filmed in Holmfirth?|publisher=Summer Wine Appreciation Society | work = Summer Wine Online|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>

Though the exterior shots have always been [[Filming location|filmed]] on location in Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed in front of a live studio audience at [[BBC Television Centre]] in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, ''Last of the Summer Wine'' became the first comedy series to do away with the live studio audience, relocating all of the filming to Holmfirth.<ref name="Bright and Ross 117">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;117</ref> The episodes are filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter is recorded and then spliced into each episode to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of [[Laugh track|canned laughter]].<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /><ref name="Bright and Ross 117" />

The show uses actual businesses and homes in and around Holmfirth, including Sid's Caf<U+00E9> and Nora Batty's house, a real Holmfirth residence owned by Sonia Whitehead.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /> Although this has helped the Holmfirth economy and made it a [[tourist destination]], tensions have occasionally surfaced between Holmfirth residents and the crew. One such incident, regarding compensation to local residents, prompted producer [[Alan J. W. Bell]] to consider not filming in Holmfirth anymore. The situation escalated to the point that Bell filmed a scene in which Nora Batty put her house up for sale.<ref name='The Huddersfield Daily Examiner 2005-08-16'>{{cite news | first=Neil | last=Atkinson |  title=Is it the Last of Summer Wine? | date=[[2005-08-16]] |  url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/travel-news/last-of-summer-wine/2005/08/16/is-it-the-last-of-summer-wine-86081-15863732/ | work =The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |  accessdate = 2007-12-04 | language = }}</ref>

In May 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that [[Frank Thornton]] and [[Peter Sallis]] would no longer appear in outdoor scenes of future series because of the cost of insuring actors over the age of 80. Thornton and Sallis, both 87, will only film scenes indoors while younger actors film the outdoor scenes.<ref name="The Times 2008-05-10">{{cite news | first=Adam | last=Sherwin |  title=Last of the Summer Wine antics 'dangerous' for elderly actors | date=[[2008-05-10]] |  url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3905028.ece| work =The Times |  accessdate = 2008-05-30 | language = }}</ref>

===Crew===
Every episode  of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' is written by [[Roy Clarke]]. The ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' pilot and all episodes of the first series were produced and directed by James Gilbert. [[Bernard Thompson (director)|Bernard Thompson]] produced and directed the second series of episodes in 1975.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16-17" /> In 1976 [[Sydney Lotterby]] took over as producer and director.

W. Bell took over as producer and director. Bell, in an effort to get each scene exactly right, has been known for his use of more film than his predecessors, more takes,<ref name="30 Years LOTSW"/> and for using wider angles that feature more of the local Holmfirth landscape.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" />

In 1983, Lotterby returned to the show at the insistence of [[Brian Wilde]], who preferred Lotterby's use of tight shots focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell's wide-angle scenes. Lotterby produced and directed one additional series before departing again the same year.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" /> Bell then returned to the show beginning with the 1983 Christmas special and has produced and directed all episodes of the show from that time until June 2008.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" />

===Music===
[[Composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]] [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]], who had also produced themes for such series as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister]]'', created the theme for the show. The BBC initially disliked Hazlehurst's theme, feeling it was not proper for a comedy programme to have such mellow music. He was asked to play the music faster for more comedic effect, but eventually his original slower version was accepted.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' />

The theme, an instrumental work, featured lyrics three times. The 1981 Christmas special, "Whoops", had two verses of lyrics written by Roy Clarke that were performed over the closing credits.  The 1983 film, "Getting Sam Home", used those two verses, with an additional two, and played them over the opening credits.  And an altered version was sung during Compo's funeral in the 2000 episode "Just a Small Funeral". Bill Owen also wrote a different version of the lyrics, but this version has never been used during an episode of the show.<ref name='SUMMER WINE MUSIC AND LYRICS'>{{cite news | title=Summer Wine Music and Lyrics | work=Summer Wine Online | publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society  | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/lyrics.htm| work =Summer Wine Online |  publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-27 | language = }}</ref>

Composing the score for each episode until his death in 2007,<ref name='Hazlehurst dies'>{{cite news |  last=  |  title=Theme tune writer Hazlehurst dies |  url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7023501.stm| work =BBC News|date = 2007-10-02 |  accessdate = 2008-01-02 | language = }}</ref> Hazlehurst spent an average of ten hours per episode watching scenes and making notes for music synchronisation. Hazlehurst then recorded the music using an orchestra consisting of a [[guitar]], [[harmonica]], two [[violins]], a [[viola]], [[cello]], [[accordion]], [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]], [[flute]], and [[percussion]].<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' />

==Characters and casting==

[[Image:Lotsw.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The most famous of the ''Last of the Summer Wine'' trios: From left to right: [[Peter Sallis]] as Norman Clegg, [[Brian Wilde]] as "Foggy" Dewhurst, and [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as "Compo" Simmonite.]]
Initially, the only certain cast member for the show was [[Peter Sallis]]. Clarke had already collaborated on a few scripts with him, and the character of Norman Clegg was created especially for Sallis, who liked the character and agreed to play him.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;14</ref> He was soon joined by an actor he had previously worked with, comedy actor [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]], as Cyril Blamire.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;15</ref>

It was [[James Gilbert|James Gilbert's]] idea to cast [[Actor|film actor]] [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as Compo Simmonite, a choice that Clarke initially disagreed with. Compo was meant to be a solid northern character, and Clarke saw Owen as an archetypal [[cockney]].  But Gilbert had seen Owen playing such northern characters in the [[Royal Court Theatre]], and once Clarke had gone to [[London]] for a [[read-through]] with Owen he recognised his potential.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16-17" />

On-screen chemistry with existing players determined the later changes to the cast. [[Brian Wilde]], [[Michael Aldridge]], and [[Frank Thornton]] each brought a sense of completion to the trio after the departure of the preceding third man.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;61&ndash;67</ref> [[Tom Owen]] provided a direct link between his father and himself after the death of Bill Owen.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /><ref name="Bright and Ross 36">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;36</ref> [[Keith Clifford]] was added following three popular guest appearances on the show.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;139&ndash;140</ref> [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] was chosen as Nora Batty's neighbour because of his work on ''[[George and Mildred]]'', where he played the [[wikt:henpecked|hen-pecked]] husband to a strong-willed woman.<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' /> In 2008, the BBC announced that [[Russ Abbot]] would join the cast as a relatively more youthful actor in an upcoming series.<ref name="The Times 2008-05-10" />

The original cast of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' also included a handful of characters who the trio regularly interacted with. [[Kathy Staff]] was chosen to play Compo's neighbour, Nora Batty. Gilbert was initially sceptical about casting Staff, but changed his mind after she padded herself to look bigger and read from a scene between her character and Owen's.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;74&ndash;75</ref> This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio: [[John Comer]] and [[Jane Freeman]] as Sid<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;94</ref> and Ivy,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;77</ref> the quarreling husband-and-wife owners of the local caf<U+00E9>; and [[Blake Butler]] and [[Rosemary Martin]] as Mr. Wainwright<ref name="Bright and Ross 102">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;102</ref> and Mrs. Partridge,<ref> Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;89</ref> the librarians having a not-so-secret affair. Butler and Martin, however, were dropped as major characters after the first series. According to Peter Sallis, Roy Clarke felt there was little more he could do with them.<ref name="Peter Sallis interview">{{cite news | first=Margaret | last=Tillotson|  title=Interview with Peter Sallis 1994 | publisher=Summer Wine Appreciation Society | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/cleggy.htm  | work =Summer Wine Online|  accessdate = 2007-12-27 | language = }}</ref>

Supporting cast members have been added throughout the run of the show. [[Gordon Wharmby]] was the only addition who was not previously a professional actor, but a Holmfirth local who performed so well during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan J. W. Bell cast him in one episode. Audiences liked Pegden and he eventually became a regular character on the show.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;99&ndash;101</ref>

===Guest appearances===
When Alan J. W. Bell took over as producer, the plots of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' moved away from the original dialogue-packed scenes in the pub and the library, and guest actors were brought in to interact with the trio in new situations. Although many of these guest appearances would last for only one episode,<ref name="Bright and Ross 30">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;30</ref><ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;145</ref> some led to a permanent role on the series, as in the cases of Gordon Wharmby,<ref name="Car and Garter ep">{{cite episode|title=Car and Garter|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

==Scenario==
''Last of the Summer Wine'' focuses on a trio of older men and their youthful antics. The original trio consisted of Compo Simmonite, Norman Clegg, and Cyril Blamire. When Blamire left in 1975 after two series, the third member of the trio would be recast four times over the next three decades: Foggy Dewhurst in 1976,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;19</ref> Seymour Utterthwaite in 1986,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;26</ref> Foggy again in 1990,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;29</ref> and Truly Truelove in 1997.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;31&ndash;32</ref> After Compo died in 2000, Compo's son, Tom Simmonite, filled the gap for the rest of that series,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;36</ref> and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001.<ref name="Getting Barry's Goat ep">{{cite episode|title=Getting Barry's Goat|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

The trio explore the world around them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities.

''Last of the Summer Wine'' is the [[List of longest running U.K. television series|longest-running comedy programme in Britain]]. Each series has between six and twelve episodes; most are thirty minutes in length, with some specials running longer. There have been 278 entries between 1973 and 2008, counting the pilot, all episodes of the series, specials, and two films. The 29th series began airing on 22 June 2008<ref name='BBC Programmes ETF'>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cb3cy|title= BBC Programmes - Last of the Summer Wine - Enter the Finger|publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> and concluded on 31 August 2008.<ref name='BBC Programmes GOOTT' /> Actress [[Juliette Kaplan]] confirmed on her web site that a 30th series began production in June 2008.<ref name="Juliette Kaplan" />

===Specials===
In 1978, the BBC commissioned a ''Last of the Summer Wine'' [[Christmas in the media|Christmas special]] instead of a new series. Titled "Small Tune on a Penny Wassail", it aired on 26 December 1978. Other Christmas programmes followed in 1979 and 1981. The 1981 special, "Whoops", gained 17&nbsp;million viewers and was beaten only by ''[[Coronation Street]]'' for the number one spot. Since that time, Christmas shows have been produced infrequently and may constitute the only new episodes in years without an order for a new series.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;20&ndash;22</ref> This happened often during the 1980s when Roy Clarke's commitment to ''[[Open All Hours]]'' prevented the production of a full series every year.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;23&ndash;24</ref> The specials often include well-known guest stars such as John Cleese<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;139</ref> and June Whitfield.<ref name="Potts in Pole Position ep" />

The first New Years special, "The Man who Nearly Knew Pavarotti", was commissioned in 1994. The hour-long show aired on 1 January 1995 and featured [[Norman Wisdom]] as a piano player who had lost the confidence to play. <ref name="Bright and Ross 30" /> One additional New Years programme was produced and broadcast in 2000 to celebrate the [[Millennium|new millennium]]. It featured the second guest appearance by [[Keith Clifford]] and a guest appearance by [[Dora Bryan]]. Titled "Last Post and Pigeon", the show ran for sixty minutes and dealt with the trio's [[pilgrimage]] to visit World War II graves in France. Part of this special was shot on location in France.<ref name="Bright and Ross 35-36">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;35&ndash;36</ref>

===Films===
In 1983, Bill Owen suggested to returning producer Alan J. W. Bell that Roy Clarke's novelisation of the series (see [[#Other media|below]]) should be made into a feature length special. Other [[British sitcom]]s such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]'' had previously produced films made for the cinema. The BBC were initially sceptical as they had never before commissioned a film based on a comedy series for original broadcast on television. They nevertheless commissioned a ninety minute film named "Getting Sam Home", which aired on 27 December 1983, and started a trend which would continue with other British sitcoms, including ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24"/>

After the success of "Getting Sam Home", a second film was made in 1986. Titled "Uncle of the Bride", the film featured the introduction of Michael Aldridge as Seymour, the new third man of the trio. The plot centred around the marriage of Seymour's niece, Glenda ([[Sarah Thomas (actress)|Sarah Thomas]]), to Barry ([[Mike Grady]]). Also making her first appearance in the film was [[Thora Hird]] as Seymour's sister and Glenda's mother, Edie. The second film proved a success and all four new characters were carried over to the show beginning with the ninth series in 1986.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;30&ndash;31</ref>

===Documentaries===
A [[documentary film]] was commissioned to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ''Last of the Summer Wine''. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews with the majority of cast and crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with [[Duncan Wood]] and [[Barry Took]] explained the origins of the show and how it came to be filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary aired on 30 March 1997.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16-17" />

An updated version of the documentary was commissioned for the 30th anniversary of the series. Aired on 13 April 2003, this version featured an expanded interview with [[Brian Wilde]] and new interviews with [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] and [[Burt Kwouk]].<ref name='30 Years LOTSW' />

===DVD releases===
In September 2002, the BBC began releasing boxed sets of episodes on DVD for [[DVD region code|region two]]. Each set contains two consecutive full series of episodes.<ref>{{cite news | first=June | last=Toy |  title=Summer Wine DVD - Fan's Review | publisher= Summer Wine Appreciation Society | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/bbc/dvd.htm | work =Summer Wine Online | accessdate = 2008-05-22 }}</ref> Three "best of" collections have been released for [[DVD region code|region one]], and a fourth is in production.

==Other adaptations==
===Spin-off===
{{Main|First of the Summer Wine}}

A [[spin-off]] [[prequel]] show, ''[[First of the Summer Wine]]'', premiered on [[BBC One]] in 1988. The new series was written by [[Roy Clarke]] and used different actors to follow the activities of the principal characters from ''Last of the Summer Wine'' in the months leading up to World War II. Unlike its mother show, ''First of the Summer Wine'' was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere.<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE">{{cite news |  title=First of the Summer Wine - Special Article |  url =http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/index.htm | work =Summer Wine Online| publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society |  accessdate = 2007-12-28 | language = }}</ref> New supporting characters were added to those from ''Last of the Summer Wine''. [[Peter Sallis]] and [[Jonathan Linsley]] were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.<ref name="Bright and Ross 160" />

The spin-off show could not build on its early success<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /> and was cancelled after two series of thirteen episodes in 1989.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;28&ndash;29</ref> Although the BBC has never rerun the show, it has been broadcast on [[UKTV Gold]]<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /> and internationally.<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - UNCOVERED!">{{cite news |title=First of the Summer Wine - Uncovered! |  url =http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm | work =Summer Wine Online| publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | language = }}</ref>

===Stage adaptation===
A live production of ''Last of the Summer Wine'', known informally as the "summer season", was produced in [[Bournemouth]] in 1984. While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg, Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24-25" /> The show focused on the men's interaction with Clegg's new neighbour, Howard ([[Kenneth Waller]]) and his wife, Pearl, played by a local actress. The first act built up to the appearance of Marina ([[Jean Fergusson]]), who was in correspondence with Howard. At the end of the first act, Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot.<ref name="Bright and Ross 25-26">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;25&ndash;26</ref> Howard and Marina's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television series. In the first series, the librarian, Mr. Wainwright, was having a love affair with his married assistant, Mrs. Partridge. Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret, especially from Mrs. Partridge's husband, the trio of old men were well aware of the affair.<ref name="Bright and Ross 102" /> The summer season reversed the roles: Howard became the married partner, and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24-25" />

The summer season proved to be a success and frequently played to packed houses. In 1985, the show was once again produced, first as a two-week tour of Britain, and then as another summer season in Bournemouth. Fergusson returned for the second summer season, once again playing Marina. [[Robert Fyfe]] replaced Waller in the role of Howard, and [[Juliette Kaplan]] took the role of Pearl for this season. Although the new characters were not intended to be carried over to the television series, Roy Clarke included them in four of the following six episodes of the 1985 series. All three characters remained and are still members of the television sitcom.<ref name="Bright and Ross 25-26" /> 

An amended version of the show toured across Britain in 1987. Sallis was reluctant to appear in the new production, and his role in the show was rewritten and played by [[Derek Fowlds]]. Because Owen was the only member of the television show's trio to appear in the production, it was retitled ''Compo Plays Cupid''. Once again, the summer season was a success.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;27</ref>

===Other media===
[[Hodder & Stoughton|Coronet Books]] released a [[novelization|novelisation]] of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' in 1974. Written by Roy Clark as an unaired original story, the novel featured Compo, Clegg and Blamire helping their friend, Sam, enjoy one last night with a glam girl. The book became the basis for the ''Last of the Summer Wine'' film, "Getting Sam Home", with Blamire being replaced by Foggy.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" /> In the late 1980s, Roy Clarke wrote novels featuring Compo, Clegg and Seymour. The books were published by [[Penguin Books]] under the series heading ''Summer Wine Chronicles'', and included such titles as ''Gala Week''<ref>{{cite book|first=Roy |last=Clarke |authorlink=Roy Clarke |year = 1986-10-09|title = ''Gala Week''|publisher =  [[Penguin Books]]|isbn=0-14-010105-5}}</ref> and ''The Moonbather''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roy |last=Clarke |authorlink=Roy Clarke |year = 1987-10-29|title = ''The Moonbather''|publisher =  [[Penguin Books]]|isbn=0-14-010997-8}}</ref>  Clarke later adapted ''The Moonbather'' into a stage play, which was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 October to 11 October 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.littletheatreclub.com/code/moonbather2003.htm|title= Moonbather 2003 |publisher=Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club |accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref>

In the early 1980s, a daily comic strip based on the show was drawn by Roger Mahoney and appeared in the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/artist.py?id=548 |title= Mahoney, Roger| publisher=The British Cartoon Archive|accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> A compilation of these strips, published by Express Books, was released in 1983.<ref>{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Clarke |authorlink=Roy Clarke |coauthors=Roger Mahoney |year=1983 |month=December |title=Last of the Summer Wine |publisher=Express Books |isbn=0-85079-136-7}}</ref>

In 1993, the Summer Wine Appreciation Society asked their members for their favourite musical themes from ''Last of the Summer Wine''. Ronnie Hazlehurst used the resulting list for an independently released CD collection, which was released under the name ''Last of the Summer Wine: Music from the TV Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.summer-wine.com/swcd.htm|title=Last of the Summer Wine: Review| first=Clive|last=Eardley|publisher=Summer Wine Appreciation Society|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> [[BBC Radio]] released audio-only versions of episodes starting in 1995.

During its first series, ''Last of the Summer Wine'' did not receive a high ratings share.

A 2003 survey by ''[[Radio Times]]'' found that ''Last of the Summer Wine'' was the programme readers most wanted to see cancelled.
