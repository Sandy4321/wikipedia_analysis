'''Hanover Square''' in [[Downtown Syracuse]], [[New York]], is a triangular-shaped [[public park]] located at the intersection of Warren, Water, and East Genesee streets. The  triangle was originally named '''Veteran's Park'''.<ref name = "parks"/>

The name may also refer to the larger '''Hanover Square Historic District''' which includes seventeen historic buildings in the area that was the first commercial district in Syracuse.<ref name="nrhptext">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Dennis|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Hanover Square Historic District|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=6313 |date=December 1975 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref>  In the warm weather months, entertainment is common on the plaza around the fountain.

== History ==

[[Image:Hanover-square 1900 veterans-park.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Veteran's Park in Syracuse, New York about 1900 - Later renamed to Hanover Square]]

{{See also|Downtown Syracuse}}

The public square was originally named '''Veteran's Park'''. It was renamed to Hanover Square after the ''Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument'' was dedicated in [[Clinton Square]] in 1910 and the function of commemorating [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse's]] war dead was shifted there. 

The triangular shape of the park came as a result of the city's new grid street system in the early 19th century which was "superimposed on the diagonal route" of early Genesee Turnpike (now known as Genesee Street).<ref name="then"/>

The larger, [[Clinton Square]], the city's town center located to the west, had developed first, however, following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, commercial and retail activity spread along Genesee Street to Hanover Square.<ref name="then"/>

===Public square===

When [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] was still a village, the village well was located in '''Hanover Square'''. 

In the 1820s, a group of shops called the ''Hanover Arcade'' were located where the [[State Tower Building]] now stands.<ref name="then">{{cite web|url=http://syracusethenandnow.org/Dwntwn/HanoverSq/HanoverSquare.htm |title=Hanover Square |accessdate=December 5, 2010 |first= |last= |publisher=Syracuse Then and Now, 2010}}</ref>

The buildings on Water Street were backed by the [[Erie Canal]], and were known as <U+201C>double-enders.<U+201D> This facilitated the unloading of goods from barges on the canal. [[American Civil War|Civil War]] recruiting booths were set up in the square, and were made into a huge bonfire at the end of the war.<ref name ="nrhptext"/><ref name = "Downtown"/>

===Commercial center===

{{See also|Clinton Square}}

[[Image:Veterans-park 1900.jpg<U+200E>|left|thumb|180px|Veteran's Park in Syracuse, New York about 1900 at night]]

The first buildings in the square were a church and several wooden structures which were both residential and commercial. 

In March 1834, the area was devastated by fire which destroyed all the buildings on the north side of the square, next to the canal. That same year, the buildings were replaced with narrow, brick structures in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style of architecture and known as the ''Phoenix Buildings'' four of which still stand today on the northern edge of the square.<ref name="then"/>

Later in 1834, the owners of the wooden buildings on the south side of the square erected a similar row of brick buildings along East Genesee Street known as the Franklin buildings. The area was soon known as [[Franklin Square, Syracuse|Franklin Square]]. Three of the buildings are still standing today.<ref name="then"/>

Similar to [[Clinton Square]], the public space became an "important center" of social and political life in the city with its "public meetings, demonstrations and partisan speeches." After 1840, the railroad brought additional commerce to the intersection.<ref name="then"/>

In 1865, after [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s funeral procession traveled through Syracuse on the way to [[Springfield, Illinois]], thousands came to the square to hear eulogies for the former president.<ref name="then"/>

===Transportation hub===

Hanover Square has played a vital role in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse's]] commercial development. At one time, banks and theaters lined the square which was originally known as Veteran's Park. Throughout the years, the square served as a transportation hub for railroads and trolleys and was a busy commercial center.<ref name = "parks"/>

At one time, the square served as a "hack stand" where drivers would hire out their wagons to local merchants. For years, many pedestrians, especially women, complained that they could not safely travel from one side of the square to the other due to the standing carts, mud and moving vehicles.<ref name="then"/>

===Historic district===

Listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1976, the square is an intact, mainly nineteenth century historic district.<ref name = "Downtown"/>

The square is a ''National Register Historic District'' and a ''Local Preservation District'' whose buildings represent over 100 years of architecture and was the firsr in the city on the register.<ref name = "parks"/>

Hanover Square has changed little since the [[Civil War]]. Several of the buildings date to the period that ran from 1830 through 1860. Newer buildings date to the late 19th century, such as the [[Onondaga County Savings Bank]] which was constructed in 1896.<ref name="then"/>

== Hanover Square Historic District contributing Properties ==

The 17 properties can by visited in order, starting at South Salina Street and Water Street, going east on Water Street, turning south on Warren Street, and returning on the diagonal along East Genesee Street to Water Street.<ref name="then"/>

The buildings in the square encompass a myriad of architectural styles building over a period of several years including; [[Federal architecture|Federal]], [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Sullivanesque]], [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]], [[Neo-classical architecture|Neo-classical]] and [[Art Deco]] are all represented.<ref name="then"/>
