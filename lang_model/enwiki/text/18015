'''Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|<U+1F08><U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03BE><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0394><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+03A6><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B8><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03C0><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}}}) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] nobleman and notable general. A relative of the ruling [[Palaiologos dynasty]], he was appointed commander-in-chief in [[Asia Minor]] in 1293 and for a time re-established the Byzantine position there, scoring some of the last Byzantine successes against the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish emirates]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|p=349}}.</ref> In 1295 he rose up in revolt against [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], but was betrayed and blinded. Nothing is known of him until 1323, when he was pardoned by Andronikos II and sent again against the Turks, relieving a siege of [[Alasehir|Philadelphia]], allegedly by his mere appearance. He was then named briefly governor of [[Lesbos]] in 1328, and again in 1336, when he recovered the island's capital from [[Latins#Middle Ages|Latin]] occupation. He ruled the island thereafter, probably until his death in the 1340s.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Alexios was born circa 1270 as the second son of ''[[protovestiarios|pr<U+014D>tovestiarios]]'' and ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[Michael Tarchaneiotes]]. His mother, whose name is unknown, belonged to the noble family of the [[Philanthropenoi]], which rose to prominence in the latter half of the 13th century.<ref name="ODB"/> She was the daughter of ''[[protostrator|pr<U+014D>tostrat<U+014D>r]]'' and ''[[megas doux]]'' [[Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos]], after whom Alexios was named.<ref name="PLP">PLP 29752</ref> On his father's side, Alexios was also closely related to the imperial family of the [[Palaiologoi]], through his grandmother, Martha Palaiologina, a sister of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259<U+2013>1261).<ref name="PLP"/><ref>{{harvnb|Angelov|2007|p=122}}.</ref> Alexios married Theodora Akropolitissa, daughter of [[Constantine Akropolites]] and granddaughter of the historian [[George Akropolites]]. They had one child, Michael Philanthropenos, who also became a general.<ref name="PLP"/>

===First command in Asia and uprising===
[[File:Andronikos II Palaiologos (head).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Miniature portrait of Andronikos II Palaiologos]]
Alexios's uncle, Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282<U+2013>1328), took an active interest in the defence of the Anatolian possessions of the Byzantine Empire against the encroaching Turkic emirates in the early 1290s: hoping to re-establish the ''[[akritai]]'', he settled refugees from [[Venetian Crete|Venetian-held Crete]] in military colonies along the border and appointed Alexios as ''[[dux|doux]]'' of the [[Thracesian theme]], awarding him the high court title of ''[[pinkernes|pinkern<U+0113>s]]''.<ref name="ODB">{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1649}}.</ref><ref name=Bartusis74>{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|p=74}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nicol|1993|pp=123<U+2013>124}}.</ref>  

Alexios commanded all of the Byzantine possessions in Asia, except for the [[Ionia]]n coast, but his main area of responsibility was the interior of the old [[Thracesian Theme]], which comprised the southeastern parts of Byzantine Anatolia. A certain Libadarios deputized for him in the northern provinces ([[Neokastra]]).<ref name=Nicol124>{{harvnb|Nicol|1993|p=124}}.</ref> During the next two years, Alexios achieved several victories: he defeated the Turks of [[Mysia]] at [[Achyraous]] and forced them to recognize Byzantine rule, and then moved south.<ref name="PLP"/> Based at [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]], he scoured the valley of the [[Menderes River|Maeander river]], managing to stop the Turkish raids and advance into the Emirate of [[Menteshe]], recapturing the fortress of Melanoudion, the town of [[Didyma|Hieron]], and rid [[Miletus]] of the payment of tribute to the Turks.<ref name="PLP"/><ref name=Nicol124/> Many Turks, fleeing from [[Mongols|Mongol]] pressure, joined his army,<ref name="PLP"/> and so many prisoners were made during his campaigns, that the monk and scholar [[Maximus Planudes]], a friend of Alexios, wrote that "a sheep was more expensive to buy than a Muslim prisoner".<ref name=Bartusis74/> His successes made him popular with the locals, who reportedly began suggesting that he should make himself emperor. Philanthropenos at first refused to heed them and even asked Andronikos to transfer him away from Anatolia, but in vain.<ref name=Nicol124/> In mid-1294, Philanthropenos was ordered by the emperor to transfer the region of [[Lydia]] to Libadarios's control.<ref name="PLP"/> In summer 1295, while Philanthropenos was at [[Tralleis]], a Turkish general named Karman used the opportunity to launch an attack on [[Priene]], but was beaten back with heavy losses, and Philanthropenos's troops recovered Hieron.<ref name="PLP"/>

[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of Asia Minor ca. 1300, showing the Turkish encroachment on Byzantine territory following Philanthropenos' departure]]
At this point, in the autumn of 1295, Alexios rose up against Andronikos. The exact circumstances and reasons for this move remain obscure, but the revolt was fuelled by the discontent of the Asian provinces over high taxation and what many perceived as the neglect of the defence of Asia by the Palaiologoi.<ref name=Bartusis74/> His rebellion certainly had the support of the people: as [[George Pachymeres]] recounts, "in the monasteries [..], the name of the Emperor was no longer commemorated, but only that of Philanthropenos."<ref name=Nicol124/> At [[Ephesus]] Alexios seized Theodore Palaiologos, the Emperor's brother, but failed to gain the support of all provincial governors; Libadarios, most notably, who was also Theodore's father-in-law, remained loyal to Andronikos.<ref name=Nicol124/> Negotiations began, with Andronikos offering Alexios the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' to lull him into a false sense of security, while he prepared to get rid of him. Around Christmas, Libadarios persuaded some Cretan soldiers to seize Alexios and had him blinded, the [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|punishment usually meted]] out to rebels.<ref name=Nicol124/><ref name=Bartusis74/>

===Rehabilitation and rescue of Philadelphia===
Alexios was replaced as commander by [[John Tarchaneiotes]], first cousin of Andronikos II,<ref>{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|p=75}}.</ref> and disappeared from the scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Jesaias of Constantinople|Jesaias]] urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324.<ref name=Nicol158>{{harvnb|Nicol|1993|p=158}}.</ref> Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated [[exclave]] of [[Ala<U+015F>ehir|Philadelphia]], which had been long under siege and was ready to fall.<ref name=Nicol158/> He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted.<ref name="PLP"/><ref>{{harvnb|Bartusis|1997|p=88}}.</ref> Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.<ref>{{harvnb|Radivoj|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBody.aspx?lemmaid=7176 Chapter 4.1]}}.</ref>

===Governor of Lesbos===
Philanthropenos remained at Philadelphia until 1326, possibly also 1327, but it appears that he was then appointed as governor of the strategically important Byzantine island of [[Lesbos]], since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]].<ref name="PLP"/>

In 1335, Lesbos was seized by a Latin army under the Genoese Lord of [[Phocaea]], [[Domenico Cattaneo]], and Andronikos III raised a fleet of 83 ships to recover the island, which arrived in June 1336.<ref name=Radivoj4.2>{{harvnb|Radivoj|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBody.aspx?lemmaid=7176 Chapter 4.2]}}.</ref> The fleet disembarked an army, led by Alexios Philanthropenos, which swiftly secured the entire island except for the capital, [[Mytilene]].<ref name=Radivoj4.2/> Philanthropenos countered the strong garrison of 500 Latin mercenaries by inducing them, group by group, to come over to him.<ref name="PLP"/> The siege lasted until November, when Domenico capitulated, returning Lesbos and Phocaea to the Empire.<ref name=Radivoj4.2/> In the next year, Philanthropenos was able to thwart a Turkish attack on the island by bribing the Turks.<ref name="PLP"/> Exuberantly praised by contemporaries like [[Nikephoros Gregoras]] as the "[[Belisarius]] of the [[Palaiologan era]]", Alexios Philanthropenos was left by Andronikos III as governor of the island, where he lived until his death, which occurred probably in the 1340s.<ref name=Radivoj4.2/>
