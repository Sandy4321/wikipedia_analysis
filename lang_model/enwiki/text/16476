This is a '''list of Orkney islands''' in [[Scotland]]. The [[Orkney]] archipelago is located 16&nbsp;kilometres (10&nbsp;miles) north of mainland [[Scotland]] and comprises over 70 islands and [[skerry|skerries]], of which 20 are inhabited. In addition to the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]] there are three groups of islands. The North and South Isles lie respectively north and south of Mainland. The [[Pentland Skerries]] are a group of small islands in the [[Pentland Firth]], a dangerous stretch of water between mainland Scotland and the larger islands of Orkney, through which run the strongest tidal streams in Britain.<ref>Lawrence, Martin (2003) ''The Yachtsman's Pilot: North and East Scotland''. St Ives. Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson, p. 108.</ref>

The definition of an island used in this list is that it is 'land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways'.<ref>Various other definitions are used in the Scottish context. For example the General Register Office for Scotland define an island as 'a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland' but although they include islands linked by bridges etc. this is not clear from this definition. Haswell-Smith (2004) ''Scottish Islands'' uses 'an Island is a piece of land or group of pieces of land which is entirely surrounded by water at Lowest Astronomical Tide and to which there is no permanent means of dry access'. This is widely agreed to be unhelpful as it consciously excludes bridged islands.</ref> There are four islands joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of [[causeway]]s known as the [[Churchill Barriers]]. They are [[South Ronaldsay]], [[Burray]], [[Lamb Holm]] and [[Glims Holm]]. In addition, [[Hunda]] is connected to Burray by a causeway.<ref>Ordnance Survey maps call Glims Holm 'Glimps Holm'. Lamb Holm and Glims Holm are also occasionally referred to as 'Lambholm' and 'Glimsholm'. See for example Wenham, Sheena "The South Isles", in Omand (2003) ''op cit'', p. 210.</ref> The barriers were constructed by Italian [[prisoners-of-war]] as a means of preventing enemy [[submarine]] access to the vast natural harbour of [[Scapa Flow]] after the sinking of [[HMS Royal Oak]] by a [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]] in 1939 with the loss of 883 lives. The Italian prisoners constructed a small [[Roman Catholic]] [[Italian Chapel|chapel]] on Lamb Holm as a place of worship during their incarceration.<ref>Wenham, Sheena "Modern Times" in Omand (2003) ''op cit'', pp. 108-9.</ref>

Most of the islands have a bedrock formed from [[Old Red Sandstone]], which is circa 400 million years old, and was laid down in the [[Devonian]] period.<ref>McKirdy, Alan Gordon, John & Crofts, Roger (2007) ''Land of Mountain and Flood: The Geology and Landforms of Scotland''. Edinburgh. Birlinn.</ref> The islands have good agricultural qualities and have been continuously inhabited for thousands of years,<ref>[http://walking.visitscotland.com/walks/orkneyshetland/ "Walk in Scotland: Orkney and Shetland"] Visit Scotland. Retrieved [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref> as evidenced by the [[World Heritage Site]] of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]]. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous [[lighthouse]]s as an aid to navigation.<ref>[http://www.nlb.org.uk/ourlights/library.htm "Lighthouse Library"] Northern Lighthouse Board. Retrieved [[14 July]] [[2007]].</ref> The European Marine Energy Centre, which is located at [[Stromness]], is currently testing various [[wave power|wave]] and [[tidal energy]] devices from Billia Croo on the Mainland and [[Eday]].<ref>[http://www.emec.org.uk/ "EMEC Orkney"] European Marine Energy Centre. Retrieved [[3 February]] [[2007]].</ref> The islands all fall within the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands Council]] area. Most of the larger islands have [[development trust]]s that support the local economy.<ref>[http://www.dtascot.org.uk/products.cfm "Directory of Members'] DTA Scotland. Retrieved [[15 July]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://www.orkneytoday.co.uk/news_item.asp?newsItem=2287 "Orkney Communities are doing it for themselves"] ([[23 August]] [[2007]] ''et seq'')  ''Orkney Today''.

This is a list of islands with an area greater than 15 hectares (approximately 37 acres). Records for the last date of settlement for the smaller uninhabited islands are incomplete, but all of the islands listed here would have been inhabited at some point during the [[Neolithic]], [[Picts|Pictish]] or [[Viking|Norse]] periods.  

'Ward Hill' or a variant thereof is very common as the name of the highest point on the island. These locations are named after those high places used for the lighting of [[beacon|warning beacons]].<ref>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/placenames/pl-root.htm "Orkney Placenames - natural elements"] Orkneyjar.
