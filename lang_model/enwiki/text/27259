The '''LASALLE College of the Arts''' ({{zh-s|s=<U+62C9><U+8428><U+5C14><U+827A><U+672F><U+5B66><U+9662>}}), formerly ''LASALLE-SIA College of the Arts'', is an [[arts]] [[educational institution]] in [[Singapore]]. It was founded in [[1984]] by [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle]] brother, Brother Joseph McNally. Presently, LASALLE has five faculties which are [[design]], [[fine arts]], [[integrated arts]], [[media arts]] and [[performing arts]].

==Relocation and new facilities==

LASALLE College of the Arts has now moved to its new home in the heart of Singapore. Located in the Rochor area, bounded by Prinsep Street, Short Street and Albert Street, the new City Campus sits on a one-hectare site, which is part of the area designated as the Arts, Culture, Learning and Entertainment hub of Singapore. 

One of the features of this new Campus is the Brother Joseph McNally Museum. It tells the story of Brother Joseph McNally, the founder of the College and the history of LASALLE. It houses Brother Joseph McNally's preserved studio, tools, benches and unfinished work. It also contains a Live studio for alumni and resident artists, as well as having interactive audio and visual presentations and permanent and occasional exhibitions.

== Renaming ==
In recognising LASALLE<U+2019>s aim to be a Singaporean brand name recognised globally in creative arts education, research and practice, it was agreed with [[Singapore Airlines]] (SIA) that the word "SIA" would be phased out of the institution<U+2019>s name and  be branded simply as "LASALLE" by end of February 2007.

The Main Theatre at New City Campus will be named The Singapore Airlines Theatre.  The Singapore Airlines Theatre symbolises the warm relations between the two institutions that began in 1993 when SIA contributed S$15 million to fund the  construction of two buildings at LASALLE<U+2019>s Goodman Road campus.

== Musical Theatre Programme ==

LASALLE<U+2019>s Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Musical Theatre Programme began with its first intake of students in July 2004. The course, the first of its kind in Asia, trains students in singing, acting and dancing. In addition to local teachers, the course also invites international guest artists including writers, directors, agents, and casting directors to contribute to the teaching programme. Final-year students also have the opportunity to present their talent to invited international agents, casting directors, producers and theatre companies in Graduation Showcases in Melbourne, Sydney and Singapore.

==Accreditation==

LASALLE-SIA received its Accredited Institution status granted by [[The Open University]], the UK<U+2019>s largest university, in March 2004. The institutional accreditation and degree validation by The Open University Validation Services (OUVS) is an independent stamp of approval of academic quality from an internationally-recognised accrediting body operating under a UK Royal Charter. Students completing degree programmes written and developed by LASALLE and validated by OUVS will receive a parchment jointly bearing the name and seal of LASALLE and [[The Open University]], clearly identifying LASALLE-SIA as the provider and The Open University bring validation equivalent to UK MA, BA (Hons) or DipHE (Diploma in Higher Education).
