"'''A New Day in the Old Town'''" is the season premiere and first [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and the twenty-first episode overall. It was written by co-creator [[J.J. Abrams]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Akiva Goldsman]], with Goldsman also directing. The episode followed the aftermath of Olivia's journey to the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in the [[There's More Than One of Everything|last season's finale]], while also introducing the idea of [[shapeshifter]]s. It guest starred actors [[Luke Goss]], [[Ari Graynor]], [[Meghan Markle]], and [[Tegan Moss]].

It first aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 17, 2009 to generally positive reviews. It was watched by an estimated 9.96 million viewers, and received a 2.43 ratings share among viewers 18-49.

==Plot==
A mysterious man involved in a downtown [[Manhattan]] collision with a SUV flees the scene to a nearby apartment building. He enters the building and attacks a random man, hooking up equipment to the man's inner mouth, which allows him to adopt his external appearance and [[shapeshifter|shapeshift]]. The crashed SUV is discovered to be [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]]'s ([[Anna Torv]]), though she is not inside. [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) and [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) arrive and investigate the scene while being accosted by a new junior agent, Amy Jessup ([[Meghan Markle]]), who wonders what they do for the FBI. After Walter searches through the SUV, he shuts the door and Olivia suddenly ejects through the windshield. She is rushed to the hospital and declared [[brain death|brain dead]]. Peter and Broyles ([[Lance Reddick]]) drink at a bar together in sorrow, and Broyles reveals the Fringe Division is being shut down because of their failure to provide "usable results". Suspicious and curious of Fringe Division, Jessup begins a personal investigation into their past activities.

After talking to Rachel about her sister, Peter visits Olivia, who is scheduled to be taken off [[life support]] the following morning. However, Olivia suddenly wakes up, crying the [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase ''Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy''. She does not remember getting injured, and incoherently tells Peter there is something they need to do, and their "lives may depend on it," but cannot remember who told her this, or why. Peter tries to enter the FBI building, but is denied until Jessup agrees to accompany him. She questions him about Fringe Division, and they begin investigating the driver who hit Olivia. 
When they arrive at his apartment, they discover what appears to be the driver's body, but he has been dead longer than when the accident took place.

The shapeshifted man makes contact with his group via typewriter, and is told his mission to prevent a "meeting" was unsuccessful, as Olivia is still alive. He is told to interrogate her, and then kill her. Meanwhile, Peter introduces Jessup to their lab at [[Harvard]], and upon performing an autopsy on the man found in the apartment, they find three holes in the roof of his mouth. Walter shows them archived footage of one of his 1970s experiments of a drugged up girl who says she sees shapechanging soldiers from an [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that can "look like any of us".

After being visited by her partner, Agent [[Charlie Francis (Fringe)|Charlie Francis]] ([[Kirk Acevedo]]) and given a gun, Olivia is unsuccessfully questioned by the shapeshifter, who has adopted the appearance of a female nurse. The nurse attempts to kill Olivia, but is shot and flees from Jessup. Peter, Charlie, and Jessup follow her into nearby tunnels, but the nurse manages to kill Charlie and secretly shapeshift into him. Peter returns to Olivia, and tells her the Greek phrase means "be a better person than his father," and was told to him every night by his mother.

After being told by a panel of Senators that Fringe is not worth the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the transformation device by Peter so Broyles can justify Fringe Division remaining active. The final scene shows the shapeshifted Charlie disposing of the real agent's body.

 | quote  = "Well, the first episode is sort of meant to kind of reset things, and for those who have never seen the show, offer a way in. It has the advantage of being almost better than the pilot. You never have to have seen the show to see the first episode and hopefully get sucked in. So what happens in the very beginning, this crazy sort of situation that she finds herself in is in a sense meant to be the premise for what this year is about. So what you're asking is really what happens over the course of the whole second season".

In June 2009, Fox put out a casting call for several new characters for the second season. One of these, Lloyd Parr, was described as a guest star in "his 30<U+2019>s to early 50<U+2019>s, an average guy. We need a strong character actor who can play hyper-competent.

"A New Day in the Old Town" was written by co-creator [[J. J. Abrams]] and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, with Goldsman also directing.<ref name=mtv/> The producers considered screening the first part of the season premiere at [[Comic-Con]] in [[San Diego]], but ultimately decided against it because they thought the scene "ends in such an exciting way that we were afraid to let it out".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/interviews/2009/07/28/live-at-the-san-diego-comic-con-fringe-32144/20090725_fringe/ |title=Live at the San Diego Comic-Con: "Fringe" |work=The Futon Critic |last=Ford Sullivan|first=Brian|date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> As a promotion, Fox did send out a piece of paper along with a "screener" of the premiere to certain journalists.

Co-executive producer [[Jeff Pinkner]] considered beginning the second season directly after first season's final scene between Olivia and William Bell, but changed his mind because he thought it would be more interesting to show how Olivia's disappearance and reappearance affected the Fringe team, as well as the rest of the season.<ref name=analyze/> The scene between Olivia and Bell is consequently not shown until the season's fourth episode, "[[Momentum Deferred]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/momentum-deferred,33885/ |title="Momentum Deferred" |publisher=[[A.V.

The production team used new technology called a "breakway windshield," as well as air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a "[[catapult]]". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene was ready to be shot. She wore a small backpad, a [[mouthguard]], and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" because of the lack of problems.<ref name=analyze>{{cite video |people=[[Joshua Jackson]], [[Anna Torv]], [[Jeff Pinkner]], [[Akiva Goldsman]], [[John Noble]], Greg Zenon, Michael Mitchell, Bob Comer, Melissa Stubbs |date=2010 |title=Analyzing the Scene for "A New Day in the Old Town"| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe: The Complete Second Season'' Disc 1 }}</ref>

It was also more than 25 percent lower than its average audience from the first season. These lower ratings have been attributed to a lower-rated lead-in (''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', instead of the previous season's ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''), and tough competition from [[CBS]]'s ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''.<ref name=airlockalpharatings>{{cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/node/6709 |title='Fringe' Stumbles In Season 2 Premiere |work=[[Airlock Alpha]] |last=Hinman |first=Michael |date=2010-09-18 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref> The rest of the season's ratings would continue to stay lower than the previous season, leading many to question Fox's decision to move the show in the first place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b149812_should_fox_have_messed_with_fringe.html |title=Should Fox Have Messed With Fringe?  |work=[[E!|E!

Critical reviews of the episode were generally positive. Hilary Rothing from ''[[UGO Networks]]'' enjoyed the perceived parallels to ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'' and praised the further development of [[Anna Torv]]'s character Olivia; "With tonight's premiere, the writing feels tighter, the pace is fast but not so much so that the story begins to trip over itself - and if that's any indication of how the rest of the season shapes up, then FOX will have my full attention every Thursday from 9-10pm".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/fringe-a-new-day-in-the-old-town-review |title=Fringe - "A New Day In The Old Town" Review |work=[[UGO Networks]]|last=Rothing |first=Hilary|date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> Noel Murray from [[A.V.
