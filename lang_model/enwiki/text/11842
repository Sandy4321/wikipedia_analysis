The '''Wargames Research Group''' '''(WRG)''' is a British [[List of wargame publishers|publisher of rules]]  and reference material for [[miniature wargaming]]. Founded in 1969 they were the premier publisher of tabletop rules during the seventies and eighties, publishing rules for periods ranging from ancient times to modern armoured warfare, and reference books which are still considered standard works for amateur researchers and wargamers. They are best known for their seminal ancient period rules, and also for [[De Bellis Antiquitatis]] and [[Hordes of the Things (game)|Hordes of the Things]] fantasy rules. 

==History==

WRG was founded by Phil Barker, Bob O'Brien, and Ed Smith in 1969, when they published ''War Game Rules: 1000 B.C. to 500 A.D.''.<ref>[http://www.wrg.me.uk/WRG/wrg.html History of the Wargames Research Group]</ref>

The rules quickly gained widespread acceptance through he miniature wargaming world, espcially in the UK, and quickly became the acknowledged standard for ancient warfare. WRG followed with rules for other periods which gained similar widespread acceptance.

Innovative features of the rules included:
* morale rules, based on a reaction test which evaluated the tactical situation of a unit as well as the casualties it had suffered . The results of the reaction test could result in players losing control of their troops <ref>[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~beattie/timeline2.html Courier timeline of wargaming development, 1969]</ref>
* nominal 1:20 figure scale, so that one wargames figure represented 20 men, allowing casualties to be inflicted without necessarily having to remove figures.<ref>[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~beattie/timeline2.html Courier timeline of wargaming development, 1969]</ref>

WRG rules have been sufficiently widely adopted that other popular rule sets sometimes choose to adopt the same basing requirements for figures to avoid requiring rebasing of the the large number of WRG-based armies.  <ref>[http://www.hutchs-wargames.co.uk/Rules/ancientsquick.pdf Ancient Warfare Fast Play Rules (2002)]</ref><ref>[http://warflute.org/intro_A2_en.php Review of Armati rules]</ref><ref>[http://classicalhack.com/article/figures/0007/2/ Classical Hack uses "the standard basing size used by international tournament gamers" - ie WRG basing]</ref><ref>[http://www.onmilitarymatters.com/wcat0900.htm see Ancient Warfare, Medieval Warfare, Renaissance Warfare, Classical Hack, Holy Hack]</ref>

At the beginning of the 1990s WRG introduced  [[De Bellis Antiquitatis]] (DBA) which was a radical simplification of ancients wargaming. The concepts of DBA were adapted to allow significantly larger games, which lead to  [[DBM De Bellis Multitudinis|De Bellis Multitudinis]] (DBM) for Ancients and [[De Bellis Renationis]] (DBR) for Renaissance. The DBx series of rules are still in widespread use, the latest incarnation being De Bellis Magistrorum Militum ([[DBMM]]). 

DBA was also adapted to a fantasy setting in [[Hordes of the Things (game)|Hordes of the Things]].

== Significance ==

WRG rules were a significant milestone in the development of modern miniature wargaming,<ref>[http://www.costik.com/paphist.html History of Paper Gaming]</ref> and attempted to  use [[Historical method|historical research]] to provide historical realism in wargames.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Thus, the WRG referred to the original historical texts as the basis for their reference works, rules sets and army lists<ref>[http://www.ancientbattles.com/AtG/WAB%20AlexanderMaterials%20FAQ%20v.1.2.htm Phil Barker and Richard Bodley Scott, D.B.M. Army Lists recommended for Warhammer Ancient Battles]</ref>, and their historical publications are often found in wargaming<ref>[http://www.ancientbattles.com/AtG/WAB%20AlexanderMaterials%20FAQ%20v.1.2.htm Duncan Head, Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars, 359 BC to 146 BC, recommended on a Warhammer Ancient Battles page]</ref>, and other bibliographies.<ref>[http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/hywbib.htm#general Heath, Ian. Armies of the Middle Ages, volume 1; The Hundred Years War, the Wars of the Roses and the Burgundian Wars, 1300-1487 on the Hundred Years War bibliography page]</ref><ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/sloan.html The Stirrup Controversy, John Sloan]</ref> <ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rrice/milbib96.html Warfleets of Antiquity, Classics 175, University of Pennsylvania]</ref>

The reference works published by WRG are aimed at the wargamer rather than the academic history student, but are nonetheless accurate enough to be occasionally cited in more scholarly texts.
