Some of the questions relating to the philosophy of music are:

* What, exactly is music (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for it)?
* What is the relationship between music and emotion?

[[Peter Kivy]], Professor of Philosophy at [[Rutgers University]], in particular, sets out to argue how music, which is one of the non-representational forms of art, can envoke particular emotional experiences.
