<blockquote> Staffing is the process of acquiring, deploying, and retaining a workforce of sufficient quantity

and quality to create positive impacts on the organization<U+2019>s effectiveness.</blockquote>

According to this model:
''Aquisition'' comprises the recuitment processes leading to the emplyment of staff. It includes [[human resource planning]] to identify what the organisation requires in terms of the numbers of employees needed and their atributes (knowledge, skills and abilities) in order to effectively meet job requirements. In addition the selection techniques and methods of assessment to identify the most suitable candidates for a particular job.

''Deployment'' involves decisions about how those recruited will be allocated to specific roles according to business demands. It also concerns the subsequent appointment to more advanced jobs through internal recruitment, promotion or reorganisation.

''Retention'' deals with the management of the outflow of employees from an organisation. This includes both managing voluntary activites such as resignation, and controlling involuntary measures whereby employees are managed out of the organisation through redundancy programmes or other types of dismissal. The overriding objective is to minimise the loss from the organisation of valued employees through strategic and tactical measures whilst enabling the organisation to reduce employment costs where circumstances dictate.

 

Staffing is also used in a specific sense to refer to the management of employee schedules.
