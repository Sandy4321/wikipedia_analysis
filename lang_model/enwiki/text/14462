'''Chauncey Peak''', {{convert|688|ft|m|0|lk=on}}, is a [[traprock]] mountain located 2mi (3.2k) northeast of the center of [[Meriden, Connecticut]]. It is part of the narrow, linear [[Metacomet Ridge]] that extends from [[Long Island Sound]] near [[New Haven, Connecticut]], north through the [[Connecticut River Valley]] of [[Massachusetts]] to the [[Vermont]] border. Chauncey Peak is known for its scenic vistas, vertical cliff faces overlooking Crescent Lake, unique [[microclimate]] ecosystems, and rare plant communities. It rises steeply {{convert|400|ft|m|0|lk=on}} above the city of Meriden to the south with west-facing cliffs that plunge into Crescent Lake {{convert|300|ft|m|0|lk=on}} below. 
The mountain is traversed by the 50 mile [[Mattabesett Trail]]. <ref name="EF">Farnsworth, Elizabeth J.

==Geography==
Roughly .75 mi (1.2k) in diameter, Chauncey Peak is located within the town of [[Meriden, Connecticut]]. Although Chauncey Peak is described by some sources as part of Lamentation Mountain,<ref name="GP">[http://www.visitnewhaven.com/pdfs/trails/Meriden/TrailMapGuiffridaPark.pdf ''Giuffrida Park.''] PDF brochure. South Central Regional Counci of Governments. North Haven, Connecticut. Undated. Cited Dec. 17, 2007.
</ref> it rises more than {{convert|300|ft|m|0|lk=on}} above the common gap between the two, making it its own mountain by regional standards (see [[Four-thousand footers]]). Crescent Lake, (formerly called Bradley Hubbard Reservoir), lies nestled  between Lamentation Mountain and Chauncey Peak. The lake provides emergency drinking water to the city of Meriden. Much of the east side of the mountain has been subject to [[quarrying]]; as of 2007, the quarry was .5mi (.8k) wide, roughly 3/4ths the width of the entire mountain. [[Interstate 91]] cuts through the gap between Higby Mountain and [[Chauncey Peak]] to the north.<ref>Google Earth. Sat. images of region. Cited Dec. 20, 2007</ref><ref name="GP"/> 

The Metacomet Ridge continues north from Chauncey Peak to become [[Lamentation Mountain]] and south to become [[Higby Mountain]]. The western half of Chauncey Peak drains into the [[Quinnipiac River]], then to Long Island Sound; the eastern half to the Mattabesett River, thence to the [[Connecticut River]] and Long Island Sound.<Ref name="D">Delorme Topo 6.0.

==Geology and environment==
The origin of the Metacomet Ridge dates back 200 million years ago with the rifting apart of [[North America]] from [[Eurasia]] in the process that would ultimately create the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In the area that is now the Metacomet Ridge and surrounding sedimentary rock basin, massive basalt (traprock) [[lava]] flows spread across the prehistoric [[rift valley]], some of them several hundred feet thick, over a period of 20 million years.  Sediment accumulated between lava flows and lithified into [[sedimentary rock]].  After the rifting processes ceased, layers of strata faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent [[erosion]], [[glaciation]], and uplift exposed the weather resistant edge of the traprock lava sheets, creating the Metacomet Ridge as it is today. The mineral content and the shape of the ridge make possible a variety of microclimate ecosystems. Hot and dry cliff faces support plant and animal species uncommon so far north. Deeply gouged ravines support cooler climate species found in more northerly climes, while gradual backslope environments support species typical of the surrounding latitude. Talus slopes beneath cliffs accumulate minerals that support [[alkaline]]-loving plant species uncommon in surrounding [[acidic]] southern New England. Extensive cliffs provide ideal habitat and important migration corridors for [[raptor]] species.<ref name="EF"/><ref> Raymo, Chet and Maureen E.

==Recreation and conservation==
[[Image:Ct chaucey quarry.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Quarry on the east side of Chauncey Peak. 2000 photo; more rock has been removed since.]]The west side of Chauncey Peak lies within [[Giuffrida Park]], managed by the city of Meriden. The park boasts a lake, golf course, woodlands, and the rocky peaks of Lamentation Mountain and Chauncey Peak. Permitted activities within the park include [[hiking]], [[snowshoeing]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[picnicking]], and [[bicycling]]. [[Swimming]], [[boating]], [[rock climbing]], and [[fishing]] are prohibited. The park supports a number of trails, most notably the {{dist mile km|50}} Mattabesett Trail (maintained by the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]]), which stretches from the northern end of Lamentation Mountain, south to [[Totoket Mountain]] and north again to the Connecticut River.<ref name="GP"/><ref name="CWB"/> 

The ecosystem and ridgeline of Chauncey Peak is most threatened by quarrying, although the west side of the peak, within Giuffrida Park, is protected. In 2000, Chauncey Peak was included in a study by the [[National Park Service]] for the designation of a new [[National Scenic Trail]] now tentatively called the [[New England National Scenic Trail]], which would include the [[Metacomet-Monadnock Trail]] in Massachusetts and the [[Mattabesett Trail]] and [[Metacomet Trail]] trails in Connecticut.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1528: U.S. Congress ''New England National Scenic Trail Designation Act.'']</ref><ref name="EF"/>
