The game was never released outside of Japan.

==Gameplay==
The game's protagonist enters Tokimeki High School and runs into a girl wearing glasses who looks identical to Miho Nakayama. Though the game is a standard text command-style [[adventure game]] similar to the [[Famicom Tantei Club]] series, in important scenes, the player is required to select a facial expression in addition to a verbal response. The four expressions (straight face, laughter, sadness, anger) must match the content of the response being given, and any incorrect responses immediately lead to the "game over" screen. This increased the game's difficulty considerably in comparison to other [[text adventure game]]s where there were fewer incorrect choices. Some scenes specifically require that the dialogue not match with the expression. For instance, choosing a dialogue expressing joy with a straight face may be the correct choice in a certain situation because it represents a deeper level of emotion and thought on the part of the protagonist. This system allowed the game to simulate a level of complexity resembling actual love relationships, leading to its classification as a [[dating simulation]] rather than an adventure game. The game has two different endings, depending on the choices made during the game, and the prizes receivable via the Disk Fax network differed for each ending.

===Features===
''Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School'' was the first [[bish<U+014D>jo game]] featuring a [[Japanese idol]]. [[Miho Nakayama]], a popular actor and singer in Japan during the 1980s, is featured on the game's cover and makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the game itself. It was the third game compatible with the [[Disk Fax]] network of the Disk System, and uses a blue floppy disk instead of the regular yellow disk. Though most compatible games used the Disk Fax network to upload [[high score]]s or [[time trial]]s onto the official rankings system, ''Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School'' was the only game where players used the network to register that they had completed the game to receive [[prize]]s. The game also contained a phone number which players could call to hear hints concerning the gameplay or listen to a personal message voiced by Miho Nakayama herself. This phone service ended shortly after the release of the game, and the messages and hints are displayed in text form in subsequent versions of the game.
