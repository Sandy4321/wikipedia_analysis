'''Mark Manders''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[artist]]. He was born in [[1968]] in Volkel, [[The Netherlands]]. 

'''Manders''''s body of work consists mainly of [[installations]], [[drawings]], [[sculptures]] and [[short films]].He manages to turn everyday objects into something bizarre, alienated from their usual context and environment. At the same time these estranged items evoke a sense of power. 
He places random objects, such as tables, chairs, light bulbs, blankets and dead animals, in an almost religious configuration and thus provides these objects with some sort of sacred aura. '''Manders'''<U+2019> calls these installations his <U+201C>Self-portrait as a Building<U+201D>. The installations are representations of his own thoughts and ideas, and invite the spectator to decipher both the secret of the work, as of the artist himself.  
 
In 2003 [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] in [[Munich]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in co-operation with the Renaissance Society have organized solo-exhibitions of his work. 
In 2004, he was selected for the Manifesta Biennale in [[San Sebastian]] (ES). In 2005, the solo-project "Matrix 214: The Absence of Mark Manders" was held at the [[Berkeley Art Museum]] in [[California]] (US) and another solo show "Parallel Occurrence" has run at [[IMMA]] [[Dublin]]. For 2007, '''Manders''' is invited by several venues around the world to have a solo show, for instance New Museum in [[New York]] (US), Kunstverein Hannover (DE), Kunsthaus Z<U+00FC>rich (CH) and S.M.A.K. in [[Ghent]] (BE).
