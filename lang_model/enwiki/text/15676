'''Comedy''' was one of two principal dramatic forms in ancient Greece, the other being [[tragedy]]. Athenian comedy is conventionally divided into three periods, ''Old Comedy'', ''Middle Comedy'', and ''New Comedy''. Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while  Middle Comedy is largely lost, i.e. preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]. New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of [[Menander]].

[[C. A. Trypanis]] wrote that Comedy is the last of the great species of poetry Greece gave to the world.<ref>Cf. Trypanis, ''Greek Poetry from Homer to Seferis'', Chapter 4, p.201</ref>

==Origins==

There is little exact information regarding the origin of ancient Greek comedy. According to [[Aristotle]], writing a century and a half later, it first took shape in [[Megara]] and [[Sicyon]], and [[Susarion]], the earliest Athenian comic poet, is himself supposed to have come from Megara. Aristotle also connects the origin of Comedy with popular phallic processions, and claims that it received official recognition (and thus state support) in Athens ''somewhat later'' than tragedy did. The Suda, supplemented by some inscriptional evidence, suggests that the earliest dramatic competitions in Athens took place at the [[City Dionysia]] festival in the early 480s B.C., and that a second competition was added at the [[Lenaia]] festival around 450. But comedies of some sort written by [[Epicharmus]] were performed already in the 490s in the Greek city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] in Sicily, and the origins of the genre cannot in fact be determined with any precision. The name itself apparently comes from the Greek words [[komos]], which means ''reveling band'', and the verb ''aeido'', ''to sing''.

Comedies were performed in Athens in formal competitions at two major festivals in honor of [[Dionysus]], the god of wine and now of theater. Each festival seems to have featured five comic poets staging a single play apiece, although it is possible that programs were reduced to three poets for a period due to the financial pressures of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Poets applied to the [[archon]] in charge of the relevant festival for the right to participate in it. If chosen, they were awarded a [[choregos]], i.e. a wealthy man who funded the performance as a form of taxation.

Aristotle wrote in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' that Comedy is a representation of laughable people and involves some kind of blunder or ugliness which does not cause pain or disaster.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a line 1449a]: "Comedy, as we have said, is a representation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but the laughable is a species of the base or ugly. It consists in some blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which is ugly and distorted but not painful."</ref>

==Periods of Ancient Greek Comedy==
The [[Alexandrian grammarians]], and most likely [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] in particular, seem to have been the first to divide Greek comedy into what became the canonical three periods:<ref name="Mastromarco94">Mastromarco (1994) p.12</ref>  Old Comedy (''arch<U+00E0>ia''), Middle Comedy (''mese'') and New Comedy (''nea''). These divisions appear to be largely arbitrary, and ancient comedy almost certainly developed constantly over the years. 
===Old Comedy (''arch<U+00E0>ia'')===

The earliest Athenian comedy, from the 480s to 440s BC, is almost entirely lost. The most important poets of the period were [[Magnes]], whose work survives only in a few fragments of dubious authenticity, and [[Cratinus]], who took the prize at the [[City Dionysia]] probably sometime around 450 BC. Although no complete plays by Cratinus are preserved, they are known through hundreds of fragments.

For modern readers, the most important Old Comic dramatist is [[Aristophanes]], whose works, with their pungent political satire and abundance of sexual and scatological innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes lampooned the most important personalities and institutions of his day, as can be seen, for example, in his buffoonish portrayal of [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Clouds]]'', and in sexual and political farce ''[[Lysistrata]]''. It is nonetheless important to realize that he was only one of a large number of comic poets working in Athens in the late 5th century, his most important contemporary rival being [[Eupolis]].

The Old Comedy subsequently influenced later European writers such as [[Rabelais]],  [[Cervantes]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], and [[Voltaire]]. In particular, they copied the technique of disguising a political attack as buffoonery. The legacy of Old Comedy can be seen today in political satires such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and in the televised buffoonery of [[Monty Python]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Old Comedy has been called one of the "sports" of literature in that it is so fantastic and unbridled.<ref>Cf. Philip W. Harsh, "A Handbook of Classical Drama", Chapter 
===Middle Comedy (''mese'')===

The line between Old and Middle Comedy is not clearly marked chronologically, [[Aristophanes]] and others of the latest writers of the Old Comedy being sometimes regarded as the earliest Middle Comic poets. For ancient scholars, the term may have meant little more than "later than Aristophanes and his contemporaries, but earlier than [[Menander]]". Middle Comedy is generally seen as differing from Old Comedy in three essential particulars: the role of the chorus was diminished to the point where it had no influence on the plot; public characters were not impersonated or personified onstage; and the objects of ridicule were general rather than personal, literary rather than political. For at least a time, mythological burlesque was popular among the Middle Comic poets. Stock characters of all sorts also emerge: courtesans, parasites, revellers, philosophers, boastful soldiers, and especially the self-conceited cook with his parade of culinary science

Because no complete Middle Comic plays have been preserved, it is impossible to offer any real assessment of their literary value or "genius". But many Middle Comic plays appear to have been revived in [[Sicily]] and [[Magna Graecia]] in this period, suggesting that they had considerable widespread literary and social appeal.

===New Comedy (''nea'')===

[[Image:Figurine actor BM TerrD226.jpg|thumb|Molded terracotta figurine of an actor wearing the mask of a bald-headed man, from the New Comedy, 2nd century BCE, from [[Canino]], Italy]]
The new comedy lasted throughout the reign of the [[Macedon|Macedonian]] rulers, ending about [[260 BC]]. 

Substantial fragments of New Comedy have survived, but no complete plays. The most substantially preserved text is the ''[[Dyskolos]]'' ("Difficult Man, Grouch") by [[Menander]], discovered on a papyrus in 1958. The so-called "Cairo Codex" (found in 1907) also preserves long sections of plays as [[Epitrepontes]] ("Men at Arbitration"), [[The Girl from Samos]], and [[Perikeiromene]] ("The Girl who had her Hair Shorn"). Much of the rest of our knowledge of New Comedy is derived from the [[Latin]] adaptations by [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

For the first time love became a principal element in the drama. The New Comedy relied on [[stock character]]s such as the [[senex iratus]], or "angry old man," the domineering parent who tries to thwart his son or daughter from achieving wedded happiness, and who is often led into the same vices and follies for which he has reproved his children, and the [[Miles Gloriosus|bragging soldier]] newly returned from war with a noisy tongue, a full purse and an empty head. The new comedy depicted Athenian society and the social morality of the period, presenting it in attractive colors but making no attempt to criticize or improve it.

The New Comedy influenced much of Western European literature, in particular the comic drama of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]], [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]] and [[William Wycherley|Wycherley]]<ref>The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization, vol. 1. ed. Alfred Bates. London: Historical Publishing Company, 1906. pp. 30-31.</ref>.

Much of contemporary romantic and situational comedy descends from the New Comedy sensibility, in particular generational comedies such as ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Meet the Parents]]''.
