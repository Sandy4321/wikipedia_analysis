'''Fort Nassau''' was the first Dutch fort built on Banda (or Bandaneira) Island, the main island of the [[Banda Islands]], part of [[Maluku]] in [[Indonesia]], completed in 1609.<ref name="Indonesian Banda">{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=Willard A.|title=Indonesian Banda|year=1991|publisher=Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Neira|location=Banda Neira}}</ref>{{rp|27}} Its purpose was to control the trade in nutmeg, which at that time was only available in the Banda Islands.

The Portuguese had previously attempted to build a fort in this location in 1529, but after constructing the foundations, they abandoned the work due to hostility from the Bandanese people. On 25 April 1609, the Dutch fleet commander, [[Admiral Verhoeven]],{{which|date=October 2013}} sent 750 soldiers ashore to commence their fort, choosing the Portuguese foundations as the location. The Bandanese, threatened by the new fort and the strength of the Dutch presence, and opposed to the Dutch plan to monopolise the Bandanese [[nutmeg]] industry attacked the Dutch, killing Admiral Verhoeven and 40 of his men.<ref name="Indonesian Banda"/>{{rp|28-29}} 

The Dutch hurried the fort to completion, and it served as their principal administrative and military base in the Banda's, later supplemented by other forts on Banda Besar, Forts Hollandia and Concordia, and Ai, Fort Revenge. 

Fort Nassau was a large four-bastioned quadrilateral structure, set by the channel between Banda and Banda Besar Islands. Today it is overlooked by the more impressive{{vague|date=October 2013}} [[Fort Belgica]].
