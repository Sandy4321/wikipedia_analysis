==Provisions and legislative intent==
The GSICA required that all public employers, contractors and subcontractors register and comply with the federal work authorization program operated by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] to verify new employee work eligibility.<ref name="New">{{cite web|title=New Rules and Regulations for Implementation of Section 2 of SB 529|url=http://www.dol.state.ga.us/spotlight/sp_sb_529_new_rules.htm|publisher=The Georgia Department of Labor|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> 

The GSICA was created in an effort to address illegal immigration problems in the following areas: private employment, public employment and contracting, public safety, and public benefits. 

It prevents any business from claiming certain wages paid to unauthorized employees as permissible business expense for state income tax purposes.<ref name="SB529">{{cite web|title=06 SB529/AP|url=http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/fulltext/sb529.htm|publisher=Georgia General Assembly|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref> The law requires citizenship verification for individuals older than the age of 18 who are receiving local, state, or federal benefits. In addition, authorities are obligated to verify the immigration status of any foreign national who receives jail time for a felony or DUI. If found to be in the country illegally authorities are to report unauthorized individuals to the Department of Homeland Security.<ref name="Perdue" /> The GSICA also provides modifications to the criminal code making it a felony to participate in or be affiliated with the trafficking of individuals for labor or sexual slavery.<ref name="SB529" />

== Background on Local Immigration Enforcement ==
 
The power to regulate immigration has been thought to be exclusively federal, however, states and localities have played a role as well in the regulation of immigration. In the twentieth century states have exercised their right to enforce restrictions on the access immigrants have regarding state benefits such as welfare as well as public employment restrictions that were placed on employers who hired unauthorized workers.<ref name="Nortman">{{cite book|last=C.Rodriguez, M.Chishti, and K.Nortman|title=Legal Limits on Immigrant Federalism|year=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California}}</ref> State and local efforts that have been made to prohibit employers from hiring unauthorized workers have two key historical features in common: First, it is declared unlawful to knowingly recruit, hire for employment, or continue to employ any individual who is an illegal worker. Second, employers are required to enter all employee information in the federal governments E-verify program.<ref name="Nortman" />
 
Historically, state and local governments have sought to enter cooperative agreements with the federal government that would allow local law enforcement authorities to enforce federal immigration law directly. Laws have also been passed requiring police to report the immigration status of those arrested or detained for serious crimes. When public officials, including police, become involved in immigration enforcement, law enforcement is then compromised. The question then becomes whether or not the state and local police have been awarded inherent constitutional authority authorizing the arrest of immigrants who are in violation of federal immigration law.<ref name="Nortman" />
 
In 1996 Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act adding sec. 287(g) which gave authorization to state and localities to enter into agreements with the federal government that would give state and local officials authority to arrest and detain individuals accused of violating federal immigration laws.<ref name="Nortman" />States and localities that agreed with this addition to the Immigration and Nationality Act received special training and required supervision by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.<ref name="Nortman" /> 

There is a history of problems associated with the federal government entering agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies that give them permission to identify individuals who are in the country illegally. Both legal and illegal immigrants are susceptible to exploitation by the power given to law enforcement to exercise the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In fiscal years 2006<U+2013>2008, ICE received about $60 million to train, supervise, and equip program participants.<ref name="USGAO">{{cite web|title=Immigration Enforcement|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/LPS113364/LPS113364/www.gao.gov/new.items/d09109.pdf|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> As of October 2008, ICE reported enrolling 67 agencies and training 951 state and local law enforcement officers. The ICE has<ref name="USGAO" /> created some management controls that allow it to govern sec 287(g) that are in some ways flawed and limited.<ref name="USGAO" /> The program lacks documented objectives which allows for inconsistency in its practice, and it also requires supervision but does not describe the nature and extend of that supervision.<ref name="USGAO" /> This allows for local law enforcement to act on instinct and personal prejudices without fear of consequence, which has led to community fears of racial profiling and intimidation.<ref name="USGAO" /> State and local participation in immigration enforcement have raised policy concerns.<ref name="Nortman" /> It creates policy dangers such as the risk of racial profiling by employers and police which directly affect immigrants and surrounding communities.<ref name="Nortman" />
