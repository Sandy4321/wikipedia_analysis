'''Leo Joseph "Joe" Smith Jr.''' ([[June 24]], [[1933]] <U+2013> [[June 14]], [[1993]]) was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who wrestled as '''Don Kent''' and also as '''The Black Dragon''', '''Doug Kent''', '''Joe Smith''' and '''Super Medico III''' during his 20 years in professional wrestling.<ref name="TagKanga">{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= Top 20: #1 The Fabulous Kangaroos | pages= 17-24 | id=ISBN 978-1-5502-2683-6}}</ref>

Don Kent is one half of [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] alongside partners [[Al Costello]], Bruno Bekkar or Johnny Heffernan. Despite being born in America, Kent was billed as [[Australia|Australian]] when he competed as a Kangaroo using the Kangaroos' "Ultra Australian" [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]], complete with [[Boomerang|boomerangs]], [[Slouch hat|bush hats]] and "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" as their entrance music.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

When Kent was not one half of the Kangaroos, he mainly worked as "Bulldog" Don Kent in [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Mid-America]] and [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Detroit]] in the singles and the tag team divisions until his retirement in 1986.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

==Career==
Kent attended [[St. Philip Catholic Central High School]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. He was recruited by the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a catcher right out of high school. Kent<U+2019>s father thought that Kent was too young to play professional baseball and insisted that he go to St. Benedict<U+2019>s College in Kansas. After graduating, Kent worked at a Veterans Administration Medical Center in his hometown of Battle Creek while being trained by Leapin<U+2019> Larry Chene for a professional wrestling career.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

===Starting out===
Kent made his professional wrestling debut in 1956 working under such names as "Don Kent", "Joe Smith" and "The Black Dragon", generally working as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad guy) in the Michigan area.<ref name="TagKanga"/> In the first half of the [[1960s]] Don Kent went to [[Arizona]] and worked in the local wrestling promotion, where he was [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|booked]] as a sadistic heel. In Arizona, Kent worked a storyline that drew full houses at the Phoenix Madison Square Garden against local [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] (good guy) Tito Montez. The two faced off week after week in a variety of specialty matches such as a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Names and variations|chain match]], "[[List of professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Arizona death match]]" and [[List of professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]]. The angle ended with a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] that saw Montez win after overcoming Kent<U+2019>s cheating ways. One week after the storyline ended, attendance dropped by half and Don Kent soon left the area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://azwrestlinglegends.com/content/view/31/57/ | title = Legend Profile: Don Kent | accessdate = 2007-08-05 | author = Arizona Wrestling Legends.com}}</ref>

===Fabulous Kangaroos===
{{main|The Fabulous Kangaroos#Al Costello and Don Kent|l1=The Fabulous Kangaroos: Costello and Kent}}

In 1967, Al Costello reformed the tag team [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] with Ray St. Clair who retired after six months with knee problems. A few months after St. Clair retired, Costello found Don Kent to don the [[Slouch hat|bush hat]]. Kent, who was from [[Michigan]], adopted the Ultra-Australian gimmick (but retained his American accent) and a second version of the Fabulous Kangaroos was formed. Costello and Kent teamed together on a regular basis from 1968 until 1974, approximately the same amount of time that Costello spent teaming with his original partner [[Roy Heffernan]].<ref name="TagKanga"/> The Kangaroos won their first tag team championship a few months after teaming up, during a tour of Japan for <U+201C>International Wrestling Enterprise". Over the years, they defended their title in promotions around the globe. In Canada, they were the first [[Eastern Sports Association]] [[ESA International Tag Team Championship|International Tag Team Champions]]; in the [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|World Wrestling Association]], they held the WWA World Tag Team Championship twice.<ref name="Titles"/> In addition to winning titles all over North America, they also made appearances for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now known as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]].<ref name="TagKanga"/> 

The Kangaroos frequented [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Detroit]], where they held the Detroit version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Detroit version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] for most of 1971.<ref name="Titles"/> By the end of 1972, the Kangaroos began working for [[Nick Gulas]]<U+2019> [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Mid-America]]. In Mid-America, they held the local version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], the Mid-America version, on three occasions.<ref name="Titles"/> 

After a match in the [[Cincinnati Gardens]], Costello's hip was damaged when an enraged fan threw a [[fire extinguisher]] from the balcony. Costello had hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and was fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. With Costello unable to compete, the Fabulous Kangaroos split up.<ref name="OneLegends">{{cite web| url = http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/guest-14.htm| title = Al Costello, "THE" Fabulous Kangaroos | accessdate= 2007-08-05 | author = Siler, Bob | publisher= 1Wrestlinglegends.com}}</ref> After the Kangaroos went their separate ways Don Kent returned to NWA Mid-America as a singles wrestler.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

===Working alone===
When Costello retired, Kent remained with Mid-America where he developed into a main heel as the "Dog Collar" wearing, barking "Bulldog" Don Kent. Kent teamed with Chris Gallagher and won the [[NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship]] on two occasions, beating the teams of Frank Monte and Nick DeCarlo as well as Steve Kovac and Ricky Gibson for the title. Kent teamed up with Count Drummer to win the Mid America Tag Team title once more, defeating [[Jackie Fargo]] and George Gulas on [[November 6]] [[1974]], losing the title to Fargo and Gulas three weeks later.<ref name="Titles"/> Kent won the [[NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship]], the main title of the promotion, in October 1974 by defeating Tony Charles. Kent lost his first Mid-America title to Jackie Fargo and won it twice more in 1975, first from Fargo and then later from [[Grady Johnson|"Crazy" Luke Graham]]. Graham defeated Kent on [[May 7]] [[1975]] to end his third and final reign with the title.<ref name="Titles"/>

In late 1975, Kent moved closer to home and work for [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]]<U+2019>s "NWA Detroit" (also known as "Big Time Wrestling") using his "Bulldog" Don Kent persona. On [[November 1]] [[1975]], Kent defeated [[Mark Levin]] to win the Detroit version of the [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version)|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]]. Levin regained the title in December.<ref name="Titles"/> On [[October 16]] [[1976]], Kent regained the title in a bloody brawl against [[Juan Kachmanian|Pampero Firpo]] and held on to it until [[January 8]] [[1977]], when he lost it to [[Gino Hernandez]].<ref name="Titles"/> Kent developed into a long running enemy of the Sheik, who was the most popular man in the promotion, with the two clashing many times in wild and bloody brawls.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

In 1977, having recovered from hip surgery, Al Costello teamed up with Kent as The Fabulous Kangaroos for a tour of Puerto Rico with the [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC). In Puerto Rico, the Kangaroos were billed on arrival as the [[WWC World Tag Team Championship|WWC World Tag Team Champions]]. The Kangaroos lost the title to [[Carlitos Col<U+00F3>n|Carlos Colon]] and Jose Rivera on [[March 12]] [[1977]]. The Kangaroos remained in WWC throughout 1977 and into 1978, never regaining the WWC World Tag Team Championship.<ref name="Titles"/> After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling and Costello focused more on managing due to his bad hip.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

In 1977 Kent returned to the Alabama area to work for NWA Mid-America once more. Kent defeated [[Lanny Poffo]] to win his fourth Mid-America Heavyweight title in December 1977 and lost it to Poffo<U+2019>s brother [[Randy Savage]] on [[January 3]] [[1978]].<ref name="Titles"/> In 1979, Kent wrestled in Puerto Rico as a singles wrestler, winning the [[WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship]] from Chief War Cloud on [[January 6]] [[1979]] and holding it for over 6 months until he lost it to Hurricane Castillo on [[July 21]] [[1979]]. Shortly after losing the Caribbean title, Kent moved up a level and defeated Puerto Rican legend Carlos Col<U+00F3>n on [[August 3]][[1979]] only to lose the title to [[Jose Gonzalez (wrestler)|Invader I]] three weeks later in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]].<ref name="Titles"/>

===Kangaroo return===
{{main|The Fabulous Kangaroos#Don Kent and Bruno Bekkar|l1=The Fabulous Kangaroos: Kent and Bekkar, Kent and Heffernan}}

In 1981, Costello teamed Kent with Bruno Bekkar, who was best known for working in his native New Zealand and Australia, and work a tour as The Kangaroos for the WWC with Costello serving as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]].<ref name="TagKanga"/> Kent and Bekkar won the WWC North American Tag Team title from the team of [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] and [[Gerald Brisco|Jerry Brisco]] on [[October 22]] [[1981]]. This version of the Kangaroos first lost to, then regained the titles from, Invader I and Super Gladiador before losing them for good on [[January 26]] [[1982]] to Invader and Gladiador.<ref name="Titles"/> After this tour of the Caribbean, Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand to work for the local promotions there.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

Bekkar was replaced with "Johnny Heffernan" (Canadian Bob Della Serra), a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan for what was the final Kangaroo version to compete.<ref name="TagKanga"/> The team ended [[Terry Funk|Terry]] and [[Dory Funk, Jr.| Dory Funk, Jr.<U+2019>s]] year and a half long run with the WWC World Tag Team championship when they defeated them on [[May 1]] [[1982]]. The team held the gold for less than 2 months before losing the belts again.<ref name="Titles"/> After ending their tour in Puerto Rico, Kent and Heffernan returned to mainland USA to work for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], a promotion the Kangaroos had worked in 1962. In Florida, The Kangaroos won the [[NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship]] four times.<ref name="Titles"/> The final storyline involving the Fabulous Kangaroos saw Al Costello bring in [[J.J. Dillon]] to act as his short term replacement as he "took care of business". When Costello returned from his business trip, Dillon refused to give up the Kangaroos' contracts and was backed up by both Kent and Heffernan (in storyline terms). This storyline was designed to write Al Costello out of The Fabulous Kangaroos storyline and allow him to retire from wrestling altogether.<ref name="OneLegends"/> Not long after Costello retired, Kent and Della Serra went their separate ways.<ref name="TagKanga"/>

===After The Kangaroos===
After The Kangaroos split up for the last time, Kent working mainly in Michigan with tours of Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, Don Kent donned a mask and worked under the name "Super M<U+00E9>dico III" alongside [[Jose Estrada, Sr.|Super M<U+00E9>dico I]]. Kent was brought in as a storyline replacement for the real Super M<U+00E9>dico III, who was played by [[Jose Estrada, Jr.]] M<U+00E9>dicos I & III won the WWC World Tag Team Championship on [[August 4]] [[1984]] from [[Tonga Fifita|King Tonga]] and Gran Apollo.<ref name="Titles"/> When Super M<U+00E9>dico III was unmasked in October and revealed to NOT be Jose Estrada, Jr., the team was stripped of their titles because they used an illegal man to help defend the title.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://bodyslamming.com/wwc/wwctag.html | title = Bodyslammin<U+2019> WWC Tag Team Title | accessdate= 2007-08-05 | publisher= bodyslammin.com | quote = Titles vacated on October 8, 1984 in Bayamon, Puerto Rico when Medico III (Don Kent) loses his mask. }}</ref> After being exposed as the fake "Medico III" Kent returned to the United States and worked primarily in the Indianapolis based [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|World Wrestling Association]] where he continued to wrestle until 1986, when he went into semi-retirement. After 1986 Kent only wrested on special occasions, stepping into the ring as late as 1992 at the age of 59.<ref name="TagKanga"/> Don Kent died on [[June 14]] [[1993]] after suffering from [[Leukemia]] for a long period of time.<ref name="OWOWKent">{{cite web| url = http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/d/don-kent.html | title = Don Kent profile | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | publisher = Online World of Wrestling | quote = June 14, 1993: Don Kent passes away as a result of Leukemia at the age of 61}}</ref>
