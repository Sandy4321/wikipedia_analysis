'''''Silicon Dreams''''' is a [[trilogy]] of [[interactive fiction]] games developed by [[Level 9 Computing]] during the [[1980s]]. The first game was ''Snowball'', released in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]], followed a year later by ''Return to Eden'', and then by ''The Worm in Paradise'' in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]]. The following year they appeared together in a [[Product bundling|bundle]] as the first, second and last of the [[Silicon]] [[Dream]]s.  Early advertisements gave it the title of ''Silicon Dream'', but it was later [[plural]]ised.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web | last = Schmidt | first = Miron | coauthors = Schulz, Manuel | date = 1999-01-25 | url = http://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/level9/info/Level9_Facts.txt | title = Level 9 Fact Sheet | accessdate = 2007-10-08 | work = The Interactive Fiction Archive}}</ref>

As most Level 9 games, the trilogy used a [[proprietary]] [[interpreted language]] called A-code and appeared on all major [[home computer]] [[Platform (computing)|platforms]] of the time, such as [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]], on either [[Floppy disk|diskette]] or [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]. Level 9 [[Self-publishing|self-published]] each game separately, but the bundle was [[Publishing|published]] by [[Telecomsoft]], which sold it in the [[United Sates]] under the [[Telecomsoft#Firebird|Firebird]] [[Subsidiary|label]] and in [[Europe]] under the [[Telecomsoft#Rainbird|Rainbird]] label.<ref name="factsheet" />

The trilogy is set in a not too-distant [[future]] when [[human]]s have started [[Space colonization|colonising space]].  For the first two instalments the player takes the role of Kim Kimberly, an [[Espionage|undercover agent]], whose goal in ''Snowball'' is to save the colonist's [[spacecraft]] from crashing into a [[star]], and in ''Return to Eden'' to stop the [[defense (military)|defence]] system at the destination planet of Eden from destroying the craft.  In the ''The Worm in Paradise'', the player, taking on the role of an unnamed [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Eden, must travel around the [[city]] of Enoch, learn it's [[Secrecy|secrets]], earn [[money]] and save the [[planet]].

==Gameplay==

The games were [[Software development|developed]] using Level 9's own A-Code [[game engine|engine]] and the [[gameplay]] is controlled through the use of a [[text parser]] for entering [[Command (computing)|commands]] at the "What now?" [[Command line interpreter|prompt]].<ref name="Snowball_instructions">{{cite web | author = Level 9 Computing | date = 1983 | url = ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/games-info/s/Snowball.txt | title = Snowball instructions | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref>  The [[parsing|parser]] can [[Interpreter (computing)|interpret]] more than 1000 words<ref>{{cite journal | last = Medley | first = Sue | title = Silicon Dreams review | journal = SynTax | issue = 2 | publisher = SynTax | date = 1989-09 | url = http://www.syntax2000.co.uk/issues/02/silirev.asc.txt | format = [[TXT]] | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> to control movement or actions.  It looks at the command, picking out two or three words it knows, ignoring the order, and tries to guess what is meant.<ref name="Snowball_instructions" />  For movement, the usual commands for moving '[[North|NORTH]]', '[[South|SOUTH]]', '[[East|EAST]]' and '[[West|WEST]]' are available (and their [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] form of 'N', 'S', 'E' and 'W') as well as 'UP' and 'DOWN' ('U' and 'D' respectively) and a number of other directions and 'modes' of movement (like 'JUMP').  For actions, it understands how to pick up objects, opening doors, lighting lamps, as well as dropping objects and wielding them.<ref name="Snowball_instructions" />  Additionally, there are commands to invoke 'SAVE' and 'RESTORE' of game positions to [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] or [[floppy disk]] (for some systems also to [[Random access memory|RAM]]), ask for 'HELP', turn off pictures and turn them on again with 'WORDS' and 'PICTURES' respectively, an 'OOPS' command to [[undo]] previous commands.<ref name="silicon_dreams_instructions">{{Citation | author-link = Level 9 Computing | year = 1986 | title = Silicon Dreams: Loading Instructions and Gameplay Guide | publisher = Level 9 Computing}}</ref>

''Silicon Dreams'' can be played as three separate games, but to obtain a maximum score, the games must be completed in order, carrying the score from one adventure to the next.  Points are not scored for collecting treasures, but rather for doing specific tasks towards the aim of the individual game:

'''''Snowball''''': The mission is to get to the main control room in the engine unit, and rescue the starship from crashing into the planet Eden.

'''''Return to Eden''''': The objective is to get into the city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

'''''Worm in Paradise''''': The aim is to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden, saving the planet in the process.<ref name="silicon_dreams_instructions" />

==Setting==

The trilogy starts during a time when the human race is [[Literal and figurative language|literally]] reaching for the stars. After linking the entire [[Solar System]] through [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] chains, the "Big 5" nations of [[Earth]] ([[China]], [[European Union|EEC]], [[Oceania|Pacific]], [[United States|US]] [[Empire]] and [[Soviet Union|USSR]]) set in motion a plan to [[Space colonization|colonise]] the [[galaxy]] know as the [[Terran]] Expansionary Phase. It lasted 90 years from 2120 to 2210.

The first step was to launch [[Space probe|probes]] into [[outer space]]. The probes reported any Earth-sized [[Extrasolar planet|planet]] they encountered during their voyage, which would last [[Century|centuries]]. Each probe was followed by a [[survey ship]] 10 years later. The ship's mission was to [[map]] the planet and if it was [[Sustainable habitat|habitable]], it would [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] Earth and then, while waiting for the [[Settler|colonists]] to arrive, it would [[Terraforming|terraform]] the planet.

Terraforming was a complex process. The survey ship needed to [[Mining|mine]] materials from [[asteroid]]s to build a [[robot]] [[factory]] in space and this could take [[decade]]s. The robots then proceeded to build more space factories that in turn would produce better robots. The robots also built large [[Communications satellite|satellite dishes]] to collect [[data]] sent from Earth containing the latest [[Technology|technological]] advances. Then the actual terraforming took place. The robots [[Landing|landed]] on the planet and started to build cities while also launching more probes and survey ships further into space.

[[Image:snowball9diagram.png|left|thumb|320px|Artist rendering of the ''Snowball 9'']]

Once Earth received [[news]] of a habitable planet, the plan's third and final step took place. Ten giant [[passenger]] discs, each carrying 200,000 colonists in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], were towed into space. Next came the [[Spacecraft propulsion|engine]] unit, which was linked a week later to the front of the discs, and then the [[Sleeper ship|colony ship]] was completed and ready to go.

During the 2190s, 50 colony ships were launched from the EEC's [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] base, among them the ''Snowball 9'', which carried the first colonists for planet [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] on the [[40 Eridani|Eridani A]] [[Planetary system|system]]. For the next three years, the accelerator chains beyond [[Pluto]] fired ten-ton blocks of [[ammonia]] [[ice]] at the travelling ship. The ''Snowball 9'' caught the ice blocks with [[hook]]s and piled it around the passenger discs, forming a hollow shell that would cover most of the ship and would serve as a [[shield]] until it was needed to fuel the [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] engines on the later part of the trip. This ice shell gave the [[Snowball]] series its name.

After receiving the last ice block, the [[crew]] put the ship in [[autopilot]] and went to [[Hibernation|hibernate]] with the passengers, leaving the ship's [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] to robots. Except for a brief period of activity to start [[deceleration]], the crew slept for most of the trip, waking up one year before reaching Eden. The plan was to continue deceleration while consuming the last of the ice shell, and then put the ship in [[orbit]] around the planet, delivering the passengers down by [[glider]]s that would be retrieved by hooks to be [[reuse]]d.

===Kim Kimberly===

Kim Kimberley is a [[Human height|tall]], [[Physical fitness|athletic]], [[Intelligence|intelligent]] woman with [[Eye color|brown eyes]] and [[Blond|fair hair]]. She was born on [[September 29]], 2172 [[Anno Domini|AD]], and was raised at [[Hampstead]] [[Day care|Cr<U+00E8>che]], which was closed when she was 13 due to [[Infraction|violations]] of the [[Android]] Protection [[Act of Parliament|Acts]]. She finished her education at the Milton Keynes School of Life in [[Malta]], then returned to [[England]] for [[National service|National Service]]. She started out doing standard [[security]] work with the occasional [[surveillance]] of [[Subversion (politics)|subversive]] members of [[society]], but ended working as a [[Counter-intelligence|counter-espionage]] agent. Still in her [[Twentysomething (term)|twenties]], Kim accepted to travel [[undercover]] on the ''Snowball 9'' to be there as the [[Last Resort|last resort]] for the [[worst-case scenario]]. 

==Snowball==

[[Image:SnowballScreen.png|frame|right|Commodore 64 screenshot of ''Snowball'' as it appears in the expanded version of ''Silicon Dreams''.]]

===Plot===

As the ''Snowball 9'' approached Eden, however, something goes wrong: a [[Crewman|crewmember]] becameomes [[Insanity|insane]]. She [[murder]]s her [[shipmate]]s, destroys the [[Telecommunication|communication]] [[system]] and set the ship on a [[collision course]] with the [[Star|sun]]. The robots, being little more than [[Automaton|automata]], continue their eveyday operations oblivious to the danger but the ship's [[computer]], capable of [[Thought|thinking]], wakes up [[Espionage|secret agent]] Kim Kimberley before the deranged crewmember destroyes it.  She exits her modified [[Cryopreservation|stasis chamber]] with the goal of finding a way to reach the [[Bridge (ship)|control room]], armed with nothing but her [[Wit#Further meanings|wits]] and whatever [[tool]]s she might find, and avert [[disaster]].

===Development===

''Snowball'' was originally released in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]] as the company's fourth adventure game using the A-Code system.<ref name="factsheet" />  The original release used version 1 of this system<ref>{{cite web | last = Jensen | first = Henrik | url = http://users.cybercity.dk/~bse16410/adv/level9/le9main.htm | title = Level 9 | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | language = Danish}}</ref> and was initially released only for the [[BBC Micro]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Nascom]],<ref name="thenextlevel_part1">{{cite journal | last = Hewison | first = Richard | year = 2004 | month = July | title = The Next Level - part 1 | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 6 | pages = 53-57}}</ref> but was later followed by versions for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Camputers Lynx]], [[Tangerine Computer Systems#Oric-1|Oric-1]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit]]<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = November | title = Level 9 advertisement | journal = [[Micro Adventurer]] | issue = 1 | pages = 2 | publisher = [[Sunshine Books]] | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=MicroAdventurer/Issue01/Pages/MicroAdventurer0100002.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref> as well as for the [[Memotech MTX]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Enterprise (computer)|Enterprise]] and [[MSX]].<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1985 | month = March | title = Level 9 advertisement | journal = [[Micro Adventurer]] | issue = 17 | pages = 2 | publisher = [[Sunshine Books]] | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=MicroAdventurer/Issue17/Pages/MicroAdventurer1700002.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref>  It is noteworthy for including over 7,000 locations.  To achieve this, 6,800 of the locations of the passenger disks form a colour-coded [[maze]] with minimal descriptions.<ref>{{cite web | last = Granade | first = Stephen | url = http://brasslantern.org/community/history/level9.html | title = History of Interactive Fiction: Level 9 | accessdate = 2007-10-08 | work = Brass Lantern}}</ref>

Another peculiar aspect of the game was the confusion behind the main character's [[gender]]. In an interview for ''[[Sinclair User]]'', Chris Bourne asked: "Is the [[Androgyny|androgynous]] Kim a man or woman?"  Pete Austin pointed out that "there's a credit at the end for the design of 'Ms Kimberley's costume,'" but also admitted that Kim Kimberley was "a deliberately [[unisex]] name."<ref name="onthelevel">{{cite journal | last = Bourne | first = Chris | year = 1985 | month = May | title = Hit Squad: On the level | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 38 | pages = 60<U+2013>62 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/038/htsquad.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref> The debate came to an end with the release of ''Return to Eden'', where it was made clear that Kim was not a man, because the surviving [[crewman|crewmembers]] confuse her with the woman who tried to destroy the ship.

==Return to Eden==

[[Image:ReturnToEdenScreen.png|frame|Commodore 64 screenshot of ''Return to Eden'']]

===Plot===

With the ''Snowball 9'' [[orbit]]ing Eden, the surviving crewmembers put Kim on trial. The only evidence against her is the "mempak" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they [[sentence (law)|sentence]] her to death. About to be thrown into [[Outer space|space]], Kim manages to escape aboard a "stratoglider". An hour later, she lands on Eden, which is when the game starts.

The first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the ''Snowball 9'' crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native [[robot]]s take this as proof that the ''Snowball 9'' is not the [[human]] ship they were expecting but a hostile [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time runs out for the ''Snowball 9'' and everyone aboard it.

===Development===

Unlike its predecessor, ''Return to Eden'' only had around 250 locations,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Price | first = Richard | year = 1985 | month = January | title = Spectrum Software Scene: Snowbound in Eden | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 34 | pages = 50 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/034/sftwre.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref> but it was the first game of the trilogy to feature graphics. Other adventure games had included graphics before, but with version 2 of the A-Code system, Level 9 managed to [[encode]] a location graphics into as little as 40 [[byte]]s per picture hence making it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 [[Kibibyte|KiB]].<ref name="thenextlevel_part1" /> The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor.<ref name="Adventureland">{{cite web | last = Meier | first = Stefan | coauthors = Persson, Hans | url = http://adventure.if-legends.org/Level_9_Computing.html | title = Level 9 Computing | accessdate = 2008-07-20 | work = Adventureland}}</ref>

The game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a [[comic book]] [[person|character]], so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hewison | first = Richard | url = http://ifguide.if-legends.org/essays/Level-9.html | title = Level 9: Past masters of the adventure game | accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref>

==The Worm in Paradise==

[[Image:TheWormInParadiseScreen.png|frame|right|left|Commodore 64 screenshot of ''The Worm in Paradise'']]

===Plot===

A hundred years after the arrival of colonists aboard the ''Snowball 9'', planet Eden has become home to half a [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] people. In this paradise run by robots there's no [[crime]], no [[tax]]es, no [[unemployment]], and no [[freedom]]. The population lives in domed "megapolis," and perhaps due to the war that took place during ''Return to Eden'', there's no contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of [[flying saucer]]s keeps the population afraid from going outside.

The main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he wakes up. It was only a Reveline simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available under the reign of the third Kim.  This "Garden of Eden as a prison" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers.

===Development===

The trilogy's final installment is a departure from the previous games. It "evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word [[vocabulary]], a very highly advanced English input, memory enhancing-text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated [[type-ahead]], and [[Computer multitasking|multi-tasking]] so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Brewster | first = Derek | year = 1986 | month = March | title = The Worm in Paradise | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|''CRASH'']] | issue = 26 | pages = 91<U+2013>92 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/26/worm.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref>  This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system.<ref name="thenextlevel_part1" /> It was released for four fewer platforms, leaving out the [[Camputers Lynx|Lynx]], [[Memotech MTX]], [[Nascom]] and [[Tangerine Computer Systems#Oric-1|Oric-1]] compared to the two previous releases.<ref name="Adventureland" />

Another departure is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also [[time-based]] and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while gameplay remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a [[political thriller]] that resembles the [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.  Similar to what happened when ''Snowball'' was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story took place. The ''Level 9 Fact Sheet'' says: "...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden."<ref name="factsheet" /> Another article stated: "Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III..."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Manor | first = John | year = 1988 | month = August | title = 8-bit product reviews: Silicon Dreams | journal = [[ANTIC (magazine)|''ANTIC'']] | issue = vol. 7, no. 4 | pages = 41 | url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n4/8bitreviews.html | accessdate = 2007-10-07}}</ref> Furthermore, Pete Austin said: "Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future" and "The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place."<ref name="onthelevel" /> Notice that these sources called the game by its original name, ''Worm in Paradise''.

==The trilogy==

''Silicon Dreams'' was the second title published by Telecomsoft, the first being ''[[Jewels of Darkness]]'',<ref name="factsheet" /> in an four-game publishing deal signed by level 9 in April 1986.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1988 | month = March | title = News | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|''CRASH'']] | issue = 50 | pages = 8 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/50/news.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}</ref>  This deal gave Level 9 (which was often referred to as <U+201C>British [[Infocom]].<U+201D><ref>{{cite web | last = Maher | first = Jimmy | date = 2006-07-10 | url = http://home.grandecom.net/~maher/if-book/if-6.htm | title = Chapter 6: The Rest of Commercial IF | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | work = Let's Tell a Story Together (A History of Interactive Fiction)}}</ref>) an opportunity to spurce up their previous titles and add support for the [[16-bit]] market as well as an possible entry into the potential lucrative US market.<ref name="thenextlevel_part2">{{cite journal | last = Hewison | first = Richard | year = 2004 | month = August | title = The Next Level - part 2 | journal = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 7 | pages = 59-63}}</ref>  Subsequently, the trilogy was released for a total of 12 platforms, leaving out the [[BBC Micro|BBC]] and [[Enterprise (computer)|Enterprise]] compared to ''The Worm in Paradise'', but adding support for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad PCW]], [[Atari ST]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] [[DOS]], [[Macintosh]] and [[Sinclair QL]].<ref name="silicon_dreams_instructions" />  All the games were updated to version 3 of the A-Code system<ref name="factsheet" /> with updated text and new graphics for inclusion in the release of the ''Silicon Dreams'' trilogy in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]]<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gerrard | first = Mike | year = 1987 | month = May | title = YS Adventures: Silicon Dreams | journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 15 | pages = 58 | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/silicondreams.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-08 }}</ref> with expanded, text-only versions for some releases.<ref name="ZXComputing8703">{{cite journal | last = Sweasey | first = Peter | year = 1987 | month = March | title = Mindplay: Silicon Dreams | journal = [[ZX Computing]] | issue = 8703 | pages = 90 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ZXComputing/Issue8703/Pages/ZXComputing870300078.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref> 

The "Rainbird" release came in a 215 x 153 x 27 [[millimetre|mm]] [[cardboard]] box while the "Firebird" release came in a 227 x 163 x 30 mm black, plastic box.  Both featured a 150 x 210 mm, 68-page [[book]]let with loading instructions, a guide to playing the game and [[Peter McBride (writer)|Peter McBride's]] [[novella]] ''Eden Song'' which served as an introduction to ''The Worm in Paradise''.<ref name="factsheet" />  The novella was also used as a [[copy prevention|copy-protection]] device, from which, upon restore of a saved game, the player had to enter a word from a page and line reference.<ref name="ZXComputing8703" /> 

== Reception ==

All games were released individually and generally received good initial reviews.  ''Snowball'' won the Best Text-only Adventure prize at ''[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]'' 1984 ''Readers Awards'',<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1984/85 | month = Christmas special | title = Crash Readers Awards 1984 | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|Crash]] | issue = 12 | pages = 94<U+2013>105 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/12/awards.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref> ''Return to Eden'' received a 90% score in ''Sinclair Programs''<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sinclair Programs staff | year = 1985 | month = February | title = Soft Focus: Return to Eden review | journal = [[Sinclair Programs]] | issue = 8502 | pages = 14 | publisher = [[EMAP]] | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairPrograms/Issue8502/Pages/SinclairPrograms850200014.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref>, and ''The Worm in Paradise'' was rated a ''Your Sinclair Megagame''<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = John | year = 1986 | month = February | title = Beast of Eden | journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 2 | pages = 80-81 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue02/Pages/YourSinclair0200080.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref> and a ''Sinclair User Classic''.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Price | first = Richard | year = 1986 | month = March | title = Adventure review: Worm in Paradise | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 48 | pages = 70-71 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/048/worminp.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref>

When the trilogy was released it received unanimously, good reviews from the ZX Spectrum press:  [[Sinclair User]] gave it a ''Sinclair User Classic'', calling it an "...unqualified success for Level 9 and Rainbird."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rook | first = Gary | year = 1987 | month = February | title = Adventure review: Silicon Dreams | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 59 | pages = | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue059/Pages/SinclairUser05900090.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref> [[Your Sinclair]] awarded a ''Your Sinclair Mega Game'',<ref name="YourSinclair15">{{cite journal | last = Gerrard | first = Mike | year = 1987 | month = March | title = YS Adventures: Silicon Dreams | journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 15 | pages = 58 | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue15/Pages/YourSinclair1500058.jpg | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref> and ZX Computing a ''Monster Hit''.<ref name="ZXComputing8703" />  The Commodore 64 magazine [[Zzap!64]] gave it a 90% score which awarded it with a ''Zzap!64 Sizzler''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zzap!64 staff "White Wizard" | year = 1987 | month = February | title = Zzap!64 adventure: Silicon Dreams review | journal = [[Zzap!64]] | issue = 22 | pages = 44 | publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]] | url = http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=22&page=44 | format = [[JPG]] | accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref>  However, some reviews found the graphics "...truly abysmal.
