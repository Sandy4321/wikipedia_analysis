=== Early history ===
{{main|Prehistoric Scotland}}
{{see also|Timeline of prehistoric Scotland}}
Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the [[Mesolithic period]]. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the [[ice sheet]] retreated after the [[Last glacial period|last glaciation]].<ref>The earliest known evidence is a [[flint]] arrowhead from [[Islay]].

Groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] of [[Orkney]] dates from this period. [[Neolithic]] habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Francis|title=Britain BC| publisher=HarperPerennial|location=London|year=2003|isbn=978-0-00-712693-4|pages=98<U+2013>104 & 246<U+2013>250}}</ref>

=== Roman influence ===
{{Main|Scotland during the Roman Empire}}
The written [[protohistory]] of Scotland began with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]] in southern and central Great Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales, administering it as a [[Roman province|province]] called ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]''. Roman [[invasion]]s and occupations of southern Scotland were a series of brief interludes.

[[File:Edinburgh Castle from the south east.JPG|thumb|left|[[Edinburgh Castle]]. Human habitation of the site is dated back as far as the 9th century BC, although the nature of this early settlement is unclear.]]
According to the Roman historian [[Tacitus]], the [[Caledonians]] "turned to armed resistance on a large scale", attacking Roman forts and skirmishing with their [[Roman Legion|legions]]. In a surprise night-attack, the Caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole [[9th Legion]] until it was saved by Agricola's cavalry.<ref name="The Romans in Scotland">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/the_romans/ |title=The Romans in Scotland |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

In AD 83<U+2013>84 the General [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] defeated the [[Caledonians]] at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]. [[Tacitus]] wrote that, before the battle, the Caledonian leader, [[Calgacus]], gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the "last of the free" and accused the Romans of "making the world a desert and calling it peace" (freely translated).<ref name="The Romans in Scotland"/> After the Roman victory, [[Castra|Roman forts]] were briefly set along the [[Gask Ridge]] close to the [[Highland Boundary Fault|Highland line]] (only [[Cawdor (Roman Fort)|Cawdor]] near [[Inverness]] is known to have been constructed beyond that line). Three years after the battle, the [[Roman army|Roman armies]] had withdrawn to the [[Southern Uplands]].<ref>Hanson, William S. ''The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes'', in Edwards, Kevin J. & Ralston, Ian B.M. (Eds) (2003) Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archeology and History, 8000 BC&nbsp;<U+2014> AD 1000.

The Romans erected [[Hadrian's Wall]] to control tribes on both sides of the wall,<ref name=snyder>{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Christopher A. |year=2003 |title=The Britons |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-22260-X |postscript=}}</ref> and the ''[[Limes|Limes Britannicus]]'' became the northern border of the Roman Empire, although the army held the [[Antonine Wall]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] for two short periods <U+2013> the last of these during the time of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] from 208 until 210.<ref>Robertson, Anne S.

The Roman [[military occupation]] of a significant part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years, although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by [[Brython]]ic tribes such as the [[Votadini]] and [[Damnonii]], would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] term [[Hen Ogledd]] ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]]-speaking people around AD 500 to 800.<ref name=snyder/> According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland.<ref>"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/scot/western/article_1.shtml Dalriada: The Land of the First Scots]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}".

The [[Kingdom of the Picts]] (based in [[Fortriu]] by the 6th century) was the state that eventually became known as "Alba" or "Scotland". The development of "Pictland", according to the historical model developed by [[Peter Heather]], was a natural response to Roman imperialism.<ref>Peter Heather, "State Formation in Europe in the First Millennium A.D.", in Barbara Crawford (ed.), ''Scot in Dark Ages Europe'', (Aberdeen, 1994), pp. 47<U+2013>63</ref> Another view places emphasis on the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]], and the reign of [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bridei m. Beli]] (671<U+2013>693), with another period of consolidation in the reign of [[<U+00D3>engus I of the Picts|<U+00D3>engus mac Fergusa]] (732<U+2013>761).<ref>For instance, [[Alex Woolf]], "The Verturian Hegemony: a mirror in the North", in M. P. Brown & C. A. Farr, (eds.), ''Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Europe'', (Leicester, 2001), pp. 106<U+2013>11.</ref>

The Kingdom of the Picts as it was in the early 8th century, when [[Bede]] was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1107<U+2013>1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n]] (Kenneth MacAlpin).<ref name=Lynch_359>{{cite book|chapter=Kenneth mac Alpin|last=Brown|first=Dauvit|editor=M.

From a base of territory in eastern Scotland north of the [[River Forth]] and south of the [[River Oykel]], the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the [[Old English|English]]-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Galloway]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]]-speaking [[Caithness]]; by the end of the 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its [[Anglo-Scottish border|modern borders]]. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.

The push for this change was the reign of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and the [[Davidian Revolution]]. [[Feudalism]], government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns (called [[burgh]]s) began in this period. These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis, whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, while the rest of the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468.<ref>{{cite book|last=Withers|first=Charles, W.J.|title=Gaelic in Scotland, 1698<U+2013>1981|publisher=John Donald |location=Edinburgh |year=1984 |pages=16<U+2013>41; |isbn=978-0-85976-097-3 |authorlink=Charles W.

The death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in March 1286, followed by that of his granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], broke the centuries-old succession line of Scotland's kings and shattered the 200-year golden age that began with David I. [[Edward I of England]] was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the Scottish crown, and he organised a process known as the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Great Cause]] to identify the most legitimate claimant. [[John Balliol]] was pronounced king in the Great Hall of [[Berwick Castle]] on 17 November 1292 and inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 30 November, [[St. Andrew's Day]]. Edward I, who had coerced recognition as [[Lord Paramount of Scotland]], the feudal superior of the realm, steadily undermined John's authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/utk/scotland/conquered.htm |title=Scotland Conquered, 1174<U+2013>1296 |publisher=National Archives}}</ref> In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Instead the Scottish parliament sent envoys to France to negotiate an alliance. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the [[Auld Alliance]] (1295<U+2013>1560). War ensued and King John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. [[Andrew Moray]] and [[William Wallace]] initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in what became known as the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] (1296<U+2013>1328).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/utk/scotland/regained.htm |title=Scotland Regained, 1297<U+2013>1328 |publisher=National Archives of the United Kingdom}}</ref>

The nature of the struggle changed significantly when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick]], killed his rival [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] on 10 February 1306 at [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Dumfries]].<ref>{{cite book|title=King Robert the Bruce|first=A.

Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece. Victory at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, [[Edward Bruce]], brother of the King, was briefly appointed [[High King of Ireland]] during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England. In 1320 the world's first documented [[declaration of independence]], the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], won the support of [[Pope John XXII]], leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.

However, war with England continued for several decades after the death of Bruce. A civil war between the Bruce dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce dynasty was successful, [[David II of Scotland|David II's]] lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] to come to the throne and establish the [[Stewart Dynasty]].<ref name=Barrow>{{cite book |authorlink=G.

In 1603, [[James VI and I|James VI, King of Scots]] inherited the thrones of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and became King James I of England and Ireland, and left [[Edinburgh]] for London.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chronology of Scottish History|publisher=Geddes & Grosset |isbn=1-85534-380-0 |last=Ross |first=David |year=2002 |quote='''1603:''' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves Edinburgh for London |page=56}}</ref> With the exception of a short period under [[the Protectorate]], Scotland remained a separate state, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the [[Covenanters]] over the form of [[Presbyterian church governance|church government]].

In 1698, the Scots attempted an ambitious project to secure a trading colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the [[Darien scheme]]. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa52/Sa52_Scott.pdf |title=Why did the Scottish parliament accept the Treaty of Union? |publisher=Scottish Affairs |accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishhistorysociety.org/departments/scottishhistorysociety/resources/popularoppositiontotheratificationofthetreatyofanglo-scottishunionin1706-7/backgroundtotheissues/ |title=Popular Opposition to the Ratification of the Treaty of Anglo-Scottish Union in 1706-7 |publisher=University of St Andrews}}</ref>

On 22 July 1706, the [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scots Parliament]] and the [[Parliament of England]] and the following year twin [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] were passed by both parliaments to create the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] with effect from 1 May 1707.<ref name=Mackie/>

=== 18th century ===
With trade tariffs with England now abolished, trade blossomed, especially with [[Colonial America]]. The clippers belonging to the [[Glasgow]] [[Tobacco Lords]] were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Until the [[American War of Independence]] in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities |publisher=Virginia Historical Society|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4248011?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102616740771 |jstor=4248011}}</ref> The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] and the ancient clans of the [[Scottish Highlands]] grew, amplifying centuries of division.

[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|left|David Morier's depiction of the [[Battle of Culloden]].]]
The deposed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Stuart]] claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-[[Presbyterian]]s, including Roman Catholics and [[Episcopalian Protestants]]. However, two major [[Jacobite Rising]]s launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the [[Battle of Culloden]], Great Britain's last [[pitched battle]]. This defeat paved the way for large-scale removals of the indigenous populations of the Highlands and Islands, known as the [[Highland Clearances]].

The [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] made Scotland into an intellectual, commercial and industrial powerhouse<ref>"[http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Ec008224b/scotline2.htm Some Dates in Scottish History from 1745 to 1914]", The University of Iowa.</ref><U+2013>so much so [[Voltaire]] said "We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishenlightenment/scotland/index.asp| title =Enlightenment Scotland| publisher =Learning and Teaching Scotland}}</ref> With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent [[British Empire]]. Historian Neil Davidson notes "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland."  Davidson also states "far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland <U+2013> or more precisely, the Lowlands <U+2013> lay at its core."<ref>{{cite book |  title =The Origins of Scottish Nationhood |  author =Neil Davidson(2000)| publisher =Pluto Press| location =London | pages =94<U+2013>95}}</ref>

[[Image:Disruption forming Free Kirk.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Disruption Assembly was painted by [[David Octavius Hill]].]]
After prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]], known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843<U+2013>1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].<ref name=Robb1990>G.

Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.<ref name=Devine2001p91-100>T.

Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the [[First World War]]. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.<ref>Richard J.

The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "[[Red Clydeside]]" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] stronghold, the industrial districts switched to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] by 1922, with a base among the [[Irish Catholic]] working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)</ref>

The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment.<ref>Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914<U+2013>2000'' (2006), pp 34<U+2013>72</ref> Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the [[Second World War]].<ref>Richard J. Finlay, "National identity in Crisis: Politicians, Intellectuals and the 'End of Scotland', 1920<U+2013>1939," ''History,'' June 1994, Vol. 79 Issue 256, pp 242<U+2013>59</ref>

The [[Second World War]] brought renewed prosperity, despite extensive bombing of cities by the Luftwaffe. It saw the invention of radar by [[Robert Watson-Watt]], which was invaluable in the [[Battle of Britain]] as was the leadership at [[RAF Fighter Command]] of [[Air Chief Marshal (UK)|Air Chief Marshal]] [[Hugh Dowding|Sir Hugh Dowding]].<ref>Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914<U+2013>2000'' (2006), pp 162<U+2013>197</ref>

After 1945, Scotland's economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.<ref>Harvie, Christopher ''No Gods and Precious Few Heroes'' (Edward Arnold, 1989) pp 54<U+2013>63.</ref> Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance.

Scotland's [[head of state]] is the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]], currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (since 1952). The [[regnal number]]ing "Elizabeth II" caused [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Scottish controversy|controversy]] around the time of the Queen's coronation because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. A legal action, [[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]] (1953 SC 396), was brought to contest the right of the Queen to entitle herself ''Elizabeth II'' within Scotland, arguing that this was a breach of Article 1 of the Treaty of Union.

[[The Crown]] won the case. It was decided that future British monarchs would be numbered according to either their English or their Scottish predecessors, whichever number is higher.<ref>[[Winston Churchill]], House of Commons [[Hansard|Official Report]] cols 199<U+2013>201, 15 April 1953</ref> For instance any future King James would be styled James VIII (since the last Scottish King James was [[James VII of Scotland|James VII]] (also James II of England, etc.)) while the next King Henry would be King Henry IX throughout the UK even though there have been no Scottish kings of that name.

Scotland has limited [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom as well as representation in the [[UK Parliament]]. Executive and legislative powers have been devolved to, respectively, the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]] at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] in Edinburgh. The United Kingdom Parliament retains power over a set list of areas explicitly specified in the [[Scotland Act 1998]] as [[reserved matters]], including, for example, levels of UK [[UK tax system|taxes]], [[UK social security|social security]], [[UK military|defence]], [[UK international relations|international relations]] and [[UK broadcasting|broadcasting]].<ref name= Gate>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071020091749/http://www.scotland.org/about/fact-file/government/index.html "Government of Scotland Facts"] Scotland.org&nbsp;<U+2014> The Official Online Gateway.

The Scottish Parliament has [[legislative]] authority for all other areas relating to Scotland, as well as [[Tartan Tax|limited power to vary income tax]]. In 2009, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, in a [[BBC Scotland]] interview, indicated that the Scottish Parliament could be given more tax-raising powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2050686.0.0.php|title=Brown opens door to Holyrood tax powers|publisher=Sunday Herald|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=10 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to Westminster by passing a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of [[public services]] compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.<ref>BBC Scotland News Online "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm Scotland begins pub smoking ban]", ''BBC Scotland News'', 26 March 2006.

The Scottish Parliament is a [[unicameral]] legislature with 129 [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|members]] (MSPs), 73 of whom represent individual [[Scottish Parliament constituencies|constituencies]], and are elected on a [[first past the post]] system; 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the [[additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]]. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally five years from 2011<U+2013>16). The Queen appoints one Member of the Scottish Parliament, nominated by the Parliament, to be [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]]. Other ministers are also appointed by the First Minister and serve at his/her discretion.

Scots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: [[Private law|civil]], [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 October 2009, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The [[Court of Session]] is housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the [[Lawnmarket]]. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.<ref>[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp "Court Information"]{{dead link|date=September 2013}} www.scotcourts.gov.uk. Retrieved 26 September 207.</ref> [[District Courts of Scotland|District courts]] were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by [[Justice of the Peace Court]]s from 2008 to 2010. The [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] regulates heraldry.

For many decades the Scots legal system was unique for being the only legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the [[Scottish Parliament]], which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible [[verdict]]s: "[[guilt (law)|guilt]]y", "[[Acquittal|not guilty]]" and "''[[not proven]]''".<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict] ''The Times''. Retrieved 7 August 2008.</ref> Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]], typically with no possibility of [[retrial]] in accordance with the rule of [[double jeopardy]]. There is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]] <U+2013> see the provisions of the [[Double jeopardy#Scotland|Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011]]. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. [[Manslaughter]], in [[England and Wales]], is broadly similar to [[culpable homicide]] in Scotland, and arson is called [[wilful fire raising]].

=== Geology and geomorphology ===
{{Main|Geology of Scotland}}
[[File:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|float|left|thumb|upright|Relief map of Scotland]]
The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by [[glaciation]]. From a geological perspective the country has three main sub-divisions.

The [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].

A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of [[freshwater]] including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low lying dune pasture land.

The [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense [[volcanism]], [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.

The [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=16 November 1990 |accessdate=11 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland <U+2013> Standard Grade Bitesize Revision <U+2013> Ask a Teacher <U+2013> Geography <U+2013> Physical <U+2013> Question From PN |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="Scotland Today <U+00BB> ITKT">{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today " ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=28 December 2006 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archivedate = 6 January 2007}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 4<U+2013>500&nbsp;million years ago.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Tiree, Balephuil Bay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tiree]], one of the sunniest locations in Scotland]]
{{main|Climate of Scotland}}
The climate of Scotland is [[temperate]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, for example [[Labrador]], southern [[Scandinavia]], the Moscow region in Russia, and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] on the opposite side of [[Eurasia]]. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the coldest ever UK temperature of {{convert|-27.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} recorded at [[Braemar]] in the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]], on 11 February 1895.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml BBC Weather: UK Records]{{dead link|date=February 2012}} BBC.co.uk.

In general, the west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic [[ocean currents]] and the colder surface temperatures of the [[North Sea]]. [[Tiree]], in the [[Inner Hebrides]], is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.<ref name=Metext/> Rainfall varies widely across Scotland.

Scotland has a western style [[Open economy|open]] [[mixed economy]] closely linked with the rest of Europe and the wider world.

Domestic rail services within Scotland are operated by [[First ScotRail]]. During the time of [[British Rail]] the West Coast Main Line from [[London Euston]] to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] was electrified in the early 1970s, followed by the East Coast Main Line in the late 1980s. British Rail created the [[ScotRail]] brand. When British Rail existed, many railway lines in Strathclyde were electrified. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive was at the forefront with the acclaimed "largest electrified rail network outside London". Some parts of the network are electrified, but there are no electrified lines in the Highlands, Angus, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Dundee or Aberdeen, or Perth & Kinross, and none of the islands has a rail link (although the railheads at [[Kyle of Lochalsh]] and [[Mallaig]] principally serve the islands).

In addition, Glasgow has had a small integrated subway system since 1896. Completely gutted and modernised between 1977 and 1980, its 15 stations serve just under 40,000 passengers per day. There are plans to extensively refurbish the system in time for the 2014 [[Commonwealth Games]].

[[Healthcare in Scotland]] is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947]] (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. However, even prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state funded health care, provided by the [[Highlands and Islands Medical Service]].<ref>[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/highlands-and-islands-medical-service.html Highlands and Islands Medical Service (HIMS)] www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk.

In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. In addition, there are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about <U+00A3>30,000 per annum.<ref>[http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/introduction.aspx About the NHS in Scotland] NHS Scotland</ref>
