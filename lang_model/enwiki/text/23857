The '''Flor<U+00E9>al class''' is a type of light "sentry frigates" designed for the needs of the [[French Navy]] after the end of the [[Cold War]], ordered in 1989. They  use construction standards of commercial ships. The ships are named after months of the [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]].

== Definition of the requirements ==
After the end of the Cold War, it was felt that the risks of a large-scale military confrontation had all but disappeared. The ''Marine Nationale'' had to face new missions, while its escort avisos from the 80s were aging, and also badly adapted to low-risk zones.

The concept of "sentry frigate" emerged from the will of the French government to protect its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (12 million km<U+00B2>), as defined in the [[Montego Bay]] treaties. Another need was to address matters of humanitarian aid, diplomacy, or naval law enforcement. To address these missions, an onboard helicopter is clearly the optimal solution, provide versatile, swift and long-range capabilities to deliver support, ferry or rescue.

These constraints defined the need for a ship which would be small; extremely stable to allow use of a heavy helicopter in all weather; small crew, while retaining capacities to accommodate navy commandos; light armament; economic and long-range propulsion system.

== Construction ==
To make the ship more economical, civilian construction methods were used at the ''Chantiers de l'Atlantique'' in Saint Nazaire. The ships use the SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) regulations, which require the hull to have eleven watertight compartments. The rules of the [[classification society]] [[Det Norske Veritas]] are used for energy production and safety. The ships were built in series, each with six pre-fabricated parts weighing up to 570 tonnes that were assembled and welded in a dry dock. (The construction method was later used for the ''[[La Fayette class frigate|La Fayette]]'' class). The first trials at sea were carried out in 1991 with an entirely civilian crew, while the ''Marine Nationale'' was only present as an observer.

== Equipment ==
The armament was ordered from the ''DCN Lorient'', a traditional naval provider for the French Navy. The ''Flor<U+00E9>al'' class, though designed to operate in low-risk areas, carry their own armament (they are not dependent on their helicopter).

The most visible piece of armament is the [[French 100 mm naval gun|standard 100 mm multipurpose gun turret]], which is a feature of most modern French warships. It is installed in one block, with the magazine shelter and the targeting computer. All ''Floreal'' frigates are fitted with two [[Exocet]] missile launchers, a Dagaie decoy launcher system, two 20 mm Mod F2 cannons, as well as a complete range of detection and counter-measure electronics.

The helicopter is a naval ''[[Eurocopter Panther|Panther]]'', carrying no armament itself.

== Royal Moroccan Navy ==
The Royal Moroccan Navy ( Marine Royale ) operates 2 Floreal class frigates. The 2 frigates are named after the late Kings Mohammed V and Hassan II. The 2 frigates are accompanied by a total of 3 Panther helicopters.
