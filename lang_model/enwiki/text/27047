==Gameplay==
[[File:Dead or Alive Paradise Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Taking pictures using a camera in the game]]

The game has several gameplay aspects, featured most prominently is the [[minigame]] similar to ''Dead or Alive Xtreme 2''. The mini-games include [[beach volleyball]], [[Swimming pool|pool]] hopping, and [[casino]] games like [[poker]], [[blackjack]] and [[Slot machine|slots]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dead or Alive: Paradise announced|work=Gaming Target|url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=10825|date=2010-01-23}}</ref> The second aspect of the game would be interacting with the girls by mingling with them, giving them presents including swimwear.<ref name="IGN"/> The third aspect is to purchase a camera from the Island Shop and take photographs of the girls which can then be assembled into an album.<ref name="IGN"/> Once the relationship with the girls is on an intimate level, the girls would then present the player with "venus clips" which can be viewed and edited by the player.<ref name="Press Release"/>

==Development==
The previous team leader of [[Team Ninja]], [[Tomonobu Itagaki]] had previously expressed interest in bringing the ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball|Dead or Alive Xtreme]]'' series to handhelds such as the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2004. The game was first revealed in Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' in December 2009.<ref name="IGN"/> A North American release was announced a month later in January 2010.<ref name="Press Release"/>

==Game Demo==
On 11 March 2010, a [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free demo was released on the Japanese [[Playstation Store]], and then distributed by Japanese site 4Gamer and other web sites. Accordingly to [[IGN]], the demo features a sample of the game's Gravure Mode, where the player chooses a character, a swimsuit and a situation to take photos. On the demo, Hitomi is the only available character, with two bikinis and three situations. Unlike in the full version, the pictures cannot be saved in the demo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sample Dead or Alive Paradise in advance|work=IGN|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/107/1076706p1.html|date=2011-03-28}}</ref> The demo can currently be downloaded on PSP demo specialized web sites, as well as in the game's official Japanese site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dead or Alive Paradise Demo [PSP] with Download Links|work=[[YouTube]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDWm4ja0kg|date=2011-04-02}}</ref>

==ESRB Controversy==
The [[ESRB]], on a polemic post about ''Dead or Alive Paradise'', classified the game as "creepy voyeurism" and "bizarre, misguided notions of what women really want", saying also that "Paradise cannot mean straddling felled tree trunks in dental-floss thongs".<ref name="ESRB Outburst">{{cite web|title=ESRB regrets DOA: Paradise outburst|work=Eurogamer|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/esrb-regrets-doa-paradise-outburst|date=2011-03-28}}</ref> Later, the post was changed into something more neutral, and ESRB apologized saying the first post was posted "in error", considering it "improperly" and filled with "subjective language".<ref name="ESRB Outburst"/>

Director Yoshinori Ueda said to [[Eurogamer]] that the game isn't supposed to be softcore pornography, neither degrading towards women. In his own words:

''"That's certainly not something we're intentionally going for", "From our perspective, we're trying to make beautiful women, that has been the focus - we want our characters to be beautiful. The DOA characters are strong and that they look the way they do is based on trying to bring out the beauty of women", "We're certainly not trying to degrade women. They have beautiful bodies. We're trying to show off the beauty of their bodies but we're not trying to be degrading about it - we're trying to show that they are beautiful characters.",'' and ''"It's not that we were trying to make softcore porn. That's definitely not the goal"''.<ref>{{cite web|title=DOA Paradise goal was not soft porn|work=Eurogamer|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/doa-paradise-goal-was-not-soft-porn|date=2011-03-28}}</ref>
