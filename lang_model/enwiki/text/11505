'''Werner Voss''' ({{Lang-de|Werner Vo<U+00DF>}}) (April 13, 1897&nbsp;<U+2013> September 23, 1917) was a [[World War I]] German [[flying ace]], a friend and rival of the famous "Red Baron", [[Manfred von Richthofen]]. A skilled pilot and aggressive fighter, he was considered by some to be the one pilot who could match von Richthofen.<ref name="Shores p. 14.">Shores 1983, p. 14.</ref> Although absent on leave during [[Bloody April]], when German aces fattened their victory lists on the disproportionate British losses, Voss's victory score was second among German aces at the time he was [[killed in action]]. His final combat is considered one of the most momentous and exciting [[dogfight]]s in history. After he fell in solo opposition to eight British aces, he was described by his preeminent foe in the final combat, [[James McCudden]], as "the bravest German airman".

==Early life==
Werner Voss was born in [[Krefeld]], Germany, on 13 April 1897; he was the youngest of three sons and two daughters of an industrial dyer. His older siblings were Margret Rose, Katherine,<ref name=pourlemerite>[http://www.pourlemerite.org/wwi/air/voss.html "Werner Voss"] ''The Blue Max website,'' 2012. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.</ref> Max, and Otto.<ref name=pfalz>Herris 2001, pp. 87-88.</ref> His family home was a comfortable two-story house with surrounding grounds. He was expected to carry on the family trade when grown. When he finished his schooling, he volunteered for the Krefeld Militia. He served there until the outbreak of World War I caused his reassignment.<ref name=pourlemerite/>

==Military service==
===From cavalry to clouds===
Voss enlisted in 1914 at the age of 17 in the 2nd Westphalian [[Hussar]] Regiment Nr. 11, and served on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].<ref name="O'Connor p. 162.">O'Connor 2001, p. 162.</ref> He was promoted to ''[[Gefreiter]]'' on 27 January 1915, and raised to ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' when barely 18 years of age, on 18 May 1915. He was also awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class during this time.<ref name=lines223/>

Following the disbandment of his regiment,<ref name="Shores p. 14."/> Voss transferred to the ''[[Luftstreitkr<U+00E4>fte]]'' (German Air Service) on 1 August 1915, joining ''Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 7'' (Training Detachment 7) in [[Cologne]]. On 1 September, he began learning to fly. A gifted natural pilot, he was immediately enrolled as an instructor at FEA 7 upon graduating on 12 February 1916. On 2 March, he was promoted to ''[[Vizefeldwebel]]''.<ref name=lines223>Franks et al 1993, pp. 223-225.</ref>

===Aerial combat===
On 10 March 1916,<ref name=lines223/> ''Vizefeldwebel'' Voss was posted to ''Kampfstaffel'' 20 of ''[[Kampfgeschwader]]'' IV, and served as an observer before he was allowed to fly himself, receiving his pilot's badge on 28 May 1916.<ref name=albatros16/> [[Commission (document)|Commissioned]] on 9 September 1916, he transferred to single-seater [[Scout (aircraft)|scout]] aircraft and was posted to [[Oswald Boelcke]]'s ''[[Jagdstaffel 2]]'' on 21 November 1916.<ref name=circus32>VanWyngarden 2004, p. 32.</ref> It was there he began a lifelong friendship with another young pilot in the squadron, [[Manfred von Richthofen]]; they would later exchanged family visits on leave,<ref name=triplane12/> and the Red Baron hosted the Voss family at the squadron's airfield.<ref name=pourlemerite/>

Voss had a love for mechanical engineering, and was an avid rider of [[motorcycle]]ds.<ref name=pourlemerite/> He also could often be found in the [[hangar]] working on his machine beside the mechanics while dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia.<ref name=triplane13/> His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his [[Albatros D.III]] with both a [[swastika]] and a heart for good luck.<ref>Franks 2000, pp. 17, 92.</ref><ref name=jasta30/>

Voss achieved his first two aerial victories on 27 November 1916.<ref name=lines223/> He scored rapidly during February and March 1917; of the 15 victories credited to his ''jasta'' during March, 11 fell under his guns.<ref name=jasta30>VanWyngarden 2007, pp. 30-31.</ref> For his feats, he was awarded the Knight's Cross with Swords of the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] on 17 March<ref name=circus32>VanWyngarden 2004, p. 32.</ref> and the ''[[Pour le Merite]]'' on 7<ref name=albatros16>Franks 2000, p. 16-17.</ref> or 8 April 1917.<ref name=pourlemerite/> It was customary to award leave to a Blue Max winner, so Voss immediately left for his vacation, and did not return to combat until 5 May. He thus was out of action during [[Bloody April]], the most intense air fighting of the war, when the British suffered heavy air casualties inflicted by German aviators.<ref name=albatros16/> Richthofen, who had scored 11 victories before Voss began his own tally, achieved 13 victories during his absence.<ref name=lines187>Franks et al 1993, pp. 187-189.</ref> Referring to his "dear friend", Richthofen stated: "He was...my most redoubtable competitor."<ref>Richthofen 2007, p. 126.</ref>

Upon his return from leave, Voss was dissatisfied with his commanding officer, [[Franz Walz]], whom he considered insufficiently aggressive. Voss disregarded military procedure and went outside the [[chain of command]] to petition higher headquarters for Walz's removal. The response to this [[insubordination]] was to fire Voss from ''Jasta 2'' with a severe reprimand. However, given his record, including the four victories scored after his return from leave, he was not relieved from duty. Instead, Voss was sent to command ''[[Jagdstaffel 5]]'' on 20 May 1917. On 29 May, he took temporary command of ''[[Jagdstaffel 29]]''. Five days later, he was given temporary command of ''[[Jagdstaffel 14]]''.<ref>VanWyngarden 2004, pp. 30, 32.</ref> While downing one of [[No. 206 Squadron RAF|6 Naval Squadron]] [[Royal Naval Air Service|RNAS]], Voss was both slightly wounded and forced down on 6 June 1917 by Flt Sub-Lt [[Christopher Draper]] of that squadron, but soon returned to duty.<ref>Franks 2000, p. 13.</ref> On 30 July, Voss moved to a permanent command, ''[[Jagdstaffel 10]]'' in Richthofen's Flying Circus, [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' I]] (JG I), relieving [[Ernst Freiherr von Althaus]] at Richthofen's request. Voss was known as charismatic and inspirational in his daring, but there were doubts that he would be an effective unit leader. Described as "mercurial", he was impatient with the paperwork and responsibilities of command.<ref name=circus32/> He was a casual dresser, but when flying would be well-dressed beneath his aviation gear, so that he would be presentable in case of a forced landing.<ref name=pourlemerite/>

[[Image:VossTriplane.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The famous Fokker Triplane of Werner Voss. Its low wing loading gave it maneuverability and a high climb rate.]]

Voss was one of the test pilots for the F.I prototype which developed into the [[Fokker Dr.I]] [[triplane]]. In late August 1917, that [[rotary engine]] prototype<U+2014>serial number 103/17<U+2014>was assigned to Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown [[Fighter kite|Japanese fighting kites]] with his cousins in Krefeld; the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose of his Dr.I with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache.<ref name=triplane12>Franks; VanWyngarden 2001, p. 12.</ref> Voss also still had a Pfalz D.III assigned to him.<ref name=pfalz/>

By 11 September 1917, Voss had raised his victory total to 47, second only to the Red Baron's 61.<ref name="Shores p. 14."/><ref name=lines187/>

===Last flight===
Voss was due for leave on 23 September 1917; one of his fellow pilots observed: "He had the nervous instability of a cat. I think it would be fair to say he was flying on his nerves."<ref>Guttman 2008, p. 21.</ref> Brothers Max and Otto Voss arrived at ''Jasta 10'' to accompany Werner home. The young ace was fatigued and told his brothers he was eagerly anticipating his time off. He had already shot down a No. 57 Squadron [[Airco DH.4|DH 4]] bomber on a morning patrol. As it was, he ate lunch with his brothers<U+2014>soup, black bread, coffee, and cake. His brothers noted his haggard appearance. After the meal, the three Voss brothers posed before Werner's camera, which was equipped with a timed shutter release. However, Voss went out on a further patrol before departing on leave, with the aim of bumping his victory total to 50 before he left. He wore a colorful civilian silk dress shirt beneath his knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Merite was at his throat. He was to lead one of the two scheduled patrols. After takeoff, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, soon outdistanced his two wingmen, who were flying slower outmoded Pfalz D.IIIs.<ref name=hero>[http://www.letletlet-warplanes.com/2008/06/19/werner-voss-hero-or-super-hero/ The Last Stand] Retrieved: 20 July 2013.</ref>

A dogfight developed over [[Langemark-Poelkapelle|Poelkapelle]] at about 1830 hours. A cloud layer at 10,000 feet overcast the area. British [[Sopwith Camel]]s, as well as some [[SPAD]]s and [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]]s, were patrolling under the overcast. Two flights of elite [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56 Squadron]] formed a lower layer of British patrols at 6,000 feet altitude. Below that, Lt. [[Harold A. Hamersley]], flying the Tail End Charlie position in a [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]] formation, turned to help what he believed to be a [[Nieuport]] threatened by German [[Albatros|Albatri]], firing a short burst of machine-gun fire. The "Nieuport", Voss's misidentified Fokker Triplane, rounded on Hamersley and raked him with [[MG 08|Spandau]] fire. Hamersley flung his SE.5a into a spin that went inverted, with Voss continuing to fire, holing his wings and engine cowling. Lt. [[Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts]], a squadronmate of Hamersley, rushed to his aid. Within seconds, Voss shredded Chidlaw-Roberts's rudder bar, also driving him out of the fray into a forced landing.<ref name=hero/>

[[File:Se5McCudden.jpg|thumb|right|350px|McCudden's SE.5a. The SE.5a's speed of 130 mph made it a lot faster than the Fokker Triplane.]]

While they fell away seriously shot about, and the rest of 60 Squadron exited the scene, Voss was engaged by six Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5as of B Flight, 56 Squadron. [[Flight commander (position)|Flight Commander]] Capt. [[James McCudden]] and his wingmen attacked in pairs from 1,000 feet above Voss. In a pincer movement, McCudden hooked into an assault from the right while his wingman, Lt. [[Arthur Rhys Davids]], came in from the left. Capt. [[Keith Muspratt]] and Capt. [[Reginald Hoidge]] took high and low positions to help box Voss in. Lt. [[Richard Maybery]] and Lt V.P. Cronyn were poised to dive if the triplane tried to flee. To further worsen Voss's situation, there was a patrol of Camels beneath him.<ref name=hero/>

To the attackers' surprise, Voss did not try to escape the aerial trap. Instead, he flicked his triplane about to dodge McCudden's attack, holed its wings, then cut in behind Hoidge to hole his SE.5a. Still Voss did not try to break away from the fight; the British repeated the "box maneuver" at least three more times that day, but the German ace stayed to fight.<ref name=hero/>

Voss instantly fired back at McCudden during a head-on firing pass, then closed with Cronyn and riddled his machine's oil sump from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Then Muspratt's engine locked up after losing its coolant to Voss's bullets, and he glided away. There were two fewer enemy to contend with; Voss had now driven four British pilots and craft from the fight.<ref name=hero/>

Other participants arrived. Capt. [[Geoffrey Hilton Bowman]] led 56 Squadron's C Flight into the fray. Also, another German ace, [[Carl Menckhoff]] of ''[[Jagdstaffel 3]]'', flying an [[Albatros D.V]], broke through the British cordon and attempted to assist Voss but was quickly downed unhurt by Rhys Davids's bullet through his engine.<ref>Franks et al. 1992, p. 224.</ref><ref name=hero/>

At one point, Voss was caught in a crossfire by at least five of his attackers but seemed unhurt. At about this point, Mayberry withdrew, his SE.5as upper right-hand [[longeron]] holed in several places. By now, Voss and his remaining six opponents had swirled down to 2,000 feet. At times, Voss had the altitude advantage over his foes, but he did not try to escape the fight. Using the triplane's superior rate of climb and its ability to [[slip turn]], Voss managed to evade his opponents and return to battle. He was able to turn at high speeds and attack those behind him.<ref name=hero/> As Bowman later noted about his only shot at Voss: "'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his nose up slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of this amazing stunt appeared to have any effect on the controllability of his machine."<ref name=camel>Guttman 2008, p. 22.</ref> Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight.<ref name=hero/>

After flying past McCudden in a head-on confrontation, however, Voss's Fokker was hit with bullets on the starboard side by Hoidge. In the meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he then rejoined combat with about 500 feet height advantage on Voss's altitude of 1,500 feet. The British ace pounced, with a long flat dive onto the triplane's tail. At [[point-blank range]], he ripped the German machine end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again raked the German aircraft before missing a mid-air collision by inches. By now, the Fokker's engine had stopped. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overshot him at about 1,000 feet altitude and lost sight of his prey. Bowman saw the Fokker in what could have been a landing glide, right up until it stalled, flipped inverted and nose down, then pancaked in, leaving only the rudder intact.<ref name=hero/>

McCudden recalled:  "I saw him go into a fairly steep dive and so I continued to watch, and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments, for it seemed to me that it literally went into powder."<ref name="theaerodrome.com">[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/voss.php "Werner Voss."] ''The Aerodrome,'' 2012. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.</ref>

Voss had fought the RFC aces for 10 minutes, eluding them and achieving hits on nearly every SE.5a.<ref name="Shores p. 17.">Shores 1983, p. 17.</ref><ref name=triplane16>Franks; VanWyngarden 2001, pp. 16-19.</ref> He crashed near Plum Farm north of Frezenberg in [[Belgium]] at about 1840 hours, and was buried where he fell, just behind the British trenches, by a British funeral party. He was interred without a coffin or military honors<ref name=triplane16/> the morning after his death.<ref name=hero/> The location of his grave was lost in subsequent fighting.<ref name=triplane16/>

==Legacy==
When the British aces of 56 Squadron learned their fallen foe's identity, they were quick to pay public tribute to him. The leading British pilot he fought that day, James McCudden [[Victoria Cross|VC]], expressed sincere regret at Voss's death: "His flying was wonderful, his courage magnificent and in my opinion he was the bravest German airman whom it has been my privilege to see fight." The dogfight's victor, Arthur Rhys-Davids, who himself would fall in combat just one month later, had said to McCudden, "If I could only have brought him down alive."<ref name="theaerodrome.com" /><ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/rhys_davids.php "Arthur Rhys Davids."] ''The Aerodrome,'' 2012. Retrieved: 18 June 2012.</ref>

In the aftermath of the dogfight, V. P. Cronyn recorded his private reaction in a letter to his father:

{{quote|After Mess I went up to the hangar to have a look at my machine. It was a write-off and no mistake. The right lower longeron had a bullet hole through it, while the left lower was nearly cut in two...there was only about a quarter of an inch thickness left in one place, while about 18 inches further along three bullets had cut right through. The main spars were shot through, and one of the ribs of the tailplane was fractured.... There were also several other bullet holes in wings and fuselage. Besides these few details, the machine was all OK! It was a miracle he didn't hit me in the engine. As a matter of fact he got one in my prop. I went to bed as soon as I had a good look over the machine, but could hardly sleep a wink. I just lay in bed perspiring, though it was quite a cold night.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110608230803/http://blindkat.hegewisch.net/voss/56.html "The Last Dogfight."] ''web.archive.org,'' 2012.
