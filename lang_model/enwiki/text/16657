'''''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test''''' is a work of [[literary journalism]] by [[Tom Wolfe]], published in 1968.  Using techniques from the genre of [[hysterical realism]] and pioneering [[new journalism]], the "nonfiction novel" tells the story of [[Ken Kesey]] and his band of [[Merry Pranksters]].  The book follows the Pranksters across the country driving in a [[psychedelic]] painted school bus dubbed "[[Further (bus)|Further]]" (called "Furthur" in the book due to an initial misspelling on the bus' placard), reaching what they considered to be personal and collective revelations through the use of [[LSD]] and other [[psychedelic drugs]].  The book also describes the [[Acid Tests]], early performances by [[The Grateful Dead]], and Kesey's exile to Mexico.

In 1968, Eliot Fremont-Smith of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' "not simply the best book on hippies<U+2026> [but also] the essential book."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D12FF3B54157493C0A81783D85F4C8685F9 | title=Books of The Times; Freak-Out in Day-Glo | author=Eliot Fremont-Smith | date=1968-08-12 | publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
