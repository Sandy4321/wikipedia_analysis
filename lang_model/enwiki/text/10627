'''''Boletus edulis''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as '''porcini''' or '''cep''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus, and the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Boletus]]''. Widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] across Europe, Asia, and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere, although it has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to southern Africa and New Zealand. Several closely-related European mushrooms formerly thought to be [[variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[form (botany)|forms]] of ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' have been shown using [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis to be distinct species. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (''Boletus edulis'' var. ''grandedulis'') is a large, darker-coloured variant that was first formally identified in 2008.

The fungus grows in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]]s and tree [[plantations]], forming [[symbiotic]] [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] associations with living trees by enveloping sheaths of fungal tissue around their underground roots. The fungus produces [[spore]]-bearing [[basidiocarps|fruit bodies]] above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body consists of a large and imposing brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] which can reach {{convert|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|1|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} in weight. Like other [[bolete]]s, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores are released at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface of the ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' fruit body is whitish when young, but ages to a greenish-yellow. The stout [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, is white or yellowish in colour, up to 25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) tall and {{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and partially covered with a raised network pattern, or [[wikt:reticulate|reticulations]].

Prized as an ingredient in various foods, ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' is an [[edible mushroom]] held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is low in [[fat]] and digestible [[carbohydrate]]s, and high in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|mineral]]s and [[dietary fibre]]. Although it is sold commercially, it has not been successfully grown in cultivation. Available fresh in autumn in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southern Europe]], it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. Keeping its flavour after drying, it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. ''Boletus edulis'' is one of the few fungi that is sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of [[organic compound]]s with a diverse spectrum of [[biological activity]], including the steroid derivative [[ergosterol]], a [[lectin|sugar binding protein]], [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] compounds, [[antioxidant]]s, and [[phytochelatin]]s, which give the organism resistance to toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].

''Boletus edulis'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Boletus]]''. In [[Rolf Singer]]'s [[biological classification|classification]] of the [[Agaricales]] mushrooms, it is also the type species of [[Section (biology)#Ranks in botany|section]] ''Boletus'', a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by a number of characteristics: a mild-tasting white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised netted pattern over at least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown  or olive-brown [[spore print]]; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, and that initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and [[cystidia]] that are not strongly coloured.<ref name=Singer1986>{{cite book |author=Singer R. |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy.|edition= 4th rev.|publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books|location=Koenigstein, Germany |year=1986|page=779|isbn=3-87429-254-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Smith AH, Thiers HD. |year=1971 |title=The Boletes of Michigan |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=University of Michigan Press|page=221|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc;cc=fung1tc;idno=agk0838.0001.001;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=229;page=root;size=s|accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis published in 2006 established that the bolete mushrooms are all [[monophyly|derived from a common ancestor]],  and established the [[Boletales]] as an [[order (biology)|order]] separate from the Agaricales.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Binder M, Hibbett DS. |year=2006 |title= Molecular systematics and biological diversification of Boletales|journal=Mycologia |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=971<U+2013>81 |doi=10.3852/mycologia.98.6.971 |pmid=17486973 |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/reprint/98/6/971.pdf|accessdate=2009-11-03|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Common names===
[[Common name]]s for ''Boletus edulis'' vary by region. The standard Italian name ''porcini'' means "piglets" in [[Italian language|Italian]], and echoes the term ''suilli'', literally 'hog mushrooms', used by the Ancient Romans,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'', Bk.16, 11, 31: 'Such is the multiplicity of products in addition to the acorn that are borne by hard-oaks; but they also produce edible fungi (''boletos'') and hog-mushrooms (''suillos''que).'

[[Image:Boletus edulis herkkutatti halki.jpg|thumb|alt=Both halves of a thick-stemmed bisected mushroom.|Cross-section showing white flesh, broad stem, and spore tubes on the underside of the cap]]
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of this mushroom is 7<U+2013>30&nbsp;cm (3<U+2013>12&nbsp;in) broad at maturity. Slightly sticky to touch, it is convex in shape when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin, and continues to darken as it matures. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, is 8<U+2013>25&nbsp;cm (3.5<U+2013>10&nbsp;in) in height, and up to {{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick<U+2014>rather large in comparison to the cap;<ref name=Kozikowski1996/> it is club-shaped, or bulges out in the middle. It is finely [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]] on the upper portion, but smooth or irregularly ridged on the lower part. The under surface of the cap is made of thin tubes, the site of [[spore]] production; they are {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow.<ref name=Grund1976/> The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small<U+2014>roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre.<ref name=Tylutki1987II>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.

''Boletus edulis'' is considered one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table as there are no poisonous species that closely resemble it.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> The most similar mushroom may be the Devil's bolete (''[[Boletus satanas]]''), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising.<ref name="Carluccio03" /> However, it is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable ''[[Tylopilus felleus]]'', but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini it is a whitish net-like pattern on a brownish stalk whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> It can also resemble the "bolete-like"  ''[[Gyroporus castaneus]]'', which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical to spindle-shaped, with dimensions of 12<U+2013>17 by 5<U+2013>7&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]]. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are produced in a layer lining the tubes, and arrange themselves so that their ends are facing the center of the tube; this layer of cells is known technically as a [[hymenium]]. The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to 4 spores, and measure 25<U+2013>30 by 8<U+2013>10&nbsp;<U+00B5>m. Another cell type present in the hymenium are the [[cystidia]], larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the hymenium, and act as air traps, regulating humidity.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexopoulos CJ, Mims CW, Blackwell M.| title=Introductory Mycology | year=1996 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York, New York|page=495 | isbn=0471522295}}</ref> ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' has pleurocystidia (cystidia located on the face of a pore) that are thin-walled, roughly spindle-shaped to [[ventricose]], and measure 30<U+2013>45 by 7<U+2013>10&nbsp;<U+00B5>m; the hymenium does not have cheilocystidia<U+2014>cells found on the edges of the pores.<ref name=Grund1976>{{cite book |title=Nova Scotian Boletes |last=Grund DW, Harrison AK. |year=1976 |publisher=J.

==Habitat and distribution==
[[Image:Boletus edulis 11.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Lithuania]]|alt=A mushroom with a brown smooth cap the shape of a halved sphere, atop a thick, dirty white stem. The mushroom is growing on a sloping patch of ground amongst moss, twigs and other forest debris; trees can be faintly seen in the background.]]
The fruit bodies of ''Boletus edulis'' can grow singly or in small clusters of two or three specimens. The mushroom's habitat consists of areas dominated by pine (''[[Pinus]]'' spp.), spruce (''[[Picea]]'' spp.), hemlock (''[[Tsuga]]'' spp.)  and fir (''[[Abies]]'' spp.) trees, although other hosts include [[chestnut]], [[Chrysolepis|chinquapin]], [[beech]], ''[[Keteleeria]]'' spp., ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' spp., and [[oak]].

===Fruit body production===
Although Italian folklore holds that porcini sprout up at the time of the new moon,<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> a number of research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn, their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature.<ref name=Hall1998/> Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a "bolete year".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S, Persson O. | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, England|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=100}}</ref> A 2004 [[field study]] indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salerni E, Perini C.|year=2004 |title=Experimental study for increasing productivity of ''Boletus edulis'' s.l. in Italy |journal=Forest Ecology and Management |volume=201 |issue=2<U+2013>3 |pages=161<U+2013>70|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2004.06.027}}</ref> corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study;<ref name=Masuka1996>{{cite journal |author=Masuka AJ. |year=1996 |title=Dynamics of mushroom (''Boletus edulis'') production in pine plantations in Zimbabwe |journal= JASSA, Journal of Applied Science in Southern Africa |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=69<U+2013>76}}</ref> removal of the litter layer on the [[forest floor]] appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baar J, Ter Braak CJF.|year=1996 |title=Ectomycorrhizal sporocarp occurrence as affected by manipulation of litter and humus layers in Scots pine stands of different age |journal=Applied Soil Ecology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=61<U+2013>73|doi= 10.1016/0929-1393(96)00097-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Baar J, de Vries FW. |year=1995 |title=Effects of manipulation of litter and humus layer on ectomycorrhizal colonization potential in Scots pine stands of different age |journal=Mycorrhiza |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=267<U+2013>72 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k505pr50v0732860/fulltext.pdf?page=1 |doi=10.1007/BF00204960 |format=First page preview PDF}}</ref> A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21&nbsp;mm or 0.8&nbsp;in) occurred when the [[relative air humidity]] was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40%.

===Mycorrhizal associations===
''Boletus edulis'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l<U+2014>it is in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of plants ("hosts"), in which the fungus exchanges [[mineral]]s extracted from the environment for [[carbon fixation|fixed carbon]] from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: in the case of the [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese Chestnut]], the formation of mycorrhizae with ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist [[water stress]], and increases leaf [[succulent plants|succulence]], leaf area, and water-holding ability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Quan L, Lei Z-P. |year=2000 |title=A study on effect of ectomycorrhizae on promoting ''Castanea mollissima'' resistance to drought and its mechanism |journal=Forest Research |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=249<U+2013>56 |issn=1001-1498|language=Chinese}}</ref> The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing [[wikt:rootlet|rootlets]] of the host, forming so-called "ectomycorrhizae"; the fungal [[hypha]]e emanate throughout the soil, effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption, and the fungus penetrates between cells of the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] to facilitate nutrient exchange.

The mushroom has been noted to commonly co-occur with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or ''[[Amanita rubescens|A.&nbsp;rubescens]]'', although it is unclear whether this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements.<ref name=Hall1998/> An association has also been reported between ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' and ''[[Amanita excelsa var. spissa|Amanita excelsa]]'' on ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hall IR, Wang Y, Amicucci A. |year=2003 |title=Cultivation of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=21 |issue=10|pages=433<U+2013>38 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(03)00204-X|pmid=14512229}}</ref> A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded  "Factors triggering formation of mycorrhizae and fructification of porcini appear to be too complex to be simply explained on the basis of the amount of fungal mycelia in the soil."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peinter U, Iotti M, Klotz P, Bonuso E, Zambonelli A. |year=2007 |title=Soil fungal communities in a ''Castanea sativa'' (chestnut) forest producing large quantities of ''Boletus edulis sensu lato'' (porcini): where is the mycelium of porcini? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=880<U+2013>89 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01208.x|pmid=17359260}}</ref>

===Heavy metal contamination===
''Boletus edulis'' is known to be able to tolerate and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], such as soil that might be found near [[smelting|metal smelters]]. The mushroom's resistance to heavy metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a [[phytochelatin]]<U+2014>an [[oligopeptide]] whose production is induced after exposure to metal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Collin-Hansen C, Pedersen SA, Andersen RA, Steinnes E. |year=2007 |title=First report of phytochelatins in a mushroom: induction of phytochelatins by metal exposure in ''Boletus edulis'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=161<U+2013>74|doi=10.3852/mycologia.99.2.161 |pmid=17682769}}</ref>  Phytochelatins are [[chelation|chelating agents]], capable of forming [[coordination complex|multiple bonds]] with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.

==Culinary uses==
''Boletus edulis'', like its name implies, is an [[edible mushroom]]. Italian chef and restaurateur [[Antonio Carluccio]] has described it as representing "the wild mushroom ''par excellence''", and hails it as the most rewarding of all fungi in the kitchen for its taste and versatility.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> Considered a choice edible, particularly in France, Germany and Italy,<ref name=Zeitl76/> it was widely written about by the Roman writers [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Martial]], although ranked below the esteemed ''[[Amanita caesarea]]''.

The flavour has been described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of [[sourdough]].  Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbor [[maggot]]s (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age.

Like other boletes, porcini can be dried by being strung separately on twine and hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen.

A 1998 estimate suggests the total annual worldwide consumption of ''Boletus edulis'' and closely-related species (''B.&nbsp;aereus'', ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'', and ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus'') to be between 20,000 and 100,000 tons.<ref name=Hall1998/> Approximately 2,700&nbsp;tonnes (3,000&nbsp;tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988 according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it does not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors.<ref name=Hall2003/> They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand.

In the vicinity of [[Borgo Val di Taro|Borgotaro]] in the [[Province of Parma]] of northern Italy, the four species ''Boletus edulis'', ''B.&nbsp;aereus'', ''B.&nbsp;aestivalis'' and ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed ''Fungo di Borgotaro''. Here, these mushrooms have been collected for centuries, and exported commercially. However, due to recent trends in the globalization of mushroom trade, most of the porcini commercially available in Italy or exported by Italy no longer originate from Italy. Porcini and other mushrooms are imported into Italy from various locations, especially China and eastern European countries; these are then often re-exported under the "Italian porcini" label.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sitta N, Floriani M. |year=2008 |title=Nationalization and globalization trends in the wild mushroom commerce of Italy with emphasis on porcini (''Boletus edulis'' and allied species) |journal=Economic Botany |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=307<U+2013>22 |doi=10.1007/s12231-008-9037-4 |doi_brokendate=2009-11-06 }}</ref><ref name=Boa2004>{{cite book |author= Boa E. |title=Wild Edible Fungi: A Global Overview of Their Use and Importance to People (Non-Wood Forest Products) |publisher=Food & Agriculture Organization of the UN |location=Rome, Italy |year=2004 |pages=96<U+2013>97 |isbn=92-5-105157-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zd2NlcNZgvcC&lpg=PA97&dq=boletus%20edulis&lr=&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q=boletus%20edulis&f=false|accessdate=2009-10-30}}</ref> 

In Italy, the disconnect with local production has had an adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcini mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus ''[[Tylopilus]]'', which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from ''Boletus''. ''Tylopilus'' species typically have a very bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini they are mixed with.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sitta N. |year=2000 |title=Presence of ''Tylopilus'' into dried "Porcini" mushrooms from China |journal=Micologia Italiana |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=96<U+2013>99 |issn=0390-0460|language=Italian}}</ref>

Ergosterol peroxide is a [[steroid]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] with a wide spectrum of [[biological activity]], including  [[antimicrobial]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] activity, and [[cytotoxicity]] to various tumor [[cell line]]s grown in [[in vitro|laboratory culture]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Krzyczkowskia W, Malinowskaa E, Suchockib P, Klepsa J, Olejnikd M, Herold F. |year=2008 |title=Isolation and quantitative determination of ergosterol peroxide in various edible mushroom species |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=351<U+2013>55 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.06.075}}</ref>

The mushroom also contains a sugar-binding [[protein]], or [[lectin]], that has affinity for the sugars [[xylose]] and [[melibiose]]. The lectin is [[mitogenic]]<U+2014>that is, it can stimulate cells to begin the process of [[cell division]], resulting in [[mitosis]]. Further, the lectin has [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] properties: it inhibits the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zheng S, Li C, Ng TB, Wang HX. |year=2007 |title=A lectin with mitogenic activity from the edible wild mushroom ''Boletus edulis'' |journal=Process Biochemistry |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1620<U+2013>24|doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2007.09.004}}</ref> Other studies suggest that ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' also has antiviral activity against ''[[Vaccinia]]'' virus<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kandefer-Szersen M, Kawecki Z, Salata B, Witek M. |year=1980 |title=Mushrooms as a source of substances with antiviral activity |journal=Acta Mycologica |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=215<U+2013>20|langauge=Polish|issn=0001-625X}}</ref> and [[tobacco mosaic virus]] grown in culture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li D, Zhao W-H, Kong B-H, Ye M, Chen H-R. |year=2009 |title=Inhibition effects of the extract and polysaccharide in macrofungus on TMV |journal= Journal of Yunnan Agricultural University |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=175<U+2013>80|issn=1004-390X}}</ref> Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of [[viral replication]], and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Piraino FF.|year=2006 |title=Emerging antiviral drugs from medicinal mushrooms |journal= International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=101<U+2013>14 |issn=1521-9437}}</ref>

The fruit bodies have a high [[antioxidant|antioxidative]] capacity, due probably to a combination of various [[organic acid]]s (such as [[oxalic acid|oxalic]], [[citric acid|citric]], [[malic acid|malic]], [[succinic acid|succinic]] and [[fumaric acid]]s), [[polyphenol|phenolic compounds]] and [[alkaloid]]s; the highest antioxidative capacity is in the mushroom caps.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ribeiroa B, Lopesa R, Andradea PB, Seabraa RM, Gon<U+00E7>alvesa, Baptistab P, Quelhasa I, Valent<U+00E3>o P. |year=2008 |title=Comparative study of phytochemicals and antioxidant potential of wild edible mushroom caps and stipes  |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages= 47<U+2013>56 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.01.054}}</ref> Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528&nbsp;mg of the antioxidant compound [[ergothioneine]] per kg of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ey J, Sch<U+00F6>mig E, Taubert D. |title=Dietary sources and antioxidant effects of ergothioneine |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=16 |pages=6466<U+2013>74 |year=2007 |pmid=17616140 |doi=10.1021/jf071328f}}</ref> Porcini were thought to have anticancer properties according to Hungarian research conducted in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lucas EH, Montesono R, Pepper MS, Hafner M, Sablon E. |year=1957 |title= Tumor inhibitors in ''Boletus edulis'' and other holobasidiomycetes |journal=Antibiotics and Chemotherapy |volume=7 |pages=1<U+2013>4}}</ref> but later investigations in the United States did not support this.<ref name=Lamaison05/>
