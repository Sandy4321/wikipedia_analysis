Known as the "Thrilla from Camilla",<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2001/playoffs/news/2001/05/16/closer_look/ Toronto finds out how Sixers' Jones got his nickname]</ref> he played competitive high school basketball in the tiny town of [[Camilla, Georgia]]. He spent two impressive years at the [[University of Georgia]], becoming the first [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] to lead the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] in scoring since [[Vern Fleming]] in [[1984]]. Additionally, he was the first sophomore in school history to score 1,000 points since [[Dominique Wilkins]] did so in [[1981]]. That year, he was also selected to represent the U.S. in the [[1998]] [[Goodwill Games]].

Declaring himself eligible for the [[1999 NBA Draft]], he was selected by the [[Atlanta Hawks]] with the 27th overall pick, but was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], where he spent two years, one of which he went to the NBA finals, where he contributed solidly off the bench.
