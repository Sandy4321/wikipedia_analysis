'''Maya stelae''' (singular ''stela'') were monuments fashioned by the [[Maya civilization]] of ancient [[Mesoamerica]]. They consisted of tall sculpted stone shafts and were often associated with low circular stones now labelled as altars.<ref name="Miller99p9">Miller 1999, p.9.</ref> The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] (AD 250 - AD 900),<ref name="Miller99p9"/> and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.235.</ref> The sculptural tradition that produced the [[Stele|stelae]] emerged fully formed and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments.<ref>Miller 1999, p.78.</ref> The earliest dated stela to ever have been found ''[[in situ]]'' in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]].<ref>Miller 1999, p.88. Olmedo Vera 1999, p.24.</ref> During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.<ref name="Stuart96p149">Stuart 1996, p.149.</ref>

Stelae became closely associated with the concept of divine kingship and declined at the same time as this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400 BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900 AD, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (c.900-1521 AD). The major city of [[Calakmul]] in [[Mexico]] raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, numbering at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.<ref name="Drew99p222">Drew 1999, p.222.</ref>

Maya stelae display a wide variety of stylistic variation.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> Many stelae are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or both faces.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> Stelae in a few sites display a much more three dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] and [[Tonin<U+00E1>]].<ref name="Stuart96p149"/>

==Function==
The function of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of [[Maya rulers|Maya kingship]] from the very beginning of the Classic Period (AD 250-900) through to the very end of the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900).<ref>Newsome 1993, 1996, p.1.</ref> The [[Maya script|hieroglyphic inscriptions]] on the stelae of the Classic period site of [[Piedras Negras]] played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories.<ref name="Coe99p224">Coe 1999, p.224.</ref> From these stelae, epigrapher [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.<ref name="Coe99p224"/>

Epigrapher [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as ''te tun'', "stone trees", although he later revised his reading to ''lakamtun'', meaning "banner stone",<ref>Miller 1999, pp.78, 80.</ref> from ''lakam'' meaning "banner" in several [[Mayan languages]] and ''tun'' meaning "stone".<ref name="Stuart96p154">Stuart 1996, p.154.</ref> According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres, as depicted in ancient Maya graffiti.<ref name="Stuart96p154"/> The name of the modern [[Lacandon]] Maya is likely to be a Colonial corruption of this word.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.154.n7.</ref>

Maya stelae were often arranged in order to impress the viewer, forming lines or other arrangements within the ceremonial centre of the city.<ref name="Miller99p80">Miller 1999, p.80.</ref> Maya cities with a history of stonecarving that extended back into the Early Classic preferred to pair their stelae with a circular altar, which may have represented a cut tree trunk and have been used to perform human sacrifice, given the prevalence of sacrificial imagery on such monuments.<ref name="Miller99p80"/> An alternative interpretation of these "altars" is that they were in fact thrones that were used by rulers during ceremonial events.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.171.</ref> Archaeologists believe that they probably also served as ritual pedestals for [[censer|incense burners]], ceremonial fires and other offerings.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/>

The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king.<ref name="Borowicz03p217">Borowicz 2003, p.217.</ref> Many Maya stelae depict only the king of the city and describe his actions with [[Maya script|hieroglyphic script]].<ref name="Miller99p150">Miller 1999, p.150.</ref> Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself, the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king.<ref name="Miller99p150"/> Stelae openly declared the importance and power of the king to the community.<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> The stela displayed the wealth and prestige of the king and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power;<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> it also documented the ancestry of the ruler.<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> Stelae were raised to commemorate important events, especially at the end of a ''[[k'atun]]'' 20-year cycle of the [[Maya Long Count Calendar|Maya calendar]], or to mark a quarter or a half ''k'atun''.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.149.</ref> The stela did not just mark off a period of time, it physically embodied that period of time.<ref name="Stuart96p165">Stuart 1996, p.165.</ref> At Tikal, the [[twin pyramid groups]] were built to celebrate the ''k'atun'' ending and reflected [[Maya religion#Cosmology|Maya cosmology]].<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.731.</ref> These groups possessed [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of the sun.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731"/> On the south side a nine-doored building was situated in order to represent the underworld.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731"/> On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region; it was left open to the sky.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731"/> It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela-altar pair was placed, the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731"/> Calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in the Maya area, that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife.<ref name="Drew99p222"/>

The [[iconography]] of stelae remained reasonably stable during the Classic Period, since the effectiveness of the propaganda message of the monument relied upon its symbolism being clearly recognisable to the viewer.<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> However, at times the iconography did change in response to a shift in the sociopolitical climate.<ref>Borowicz 2003, pp.217-218.</ref> Stelae were an ideal format for public propaganda since, unlike earlier architectural sculpture, they were personalised to a specific king, could be arranged in public spaces and were portable, allowing the stelae to be moved and reset in a new location.<ref name="Borowicz03p218">Borowicz 2003, p.218.</ref> An important feature of stelae was that they were able to survive different phases of architectural construction, unlike architectural sculpture itself.<ref name="Borowicz03p218"/> With the ability to portray an identifiable ruler bearing elite goods, accompanied by hieroglyphic text and carrying out actions in service of the kingdom, stelae became one of the most effective ways of delivering public propaganda in the Maya lowlands.<ref name="Borowicz03p219">Borowicz 2003, p.219.</ref> In 7th century [[Cop<U+00E1>n]], king Chan Imix K'awiil raised a series of seven stelae that marked the boundary of the most fertile land in the Cop<U+00E1>n valley, an area of approximately {{convert|25|to|30|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>Webster 2002, pp.164-165.</ref> As well as marking the boundary, they defined the sacred geometry of the city and referred to important seats of deities in the ceremonial centre of the Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Schele & Looper 2005, p.365.</ref>

===Ritual significance===
{{Maya civilization}}
Stelae were considered to be invested with holiness and to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings.<ref name="Stuart96p157">Stuart 1996, p.157.</ref> Some stelae were given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and were considered to be participants in rituals conducted at their location.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.151.</ref> Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included the ''k'altun'' binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth.<ref name="Stuart96p156">Stuart 1996, p.156.</ref> The ''k'altun'' ritual was closely tied to the ''k'atun''-ending calendrical ceremony.<ref>Stuart 1996, pp.156-158.</ref> A ''k'altun'' ritual is depicted carved onto a [[peccary]] skull deposited as a funerary offering at Cop<U+00E1>n, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela has been bound with cloth.<ref name="Stuart96p156"/> The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the modern day.<ref name="Stuart96p157"/> The precise meaning of the act is not clear but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence.<ref name="Stuart96p157"/> The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.<ref name="Stuart96p157"/>

A stela was not just considered a neutral portrait, it was considered to be owned by the subject, whether that subject was a person or a god.<ref name="Stuart96p158-159">Stuart 1996, pp.158-159.</ref> Stela 3 from El Zapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period, the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god [[Chaac|Yaxhal Chaak]], "Clear Water Chaak".<ref name="Stuart96p158-159"/> The accompanying text describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated, not just his image on the stela.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.159.</ref> This seems to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits, which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented.<ref>Stuart 1996, pp.160, 164.</ref> The stela, combined with any accompanying altar, was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.160.</ref> David Stuart has stated that stelae "do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity".<ref name="Stuart96p165"/> Stelae bearing royal portraits were extensions of the royal "self" and were a powerful confirmation of political and religious authority.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.167.</ref> Stelae bearing images of multiple people, for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his war captives, were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject.<ref name="Stuart96p165"/>

At times, when a new king came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and replaced with new ones, or they might be broken.<ref>Webster 2002, p.154.</ref> When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p300">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.300.</ref> One of the most striking archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p300"/> At the end of the Preclassic, around AD 150, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of [[El Mirador]], where most of the stelae were found smashed.<ref>Drew 1999, p.145.</ref>

==Manufacture==

It is known that royal artisans were sometimes responsible for sculpting stelae; in some cases these sculptors were actually the sons of kings.<ref>Webster 2002, p.158.</ref> In other cases it is likely that captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat.<ref name="Drew99p285">Drew 1999, p.285.</ref> This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela 12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of Pomon<U+00E1>, the defeated city.<ref name="Drew99p285"/> Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]] after its surprise defeat of its overlord Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Drew99p285"/>

Stelae were usually crafted from quarried [[limestone]], although in the [[Southern Maya area]] other types of stone were preferred.<ref name="Miller99p81-82">Miller 1999, pp.81-82.</ref> Volcanic [[tuff]] was used at Cop<U+00E1>n to craft their stelae in three dimensions.<ref name="Miller99p82">Miller 1999, p.82.</ref> Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements.<ref name="Miller99p81-82"/> At Quirigu<U+00E1> a hard red [[sandstone]] was used that was unable to reproduce the three-dimensionality of Cop<U+00E1>n but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free-standing stone monuments in the [[Americas]].<ref name="Miller99p82"/> The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel;<ref>Drew 1999, p.15.</ref> therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the [[Sacbe|Maya causeways]].<ref name="ClarkWernecke05p155">Clark Wernecke 2005, p.155.</ref> Evidence of this has been found on the causeways themselves, where compaction rollers have been recovered.<ref name="ClarkWernecke05p155"/> The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.183.</ref> Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances.<ref name="Miller99p82"/> [[Calakmul]] in [[Mexico]] was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period, the other being Tikal.<ref>Webster 2002, pp.168-169.</ref> It imported black slate for one stela from the [[Maya Mountains]], more than {{convert|320|km|mi}} distant.<ref name="Miller99p82"/> Although Calakmul raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion, making most of them illegible.<ref name="Drew99p222"/>

Maya stelae were worked with stone chisels and probably with wooden mallets.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/> [[Hammerstone]]s were fashioned from [[flint]] and [[basalt]] and were used for rounding of the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/> Originally most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/> At Cop<U+00E1>n and some other Maya cities some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/>

Generally all sides of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming a part of a single composition.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.187.</ref> Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found throughout the Maya region.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated overlaid [[stucco]] sculpture.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.158.</ref>

The Mesoamerican tradition of raising stelae had its origin among the [[Olmecs]] of the Gulf Coast of Mexico.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157">Miller & Taube 2003, p.157.</ref> In the Late Preclassic it then spread into the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and southwards along the Pacific Coast to sites such as [[Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Izapa]] and [[Takalik Abaj]] where [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] dates began to be carved onto the stelae.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157"/> Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157"/> It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157"/> By approximately 400 BC, near the end of the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.182, 197.</ref> At [[El Port<U+00F3>n]] in the [[Salam<U+00E1>]] Valley of [[Guatemalan Highlands|highland Guatemala]] a carved [[schist]] stela (Monument 1) was erected, the badly eroded [[hieroglyph]]s appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p197">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.197.</ref> It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p197"/> Stela 11 at [[Kaminaljuyu]], a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p246">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.246.</ref> The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljyuy and other cities in the region, such as [[Chalchuapa]] in [[El Salvador]] and [[Chocol<U+00E1>]] in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict political succession, [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] and [[Maya warfare|warfare]].<ref name="SharerTraxler06p246"/>

These early stelae depicted rulers as warriors or wearing the masks and headdresses of [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya deities]], accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns, as well as recording their relationships with their ancestors.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.182-183.</ref> Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/> The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.178.</ref> The development of Maya stelae coincides with the development of [[Imperial cult|divine kingship]] among the Classic Maya.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/> In the southern Maya area, the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule, thus reinforcing both his political and religious power.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.274.</ref>

At the Middle Preclassic city of [[Nakbe]] in the central lowlands, Maya sculptors were producing some of the earliest lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals.<ref>Webster 2002, p.189.</ref> Nakbe Stela 1 has been dated to around 400 BC.<ref name="Drew99p129-130">Drew 1999, pp.129-130.</ref> It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]], and would be the earliest known presentation of them.<ref name="Drew99p129-130"/> Around 200 BC the enormous nearby city of [[El Mirador]]  had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable.<ref>Webster 2002, p.188.</ref> A stela has also been discovered at [[El Tintal]], another major Preclassic city in the Mirador Basin.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586">Justeson & Mathews 1983, p.586.</ref>

On the Pacific Coast [[El Ba<U+00FA>l]] Stela 1 features a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to AD 36.<ref>Drew 1999, p.144.</ref> It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear with a double column of hieroglyphic text before him.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p246"/> At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela 2 and Stela 5) depicting the transfer of power from one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing each other with  a column of hieroglyphic text between them.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref> The Long Count date on Stela 2 dates it to the 1st century BC at the latest,<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref> while Stela 5 has two dates, the latest of which is AD 126.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468.</ref> At [[Cuello]] in Belize, a plain stela was raised around AD 100 in an open plaza.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586"/> The stela was associated with the burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586"/>

At the very end of the Preclassic Period, around AD 100-300, cities in the highlands and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.279-280.</ref> This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p280">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.280.</ref> This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango Volcano]] that severely affected the entire region.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p280"/>

In the central [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin|Pet<U+00E9>n]] lowlands, the rise of individual rule at cities like Tikal required the development of new forms of public imagery.<ref name="Borowicz03p218"/> Preclassic imagery had involved largely anonymous, impersonal sculpture as an [[Maya architecture|architectural]] element.<ref name="Borowicz03p218"/> The existing Preclassic Pet<U+00E9>n styles of architectural sculpture were combined with features of the highland and Pacific Coast tradition to produce the Early Classic Maya stela.<ref name="Borowicz03p218"/> Features formerly found on architectural sculpture, such as the giant masks adorning Preclassic pyramids, were adapted for use on stelae.<ref name="Borowicz03p219"/> For example, the so-called "Jester God" was transferred to the headdress of the ruler portrayed on Tikal Stela 29,<ref name="Borowicz03p219"/> which bears the oldest Long Count date yet found in the Maya lowlands - equating to AD 292.<ref>Olmedo Vera 1999, p.24.</ref>  At some Maya cities the first appearance of stelae corresponded with the foundation of [[Dynasty|dynastic rule]].<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/>

The standard form of the Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after AD 250.<ref>Webster 2002, p.119.</ref> The late 4th century AD saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]].<ref>Borowicz 2003, pp.222-224.</ref> This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, [[Uaxactun]], [[R<U+00ED>o Azul]] and [[El Zapote]], all in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department]] of Guatemala.<ref name="Borowicz03p224">Borowicz 2003, p.224.</ref> At Tikal this was initiated by the king [[Yax Nuun Ayiin I]], from there it spread to his vassal cities.<ref name="Borowicz03p224"/> In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by Yax Nuun Ayiin I's son Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands.<ref>Borowicz 2003, p.226.</ref> Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example in the form of Teotihuacan war emblems.<ref>Borowicz 2003, p.227.</ref> His Stela 31 was originally erected in 445 and was found buried in the city centre.<ref>Drew 1999, p.195.</ref> It depicts the crowning of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural and is executed in traditional Maya style.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.195-196.</ref> On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican [[atlatl]] spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc.<ref>Drew 1999, p.196. Martin & Grube 2000, p.35.</ref> The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the [[Tikal#Tikal and Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan invasion]] that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.34.</ref>

In the Early Classic period the Maya kings began to dedicate a new stela, or other monument, to mark the end of each ''k'atun'' cycle (representing 7,200 days, just under 20 [[sidereal year]]s).<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.754.</ref> At Tikal, the first to do so was king Kan Chitam who ruled in the late 5th century AD.<ref name="Borowicz03p230">Borowicz 2003, p.230.</ref> Stela 9 from the city is the first dated monument raised to mark off a period of time, it was raised in 475.<ref name="Borowicz03p230"/>

[[File:Quirigu<U+00E1>Glyphs1.jpg|thumb|right|Hieroglyphic text on the side of Stela E at Quirigu<U+00E1>]]
In the Late Classic the sculpted images of rulers on stelae remained much the same as in the Early Classic, appearing in profile in the foreground and filling almost the entire available space, which is delimited by a frame.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.189.</ref> Imagery associated with the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] started to appear in the Maya lowlands in the Late Classic Period.<ref>Cohodas, 1991, pp.279-280.</ref> Maya kings are depicted as warriors wearing costume from the Mexican highlands, including elements such as the foreign god [[Tlaloc]] and the Teotihacan serpent.<ref name="Cohodas91p280">Cohodas, 1991, p.280.</ref> Such imagery appears in the Late Classic on stelae from [[Naranjo]], [[Piedras Negras]] and the [[Petexbat<U+00FA>n]] cities of [[Dos Pilas]] and [[Aguateca]].<ref name="Cohodas91p280"/> At Dos Pilas, a pair of stelae represent the king of the city in costume forming a [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|jaguar]] and eagle pairing, characteristic of the Mexican warrior cult.<ref name="Cohodas91p280"/> Stelae were being erected by the Maya across the entire central and southern Maya lowlands by 790, an area that encompassed {{convert|150000|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>Webster 2002, p.185.</ref>

In the north, [[Coba]] on the eastern side of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] raised at least 23 large stelae.<ref name="Drew99p362">Drew 1999, p.362.</ref> Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Pet<U+00E9>n Basin.<ref name="Drew99p362"/> At the southern periphery of the Maya region Cop<U+00E1>n developed a new high-[[relief]] style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king Chan Imix K'awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Webster 2002, pp.164-165.</ref> His son and successor [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza the brough the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three dimensional sculpture.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Andrews & Fash 2005, p.424.</ref> Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence in order to justify their rule, possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Andrews & Fash 2005, p.424.</ref>

After Quirigu<U+00E1> defeated its overlord Cop<U+00E1>n in 738, it brought massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the city and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were the biggest monolithic monuments ever raised by the Maya.<ref>Drew 1999, p.241. Webster 2002, p.300.</ref> Stela E stands over {{convert|10|m|ft}} high and weighs more than 60 tons.<ref name="Drew99p241">Drew 1999, p.241.</ref> These stelae were shaped into a square cross-section and were decorated on all four faces.<ref name="Drew99p241"/> These stelae usually bear two images of the Quirigu<U+00E1> king, on the front and the back, in a lower relief than that found at Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Drew99p241"/> They feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among the most skillfully executed of all Maya inscriptions is stone.<ref name="Drew99p242">Drew 1999, p.242.</ref> The stelae have weathered well and display fine precision on the part of the sculptors.<ref name="Drew99p242"/>

===Terminal Classic===

There are panels of hieroglyphs above and to the left of the figure.}}
The decline in the erection of stelae is linked to the decline in the institution of divine kingship, which began in the Late Preclassic.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.500.</ref> Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500"/> By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.500-501.</ref> This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles in order that the king could maintain power but lead to a progressive weakening of the king's rule.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p501">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.501.</ref> As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began to erect their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p501"/> Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p501"/>

In the [[Pasi<U+00F3>n River]] region of Pet<U+00E9>n, rulers began to be portrayed as ballplayers on stelae.<ref name="Cohodas91p279">Cohodas 1991, p.279.</ref> [[Seibal]] was the first site in the region to depict its rulers thus.<ref name="Cohodas91p279"/> Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between AD 849 and 889, they show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of [[Ehecatl]], the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p522Coe99p154">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.522. Coe 1999, p.154.</ref>  Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at [[Cacaxtla]], a non-Maya site in the central [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Tlaxcala]].<ref name="SharerTraxler06p522Coe99p154"/> This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p522Coe99p154"/> Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs.<ref>Coe 1999, p.154.</ref> Stelae at [[Oxkintok]], to the north in the [[Puuc]] region of the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, pp.197-199.</ref> The representation of the human figure differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.198.</ref>

As the [[Classic Maya collapse]] swept across the Maya region, city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500"/> At the important city of [[Calakmul]], two stelae were raised in AD 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.115.</ref> At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.534.</ref> Stela 11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.53.</ref> The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are [[Tonin<U+00E1>]] Monument 101, which was erected in 909 to mark the k'atun ending that year,<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.471, 476, 500.</ref> and Stela 6 from Itzimt<U+00E9>, dated  to 910.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.186.</ref>

===Postclassic===
At Cop<U+00E1>n ritual offerings were deposited around the city's stelae until at least AD 1000, which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or may be due to highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin.<ref>Webster 2002, p.311.</ref> At [[Lamanai]] in [[Belize]], Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century.<ref>Andres & Pyburn 2005, p.410.</ref> At La Milpa, also in Belize, at around the time of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish contact]] in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught.<ref>Drew 1999, p.354.</ref>
