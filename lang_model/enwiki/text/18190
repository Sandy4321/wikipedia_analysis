'''Jacksonville''' is the most populous [[city]] in the state of [[Florida]] and the [[List of United States cities by population|thirteenth most populous]] city in the [[United States]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]].{{GR|6}} Since 1968, the city has shared a [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated]] government with the county, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|largest]] city in land area in the [[continental United States|contiguous United States]]. In 2006, the city proper had an estimated population of 834,789[http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/files/SUB-EST2005-all.csv] with a [[Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan|metropolitan]] population of more than 1.3 million.[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metropop/table01.xls] Jacksonville is the third most populated city on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], after [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. It is the central city of the [[Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan|Jacksonville Metropolitan Statistical Area]], the fourth largest metropolitan area in the state.

Jacksonville is located in the [[First Coast]] region of northeast Florida, about 25 miles south of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border. The city is situated on the banks of the [[St. Johns River]], which flows north and empties into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] about 20 miles east of downtown. The settlement that became Jacksonville was founded in 1791 as '''Cowford''' due to its location at a narrow point in the river across which cattle were once driven. The city was renamed in 1822 for [[Andrew Jackson]], the first [[List of governors of Florida|military governor]] of the [[Florida Territory]] and eventual seventh [[List of Presidents of the United States|President of the United States]]. A bronze sculpture of Jackson atop a steed stands downtown at the corner of Hogan and Water Streets.

==History==
{{main|History of Jacksonville, Florida}}
[[Image:Jax 1893.gif|thumb|left|225px|Bird's-eye view in 1893]]
The history of Jacksonville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area's unique geography and location. The first settlement in the area, called Ossachite, was made over 6,000 years ago by the [[Timucua]] Indians in the vicinity of modern-day downtown Jacksonville.

[[Europe]]an explorers first arrived in 1562, when [[France|French]] [[Huguenot]] explorer [[Jean Ribault]] charted the [[St. Johns River]]. [[Ren<U+00E9> Goulaine de Laudonni<U+00E8>re]] established the first European settlement at [[Fort Caroline]] two years later. On September 20, 1565, an Spanish force attacked Fort Caroline from the nearly Spanish settlement of St. Augustine, and killed all the French soldiers defending it (except Catholics). The Spanish renamed it fort San Mateo. Two years later, Dominique de Gourgues recaptured the settlement from the Spanish and slaughtered all of the Spanish defenders. After the initial destruction of Fort Caroline, St. Augustine became the most important settlement in Florida. Florida was a Spanish possession until it became a territory of the [[United States]] in 1821. The Florida Legislative Council approved a charter for a town government on [[February 9]], [[1832]].

During the [[American Civil War]], Jacksonville was a key supply point for hogs and cattle leaving Florida and aiding the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause. The city was blockaded by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], changing hands several times. Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville, the city was left in a considerable state of disarray after the war.

During [[Reconstruction]] and the [[Gilded Age]], Jacksonville and nearby [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous. Visitors arrived by [[steamboat]] and later by [[railroad]]. The city's tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 1800s by [[yellow fever]] outbreaks and the extension of the Florida East Coast Railroad to south Florida.

On [[May 3]], [[1901]], downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that was started at a fiber factory. Known as the "[[Great Fire of 1901]]", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history, destroying the business district and rendering 10,000 residents homeless in the course of eight hours. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia; smoke plumes in Raleigh, North Carolina. Famed New York architect [[Henry John Klutho]] was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. More than 13,000 buildings were constructed between 1901 and 1912.

[[Image:GaumontStudios.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Motion picture scene at [[Gaumont Studios]], 1910]]
In the 1910s, New York-based moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheap labor. Over the course of the decade, more than 30 silent film studios were established, earning Jacksonville the title "Winter Film Capital of the World". However, the city's conservative political climate and the emergence of [[Hollywood]] as a major film production center ended the city's film industry.  Several converted movie studio sites remain in Arlington.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

During this time, Jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center, with companies such as [[Barnett Bank]], Atlantic National Bank, Florida National Bank, Prudential, Gulf Life, Afro-American Insurance, Independent Life and American Heritage Life thriving in the business district. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] also became a major employer and economic force during the 1940s, with the installation of three major naval bases in the city. Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid [[urban sprawl]] after [[World War II]].

==Geography and climate==
===Geography===
Jacksonville is located at {{coor dms|30|19|10|N|81|39|36|W|city}} (30.319406, -81.659999){{GR|1}}. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 2,264.5 [[km<U+00B2>]] (874.3 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]), making Jacksonville the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States. 1,962.4 km<U+00B2> (757.7 mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and 302.1 km<U+00B2> (116.7 mi<U+00B2>) of it (13.34%) is water. The [[St. Johns River]] runs through the city. The Trout River, a major tributary of the St. Johns River, is located entirely within Jacksonville.

===Climate===
[[Image:Thunderstorm skyline.jpg|thumb|Thunderstorm on the Jacksonville skyline|225px|right|A summer afternoon thunderstorm over the Jacksonville skyline]]
Jacksonville has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with mild weather during winters and hot weather during summers. High temperatures average 64 to 91 <U+00B0>F (18-33 <U+00B0>C) throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/florida/jacksonville/ | title = Climate Information for Jacksonville, Florida | work = ClimateZone.com|accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}</ref>  High [[heat index|heat indices]] are not uncommon for the summer months in the Jacksonville area. High temperatures can reach mid to high 90s with heat index ranges of 105-115&nbsp;<U+00B0>F. The highest temperature ever recorded in Jacksonville was 105 <U+00B0>F (43 <U+00B0>C) on July 21, 1942. It is common for daily thunderstorms to erupt during a standard summer afternoon. These are caused by the heating of the land and water, combined with extremely high humidity.

During winter, the area can experience hard freezes during the night.  Such cold weather is usually short lived. The coldest temperature recorded in Jacksonville was 7 <U+00B0>F (-14 <U+00B0>C) on January 21, 1985, a day that still holds the record cold for many locations in the eastern half of the US.  Even rarer in Jacksonville than freezing temperatures is snow.  When snow does fall, it usually melts before touching the ground, or upon making contact with the ground.  Most denizens of Jacksonville can remember accumulated snow on only one occasion<U+2014>a thin ground cover that occurred a few days before Christmas of 1989.

Jacksonville has suffered less damage from [[hurricane]]s than other east coast cities.  The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871, although Jacksonville ''has'' experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms passing through the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/jacksonville.htm | title = Jacksonville,Florida's history with tropical systems | work = HurricaneCity|accessdate = 2006-07-23 }}</ref>  The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from [[Hurricane Dora]] in [[1964]], the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine, with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph, making it a strong Category 2 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson Scale]].

Rainfall averages around 52 inches a year, with the wettest months being June through September.

===Libraries===
{{main|Jacksonville Public Library (Florida)}}
[[Image:JPLLogo.gif|thumb|right|Jacksonville Public Library.]]
The [[Jacksonville Public Library]] had its beginnings when May Moore and Florence Murphy started the "Jacksonville Library and Literary Association" in 1878. The Association was populated by various prominent Jacksonville residents and sought to create a free public library and reading room for the city.

Over the course of the next 127 years, the system has grown from that one room library to become one of the largest in the state.  Now featuring twenty branches - from the 54,000 sq.ft. West Regional Library (located on Chaffee Road in the western part of the city) to smaller neighborhood libraries like Westbrook and Eastside (located in the central part of the city) - the Library annually receives nearly 4 million visitors and circulates over 6 million items. Nearly 500,000 library cards are held by area residents.

On November 12, 2005, the new 300,000 sq.ft. Main Library opened to the public. The largest public library in the state, this opening was a historic event for the library system and the City of Jacksonville. It marks the completion of an unprecedented period of growth for the system under the [http://www.betterjax.com Better Jacksonville Plan]. 
It adds to the city's architectural and cultural landscape and provides a wonderful gathering place downtown for the entire community.

Jacksonville is home to a number of professional sports teams, the most famous of which is the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] of the [[National Football League]]. The [[Jacksonville Suns]] are a [[minor league baseball]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. There is an [[American Basketball Association (21st century)|ABA]] expansion team, the [[Jacksonville Jam]], that began playing in November of 2006. There is a Women's Football League team, the [[Jacksonville Dixie Blues]]. The [[ice hockey]] team is the [[Jacksonville Barracudas]], which brought the city its only professional hockey championship with the [[WHA2]] President's Cup in [[2004]].  The Jacksonville name is also given to a [[National Indoor Football League]] expansion franchise, which actually plays in nearby [[Green Cove Springs, Florida]]  In 2007 the city is set to host a women's soccer team in the [[Women's Amateur Development Soccer League]]. In [[rugby league]], the [[Jacksonville Axemen]] play in the [[American National Rugby League]]. 

Jacksonville was host city for [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], becoming the third city in the state of Florida ([[Miami, Florida|Miami]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] being the others) to hold the event. Jacksonville's metropolitan area was notably smaller than the previous hosts and lacked adequate hotel space for such an event, so the city chartered several cruise ships to act as "floating hotels" in the St. John's River. The game was held on [[February 6]], [[2005]] and featured halftime entertainment by former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] Sir [[Paul McCartney]].

Jacksonville's history with professional football goes back to the 1960s. In 1967 and 1968 the city hosted the [[American Football League]] (AFL) All Star Game at the Gator Bowl. Jacksonville was the only non-AFL city to host the game. It was presumed at the time that this was a prelude to Jacksonville getting an AFL expansion team, but the AFL merged with the rival [[National Football League]] in 1970 and expansion plans were scrapped. Jacksonville had its first professional football teams with the [[Jacksonville Sharks]] (1974) and [[Jacksonville Express]] (1975) of the [[World Football League]] (WFL), which folded in 1975. The first regular-season professional football game held in Jacksonville took place on July 11, 1974 as the Sharks defeated the New York Stars 14-7 in front of just over 59,000 fans at the Gator Bowl. The Sharks' Alvin Wyatt scored the first touchdown in Jacksonville pro football history on a punt return. In 1984 football returned for two seasons with the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL). The 1984 Bulls were an expansion team but were only one year behind the rest of the league. The USFL ceased operations after the 1985 season.

Several NFL teams flirted with moving to the city over the years. The [[Baltimore Colts]] and [[Houston Oilers]] were said to have been the most serious, while several other teams used the threat of relocation to Jacksonville as leverage in getting new stadiums in their own cities. The awarding of an NFL franchise to the city in 1995, which most pundits said was highly unlikely, was said to have been in part a reward for the city having been a "friend" to several NFL owners. Jacksonville native and then-Tampa Bay Buccaneers' owner Hugh Culverhouse is also said to have played a role in Jacksonville landing the Jaguars franchise.

The [[Gator Bowl]] college football bowl game has been played in the city since 1946.

The Jacksonville area also boasts many highly rated golf courses. In [[Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida|Ponte Vedra]] lies the [[Sawgrass|Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass]], one of the most famous golf courses in the world and home to the annual [[PGA tour]], TPC ([[THE PLAYERS Championship]]) tournament (considered by the Media as Golf's unofficial 5th Major. [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] is home to the [[World Golf Village]] and [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]. The [[PGA tour]] also has it's headquarters located in [[Ponte Vedra Beach]].

Professional tennis is in town each year when the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] holds the [[Bausch & Lomb]] Championships at [[Amelia Island]] Plantation near [[Fernandina Beach, Florida|Fernandina Beach]], just north of Jacksonville. Other sports events include the annual Kingfish Tournament held in July, the [[University of Florida|Florida]]-[[University of Georgia|Georgia]] football game, commonly known as "[[The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party]]" held every October, the [[ACC Championship]] football and baseball, and the [[Gator Bowl]] held in early January. The [[University of North Florida]], [[Jacksonville University]] and [[Edward Waters College]] also field athletic teams in a number of sports. On March 2006, Jacksonville held the first round of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] 68th Annual Division I Basketball Championship with [[Jacksonville University]] as host.

===Film and television===
In the early 1900s, [[New York]]-based moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of "The Winter Film Capital of the World". Over 30 movie studios were opened and thousands of silent films produced between 1908 and the 1920s, when most studios relocated to [[Hollywood, California]].

Since that time, Jacksonville has been chosen by a number of film and television studios for on-location shooting. Notable motion pictures that have been partially or completely shot in Jacksonville since the silent film era include ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954), ''[[The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking]]'' (1988), ''[[Brenda Starr (comic strip)|Brenda Starr]]'' (1989), ''[[G.I. Jane]]'' (1997), ''[[The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997), ''Ride'' (1998), ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall In Love]]'' (1998), ''[[Forces of Nature]]'' (1999), ''[[Tigerland]]'' (2000), ''[[Sunshine State (film)|Sunshine State]]'' (2002), ''[[Basic (film)|Basic]]'' (2003), ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (2004), ''[[Lonely Hearts]]'' (2006), ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' (2006), ''[[Moving McAllister]]'' (2007), ''[[Rocket]]'' (2007), ''[[Throwing Stars]]'' (2007).

Notable television series or made-for-television films that have been partially or completely shot in Jacksonville include ''Intimate Strangers'' (1986), ''[[Inherit the Wind]]'' (1988), ''Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer'' (1989), ''A Girl of the Limberlost'' (1990), ''[[Orpheus Descending]]'' (1990), ''Pointman'' (1995), ''[[Saved by the Light]]'' (1995), ''The Babysitter's Seduction'' (1996), ''Sudden Terror: The Hijacking of School Bus #17'' (1996), ''First Time Felon'' (1997), ''[[Gold Coast (film)|Gold Coast]]'' (1997), ''[[Safe Harbor]]'' (1999), ''[[The Conquest of America]]'' (2005), and ''[[Super Bowl XXXIX]]'' (2005).

Oliver Hardy, of the famous movie comedy team of Laurel & Hardy, made his first movies in Jacksonville in the 1910s.[http://www.oliverhardy.com/]

==Economy==
Jacksonville's location on the [[St. Johns River]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] proved providential in the growth of the city and its industry. The largest city in the state, it is also the largest deepwater port in the south and a leading port in the U.S. for [[automobile]] imports, as well as the leading [[transportation]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] hub in the state. However, the strength of the city's economy lies in its broad diversification. The area's economy is balanced among [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[financial services]], [[biomedical technology]], [[consumer goods]], [[information]] services, [[manufacturing]], and other industries.

Jacksonville is a [[Rail transport|rail]], [[air]], and [[highway]] focal point and a busy port of entry, with [[Jacksonville International Airport]], ship repair [[shipyard|yards]] and extensive freight-handling facilities. [[Lumber]], [[phosphate]], [[paper]], [[cigars]] and [[wood pulp]] are the principal exports; [[automobiles]] and [[coffee]] are among imports. The city also has a large and diverse [[manufacturing]] base. According to Forbes.com Jacksonville, Florida ranked in the top ten U.S. cities to relocate to find a job.

Jacksonville is home of several corporations and organizations:
*Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida [http://bcbsfl.com]

==Neighborhoods==
{{main|Neighborhoods of Jacksonville, Florida}}
As the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States, Jacksonville is informally divided into four major sections; '''Downtown''', which forms the urban core of the city, lying on the north bank of the narrowest part of the St. Johns River,  '''Southside''', which refers to everything between the St. Johns River and the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]; '''Northside''', which is generally considered to be everything north of the St. Johns and east of New Kings Road; and '''Westside''', which consists of everything west of the St. Johns River and south of New Kings Rd.  (There is also a distinct part of the city known as "Eastside" which is actually part of Downtown.)  Additionally, with the rapid growth in the eastern parts of Duval County, the Intracoastal/Beaches area has emerged as a major section as well, but is not generally included in a Jacksonville list, since the Beaches communities lie outside of the Jacksonville city limits. Each of these sections is divided into many neighborhoods.

==Infrastructure==
===Government===
====History====
After [[World War II]], the government of the City of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor [[W. Haydon Burns]]' ''Jacksonville Story'' resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of [[suburb]]s and a subsequent wave of "[[white flight]]" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before. Much of the city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits. In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement. In [[1958]], a study recommended that the City of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county. Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.

In the mid [[1960s]], corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional [[good ol' boy network]]. After a [[grand jury]] was convened to investigate, several officials were indicted and more were forced to resign. Consolidation, led by Sheriff Dale Carson, began to win more support during this period, from both inner city blacks (who wanted more involvement in government) and whites in the suburbs (who wanted more services and more control over the central city). The simultaneous disaccredation of all fifteen of Duval County's public high schools in 1964 added momentum to the proposals for government reform. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.

A consolidation referendum was held in [[1967]], and voters approved the plan. On [[October 1]], [[1968]], the governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville.

[[Image:stjames.jpg|thumb|right|The St. James Building, the seat of city government in Jacksonville.]]
====Structure====
The most noteworthy feature of Jacksonville government is its consolidated nature. The Duval County-Jacksonville consolidation eliminated any type of separate county [[executive (government)|executive]] or [[legislature]], and supplanted these positions with the Mayor of Jacksonville and the City Council of the City of Jacksonville, respectively. Because of this, voters who live ''outside'' of the city limits of Jacksonville, but ''inside'' of Duval County, are allowed not only to vote in elections for these positions, but to run for them as well. In fact, in [[1995]], [[John Delaney]], a resident of [[Neptune Beach]], was elected mayor of the City of Jacksonville. 

Jacksonville uses the [[Mayor-council government|Mayor-Council]] form of city government, also called the Strong-Mayor form, in which a mayor serves as the city's Chief Executive and Administrative officer. The mayor holds veto power over all resolutions and ordinances made by the city council, and also has the power to hire and fire the head of various city departments.

The city council has nineteen members, fourteen of whom are elected from single-member districts, and five who are ostensibly elected at-large. However, although these five additional council members are ''elected'' at-large, they are required to meet an unusual residency requirement. In the early 1990s, because these five "at-large" members were generally all elected from the same area, voters approved a change in the city government which divided the city up into five districts unrelated to any other districts, solely for the purpose of electing these at-large council members. Thus, at-large council members are elected ''from'' each of these five districts ''by'' the voters of the county as a whole.

Some government services remained&mdash;as they had been prior to consolidation <U+2013> independent of both city and county authority. In accordance with Florida law, the school board continues to exist with nearly complete autonomy. Jacksonville also has several quasi-independent government agencies which only nominally answer to the consolidated authority, including, electric authority, port authority, and airport authority. Fire, police, health and welfare, recreation, public works, and housing and urban development were all combined under the new government.

Four municipalities within Duval County voted not to join the consolidated government. These were the communities of Baldwin, Neptune Beach, Atlantic Beach and Jacksonville Beach, which consist of only 6% of the total population within the county. The four separate communities provide their own services, while maintaining the right to contract the consolidated government to provide services for them. For example, in December of 2005, the city council of Baldwin voted to eliminate the Baldwin Police Department, a decision which was consummated in March of 2006.  Since that time, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has assumed policing responsibilities for the one-square mile town, located in the far western portion of Duval County.

===Education===
Jacksonville, along with the standard district schools, is home to two [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme]] ("IB") high schools. They are [[Stanton College Preparatory School]] and [[Paxon School for Advanced Studies]].Jacksonville also has a notable magnet high school devoted to the performing and expressive arts, [[Douglas Anderson School of the Arts]].
''See also: ''[[List of high schools in Florida#Duval County|List of high schools in Jacksonville]]

Jacksonville is home to [[Jacksonville University]], the [[University of North Florida]], [[Florida Community College at Jacksonville]], [[Edward Waters College]], [[Art Institute of Jacksonville]], [[Florida Coastal School of Law]], [[Trinity Baptist College]], [[Jones College (Jacksonville)|Jones College]], [[Florida Technical College]], [[Logos Christian College]], and [[Brewer Christian College]].

Former mayor [[John Delaney]] has been president of the University of North Florida since leaving office in [[July 2003]], parlaying his widespread popularity in the city into a position of leadership in the [[State University System of Florida|state university system]].

Jacksonville is also home to two Catholic high schools: Bishop Kenny and Bishop John J. Snyder. Bishop John J. Snyder is the newer high school, named after Bishop John J. Snyder.

===Transportation===
[[Image:P-3C Orion over Jacksonville Florida.jpg|300px|thumb|[[P-3 Orion]] aircraft from [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville|NAS Jacksonville]] overfly downtown Jacksonville and three of its road bridges, 1994.]]
[[Image:Jacksonville downtown bridges.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1992 map of four of the bridges.]]
Interstate Highways [[Interstate 10|10]] and [[Interstate 95|95]] intersect in Jacksonville. Interstate Highway [[Interstate 10|10]] ends at this intersection (the other end being in [[Santa Monica, California]]). The eastern terminus of [[U.S. Highway 90|US-90]] is in nearby [[Jacksonville Beach, Florida|Jacksonville Beach]] near the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Additionally, several other roads as well a major local expressway, [[J. Turner Butler Boulevard]] (SR 202) also connect Jacksonville to the beaches. Public transportation is provided by the [[Jacksonville Transportation Authority]]. The city has the [[Jacksonville Skyway]], an elevated [[monorail]], which travels through the central business district. However, there are few Skyway stations and as such, traffic is light. The Skyway has been criticized in that it goes from "nowhere to nowhere" along its limited route, which encompasses only downtown and is of no help in commuting from suburban neighborhoods. Interstate 95 has a [[bypass route]], with [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|I-295]], which bypasses the city to the west, and [[Florida State Road 9A|SR-9A]], bypassing the city to the east. I-295 and SR-9A circumscribe the most populated portion of Jacksonville.

Jacksonville is also home to the world headquarters of [[CSX Transportation]], which owns a large building on the riverbank downtown that is a significant part of the skyline. The [[Amtrak]] passenger railroad serves Jacksonville from [[Jacksonville (Amtrak station)|a station on Clifford Lane]] in the northwest section of the city.

There are also numerous bridges over the [[St. Johns River]] at Jacksonville. They include (starting from furthest downstream) the [[Dames Point Bridge]], the [[Mathews Bridge]], the [[Hart Bridge|Isaiah D. Hart Bridge]], the [[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]], the [[Acosta Bridge]], the [[Fuller Warren Bridge]] (which carries [[Interstate 95|I-95]] traffic) and the [[Buckman Bridge]].

Major commercial air service in Jacksonville operates out of [[Jacksonville International Airport]]. Smaller planes can fly to [[Craig Airport]] on the Southside and [[Herlong Airport]] on the Westside. The city also operates an airfield at Cecil Commerce Center that is intended for aerospace manufacturing companies.

Four modern seaport facilities, including America's newest cruise port, make Jacksonville a full-service international seaport. In 2004, [[JAXPORT]] handled 7.7 million tons of cargo, including 533,000 vehicles. In [[2003]], the [[JAXPORT Cruise Terminal]] opened, providing cruise service to [[Key West, Florida]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[Mexico]].
