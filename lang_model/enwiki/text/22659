'''Continental Divide Air Force Station (ADC ID: P-7)''' is a closed [[United States Air Force]] General Surveillance Radar station.  It is located {{convert|7.4|mi|km}} west of [[Thoreau, New Mexico]].  It was closed in 1961.

==History==
In late 1951 [[Air Defense Command]] selected this mountainous site near Thoreau, New Mexico as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the [[Korean War]], on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary<U+2019>s approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction.

On 1 January 1951 the [[769th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron]] was activated at the site, designated as Gonzales Air Force Station. The initial assignment of personnel was four officers and forty-three airmen.  The radars consisted of [[AN/FPS-3]] and [[AN/FPS-5]] sets. On 1 December 1953, the site was renamed Continental Divide Air Force Station.

Facilities on the station consisted of a multi-purpose building containing a Barbershop, a Day Room/Library, a Gymnasium with a single basketball backboard which doubled as an auditorium for Commander's Call, training lectures, and movies.  An outdoor tennis court and also an Airman's barracks was constructed, along with a 16 place trailer park was also available.

In 1955 an [[AN/FPS-4]] height-finder radar was installed, only to be replaced a year later by an [[AN/FPS-6]] model. At the end of 1960, this radar was transferred to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] pending deactivation of the 769th on 1 July 1961 due to budget reductions.  

After the station was closed, the site was turned over to the General Services Administration for disposal.   The United States Forest Service used the facilities until 1974 when it was provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for their use.   In December 1985 the site was closed and the five buildings remaining on the site were torn down, the site restored to a natural state.

Today, what once was Continental Divide AFS has been razed.  The streets of the station remain, and a few buildings are in very decrepit condition.  It has largely returned to the elements.
