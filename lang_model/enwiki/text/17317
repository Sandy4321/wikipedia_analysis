'''Raffaele Conflenti''' (4 December 1889 <U+2013> 16 July 1946)<ref name=cantieri>{{cite web|url=http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/sez_tematiche_it.php?menu_id=969246 |title=Le Officine Aeronautiche <U+2013> Gli uomini <U+2013> Raffaele Conflenti |website=[http://www.archeologiaindustriale.it/index_it.php Museo della Cantieristica] |accessdate=9 January 2015 |author=Sergio Mecchia |language=it}}</ref> was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineer]] and aircraft designer. During his career, he worked for some of the most important [[seaplane]] manufacturers in Italy and designed a large number of aircraft including civil and military [[flying boats]], record-breaking seaplanes and land [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainers]] and [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]].

==Biography==
Conflenti was born in [[Cosenza]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], on 4 December 1889. He graduated in engineering and in 1912 he started working for Societ<U+00E0> Italiana Transaerea (Italian Trans-Aeronautical Company, or SIT) in [[Turin]]. He then worked for [[Domenico Santoni]]'s Societ<U+00E0> Costruzioni Aeronautiche Savoia (Savoia Aeronautical Works Company) in [[Milan]] and later he became the technical director of [[Societ<U+00E0> Idrovolanti Alta Italia|SIAI]] (Societ<U+00E0> Idrovolanti Alta Italia, [[Italian language|Italian]] for Seaplane Company of Northern Italy), the company Santoni had founded in 1914 together with businessman Luigi Cap<U+00E8>. SIAI was headquartered in [[Sesto Calende]], on [[Lake Maggiore]].<ref name=cantieri/>

Conflenti, who had initially supervised the production of license-built [[Bl<U+00E9>riot A<U+00E9>ronautique|Bl<U+00E9>riot]], [[Maurice Farman]] and [[Henri Farman]] aircraft, now turned to [[Franco-British Aviation|FBA]] types. In 1917, however, his first original design<U+2014>the [[SIAI S.8]]<U+2014>made its maiden flight. Conflenti designed several other aircraft for SIAI before Santoni suddenly left SIAI and moved to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]], in the suburbs of [[Paris]], where in 1921 he founded a new company named [[Chantiers A<U+00E9>ro-Maritimes de la Seine|CAMS]] (Chantiers A<U+00E9>ro-Maritimes de la Seine, [[French language|french]] for Aircraft and Shipping Yards of the [[Seine]]); Conflenti followed Santoni a few months later and became the technical director of CAMS. CAMS initially built SIAI aircraft under license, but Conflenti soon started designing new types of seaplanes, including record-breaking [[CAMS 30E|CAMS 30T]] and [[CAMS 36]].<ref name=cantieri/>

Conflenti left CAMS in 1923 and he went back to Italy, where he became the head designer of the newly founded aeronautical section of [[Cantiere Navale Triestino|CNT]] (Cantiere Navale Triestino, italian for Shipyard of [[Trieste]]), headquartered in [[Monfalcone]]. He held that position until 1932<ref name=cantieri/> (in the meantime, CNT had merged with [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] giving birth to [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]], or CRDA).

Between late 1932 and 1935 Conflenti worked for the [[Societ<U+00E0> Aerea Mediterranea]] (SAM) airline. In 1936 he started working for the [[Caproni]] group, where he collaborated with [[Giovanni Pegna]]; among his last designs were the [[Caproni Ca.164]], [[Caproni Ca.165|Ca.165]] and [[Caproni Ca.603|Ca.603]].<ref name=cantieri/>

Conflenti died in Cosenza on 16 July 1946.<ref name=cantieri/>
