The '''2009 Pacific typhoon season'''  has no official bounds; it runs year-round in 2009, but most [[tropical cyclone]]s tend to form in the northwestern [[Pacific Ocean]] between May and November.<ref name="Padgett May 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/garyp_mgtcs/may03sum.txt|author=Gary Padgett|date=August 17, 2003|publisher=Typhoon 2000|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary May 2003|accessdate=October 30, 2008}}</ref> These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the [[International Date Line]]. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see [[2009 Pacific hurricane season]]. Tropical storms formed in the entire Western North Pacific basin are assigned a name by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]. Tropical depressions formed in this basin are given a number with a "W" suffix by the United States' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]. In addition, the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility. These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines.

On January 4, Dr. Prisco Nilo, the director of PAGASA, reported that PAGASA were expecting 19 tropical cyclones or less during the typhoon season.<ref name="PAGJAN"/> PAGASA then reported on June 15, that the bulk of the activity would be coming up during the next three months with seven to ten tropical cyclones predicted to move through their area of responsibility.<ref name="PAGJUN"/> During May 2009, the Vietnamise National Centre for Hydro Meteorological forecasts predicted that the number of tropical cyclones causing damage to Vietnam during the season would be more than the average of six cyclones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kYKu01hA|title=Rainy season outlook for 2009 (from May to October)|date=2009-05-01|publisher=Vietnamise National Centre for Hydro Meteorological forecasts|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref> On June 30 as Taiwan, entered their typhoon season, the [[Central Weather Bureau]] predicted that 24 to 27 tropical storms would form over the Western Pacific, with 3 or 5 tropical storms affecting Taiwan.<ref name="CWB"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/07/01/2003447575|title=CWB expects three to five typhoons to hit this year|date=2009-07-01|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref>

Since the [[2000 Pacific typhoon season|2000 season]], the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the [[City University of Hong Kong]] has forecast the expected number of tropical cyclones, named storms, and [[typhoons]] in a season with forecasts released in April and June. This season, the CityUHK is predicting an about average season. An average season, according to the CityUHK, has 31 tropical cyclones, 27 named storms, and 17 typhoons. In its April forecast, the CityUHK predicted 31 total tropical cyclones, 27 named storms, and 18 typhoons. It also forecast that 4 tropical cyclones would make landfall in [[Southern China]], all of which are expected to be in the early season (between May and August). A normal season sees 5 such landfalls, of which 3 are early and two are late (September to December).<ref name="CUHK April"/> In its June forecast, the CityUHK lowered its prediction of how many tropical depressions would form this season to 30 whilst leaving their predictions of how many tropical depressions would intensify further the same as their April forecast.<ref name="CUHK June"/> They also reported that due to a developing elnino event that only three systems were expected to make landfall on China between July and December.<ref name="CUHK June"/>

Early on April 26, an area of disturbed weather formed near the coastline of Baler, capital of the Philippine's Aurora provence. It was formerly a tail end of cold front that passed by Northern [[Luzon]]. [[Joint Typhoon Warning Centre|JTWC]] assesed that the area of a disturbed weather potential of becoming developing into a significant Tropical Cyclone within 24 hours as "fair". However, on April 28, JTWC downgraded the disturbance as dissipating because of interaction with nearby middle Tropical Depression Crising and JMA Tropical Depression 03. A few days later, the disturbance moved south-westward, and late on April 30, the disturbance made landfall at [[Albay]]. On May 1, JTWC again upgraded the disturbance into having a potential to form into a significant Tropical Cyclone within 24 hours to "fair". And later that day, [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]] classified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming it "Dante" and issued [[Hurricane_warning#Philippines|public storm warning signal number one]] in the provinces of [[Camarines Norte]], [[Camarines Sur]], [[Albay]], [[Sorsogon]], [[Catanduanes]], [[Masbate]], [[Burias Island]], and Southern Quezon.<ref name="Dante1">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5gRoGUMp4|title=PAGASA Tropical Depression Dante Advisory 1|date=May 1, 2009|publisher=PAGASA|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> PAGASA also reported that Dante made landfall in the vicinity of [[Sorsogon]] within the Bicol region of the Philippines. Early on May 2, JTWC issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|TCFA]] as the depression was in an almost stationary position. Later that day, JMA classified Dante as a full depression. Early the next morning it became a tropical storm and was named Kujira. Kujira continued to strengthen and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm that afternoon.
When it was over the Philippines it killed 27 people while 9 others are missing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090504-202925/Storm-Dante-kills-13-in-Bicol-9-missing|title=Storm <U+2018>Dante<U+2019> kills 13 in Bicol; 9 missing |date=May 4, 2009|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> The JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon early on May 4. Kujira intensified quickly, doubling in strength from a Category 2 typhoon to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon within 24 hours. On May 6, The JTWC reported that Kujira was in its beginning stages of becoming extratropical, with the low level circulation center almost fully exposed in association with increasing vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures in the region. Late that, JMA downgraded Kujira to a Severe Tropical Storm as strong wind shear weakens the system. Then early on May 7, JTWC issued its last advisory on Kujira, already reporting it as an extratropical system. JMA continued to issue warnings on the system while at the same time it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later on May 7, Kujira weakened further, becoming a fully extratropical cyclone.

While in the Philippine area of responsibility, Kujira caused some 625,709,464 worth of damage to crops and livestock in Albay, Camarines Norte, Masbate and Sorsogon.  It also caused some 102 million pesos worth of damage to communal irrigation systems in the region.<ref name="damages">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/05/06/09/typhoon-dantes-death-toll-rise-27|title=Typhoon Dante's death toll rises to 27|date=May 12, 2009|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> The NDCC update as of 6AM PST May 12 declared 28 dead, one missing and 5 injured.

On May 1, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with an area of disturbed weather formed southeast of Nha Trang, Vietnam and associated with a remnant of Tropical depression Crising to form a new stronger area of disturbed weather system. JTWC monitored the disturbance as "Fair" for developing due to low vertical wind shear and an upper level anticyclone to the east of the system. Later on the JMA designated the low pressure as a minor tropical depression reporting the outlook track as southwestward. The JTWC issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|TCFA]] on the system once the convection increased and became better organized although with an exposed LLC east of its convection. Early morning of May 3, the JMA begun issuing tropical cyclone advisories on the system forecasting it to become a tropical storm later in the afternoon as it tracked eastwards. On May 3, the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 02W, and the JMA named the storm Chan-hom. Later on May 4, Chan-hom strengthened into a severe tropical storm. On May 6, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility from the west and was named as Emong. Later that day the JMA upgraded the severe tropical storm to a typhoon. On May 7, PAGASA reported that Chan-hom had made landfall at the northern tip of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan]]. After traversing Pangasinan it lashed [[La Union]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Benguet]], [[Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Ifugao Province|Ifugao]], [[Mt. Province]], [[Kalinga Province|Kalinga]] and [[Isabela Province|Isabela]]. Pangasinan (which recorded 150mm of rain from Emong) and La Union were the worst hit. The provinces in [[Central Luzon]], [[Ilocos]], [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] and [[Cagayan Valley]], together with [[Metro Manila]] and parts of Southern Luzon, generally experienced more than 100&nbsp;mm in the 24 hour period on May 7. Rains, however, lasted from May 6-8. NDCC updates on 6:00AM on May 13 put dead at 50, injured at 47 and missing at 13 and damage worth 690 million pesos in agriculture, infrastructure and private property. It further left 204,000 persons affected, damaged 23280 houses of which 6080 are totally damaged and 17200 partially damaged in Pangasinan and induced 11 landslide occurrences in Zambales and Cagayan <ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090508-203768/Emong-lashes-Pangasinan-fells-power-lines|title=<U+2018>Emong<U+2019> lashes Pangasinan; fells power lines |date=May 8, 2009|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> PAGASA expected the typhoon to weaken quickly, which it did.<ref name="Emong5">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5gb08UD3f|title=PAGASA  Advisory 5 for Typhoon Emong (Chan-hom) on May 7, 2009.|publisher=PAGASA|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> On May 8, Chan-hom was downgraded to a Tropical Storm and later, to a Tropical Depression. JMA issued its last warning early on May 9, followed by the JTWC. PAGASA held on to Emong (Chan-hom) until much later that day, when it was declared an area of low pressure. JTWC then re-issued advisories on the restrengthening depression on May 10. Later on May 11, Chan-hom became a subtropical depression{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, therefore, JMA and PAGASA designated it a tropical depression while JTWC declared it dissipated{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} , PAGASA reported Tropical Depression Chan-hom degenerated into Subtropical Disturbance ex-Chan-hom{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and issued the final advisory for the system because it had almost completely dissipated. However, JMA did not issue the final advisory for the tropical depression until early on May 13, when then circulation dissipated and it began accelerate northeastward in association of the jet stream and it was forecast to become extratropical or be absorbed by a cold front.

This was because convection had begun to organize and upper-level analysis showed a cyclonic center on the east, just west of [[Guam]] and a cyclonic flow around its consolidating low level circulation Centre. After 4 hours, JTWC issued its first warning and named it as Tropical Depression 04W. Early on June 23, [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]] issued its first warning on the Tropical Depression and assigned its local named "Feria". In the afternoon, Nangka made its first landfall over [[Hernani, Eastern Samar]] at 5:00 pm PST (0900 UTC). and made its second landfall in Masbate around 10:00PM PST ( 1400 UTC). On June 24, Nangka rapidly slowed down while moving over Mindoro. The storm then made its third landfall at Calapan City, Mindoro at 12 am PST/ 0430 UTC. After crossing Mindoro for 8 hours, PAGASA downgraded Nangka into a Tropical Depression, while both the JMA and JTWC still classified Nangka as a tropical storm on that day. Early on June 25, Nangka move into the South China Sea, with PAGASA issuing their final warning. In the evening of that same day, both JMA and JTWC downgraded Nangka into a tropical depression due to its low level circulation center is started to deteriorate. By midday of June 26, it made its forth landfall in the [[Guangzhou]] province in China, passing through the northern part of [[Hong Kong]]. In the afternoon of that day, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning on Nangka. Its remnants completely dissipated by June 27.

On July 10, the JTWC reported that an area of disturbed weather had persisted about 1065&nbsp;km (660&nbsp;mi) to the east of Manila. The convection was consolidating with a good mid level circulation and was located under a anticyclone and had started to show some outflow into a trough to the northeast of the system. Early the next day the JMA reported that the disturbance had become a minor tropical depression. The depression then gradually developed during the rest of July 11, with PAGASA naming the depression as Huaning early on July 12 whilst the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression. Early the next day PAGASA upgraded Huaning into tropical storm whilst the JTWC designated the depression as Tropical Depression 06W. Later that morning Huaning made its first landfall over [[Chungyang]], [[Taiwan]]. On the next day, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning on Huaning.

Late on July 10, an area of disturbed weather persisted about 280&nbsp;km (175&nbsp;miles), to the southeast of [[Yap]]. Convection was wrapping into a poorly organized and drawn out low level circulation center and was under minimal wind shear. It gradually developed further throughout the next day with convection continuing to consolidate over a low level circulation center. However early on July 12, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had dissipated, as outflow was being hampered by the outflow of Huaning. However late on July 13, the JTWC reported that the disturbance had rapidly redeveloped and released a TCFA on the disturbance. Early the next day both PAGASA and the JMA designated the disturbance as a Tropical Depression with PAGASA assigning the local name of Isang to the depression. The Depression continued to develop and was designated as Tropical Depression 07W by the JTWC early on July 15, whilst PAGASA upgraded Isang to a Tropical storm later that day. On July 17, JMA upgraded Molave as a Severe Tropical Storm and Typhoon by PAGASA. On morning of July 18, [[Hong Kong Observatory|HKO]] upgraded Molave as a Typhoon. Later that day, Molave quickly moved into the [[South China Sea]]. On July 19, at 1700 UTC or 1am HKT, Molave made its first landfall. On the afternoon, as Molave move through China, both JMA and JTWC issued their final warning as Molave weakened into a Tropical depression. Molave killed at least four people.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|publisher=''The Filipino Star''|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=July 17, 2009|title='Isang' leaves 1 dead, 2 missing|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5j4oAXlZt|date=2009-08-16}}</ref>{{clear}}

Late on July 25, the JTWC reported that an area of convection had formed in a monsoon trough about 815&nbsp;km (515&nbsp;mi) to the northeast of [[Guam]].<ref name="STWA25070922z">{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2009072522-ABPW.PGTW|title=Significant tropical weather advisory for the Western and the Southern Pacific Oceans|date=2009-07-25|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> Deep convection was flaring around the low level circulation center.<ref name="STWA25070922z"/> An upper level anticyclone and a tropical upper tropospheric trough was providing outflow.<ref name="STWA25070922z"/> Over the next few days the disturbance gradually developed before the disturbance was declared as dissipated early on July 28 as the low level circulation center was not well defined and higher vertical wind shear affecting the system. However the disturbance regenerated early on July 30 whilst located about 630&nbsp;km (390&nbsp;mi), the disturbance's low level circualtion center was elongated with indications of multiple circulation centers. Later that day PAGASA reported that the disturbance had developed into a tropical depression and assigned its local name of Jolina. Jolina then intensifed further early the next day and was reported to have become a tropical storm by PAGASA, with the JMA designating it as a depression later that day. Early on August 1 the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection had increased and was starting to consolidate around a circulation center. However later that morning Jolina made a landfall near to Casiguran, in the Philippine province of Aurora before emerging out in to the South China sea later that day. Early the next day the JTWC reissued their TCFA whilst PAGASA issued their final warning on Jolina as it moved out of their area of responsibility heading towards a landfall on China. The JTWC then designated the depression as 08W later that day as infrared imagery had shown deep convection was wrapping into the low level circulation center. During August 3, the JMA reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned the Goni to the cyclone. At 1700 UTC of August 4, Goni made its second landfall over Macau. Early on the next day, JTWC issued their final warning on Goni. On August 7, The Joint Typhoon Warning noted that remnant of Goni re-entered into the Gulf of Tonkin and had a poor chance of regenerating. Later in the day, Joint Typhoon Warning Center reissued advisories on the system upgrading it to a tropical storm near Hainan Island.

In the Philippines Goni (Jolina) death toll is 8 with 5 more missing. Goni (Jolina)  affected 38,589 families or 160,038 people in 119 villages in 25 towns and five cities in [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Batangas]], [[Cagayan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Rizal]], [[Mindoro Occidental]], [[Palawan]], [[Iloilo]], [[Negros Occidental]], [[Lanao del Sur]], and [[Sultan Kudarat]] town in [[Maguindanao]].<ref>http://ph.news.yahoo.com/gma/20090804/tph-jolina-death-toll-rises-to-8-5-still-ce44f36.html</ref>

On August 6, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with monsoon through was located about (620&nbsp;miles) 1000&nbsp;km southwest of [[Iwo To]], Japan. Satellite imagery shows an TUTT was located to the northeast of the system. and the system is also located under high vertical wind shear and favorable environment. Late of August 7, JTWC upgraded the system and issued a TCFA because of LLCC is partially exposed. while JMA also upgraded the system as a minor tropical depression. On the next day, both JMA and JTWC classifies the minor tropical depression as a full depression. On August 8, JMA upgraded the system as a tropical storm and assigned the name Etau.

In post-storm analysis, the JMA downgraded Etau to a tropical storm, with peak winds of 75&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph).<ref>http://www.webcitation.org/5kELGYqwT</ref>

On August 13, the remnants of [[2009 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Maka|Tropical Storm Maka]] crossed the international dateline and moved into the Western Pacific; where it was immediately designated as a tropical depression by the JMA. Later that day the JTWC reported that the depression was located about 1425&nbsp;km (885&nbsp;miles) to the southeast of Wake Island, with deep convection developing over the northern quadrant of a stretched out, low level circulation center which was in an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow into an upper level trough.

On August 14, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with a monsoon formed about (400&nbsp;miles) 750&nbsp;km to the northeast of [[Pohnpei]]. Satellite imagery began showing that convective bands were starting to wrap into the Low Level Circulation Center (LLCC) from the northeast to southwest and the system was also under an area of low shear with some poleward outflow into a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) that was located to the northeast. The next day, the system was showing more good outflow and its LLCC was now fully exposed, whilst the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical depression in the afternoon of August 16. Early of the next day, JTWC issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert|TCFA]] as the system developed rapidly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5j1gF8BDx|title=Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert 16-08-2009 12z|date=2009-08-16|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref> On August 17, the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Vamco while JTWC classified it as tropical depression 11W. On the next day, JTWC finally upgraded TD 11W into a tropical storm. Several hours later, the JMA reported that Vamco had strengthened into a severe tropical storm. Early of August 19, the JMA reported that Vamco had intensified to a minimal typhoon. After 06 hours, a small eye feature was appeared in satellite imagery, whilst Vamco was upgraded into a Category 2 equivalent .<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.webcitation.org/5j1gF8BDx|title=Past 06 hours, Vamco intensified into a Category 2 equivalent 19-08-2009 12z|date=2009-08-19|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> Early on August 22, Vamco reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 equivalent. Around August 25, Vamco was nearing the southwesternmost Aleutian Islands, and was quickly losing tropical characteristics, as it was becoming more frontal in nature, as well as portions of the eye were quickly eroding. Around the same time, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Vamco. A few hours later, the JMA also issued their final advisory on the weakening storm.

Early of September 13, both JMA JTWC upgraded the system as a tropical storm and assigned its international name, ''Koppu''. In the afternoon, JMA reported that Koppu intensified into a severe tropical storm. On the 14th, the JMA reported that Koppu had intensified to a minimal typhoon, but the JTWC still kept Koppu as a tropical storm for the next few hours but later  acknowledging the intensification and upgraded Koppu to a minimal typhoon. But the JTWC issued their final advisory early on September 15, as Koppu was moving over land, and was expected to dissipate quickly.

In Luzon, a 48 hour rainfall was experienced. In [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]], a 24 hour rainfall was also experienced due to Nando's enhancing southwest monsoon. About 10 provinces were raised in signal warning no.1 from September 12 - September 13. Nando had triggered landslides resulting road closures and evacuations of some residents in [[Kalinga province]].

On September 22, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with the monsoon trough had formed about 720&nbsp;km (450&nbsp;mi), to the east of [[Manila]], Philippines. Satellite imagery showed deep convection starting to consolidate about an LLCC. In the afternoon of the next day, the system started showing good outflow in LLCC and was moving through moderate vertical shear whilst the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression. On the evening of the same day, the JMA reported that the depression weakened into an area of low pressure. In the afternoon of September 24, the JMA reported that the system was organizing again and was upgraded to a tropical depression again, while the PAGASA also upgraded the system to a tropical depression and assigned it the local name ''Ondoy''. On the same day, the JTWC also issued a TCFA on the system. Early the next day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression again. In the evening, the PAGASA reported that Ondoy intensified into a tropical storm. Early on September 26, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm as well. At the same time, JMA also upgraded it as a tropical storm and assigned it the international designated name ''Ketsana''.

In the Philippines, the whole archipelago experienced a torrential rain starting on September 23. more than 30 areas in Luzon, including Metro Manila, were placed under storm alerts as tropical storm "Ondoy" accelerated further and moved closer to Central Luzon. On Bicol region, ferry passengers were suspended during September 25 through the next day due to high waves and heavy rains that were brought by Ketsana into the region affecting about 2000 people. In the Manila International Airport, 13 flights were cancelled due to Ketsana making landfall. Some universities in Manila suspended their classes due to severe flooding in some areas and heavy rainfall.

In addition, the PAGASA also advised residents living in low-lying areas and near mountain slopes in areas affected by the Southwest Monsoon and those under signals #1 and #2 (see below) are alerted against possible flashfloods and landslides. Also, PAGASA has alerted the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) for possible flashfloods and landslides in the affected areas, partcularly in Laguna, Quezon, Zambales, Pampanga and Bataan provinces. Philippine Coast Guard commandant Admiral Wilfredo Tamayo also reminded owners of seacraft of a guideline barring travel for seacraft weighing 1,000 tons or less.

A total of 25 [[provinces of the Philippines|province]]s and Metro Manila were placed under [[state of calamity]], with Metro Manila experiencing a record amount of rainfall in 42 years, with rain falling between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. of September 26 pegged at 341mm, over the record established in June 1967 at 334mm.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/173229/metro-manila-25-provinces-placed-under-state-of-calamity |title=Metro Manila, 25 provinces placed under state of calamity.Ketsana leaves Philippines with more than 300 dead|publisher=GMANews.tv |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2009-09-26}}</ref>

On the next day, JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, submitting its international designated name, ''Parma''. Also, on the same day, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression. On the next day, JTWC again upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. And, by early September 30, due to the storm moving through warm water temperatures, the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a Category 1 typhoon. Satellite imagery also began showing that an eye wall structure had formed. Intensification continued into in the morning of the next day, reaching Category 3 status. Then, after four hours, Parma rapidly strengthened to a Category 4 super typhoon, reaching its peak strength. Different weather bureaus forecasted that Parma would intensify into a Category 5 super typhoon, however, it weakened in the afternoon of October 1 as the eye of Parma began to degrade due to its movement into unfavorable conditions. Parma continued to slightly weaken while moving through the area of [[Cagayan]], then by midday of October 3, it was downgraded into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon. Before it made landfall over northern Cagayan at 3:00 pm PST(07:00 UTC), it weakened into a Category 2 typhoon. Parma crossed northern Luzon over 12 hours, during which the typhoon weakened into a category 1 equivalent typhoon. PAGASA reported that the typhoon was moving almost stationary in their area of responsibility due to interaction with Typhoon Melor and a ridge of high pressure area over mainland [[China]]. At the same time, JTWC downgraded Parma into a tropical storm while the JMA downgraded it into a severe tropical storm. Early the next day, satellite imagery revealed that Parma had an eye center but no convectional cloudiness due to high pressure. Intensification was unlikely because of unfavorable environment conditions and interaction with Typhoon Melor. On October 7, Parma weakens into a tropical depression while it is crossing the northern Luzon and moving out into the Philippine area of responsibility, then PAGASA issued their final warning on Parma. On the next day, both JMA and JTWC reported that Parma re intensified into a tropical storm while it is on south China sea. Intensification is almost difficult due to moderate vertical wind shear. Then by late of October 12, it made it's fourth landfall over [[Hainan]] Island in China. Then, In early of October 14, Parma was downgraded by JMA to a tropical depression due lack of convection. Then by the afternoon of that day, it made it's forth landfall over the coastline of [[Vietnam]]. In the evening, JMA reported that Parma weakens into an area of low pressure, becoming the agency issues their final advisory. However, JTWC still considered Parma as a tropical storm.

On October 6, at 11:00 pm PST (15:00 UTC), Parma made its second landfall over Ilocos Norte. In the afternoon of the next day, PAGASA reported that Parma weakened into a tropical depression near the Isabela area, while both JMA and JTWC still classified Parma as a tropical storm. In the morning of October 8, it emerged back into waters near Isabela. After four hours, Parma made its third landfall in [[Cagayan]]. The next day, Parma crossed Northern Luzon for the second time. Then by the afternoon of that day, Parma exited [[La Union]] and  emerged back into the South China Sea. At the same time, JTWC upgraded it into a tropical storm. On October 10, the JTWC downgraded it back to a tropical depression and once more upgraded it into a tropical storm. On October 12 it made landfall on the island of [[Hainan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Xiong Tong|publisher=Xinhua|date=2009-10-12|accessdate=2009-10-12|title= Tropical storm Parma lands on S China province Hainan|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-10/12/content_12215547.htm}}</ref>

On September 28, an area of convectional cloudiness formed 370&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) to the northeast of [[Pohnpei]]. Satellite imagery showed a Low Level Circulation Centre had begun to form. On the evening of September 28, due to a TUTT that was providing good outflow for the system and low level vertical wind shear with a favorable environment, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Early on September 29, both JMA and JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Early on September 30, JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm and assigned its international designated name, ''Melor''. At the same time JTWC also classified the depression as a tropical storm. Early on October 1, Melor intensified further from a severe tropical storm into a typhoon. Intensification continued, and by the afternoon of the same day the JTWC reported that Melor had intensified into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. In just four hours, it intensified rapidly to a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, and continued to track towards northeast [[Luzon]]. Early on October 2, it strengthened to a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. After levelling out in intensity, it strengthened again on October 3. Early October 4, JTWC reported that Melor had intensified to a Category-5 equivalent super typhoon, with JMA reporting a central pressure of 910 hPa and winds of 205&nbsp;km/h. On October 5, PAGASA allocated the name Quedan to the typhoon as the storm moved into Philippine's area of responsibility. By the midday of October 8, Melor made landfall on Japan. After landfall, JMA downgraded Melor into a severe tropical storm, while the JTWC downgraded it into an extratropical storm. Late on October 9, the remains of Typhoon Melor were absorbed by a newly formed low-pressure system. The remnants of the storm crossed the Pacific and caused record rainfall in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and the [[Central California]] coast.  A rare storm warning was posted for [[San Francisco Bay]] and subsequently, wind gusts were clocked at 77 mph on [[Angel Island]].<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/14/MNL81A4SDF.DTL Rainfall Records Fall in Epic Storm, San Francisco Chronicle, October 14, 2009</ref> Damage is currently estimated at about $1.5 billion (2009 USD).<ref name="Melor Damages">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20091009/NEWS/910099995|title=Typhoon Melor insured damage as much as $1.5B|last=Bradford|first=Michael|date=2009-10-09|publisher=Modeler|accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

On October 6, an area of convectional cloudiness associated with the monsoon trough formed 500&nbsp;km (305&nbsp;mi) to the southwest of [[Saipan]]. Satellite imagery showed a consolidating Low Level Circulation Center with formative convective banding and deep convection over the northern semi-circle. During in the morning of October 8, the system started to move northwest and it's LLCC rapidly became well defined due to favorable conditions. The JMA then upgraded it to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a TCFA on the system, as it had started to become better defined. Then in the evening of that day, it was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC. On October 9, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and assigned its international name ''Nepartak''. After the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, it slowly intensified to a peak intensity of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h), but dissipated on October 14, because the polar jet stream had torn apart the storm.

Early on October 13, the JTWC reported that an area of convection had persisted about 380&nbsp;nm to the northwest of Kwajalein. The convection was disorganised but was starting to consolidate around a broad low level circulation center within a favourable environment to develop further with good vertical windshear and favourable sea surface temperatures. The disturbance rapidly developed throughout that day with a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert issued later that day by the JTWC before advisories were initiated early the next day by the JMA and the JTWC who designated it as Tropical Depression 22W before the JTWC reported that the depression had intensified into a weak tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|title=JTWC Tropical Cyclone 22W Warning 05|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2009101421-WTPN.PGTW|date=2009-10-14|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> On October 15, JMA upgraded it to a Tropical Storm with the name ''Lupit''. On the afternoon of next day, JTWC reported that Lupit strengthened into a Category 1 typhoon. That evening, PAGASA started issuing warnings on Lupit as it entered into their area of responsibility and assigned its local name, ''Ramil''. At the same time JMA also upgraded Lupit into a typhoon. Intensification continued due to favorable conditions and hot water conditions, then by October 17, it rapidly intensified into a Category 3-equivalent typhoon. In the morning of the next day, it strengthened into a Category 4 typhoon, then strengthened further to Super Typhoon classification. On October 20, Lupit weakened to a minimal typhoon.  By the 24th, dry air entrainment and an unfavorable environment had weakened Lupit further to a strong tropical storm, and caused the storm to change track from its westward drift to accelerate northeastward. Later that day, JTWC and PAGASA issued their final warning as Lupit was beginning extratropical transition. However, the JMA continued to issue a on Lupit until early on October 27.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|title=JTWC Tropical Cyclone 22W Warning 44|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/GuamStuff/2009102421-WTPN.PGTW|date=2009-10-25|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref>
