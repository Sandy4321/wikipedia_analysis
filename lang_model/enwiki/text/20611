The plot centres around a character named Alan Dale, based on the historical [[Alan-a-Dale]]. When he's caught stealing by the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], Sir Ralph Murdac; the possible actual sheriff of the time,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.robinhoodloxley.net/mycustompage0035.htm |title=Nottingham Sheriffs - Robin Hood Outlaw - robinhood Little John Loxley Barnsdale Sherwood Nottingham |publisher=Robinhoodloxley.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref> Alan flees into the company of [[Robin Hood]], notorious and infamous outlaw.

==Reception==
The novel has been relatively well received by reviewers and authors alike. Gareth Wilson, of Falcata Times, stated that "The tale is not only well written but told with a freshness that has a sense of history injected as the tale clearly shows".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://falcatatimes.blogspot.com/2009/07/historical-fiction-review-outlaw-angus.html |title=Falcata Times: HISTORICAL FICTION REVIEW: Outlaw - Angus Donald |publisher=Falcatatimes.blogspot.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2011-10-28 |first=Gareth |last=Wilson}}</ref> Author Faith L. Justice stated in her blog that she found ''Outlaw'' to be "fast-paced with well-developed characters, plot twists, and an exciting climax. I read the second half of the book straight through. It<U+2019>s a well-told tale. I<U+2019>d recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction and enjoys a different take on an old story.". Justice also felt, however, that she "didn't want to read about another selfish person being held up as a hero. I want a modern-day Robin Hood (or better yet thousands of Robin Hoods) to stand up to power and make things better. Donald<U+2019>s mafia boss Robin didn<U+2019>t do it for me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithljustice.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/review-outlaw/ |title=Book Review and Giveaway <U+2013> "Outlaw" by Angus Donald <U+00AB> Historian's Notebook |publisher=Faithljustice.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2011-10-28|first=Faith L.|last=Justice}}</ref>

Conversely, fellow historical fiction author [[Ben Kane]] stated that "Outlaw is a thoroughly welcome addition to my bookshelf", describing Donald's depiction of 13th century England as "excellent, well researched and full of detail; so too are his gripping fight scenes. His torture scenes are excruciatingly well written <U+2013> I found myself cringing at two of them in particular."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benkane.net/tuesday-10th-may-angus-donald-outlaw/ |title=Angus Donald <U+2013> Outlaw |publisher=Benkane.net |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-10-28|first=Ben|last=Kane|authorlink=Ben Kane}}</ref> It was also accredited as the "D<U+00E9>but of the month" by Lovereading for July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovereading.co.uk/book/3453/Outlaw-by-Angus-Donald.html |title=Outlaw by Angus Donald - Lovereading UK |publisher=Lovereading.co.uk |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref>
