The '''Bristol School''' is a term applied retrospectively to describe the informal association and works of a group of artists working in [[Bristol]], [[England]], for a period during the early 19th&nbsp;century. This period was mainly the 1820s, although the origins and influences of the school have been traced over the wider period 1810&ndash;40.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/> 

The school initially formed around [[Edward Bird]] some years before his death in 1819.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/><ref name="GreenacreTate13"/> [[Francis Danby]] was a participant from around 1818&ndash;19<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/><ref name="Adams13"/> until he left Bristol for London in 1824,<ref name="GreenacreTate22_24"/> although he remained connected for another decade.<ref name="Adams13"/> Other artists involved were [[Edward Villiers Rippingille]], [[Samuel Jackson (artist)|Samuel Jackson]], [[James Johnson (artist)|James Johnson]], [[Nathan Cooper Branwhite]], [[William West (artist)|William West]], [[James Baker Pyne]] and [[Paul Falconer Poole]].<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/>

Amateur artists were also members. These included John Eagles, Francis Gold and his brother Henry, John King and George Cumberland.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/> Cumberland was a friend of [[William Blake]] and of many important members of the [[Royal Academy]].<ref name="Adams10"/> Patrons of the school included the [[antiquarian]] [[George Weare Braikenridge]] and the industrialists John Gibbons, Daniel Wade Acraman and Charles Hare.<ref name="Greenacre27"/>

The group conducted evening sketching meetings and sketching excursions to scenic locations around Bristol, in particular the [[Avon Gorge]], [[Leigh Woods]], Nightingale Valley and [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]] Valley. Works by the group often featured these locations.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/> A variation on this theme is ''The Avon Gorge from the summit of the Observatory'' (1834), an oil painting by West from the vantage point that he built for himself on top of [[Clifton Down]].<ref name="GreenacreSea96"/> Depictions of the sketching excursions taking place in these landscapes include Danby's ''View of the Avon Gorge'' (1824), Johnson's ''The Entrance to Nightingale Valley'' (1825), and Rippingille's ''Sketching Party in Leigh Woods'' (c.&nbsp;1828).<ref name="GreenacreSea68_70"/> Imaginary, fantasy landscapes in monochrome [[wash painting|wash]] were common subjects of the evening meetings, usually taking inspiration from the Bristol scenery.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/><ref name="GreenacreTate22_24"/><ref name="Greenacre18_21"/>

One of the most important events for the school was the first exhibition of the work of local artists at the new [[Bristol Institution]] in 1824.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/> The organisers of this exhibition included Jackson, Johnson, Rippingille and Branwhite.<ref name="Greenacre166"/> 

There were other artists working in Bristol during this period who do not seem to have been participants in the school's activities. These included [[Rolinda Sharples]],<ref name="Greenacre211"/> Samuel Colman<ref name="Greenacre203_204"/> and some of the [[topography as the study of place|topographical]] artists working for Braikenridge such as [[Hugh O'Neill (artist)|Hugh O'Neill]],<ref name="Greenacre255"/> [[Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham]]<ref name="Greenacre261_262"/> and Edward Cashin.<ref name="Greenacre269_270"/>

In late 1832 or early 1833 the informal Bristol School was succeeded by the establishment of a formal sketching club for evening meetings. The founder members of this club included Jackson, West and Rowbotham, plus [[William James M<U+00FC>ller]], [[Henry Brittan Willis]], [[John Skinner Prout]], Robert Tucker and William Evans. Other artists involved were Pyne, S.C. Jones and M<U+00FC>ller's younger brother Edmund Gustavus M<U+00FC>ller. This club seems to have lasted in some form into the 1840s.<ref name="Greenacre9_14"/><ref name="Hudson21"/> In 1832 Bristol also saw the first exhibition by the new [[Bristol Society of Artists]].<ref name="Herrmann162"/>
