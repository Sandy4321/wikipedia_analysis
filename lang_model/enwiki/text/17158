==Career==
===Film career===
[[Image:Shilpa Shetty backstage.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Shetty at the Miss Bollywood-The musical]]
Shetty started her career by modelling for [[Limca]] in 1991 at age 16,<ref>{{cite web|work=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|title=Shilpa denies any underworld connection|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/48771.cms|accessdate=3 January 2007}}</ref> and made her film debut in 1993 with ''[[Baazigar]]'', portraying a woman murdered by her [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] boyfriend. Shetty took the supporting role of Seema, co-starring alongside [[Shahrukh Khan]] and [[Kajol]]; the film was a major success and earned her a nomination for [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award]].<ref>{{cite web|work=filmfareawards.indiatimes.com|title=Filmfare nomination for Shetty|url=http://filmfareawards.indiatimes.com/articleshow/articleshow/368610.cms|accessdate=23 January 2007}}</ref>

Her first leading role was in the film ''[[Aag (1994 film)|Aag]]'' in 1994, which was averagely received at the box office. She had a hit that same year with the film ''[[Main Khiladi Tu Anari]]'' opposite [[Akshay Kumar]].<ref>{{cite web

Shetty starred in another big film that year, ''[[Aao Pyaar Karen]]'', followed in 1995 by ''[[Hathkadi]]'', where she was working alongside actors such as [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] and [[Madhoo]], but they failed at the box office. 1997 was one of her busiest years: she appeared in six different films, beginning with the [[Telugu language]] film ''Veedeva Dani Babu''. Her first major Bollywood film of that year was the action thriller ''[[Auzaar]]''. Shilpa portrayed the character of Prathna Thakur alongside actors [[Salman Khan]] and [[Sanjay Kapoor]]. In 1998, she had one release, ''[[Pardesi Babu]]'', for which she received critical acclaim and won the [[Bollywood Movie Awards|Bollywood Movie Award]] for ''Best Supporting Actress''.
In 2000, Shetty received much acclaim for her role in ''[[Dhadkan]]'' which earned reasonable takings at the Indian box office.<ref>{{cite web

She would later go on to star with [[Anil Kapoor]] and [[Karisma Kapoor]] in the film ''[[Rishtey]]'' (2002). Her comic performance as an eccentric fisherwoman was appreciated and she received a nomination under the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award]] category and various nominations for Best Comedian as well.<ref>{{cite web

2004 was also a good year for Shetty with the release of ''[[Garv: Pride and Honour|Garv]]'' in which she portrayed a [[Muslim]] orphan and disillusioned [[table dance]]r starring opposite [[Salman Khan]]. According to Shetty, she chose to do the film because she liked the subject. The film was a [[cop drama]].<ref name="rediffheart"/> However, she received much acclaim for her performance in ''[[Phir Milenge]]'', where she made a sensitive portrayal of a successful city high-flyer who contracts [[HIV]] via [[unprotected sex]] and becomes a [[social stigma|social outcast]] as a result. The film, based on 1993's ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', was perceived to have tackled a [[Taboo|social taboo]] as yet unaddressed by Bollywood.<ref name="bbcprofile"/> The film earned Shetty a Filmfare Best Actress nomination, and provided an impetus for her HIV-related charity work ([[Shilpa Shetty#HIV-AIDS|see below]]). Film critic [[Taran Adarsh]] from ''[[indiaFM]]'' noted, "Phir Milenge belongs to Shilpa Shetty completely. She delivers, what can be rightly called, the performance of her career. The viewer feels and empathizes with the character mainly because of her effective portrayal. She conveys the pain and the emotional upheaval through her expressive eyes, making it amongst the most memorable performances the year has seen so far."<ref>{{cite web

This marked a break from the previous trend of superficial song-and-dance items in favour of roles which have a greater depth of character,<ref name="rediffheart"/> exemplified by her film ''[[Dus]]'' (2005), an action thriller. Although it received average returns at the box office,<ref>{{cite web

Shilpa had one release in 2006, the much delayed ''[[Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar]]''.

Shetty was once featured in [[Mani Ratnam|Mani Ratnam's]] stage show, [[Netru, Indru, Naalai]].

2007 proved to be Shetty's most successful year at the box office so far. Her first release, ''[[Life In A... Metro]]'', won a significant reception, and became the first Bollywood movie to premiere at [[Leicester Square]].<ref>{{cite web | work=Ibnlive.com | title=Shilpa's World Premiere in London | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/showbiz/05_2007/pics-shilpas-big-day-in-london-40046.html | accessdate=1 July 2007}}</ref>
The film performed well at the box office, and was declared a semi-hit within three weeks. Additionally, the film was critically acclaimed and Shetty's performance was appreciated, with [[Rajeev Masand]] of [[CNN-IBN]] writing, "It's a terrific performance and unquestionably Shilpa's best to date."<ref>{{cite web|author=Masand, Rajeev|work=Ibnlive.com| title=Masand's verdict: Metro|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/masands-verdict-metro/40402-8-p1.html|accessdate=29 December 2007}}</ref> Her second release, alongside three Deols, [[Dharmendra]], [[Sunny Deol|Sunny]] and [[Bobby Deol|Bobby]], the drama ''[[Apne]]'', was also a box office success.

During an interview on ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', Shetty confirmed that she had been asked to act in the British ''[[EastEnders]]'' [[soap opera]], and turned it down as it would mean all her other arrangements would have to go on hold.<ref>{{cite web

She was the subject of a [[Sky One]] documentary entitled ''The Real Shilpa Shetty'', which was produced by British television production company [[Twofour]]. The large number of commercial offers that Shilpa received after winning [[Celebrity Big Brother]] themselves became reason for controversy with an increasing number of accusations about her riding the 'racism' wave to commercial gain.<ref>{{cite web | work=Bollyrock.com | title=Shilpa Shetty To Milk Britons Dry | url=http://www.bollyrock.com/?p=13 | accessdate=1 July 2007}}</ref> She was on the cover of the first issue of [[OK!|OK!

===Bigg Boss===
In August 2008, Shetty began hosting the second season of ''[[Bigg Boss (Season 2)|Bigg Boss]]'', the Indian version of ''Big Brother''. Controversially, [[Jade Goody]] was one of the initial housemates. Goody left the Bigg Boss House early in the series after receiving news that she had [[cervical cancer]], of which she later died on 22 March 2009.

===Indian Premier League===
In February 2009 Shilpa and her husband [[Raj Kundra]] became part owners of the [[Indian Premier League]] franchise cricket team [[Rajasthan Royals]] by paying approximately US $15.4 million for a 11.7% stake.

==Other commitments==
As well as [[Model (person)|modeling]] and acting, Shetty has associated herself with several other commercial and non-profit organizations.

===HIV-AIDS===
In February 2006 Shetty lent support to a BBC World Service Trust television show designed to tackle the problem of [[HIV-AIDS]] in India.<ref name="bbcaids">{{cite news | work=news.bbc.co.uk | title=Bollywood stars in BBC Aids show

According to reports, she participated in order to show [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] with HIV-AIDS sufferers.<ref name="bbcaids"/>

The issue is particularly close to Shetty's heart as she had portrayed an HIV-positive sufferer in her 2004 movie ''[[Phir Milenge]]''. Speaking about the movie and HIV in general, Shetty said: "Why not a film on HIV positive patients? It is a social stigma in our society. We made this film to highlight this problem&nbsp;... This film will bring about a social awareness about AIDS in our country. It is high time we talked about this in our society".<ref name="rediffheart"/>

She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them.

The petitioner further demanded that the images be confiscated under the terms of the Press and Registration of Book Act 1867.

Shetty responded that she had not received any court summons and also discounted the charges. She further claimed that the pictures were freeze-frame shots from a recent movie that only exposed her [[navel]]. "As far as my photographs go, what is obscene about it?
