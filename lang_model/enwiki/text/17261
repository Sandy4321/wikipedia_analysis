'''Lanford Wilson''' (April 13, 1937{{ndash}} March 24, 2011) was an American [[playwright]] who helped to advance the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theater movement.<ref name=NYTimes1>Fox, Margalit. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/theater/lanford-wilson-pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-dies-at-73.html "Lanford Wilson, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Playwright, Dies at 73",]  ''The New York Times'', March 24, 2011</ref>  He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1980, was elected in 2001 to the [[Theater Hall of Fame]], and in 2004 was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].  He was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]] and won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. 

Wilson was raised in the Midwest by his mother but moved to California where he worked and attended college.  In California, Wilson lived with his father, who did not accept Wilson's homosexuality, and so, in 1957, he moved to Chicago, where he studied playwriting.  In 1962, he moved to New York and began to write plays for [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatres.  His 1964 short play, ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'', was his first significant success and led to further works treating gay identity and other social and romantic issues throughout the 1960s.  In 1969, he was a co-founder of [[Circle Repertory Company]], for whom he wrote many plays in the 1970s.   His 1973 play, ''[[The Hot l Baltimore]]'', was the company's first major hit with both audiences and critics; its [[Off-Broadway]] run exceeded 1,000 performances.

Wilson's ''[[Fifth of July]]'' was first produced at Circle Rep in 1978; for its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opeining in 1980, he received his first Tony Award nomination.  A sequel, ''[[Talley's Folly]]'' (1979 at Circle Rep.) opened first on Broadway and won him the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and received another Tony nomination. ''[[Burn This]]'' (1987) was another Broadway success.  Wilson also wrote the [[libretto|libretti]] for several 20th-century operas.  In later years, he lived mostly in [[Sag Harbor]] on [[Long Island]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Wilson was born to Ralph Eugene and Violetta Tate Wilson in [[Lebanon, Missouri]]. After his parents' divorce, he moved with his mother to [[Springfield, Missouri]], where they lived until she remarried.  He had two half-brothers, John and Jim, and one stepsister, Judy.<ref name=NYTimes1/>  When he was 11, they moved to [[Ozark, Missouri]].<ref name=Barnett2>Barnett, p. 2</ref> There, he attended high school and developed a love for film and art.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} As a child, he enjoyed writing short stories and going to see plays performed at Southwest Missouri State College (now [[Missouri State University]]).<ref>Barnett, p. 1</ref> He developed an interest in acting and played roles in his high school plays, including Tom in "[[The Glass Menagerie]]" by [[Tennessee Williams]].<ref>Barnett, p. 51</ref>

After graduating from Ozark High School in 1955, Wilson began his collegiate studies at Southwest Missouri State College.<ref name=BarnettChrono>Barnett, ''Chronology''</ref> In 1956, he moved to [[San Diego, California]], where his father had relocated after his parents' divorce.<ref name=Barnett2/> He studied art and art history at San Diego State College (now [[San Diego State University]]) and also worked as a riveter in the Ryan Aircraft Plant.<ref>Barnett, pp. 2<U+2013>3</ref> His time with his father proved to be difficult, leaving Wilson feeling unwanted and unaccepted as a homosexual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He left school and moved to Chicago in 1957, where he worked as a graphic artist for an advertising firm.<ref name=BarnettChrono/> During this time, Wilson realized that the short stories he had always enjoyed writing would be more effective as plays, and so he took playwriting at the [[University of Chicago]] extension.<ref>Barnett, p. 3</ref><ref>Jones, Chris.

===Career===
In 1962, Wilson moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City.  He worked in odd jobs before finding a job in the subscriptions office of the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].{{cn|date=November 2011}}  Wilson began his professional career as a playwright writing [[one-act play|one-act plays]] for [[Caffe Cino]], a coffeehouse and small theatre run by [[Joe Cino|Joseph Cino]], a pioneer of the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre movement. <ref>[http://caffecino.wordpress.com/1939/01/01/lanford-wilson/ Caffe Cino Pictures: Lanford Wilson: The Mozart from Missouri]</ref><ref>Williams, p. 17</ref><ref>Barnett, p. 4</ref> His works for Caffe Cino include ''Ludlow Fair'', ''[[Home Free!]]'' and ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]''.

The play concerns Leslie Bright, a neurotic aging [[drag queen]].  It is an important early stage representation of [[homosexuality]], but Wilson stated, "If it's taken as the first homosexual play, I have a feeling that I'm not very fond of it. ...  That will pass, I think, and it'll be just the story of a lonely person."<ref>Barnett, p. 14</ref> It ran for over 200 performances,<ref name=Barnett5>Barnett, p. 5</ref> setting a record as the longest-running play at Caffe Cino.<ref>Busby, p. ?</ref>{{page?}}

In addition to writing plays, Wilson wrote the texts for several 20th-century [[opera]]s, collaborating with composer [[Lee Hoiby]] for ''Summer and Smoke'' (1971), and adapting his own play, ''This is the Rill Speaking'' (1992).<ref name=ON>[http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=19386 "Lee Hoiby, 85, American Opera Composer, Has Died",] ''Opera News'', March 28, 2011</ref><ref name=Kennedy/> ''Summer and Smoke'' is an adapatation of the [[Tennessee Williams]] [[Summer and Smoke|play of the same name]].
