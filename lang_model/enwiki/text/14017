The '''Summer Palace''' (<U+041B><U+0435><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0434><U+0432><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+0446>) is a diminutive residence of [[Peter the Great]] that was built in 1710-14 in his new capital, [[St. Petersburg]], on the bank of the [[Fontanka River]], in what is now the [[Summer Garden]]. The design was by [[Domenico Trezzini]].<ref name="enc"/> This simple Dutch-style ([[Petrine Baroque]]) mansion contains just 14 main rooms.<ref name="museum">[http://www.rusmuseum.ru/museum/complex/let_sad/let_palace/ The palace on the website of Russian Museum]</ref>

The mansion was designed as an entertainment pavilion and was intended for warm weather use only. Peter moved into the partially completed palace in 1712 and spent summers here until his death in 1725. He occupied the lower level while his wife [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]] preferred the upper rooms.<ref name="museum"/>

An innovative feature of this palace is the still extant [[central heating]] system which featured solid fuel burning boilers and elaborate [[porcelain]] ductwork, with extensive ornamental painting. The ornamental frieze and bas-reliefs are attributed to [[Andreas Schl<U+00FC>ter]].<ref name="enc"/>

Peter's daughter [[Elizaveta Petrovna]] had [[Summer Palace (Rastrelli)|her own Summer Palace]] built on the [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]] slightly to the west. The older palace has stood untenanted since the 1840s. Its [[oak]] interiors were reconstructed in the early 1960s.<ref name="enc">[http://www.encspb.ru/article.php?kod=2804004813 Encyclopaedia of St. Petersburg]</ref> The house was open to the public as a branch of the [[Russian Museum]] until it closed down for repairs in 2009.
