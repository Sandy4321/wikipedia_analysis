He studied [[theology]] and [[sociology]] in Hamburg, London, St Louis, Chicago, and at [[Harvard University]], Boston, where he obtained his PhD.

Meinardus befriended the Coptic monk Father Antonius, who in 1971 became Pope [[Shenouda III]], the current head of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. Dr. Meinardus became an active member of several research institutions for Coptic studies in Cairo<ref name="otto-meinardus-stiftung.de">www.otto-meinardus-stiftung.de</ref>.

Meinardus was, with other non-Egyptian faculty at the American University in Cairo, expelled from Egypt shortly before the Six-day War of 1967. He served as pastor in several other countries and returned to Germany in 1975 were he became pastor and later professor in Middle Eastern Religions at the [[University of Hamburg]]<ref>Arab-West Report, 2005, week 39, art. 37</ref>.

==Professional career==
Dr. Meinardus was a prolific writer; his books and articles became a main source of reference on the Coptic Orthodox Church. He is generally recognized in the West as the most important contemporary Western authority on the Church in Egypt<ref>John H, Watson and Cornelis Hulsman in Watani, September 25, 2005 and Arab-West Report, 2005, week 39, art. 37, 38 and 39</ref>. From 2000 to 2005, Dr. Meinardus served on the board of advisers of [[Arab-West Report]], an Egyptian electronic magazine<ref>Arab-West Report, 2005, week 39, art. 38</ref>. One year prior to the death of Dr. Meinardus, the Otto Meinardus Stiftung (foundation) was established<ref name="otto-meinardus-stiftung.de"/> with the purpose of preserving the intellectual heritage of Dr. Meinardus.

Dr. Meinardus was the author of the first book published by the AUC Press, "Monks and Monasteries of the Egyptian Deserts,<U+201D> in 1961. A revised edition of the book was still in print 45 years later. Meinardus was also the author of the following AUC Press books, "Christian Egypt Ancient and Modern,<U+201D> (1965) "Christian Egypt Faith and Life,<U+201D> (1970) "The Holy Family in Egypt,<U+201D> (1986, a reprint of a book he wrote around 1960) "Die Heilige Familie in Agypten,<U+201D> (1988) "Monks and Monasteries of the Egyptian deserts,<U+201D> Revised Edition (1988) "Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity,<U+201D> (2000) "Coptic Saints and Pilgrimages,' (2002) He also wrote a chapter in <U+201C>Christian Egypt: Coptic Art through Two Millennia,<U+201D> edited by Massimo Capuani (2002). His last book <U+201C>Christians in Egypt: Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Communities Past and Present,<U+201D> was published posthumously  in 2006<ref>Cornelis Hulsman, Arab-West Report, 2005, week 39, art. 37</ref>.

Many articles appeared in [[Kmt (magazine)|Kemet]] (Germany), [[Coptologica]] (Canada), [[Coptic Church Review]] (USA) and other mainly theological academic publications.

Otto Meinardus had his own style of studying the church. He not only looked into relevant manuscripts in Western libraries, but also met with [[desert fathers]], grasped their spirituality, and documented mostly oral traditions in an academic style<ref name="Cornelis Hulsman 2005">Cornelis Hulsman, Arab-West Report, 2005, week 39, art. 39</ref>.

In his books for the American University in Cairo Press, Meinardus was careful not to offend his Coptic readers. However, in Kemet, he was more open and questioned certain Coptic traditions and beliefs<ref name="Cornelis Hulsman 2005"/>. A list of articles published in Kemet can be found on the Web site of the Otto Meinardus Stiftung<ref name="otto-meinardus-stiftung.de"/>.
