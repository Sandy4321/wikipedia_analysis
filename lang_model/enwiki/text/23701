In October 2005, speaking about his early life, Bouazza said: ''"Sometimes I didn<U+2019>t go to school because all that I wanted was to play football. It was football, football.

==Club career==
===Watford===
Bouazza moved to England in 2003, aged sixteen when he earned a scholarship at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] after a trial.<ref name="mail1233530"/><ref name="ffc101007"/>

He made his first team debut as an 88th minute substitute on 7 February 2004 in a 2<U+2013>2 with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Vicarage Road]]. A week later he scored on his full debut, a 2<U+2013>0 home win over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref name="bbc3468171">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3468171.stm|title=Watford 2-0 Preston|date=14 February 2004|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''|accessdate=23 January 2010}}</ref>

He made a total of nine appearances in the [[2003<U+2013>04 in English football|2003<U+2013>04 season]]. The [[2004<U+2013>05 in English football|following season]] he made 28 league and eight cup appearances, scoring three goals.

During the [[2005<U+2013>06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06 season]] he was overshadowed by [[Darius Henderson]], [[Marlon King]], and [[Ashley Young]] and missed a lengthy spell with a broken [[metatarsal]] but this didn't prevent him scoring three goals in nineteen games, one of which was the fourth in Watford's 4<U+2013>1 win over [[Football League Championship|Championship]] runners-Up [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].

On 6 October 2005 Bouazza was loaned out to [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], initially for one month,<ref name="bbc4315774">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/4315774.stm|title=Swindon seal Bouazza loan swoop|date=6 October 2005|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''|accessdate=23 January 2010}}</ref> before having the loan extended until the end of the year.<ref name="bbc4415954">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/4415954.stm|title=Swindon extend Bouazza loan spell|date=7 November 2005|publisher=''[[BBC Sport]]''|accessdate=23 January 2010}}</ref> He scored three goals in 15 games.

Throughout the [[2006<U+2013>07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07]] season, with Watford in the [[Premier League]], Bouazza started most of the league games, principally as a left-sided winger, scoring five goals.

===Fulham===
On 8 August 2007, Bouazza joined Premier League side [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], on a four-year deal, for an initial fee of <U+00A3>3m, which could rise to <U+00A3>4m, depending on appearances, and Fulham's divisional status.<ref name="bbc6927453">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/6927453.stm|title=Fulham complete Bouazza transfer|date=8 August 2007|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref>

On 23 August, he left Sivasspor, stating that that he did not wish to remain in Turkey, and agreeing a mutual termination of his contract.

==International career==
Although born in France, Bouazza was approached by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Alg<U+00E9>rienne de Football]], to play at national level for them. Bouazza accepted, explaining later: ''"I grew up in Paris, yes, but I<U+2019>ve always known my nationality. I am Algerian, just as my father and mother are. My grandmother lives just outside [[Algiers]], and I have many cousins there."''<ref name="ffc101007"/>

Bouazza made his debut for [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] on 7 February 2007 and scored his first goal in a 3-2 victory over [[Mali national football team|Mali]] on 20 November 2007.

On 13 November, as the Algerian squad arrived in [[Cairo]] for their vital World Cup qualifier against Egypt the following day, Bouazza was one of a number of players who narrowly avoided injury when their [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] was ambushed.<ref name="mail1227699">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1227699/Premier-League-stars-caught-coach-ambush-FIFA-concern-players-injured.html?ITO=1490#ixzz0WqcKc0OG|title=Premier League stars caught in coach ambush: FIFA concern after two players injured|date=14 November 2009|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|accessdate=14 November 2009}}</ref> A rock smashed the window next to Bouazza, just missing his head. He then laid on the floor to protect himself.<ref name="mail1233530"/> Speaking later about the attack, Bouazza said: ''"I had a very bad feeling when we landed at the airport because there was no security. And when our coach was attacked on the road from the airport to the city, it was the most terrifying experience of my life. People threw rocks at at us, and there was nobody to stop them. Some of the players were hit by flying glass and I only escaped because I was lying on the floor. That is no way to prepare for a World Cup match."''<ref name="mirror234719">{{cite news|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/mike-walters/Wally-meets-Algerian-international-and-Blackpool-winger-Hameur-Bouazza-article234719.html|title=Wally meets...
