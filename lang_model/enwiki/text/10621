The '''Federal Triangle''' is a [[Triangle|triangular]] area in [[Washington, D.C.]] formed by 15th Street NW, [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution Avenue NW]], [[Pennsylvania Avenue|Pennsylvania Avenue NW]], and E Street NW. Federal Triangle is occupied by 10 large city and federal office buildings, all of which are part of the [[Pennslvania Avenue Historic District]]. Seven of the buildings in Federal Triangle were built by the U.S. federal government in the early and mid 1930s as part of a coordinated construction plan that has been called "one of the greatest building projects ever undertaken",<ref>Lee, Antionette Josephine. ''Architects to the Nation: The Rise and Decline of the Supervising Architect's Office.'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000, p. 241. ISBN 0195128222</ref> and all seven are architecturally historic. The [[Federal Triangle (Washington Metro)|Federal Triangle]] [[Washington Metro]] station serves Federal Triangle and the surrounding area.

==Federal Triangle name==
The name "Federal Triangle" appears to have been a journalistic invention.  The press made reference to a "Pennsylvania Avenue Triangle" as early as November 18, 1916,<ref name="Pick" /> and use of this name continued as late as June 1929,<ref name="IRSCornerstone">"The Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon." ''New York Times.'' May 26, 1929.</ref><ref name="HooverHails" /><ref name="MellonRain">"Revenue Building Cornerstone Laid By Mellon In Rain." ''Washington Post.'' May 21, 1929.</ref> but it was more common for the news media to refer to the area as "the Triangle" by 1927.<ref name="Whitaker" /> This name was in use by 1928, even by government officials,<ref name="Speers">Speers, L.C. "Washington's Aspect Is Undergoing Change." ''New York Times.'' March 18, 1928.</ref> and still used as of late 1934.<ref name="McCormick">McCormick, Anne O'Hare. "Building the Greater Capital." ''New York Times.'' May 26, 1929.</ref><ref name="HooverEnlarges" /><ref name="AdamsGrows">Adams, Mildred. "Washington Triangle Grows." ''New York Times.'' October 7, 1934.</ref> The [[Associated Press]] first used the term "Federal Triangle" (with both words capitalized) in 1935.<ref>"Capitol Triangle at Last Completed." ''Associated Press.'' August 4, 1935.</ref> The ''New York Times'' first used the term in 1936, although the paper's capitalization of both words did not become standardized until 1939.<ref>For examples, see: George, Frank. "Eat More Fish, Uncle Sam Urges." ''New York Times.'' November 1, 1936; "Farm Building Is Biggest." ''New York Times.'' August 1, 1937; "Building Progress Is Wide In Capital." ''New York Times.''

''New York Times.'' July 28, 1940; Reston, James B. "L'Enfant's Capital." ''New York Times.'' June 1, 1941.</ref> Definitions of the area also varied at first.  Early news reports believed the eastern apex of Federal Triangle extended as far east and south as the [[Ulysses S. Grant Memorial]] in front of the [[United States Capitol]].<ref name="Whitaker" /><ref name="Speers" /> But almost all reports referred to Pennsylvania Avenue NW and 15th Street NW was the Triangle's northern and western boundaries.<ref name="Whitaker" /><ref name="Speers" /><ref name="AdamsGrows" />

==Genesis and design==
[[File:James McMillan.jpg|thumb|left|Senator James McMillan, who led the commission which wrote the "McMillan Plan" for guiding the development of Washington, D.C.]]

Federal Triangle (as the area would be renamed) had its genesis in 1926.  An attempt to provide $50 million to fund, among other things, a national archives building and develop federal offices along Pennsylvania Avenue NW was proposed in 1925.<ref>"New Grandeur to Come to Washington." ''[The New York Times|New York Times.'' February 8, 1925.</ref> The effort saw success in 1926 with the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the ''[[Public Buildings Act]]'', which authorized<ref>Authorization legislation establishes a program that will later spend the money, but may not provide any funding. An appropriation is needed to actually fund the program. See: Rieselbach, Leroy N. ''Congressional Politics: The Evolving Legislative System.'' 2d ed. New York: Westview Press, 1995.

:*A national archives building, with total cost of land and construction to be $6.9 million ($1 million appropriated in fiscal 1927).<ref>Just days earlier, the Commission of Fine Arts and Public Building Commission pegged the cost of the proposed Archives building at $2 million. See: "Archives Building to Cost $2,000,000 Decide Upon Here." ''Washington Post.'' May 29, 1926.</ref>
:*A new [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Bureau]] building, with total cost of land and construction to be $7.95 million ($1.7 million appropriated in fiscal 1927).
:*A new Department of Commerce building, with total cost of construction to be $10 million ($600,000 appropriated in fiscal 1927).
Treasury officials said the Archives building was their top priority, followed by the Internal Revenue building, two [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] projects, and the Commerce building last.<ref name="BuildingsProvided" /> At that time, no provision was made to construct a new building for the Department of Justice and no sites were named for construction of the three announced buildings.<ref name="Wide" /> Preliminary plans for the Commerce building were presented to the Commission on Fine Arts and Public Building Commission in mid-June.<ref>"Commerce Building Plans Are Outlined to Fine Arts Body." ''Washington Post.'' June 18, 1926.</ref> On July 7, the Treasury Department and Commission of Fine Arts announced sites and sizes for the three previously-announced structures.

The July 7 announcement appears to have made this selection final. See: "Prospective Archives Location Is Reported." ''Washington Post.'' June 2, 1926.</ref> The government owned three of the four plots needed for the Internal Revenue site, but none of the land beneath the proposed Archives building.<ref name="FourSites" /> Purchasing both sites, officials estimated, would cost $700,00 each.<ref name="FourSites" />  Treasury officials also proposed at this time adding a Justice building on Pennsylvanie Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets NW, and a Labor building (facing 15th Street) between 14th and 15th Streets NW and D Street NW and Ohio Avenue NW.<ref name="FourSites" /> Preliminary plans for these buildings were expected to be presented in three months.<ref name="FourSites" />

[[File:Grand Central Palace - Central Market.jpg|thumb|left|Center Market in the 1920s.]]
The purchase of land delayed the construction program considerably over the next several years. Center Market, designed by [[architect]] [[Adolf Cluss]] and built in 1872, was the largest of the District of Columbia's markets, serving tens of thousands of people a day at a time when [[general store]]s and [[greengrocer]]s were uncommon in the city.<ref name="Goode" /> It was also a hub for transportation in the District of Columbia, as the city's [[tram|trolley]] lines converged there.<ref name="Goode" /> At the time it was built, it was the largest food market in the United States<U+2014>with space for more than a thousand vendors, the city's first [[Refrigeration|cold-storage]] vaults, its own ice storage facility, and its own [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] [[water well|well]].<ref name="Goode" /> Center Market, however, occupied two blocks between 7th and 9th Streets NW on the north side of B Street NW.<ref name="Goode" /> As early as August 1926, planners recognized that relocating Center Market and purchasing land from owners eagerly seeking inflated prices from the federal government would delay the Federal Triangle project significantly.<ref>"U.S. Building Program Here Is Being Delayed." ''Washington Post.'' August 18, 1926.</ref> Early negotiations with private landlowners in the area collapsed early on when owners demanded exhorbitant prices for their properties, and the city and federal government began [[Eminent domain|condemnation]] proceedings in late August 1926 against owners on B Street NW between 10th and 13th Streets.<ref>"U.S. Building Sites Adjacent to Mall to Be Condemned."

''Washington Post.'' November 18, 1926.</ref>
:*A new Department of Justice building, to be located between Pennsylvania Avenue NW and D Street NW, and 14th and 15th Streets NW.
:*A new "General Supply" building, to be located between 14th and 13th Streets NW between D and C Streets NW.
:*A new Independent Offices building, to be located between 12th and 13th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW (cutting off the last block of Ohio Avenue NW; this was the original proposed site of the National Archives in June 1926).
:*A new Department of Labor building, to be located between 13th and 14th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW.
:*A new [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] building, to be located between 9th and 10th Streets NW and B and C Streets NW.
:*Moving the Department of Commerce site from the National Mall to between 14th and 15th Streets NW between C and B Streets NW.
:*Moving the National Archives site northward to between 12th and 13th Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW and C Streets NW (cutting off D Street NW).
:*Retaining the previously announced site of the Internal Revenue building.
The Public Buildings Commission also announced it would build an 1,800-car parking lot next to the Department of Commerce building, and would proceed with construction of the Commerce and Archives first (as they were the top priority).<ref name="Developing" /><ref name="Pick" /> Three months later, the estimates for construction of the Commerce building was increased to $16 million from $10 million and for the Internal Revenue building to $10.5 million from $2.5 million.<ref>"$2,275,000 Is Asked For Building Work In City Next Year."

[[File:John-russell-pope-LC-nodate.jpg|thumb|John Russell Pope, one of the key architects of Federal Triangle.]]
Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927. On May 6, an ''ad hoc'' committee comprised of Olmsted; Medary; Charles Moore, chair of the Commission on Fine Arts; and Louis E. Simon, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, recommended relocating the Justice building from 15th Street NW to a lot further east so that traffic congestion at 15th and Pennsylvania might be alleviated.<ref name="PlannersSuggest">"Planners Suggest Justice building Location Change." ''Washington Post.'' May 7, 1927.</ref> This ''ad hoc'' committee met again three days later to not only consider the Justice building relocation but also to considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures.<ref>"Mall Building Plans To Be Discussed Today." ''Washington Post.'' May 10, 1927.</ref> The Public Buildings Commission considered the same plan on May 16.<ref name="CommissionToday">"Commission Today to Discuss Moving of Justice Office."

''Washington Post.'' May 18, 1927.</ref> However, disagreements among the three planning bodies proved so fundamental that a new Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups on the development of Federal Triangle.<ref>"Architects Chosen to Advise on Plans for Mall Triangle." ''Washington Post.'' May 20, 1927.</ref> The Board consisted of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury (Louis E. Simon) and six private architects, including [[Louis Ayers]], [[Edward H. Bennett]], [[Arthur Brown, Jr.]], [[William Adams Delano]], [[Milton Bennett Medary]], and [[John Russell Pope]].<ref name="Worthy" /><ref name="Wentzel" /> The Board of Architectural Consultans first met on May 23, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures.<ref>"Architects Considering Public Buildings Plan." ''Washington Post.'' May 24, 1927.</ref> As the Board of Architectural Consultants began its deliberations, the Commission on Fine Arts approved a plan to locate the Justice building on the north side of B Street NW between 7th and 9th Streets NW (where Center Market stood).<ref>"Justice Structure Is Planned On Site of Center Market." ''Washington Post.'' May 29, 1927.</ref> About two weeks later, the Public Buildings Commission approved the single structure plan.<ref name="TwoGroups">"Federal Building In 2 Groups, Third Mall Plan Reveals." ''Washington Post.'' June 17, 1927.</ref> This plan envisioned a central plaza (defined by 13th, 14th, B, and D Streets NW) surrounded by a [[traffic circle]], with the buildings lining the exterior of the traffic circle.<ref name="TwoGroups" /> Few streets would be closed; rather, arches would connect each building to its neighbors (with only 12th Street NW remaining unbridged).<ref name="TwoGroups" />

The final design of Federal Triangle began to come together in June 1927. The Board of Architectural Consultants approved the construction of the Commerce and Internal Revenue structures as stand-alone buildings on the sites last proposed in late June.<ref>"Federal Building Plans Announced By Treasury." ''Washington Post.'' June 21, 1927.</ref> In July, the Board proposed eight buildings, sited as follows:<ref name="StudiedByBoard">"Triangle Sites Studied By Architectural Board." ''Washington Post.'' July 12, 1927.</ref>
:*Archives (surrounded by Interstate Commerce on the north, east, and south)
:*Commerce (west side of 15th Street NW between B and D Streets NW)
:*General Accounting (13th, 14th, B, and C Streets NW)
:*Independent Offices (6th, 7th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
:*Internal Revenue (B, 10th, 12th, and C Streets NW)
:*Interstate Commerce (9th, 10th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
:*Justice (7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW)
:*Labor (B, 13th, 14th, and C Streets NW)
The Board did not address the future of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, or Southern Railway Building, but had tenatively agreed to continue with the "Louvre plan" of a ring of buildings joined by arches.<ref name="StudiedByBoard" />

The first design contract for any of the buildings in Federal Triangle was statutorily required by Congress in 1926 as part of the ''Public Buildings Act''. A new headquarters for the Deparment of Commerce had been proposed in 1912 and a contract for the design work awarded to the architectural firm of [[York and Sawyer]].<ref name="Whitaker" /> Although this building was never built, Congress honored the contract and named the firm again as the Commerce building's designer.<ref name="Whitaker" /> By March 1927, government officials had already decided that the Commerce building should be 1,000 feet (305 metres) long<U+2014>making it the then-largest building in the District of Columbia.<ref name="Whitaker" /><ref name="PlansCapitol">"Plans Capitol Buildings." ''New York Times.'' September 29, 1927.</ref>  The May 1927 work moratorium, however, put these plans on hold. In September 1927, the design of the Internal Revenue was handed over to Louis Simon at the Treasury Department, and the Commission of Fine Arts met to discuss proposed plans for both the Commerce and Internal Revenue buildings.<ref name="PlansCapitol" /><ref>"Plans to Be Considered For Commerce Edifice." ''Washington Post.'' September 28, 1927.</ref> At the same time, the Commission received bids on demolition of existing structures in the Triangle.<ref name="PlansCapitol" /><ref name="TheCommerce">"The Commerce Building." ''Washington Post.'' September 18, 1927.</ref>

''Washington Post.''

Plans for the eastern apex of Federal Triangle, however, were complicated by plans to create a George Washington Memorial.  A George Washington Memorial Association was organized in 1898 to establish in the District of Columbia a university bearing Washington's name.<ref name="GWMemorial">[http://siarchives.si.edu/findingaids/FARU7471.htm "George Washington Memorial Association, Records, 1890-1922."

''New York Times.''

Two major changes to the complex came in early 1930. The Board and other planning groups had long agreed to site the Justice Department building on the block bounded by 7th, 9th, and B Streets NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. But this plan changed in March 1930. Architect John Russell Pope made a proposal to move the Justice and Archives switch sites so that the Justice building would have more space.<ref name="Cannadine" /> Although the change would entail major design alterations in both buildings, Secretary Mellon favored the idea.  The Commission on Fine Arts approved the plan,<ref name="Cannadine" /> and Mellon met with the Board of Architectural Consultants in late March 1930 to discuss the idea.<ref>"Mellon to Discuss Changing of Sites." ''Washington Post.'' March 28, 1930.</ref> Although this initial meeting left the issue unresolved,<ref>"Site of New Justice Building Undecided." ''Washington Post.''

Architectural models of the proposed Federal Triangle development were unveiled in late April 1929.<ref name="Beautified">"Beautified Capital Shown By Models." ''New York Times.'' April 28, 1929.</ref> Design work on the Independent Offices, Justice, and Labor buildings also began at that time.<ref name="Beautified" /> After these models were unveiled, however, the Board once more made changes to the Federal Triangle construction plan to reflect the March and April changes made by Hoover and Mellon.

Parking and traffic issues proved immensely vexing for the planners of Federal Triangle.<ref name="Whitaker" /> The original L'Enfant Plan setting out the streets of the District of Columbia still existed in the Federal Triangle area.<ref name="Worthy" /> Both C Street NW and D Street NW still ran from 15th Street NW to 15th Street NE.  Ohio Avenue NW ran in a northwest-southeast line from the intersection of D and 15th Streets NW to the intersection of B and 12th Streets NW (soon to be renamed as Constitution Avenue NW and 12 Street NW). Louisiana Avenue NW still ran in a southwest-northeast direction from 10th and B Streets NW to 7th and D Streets NW (along what is currently the diagonal portion Indiana Avenue NW). The McMillan Plan was developed before the widespread use of the automobile, and now the Board of Architectural Consultants had to decide how to accommodate the "horseless carriage" while also making Federal Triangle pedestrian-friendly.<ref name="Worthy" /> The Board began studying traffic issues in late 1927.<ref name="FinalIndorsement" /> A major study of parking needs and solutions was conducted in 1931, and traffic and parking patterns assessed again after the Department of Commerce building opened in early 1932.<ref>"Study of Triangle Parking Needs Near." ''Washington Post.'' December 30, 1931.</ref> To achieve some of the traffic and parking goals, the east-west streets and diagonal avenues were eliminated, leaving only the north-south streets through the area, and 12th and 9th Streets NW were submerged in tunnels beneath the National Mall.<ref name="Worthy" /><ref>"State Names For Streets Slated Today." ''Washington Post.'' January 30, 1936.</ref> In the first major change to the Board's "final" plans, the Grand Plaza was abandoned in favor of a parking lot.<ref name="Worthy" /> The Board considered a number of other solutions to the need to accommodate the more than 7,500 cars expected to arrive every day (including an underground bus terminal and underground parking garage under the Grand Plaza), but in the end only approved a small number of underground parking spaces beneath the Apex Building.<ref name="Worthy" /><ref>"Underground Terminal Suggested for Buses."

===Design influences===
[[File:Napoleon Apt Louvre Paris 2008oct08.jpg|thumb|left|The Palais du Louvre in Paris, France, an inspiration for the Federal Triangle complex.]]
The design of Federal Triangle was significantly influenced by the [[Louvre]]-[[Tuileries Palace]] complex in [[France]] and the concentration of government buildings in [[Whitehall]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="PlannersSuggest" /><ref name="CommissionToday" /><ref name="Worthy" /><ref name="Wentzel" /> But planning for the complex was also deeply influenced by the [[City Beautiful movement]] and the idea of creating a [[civic center]] to achieve efficiency in administration as well as reinforce the public's perception of government as authoritative and permanent.<ref name="Worthy" /> For the architectural style of the buildings, the Board relied heavily on the McMillan Plan's recommendation of the Neoclassical style.<ref name="Worthy" /> Both the Board and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Andrew W. Mellon]] rejected the [[Modern architecture|Modern]] style then heavily in vogue.<ref name="Worthy" /> Rather than a mass of tall, imposing buildings, two unifying open spaces (intended for ceremonial use, and under discussion by the Board at least by March 1928) would be utilized.<ref name="Speers" /> The first would be a Circular Plaza (inspired by the [[Place Vend<U+00F4>me]])<ref name="McCormick" /> bisected by 12th Street NW, and which would required the demolition of the [[Old Post Office Pavilion]].<ref name="Wentzel" /><ref name="Speers" /> The second would be a rectangular Grand Plaza on the east side of 14th Street NW between the proposed [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] building (west side of 14th Street NW) and the proposed [[United States Postal Service|Post Office Department]] building (east side of 13th Street NW).<ref name="Wentzel" /><ref name="Speers" /> The construction of the Grand Plaza would have required the demolition of the [[John A. Wilson Building|District Building]].<ref name="Wentzel" />

The Board received significant input from the Commission of Fine Arts (which strongly advocated implementation of the McMillan Plan), National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, and the [[Greater Washington Board of Trade|Washington Board of Trade]].<ref name="Wentzel" /> One guiding principle for the project was that office space for at least 25,000 federal workers must be included.<ref name="Wentzel" /> Another was that, although the buildings would be modern steel frame structures, they would each be the same height and faced with [[limestone]].<ref name="Worthy" /> The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had the least influence over the overall design of the project, primarily because it had only recently been formed.<ref name="Worthy" />

Although Board unveiled its proposed design for the project in 1929, the design still lacked a unifying architectural look.<ref name="Cannadine" /> Subsequently, John Russell Pope was asked in September 1929 to bring a more uniform style to the buildings.<ref name="Cannadine" /> Nonetheless, within this more uniform approach, a variety of styles could be used, and were: [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] for the Department of Commerce building, [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] for the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] building, and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] for the Post Office Department.<ref name="Worthy" /> Meanwhile, the Board worked with sculptors, painters, and others to design more than 100 statues, fountains, bronze doors, murals, plaques, and panels (but interior and exterior) throughout the complex.<ref name="Wentzel" /> Modern architectural styles were not completely ignored in the design effort, however; most of the doors and grillwork throughout the Federal Triangle complex were [[Art Deco]] in style.<ref name="Worthy" />

==Construction of original seven buildings==
[[File:Oldpostoffice southernrailway districtbuilding c1932.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Looking southwest at the Old Post Office Pavilion (far left), Southern Railway Building (middle), and District Building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., in 1932.]]
The Treasury Department signed a contract for razing of existing buildings at the Internal Revenue site in October 1926.<ref name="TwoContracts" /> The size of the Commerce building was set at 1,000 feet long in March 1927, and survey work at the site began on March 31, 1927 (despite final plans for the project still unclear).<ref name="Whitaker" /><ref name="DateSet" /> Work on all buildings was postponed in May 1927.<ref name="PlannersSuggest" />  Work began again in September 1927 when demolition work on the Commerce and Internal Revenue sites began again.<ref name="PlansCapitol" /><ref name="TheCommerce" /> Excavation of both sites began on November 21, 1927.<ref>"Work on New Federal Buildings Starts Soon." ''Washington Post.'' November 18, 1927; "Contractors Start Excavating On Site of Revenue Office." ''Washington Post.'' November 22, 1927.</ref> Additional demolition contracts were awarded for both sites in April 1928,<ref>"Contract to Wreck Buildings Awarded." ''Washington Post.''

''Washington Post.'' June 8, 1930.</ref> Work on Internal Revenue's superstructure began on March 8.<ref>"New Internal Revenue Structure Is Started." ''Washington Post.'' March 9, 1929; "First Steel Work Set For Revenue Building." ''Washington Post.'' March 22, 1929.</ref>

The cornerstone of the first building to be constructed, the Internal Revenue building, was laid by Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon on May 25, 1929.<ref name="IRSCornerstone" /><ref name="MellonRain" /> While digging its foundation, workers uncovered a dock which was at least 100 years old.<ref>[[Tiber Creek]] had once run along B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue NW), and the dock had once extended into Tiber Creek.  In 1815, Tiber Creek was straightened and connected to and became part of the [[Washington City Canal]]. The canal fell into disuse by the 1850s. Tiber Creek was enclosed by a masonry tunnel beginning in 1878 and the tunnel connected to the city's sewer system so that the creek's natural flow would help flush sewage into the [[Potomac River]]. Much of the area immediately south and west of the B Street NW and the Washington Monument was, at the time, part of the Potomac River. After a disastrous flood in 1881, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] dredged a deep channel in the Potomac and used the material to fill in the Potomac (creating the current banks of the river) and raise much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly six feet (two metres).  One or more of these actions buried the Tiber Creek dock. See: Tindall, William. ''Standard History of the City of Washington From a Study of the Original Sources.'' Knoxville, Tenn.: H.W.

''Washington Post.'' April 14, 1929.</ref> By now, the cost of the Commerce building had risen to $17.5 million.<ref name="HooverHails" /><ref name="ReadySoon" /> Due to the formerly [[marsh]]y condition of the soil and several submerged streams nearby, more than 18,000 [[deep foundation|pilings]] had to be set to construct the Commerce building.<ref name="DuPuy" /> Water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek made it too difficult to drive the piles.<ref name="Barrows">Barrows, George H. "Department of Commerce Home Baffles Writers Trying to Visualize Structure." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1931.</ref> So a [[Surface supplied diving|deep-sea diver]] descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 feet (6.1 metres) deep into the earth.<ref name="Barrows" /> A hose was inserted into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished.<ref name="Barrows" /> The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|October 1929 stock market crash]] and subsequent [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] led newly-elected President [[Herbert Hoover]] to increase spending on existing public works as a means of stimulating the economy.<ref name="Cannadine" /> No funds had been authorized yet for the Archives, Independent Offices, Justice, or Labor buildings, and Hoover secured an additional $2.5 million a year for 10 years from Congress for this purpose.<ref name="Cannadine" /><ref>"Archives Building Bill Before House."

Treasury officials hoped to have the Post Office building under construction and ground broken for the Justice building by December 1930.<ref>"$300,000,000 Program for Washington Told." ''New York Times.'' May 17, 1930.</ref> But a major design change and funding choices were made in 1930. Pope convinced the Commission on Fine Arts to switch the positions of the Department of Justice and National Archives, giving the Justice building more space.<ref name="Cannadine" /> Congress also amended the Public Buildings Act to permit private (not just federally-employed) architects to bid on design contracts, and agreed to fund the construction of the Justice, Labor/ICC, National Archives, and Post Office buildings.<ref name="Cannadine" /><ref>For a time, the design of the Archives and Post Office buildings included the diversion of cool water from Tiber Creek to cool the buildings. See: "River Use to Cool Building Weighed." ''Washington Post.'' July 29, 1931; "Home of Federal Records Will Bring Dignity to Seventh St." ''Washington Post.'' December 22, 1933.</ref>

1931 saw much of the Federal Triangle project near completion. In March 1931, Congress appropriated $3 million to begin construction of the Apex Building, the last structure to be funded.<ref name="Cannadine" /> Demolition began on the site the following November.<ref>"Pennsylvania Ave. Razing Is Continued."

January 3, 1932.</ref> The finished building had 1,605,066 square feet (148,271.1 square metres) of office space (more than 60 percent larger than originally planned), and its foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged [[Tiber Creek]].<ref name="ReadySoon" /> Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system, to cool the building.<ref name="Barrows" /> July saw the construction contract for the $7.67 million Justice Department building signed.<ref>"Justice Building Contract Awarded."

In 1934, one building began construction and another finished. The Apex Building site began to be cleared in April.<ref name="Eyesore" /> The Post Office building was occupied on May 6,<ref>"Postoffice Staff Finally Starts Moving Into New Structure."

Although some structures had been razed on the site, no appropriation had been made for the Apex Building.<ref name="AdamsGrows" /> The government had also cleared land northeast of the Internal Revenue building (as planners considered adding yet another building to the Triangle), but Congress was increasingly opposed to demolishing either the Old Post Office or the District Building.<ref name="AdamsGrows" /> City officials considered selling the District Building to the federal government as a means of raising cash to building a new city hall, but federal officials balked at the idea.<ref>"Plan to Sell City Building Is Revived."

The Labor/ICC and Archives buildings were opened in 1935. Numerous strikes (see below) had delayed the opening of the building for almost a year. In April 1934, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins asked for additional (if minor) design changes.<ref>"Miss Perkins Asks Change in Labor Building." ''Washington Post.'' April 16, 1934.</ref> Pressing needs for office space meant that a portion of the ICC building was occupied before the structure was finished.<ref name="Within">"U.S. Triangle Buildings To Be Up Within Year."

Mellon Auditorium]] in 1987).<ref name="AtLast" /><ref>The ICC was not the only agency to take up space in the building.  Due to the proliferation of [[New Deal]] government agencies and the lack of office space in the city, the ICC was forced to share office space for several years with the [[Federal Radio Commission]], the [[Resettlement Administration|Subsistence Homesteads Division]] of the Department of the Interior, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|Soil Erosion Service]] of the Department of the Interior. See: "I.C.C. to Share Its Building." ''Washington Post.'' May 26, 1934.</ref> Meanwhile, construction forged ahead on the Archives building. Already considered too small to hold all the materials in its possession, a proposal had been made to add another story to the building.<ref name="Addition">"Archives Building Addition Dropped." ''Washington Post.'' March 26, 1935.</ref> This proposal was rejected in March 1935.<ref name="Addition" /> The National Archives building was occupied in November 1935, but had no formal dedication. Although the Archives structure had been one of the top priorities of almost all planners, it was one of the last buildings to be opened. Archives staff began moving into the building in November 1935, and the exhibition rotunda was opened to the public in November 1936.<ref>"Murals Portraying Nation's Birth Shown." ''New York Times.''

The Apex Building was the last to be constructed and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed to make way for the [[Eccles Building|Federal Reserve Board Building]].<ref name="Reserve">"Commission Asks Aid on New Home." ''Washington Post.'' June 15, 1935.</ref> The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building.<ref name="Reserve" /> Testing for the foundation began in Septebmer 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter.<ref>"Borers Test Site of Apex Building." ''Washington Post.'' September 3, 1936.</ref> With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936.<ref>"$3,105,000 Contract Let For Building in District."

One of the most important aspects of the new building was the group of massive sculptures to be installed on either side of the structure.  A jury of four nationally-known sculptors ([[Paul Manship]], [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]], [[Lee Lawrie]], and [[William E. Parsons]]) selected the artist in January 1938.<ref name="ReliefRolls">"Sculptor, on WPA Relief Rolls, Wins $45,600 Federal Contract." ''Washington Post.''

Artwork, exterior details, landscaping, and other finishing touches on the construction of Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934.<ref name="DCPlanning" /> To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), the north and west grounds of the [[Washington Monument]] were raised in the summer of 1938 about six feet (two metres) in order to form a [[dike]] against any future floodwaters.<ref>"Dike Will Protect Federal Triangle." ''Washington Post.'' January 16, 1938.</ref> The final art installation in the complex was the [[Oscar Straus Memorial|Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain]], designs for which were first considered in December 1933.<ref name="Ponders" /> Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month.<ref name="Views" /><ref>"D.C.

==Federal Triangle and the Bonus Army==
In June 1932, thousands of homeless [[World War I]] veterans, their families, and their supporters occupied the recently-condemnded assemblage of buildings at the Federal Triangle site as part of the [[Bonus Army|Bonus March]] on the capital to win better veterans' benefits.<ref>The main Bonus Army camp was actually across the [[11th Street Bridges]] in the [[Anacostia]] neighborhood of D.C., more than three miles away.</ref><ref name="Wentzel" /><ref name="BonusArmy">Dickson, Paul and Allen, Thomas B. ''The Bonus Army: An American Epic.'' New York: Walker and Company, 2004. ISBN 0802714404</ref>

On July 28, 1932, President Hoover ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] to remove the "Bonus Army" from the site.<ref name="BonusArmy" /> At 4:45 p.m., MacArthur led 1,200 infantry, 1,200 cavalry, and six battle tanks (commanded by Major [[George S. Patton]]) to Federal Triangle to remove the Bonus Army.<ref name="BonusArmy" /> More than 20,000 civil service workers (leaving their offices for the day), watched as the U.S. Army attacked its own veterans.<ref name="BonusArmy" /> Patton personally led a cavalry charge (with sabers dawn) into the mass of homeless people, and several hundred rounds of [[adamsite|vomit gas]] were launched at the marchers.<ref name="BonusArmy" /> A Bonus marcher was killed on the site of the Apex Building.<ref name="Eyesore">"Fine Arts Chairman Asks Eyesore Elimination on Lower Mall." ''Washington Post.'' April 25, 1934.</ref> The Federal Triangle site was cleared and these members of the Bonus Army marched to Anacostia<U+2014>where, at 10:14 p.m., MacArthur led a second attack on the 43,000 protesters and burned their camp to the ground.<ref name="BonusArmy" />

==Labor issues during 1930s construction==
Labor-management troubles occurred throughout construction of the initial seven buildings in the Federal Triangle complex in the 1920s and 1930s. Much of Washington, D.C.'s, construction workforce was [[trade union|unionized]] many years before the project began. All the building contractors employed by the federal government signed three-year contracts with the major labor unions representing their workers in September 1929, in the hope that this would eliminate any disruptions during the building program.<ref>"Labor Pacts Ends Building Worries." ''Washington Post.'' September 17, 1929.</ref> But this hope proved false.

The first problem occurred in July 1930, when the [[Lathe|lathers]] union [[strike action|struck]] to win a $2 per day (16.7 percent) pay increase, halting work for a short period of time on the Archives, Interstate Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Post Office sites.<ref>"Strike of Lathers May Be Adjusted At Meeting Today." ''Washington Post.'' July 10, 1930.</ref> A second strike occurred in late summer 1931 over a new federal wage law. The [[Davis-Bacon Act]] was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931. On August 4, 1931, painters working on the Internal Revenue building struck, arguing that out-of-town workers were being imported into the city to work on the building and being paid $5-to-$7 a day rather than the prevailing local wage rate of $11 a day.<ref>"Painters Protest Wages On Job At Revenue Building." ''Washington Post.'' August 4, 1931.</ref> Both the Treasury and Labor Departments stepped in to arbitrate the strike.<ref>"Painters' Pay Row Settlement Near." ''Washington Post.'' August 6, 1931.</ref> The dispute was settled a few days later when the Labor Department found that the contractor had paid the correct wages, and that no workers were being paid overtime.<ref>"Meeting to Settle Painter Wage Fight." ''Washington Post.'' August 7, 1931; "Federal Builders Painters' Wages Defended in Reply." ''Washington Post.'' August 8, 1931.</ref><ref>During the Great Depression, the federal government and labor unions discouraged businesses from asking existing workers to pay overtime.  With unemployment skyrocketing, businesses instead were encouraged to hire temporary workers, so that more people might work and thus feed and shelter themselves (as well as stay off public assistance rolls). See: Schlesinger, Arthur M. ''The Age of Roosevelt: The Crisis of the Old Order, 1919-1933.'' Paperback ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1957. ISBN 0618340858</ref>

The construction project's labor troubles worsened in 1933. With the Depression worsening, contractors were pressing for a 27.3 percent wage cut with their unions, particularly the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America|carpenters' union]]. On January 6, 1933, a fire swept through the upper floors of the unfinished ICC building.<ref>"Flames Damage New I.C.C. Building." ''Washington Post.'' January 7, 1933.</ref> The fire was ruled [[arson]] and a "disgruntled carpenter" was suspected.<ref>"Sabotage Scheme Seen in I.C.C. Fire." ''Washington Post.'' January 8, 1933.</ref> Two weeks later, the [[International Union of Operating Engineers|operating engineers]] and [[United Association|steamfitters]] unions engaged in a [[jurisdictional strike]] against one another, stopping work at the Post Office construction site, but the AFL intervened and arbitrated a solution to the dispute.<ref>"Postoffice Strike Laid Before A.F.L. For Early Decision." ''Washington Post.'' January 21, 1933.</ref> The earlier wage dispute, however, had not been resolved, and by February a general strike among all unionized workers at the Federal Triangle complex seemed likely.<ref>"General Strike Looms In May Pay Slash Row." ''Washington Post.'' February 5, 1933; "Mall Wage Cutting Struggle to Reach Decision This Week." ''Washington Post.'' February 6, 1933; "Walkout on 7 Triangle Jobs Is Threatened." ''Washington Post.'' February 7, 1933.</ref> Employers said they would fire all unionized workers if a strike occured and replace them with [[strikebreaker]]s.<ref>"Labor Marks Time As Crisis Nears In Mall Wage Battle." ''Washington Post.'' February 8, 1933.</ref> The two sides agreed to let the Treasury Department arbitrate their dispute,<ref>"Labor Disputants Look to Treasury in Mall Impasse." ''Washington Post.'' February 10, 1933.</ref> and on February 13 the government ruled in favor of the unions<U+2014>averting a job action.<ref>"Mall Workers Win Ruling On $11 Daily Wage." ''Washington Post.'' February 14, 1933.</ref> The employers went to court, and in April 1933 the carpenters agreed to the 27.3 pecent wage cut.<ref>"Carpenters Accept Wage Scale of $8." ''Washington Post.'' April 15, 1933.</ref>

The second major wage dispute of 1933 broke out in May. On May 26, more than 500 members of the [[Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association|plasterers' union]] struck to prevent a $2 (14.3 percent) pay cut, halting all work on the seven active Federal Triangle constructions sites.<ref>"Fight On Plasterer Wages Halts Work On 7 U.S. Buildings." ''Washington Post.'' May 27, 1933.</ref> The employers and the [[American Institute of Architects]] both argued that the higher wage would inhibit economic recovery in the construction industry.<ref>"Builders Protest Plasterers' Wage." ''Washington Post.'' May 30, 1933; "Architects Rap $14 Plaster Pay." ''Washington Post.'' June 8, 1933; "Plasterers $14 Pay Delays Normalcy Architects Assert." ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1933.</ref> To prove their point, the employers [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]] the workers; the strike collapsed, and plasterers went back to work on July 22.<ref>Pay, it should be noted, did not actually drop to $12 a day until September 8, 1933. See: "Plasterers Back At Work Tomorrow." ''Washington Post.'' July 23, 1933.</ref>

August 1933 saw the eruption of a series of labor-management disputes and inter-uniion squabbles that put construction of the Federal Triangle complex on hold for several months. The first event was when the [[Laborers' International Union of North America|Journeyman Stonecutters Association of North America]] walked out on a jurisdictional strike against the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|iron workers' union]] on August 21, idling 225 men working on the Post Office building.<ref name="Walkout">"Walkout on U.S. Building Costs $500 Each Day." ''Washington Post.'' September 1, 1933.</ref> The dispute was over which union would ride with crane operators to coordinate the movement of loads with workers on the ground.<ref name="Walkout" /> The strike lasted at least until September 7, with both sides seeking a decision from the American Federation of Labor.<ref>"Strikers Wait For Employers To End Dispute." ''Washington Post.''September 7, 1933.</ref> Then on September 1, 75 carpenters walked off the job in a jurisdictional dispute with the iron worker's union.<ref name="Serious">"U.S. Building Strike Takes Serious Turn." ''Washington Post.'' September 12, 1933.</ref> This dispute, which occurred at the Labor/ICC building, was over which workers would be permitted to install decorative enclosures around radiators.<ref name="Serious" /> With work on the Labor/ICC buildings already two months behind schedule due to the earlier labor disputes, the employers threatened to stop all work if the carpenters' union struck and throw another 1,000 men out of work.<ref>"Strike Is Likely To Halt Public Building Work." ''Washington Post.'' September 13, 1933.</ref> The employers shut down on September 15.<ref>"1,000 Workers Will Be Idle In Union Row." ''Washington Post.''

September 16, 1933.</ref> Twenty security guards were stationed at the Labor/ICC building to prevent vandalism.<ref>"U.S. Building Labor Dispute In Deadlock." ''Washington Post.'' September 17, 1933.</ref> On September 18, a third jurisdictional strike occurred when the [[United Association|boilermakers' union]] walked off the job at the Federal Triangle central heating plant to protest the use of iron workers in the erection of smokestacks for the facility.<ref name="Heating">"Heating Plant Work Is Halted By New Strike." ''Washington Post.'' September 19, 1933.</ref> Construction of the smokestacks continued, but construction of the boilers was halted.<ref name="Heating" /> A fourth jurisdictional strike erupted on September 20, when 80 members of the [[International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers|bricklayers' union]] walked off the job at the heating plant to protest the use of [[Laborers' International Union of North America|laborers]] to caulk windows, stone, and roof tiles.<ref>"U.S. Projects Face Walkout Of Bricklayers." ''Washington Post.'' September 21, 1933.</ref> Although the bricklayers remained on the job for the moment, government officials feared that [[sympathy strike]]s would occur, stopping work at all seven construction sites.<ref name="UnionRejects">"Union Rejects U.S. Building Job Arbitration." ''Washington Post.'' September 23, 1933.</ref><ref>"U.S. Officials Fearing Spread Of Labor Row." ''Washington Post.'' September 24, 1933.</ref> The carpenters rejected a call for the government to arbitrate the strike,<ref name="UnionRejects" /> and the employers asked for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert F. Wagner]] (a proponent of organized labor) to help settle the disputes.<ref>"Stewart Asks Wagner's Help In Labor Row." ''Washington Post.'' September 26, 1933.</ref> On September 26, the AFL ruled that the smokestack work properly belonged to the iron workers, and ordered the boilermakers back to work.<ref name="Ordered">"Heating Plant Boilermakers Ordered Back." ''Washington Post.'' September 27, 1933.</ref> But the carpenters' union initiated a new protest, arguing that the installation of pulley linings in elevators belonged to them and not to the [[International Union of Elevator Constructors|elevator constructors' union]].<ref name="Ordered" /> And the Washington Building and Construction Trades Council threatened to call a general strike of all construction workers if the bricklayers were not pulled off the job installing boiler insulation and the [[International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied Workers|asbestos workers' union]] allowed to do the job instead.<ref name="Ordered" /> Senator Wagner also said on Sept. 28 that he believed a resolution to the carpenters/iron workers dispute (which had led to the layoff of 1,000 workers at the Labor/ICC building) could be reached.<ref name="Ordered" /><ref name="Silent" /> But the boilermakers did not return to work, leaving 450 workers laid off.<ref name="Silent">"Boilermakers Silent in Move To Halt Strike." ''Washington Post.'' September 28, 1933.</ref> Meanwhile, government officials said that the caulking, insulation, and pulley work disputes would be resolved soon, and would not in any case cause further distruptions at construction sites.<ref name="Silent" /> Another major work disruption threatened the Federal Triangle complex when the iron workers' union demanded that contractors initiate two four-hour shifts per day rather than one eight-hour shift per day in order to spread work among more men.<ref name="FourHour">"Four-Hour Day Demand Halts U.S. Building." ''Washington Post.'' October 4, 1933.</ref> When contractors balked, the union struck at the Post Office and Justice building sites.<ref name="FourHour" /> That strike lasted two days before about half of the employers capitulated.<ref>"Strike Perils I.C.C.-Labor Elevator Work." ''Washington Post.'' October 7, 1933.</ref> But it continued for the remaining employers at the Justice and Post Office buildings.<ref>"Work Stopped By Contractor In Labor Row." ''Washington Post.'' October 11, 1933.</ref> Finally, on October 11, 1933, frustrated and angry Labor Department officials said that unless the jurisdictional disputes were ended quickly, the government would seek authorization from Congress in January to force the unions back to work and resolve the disputes itself.<ref>"Plan to Break U.S. Buildings Strikes Told." ''Washington Post.'' October 12, 1933.</ref> The threat worked:  On October 13, all parties to all jurisdictional disputes agreed to return to work while continuing to seek resolution to their problems via other channels.<ref name="Abandon">"1,000 Abandon Strike in U.S. Building Row."

The labor peace was short-lived. Four unions refused to do work on the Post Office [[conveyor belt]] system in mid-November,<ref>"Labor Dispute Still Delaying Post office Job." ''Washington Post.''

==Federal Triangle's first half-century==
The continuing existence of the District Building, Old Post Office Pavilion, and Southern Railway building as well as parking issues became points of contention during Federal Triangle's first 50 years. District of Columbia officials said in 1958 that they were willing to have the District Building torn down and Federal Triangle "finished" (if the city was properly compensated), but a lack of federal funds defeated the move.<ref>Eisen, Jack. "Delay for Federal Triangle Foreseen in Lack of Funds." ''Washington Post.'' May 8, 1958.</ref> In 1995, the D.C. and federal governments signed an agreement in which the federal government would construct a new top floor and renovate the building (at a cost of $47 million) in return for a 20-year lease on 130,000 square feet (12,090 square metres) of space in the structure.<ref>Schneider, Howard.

As many critics had anticipated during Federal Triangle's construction in the 1930s, parking issues grew much worse due to the development's existence.<ref>"Federal Triangle Blamed for Traffic Snarl." ''Washington Post.''March 23, 1941.</ref> In the late 1950s, a proposal was made to build a commuter and long-distance bus terminal at Federal Triangle as well as a large office building on the space of the parking lot, but the $60 million it would take to build the terminal was never provided.<ref>"Top Decision Expected On Midtown Terminal." ''Washington Post.'' May 20, 1959.</ref> The parking issue became so vexing that the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] ordered its own parking study in 1959.<ref>Eisen, Jack. "White House Orders Parking Space Study." ''Washington Post.'' May 31, 1959.</ref> There were several attempts to remove the parking lot in the interior of Federal Triangle and build the long-planned Great Plaza. The first such move came in 1955, when the Commission of Fine Arts asked the federal government to build the plaza, but nothing came of the proposal.<ref name="GreatPlaza" /> A second effort was made in 1972, with the goal of building the Great Plaza in time for the national bicentennial in 1976, but the required $36.7 million in federal funds were not forthcoming.<ref>Green, Stephen. "Funds Denied For Building Grand Plaza." ''Washington Post.'' June 20, 1972.</ref> The parking lot was leased to a private company in 1979.<ref>"Court Backs U.S. in Suit Over Parking Lot." ''Washington Post.'' July 25, 1979.</ref>

[[File:Federal Triangle pylon.jpg|thumb|The Federal Triangle Metro station was opened at Federal Triangle on July 1, 1977.]]
Several other outstanding issues regarding Federal Triangle's development were also raised, and occasionally resolved, in the next half-century. The closure and elimination of Ohio and Louisiana Avenues NW led each state's representatives to seek to rename other streets in the District of Columbia after those states. Ohio Drive NW came into existence in 1949, after Congress passed legislation authorizing the name change of the drive along the [[Tidal Basin (District of Columbia)|Tidal Basin]].<ref>"Ohio's Name Goes on D.C. Street Today." ''Washington Post.'' August 12, 1949.</ref> Another issue remaining from Federal Triangle's development regarded the condemnation of railway tracks in the area.  The Mount Vernon, Alexandria and Washington Railway argued that it had not been properly compensated for the loss of its tracks in the area, and in 1943 sought federal relief.<ref>"Bill Would Enable Railway to Sue For Loss-Recovery." ''Washington Post.'' February 20, 1943.</ref>

Some improvements were made to Federal Triangle, however.  A new cooling plant was built in 1960.<ref>"Big Cooler Approved For Federal Triangle." ''Washington Post.'' January 8, 1960.</ref> Beginning in 1970, all the buildings were floodlit at night in order to reduce the level of crime in the area.<ref>Hodge, Paul. "9 Buildings to Get Bright New Lights."

==Ronald Reagan Building construction==
{{main|Ronald Reagan Building}}
Even as parking and traffic issues continued to cause controversy at Federal Triangle in the 1960s and 1970s, efforts were under way to remove the parking lot and "finish" Federal Triangle by building a large office building on the site.  The first effort came in 1972, when the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon administration]] proposed building a $126 million office building on the lot in time for the national bicentennial in 1976.<ref>Eisen, Jack. "76 Finish Sought for 'Triangle'." ''Washington Post.'' January 25, 1972.</ref> But this proposal was never seriously contemplated or funded. One outcome of the Nixon proposal, however, was "the Weese Plan." The Nixon administration commissioned the architecture planning firm of Harry Weese & Associates to come up with a master plan for the continued development of Federal Triangle.<ref name="SquareDeal" /> The Master Plan (which became known as "the Weese Plan") did not only propose a massive new federal office building on the parking lots of the Triangle.  It also proposed a new series of pedestrian paths throughout the complex, titled "Federal Walk."<ref name="SquareDeal" /> Federal Walk would not only be a network of sidewalks designed to showcase the architecture of Federal Triangle; it also included destinations such as spots for tourists to wait for tours of the interiors of each building, outdoor art, places for rest and contemplation, and even cafes and restaurants.<ref name="SquareDeal" /> Federal Walk was gradually implemented in piecemeal fashion over the next 15 years, although it still remained incomplete as of 1997.<ref name="SquareDeal" /> GSA held a competition in 1982 to select a design for a 10-story office building to replace the parking lot, but planning bodies refused to approve the plan.<ref>Miller, Tim. "GSA to Begin Selection Of Triangle Designers." ''Washington Post.'' February 20, 1982; Eisen, Jack. "Office Building on Great Plaza Denied." ''Washington Post.'' April 23, 1982.</ref>

Plans for construction of an office building on the Federal Triangle parking lot site finally found support in 1986. The Federal City Council,<ref>[http://www.federalcitycouncil.org/ Federal City Council Web site.]</ref> a private civic organization which had been promoting the construction of a $200 million international trade center in the District of Columbia, advocated construction of its proposed building at Federal Triangle.<ref>Mintz, John. "New Sites Eyed In District for Trade Center." ''Washington Post.'' May 23, 1986.</ref> [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] officials favored the plan, and in October 1986 the proposal received the backing of the General Services Administration.<ref>Havemann, Judith. "Trade Center Draws Support." ''Washington Post.'' October 30, 1986.</ref> The idea received support from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in Congress as well, especially from Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], a former Kennedy administration aide who had long championed completion of the Federal Triangle.<ref>Havemann, Judith. "JFK Planted Seeds After Inaugural." ''Washington Post.'' August 8, 1987.</ref> There was some opposition to the idea from planning officials and others, who were dismayed at the loss of parking in the downtown area and who feared that the trade center's proposed 1,300 to 2,600 underground parking slots would not be built due to poor soil conditions.<ref>"It May Be Ugly, But at Least It's a Parking Lot." ''Washington Post.'' August 16, 1987.</ref> A bill was passed (almost unanimously) by Congress on August 7, 1987, to provide $362 million for the construction of an "International Cultural and Trade Center" on the parking lot at Federal Triangle.<ref name="TriangleVoted">Havemann, Judith. "Completion of Federal Triangle Voted." ''Washington Post.'' August 8, 1987.</ref> The plan was to provide office space for both the Justice and [[United States Department of State|State]] departments.<ref name="TriangleVoted" /> The legislation also provide that although the U.S. government would finance the building, a private developer would finance the structure.<ref name="TriangleVoted" /> The federal government would lease space from the private developer for 30 years, after which ownership of the building would revert to the government.<ref name="TriangleVoted" /><ref name="McPherson" /><ref>Crenshaw, Albert B. "Funding Plan Is Unusual For Government Building." ''Washington Post.'' January 17, 1990.</ref> The bill also required the building to be financially self-supporting within two years of its completion.<ref name="Ballooning" /> The rental prices throughout the lease's term would remain stable.<ref name="McPherson" /> It was only the fifth time the government had signed a "lease-to-own" agreement.<ref name="TriangleVoted" /> With 1.4 millon square feet (130,200 square metres) of office space and 500,000 square feet (46,500 square metres) of space for trade center activities, the planned trade center would be larger than any other federally owned building except for the [[The Pentagon]].<ref name="TriangleVoted" /> The bill also required that the trade center be "designed in harmony with historical and government buildings in the vicinity, ... reflect the symbolic importance and historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Nation's Capital, and ... represent the dignity and stability of the Federal Government."<ref name="McPherson">McPherson, Harry. "A Winner On the Avenue." ''Washington Post.'' August 21, 1987.</ref> A nine-member panel was established to approve any plans, and included the Secretaries of State, [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Agriculture]], and Commerce; the [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|Mayor of the District of Columbia]]; and five members of the public.<ref name="FiveNamed">"Five Named to Panel On Cultural Center." ''Washington Post.'' April 7, 1988.</ref> The building was expected to be completed in 1992.<ref name="TriangleVoted" /> President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the ''Federal Triangle Development Act'' into law on August 22, 1987.<ref>"President Signs Federal Triangle Expansion Act." ''Washington Post.'' August 23, 1987.</ref>

[[File:Ronald Reagan Bld.jpg|thumb|left|The 14th Street NW facade of the Ronald Reagan Building in 2006.]]
Preliminary design specifications required that the final building be no taller than the existing Federal Triangle structures, be constructed of similar materials, emphasize pedestrian traffic, and have a "sympathetic" architectural style.<ref name="Energizing">Forgey, Benjamin. "Energizing the Great Plaza." ''Washington Post.'' April 18, 1987.</ref> An architectural model by the firms of [[Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc|Notter Finegold & Alexander]], Mariani & Associates, and Bryant & Bryant depicted a building with a long, uninterrupted facade along 14th Street NW and two colonnaded hemicycles on the east side (matching the Post Office Department building's hemicycle).<ref name="Energizing" /> The preliminary design specs were criticized for not more clearly specifying the architectural style,<ref name="Energizing" /> for bringing another 10,000 new workers to Federal Triangle each day, and for reducing the require number of parking spaces by 30 percent to just 1,300.<ref>Hilzenrath, David S. "Huge Office Plan Draws Criticism." ''Washington Post.'' April 16, 1988.</ref> The five public members of the design committee were named on April 6, 1988, and were former Senator [[Charles H. Percy]], chair; [[Harry McPherson]], president of the Federal City Council; Donald A. Brown, chair of the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force; Michael R. Garder, a member of the [[Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation]]; and Judah C. Sommer, a local attorney.<ref name="FiveNamed" /> Groundbreaking on the now-$350 million building was scheduled for 1989, and completion in 1993.<ref name="FiveNamed" /> Disagreements broke out in mid-1988 over which federal agencies should take up residence in the structure, and whether they should be trade- or foreign-policy related.<ref>Hilzenrath, David S.

"Competing to Complete the Triangle." ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1989.</ref> Each design incorporated a new home for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] (a [[Smithsonian Institution]] entity), an outdoor memorial to President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and exhibition and retail space.<ref name="CompetingComplete" />

Construction began in mid-1989. Contractors estimated the cost of the building at between $550 million and $800 million, far higher than the anticipated $350 million original price tag.<ref>Hilzenrath, David S. "Bidding for a Federal Triangle Bonanza." ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1989.</ref> The design committee picked the $738.3 million design submitted by [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] in October 1989.<ref name="Ballooning" /><ref>Wheeler, Linda. "Federal Triangle Developer Picked." ''Washington Post.''

''Washington Post.'' March 3, 1990.</ref>

Significant cost increases led to the project being mothballed by the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year.<ref name="Ballooning">Hilzenrath, David S. "Ballooning Costs Delay Federal Triangle Project." ''Washington Post.'' July 20, 1990.</ref> Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead.<ref name="Ballooning" /> In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from the cost of the building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million.<ref name="Flourish">Hilzenrath, David S.

September 22, 1990.</ref> Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government.<ref name="Flourish" /> Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces.<ref>Camp, Margaret. "Parking Push Comes To Shove." ''Washington Post.'' January 10, 1991.</ref> But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A.

==Critical assessment==
"Federal Triangle was the most important government construction project of the 1930s in Washington."<ref>Goode, "Introduction: The Creation of Monumental Washington in the 1930s," in ''Washington by Night: Vintage Photographs From the 30s,'' 1998, p. 13.</ref> It was the largest construction project in the United States in the 1930s; only the construction of [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] came close.<ref name="Wentzel" /> It "remains one of the most important design and construction projects" in American history.<ref>Goode, "Introduction: The Creation of Monumental Washington in the 1930s," in ''Washington by Night: Vintage Photographs From the 30s,'' 1998, p. 14.</ref>

The original seven buildings won critical praise for their beauty from the news media when they first opened. The ''Washington Post'' said the Internal Revenue building was "a credit to any city" and declared the "marble work to be among the most beautiful in the United States."<ref name="NewEdifice" /> At its dedication, the ''New York Times'' called the Department of Justice building "one of the most beautiful public buildings in the world".<ref name="Ceremonies" /> But praise was most heavily lavished on the Commerce building. It was not only the largest office building in the world, but the "greatest of office buildings" and one which represented the aspirations of the nation.<ref>McDonnell, J. Bernard. "Department of Commerce Home Greatest of Office Buildings." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1931.</ref> It had "dignity without severity", one report said, and was "a magnificent architectural end".<ref>"Commerce Home Marked By Dignity." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1931.</ref> It had the "world's most extensive and impressive applications of bronze", "embellished with a wealth of detail, delicately modeled, carefully tooled, finely chased and exactingly finished."<ref>"Beautiful Bronze Work Ornaments in Structure." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1931.</ref> Even the interior decorating scheme was highly noted for its "fine architectural effect".<ref>"Colorful Painting Is Used in Building." ''Washington Post.'' December 31, 1931.</ref>

But younger architects in the 1930s criticized the style and size of the buildings at Federal Triangle for being "elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic".<ref>Cannadine, ''Mellon: An American Life,'' 2008, p. 399.</ref> Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic:  "New Deal indeed! What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks it looks pretty much like a relic out of the dim past."<ref>Hale, William Harlan. "The New Deal in Limestone." ''Washington Post.'' November 26, 1933.</ref> By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of [[Nazi architecture|Nazi]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Soviet]] architecture.<ref name="Cannadine" />

Initial assessments of the Ronald Reagan Building's design were overwhelmingly positive.  ''Washington Post'' critic Benjamin Forgey highly praised the Pei Cobb Freed design when it was first made public.<ref name="CompetingComplete" /> Forgey found the final building even more praiseworthy, finding it full of "character and extraordinary potential," "brilliant," "vital," "welcoming," "clever" and "dynamic."<ref name="Capstone" /> Forgey particularly praised the bold stroke of the building's diagonal structure (which extends from the rotunda at the north end of Woodrow Wilson Plaza to the juncture of 13th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW) and the conical atrium on the building's east side.<ref name="Capstone" /> Federal employees working in the building gave it "rave reviews" and at its dedication was one of the most sought-after places to work in the city.<ref name="Nostalgia" /> But six months later, another ''Washington Post'' reporter declared the Ronald Reagan building "much too large," "confusing" to get around in, "awkwardly configured," and with "dismal views".<ref name="Dismal">Lewis, Roger K. "Report Card on Area's Architecture: Only MCI Center Gets the Top Grade." ''Washington Post.''
