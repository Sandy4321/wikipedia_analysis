'''Mount Carmel High School''' is an all boys, Catholic high school in the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]], the school is operated by the [[Carmelite]] order of priests and brothers, some of whom live in the nearby Saint Cyril Priory. These Carmelites are assisted by lay faculty.

Mount Carmel is probably best known for its athletics program which includes one of the historically best football teams in the state of Illinois.  Nine alumni have gone on to careers in the [[National Football League]], and three former head football coaches went on to notable college head coaching careers.

Mount Carmel is occasionally confused with [[Carmel High School (Mundelein, Illinois)|Carmel High School]] in [[Mundelein, Illinois]], and [[Mount Carmel High School (Mount Carmel, Illinois)|Mount Carmel High School]] in [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]].  The former is also a Carmelite school, while the latter is the town of Mount Carmel's only public high school.

==History==
In the Fall of 1900, the Carmelite order established St. Cyril College at 54th and Jefferson (now Harper) on Chicago's South side.<ref>{{cite news | title = DEDICATE A CATHOLIC SCHOOL: Carmelite Fathers Open St. Cyril's College, Bishop Muldoon Making the Address| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune| pages = 14| date = 11 August 1902| quote = The institution was founded two years ago ... A building on Jefferson avenue was first used ...}}</ref>  In the first year there were 13 students and five priest teachers.  The following year the college was moved to 64th and Washington (now Blackstone) because of the need for a larger building and better access to public transportation.  The St. Cyril College Building at 64th and Star (now Dante) was completed in 1902, and classes began with 137 students and 11 faculty members.<ref>{{cite news | title = St. Cyril's College Building| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune| pages = 38| date = 11 August 1901| quote = St. Cyril's College ... is to be built at 6413 Starr avenue ... The work of excavation is now in progress.}}</ref>  The school was [[Consecration#Roman Catholic Church|consecrated]] by [[Peter Muldoon|Bishop Peter Muldoon]] on 10 August 1902;  a delay caused by the death of [[Patrick Feehan|Archbishop Patrick Feehan]].<ref>{{cite news | title = St. Cyril's to be dedicated: Catholic College will be formally consecrated on Sunday, Aug. 10, Bishop Muldoon officiating| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune| pages = 13| date = 8 August 1902| quote = The dedication of St. Cyril's college ... which was postponed on account of the death of Archbishop Feehan ...}}</ref>

At first the college had three departments: (1) Academic, which included both a junior high and a high school program; (2) College, a four-year program with emphasis on Greek and Latin; (3) Commercial, a three-year course.

In September 1910, the school hosted [[Vincenzo Vannutelli|Vincenzo Cardinal Vannutelli]] for lunch during a tour of Chicago Catholic schools; about ten years before becoming [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite news | title = CARDINAL SEES U.S. WONDERS - Vannutelli Says Boasts of Americans Not Exaggerated: PRAISES CHICAGO SCHOOLS| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune| pages = 5| date = 27 September 1910| quote = (The Cardinal and his) party took luncheon at St. Cyril's college, Starr avenue and East Sixty-fourth street}}</ref>

In 1918, with young men being called to serve in World War I, the college curriculum was dropped while the high school department was enlarged and improved.
[[Image:Stand up and cheer 1924.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Dedication - 1924]]
In December 1922, Father Elias Magennis, General of the Carmelite Order, and Archbishop Mundelein of Chicago agreed on the need for the immediate construction of a new St. Cyril High School Building. In the spring and summer of 1924, a three story main building was erected by the Thompson-Starrett Construction Company with [[Zachary Taylor Davis|Zachary Davis]] as the architect.<ref>{{cite news | title = St. Cyril's Carmelite School| newspaper = Chicago Daily Tribune| pages = A12| date = 12 August 1923| quote = Architect Zachary T. Davis has drawn plans for St. Cyril's Carmelite school, to be erected on the north side of 64th street, between Dante and Blackstone avenues ... work will start next month and the building will be completed in time for the opening of school in 1924.}}</ref>  William Lynch, a St. Cyril College graduate, was in charge of construction. Later that fall, the new building was dedicated as Mount Carmel High School.

During [[World War II]], Mt. Carmel began offering aeronautics classes ([[aerodynamics]] fundamentals, [[meteorology]], navigation, and civil air regulations) to students, as possible preparation for wartime employment or military service.<ref>{{cite news | title = AVIATION COURSE ON CURRICULUM OF MT. CARMEL: Study Recommended by Air Corps| newspaper = Chicago DAily Tribune| pages = s3| date = 9 August 1942}}</ref> 

The 1960s and 1970s, economic and sociological factors changed the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn neoghborhood]] (fewer Catholics were living in the immediate area).  Improved bus routes to the school permitted students to more easily reach the school, despite living further away.<ref>{{cite news | last = Colander| first = Patricia| title = Commuters solve problems at Mt. Carmel| newspaper = Chicago Tribune| pages = 35| date = 12 May 1974| quote = Mt. Carmel ... in recent years the community which supported the school has changed from white and Catholic to black and Protestant ... The practice of busing students into the city ... is a key factor in Mt. Carmel's fight for survival.}}</ref>

Mount Carmel's close proximity to the [[Black P. Stones]]/El Rukn street gang may have also hurt the school's ability to attract students. But thanks to the efforts of Father David Dillon and numerous other Mount Carmel faithful, the school survived by bussing in students from neighboring areas- many of whom are carrying on family legacies. Current redevelopment projects in the Woodlawn area and southern expansion by the [[University of Chicago]] have improved the future outlook of the school and its surrounding community.

==Campus==
The Mount Carmel campus is located at the intersection of East 64th Street and South Dante Avenue, less than a mile from [[Lake Michigan]]. The oldest surviving structures are the three-story main building and the Carmelite Chapel.

In the 1950s and 60s, Mt. Carmel saw the addition of two buildings: the Student Center and the two-story Learning Center. In 1968, a grant through the Archdiocese of Chicago's "Project: Renew" permitted the construction of a library and further construction that connected the classroom building and student center.<ref>{{cite news | title = Mt. Carmel High Gets Grant| newspaper = Chicago Tribune| pages = a6| date = 9 July 1968 }}</ref>

In 1971, plans for adding new athletic facilities were halted after a local Carmelite priest publicly accused the school of "playing into the hands of racist real estate interests on the South Side", and that he school should instead  construct low and middle income housing on the Carmelite owned land.<ref>{{cite news | title = Mt. Carmel Is Aiding Racists, Says White Carmelite Priest| newspaper = Chicago Tribune| pages = a10| date = 12 October 1971| quote = A white Catholic priest ... accused his religious order of 'playing into the hands of racist real estate interests on the South Side' ... He said the move will deprive the slum-ridden community of needed housing, and suggested the order ... build low and moderate income housing ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Mt. Carmel Shelves Plan for New Field| newspaper = Chicago Tribune| pages = d7| date = 13 October 1971| quote = Reacting to sharp criticism from residents and one of its priests, the Carmelite Order yesterday shelved at least temporarily plans to expand an athletic field in Woodlawn, and vowed to push for low and moderate income housing ...}}</ref>

Since then, the campus has gradually been enlarged, beginning with the student parking lot and the athletic field on the south end of the property. Thanks to the Capital Campaign Case Study, the campus was further expanded to include the Scott School property. In 1992, construction began on a new monastery for the Carmelites. Additionally, a science and computer center called the Graham Center was built on the site of the old Carmelite Monastery. Although the old Priory was demolished to make room for the Graham center, the original Chapel was saved and given a facelift. 

The school again expanded in 2005 by adding the Mt. Carmel Convocation Center.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}. The structure houses three gyms, an indoor track, weight room, offices, locker rooms, meeting areas for alumni and faculty, a student center/dining hall, and new computer and science labs. A new student parking lot was built on the north end of the campus.

In addition to the Convocation Center, Mt. Carmel's athletic facilities include Carey Field for football and Haggerty Field for baseball and soccer. The 'Old Gym' still hosts athletic competition, including the school's annual Fight Night boxing event. The original four-lane, 20 yard pool hosts the Swimming and Water Polo teams. Off-campus facilities used by the school include the [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] trails and practice fields, Gately Stadium, Eckersall Stadium, and the Homewood-Flossmoor ice arena.

==Academics==
Academic excellence is the trademark of Mt. Carmel High School. Once recognized as a Blue Ribbon <ref>[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf Blue Ribbon Schools 1982-2002.]</ref> and National Exemplary School, Mount Carmel offers a comprehensive and competitive curriculum. With four programs of study, the school serves the needs of all types of college bound students: 

'''The Honors/Advanced Placement Program'''
The Honors Program challenges students to maximize their potential by placing them in accelerated courses, and enriches their experience through Advanced Placement courses in Literature, American, European and World History, Physics, Calculus and Foreign Languages. 

'''Accelerated College Prep Program'''

'''McDermott-Doyle Program'''
The McDermott-Doyle program meets the needs of young men with specific learning disabilities who seek a college education but require accommodations to achieve their goals.  There a limited number of seats in this program, with preference given to students who are Catholic or graduates of Catholic grammar schools.

==Athletics==
Mount Carmel competes in the [[Chicago Catholic League]] (CCL), and was one of the eight founding members of the league in 1912 (and one of five remaining charter members.<ref>{{cite news | title = CATHOLICS TO FORM LEAGUE :Eight "Prep" Schools Will Enter New Football Body. DRAFT SCHEDULE TONIGHT| newspaper = Chicago Tribune| pages = 10| date = 3 October 1912}}</ref>  Mount Carmel is a member of the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA).
