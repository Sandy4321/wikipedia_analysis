The '''First Battle of Auburn''' was fought on [[October 13]], [[1863]], between [[Union Army|Union]] infantry and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry forces in the [[American Civil War]].  Union infantry column accidentally stumbled upon a small Confederate cavalry reconnaissance party and a small, inconclusive fight ensued.  The Confederate Cavalry withdrew in the face of the superior Union force.  A much larger body of Confederate Cavalry under [[General]] [[J.E.B. Stuart]], attempting to raid a Union wagon train became entrapped by the column, forcing them to abandoned the raid and hide in a ravine over night awaiting Confederate Infantry to come to their aid.

==Background==
Following the conclusion of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] the [[Confederate army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and [[Union army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]] reestablished their familiar dispositions astride opposite banks of the [[Rapidan River]].  For the duration of the summer both armies remained inactive, reorganizing and resupplying after the devastation wrought at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]].  In early September, [[Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]] was dispatched with two divisions to aide the Confederate war effort in the west.  After the Confederate victory at [[Battle of Chickamauga]], which Longstreet helped secure, [[Major General]] [[George Meade]] was forced to send the XI and XII Corps to secure midle [[Tennessee]].  When Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] learned of the learned of the reassignment of the two Union Corps he decided to go on the offensive and force the Army of the Potomac to give battle on ground of his choosing.

Lee's plan was much the same as that of the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]] the year prior: turn the Union right flank by threatening Washington by a forced march to the west around the Union line.  To that end Lt. Gen. [[Richard Ewell]]'s and Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]'s Corps were ordered to sweep around the Union right flank, Maj. Gen. [[Fitzugh Lee]] with three brigades of cavalry and infantry each was to secure the Rapidan prevent a Union advance and Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]] was to lead the cavalry in advance of the infantry.  The Confederate advance began on October 8th and was almost immediately detected by Union spies and the signaling station atop [[Cedar Mountain]].  Unsure of whether Lee was attempting to turn his right flank or make a retrograde movement towards [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Meade ordered dispositions to counter either threat.

The offensive began on the 10th when Staurt lead a diversionary attack on Brig. Gen. [[George Custer]]'s division holding the [[Robinson River]] west of [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper Courthouse]].  This movement convinced Meade that Lee did not intend fall back towards Richmond, and Meade fell back on Rappahannock Station.  On the 12th Confederate infantry was spotted at [[Amissville, Virginia|Amissville]], convincing Meade that Lee planned to send his army through [[Thoroughfare Gap]] as he had in 1862, accordingly, Meade retreated to [[Centreville, Virginia|Centreville]] to defend Washington from such a movement.  Lee, however, intended to converge on [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]] and stay to the south of the [[Bull Run Mountains]].  On the 13th, Stuart was dispatched to reconnoiter the position of the Union left flank as it fell back on Centreville.

==Battle==
At 10a.m. on the 12th Staurt send Brig. Gen. [[Lunsford L. Lomax]]'s brigade east from Warrenton, Starut followed an hour later with two divisions.  Lomax stopped at Auburn to wait for Stuart and dispatched scouts further east who soon discovered Brig. Gen.  [[John Buford]]'s cavalry at Warrenton Junction, guarding the Federal wagon train advancing east by the Alexandria and Orange railroad.  No scouts were dispatched to the south however, and the presence of the the Union II and III Corps, which had become separated from the main body of the Union army due to confusion during the frequent repositioning, marching north toward Auburn.

Starut arrived at Auburn around 1 p.m. and then rode east to Catlett's Station to reconnoiter the Union wagon train, leaving Lomax to hold Auburn and dispatching his aide, Capt. [[William B. Blackford]] to scout to the south of Auburn, Blackford, unfortunately got lost and failed to discover the approaching Federal column.  Stuart, meanwhile, impressed by the size of the wagon train sent a dispatch to [[Fitz Lee]] at Warrenton, ordering him to aid in the attack.  Lee left Warrenton at 4 p.m. and followed Staurt's path through Auburn.

The Union column led by Maj. Gen. [[William H. French]]'s III Corps, followed by Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]]'s II Corps, approached Auburn about 4:15 p.m.  French had dispatched his cavalry under Brig. Gen. [[H. Judson Kilpatrick]] to the north to guard his left flank from Confederate cavalry at Warrenton, leaving the column without the cavalry at its head, thus allowing it to stumble right into the Confederates at Auburn.  French and his staff, at the head of the Column, fired their revolvers at the Confederates as the infantry and artillery was brought up.  Lomax attempted to charge the Federal line but a volley of canister shot drove back the assault.  By 4:45 the fighting died down, just as Lee arrived from Warrenton.  Seeing they were facing two infantry Corps, Lee and Lomax withdrew to Warrenton.  

==Results==
The short fight resulted in only about 50 casualties, but had deep repercussions for Stuart and the developing campaign.  Blackford, finally, alerted to the presence of the Federals, alerted Stuart of the situation.  Seeing that he was trapped between the II and III Corps to his northwest and the wagon train to the southeast, Stuart led his divisions, some 3,000 men horses, five ordinance wagons and seven artillery pieces into a wooded ravine east of Auburn, only {{convert|300|yd|m}} from Warren's bivouac.  After dark, Stuart sent half a dozen scouts dressed in Federal uniforms through the Union lines to get word to Robert E. Lee.  Lee accordingly dispatched Ewell to Auburn at dawn to rescue Stuart and his cavalry setting up the [[Battle of Auburn II|Second Battle of Auburn]] the following day.
