Once there, she meets Paul, the gorgeous American photographer who grabs her before she falls into the famous [[Trevi Fountain]]. Sabrina finds an unexpected roommate: Gwen, a British witch with a talking guinea pig named Stonehenge (nicknamed "Stony"). Together, Sabrina and Gwen set out to solve the mystery of the locket.
