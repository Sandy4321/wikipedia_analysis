'''Digital Multimedia Broadcasting''' ('''DMB''') is a digital [[radio transmission]] [[technology]] developed in [[South Korea]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.co.kr/ArticleView.asp?artice_id=00000039146251 |title=Korea's Terrestrial DMB: Germany to begin broadcast this May |publisher=ZDNet Korea |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/cat_dmb.htm |title=picturephoning.com: DMB |publisher=Textually.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reportworld.co.kr/cbqna/cb_answer_view.html?no=40590 |title=South Korea : Social Media <U+B2F5><U+BCC0> <U+B0B4><U+C6A9> : <U+C545><U+C5B4><U+C0C8> - <U+B9AC><U+D3EC><U+D2B8><U+C6D4><U+B4DC> |publisher=Reportworld.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> as part of the national [[information technology|IT]] project for sending multimedia such as [[TV]], [[radio]] and [[datacasting]] to [[mobile device]]s such as mobile phones, laptops and GPS navigation systems. This [[technology]], sometimes known as [[mobile TV]], should not be confused with [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] which was developed as a research project for the [[European Union]]. DMB was developed in South Korea as the next generation digital technology to replace FM radio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ericemoon.googlepages.com/IntroductionofDMBinKorea.pdf |title=The Introduction of DMB in Korea |publisher=Ericemoon.googlepages.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> but the technological foundations were laid by Prof. Dr. Gert Siegle and Dr. Hamed Amor at Robert Bosch GmbH in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutscher-zukunftspreis.de/nominierter/sichere-bewegtbild<U+00FC>bertragung-zum-mobilen-teilnehmer?sec=0 |title=Sichere Bewegtbild<U+00FC>bertragung zum mobilen Teilnehmer |publisher=deutscher-zukunftspreis.de |date=1998}}</ref> The world's first official mobile TV service started in South Korea in May 2005, although trials were available much earlier. It can operate via [[communications satellite|satellite]] ('''S-DMB''') or terrestrial ('''T-DMB''') transmission. DMB has also some similarities with the main competing mobile TV standard, [[DVB-H]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.t-dmb.org/ |title=T-DMB |publisher=Eng.t-dmb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

{{main|S-DMB}}

== T-DMB ==

T-DMB is made for terrestrial transmissions on band III ([[VHF]]) and [[L band|L]] ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) frequencies. DMB is unavailable in the United States because those frequencies are [[frequency allocation|allocated]] for television broadcasting (VHF channels 7 to 13) and military applications. USA is adopting [[ATSC-M/H]] for free broadcasts to mobiles, and [[Qualcomm]]'s proprietary [[MediaFLO]] system was used there. In Japan, [[1seg]] is the standard, using [[ISDB]].

T-DMB uses [[MPEG-4 Part 10]] ([[H.264]]) for the video and [[MPEG-4 Part 3]] BSAC or [[HE-AAC v2]] for the audio. The audio and video is encapsulated in an [[MPEG transport stream]] (MPEG-TS). The stream is forward error corrected by [[Reed Solomon]] encoding and the parity word is 16 bytes long. There is [[convolution]]al [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaving]] made on this stream, then the stream is broadcast in data stream mode on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]]. In order to diminish the channel effects such as fading and shadowing, the DMB modem uses [[OFDM]]-[[DQPSK]] modulation. A single-[[computer chip|chip]] T-DMB receiver is also provided by an [[MPEG transport stream]] [[demultiplexer]]. DMB has several applicable devices such as mobile phone, portable TV, PDA and [[telematics]] devices for automobiles.

T-DMB is an [ETSI] standard (TS 102 427 and TS 102 428). As of December 14, 2007, [[ITU]] formally approved T-DMB as the global standard, along with three other standards, like DVB-H, OneSeg, and MediaFLO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2007/12/123_15630.html |title=ITU approves Mobile TV Standards |publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

== Smart DMB ==

Smart DMB started in January 2013 in South Korea. Smart DMB has a VOD service and quality has been improved from 240p to 480p. Smart DMB will be built in in many Korean smartphones starting with the Galaxy Grand in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smart DMB starting with Samsung Phones|url=http://news.inews24.com/php/news_view.php?g_serial=718750&g_menu=020320&rrf=nv|publisher=<U+C544><U+C774><U+B274><U+C2A4>24 (iNews 24)}} Retrieved 2013-01-20 </ref>

== Countries using DMB ==
 
Currently, DMB is being put into use in a number of countries, although mainly used in South Korea. Also see list of [[Countries using DAB/DMB]].

=== South Korea ===

In 2005, [[South Korea]] became the world's first country to start S-DMB and T-DMB service on May 1 and December 1, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=23866 |title=AsiaMedia :: KOREA: Cell phone-based broadcasting starts |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=34172 |title=AsiaMedia :: KOREA: KBS to start terrestrial mobile television services next month |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2005-11-22 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> {{As of|2006|alt=As of December 2006}}, T-DMB service in South Korea consists of, 7 TV channels, 12 radio channels, and 8 data channels. These are broadcast on six [[multiplexing|multiplex]]es in the VHF band on TV channels 8 and 12 (6&nbsp;MHz raster). In October 2007, South Korea added broadcasting channel MBCNET to the DMB channel. But in 2010, this channel changed tnN go. In 2009 there were eight DMB video channels in Seoul, and six in other metropolitan cities.

South Korea has had Full T-DMB services including JSS ([[Jpeg Slide Show]]), DLS ([[Dynamic Label Segment]]), [[Broadcast Website|BWS]], and [[TPEG]] since 2006.

As of April 2007, S-DMB service in South Korea consists of 15 TV channels and 19 radio channels and 3 data channels.
S-DMB service in South Korea is provided on a [[subscription]] basis through [[TU Media]] and is accessible throughout the country. T-DMB service is provided free of charge, but access is limited to selected regions.

Around one million receivers have been sold {{As of|2006|alt=as of June 2006}}. 14 million DMB receivers were sold including T-DMB and S-DMB in South Korea, and 40% of the new cell phones have the capability to see DMB.<ref>[http://news.mk.co.kr/outside/view.php?year=2008&no=500183 DMB users shout in the metro coming home], [[Daily economics]]</ref>

Receivers are integrated in car [[navigation system]]s, mobile phones, [[portable media player]]s, laptop computers and digital cameras. In Mid August 2007, [[Iriver]], a multimedia and micro-technology company released their "NV", which utilizes South Korea's DMB service.

=== Other countries ===

Some T-DMB [[evaluation|trial]]s are currently available or planned around [[Europe]] and other countries:

* In [[Norway]] T-DMB services have been available since May 2009. MiniTV DMB service launched by the [[Norwegian Mobile TV Corporation]] (NMTV) is backed by the three largest broadcasters in Norway: the public broadcaster [[NRK]], [[TV2 (Norway)|TV2]] and [[Modern Times Group]] (MTG). The live channels can be viewed in and around Greater Oslo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18236 |title=Norway launches mobile TV via DMB |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>
* [[Germany]]'s Mobiles Fernsehen Deutschland (MFD) launched the commercial T-DMB service "Watcha" in June 2006, in time for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]], marketed together with [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]'s P900 DMB Phone, the first DMB Phone in Europe. It was stopped in April 2008 as MFD is now favouring DVB-H, the European standard.<ref>Broadband TV news: [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=4682 MFD hands back German T-DMB licence], May 1, 2008</ref>
* [[France]] on December 2007 chose T-DMB Audio in VHF band III and L band as the national standard for terrestrial digital radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddab.org/country_information/france |title=Country Information for DAB, DAB+ and DMB -France (WorldDMB) |publisher=Worlddab.org |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

* In [[Mexico]] most cell phone carriers offer DMB broadcasting as part of their basic plans. As of 2008 the vast majority of Mexico receives  DMB signals.
* [[Ghana]] is running a T-DMB service in [[Accra]] and [[Kumasi]] on mobile network since May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddab.org/country_information/ghana |title=Country Information for DAB, DAB+ and DMB -Ghana (WorldDMB) |publisher=Worlddab.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>
* [[Netherlands]]: MFD, [[T-Systems]] and private investors are planning a DMB service under the name Mobiel TV Nederland. Callmax will also deploy a DMB service on the L-Band frequency in the Netherlands.<ref>Emerce [http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws.jsp?id=2867056 Digitale omroep gaat concurrentie aan met KPN MobielTV], Februari 12, 2009</ref>
* [[Indonesia]] is currently running a trial in [[Jakarta]].
* [[Italy]] and [[Vatican City]]: [[RAI]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raiway.rai.it/index.php?lang=IT&cat=73&showNE=57&PHPSESSID=014e6bb9 |title=RAIWay |publisher=RAIWay |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> and [[Vatican Radio]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Webteam |url=http://www.radiovaticana.org/sv1/web_tv.asp |title= Web TV and T-DMB programmes |publisher=Vatican Radio |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> are currently running a trial some areas.
* [[Canada]] has been running trials since 2006 in Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, done by [[CBC/Radio-Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/2007/08/27/|title=CBC/Radio-Canada Conducts Field Trials with Mobile Broadcast Multimedia}}</ref>
* [[Malaysia]] has been running trials since 2008 in KL, done by [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]]/[[Media Prima|MPB]]. Initially, the government was committed to deploying [[DVB-T]] for government-owned channels, however as of December 2009, RTM1 and 2, as well as all the radio channels, are available over Band III for DMB-T as in addition to DVB-T. Additionally, the TV3 DMB signal has moved to L Band. The TV3 DMB signals are still limited to the Damansara and Kuala Lumpur area, while the government owned DMB-T signals have a wider coverage and apparently covers most of the Klang Valley area. The government transmissions are part of a two-year trial that is part of a test that also involves the DAB and DAB+ digital radio standard.
* [[Cambodia]] on August 2010 chose T-DMB as the national standard for terrsetrial digital broadcasting. [[National Television of Cambodia|TVK]] is currently running a trial.<ref>http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=001&oid=001&aid=0004620658</ref>

== DMB in automobiles ==
{{See also|Software-defined radio|Car audio}}

T-DMB works flawlessly in vehicles traveling up to 120&nbsp;km/h.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In tunnels or underground areas, both TV and Radio broadcast is still available, though DMB may skip occasionally. Fortunately, the broadcast recovers quickly. In South Korea, some long distance buses adopted T-DMB instead of satellite TV such as Sky TV. It works quite well even though the resolution is lower than satellite at 240p. In comparison, satellite is usually 480p or higher.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
