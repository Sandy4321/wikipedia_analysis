==Career==
[[File:Cut of Al Roker, 2009-01-20.jpg|thumb|right|Roker outside the Pentagon.]]
Before the national recognition, Roker worked as a weather anchor for the [[CBS]] affliate [[WTVH]] based in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York]] in 1974<U+2013>1976,  for [[Washington, D.C.]]'s Metromedia affiliate [[WTTG]] in 1976<U+2013>1978, and for the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] area NBC affiliate [[WKYC-TV]] in 1978<U+2013>1983. He was also the weather anchor for [[WNBC]] in [[New York City]] for several years starting in 1983.

In 1995, he became the host of ''The Al Roker Show'', a weekend talk show on [[CNBC]]. In 1996<U+2013>1997, he hosted a game show on [[MSNBC]] called ''[[Remember This?]]''.

Roker started getting more exposure, especially when [[David Letterman]] asked him to do an elevator race with him in one episode of his [[talk show]] ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', which taped across the hall from WNBC's news studio in the [[GE Building]]. That led Roker to getting a job as the forecaster for ''[[Weekend Today]]'', where he did the weather for nine years. He also substituted on the weekday edition of Today when [[Willard Scott]] was ill or away. In 1996, Scott announced his semi-retirement from the show, and Roker received the weekday weather position on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', where he has been since. He officially joined ''Today'' on [[January 26]], 1996. Roker became popular for doing his forecasts outside of the studio, interviewing audience members and giving some of them camera time. Roker also began doing more interviews and segments on the show as time progressed.

In 2005, Roker reported from inside [[Hurricane Wilma]]. A popular [[viral video]] exists on the internet of Roker being swept off his feet by the force of the hurricane and holding on to his cameraman.

Roker is a game show fan, and hosted a week-long segment on ''Today'' in honor of five game shows and their hosts. He also appeared as a celebrity player on both ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. In 2008, Roker hosted NBC's ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]].''<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/Celebrity_Family_Feud/ Celebrity Family Feud | Watch Episodes Online for Free - Family Feud, All American Summer & Game Shows | Celebrity Family Feud - NBC Official Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2008/04/al-roker-to-hos.html Orlando Sentinel - Al Roker to host "Celebrity Family Feud" by Hal Boedeker<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Roker also replaced [[Meredith Vieira]] for a week of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' shows on March 5-9, 2007.

Roker also hosts various programs on [[The Food Network]], namely, ''Roker on the Road'', and, ''Tricked-Out Tailgating''. He is also the [[author]] of several [[non-fiction]] books, and an avid [[barbecue]] enthusiast. <ref>[http://www.nbc.com/Celebrity_Family_Feud/ Celebrity Family Feud | Watch Episodes Online for Free - Family Feud, All American Summer & Game Shows | Celebrity Family Feud - NBC Official Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2008/04/al-roker-to-hos.html Orlando Sentinel - Al Roker to host "Black Celebrity Family Feud" by Hal Boedeker<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Roker was also the forecaster for several radio stations, including the New York [[smooth jazz]] [[radio station]] [[WQCD]] (101.9 FM) and for Cleveland smooth jazz station [[WNWV]] (107.3 FM). The service was called the "Al Roker Radio Weather Network," it was provided by [[United Stations Radio Networks]].

==Controversy==
<!-- Please do not correct the grammar or spelling of the quotations, as they are taken directly from his blog. -->
On June 7, 2007, Roker referenced the logo for [[2012 Summer Olympics]]: <blockquote>
Remember that controversial Olympic logo for the 2012 Olympics in London? Some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into [[epileptic seizure]]s. Well, we asked you to weigh in on our website in an informal poll; those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around were able to actually log in . . .
</blockquote> The following day Roker stated, "I started joking about [the logo]. I want to make this clear&nbsp;<U+2014> I was not joking about epilepsy or anyone who suffers from epilepsy. We understand and know that this is a serious affliction and would never joke about that. We were joking about the logo&nbsp;<U+2014> not about epilepsy. If anybody was offended, I heartily and really humbly apologize."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06092007/tv/joker_roker__sorry_tv_michael_starr.htm |title=Joker Roker: 'Sorry'|}}</ref> On July 19, 2007, Roker was scheduled to appear on the ''[[Opie & Anthony]] Show'' to talk about the incident, but at the last minute Roker cancelled.<ref>[http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=442674 Al Roker Hides From Opie & Anthony Confrontation], ''FMQB'', July 19, 2007.</ref>

Roker's comment came only 2 months after blasting radio personality Don Imus and insisted Imus be removed not only from the radio airwaves but also MSNBC for Imus's own controversial comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team. On April 10, 2007 Roker writes on his MSNBC blog about Imus<U+2019>s apology: 
<blockquote>
"The <U+201C>I<U+2019>m a good person who said a bad thing<U+201D> apology doesn<U+2019>t cut it. At least he didn<U+2019>t try to weasel out of this by hiding behind alcohol or drug abuse. Still, he said it and a two-week suspension doesn<U+2019>t cut it. It is, at best, a slap on the wrist. A vacation. Nothing.<U+201D>. </blockquote>

==Signature phrases==
* In many occasions on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' he has used the phrase "man candy" to describe attractive males.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjrdaily.org/behind_the_news/al_roker_sure_loves_his_man_ca.php|title=Al Roker Sure Loves His "Man Candy"|first=Liz|last=Barrett|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=October 18, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref>
