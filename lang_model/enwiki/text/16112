'''Justus''' (occasionally '''Iustus''')<ref name=Convert94>Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 94</ref> (died on 10 November between 627 and 631) was the fourth [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He was sent from Italy to England by Pope [[Pope Gregory the Great|Gregory the Great]], on a mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons, probably arriving with the second group of missionaries despatched in 601. Justus became the first [[Bishop of Rochester]] in 604, and attended a church council in Paris in 614.

Following the death of King [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent]] in 616, Justus was forced to flee to [[Gaul]], but was reinstated in his diocese the following year. In 624 Justus became Archbishop of Canterbury, overseeing the despatch of missionaries to [[Northumbria]]. After his death he was revered as a saint, and had a shrine in [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[Canterbury]].

==Arrival in Britain==

He is flanked by two colonnades, which are filled with small scenes. Over the central figure is an arch which surmounts a winged bull.|The [[evangelist portrait]] of Luke, from the [[St. Augustine Gospels]] (c.&nbsp;6th-century), which may have accompanied Justus to Britain.]]
Justus was an Italian and a member of the [[Gregorian mission]] sent to England by Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory&nbsp;I]]. Almost everything known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]].<ref name=DNB>Hunt "Justus [St Justus] (d. 627x31)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> As Bede does not describe Justus' origins, nothing is known about him prior to his arrival in England. He probably arrived in England with the second group of missionaries, sent at the request of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in 601.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=ASE109>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 109</ref>  Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597,<ref name=Hindley65>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 65</ref> but Bede believed that Justus came in the second group.<ref name=World84>Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 84<U+2013>87</ref><ref name=Wallace43>Wallace-Hadrill ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'' p. 43</ref> The second group included [[Mellitus]], who later became [[Bishop of London]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=Mellitus>Brooks "Mellitus (d. 624)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

If Justus was a member of the second group of missionaries, then he arrived with a gift of books and "all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church".<ref name=Bede85>[[Bede]] ''A History of the English Church and People'' p. 85<U+2013>86</ref><ref name=Coming62>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 62</ref> A 15th-century Canterbury chronicler, [[Thomas of Elmham]], claimed that there were a number of books brought to England by that second group still at Canterbury in his day, although he did not identify them. An investigation of extant Canterbury manuscripts shows that one possible survivor is the [[St. Augustine Gospels]], now in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Manuscript (MS) 286.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|Another possible survivor is a copy of the ''[[Rule of St Benedict]]'', now MS Oxford [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] Hatton 48.<ref name=Colgrave27>Colgrave "Introduction" ''Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'' pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> Another Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, is MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium  D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of  MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.<ref name=Library24>Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>|group=notes}}

==Bishop of Rochester==

Augustine consecrated Justus as a bishop in 604, over a province including the [[Kingdom of Kent|Kentish]] town of [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]].<ref name=Brooks11>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 221</ref> The historian Nicholas Brooks argues that the choice of Rochester was probably not because it had been a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of [[Watling Street]] and the estuary of the [[Medway]], and was thus a fortified town.<ref name=Brooks24>Brooks "From British to English Christianity" ''Conversion and Colonization'' pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref> Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede),<ref name=Andrew291>Smith "Early Community of St. Andrew at Rochester" ''English Historical Review'' p. 291</ref> his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.<ref name=Smith292>Smith "Early Community of St. Andrew at Rochester" ''English Historical Review'' p. 292</ref>

A charter purporting to be from King <U+00C6>thelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'', as well as a copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century ''Liber Temporalium''. Written mostly in Latin but using an [[Old English]] boundary clause, the charter records a grant of land near the city of Rochester to Justus' church.<ref>Miller [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1 New Regesta Regum Anglorum: Sawyer 1]</ref><ref>Campbell ''Charters of Rochester'' p. c</ref> Among the witnesses is [[Laurence of Canterbury|Laurence]], Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, <U+00C6>thelberht is made to admonish his son [[Eadbald of Kent|Eadbald]], who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church,<ref>Morris ''Arthurian Sources'' vol. ii p. 90</ref> a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.<ref name=Levinson223>Levison ''England and the Continent'' pp. 223<U+2013>225</ref>

Historian Wilhelm Levison, writing in 1946, was sceptical about the authenticity of this charter.<ref name=Levinson223/> In particular, he felt that the two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below).<ref name=Levinson223/> A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.<ref>Morris ''Arthurian Sources'' vol. ii pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref>

<U+00C6>thelberht built Justus a cathedral church in Rochester, and the foundations of a [[nave]] and [[chancel]] partly underneath the present-day [[Rochester Cathedral]] may date from that time.<ref name=World84/> What remains of the foundations of an early rectangular building, near the southern part of the current cathedral, might also be contemporary with Justus, or may be part of a Roman building.<ref name=Brooks24/>

Together with Mellitus, the Bishop of London, Justus signed a letter written by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops, urging the [[Celtic Christianity|native church]] to adopt the Roman method of [[Computus|calculating]] the date of [[Easter]].<ref name=ASE112>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 112</ref> Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.<ref name=Convert138>Higham ''Convert Kings'' pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref>

In 614 Justus attended the Council of Paris, held by the [[Franks|Frankish]] king, [[Chlothar II]].<ref name=Wood>Wood "Mission of Augustine of Canterbury" ''Speculum''</ref> It is unclear why Justus, and [[Peter of Canterbury|Peter]], the abbot of [[St Augustine's, Canterbury|Sts Peter and Paul]] in Canterbury,{{#tag:ref|This later was renamed St. Augustine's Abbey.<ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} were present; it may have been just chance, but the historian James Campbell has suggested that Chlothar summoned clergy from Britain to attend in an attempt to assert overlordship over Kent.<ref name=Campbell56>Campbell "First Century of Christianity" ''Essays in Anglo-Saxon History'' p. 56</ref> The historian N. J. Higham offers another explanation for their attendance, arguing that <U+00C6>thelberht sent the pair to the council because of shifts in Frankish policy towards the Kentish kingdom, threatening Kentish independence, and that the two clergymen were sent to negotiate a compromise with Chlothar.<ref name=Convert116>Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 116</ref>

A pagan backlash against Christianity followed <U+00C6>thelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus to flee to [[Gaul]].<ref name=Mellitus/> The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees,<ref name=Convert138/> and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king.<ref name=DNB/> Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow him to return to London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=Mellitus>Lapidge "Mellitus" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope [[Pope Boniface V|Boniface V]] (619<U+2013>625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill]] assumes that both letters were general statements of encouragement to the missionaries.<ref name=Wallace64>Wallace-Hadrill ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref>

==Archbishop==

Justus became Archbishop of Canterbury in 624,<ref name=Handbook213/> receiving his [[pallium]]<U+2014>the symbol of the jurisdiction entrusted to archbishops<U+2014>from Pope Boniface V, following which Justus consecrated [[Romanus (Bishop of Rochester)|Romanus]] as his successor at Rochester.<ref name=DNB/> Boniface also gave Justus a letter congratulating him on the conversion of King "Aduluald" (probably King Eadbald of Kent), a letter which is included in Bede's ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]''.<ref name=Kirby31>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref> Bede's account of Eadbald's conversion states that it was Laurence, Justus' predecessor at Canterbury, who converted the King to Christianity, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the letter's reference to Eadbald makes it likely that it was Justus.<ref name=Kirby33>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 33</ref> Other historians, including [[Barbara Yorke]] and [[Henry Mayr-Harting]], conclude that Bede's account is correct, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence.<ref name=Mayr75>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> Yorke argues that there were two kings of Kent during Eadbald's reign, Eadbald and <U+00C6>thelwald, and that <U+00C6>thelwald was the "Aduluald" referred to by Boniface. Yorke argues that Justus converted <U+00C6>thelwald back to Christianity after <U+00C6>thelberht's death.<ref name=Yorke32>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 32</ref>

Justus consecrated [[Paulinus of York|Paulinus]] as the first [[Bishop of York]], before the latter accompanied [[<U+00C6>thelburg of Kent]] to [[Northumbria]] for her marriage to King [[Edwin of Northumbria]].<ref name=DNB/> Bede records Justus as having died on 10&nbsp;November, but does not give a year, although it is likely to have between 627 and 631.<ref name=Handbook213>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 213</ref><ref name=Wallace82>Wallace-Hadrill ''Bede's Ecclesiastical History'' p. 82</ref> After his death, Justus was regarded as a saint, and was given a feast day of 10&nbsp;November.<ref name=DictSaint>Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 354<U+2013>355</ref> In the 1090s his remains were [[Translation (relics)|translated]], or ritually moved, to a shrine beside the high altar of St Augustine's Abbey in [[Canterbury]]. At about the same time a ''Life'' was written about him by [[Goscelin|Goscelin of Saint-Bertin]], as well as a poem by [[Reginald of Canterbury]].<ref name=ASE>Hayward "Justus" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref>{{#tag:ref|None of these works appear to have been published or translated within the last 200 years.<ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} Other material from [[Thomas Elmham|Thomas of Elmham]], [[Gervase of Canterbury]], and [[William of Malmesbury]], later medieval chroniclers, adds little to Bede's account of Justus' life.<ref name=DNB/>
