'''Heffer Wolfe'''<ref name="Confidential">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20000412084848/nick.com/inits/safety/cow-fidential1.html Cow-fidential Information]," ''[[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]''</ref> is a [[fictional character]] on the cartoon ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and the comic book series of the same name. [[Tom Kenny]] provided the voice of the anthropomorphic [[Cattle|steer]]. His catchphrase, which can be heard in the series' opening credits, is "That was a hoot!"

==Conception and development==
[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], creator of ''Rocko's Modern Life'', partially based Heffer on an adopted friend who enjoyed [[bologna sausage|bologna]] sandwiches and "had an interesting take on life." <ref name="CharMuseum">"[http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/museum.shtml Character Museum]," ''[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] Studio''</ref> Heffer first appeared on an ID spot aired on [[MTV]] in 1989; the ID spot depicts Heffer as flying out of a television with the MTV logo branded on his [[buttocks]].<ref name="Murray">"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref><ref>"[http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=830 February 2, 2009]."

[[File:Tom Kenny in 2009.jpg|left|thumb|[[Tom Kenny]] voiced Heffer and was chosen for the role in a large casting call in [[Los Angeles]].]]
Murray originally wrote "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic" as the pilot episode; the executives decided that Heffer would be "a little too weird for test audiences." Murray, instead of removing Heffer from "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic," decided to write "[[Trash-O-Madness]]," an episode without Heffer, as the pilot episode.<ref name="Murray"/> Originally Murray did not include any information about Heffer's origins in his pitch to Nickelodeon. Vince Calandra wrote the Heffer's origin plotline in Season 1.<ref name="MaestriDigitalCharAnimation3">[[George Maestri|Maestri, George]]. ''Digital Character Animation 3''.

Murray auditioned Kenny in a large casting call in [[Los Angeles]] and chose him as the voice actor for Heffer.<ref name="Murray"/>

[[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]], a storyboard writer, says that Heffer's right eye and left nostril are "notched at the bottom" due to Murray's design style. Marsh added that the animators found keeping the sides straight "a little tricky at first" and that they referred to the design as "[[Tombstone]]-shaped." <ref>"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/interview.html Dan Abrams' interview with Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref>

==Character==
Best friend of [[Rocko]], Heffer was raised by wolves in Richhill<U+2014>as seen by his [[family name]]<U+2014>who originally were going to eat him, and thus began to fatten him. Eventually the family grew to love Heffer, so they instead raised him, not letting him know that he was adopted until Rocko accidentally revealed the truth when the Wolfe Family invited him for dinner. The mark which Heffer believed to be a "[[birthmark]]" on his buttocks is actually the plotting lines showing where the wolves were going to divide him.

The Nickelodeon UK page describes Heffer as a "devoted friend" who "loves life."<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20060917051749/nick.co.uk/nicktoons/shows/rocko/heffer.aspx Heffer]," ''Nickelodeon UK''</ref>  Heffer's lack of fear mostly stems from stupidity instead of genuine bravery.<ref name="Aus2">"[http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/toonroom/rocko/meetmain2.php Characters]" of ''Rocko's Modern Life'' Page 2, ''[[Nickelodeon Australia]]''</ref> The [[Nickelodeon South East Asia]] website describes him as an "overgrown slob."<ref name="SEAsiaProfile">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20041125013739/www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Rockos_modern_life/heffer.html Heffer]," ''[[Nickelodeon South East Asia]]''</ref> Despite being obese, he can drive; unlike Rocko he does not wear [[seat belt]]s.

Heffer holds several jobs: tree farmer, greenskeeper at a golf course, mail carrier, security guard, waiter at a caf<U+00E9>, and cashier.    Despite his size, he can be very nimble at times, most notably when he is roller-skating. At the local skating rink, he is known as "The King," and performs his own skating routine at the request of the patrons.<ref>"Wallaby on Wheels," ''Rocko's Modern Life''</ref>

Heffer's large size often has him hungry or eating. Another [[running gag]] is Heffer being called a cow, which is usually corrected by he or his father calling Heffer a '''steer'''. Heffer's name is taken from the word "[[wikt:heifer|heifer]]".

It is revealed in an episode that Heffer's biological father is still alive with a girl cow named Joyce living in a trailer in the [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California|Canoga Park]] section of the [[San Fernando Valley]] region of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]].<ref name="CharMuseum"/> However, Heffer's father seems to have very little patience for his son, even to the point of dropping the short-tempered bombshell that "your mother's a car seat in Illinois."
