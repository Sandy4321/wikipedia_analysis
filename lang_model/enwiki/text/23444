'''Villa Regina''' is a city in the {{province|R<U+00ED>o Negro|Argentina}}.

==Overview==
Situated on the upper [[R<U+00ED>o Negro (Argentina)|R<U+00ED>o Negro]] (Black River) valley, the city was established in 1924 by land prospector Juan Mi<U+00F3>n, who named the new settlement in honor of the First Lady of Argentina at the time, Regina Pacini de Alvear. Populated initially by [[Italian Argentine|Italian]] and [[Austrians|Austrian]] settlers, each of these families was deeded a [[land grant]] of 5 to 15 hectares (13 to 38 acres) and, by 1928, 5,000 ha (12,600 ac) had been allotted this way. 

Closely linked to [[General Roca, R<U+00ED>o Negro|General Roca]], the department (county) seat to Villa Regina's west, the city remains known for its [[apple]] and [[pear]] harvests, though its economy is today well-diversified into services and is home to numerous canning and bottling plants, as well. Villa Regina is connected to other cities in the orchard-rich R<U+00ED>o Negro Valley via [[National Route 22 (Argentina)|Highway 22]].
