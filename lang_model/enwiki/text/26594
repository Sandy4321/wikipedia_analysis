==History==
CCC was established under the direction of the Astoria Board of Education in 1958 and constitutes Oregon<U+2019>s first community college. The original curriculum included  two years of classes that could be transferred and two year sequences in Electronics, Business, Automotive and Building Construction. In 1962, Clatsop County residents  voted to form a county-wide education district and separate the College from the school district. Renovation of the former Astoria High School began in June 1962 and  this facility became the home of CCC.

In October 2008, the college broke ground on the Jerome Campus Redevelopment project. This project, now complete, resulted in the renovation of Towler Hall (the former Astoria High School), renovation of Patriot Hall and the construction of Columbia Hall.  .<ref name="50years">{{cite book
