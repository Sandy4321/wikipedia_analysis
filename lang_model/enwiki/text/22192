'''Jacobus Anthonie Meessen''' (5 December 1836&nbsp;<U+2013> 14 November 1885) was a Dutch photographer who took over 250&nbsp;[[Portrait photography|portraits]] and [[Landscape photography|landscapes]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) between 1864 and 1870. Born to a carpenter in [[Utrecht]], Meessen worked in that trade in the Indies before marrying in the Netherlands in the early 1860s. He returned to the colony in 1864, intent on documenting its land and people. He worked mostly in the capital of Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), [[Java]], and [[Padang]], [[Sumatra]]; he also photographed [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Belitung]], [[Borneo]], and [[Nias]].

When Meessen returned to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short-lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating his photographs. Selected images were gifted to [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III]] in an elaborately decorated album in 1871, while more were published by [[J. H. De Bussy|De Bussy]] in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam. In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect. Collections of his [[albumen print]]s, some of which were [[Hand-colouring of photographs|hand-tinted]] or annotated, are held in four institutions in the Netherlands.

==Biography==
Meessen was born in [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands, on 5&nbsp;December 1836 to the carpenter Hermanus Johannes Meessen and his wife Megteld Legu<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}{{sfn|Yayasan Untuk Indonesia|2005b|pp=6<U+2013>7}} In 1858 the younger Meessen first went to Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), the capital of the Dutch colony in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], where he worked as a carpenter.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} By 1860 he was living in the [[Purbalingga Regency|Purbalingga]] area.{{sfn|Almanak van Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1860, Naamlijst|p=90}} Two years later he returned to the Netherlands, where he served as a special inspector for the [[Rijkswaterstaat|Bureau voor den Waterstaat]].{{efn|Original: "buitengewoon opzigter van den waterstaat"}} On 11&nbsp;December 1862 he wed Johanna Alida (Jansje) Steenbeek in Utrecht, and the couple settled in that city for the next two years.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} Their marriage produced three daughters, born in 1865, 1866, and 1869;{{sfn|Utrechtsch Provinciaal en Stedel<U+0133>k Dagblad 1865, Familiebericht}}{{sfn|Java Bode 1866, Familiebericht}}{{sfn|Utrechtsch Provinciaal en Stedel<U+0133>k Dagblad 1869, Familiebericht}} the first, Antonia, died in infancy.{{sfn|Bataviaasch handelsblad 1865, Familiebericht}}

===Photography===

Meessen and his wife departed for the Indies in 1864, first arriving in Batavia, where Meessen established a photo studio in early 1867.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} He was one of the few photographers active in the Indies in the 1860s; contemporaries included [[Isidore van Kinsbergen]], Adolph Schaefer, and the commercial firm of Woodbury and Page (operated by [[Walter B. Woodbury]] and James Page). Meessen hoped to eventually take images of the Indies' various lands and people. From May to August he was in [[Sumatra]], first in [[Padang]] and later in the [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minang Highlands]]. There he offered various photographic services, including double and family portraits. When he returned to Batavia in September, he opened another studio,{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes.{{sfn|Yayasan Untuk Indonesia|2005a|p=82}}

Three months later Jacobus and Johanna sold their belongings and moved back to Padang, where the Meessens established a photography studio. In their biography of the photographer, Mattie Boom and Steven Wachlin suggest that this was likely a commercial necessity, as Meessen may have been unable to compete with the Batavia-based Woodbury and Page.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} By November 1868 Jacobus was advertising his first album, titled ''Sumatra's Westkust'' (''Sumatra's West Coast'').{{sfn|Netherlands Institute for Art History, J.A. Meessen}} Bound in [[Moroccan leather]], the album contained more than sixty landscapes of Padang and surrounding cities (including [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi|Fort de Kock]]).{{efn|One advertisement can be accessed at {{harvnb|Sumatra-courant 1868, Sumatra}}.}}{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} By June 1869, his studio at the Sumatra Hotel was offering workshops, as well as images from northern Sumatra<!--Mandheling in the ad--> and [[Nias]].{{sfn|Sumatra-courant 1869, (untitled)}}

Altogether, Meessen's photographic ventures in the Indies&nbsp;&ndash; and the resulting albums&nbsp;&ndash; cost some 34,000&nbsp;[[Netherlands Indies gulden]], which included camera equipment (though it is not known what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his [[albumen print]]s.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}{{sfn|Netherlands Institute for Art History, J.A. Meessen}} In his [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the ''Bataviaasch Handelsblad'' wrote, "made taking images of the people outside [[Java]] almost impossible".{{efn|Original: "...  fanatiekste bijgeloof het nemen van volkstypen buiten Java bijna onmogelijk maakt."}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch Handelsblad 1878, Wetenschap}} Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5&nbsp;a.m. the following morning I found some 60&nbsp;warriors waiting for me on the beach."{{efn|Original: "Bij aankomst liet ik een paar schoten vallen, en haalde de Hollandsche vlag in top en al spoedig kwam men hooren wat ik wilde. Na kennisgeving daarvan beloofde men mij hulp voor den volgenden dag, om mijne goederen te transporteren, en prompt om 5 uur vond ik een 60 tal krijgers aan het strand."}}{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}

===Return to the Netherlands===
[[File:Gezicht opde Ciliwung in Jakarta, Jacobus Anthonie Meessen, 1864 - 1870 - Rijksmuseum.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ciliwung]], [[Jakarta|Batavia]], photographed by Meessen; after returning to the Netherlands, he actively marketed his images of the Indies.]]
In June 1869, Meessen and his wife returned to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen to open a new studio, named A.&nbsp;A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen&nbsp;<U+2013> best known for portraits&nbsp;<U+2013> had been interested in the possibility of expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to [[William III of the Netherlands|King William III]].{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} This album of 153&nbsp;images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, [[Borneo]], and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver [[coconut tree|coconut]] and [[banana tree]]s surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}{{sfn|Java Bode 1871, (untitled)}}

Over the next few years Meessen continued marketing his images of the Indies. In 1875 he published a collection of 250&nbsp;<U+2013> consisting of 175&nbsp;landscapes and 75&nbsp;portraits&nbsp;<U+2013>  through the [[Amsterdam]]-based printer [[J. H. De Bussy|De Bussy]]; this collection was titled ''Verzameling Fotografien van Nederlandsch Indi<U+00EB>'' (''Photographic Collection of the Dutch East Indies''), sold for 225&nbsp;gulden, and came in a [[Juglans|walnut]] box.{{sfn|Het Nieuws van den Dag 1879, Gemengd Nieuws}} At the 1875 Exposition G<U+00E9>ographique in Paris, he exhibited these images to critical acclaim. The ''Bataviaasch Handelsblad'', in one review, wrote that the attempt to document the Indies was commendable, and expressed hope that images of animals could also be taken.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Handelsblad 1878, Wetenschap}} In 1883 Meessen again exhibited his photographs, this time at the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Trade Exhibition]] in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} Ultimately, however, he does not appear to have made a return on his investment.{{sfn|Janse|2007|p=17}}

Meessen's final years were migratory, with some time spent in [[Gorredijk]] and other parts of [[Opsterland]], [[Friesland]]. He worked as a building superintendent, and later municipal architect.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} One of his projects in this capacity was an elementary school on Zuidwest Dubbele Street in Gorredijk, a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] building&nbsp;<U+2013> possibly influenced by similar schools in {{ill|nl|Raamsdonkveer}} and Amsterdam&nbsp;<U+2013> constructed to replace an older school which had been demolished.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} Meessen died in Opsterland on 14&nbsp;November 1885 after being stricken by an illness three days earlier.{{sfn|Het Nieuws van den Dag 1885, Familiebericht}} The incomplete school was finished by [[Hidde Petrus Nicolaas Halbertsma]].{{efn|This school, which closed in 1955, now houses the Opsterland Museum. It is a [[Rijksmonument]] {{harv|Gorredijk Historie, De Voormalige}}.}}{{sfn|Gorredijk Historie, De Voormalige}}{{sfn|Stenvert|Kolman|Broekhoven|van Ginkel-Meester|2000|p=143}}

==Style and legacy==
[[File:Njai by Meessen, c 1867.jpg|thumb|[[Hand-colouring of photographs|Hand-tinted]] photograph of a ''[[njai]]'' by Meessen, {{circa}} 1867. He described the concubines as a "necessary evil".{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}]]
Reviewing the quality of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese pictures are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his [[cityscape]]s. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the [[Merdeka Palace|Governor General's Palace]] and the home of [[Raden Saleh]]. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were [[Hand-colouring of photographs|hand-tinted]].{{sfn|Bataviaasch Handelsblad 1878, Wetenschap}}

Meessen's from the album he gave to King William&nbsp;III are kept in [[the Hague]] at the [[National Library of the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Yayasan Untuk Indonesia|2005b|pp=6<U+2013>7}} This album features a travelogue regarding Meessen's photography, as well as images from six islands (Java, Sumatra, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Belitung]], Borneo, and Nias) and various ethnic groups, including the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], and [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. He includes commentary on several images of people, noting in an image of ''[[njai]]'' (concubines): "[They are] a necessary evil for the military. They preserve, in and outside the barracks, the best discipline, and prove invaluable in expeditions or sea journeys."{{efn|Original: "Een noodzakelijk kwaad voor den militair, bewaren zij in en buiten de kaserne de beste tucht, terwijl op expediti<U+00EB>n of reizen over zee deze vrouwen onschatbare diensten bewijzen."}}{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}

Two further photographs, one of the river [[Ciliwung]] in Batavia, and another of Kali Mati in Padang, are held at the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam.{{sfn|Rijksmuseum, Jacobus}} The [[Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies]] holds a copy of the De Bussy publication, and the [[Leiden University Library]] holds 281&nbsp;prints, 7&nbsp;of which are of disputed provenance, which were donated to the [[Royal Dutch Geographical Society]] by Pieter Johannes Veth in 1891.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}} The four extant collections of Meessen's work are considerably fewer than those of his contemporaries such as Woodbury and Page, and his oeuvre has been little studied or collected.{{sfn|Boom|Wachlin|2004}}
