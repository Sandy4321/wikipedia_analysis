'''New York State Route 915E''' (named '''Third Avenue Extension''') is an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]] in [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]], [[New York]]. The western terminus of the route is at [[New York State Route 151|NY 151]] east of the [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]] city limits. The eastern terminus is at [[U.S. Route 4 (New York)|U.S. Route 4]] south of the hamlet of Defreestville. NY 915E was once designated as '''New York State Route 381''' and was once part of [[New York State Route 43|NY 43]].

==Route description==
NY 915E begins at the intersection of Third Avenue Extension ([[New York State Route 151|NY 151]] west of this point) and Barracks Road (NY 151 east of the junction) in [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]] east of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]]. The route heads eastward, paralleling a minor tributary of [[Mill Creek]] as it provides access to New Rural [[Cemetery]] and several residential housing tracks. Roughly midway between NY 151 and [[U.S. Route 4 (New York)|U.S. Route 4]], Third Avenue Extension passes under [[Interstate 90 (New York)|Interstate 90]].

East of the I-90 overpass, the development along NY 915E becomes more commercial and industrial in nature as the homes west of I-90 give way to warehouses east of the expressway. Third Avenue Extension continues eastward amidst the warehouses to US 4, where both Third Avenue and NY 915E come to an end.

Reference markers on Third Avenue Extension still bear the 43 notation, for both Reference Route 915E and the segment re-designated NY 151.<ref name=2006tdr /> The markers were also not moved. The marker in the infobox above illustrates the first marker falling on the 915E portion.

==History==
All of Third Avenue Extension between modern [[New York State Route 151|NY 151]] and [[U.S. Route 4 (New York)|U.S. Route 4]] in [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]], as well as Third Avenue, East Street, and 2nd Avenue to Broadway (then-[[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route 9]] and [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|U.S. Route 20]]) in [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]], was designated as the westernmost portion of [[New York State Route 152|NY 152]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> By 1947, NY 152 was truncated on its western end to US 4 in Defreestville while its former routing into Rensselaer was redesignated as NY 381. Unlike NY 152, NY 381 was routed solely on Third Avenue and terminated at the intersection of Broadway (then [[New York State Route 43|NY 43]]) and Third Avenue.<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |edition=1947-48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref>

NY 381 remained intact until the late 1960s when NY 43 was rerouted within the Rensselaer area to follow Third Avenue and Third Avenue Extension between the [[Hudson River]] and US 4, supplanting NY 381 in the process.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-albany-1967.jpg|title=Albany, N.Y., Conn., Mass., N.H., VT.|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=1967|scale=1 : 250,000|series=Eastern United States 1 : 250,000|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf|title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State|date=[[1970-01-01]]|author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> NY 43 remained on Third Avenue until the late 1990s, when it was rerouted to meet [[Interstate 90 (New York)|Interstate 90]] at the new exit 8 west of Defreestville. After the re-routing of NY 43, NY 151 was extended westward from its former terminus at former NY 43, assuming Third Avenue from the downtown terminus to Barracks Road, its former terminus.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |title=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-528-96764-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |title=Rand McNally Road Atlas |year=1998 |page=67 |isbn=0-528-83935-7}}</ref> The remaining portion of former NY 43 was redesignated '''Reference Route 915E''' by [[NYSDOT]].
