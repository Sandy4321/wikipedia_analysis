But by the end of those four years, I had become very popular, by just being myself, and being relatable."<ref name="WickedLocal"/>

Leupp calls [[Robin Williams]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Bette Midler]] some of his early idols.<ref name="WickedLocal"/> In a 2012 interview he said, "When I was younger, I looked up to people who were like Bette Midler and [[Lily Tomlin]], people who created characters and got discovered that way. I always knew early on that I was gay and I wanted to be an openly gay performer. Back when I started, that was pretty rare. I was trained in the theater and I went to college for theater, and I decided to do drag as a way to express myself both in theater and as an activist. I always find that people who are able to do all of that an inspiration. I feel like Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler, early on, did that. ... [Midler] started in the bathhouses and gay men wrote her material. Of course she had the performance style to pull it off, but she also had gay men writing for her. That<U+2019>s why her voice had that gay sensibility."<ref name="Backlot 2012-10"/> He decided "it was probably best for me to be openly gay on stage, and create my own character. I did a one-person show early on as myself ... All my friends came, and loved it; I was always considered funny. But I knew it wasn<U+2019>t going to be enough. With friends who were sick, and dying of HIV/AIDS, I wanted to be an activist as well as an entertainer.<U+201D><ref name="WickedLocal"/> Leupp recalled thinking, "how do I change people<U+2019>s minds, those who might not have a clear picture of who gay people were?"<ref name="WickedLocal"/> He said, "Coco came about at a time in my life when I didn<U+2019>t have much direction ... I realized I had to do something that made me unique ... I read a book about Native Americans '[[two spirits]],' which were men who dressed as women or partially as women who were often seen as the [[shaman]] or the storytellers in their communities."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> "Wouldn<U+2019>t it be great if I did something in drag, I decided, where people perceive you as a drag queen in a way, but as I tell the story <U+2014> my story <U+2014> they would forget I<U+2019>m a drag queen and just relate to the story. This is what I had in mind when I started writing my first drag show.<U+201D><ref name="WickedLocal"/> 

"So I put all those things together: I<U+2019>m a drag queen/two spirit/gay activist/entertainer. And everything fell into place. It was really a magical time in my life," Leupp said.<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> To find Coco's signature hairdo, he tried blonde and black wigs but thought they looked terrible; when he tried red, Leupp said "that<U+2019>s the color."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> "My first hairdo was very [[Tina Louise]]/''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' <U+2014> very big. It evolved into the straight with flip going under, then I tried it with the flip going out <U+2014> and I said, <U+2019>That<U+2019>s Coco.<U+2019> Other drag queens have chided me for not changing my hairdo, but I just feel it is so much part of the persona and so recognizable, I don<U+2019>t want to change it."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> Leupp said his parents were very supportive, "But when I did do drag for the first time I had already done a one-person show about being gay. When I did that they were terrified <U+2014> they thought I was going to have things thrown at me. But when I got applause, they realized there<U+2019>s a big world out there that they didn<U+2019>t know about. So when I decided to do drag, they were nervous, but hid it. And I think they were happy that I was received with such love when they expected me to be greeted with tomatoes."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/>

Leupp later "realized the potential of drag as full-blown theater" through the work of playwright and drag performer [[Charles Busch]].<ref name="WickedLocal"/>

==Career==
Leupp's first one-person show was ''Miss Coco Peru in My Goddamn Cabaret'' in 1992.<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> Several more Coco Peru shows followed, as well as a 1994 guest role on ''[[New York Undercover]]'' and appearances in both ''[[Wigstock: The Movie]]'' and ''[[To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar]]'' in 1995.<ref name="Rage 2010-09">{{cite web|url=http://www.ragemonthly.com/2010/09/09/redheads-make-more-fun-hot-talk-with-miss-coco-peru/ |title=Redheads Make More Fun! Hot Talk with Miss Coco Peru |date=September 9, 2010 |first=Jared |last=Cox |website=RageMonthly.com |publisher= ''Rage Monthly'' |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref> Peru next had a role in the 1997 romantic comedy ''Nick and Jane''. Her follow-up was the 1999 independent film ''[[Trick (film)|Trick]]''.<ref name="Backlot 2012-10"/><ref name="Sundance 1999"/> According to Peru, ''Trick'' director [[Jim Fall]] was a friend and fan, and five years before the film was shot she helped him audition actors by reading the role which ultimately went to [[Tori Spelling]].<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> Peru's role in the film was added specifically for her: "They wrote me a part, which I rewrote using my own experiences. I wrote that line 'It burns.' Most of the part was written by me, which is why I played it so well."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/>

Peru later starred in [[Richard Day (writer)|Richard Day]]'s ''[[Girls Will Be Girls (film)|Girls Will Be Girls]]'' (2003) and was one of six performers featured in the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] original [[stand-up comedy]] series ''[[Wisecrack]]'' (2005).<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/><ref name="Sundance 2003"/><ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> She has appeared in a number of other supporting and guest-starring roles in television and film, including ''[[Will & Grace]]'' in 2001, ''[[Arrested Development (TV Series)|Arrested Development]]'' in 2005 and ''[[Twins (TV series)|Twins]]'' in 2006;<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/><ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] reality series ''[[Boy Meets Boy (TV series)|Boy Meets Boy]]'' (2003) and ''[[Welcome to the Parker]]'' (2007);<ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> the [[police procedural]] drama series ''[[Detroit 1-8-7]]'' in 2011; the 2004 comedy film ''[[Straight-Jacket]]'';<ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> and a 2007<U+2013>2008 [[web series]] follow-up to ''Girls Will Be Girls''.<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> Peru performed the voice of "Mama Hippo" in the 2006 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated feature ''[[The Wild]]'',<ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> and later was the voice of Mother Morally Superior in a 2008 episode of the [[Logo TV|Logo]] [[stop motion]] animated series ''[[Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World]]''. In 2004 Peru appeared in an [[Orbitz]] TV commercial that was later nominated for a [[GLAAD Media Award]].<ref name="Orbitz">{{cite web |url=http://www.adrespect.org/common/adlibrary/adlibrarydetails.cfm?QID=1699&clientID=11064 |title=Video Ad Library: Orbitz |website=AdRespect.org |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Rage 2010-09"/>

In 2008 Leupp said, "I'm not impersonating a woman. It's just an extension of me. I'm telling autobiographical stories, and Coco gives me the freedom to be a little more outrageous and say things I wouldn't say in everyday life ... Drag allows me to embrace a lot of the things I hated about myself growing up ... Having been called a girl-boy and all that, drag is a way of saying, I'm going to embrace everything that anybody said about me, and put it out there on stage. People have said I shouldn't call myself a drag queen, that I do a disservice to myself. My reaction is I'm proud to be what I am. When I see video footage of [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]], I am proud to be a part of that history. I'm not saying that I am historical, but just being out there doing the drag, on television, in movies ... I have young nephews ... who know Coco, and who think it<U+2019>s great that I dress up as a girl. In this way, I am changing the world."<ref name="WickedLocal"/>

==Personal life==
Leupp knew he was gay at an early age.<ref name="Backlot 2012-10"/> He met his partner Rafael, a college professor originally from Spain, around 1995.<ref name="Charlotte 2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Blogs/Revue/June-2012/Miss-Coco-Peru-Tells-All/ |title=Miss Coco Peru Tells All |website=CharlotteMagazine.com |date=June 5, 2012 |first=Page |last=Leggett |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> In 2008 they married in Spain, where same-sex marriage is legal.<ref name="WickedLocal"/><ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> 

Leupp identifies as [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]].<ref name="Edge 2013-11"/><ref name="NYDN 2013-11"/>

==Activism==
Leupp stated in an October 2012 interview that as a young gay man he "decided to do drag as a way to express myself both in theater and as an activist."<ref name="Backlot 2012-10"/> "With friends who were sick, and dying of HIV/AIDS," he said in 2008, "I wanted to be an activist as well as an entertainer.<U+201D><ref name="WickedLocal"/>

In a 2008 interview, Leupp said that when [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on the ''Girls Will Be Girls'' concept as a [[situation comedy]], it was instead produced as a film "hoping that the new gay networks would be interested."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> They were not, about which Leupp commented, "I think that drag is scary, even in our own community. They would rather play it safe. People want to be really politically correct, which I think is very dangerous. I<U+2019>ve heard from various people in the business that these stations are appealing to Middle America, and I find that very disturbing because I always felt that we as gay people were the leaders <U+2014> we decided what was funny, what was hot in fashion. Now we are trying to figure out what Middle America accepts. I<U+2019>m not interested in that. I<U+2019>m not trying to appeal to Middle America, and that gay people are doing so only makes me angry."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/>

When asked what he was most proud of among Peru's many awards and recognitions, Leupp as Peru said in 2010, "I love when I get feedback from young gay people who tell me that my show or appearances on Logo helped them in a positive way to deal with their own identity. Recently, a young guy came up to me in Provincetown after my show and said, 'I love your anger. We<U+2019>re not angry enough and you inspired me.' I was in heaven!"<ref name="Rage 2010-09"/> 

In November 2013, Leupp made headlines when he publicly protested the booking of a retired priest involved in [[reparative therapy]] to speak at Leupp's former high school, Cardinal Spellman Catholic in the Bronx.<ref name="Edge 2013-11"/><ref name="NYDN 2013-11"/> According to the school, Father Donald Timone would speak to parents about Catholic groups intended to convince children "struggling with same-sex attraction" to live "chaste lives through participation in support groups."<ref name="Edge 2013-11"/><ref name="NYDN 2013-11"/> Leupp said of the programs, "It makes it look like it<U+2019>s a support group, but once you really see what they are doing it<U+2019>s disturbing ... They are trying to shame these kids!"<ref name="Edge 2013-11"/><ref name="NYDN 2013-11"/> After further controversy over the issue among the school, alumni, gay activists and anti-gay activists, Timone's appearance was postponed until further notice but not officially cancelled.<ref name="Edge 2013-11"/><ref name="NYDN 2013-11"/>

Edge Boston called Coco Peru "one of the most recognizable figures of the New York drag scene and beyond."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/> In a review of ''Miss Coco Peru is Undaunted!'' the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the show "details how often Miss Coco has straddled the divide between saint and sinner, ladylike sweetness and stevedore crassness ... Miss Coco sings, sasses, and tells stories, usually about her own past. Wry and uncensored, the show is a hilarious exorcism, with music, no less."<ref name="Edge 2008-08"/>
