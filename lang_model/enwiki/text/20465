'''''Transilvanian Hunger''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[black metal]] band [[Darkthrone]]. It was released in 1994, through [[Peaceville Records]].  
== Background ==

''Transilvanian Hunger'' was the band's first album to be recorded with just two members, [[Nocturno Culto]] and [[Fenriz]], following the departure of [[Ivar Enger|Zephyrous]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> The band would remain a duo from this point onwards.

The back cover of the album states that "Darkthrone is for all the evil in man". Fenriz appears on the cover artwork, which bears resemblance to [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s 1993 live album ''[[Live in Leipzig]]''.

=== Contribution of Varg Vikernes ===

Lyrics for four of the album's songs were written by the infamous Norwegian black metal musician [[Varg Vikernes]]. Vikernes was imprisoned in 1993 for the murder of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] guitarist [[Euronymous|<U+00D8>ystein "Euronymous" Aarseth]] and for the arson of several churches.

The ending of the song "As Flittermice As Satans Spys" contains a [[backmasking|backmasked]] message; when the voice is played in reverse, it utters the phrase "In the name of God, let the churches burn."<ref name=peaceville>{{cite web |url=http://peaceville.com/bands/2194 |title=Bands <U+00BB> Peaceville |author=[[Fenriz]] |work=[[Peaceville Records|peaceville.com]] |accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref>

== Controversy ==

Originally, the back cover displayed the phrase "Norsk Arisk Black Metal" ("Norwegian [[Aryan]] black metal"). The band said that they had used "Arisk" to mean "true".<ref name=peaceville/> Due to the negative response from many distributors, however, the phrase was removed. The band also intended to include another controversial statement with the album: "We would like to state that ''Transilvanian Hunger'' stands beyond any criticism. If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior."<ref name="MusicMight biography">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/norway/kolbotn/darkthrone |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: Darkthrone |work=[[MusicMight]] |accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> In a press release, Peaceville Records issued both this statement and their own response, acknowledging that they could not censor their artists but also taking the opportunity to condemn its sentiment.<ref name="MusicMight biography"/> The incident caused Darkthrone to write a formal apology released at Peaceville's behest, including statements explaining that calling something "Jewish" was part of their "slang" words, of which was used in a demeaning way. The band and Peaceville ended up parting ways after the album's release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peaceville.com/bands/2194 |title=Bands <U+00BB> Peaceville |author=[[Fenriz]] |work=[[Peaceville Records|peaceville.com]] |accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref>

As a response to this controversy, Darkthrone included the following statement on their next album, ''[[Panzerfaust (album)|Panzerfaust]]'', the following year: "Darkthrone is certainly not a Nazi band nor a political band. Those of you who still might think so, you can lick [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother Mary]]'s asshole in eternity."<ref name="MusicMight biography"/>

== Reissue ==

In 2003, the album was [[remaster]]ed and reissued by Peaceville, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard [[Digipak]]. The fourth and final chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) between Fenriz and Nocturno Culto was also included as bonus material.

== Legacy ==

In an album artwork special edition of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine, the cover of ''Transilvanian Hunger'' was listed as one of the greatest album covers. The magazine regarded it as representative of their "musical regression" ideologies, and as a "stark image of evil that was never quite equalled".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
