The '''2009 [[Cotton Bowl (game)|AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic]]''' was the 73rd edition of the annual [[college football]] [[bowl game]] that was part of the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season]] and was one of 34 games in the [[NCAA football bowl games, 2008-09|2008-09 bowl season]]. The game featured the [[2008 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]] and the [[2008 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Ole Miss won the game 47<U+2013>34, in what turned out to be the highest scoring game in front of the largest Cotton Bowl crowd in history.

The game was played on January 2, 2009, at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|self-named stadium]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], and was televised in the United States on [[Fox Sports (USA)|FOX]]. This was the final Cotton Bowl Classic to be played at the stadium in the home of the [[State Fair of Texas]], [[Fair Park]]. Starting in 2010, the game will be played at the [[Dallas Cowboys New Stadium]] in nearby [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]]. 

==Game Summary==
===First Half===
Texas Tech was able to convert a pair of early turnovers into an early lead. The Raiders had the first two scores (both touchdowns) of the game with a 35 yard pass from Graham Harrell at the 6:31 mark of the first quarter and a Darcel McBath 45 yard [[interception]] return at the 5:22 mark of the first quarter to start the game with a 14-0 lead over the Ole Miss Rebels.

However, Ole Miss [[quarterback]] Jevan Snead was able to lead the Rebels to touchdowns on their next three drives, and a late [[field goal]] by Joshua Shene put the Rebels up 24-21 going into halftime.

===Second Half===
The second half began with a Marshay Green 65 yard interception return for the Rebels which gave them a 10 point lead, 31-21. Ole Miss would remain in the lead over Texas Tech for the rest of the game, ending with a final score of 47-34.

By the end of the game, fans were chanting "S-E-C! S-E-C!"<ref>http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=290022641&confId=80</ref> in reference to the [[Southeastern Conference]], which Ole Miss is a part of, and the perceived rivalry with the [[Big 12 Conference]], with which Texas Tech is a part of. This had another meaning, as it foreshadowed the next week in the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]], which pitted the [[2008 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]], also of the SEC, against the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]], also of the Big 12.

==Records==
The game was the highest scoring game in Cotton Bowl history.

After the game, the Rebels are 20-12 all-time in bowl games, with this being their fourth Cotton Bowl appearance. In their last appearance, they beat Oklahoma State by three points in the 2004 Cotton Bowl.

After the game, Texas Tech is now 10-21-1 all-time in bowl games. Ole Miss had 223 yards of rushing offense compared to 105 for Texas Tech. 

===Graham Harrell record===
In the game, [[Graham Harrell]] broke the record for more touchdown passes thrown than anyone in major-college history. Harrell first tied, then broke, the record with two scoring passes. The record-setting 132nd touchdown pass was a two-yard slant to [[Michael Crabtree]] early in the second quarter. ([[Colt Brennan]] had previously held the record with Hawaii, having 131 from 2005 to 2007.) Harrell passed for 364 yards, which is a Cotton Bowl record, and finished his collegiate career with 5,111 yards passing and 134 TDs.
