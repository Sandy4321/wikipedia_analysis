'''Arabic influence on the Spanish language''' has been significant due to the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula]] between 711 and 1492 AD.

==History==
The [[Spanish language]], also called ''Castilian'', is a [[Romance language]] that evolved from the Roman [[Vulgar Latin]] in central areas of the Iberian Peninsula, following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the late fifth century. [[Loan words]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] began to filter (be ''Latinized'') into Castilian as the number of Arabic speakers in the fertile lower reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley gradually increased in the 8th and 9th centuries. {{Clarify|date=December 2013|reason=which ''fertile lower reaches'' are those? and why only this path? }} This lexical influence reached its greatest level during the Christian [[Reconquista]], when the emerging [[Kingdom of Castile]] conquered large territories from [[Moors|Moorish]] rulers in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. These territories had large numbers of speakers of Arabic, as well as many who spoke local Romance dialects ([[Mozarabic language]]) that were heavily influenced by Arabic. Arabic words and their derivatives were also brought into Castilian by [[Mozarab]] Christians who emigrated northwards from [[Al Andalus]] in times of [[sectarian violence]], particularly during the times of [[Almohad]] and [[Almoravid]] rule in the 12th and 13th centuries.

The degree to which the Arabic language percolated through the Iberian Peninsula varied enormously from one area to another and is the subject of academic debate. However, it is generally agreed that Arabic was used among the local elites, Muslim and Christian, and that the prevalent vernacular in many areas was [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], a continuum of Arabic-influenced local Romance dialects. Only the southern [[Emirate of Granada]] in the time of  the [[Nasrid dynasty]], which had had a large influx of Arabic speakers as the Reconquista advanced, became totally Arabized, or at least no evidence of a local Romance in the late Middle Ages has been found.

Much of the Arabic influence upon Spanish came indirectly through the various Arabized Romance dialects that were spoken in areas under Moorish rule, known today by scholars as [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]]. This resulted in Spanish often having both Arabic and Latin derived words with the same meaning. For example, ''aceituna'' and ''oliva'' (olive), ''alacr<U+00E1>n'' and ''escorpi<U+00F3>n'' (scorpion), ''jaqueca'' and ''migra<U+00F1>a'' (migraine), ''alcanc<U+00ED>a'' and ''hucha'' (piggy bank).

The influence of the Arabized Mozarabic and of Arabic itself is more noticeable in the Spanish dialects from regions with a longer history of Moorish domination than those where it was shorter-lived. For this reason, the dialects of the southern half of the country, known collectively as ''castellano meridional'' or Southern Castilian, seem collectively to show a higher degree of preference for Arabisms. Northern Spanish dialects tend to prefer Romance synonyms to terms of Arabic origin, such as the Romance ''calendario'' vs. Arabic ''almanaque'', ''hucha'' vs. ''alcanc<U+00ED>a'', ''espliego'' vs. ''alhucema'', etc. However, among the southern dialects, Arabic influence does not strictly coincide with the historical retreat of Moorish rule from the Peninsula. For example, Murcian Spanish, a dialect of the south-east, has been shown to contain a much larger number of unique Arabisms than eastern (or upper) Andalusian, which is the dialect of the region with the longest Moorish history. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Because Canarian and all Latin American [[dialect]]s are mainly derived from Southern Castilian, Spanish words of Arabic origin are all present in most [[dialect|varieties]] of Modern Spanish.

A number of words were also borrowed from [[Moroccan Arabic]] principally as a result of Spain's protectorate over [[Spanish Morocco]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, although these are of minor significance.

The Spanish spoken in the [[Canary Islands]] has also adopted a small number of words from [[Hassaniya Arabic]], principally from Canarian sailors who fish in proximity to the Saharan coast as well as by those Canarians who returned from Western Sahara after the [[Green March]] of 1975.

==Lexical influence==
The influence of Arabic on the Spanish language is fundamentally lexical but its other influences are also briefly examined in this article. It is estimated that there are about one thousand Arabic [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s,<ref name="Dworkin83">{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|title=A History of the Spanish Lexicon: A Linguistic Perspective|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199541140|page=83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V4f8ZpJAhgIC&pg=PA83}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mart<U+00ED>nez Egido|first=Jos<U+00E9> Joaqu<U+00ED>n|title=Constituci<U+00F3>n del l<U+00E9>xico espa<U+00F1>ol|year=2007|page=15|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cbVIY4qAA9cC&pg=PA15}}</ref> and approximately three thousand [[Derivation (linguistics)|derived words]], for a total of around four thousand words<ref name="Dworkin83"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|title=The Arabic language|year=2003|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0748614362|page=228|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OHfse3YY6NAC&pg=PA228|edition=Repr.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lapesa|first=Raphael|title=Historia de la lengua espa<U+00F1>ola|year=1960|location=Madrid|page=97|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uJdbJK_sl2oC&pg=PA255}}</ref> or 8%<ref>{{cite journal|last=Quintana|first=Luc<U+00ED>a|author2=Mora, Juan Pablo|title=Ense<U+00F1>anza del acervo l<U+00E9>xico <U+00E1>rabe de la lengua espa<U+00F1>ola|journal=ASELE.

The exact number of words of Arabic origin and their derivatives in Spanish is not known, and many words not included on this list are [[Regionalism (linguistics)|regionalism]]s: words which are used in certain parts of Spain and/or Latin America but are generally unknown elsewhere.

The high point of Arabic word use in Spanish was in late medieval times and has declined since then, but hundreds are still used in normal conversation. The vast majority of these words are nouns, with a limited number of [[verb]]s (seven, little used at present), few [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s, and a one [[preposition]], ''hasta'' ("until"), which may reflect that as wide and very important, this influence did not change the structure of the romance language.<ref>[http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/biblioteca_fraseologica/n1_cantera/lexico_02.htm La extraordinaria riqueza de nuestros arabismos]</ref>

===List of words of Arabic origin===
This is an open list of Spanish words acquired ''directly'' from [[Classical Arabic|Classical]] and [[Andalusi Arabic]], listed in alphabetical order. This list includes the Spanish meaning of the word as well as the Arabic [[etymology]]. No fixed standard of [[Arabic transliteration]] is used.

'''Rationale for inclusion'''

''Due to the large influence of Arabic on Spanish vocabulary, this list is relatively restrictive:
''
*This list has been edited to include only words which are considered to appertain to the Spanish language and the [[Hispanic culture]] and society. Arabic words which may be understood by Spanish speakers, but remain foreign to the Hispanic civilisation such as [[ayatollah|Ayatol<U+00E1>]], [[Jihad]], or [[shia Islam|Chiita]], are excluded from this list.

*Only words which have passed directly from Arabic are included. Arabic words which entered the Spanish language through other, non-[[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], [[Indo-European languages]] (such as ''[[ayatollah|Ayatol<U+00E1>]]'', ''Beduino'', ''Sof<U+00E1>'', or ''sorbete'') are not included. Included as exceptions to this rule are ''<U+00E1>lcali'' and ''<U+00E1>lgebra'', words of Arabic origin which are thought to have entered Spanish through "[[Late Latin|Low Latin]]"<ref>Corominas, Joan (1973). ''Breve diccionario etimol<U+00F3>gico de la lengua castellana'' (Madrid: Gredos)</ref><U+2014>as suggested by their initial stress (the [[Arabic definite article|Arabic definite article ''al-'']] is not normally borrowed as a stressed syllable).

*Generally, only Spanish root words are listed, derivations not being included. For example, ''aceite'' (from ''az-zeit'', oil) is included but not ''aceiter<U+00ED>a'', ''aceitero'', ''aceit<U+00F3>n'' or ''aceitoso''. On the other hand, ''aceituna'' ([[olive]]) is included since it derives not from ''az-zeit'' but from ''az-zeituna'' in Arabic, even though the root of the ''Arabic'' word is the same. ''Aceituno'' (olive tree), on the other hand, would not be included, since it shares the same root as ''aceituna''. An exception to this rule may be made when the derived word is much more commonly used than the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]], when the meaning of the derivative has no evident connection with the root word or when it is not clear that one is derived from the other (e.g. horro and ahorrar).

*Words derived from [[Mozarabic]] are not included (Mozarabic being fundamentally a [[Romance language]]), unless the Mozarabic word is itself derived from classical or Andalusi Arabic.

*Words acquired from [[Berber languages|Berber]] or [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]] (or other [[Afro-Asiatic languages]]) are not included.

The etymology and meaning of most of these words can be verified on the site of the [http://www.rae.es Real Academia de la Lengua Espa<U+00F1>ola], although a small minority are only available in other sources or past editions of this dictionary.

Many of these words will be unfamiliar to a number of Spanish speakers because their use is restricted to certain regions or they are no longer in regular use.

===Words with a coincidental similarity to Arabic===

* '''el'''. The Spanish definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] ''el'' / ''la'' / ''lo'' / ''los'' / ''las'', like most definite articles in the [[Romance languages]], derive from the [[Latin]] demonstratives ''ille'' / ''illa'' / ''illud''. The similarity to the Arabic article ''al'' is a mere coincidence.
* '''usted'''. The formal second-person pronoun ''usted'' is derived from a shortening of the old form of address ''Vuestra merced'', as seen in dialectal Spanish ''vosted'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''vost<U+00E8>'', etc. ''Usted'' is the remaining form from a number of variants used in Renaissance Spanish, such as ''Ust<U+00E9>'', ''Uced'', ''Vuesa Merced'', ''Vuesarced'', ''Vusted'', ''Su Merced'', ''Vuesasted'' or ''Voaced''.<ref>[http://dspace.unav.es/dspace/bitstream/10171/4188/1/ART%C3%8DCULO%207_VUESTRA%20MERCED%20Y%20SUS%20ALOMORFOS%20EN%20EL%20TEATRO%20DE%20CALDER%C3%93N,%20VICTORIA%20B.%20TORRES.pdf Victoria B. TORRES: 'VUESTRA MERCED Y SUS ALOMORFOS EN EL TEATRO DE CALDER<U+00D3>N'] (In Spanish)</ref> The possibility of a link with the Arabic word ''ust<U+0101>dh'' ('mister'/'professor'/'doctor') seems very remote.

==Other influences==

#'''The suffix <U+00ED>'''. Arabic has a very common type of adjective, known as the nisba or relationship adjective, which is formed by adding the suffix -<U+012B> (masc.) or <U+064A><U+0629> -iyya (fem.) to a noun. This has given Spanish the suffix -<U+00ED> (both masc. and fem.), creating adjectives from nouns which indicate relationship or belonging. Examples are Marbell<U+00ED>, Ceut<U+00ED>, Maghreb<U+00ED>, Zaragoc<U+00ED>, Andalus<U+00ED> or Alfons<U+00ED>.
#'''Expressions'''. A number of expressions such as "<U+00A1>''Ole''!" (sometimes spelled "''ol<U+00E9>''" ), possibly from ''wa'llah'', or ''ojal<U+00E1>'', from ''law sha'a Allah'', have been borrowed directly from Arabic. Furthermore, many expressions in Spanish might have been [[calque]]d from their Arabic equivalent. Examples would be ''si Dios quiere'', ''que Dios guarde'' or ''bendito sea Dios''.

==Toponyms (place names) in Iberia of Arabic origin==

There are hundreds if not thousands of place names derived from Arabic in the Iberian peninsula including provinces and regions, cities, towns, villages and even neighborhoods and streets. They also include geographical features such as mountains, mountain ranges, valleys and rivers. Toponyms derived from Arabic are common in all of Spain (including much of the North of the country) except for those regions which never came under Muslim rule or where it was particularly short-lived. These regions include [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the Northern coast ([[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]]) as well as northern [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]]. Regions where place names of Arabic origin are particularly common are the Eastern Coast ([[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]) and the region of [[Andalusia]]. In Portugal, the frequency of Arabic toponyms increases as one travels south in the country.

Those toponyms which maintained their pre-Islamic name during the Muslim period were generally Arabized, and the mark of either the old [[Arabic phonology|Arabic pronunciation]] or the popular pronunciation from which it derived is noticeable in their modern names: e.g. Hispalis - Ishbiliya - [[Sevilla]].

==Given names and surnames==

;Given names

[[Almudena (disambiguation)|Almudena]] (from the [[Virgin of Almudena]], patroness of Madrid, Spain) and [[Fatima (name)|F<U+00E1>tima]] (derived from [[Our Lady of F<U+00E1>tima]]) are very common Spanish names rooted in the country<U+00B4>s Roman Catholic tradition, but both of which share Arabic etymologies originating in place names of religious significance. Guadalupe, a name present throughout the Spanish-speaking world, but particularly in Mexico, also shares this feature.

A number of given names of Arabic origin have been popular throughout the Spanish-speaking world for some time, such as [[Omar (name)|Omar]] or [[Soraya (disambiguation)|Soraya]] (probably popularized after the late [[Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} More recently, some other names have become popular, particularly in the Caribbean area, such as [[Zahira]].

;Surnames

Surnames of indirect Arabic origin, such as Medina, Almunia, Guadarrama or Alcaide are very common, often referring to toponyms or professions, but they don't have Arabic origin properly speaking. No Arabic surnames remain as a result of Muslim descendence, except for recent immigrants. The reason for it is that, throughout Spanish history, it was common practice for ethnic and religious minorities to change their surnames to escape persecution by the Catholic Church. Furthermore, Spanish Muslims were compelled to adopt Christian surnames by a series of royal decrees in the 16th century. 16th century Morisco leader [[Aben Humeya|Muhammad Ibn Ummaya]], for example, was born to the Christian name Fernando de C<U+00F3>rdoba y Valor.
