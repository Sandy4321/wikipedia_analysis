"'''Episode&nbsp;14'''", also known as "'''Lonely Souls'''",{{#tag:ref|Although the series did not originally have episode titles, when it was broadcast in Germany, the episodes were given titles, which are now commonly used by fans and critics.{{sfn|Riches|2011|p=40}}|group="nb"}} is the seventh episode of the [[List of Twin Peaks episodes#Season 2 (1990-1991)|second season]] of the American mystery television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''. The episode was written by series co-creator [[Mark Frost]] and directed by series co-creator [[David Lynch]]. It features series regulars [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Michael Ontkean]], [[Ray Wise]] and [[Richard Beymer]]; and guest stars [[Frank Silva]] as [[Killer BOB|Killer Bob]], [[Hank Worden]] as The Waiter and David Lynch as [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]].

''Twin Peaks'' centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl [[Laura Palmer]] ([[Sheryl Lee]]) in the small rural town in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] after which the series is named. In this episode, during the ongoing investigation into Laura's death, [[FBI]] special agent [[Dale Cooper]] (MacLachlan) and [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harry Truman|Sheriff Truman]] (Ontkean) continue to search for her killer, the demon Bob, who has possessed a human host. Aided by [[MIKE (Twin Peaks)|Mike]] (Al Strobel), Cooper and Truman arrest [[Benjamin Horne]] (Beymer), believing him to be inhabited by Bob. Later that night, Cooper is warned by [[The Giant (Twin Peaks)|The Giant]] ([[Carel Struycken]]), while Bob's real host, Leland Palmer (Wise), murders [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Maddy Ferguson|Madeline Ferguson]] (Lee).

"Episode&nbsp;14" was first broadcast on November&nbsp;10, 1990, on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 17.2&nbsp;million households in the United States, about 20&nbsp;percent of the available audience. The episode was well received, garnering positive reviews after its initial broadcast and in subsequent years, but it has been criticized for unduly prolonging the revelation of Laura's killer. Academic readings of the entry have highlighted the theme of duality and use of cinematography in the revelation scene.

Meanwhile, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Maddy Ferguson|Madeline "Maddy" Ferguson]] (Lee), Laura's cousin, has arrived in Twin Peaks from [[Missoula, Montana]], and helps Laura's friends [[Donna Hayward]] ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) and [[List of Twin Peaks characters#James Hurley|James Hurley]] ([[James Marshall (actor)|James Marshall]]) investigate the killing. Donna finds [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harold Smith|Harold Smith]] ([[Lenny Von Dohlen]]), one of Laura's friends to whom she had given a secret diary, and Donna and Maddy attempt to steal it from him.<ref name="ep13"/>

===Events===
Cooper, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Harry Truman|Sheriff Harry S.&nbsp;Truman]] ([[Michael Ontkean]]), [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Andy Brennan|Deputy Andy Brennan]] ([[Harry Goaz]]), [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Will Hayward|Doctor Hayward]] ([[Warren Frost]]) and Mike visit The Great Northern hotel in an attempt to find Bob's human host. Upon their arrival, Mike goes into a spasm, indicating that Bob has inhabited someone nearby. Meanwhile, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Deputy Tommy "Hawk" Hill|Deputy Hawk]] ([[Michael Horse]]) visits the residence of Harold Smith and finds that he has committed suicide. Hawk contacts Cooper and Truman, and they arrive at Smith's residence and discover Laura Palmer's secret diary among his belongings. Meanwhile, Maddy announces she is leaving Twin Peaks to return home.

Elsewhere, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Bobby Briggs|Bobby Briggs]] ([[Dana Ashbrook]]) and [[Shelly Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Shelly Johnson]] ([[M<U+00E4>dchen Amick]]) discuss their financial concerns regarding Shelly's [[Catatonia|catatonic]] husband [[Leo Johnson (Twin Peaks)|Leo]] ([[Eric Da Re]]). [[Audrey Horne]] ([[Sherilyn Fenn]]) confronts her father [[Ben Horne|Ben]] ([[Richard Beymer]]) over his ownership of [[One Eyed Jacks (Twin Peaks)|One Eyed Jacks]], a casino and brothel on the Canada<U+2013>United States border. When Audrey asks him whether he killed Laura Palmer, he denies it but confesses that he and Laura had a sexual relationship and that he loved her. Later, Shelly arrives for work at the Double R Diner and announces to its owner [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Norma Jennings|Norma Jennings]] ([[Peggy Lipton]]) that she is resigning to care for Leo full-time. [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Ed Hurley|Ed Hurley]] ([[Everett McGill]]) and his wife [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Nadine Hurley|Nadine]], who is experiencing [[amnesia]] and [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]]-induced strength, enter the diner. Nadine, believing she is eighteen years old, speaks to Norma, but the waitress, along with Ed, puts on a fa<U+00E7>ade and conceals the truth. Meanwhile, Bobby and his friend [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Mike Nelson|Mike Nelson]] (Gary Hershberger) break open the sole of Leo Johnson's shoe, discovering a [[microcassette]].

Cooper examines the remains of Laura's diary at the police station, finding repeated references to Bob's long-running molestation of her. Cooper also learns that Bob is a friend of Laura's father, [[Leland Palmer]] ([[Ray Wise]]), and finds an entry that seemingly implicates Ben Horne. Audrey then enters and tells Cooper about Ben and Laura's affair. After she leaves, Cooper tells Sheriff Truman about [[The Giant (Twin Peaks)|The Giant]]'s message "without chemicals, he points".<ref name="ep8"/> Cooper recalls when Mike<U+2014>who becomes active when his human host, Philip Gerard, is not on drugs<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode&nbsp;10|episodelink=List of Twin Peaks episodes#ep11|series=Twin Peaks|serieslink=Twin Peaks|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=October 13, 1990|season=2|seriesno=3|credits=[[Lesli Linka Glatter]] (director); [[Robert Engels]] (writer) }}</ref><U+2014>spasmed in The Great Northern's lobby when Ben entered. Cooper concludes that Ben is Bob's human host and arrests him.

Later that night, [[List of Twin Peaks characters#Sarah Palmer|Sarah Palmer]] ([[Grace Zabriskie]]) crawls across her living room floor and has a vision of a white horse. Cooper and Truman visit The Roadhouse at the behest of the [[Log Lady]] ([[Catherine E. Coulson]]). While a band perform, Cooper has a vision of The Giant, who tells him "it is happening again".<ref name="ep8"/> The Giant sees Leland Palmer fixing his tie, while his reflection in the mirror shows Bob. Maddy comes downstairs and sees Bob standing over Sarah's unconscious body. Bob's visage shifts back and forth between Leland's and his own. He chases Maddy up the stairs, brings her to the living room and repeatedly strangles, punches, taunts and kisses her before ramming her head into a glass picture frame, killing her. Bob places a letter "O" under her fingernails, as he had done with other letters on past victims. Cooper's vision ends, and The Waiter ([[Hank Worden]]) tells Cooper he is sorry. Donna and James cry during the band's final song.

==Production==
[[File:David Lynch Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|"Episode 14" was directed by [[David Lynch]], who co-created ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.|alt=A man in a green shirt and a black suit smiles at the camera.]]

"Episode&nbsp;14" was written by series co-creator [[Mark Frost]], who had written six previous episodes and directed the first season finale, "[[Episode 7 (Twin Peaks)|Episode&nbsp;7]]".<ref name="frost filmog"/> Frost co-wrote three further installments<U+2014>"[[Episode 16 (Twin Peaks)|Episode&nbsp;16]]", "[[List of Twin Peaks episodes#ep27|Episode&nbsp;26]]" and "[[List of Twin Peaks episodes#ep30|Episode&nbsp;29]]".<ref name="frost filmog">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/mark-frost-p90674 |title=Mark Frost&nbsp;movies, photos, movie reviews, filmography, and biography |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> This episode was directed by Lynch, the fifth such episode of ''Twin Peaks''; he later directed "[[Episode 29 (Twin Peaks)|Episode&nbsp;29]]", the series' finale.<ref name="lynch filmog">{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Ankeny |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/david-lynch-p100454/ |title=David Lynch&nbsp;movies, photos, movie reviews, filmography, and biography |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> It was rated [[TV-14]] in the United States during its original television broadcast;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/twin-peaks-1990/episode-7-season-2/lonely-souls/100557 |title=Twin Peaks Episode: Lonely Souls |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref> it was later re-rated to [[TV-PG]].<ref name=itunes>{{cite web |url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/twin-peaks-season-2/id363775744 |title=Twin Peaks, Season 2 |work=[[iTunes Store]] |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref> Lynch has later stated that he feels he was able to show more on screen in the episode than he expected the network's standards and practicies office to allow. He credits this to the unusual imagery used, adding "if it's not quite standard it sneaks through, but it could be that the 'not quite standard' things make it even more terrifying and disturbing".{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=178}}

The cast of ''Twin Peaks'' did not know who would be revealed as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland would not be the eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said "Ray, it was you, it was always you".<ref name="wise roles"/> However, Wise felt that the end result was "beautiful", and that it left him and his character "satisfied and redeemed".<ref name="wise roles">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ray-wise,2553/ |title=Ray Wise {{!}} TV {{!}} Random Roles |first= Steven |last= Hyden |date=December 4, 2008 |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |publisher=[[The Onion]] |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter [[Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer]], who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel ''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]''.<ref>[[#Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer Lynch]], 00:09<U+2013>00:41</ref>

Lynch has mentioned that he tried to avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=179}} He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated "each week, you know, they [the writers for ''The Fugitive''] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=180}}

===Cinematography===
The climactic murder of Madeline Ferguson in the episode features extensive use of [[jump cut]]s to portray Leland Palmer's [[spirit possession]], switching rapidly between actors Ray Wise and Frank Silva.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=75}} The scene is unusually long for a murder on television, lasting over four minutes.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=76}} Some of its elements, including the insertion of a paper letter under Ferguson's fingernail and the use of jump cuts to events in the Roadhouse bar, are intended to echo similar aspects of "[[Pilot (Twin Peaks)|Pilot]]".{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=75<U+2013>76}}

Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, in their book ''The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions'', have drawn attention to the use of [[mise en sc<U+00E8>ne]] early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's "bric-<U+00E0>-brac". This technique draws attention to the painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on "the famous homecoming queen shot" of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible.{{sfn|Sheen|Davison|2004|p=99}} Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the "emotional claustrophobia" felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.{{sfn|Sheen|Davison|2004|p=99}}

==Themes==
The revelation scene, in which Bob is shown to have inhabited Leland Palmer, has been noted for its sense of duality, a common theme throughout ''Twin Peaks''. In ''Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks'', David Lavery wrote that upon The Giant's appearance to Dale Cooper, "The Giant has transmuted the public place into something private". Lavery added that the murder scene is "in the living room, the public within the private".{{sfn|Lavery|1995|p=75}} He summarised that the ambiguity between the public perception and the private perception<U+2014>"the outer and the inner"<U+2014>"reverberates" throughout the scene.{{sfn|Lavery|1995|p=75}} In his view, Maddy Ferguson was Laura Palmer's "double" and Leland is "doubled" by Bob. However, Lavery referred to the duality of Leland and Bob as a "subjective formation" and added that the use of jump cuts "could be Maddy's view of Leland just as much as Leland's view of himself".{{sfn|Lavery|1995|p=76}}

This scene has also been noted by critic Sue Lafky from the ''[[Journal of Film and Video]]'' as one of several in the series that suggest incest and [[necrophilia]]. She speculated that "Leland/Bob may have raped the dead or dying Maddie",<ref name="genderpower"/> comparing this to the "necrophilic fantasies" that Laura Palmer's corpse evokes, and Ben Horne's unwitting brush with incest when he encounters his daughter Audrey at a brothel.<ref name="genderpower">{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-52220534.html |title=Gender, power, and culture in the televisual world of Twin Peaks: A feminist critique |work=[[Journal of Film and Video]] |publisher=[[University Film and Video Association]] |first=Sue |last=Lafky |date=October 1, 1999 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode&nbsp;7 |episodelink=List of Twin Peaks episodes#ep8 |series=[[Twin Peaks]] |number=8 |season=1 | credits=[[Mark Frost]] (writer and director) |airdate=May 23, 1990 |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}</ref>

"Episode&nbsp;14" first aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network on November&nbsp;10, 1990. The initial broadcast was viewed by 17.2&nbsp;million households in the United States, making it the fifty-first most-viewed broadcast episode for the week.

The episode was well received critically. Writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Richard Roeper]] noted that fans and critics had begun to lose interest in the series by this point, but felt that "even at its most strained and obtuse, [''Twin Peaks''] displays more imagination and effort than almost everything else in TV land".<ref name=Roeper/> He added that viewers may have been put off by the series' frame of time, explaining that only two weeks of narrative time had elapsed since "Pilot", a slow pace contrasted with the "fast-forward, instant payoff philosophy of most television".<ref name=Roeper>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4026785.html |title='Twin Peaks' still piques a devoted fan's interest |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|first=Richard |last=Roeper |date=November 15, 1990 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> [[AllRovi]]'s Andrea LeVasseur described the installment as "pivotal", noting that it "answers some of the series' long-running questions".<ref name=allrovi>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/twin-peaks-episode-14-v261395/ |title=Twin Peaks: Episode&nbsp;14 (1990)&nbsp; Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |first=Andrea |last=LeVasseur |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Keith Phipps rated the episode an "A", adding "it's not like there's any shortage of action".<ref name="avc"/> He felt that the effects used in the episode were effective and frightening while still seeming low-key. In his view, the episode's blending of surrealism and horror was similar to scenes from Lynch's 2001 film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. Phipps described the climactic murder as "one of the most disturbing moments in the Lynch filmography", adding that it was a recurring Lynchian theme to represent the end of innocence as an actual death.<ref name="avc">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/episode-14,12793/|title='Episode&nbsp;14' {{!}} Twin Peaks {{!}} TV Club|work=[[The A.V.

Keith Uhlich, writing for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', described the episode as "quintessential Lynch, perhaps his finest work", noting that the climactic murder scene was more powerful because of its necessary use of implication and suggestion.<ref name="slant"/> However, Uhlich felt that the installment was "a tough act to follow", arguing that the only subsequent installments that competed with it were the series' finale and the 1992 [[psychological thriller]] film ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', which is based on ''Twin Peaks''.<ref name="slant">{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/twin-peaks-the-second-season/1109 |title=Twin Peaks: The Second Season {{!}} DVD Review |first=Keith |last=Uhlich |work=[[Slant Magazine]]  |date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> [[DVD Talk]]'s Jamie S.
