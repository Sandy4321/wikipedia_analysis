'''''Psylliodes luridipennis''''', commonly known as the '''Lundy cabbage flea beetle''' or the '''bronze Lundy cabbage flea beetle''' is a species of [[flea beetle]] endemic to the island of [[Lundy]], where it lives and feeds upon the endemic [[Lundy cabbage]] (''Coincya wrightii''). Along with the [[true weevil]] ''[[Ceutorhynchus contractus]]'' var. ''pallipes'' and an undescribed [[race (biology)|race]] of flea beetle ''[[Psylliodes napi]]'', it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by [[Thomas Vernon Wollaston]] in the 1840s, and was named by Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.

Adult Lundy cabbage flea beetle measure around {{convert|3|mm}} in length. They have brassy-green heads and bodies, with reddish-brown [[elytra]]. The adults feed upon the leaves of the Lundy cabbage, while the larvae [[leaf miner|mine]] into the plants to feed. The species is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages, particularly due to invasive [[common rhododendron]]s (''Rhododendron ponticum'').

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The species was first collected by [[Thomas Vernon Wollaston]], who visited Lundy in 1844 and 1845. He collected specimens of 153 species of beetle, including a specimen of the species that later became known as ''P. luridipennis''.<ref>{{cite book|chapter= The terrestrial ecology of Lundy: Origins, progress and the future |chapterurl= http://www.lundy.org.uk/download/procs/LFS_Proceedings_Part_10.pdf|author= Parsons, Tony|title= Lundy Studies: Proceedings of the 60th anniversary symposium of the Lundy Field Society|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9530532-1-6|publisher= Lundy Field Society|pages= 132<U+2013>8|editor= George, Jennifer J.}}</ref> [[Charles Owen Waterhouse]] listed the species in volume 2 of the ''[[Entomologist's Monthly Magazine]]'' as "''Psylliodes'' 6 sp. <U+2014>?",<ref name="Rye"/> and it was formally described and named by Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in the journal ''[[Wiener Entomologische Monatschrift]]'' in 1864.<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Beitr<U+00E4>ge zur Kenntniss der europ<U+00E4>ischen Halticinen|trans_title= Contributions to the knowledge of European flea beetles|journal= Wiener Entomologische Monatschrift|year= 1864|volume= 8|url= http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/98236#page/7/mode/1up|pages= 373<U+2013>472|language= German|author=Kutschera, Franz}}</ref>

The ancestors of the modern ''P. luridipennis'' population would have been unable to survive on Lundy during the [[Last glacial period|ice age]]. As such, the species must either be a [[Relict (biology)|relict species]] (a species once more widespread), a species which is not unique to Lundy with other undiscovered populations, or the result of comparatively recent [[speciation]] on or near Lundy.<ref name="Compton et. al."/> One climactic and geological study suggests "that the ancestors of Lundy cabbage and its beetles may have had the opportunity to colonise Lundy across land during a few hundred years around 10,800 years ago or may subsequently have been aided by [now gone] 'stepping stone' land to the north east" of the island.<ref name="Compton et. al."/>

==Ecology and distribution==

Adult ''Psylliodes luridipennis'' beetles are invariably found on the [[Lundy cabbage]] (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of [[Lundy]], where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other [[Brassicaceae|crucifers]] taken from gardens.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= http://lundy.org.uk/download/ar31/LFS_Annual_Report_Vol_31_Part_21.pdf|title= Status of the Lundy cabbage, ''Rhyncosinapis wrightii''|journal= Annual Report of the Lundy Field Society|year= 1980|volume=31|author= Cassidy, M.

''Psylliodes luridipennis'' is found throughout the highly limited range of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House. The insects also found their way to Lundy cabbages artificially seeded within the cabbage's range within a year.<ref name="Compton et. al."/> It had been hypothesised that ''P. luridipennis'' and ''Ceutorhynchus contractus'' var. ''pallipes'' may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage,<ref name="Leadlay and Heywood">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1095-8339.1990.tb01884.x}}</ref> but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no [[honey bee]]s on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon [[pollen beetles]] of the genus ''[[Meligethes]]'' and [[wind pollination|the wind for pollination]].<ref name="Compton and Key">{{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00477.x}}</ref>

==Conservation==
Along with the Lundy cabbage, ''Psylliodes luridipennis'' has been listed in the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]],<ref name="Compton and Key"/> and an action plan for its conservation, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]'', an [[alien species]] which threatens the Lundy cabbage.<ref>Compton, S.G.; Key, R.S.; Key, R.J.D.; Parkes, E. (1998). "A strategy for control of the alien weed ''Rhododendron ponticum'' on Lundy in relation to the conservation of the endemic plant Lundy cabbage, ''Coincya wrightii''." ''English Nature Research Reports'', '''263''': 1<U+2013>67.</ref> The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than ''P. napi'' to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.<ref name="Compton et. al."/>

The [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]] recognise ''Psylliodes luridipennis'' as a "priority species" for conservation purposes, due to the fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though the committee notes that "[h]ost plant numbers have been low, but relatively stable since 2001", it claims that ''P. luridipennis'' "has been noticeably difficult to find in recent years". Based on pre-1994 [[IUCN Red List]] guidelines, the species was informally deemed as "[[vulnerable species|vulnerable]]".<ref>{{cite web|author= [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]|title= UK Priority Species data collection: ''Psylliodes luridipennis''|url= http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/_speciespages/538.pdf|publisher=  [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]|date= 15 December 2010|accessdate= 24 August 2014}}</ref>
