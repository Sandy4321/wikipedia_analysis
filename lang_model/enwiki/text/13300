'''Shlomo Yitzchaki''' ({{lang-he|<U+05E8><U+05D1><U+05D9> <U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05DE><U+05D4> <U+05D9><U+05E6><U+05D7><U+05E7><U+05D9>}}), or in Latin '''Salomon Isaacides''', and today generally known by the acronym '''Rashi''' ({{lang-he|<U+05E8><U+05E9>"<U+05D9>}}, '''RA'''bbi '''SH'''lomo '''I'''tzhaki; February 22, 1040 <U+2013> July 13, 1105), was a [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval French]] [[rabbi]] and author of a comprehensive commentary on the [[Talmud]] and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commentary on the ''Tanakh'']]. Acclaimed for his ability to present the basic meaning of the text in a concise, lucid fashion, Rashi appeals to both learned scholars and beginning students, and his works remain a centerpiece of contemporary Jewish study. His commentary on the Talmud, which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud (a total of 30 tractates), has been included in every edition of the Talmud since its first printing by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in the 1520s. His commentary on Tanach <U+2014> especially his commentary on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ("Five Books of Moses") <U+2014> is an indispensable aid to students of all levels. The later commentary alone serves as the basis for more than 300 "supercommentaries" which analyze Rashi's choice of language and citations, penned by some of the greatest names in rabbinic literature.<ref name="chabad">{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/476620/jewish/Rashis-Method-of-Biblical-Commentary.htm |last=Miller|first=Chaim|title=Rashi's Method of Biblical Commentary|publisher=chabad.org|year=2013}}</ref>

==Name==
Rashi's surname, Yitzhaki, derives from his father's name, Yitzhak. The acronym is sometimes also fancifully expanded as '''Ra'''bban '''Sh'''el '''Y'''Israel which means the rabbi of Israel, or as '''Ra'''bbenu '''SheY'''ichyeh (Our Rabbi, may he live). He may be cited in Hebrew and Aramaic texts as (1) "Shlomo son of Rabbi Yitzhak," (2) "Shlomo son of Yitzhak," (3) "Shlomo Yitzhaki," etc.<ref>''Cybernetics and Systems'' Volume 42, Issue 3, pages 180-197 29 Apr 2011 Available online: {{doi|10.1080/01969722.2011.567893}} article authors Yaakov HaCohen-Kerner, Nadav Schweitzer & Dror Mughaz title ''Automatically Identifying Citations in Hebrew-Aramaic Documents'' published Taylor & Francis "For example, the Pardes book written by Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki, known by the abbreviation Rashi, can be cited using the following patterns: (1) "Shlomo son of Rabbi Yitzhak," (2) "Shlomo son of Yitzhak," (3) "Shlomo Yitzhaki," (4) "In the name of Rashi who wrote in the Pardes"</ref>

In older literature, Rashi is sometimes referred to as ''Jarchi'' or ''Yarhi'' ({{hebrew|<U+05D9><U+05E8><U+05D7><U+05D9>}}), his abbreviated name being interpreted as '''R'''abbi '''Sh'''lomo '''Y'''arhi. This was understood to refer to the Hebrew name of [[Lunel]] in [[Provence]], popularly derived from the French ''lune'' "moon", in Hebrew {{hebrew|<U+05D9><U+05E8><U+05D7>}},<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=xpc9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA74</ref> in which Rashi was assumed to have lived at some time<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=wlMBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA2</ref> or to have been born, or where his ancestors were supposed to have originated.<ref>see for example http://books.google.com/books?id=KyJ44AeJj4sC&pg=PA233 http://books.google.com/books?id=gc4FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA286</ref> [[Richard Simon (priest)|Simon]]<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=3aQUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA545</ref> and [[Johann Christoph Wolf|Wolf]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Johann Christoph |year=1715 |chapter=R.

The evolution of this term has been thoroughly traced.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Nsl2NrA6v6gC&pg=PA1 http://books.google.com/books?id=7DAHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA643</ref>

==Biography==
===Birth and early life===
Rashi was an only child born at [[Troyes]], [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], in northern France, to German Jewish parents from the city of Worms(source: Sefer Avot Atarah Lebanim p. 73). His mother's brother was [[Simon the Elder]], Rabbi of [[Mainz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/rabbinic/infofiles/avotaynu.htm |title=Index to Articles on Rabbinic Genealogy in Avotaynu: The International Review of Jewish Genealogy |accessdate=2008-06-11 |work= Avotaynu: The International Review of Jewish Genealogy }}</ref> Simon was a disciple of [[Rabbeinu Gershom]] Meor HaGolah,<ref>See Rashi's comments in ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 85b.</ref> who died that same year. On his father's side, Rashi has been claimed to be a 33rd generation descendant of [[Yochanan Hasandlar]], who was a fourth-generation descendant of [[Gamaliel the Elder]], who was reputedly descended from the [[Davidic line|royal line of King David]]. In his voluminous writings, Rashi himself made no such claim at all. The main early rabbinical source about his ancestry, Responsum No. 29 by [[Solomon Luria]], makes no such claim either.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hurwitz | first = Simon | authorlink = Solomon Luria | coauthors = | title = The Responsa of Solomon Luria | publisher = | year = 1938 | location = New York, New York | pages = 146<U+2013>151 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Can We Prove Descent from King David?|journal=Avotaynu: the International Review of Jewish Genealogy|year=1992|first=David|last=Einsiedler|coauthors=|volume=VIII|issue=3(Fall) |page=29|id= |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/Rabbinic/journal/descent.htm|accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref>

===Legends===
His fame later made him the subject of many legends. One tradition contends that his parents were childless for many years. Rashi's father, Yitzhak, a poor [[winemaker]], once found a precious jewel and was approached by non-Jews who wished to buy it to adorn their idol. Yitzhak agreed to travel with them to their land, but en route, he cast the gem into the sea. Afterwards he was visited by either the [[Voice of God]] or the prophet [[Elijah]], who told him that he would be rewarded with the birth of a noble son "who would illuminate the world with his Torah knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Legend also states that the couple moved to [[Worms, Germany]] while Rashi's mother was expecting. As she walked down one of the narrow streets in the Jewish quarter, she was imperiled by two oncoming carriages. She turned and pressed herself against a wall, which opened to receive her. This miraculous niche is still visible in the wall of the [[Worms Synagogue]].<ref>Liber, Maurice.   [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KzG4TzOlaVQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rashi#v=onepage&q=&f=false Rashi], Kessinger Publishing, 2004. pg. 18-19. ISBN 1-4191-4396-4</ref>

===Yeshiva studies===
[[Image:V10p325001 Rashi Synagogue.jpg|130px|thumb|[[Rashi Shul|Rashi Synagogue]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]]]
According to tradition, Rashi was first brought to learn Torah by his father on [[Shavuot]] day at the age of five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the [[yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Yaakov ben Yakar]] in Worms, returning to his wife three times yearly, for the [[Days of Awe]], [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]]. When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi]], who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to [[Mainz]], where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] region straddling France and Germany.

Rashi's teachers were students of [[Rabbeinu Gershom]] and Rabbi [[Eliezer Hagadol]], leading Talmudists of the previous generation. From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud as they had been passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmud's unique logic and form of argument. Rashi took concise, copious notes from what he learned in yeshiva, incorporating this material in his commentaries.

===Rosh yeshiva===
He returned to Troyes at the age of 25, after which time his mother died, and he was asked to join the Troyes ''[[Beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). He also began answering [[halakha|halakhic]] questions. Upon the death of the head of the ''Bet din'', Rabbi [[Zerach ben Abraham]], Rashi assumed the court's leadership and answered hundreds of halakhic queries.
[[File:Synagoge Worms 07.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Exterior of Rashi's Synagogue, Worms, Germany]]
In around 1070 he founded a yeshiva which attracted many disciples. It is thought by some that Rashi earned his living as a [[vintner]] since Rashi shows an extensive knowledge of its utensils and process, but there is no evidence for this.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://seforim.blogspot.com/2007/08/mayer-i-gruber-how-did-rashi-make.html |title=How Did Rashi Make a Living? |author=Mayer I. Gruber |unused_data=the Seforim blog}}</ref> Most scholars and a Jewish oral tradition contend that he was a vintner.<ref>http://www.winealign.com/wines/6875-Rashi-Vineyards-Joyvin-White-Kpm</ref><ref>http://www.myjewishlearning.com/texts/Bible/Torah/Commentaries/Rashi.shtml</ref><ref>Maurice Liber, Rashi, trans. Adele Szold (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1906), p 56; Irving Agus, The Heroic Age of Franco-German Jewry (New York: Yeshiva University Press, 1969), 173; Israel S. Elfenbein, "Rashi in His Responsa," in Rashi, His Teachings and Personality, ed. Simon Federbusch (New York: Cultural Division of the World Jewish Congress, 1958), p 67; Salo W. Baron, "Rashi and the Community of Troyes," in Rashi Anniversary Volume, ed. H. L. Ginsberg (New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1941), p 60. "Rashi was a vintner who grew grapes and sold wine."</ref> The only reason given for the centuries old tradition that he was a vintner being not true is that the soil in all of Troyes is not optimal for wine growing grapes, claimed by the research of Rabbi Haym Solevetchik. Earlier references such as a reference to an actual seal from his vineyard <ref>Oxford Bodleian Ms. Oppenheim 276, p. 35a, cited by Grossman, The Early Sages of France, 132; 135, n. 45.</ref> are said not to prove he sold wine just fermented his grapes for his own use.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Although there are many legends about his travels, Rashi likely never went further than from the [[Seine]] to the [[Rhine]]; the utmost limit of his travels were the yeshivas of Lorraine.{{clarify|reason=Lorraine is between the Seine and the Rhine, so how can it be the utmost limit?|date=February 2013}}

In 1096, the [[People's Crusade]] swept through the Lorraine, murdering 12,000 Jews and uprooting whole communities. Among those murdered in Worms were the three sons of Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, Rashi's teacher. Rashi wrote several ''[[Selichot]]'' (penitential poems) mourning the slaughter and the destruction of the region's great yeshivot. Seven of Rashi's ''Selichot'' still exist, including ''Adonai Elohei Hatz'vaot"'', which is recited on the eve of [[Rosh Hashanah]], and ''Az Terem Nimtehu'', which is recited on the [[Fast of Gedalia]].

===Death and burial site===
[[File:Rashi statue in troyes.jpg|thumb|Monument in memory of Rashi in [[Troyes]], France]]

Rashi died on July 13, 1105 ([[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] 29, 4865) aged 65. He was buried in Troyes. The approximate location of the cemetery in which he was buried was recorded in ''[[Seder ha-Dorot|Seder Hadoros]]'', but over time the location of the cemetery was forgotten. A number of years ago, a [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] professor discovered an ancient map depicting the site of the cemetery, which now lay under an open square in the city of Troyes. After this discovery, French Jews erected a large monument in the center of the square<U+2014>a large, black and white globe featuring a prominent [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] letter, ''[[Shin (letter)|Shin]]'' (<U+05E9>) (presumably for "Shlomo", Rashi's name). The granite base of the monument is engraved: ''Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki <U+2014> Commentator and Guide''.

In 2005, [[Yisroel Meir Gabbai]] erected an additional plaque at this site marking the square as a burial ground. The plaque reads: "''The place you are standing on is the cemetery of the town of Troyes. Many [[Rishonim]] are buried here, among them Rabbi Shlomo, known as Rashi the holy, may his merit protect us''".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chareidi.org/archives5765/mattos/MTS65features.htm |title=The Discovery of the Resting Places of Rashi and the Baalei Hatosfos |author=Y. Friedman| publisher=Dei'ah Vedibur |date=2005-07-25}}</ref>

===Descendants===
{{main|Rashi's daughters}}
Rashi had no sons, but his three daughters, Miriam, Yocheved, and Rachel, all married Talmudic scholars. Legends exist that Rashi's daughters put on [[tefillin]]. While some women in medieval Ashkenaz did wear tefillin, there is no evidence that Rashi's daughters did so.<ref>Grossman, Avraham. ''Pious and Rebellious: Jewish Women in Medieval Europe''. Brandeis University Press, 2004.)</ref>

*Rashi's oldest daughter, Yocheved, married [[Meir ben Shmuel]]; their four sons were: Shmuel ([[Rashbam]]) (b. 1080), Yitzchak ([[Rivam]]) (b. 1090), Jacob ([[Rabbeinu Tam]]) (b. 1100), and Shlomo the Grammarian, who were among the most prolific of the ''[[List of Tosafists|Baalei Tosafot]]'', leading rabbinic authorities who wrote critical and explanatory glosses on the Talmud which appear opposite Rashi's commentary on every page of the Talmud. Yocheved's daughter, Chanah, was a teacher of laws and customs relevant to women.
*Rashi's middle daughter, Miriam, married [[Judah ben Nathan]], who completed the commentary on Talmud [[Makkot]] which Rashi was working on when he died.<ref>[[s:he:<U+05DE><U+05DB><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05D9><U+05D8> <U+05D1>#<U+05E8><U+05E9>"<U+05D9>|Makkot 19b]]: "Our master's body was pure, and his soul departed in purity, and he did not explain any more; from here on is the language of his student Rabbi Yehudah ben Nathan."</ref> Their daughter Alvina was a learned woman whose customs served as the basis for later halakhic decisions. Their son [[Yom Tov ben Judah of Paris|Yom Tov]] later moved to Paris and headed a yeshiva there, along with his brothers Shimshon and Eliezer.
*Rashi's youngest daughter, Rachel, married (and divorced) Eliezer ben Shemiah.

==Works==
===Commentary on the Tanach===
[[Image:Sapirstein Rashi.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern translation of Rashi's commentary on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]], published by [[Artscroll]]]]
Rashi's commentary on the Tanakh <U+2014> and especially his commentary on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] <U+2014> is the essential companion for any study of the Talmud at any level. Drawing on the breadth of Midrashic, Talmudic and [[aggadata|Aggadic]] literature (including literature that is no longer extant), as well as his knowledge of grammar, halakhah, and how things work, Rashi clarifies the "simple" meaning of the text so that a bright child of five could understand it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org.il/Magazines/Article.asp?ArticleID=3822&CategoryID=957 |title=<U+05E8><U+05D1><U+05DF> <U+05E9><U+05DC> <U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05DC> (Hebrew) |author=Mordechai Menashe Laufer}}</ref> At the same time, his commentary forms the foundation for some of the most profound legal analysis and mystical discourses that came after it. Scholars debate why Rashi chose a particular Midrash to illustrate a point, or why he used certain words and phrases and not others. Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] wrote that "Rashi<U+2019>s commentary on Torah is the <U+2018>wine of Torah<U+2019>. It opens the heart and uncovers one<U+2019>s essential love and fear of G-d."<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/476620/jewish/Rashis-Method-of-Biblical-Commentary.htm Rashi's Method of Biblical Commentary]</ref>

Scholars believe that Rashi's commentary on the Torah grew out of the lectures he gave to his students in his yeshiva, and evolved with the questions and answers they raised on it. Rashi only completed this commentary in the last years of his life. It was immediately accepted as authoritative by all Jewish communities, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] alike.

The first dated Hebrew printed book was Rashi's commentary on the Chumash, printed by Abraham ben Garton in [[Reggio di Calabria]], [[Italy]], 18 February 1475. (This version did not include the text of the Chumash itself.)

Rashi wrote commentaries on all the books of Tanakh except [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles I & II]]. Scholars believe that the commentary which appears under Rashi's name in those books was compiled by the students of Rabbi Saadiah of the Rhine, who incorporated material from Rashi's yeshiva. Rashi's students, Rabbi Shemaya and Rabbi Yosef, edited the final commentary on the Torah; some of their own notes and additions also made their way into the version we have today.

Today, tens of thousands of men, women and children study "Chumash with Rashi" as they review the Torah portion to be read in [[synagogue]] on the upcoming [[Shabbat]]. According to [[halakha]], a man may even study the Rashi on each Torah verse in fulfillment of the requirement to review the [[Parsha]] twice with Targum (which normally refers to [[Targum Onkelos]]) This practice is called in Hebrew: "[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]". Since its publication, Rashi's commentary on the Torah is standard in almost all Chumashim produced within the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community.

Rabbi [[Mordechai Leifer]] of [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]] said that anyone who learns the weekly [[Parsha]] together with the commentary by Rashi every week, is guaranteed to sit in the [[Yeshiva]] (school) of Rashi in the Afterlife.<ref>Yiddeshe Licht Vol 31 Number 15 Page 14 (Hebrew Text) http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=27185&st=&pgnum=22</ref>

===Commentary on the Talmud===
[[File:Rashi's Talmud Commentary.jpg|250px|thumb|right|An early printing of the Talmud ([[Ta'anit]] 9b); Rashi's commentary is at the bottom of the right column, continuing for a few lines into the left column.]]
Rashi wrote the first comprehensive [[Talmud#Commentaries|commentary on the Talmud]]. Rashi's commentary, drawing on his knowledge of the entire contents of the Talmud, attempts to provide a full explanation of the words and of the logical structure of each Talmudic passage. Unlike other commentators, Rashi does not paraphrase or exclude any part of the text, but elucidates phrase by phrase. Often he provides punctuation in the unpunctuated text, explaining, for example, "This is a question"; "He says this in surprise," "He repeats this in agreement," etc.

As in his commentary on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates the meaning of the text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or [[Aramaic]] words into the spoken [[French language]] of his day, giving latter-day scholars a window into the vocabulary and pronunciation of [[Old French]].

Rashi exerted a decisive influence on establishing the correct text of the Talmud. Up to and including his age, texts of each Talmudic tractate were copied by hand and circulated in yeshivas. Errors often crept in: sometimes a copyist would switch words around, and other times incorporate a student's marginal notes into the main text. Because of the large number of merchant-scholars who came from throughout the Jewish world to attend the great fairs in Troyes, Rashi was able to compare different manuscripts and readings in [[Tosefta]], [[Jerusalem Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Targum]], and the writings of the [[Geonim]], and determine which readings should be preferred. However, in his humility, he deferred to scholars who disagreed with him. For example, in [[Kodashim|Chulin]] 4a, he comments about a phrase, "We do not read this. But as for those who do, this is the explanation..."

Rashi's commentary, which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud (a total of 30 tractates), has been included in every version of the Talmud since its first printing in the fifteenth century. It is always situated towards the middle of the opened book display; i.e., on the side of the page closest to the binding.

Some of the other printed commentaries which are attributed to Rashi were composed by others, primarily his students. In some commentaries, the text indicates that Rashi died before completing the tractate, and that it was completed by a student. This is true of the tractate Makkot, the concluding portions of which were composed by his son-in-law, Rabbi Judah ben Nathan, and of the tractate [[Bava Batra]], finished (in a more detailed style) by his grandson, the Rashbam. There is a legend that the commentary on Nedarim, which is clearly not his, was actually composed by his daughters.

===Responsa===
About 300 of Rashi's [[responsa]] and halakhic decisions are extant. These responsa were copied and preserved by his students. ''Siddur Rashi'', compiled by an unknown student, also contains Rashi's responsa on prayer. Other compilations include ''Sefer Hapardes'', edited by Rabbi Shemayah, Rashi's student, and ''Sefer Haoraah'', prepared by Rabbi Nathan Hamachiri.

===Influence in non-Jewish circles===
Rashi also influenced non-Jewish circles. His commentaries on the Bible circulated in many different communities especially his commentaries on the Pentateuch. In the 12th-17th centuries, Rashi's influence spread from French and German provinces to Spain and the east. He had a tremendous influence on Christian scholars. The French monk Nicolas de Lyre of Manjacoria, who was known as the "ape of Rashi",<ref name="Skolnik, Fred 2007">Skolnik, Fred, and Michael Berenbaum. "Rashi." Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Vol. 17. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA in Association with the Keter Pub. House, 2007.</ref> was dependent on Rashi when writing the 'Postillae Perpetuate' on the Bible. He believed that Rashi's commentaries were the "official repository of Rabbinical tradition".<ref name=solomon>{{cite web |title=Rashi (Solomon Bar Issac)|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com. |date=27 February 2013|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12585-rashi-solomon-bar-isaac}}</ref> and significant to understanding the Bible. De Lyre also had great influence on [[Martin Luther]]. Rashi's commentaries became significant to [[Humanism|humanists]] at this time who studied grammar and exegesis. Christian Hebraists studied Rashi's commentaries as important interpretations "authorized by the Synagogue".<ref name=solomon/>

Rashi's influence grew the most in the 15th century; from the 17th century onwards, his commentaries were translated into many other languages. Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch was known as the first printed Hebrew work. Many of his works were translated into English by M. Rosenbaum and A.M. Silbermann in London from 1929-1934. Although Rashi had an influence on communities outside of Judaism, his lack of connection to science prevented him from entering the general domain and he remained more popular among the Jewish community.<ref name="Skolnik, Fred 2007"/><ref name=solomon/>

===Criticism of Rashi===
Although Rashi<U+2019>s interpretations were widely respected, there are many who criticize his work. After the 12th century, criticism on Rashi's commentaries became common on Jewish works such as the Talmud. The criticisms mainly dealt with difficult passages. Generally Rashi provides the ''pshat'' or literal meaning of Jewish texts, while his disciples known as the Tosafot, criticized his work and gave more interpretative descriptions of the texts.  The Tosafot's commentaries can be found in Jewish texts opposite Rashi<U+2019>s commentary. The Tosafot added comments and criticism in places where Rashi had not added comments. The Tosafot went beyond the passage itself in search of arguments, parallels, and distinctions that could be drawn out. This addition to Jewish texts was seen as causing a <U+201C>major cultural product<U+201D> <ref name="Bloomberg, Jon 2004">Bloomberg, Jon. The Jewish World in the Modern Age. Jersey City, NJ: KTAV Pub. House, 2004. 69.</ref> which became an important part of Torah study.<ref>"Tosafot." JewishEncyclopedia.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Feb. 2013. <http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14457-tosafot>.</ref><ref name="Bloomberg, Jon 2004"/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Raschihaus.jpg|thumb|200px|''Raschihaus'', Jewish Museum, Worms, Germany.]]
Rashi's commentary on the Talmud continues to be a key basis for contemporary rabbinic scholarship and interpretation. Without Rashi's commentary, the Talmud would have remained a closed book.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} With it, any student who has been introduced to its study by a teacher can continue learning on his own, deciphering its language and meaning with the aid of Rashi.

The [[ArtScroll#Schottenstein Edition Talmud|Schottenstein Edition interlinear translation of the Talmud]] bases its English-language commentary primarily on Rashi, and describes his continuing importance as follows: {{quote|It has been our policy throughout the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud to give Rashi's interpretation as the primary explanation of the [[Gemara]]. Since it is not possible in a work of this nature to do justice to all of the [[Rishonim]], we have chosen to follow the commentary most learned by people, and the one studied first by virtually all Torah scholars. In this we have followed the ways of our teachers and the Torah masters of the last nine hundred years, who have assigned a pride of place to Rashi's commentary and made it a point of departure for all other commentaries.<ref>''The Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud:Talmud Bavli:Tractate Nedarim.

(Note: The Schottenstein Edition editors explained further that they chose [[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]]'s commentary for [[Nedarim (tractate)|Tractate Nedarim]] as an exception, based on a belief that the commentary attributed to Rashi for this tractate was not written by Rashi)</ref>}}

In 2006, the [[Jewish National and University Library]] at [[Hebrew University]] put on an exhibit commemorating the 900th anniversary of Rashi's death (2005), showcasing rare items from the library collection written by Rashi, as well as various works by others concerning Rashi.

==Supercommentaries==
Voluminous supercommentaries have been published on Rashi's commentaries on the Bible and Talmud, including ''Gur Aryeh'' by Rabbi [[Judah Loew]] (the Maharal), ''Sefer ha-Mizrachi'' by Rabbi [[Elijah Mizrachi]] (the Re'em), and ''Yeri'ot Shlomo'' by Rabbi [[Solomon Luria]] (the Maharshal). Almost all [[rabbinic literature]] published since the [[Middle Ages]] discusses Rashi, either using his view as supporting evidence or debating against it.

Rashi's explanations of the Chumash were also cited extensively in ''Postillae Perpetuae'' by [[Nicholas de Lyra]] (1292<U+2013>1340), a French [[Franciscan]]. De Lyra's book was one of the primary sources that was used in Luther's translation of the Bible.

The semi-cursive typeface in which Rashi's commentaries are printed both in the Talmud and Tanakh is often referred to as "'''Rashi script'''." This does not mean that Rashi himself used such a script: the typeface is based on a 15th-century Sephardic semi-cursive hand.  What would be called "Rashi script" was employed by early Hebrew typographers such as the [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=966&letter=S&search=soncino Soncino family] and [[Daniel Bomberg]], a [[Christian]] printer in [[Venice]], in their editions of commented texts (such as the [[Mikraot Gedolot]] and the [[Talmud]], in which Rashi's commentaries prominently figure) to distinguish the rabbinic commentary from the primary text proper, for which a square typeface was used.
