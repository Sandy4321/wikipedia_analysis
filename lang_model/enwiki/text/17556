'''The New England Primer''' was first published between 1688 and 1690 by English printer [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]], who had come to Boston in Massachusetts in 1686 to escape the brief Catholic ascendancy under James II. Based largely upon his earlier  ''The Protestant Tutor'', ''The New-England Primer'' was the first reading [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] designed for the American Colonies. It became the most successful educational [[textbook]] published in colonial and the early days of [[History of the United States|United States history]]. While the selections in the New England Primer varied somewhat across time there was standard content for beginning reading instruction. Included were the alphabet, vowels, consonants, double letters and syllabariums of two letters to six letter syllables. The 90-page work contained religious maxims, woodcuts, alphabetical assistants, [[acronyms]], catechisms, and moral lessons.  Many of its selections were drawn from the [[King James Version of the Bible]] and others were original. It embodied the dominant [[Puritan]] attitude and [[worldview]] of the day. Among the topics discussed are respect to parental figures, sin, and [[Salvation]]. Some versions contained the [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]; others contained John Cotton's shorter catechism, known as [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/etas/18/ Milk for Babes]; and some contained both. The primer remained in print well into the [[19th century]] and was even used until the 20th. A reported 2 million copies were sold in the 1700s. No copies of editions before 1727 are known to survive; earlier editions are known only from publishers' and booksellers' advertisements.

Two of the most famous example verses are as follows:



:''Now I lay me down to sleep, <br>
:''I pray thee, Lord, my soul to keep;''<br>
:''If I should die before I wake,''<br>
:''I pray thee, Lord, my soul to take.'' 

<U+2014>1784 ed.

:''In [[The Fall of Man|Adam's Fall]], <br>
:''we sinned all.''
