'''Operation Excess''' was a series of [[United Kingdom|British]] supply convoys to [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Greece]] in January 1941.  The operation encountered the first presence of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' anti-shipping aircraft in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  All the convoyed freighters reached their destinations.  The destroyer ''Gallant'' was lost to Italian mines; and Axis bombers destroyed the cruiser ''Southampton'', and put the aircraft carrier ''Illustrious'' out of operation for nearly a year.

==Background==
[[Italy]]'s declaration of War on 10 June 1940 brought [[World War II]] to the Mediterranean Sea and placed the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' astride England's traditional sea route to [[Indian Ocean]] ports, while the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' roughly tripled the numbers of [[battleship]]s, [[cruiser]]s, and [[submarine]]s available to challenge British sea power.  The [[Royal Navy]] had been prepared to defend the eastern Mediterranean so long as [[France]] could control the western Mediterranean, but the [[Second Armistice at Compi<U+00E8>gne]] removed the French navy from the alliance on 25 June 1940.  From bases at [[Gibraltar]] and Alexandria the Royal Navy attempted to convoy supplies to sustain Malta as a base in the central Mediterranean.  As Italy attacked [[Egypt]] from [[Libya]] in September 1940 and Greece from [[Albania]] in October 1940, the Royal Navy maintained most of their [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] at Alexandria while [[Force H]] at Gibraltar was used for raids.  Early November 1940 successes including halting the Italian offensive in Greece and disabling Italian battleships ''[[Italian battleship Littorio|Littorio]]'', ''[[Italian battleship Conte di Cavour|Conte di Cavour]]'' and ''[[Italian battleship Caio Duilio|Caio Duilio]]'' at the [[Battle of Taranto]] provided incentive and opportunity to resupply Malta and Greece.<ref name="p&n">Potter & Nimitz pp.521-527</ref>

==Preparations==
===Allied=== 
'''Convoy MC 4:'''  Four freighters waited at Gibraltar.

===Axis===
Five hundred anti-shipping aircraft of ''[[X. Fliegerkorps]]'' were being transferred from [[Norway]] to [[Sicily]] to protect Axis convoys to North Africa and prevent passage of British convoys to Malta.<ref name="p&n"/>

==Sequence of events==
[[File:SM79 193.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Royal Navy personnel accustomed to these ''Regia Aeronautica'' SM.79s were surprised by the intensity of ''X Fliegerkorps'' operations encountered during Operation Excess.<ref name="emws">Bartimeus pp.56-61</ref>]]
===6 January 1941===
Convoy MC 4 left Gibraltar feinting toward the [[Atlantic]] before turning toward Malta after darkness concealed them from the view of Axis agents near Gibraltar.<ref name="g&m"/>

===7 January===
Force H sailed from Gibraltar to cover convoy MC 4.  Force A, Force D, and convoy MW 5 with Force C sailed from Alexandria,<ref name="hague"/> and Force B sailed from the Aegean toward Malta.  Force A was located by Italian air reconnaissance that afternoon.<ref name="r&h"/>

===8 January===
Force B landed its passengers in Malta and proceeded west to meet convoy MC 4.<ref name="r&h"/>  [[Vickers Wellington]]s bombed [[Naples]] damaging ''[[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|Giulio Cesare]]'' with three near misses<ref name="g&m"/> and causing the only operational Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' to retreat from the approaching convoys.<ref name="p&n"/>

===9 January===
Force A was joined by Force D and {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} 210 nautical miles southeast of Malta.  Force B joined convoy MC 4.  Convoy MC 4 and Force H were discovered by Italian aircraft and attacked unsuccessfully by ten [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|SM.79]]s from Sardinia.  Two SM.79s were shot down by [[Fairey Fulmar]]s from ''Ark Royal''.  A later attack by 15 [[Fiat CR.42]]s carrying 100kg bombs was similarly ineffective.  Force H left convoy MC 4 that afternoon after ''Ark Royal'' launched six Swordfish for the defense of Malta.  Force A joined convoy MC 4 at dusk.<ref name="g&m"/>

===10 January===
Italian ships from [[La Spezia]] searched unsuccessfully for Force H.<ref name="p&n"/>  Italian submarine ''Settimo'' and [[torpedo boat]]s ''Circe'' and ''Vega'' launched torpedoes unsuccessfully against convoy MC 4.<ref name="r&h"/>  ''Bonaventure'' and ''Hereward'' sank ''Vega'' six miles south of [[Pantellaria]] at 0830.  ''Circe'' escaped undamaged.  ''Bonaventure'' sustained some damage and two of her complement were killed.  She spent 75 per cent of her ammunition in the engagement.<ref>Woodman p.113</ref>  Two of ''Vega''{{'s}} crew survived.<ref name="brown">Brown pp.40&41</ref>

''Gallant'' struck a [[naval mine]] at 0835.<ref name="brown"/>  The bow was destroyed<ref name="emws"/> and 65 men were killed.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-25G-Gallant.htm HMS Gallant (H 59)]</ref>  ''Mowhawk'' took ''Gallant'' in tow toward Malta while the Force B cruisers provided protection from air attacks.<ref name="emws"/>  Convoys MC 4 and MW 5 arrived at Malta and convoy ME 6 departed for Alexandria.<ref name="hague"/>  
[[File:Junkers Ju 87Bs in flight c1941.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Few ships survived dive bombing attacks of the intensity ''Illustrious'' endured from these Ju87 ''Stukas''.]]
Fulmars from ''Illustrious'' shot down an Italian aircraft shadowing Force A at 0930.  ''Valiant'' avoided torpedoes launched by two SM.79s approaching under the [[RADAR]] horizon at 1230.<ref name="emws"/>  As the combat air patrol Fulmars dropped altitude to engage the SM.79s, Force A was attacked at 1235 by 18 [[Heinkel He 111|He111s]] of [[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG 26]] and 43 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju87s]] of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 1|StG 1]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2|StG 2]]<ref name="r&h"/> escorted by 10 [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf110s]] of [[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 26|ZG 26]].<ref>Wood & Gunston p.33</ref>  ''Illustrious'' completed launching relief Fulmar and Swordfish patrollers as the attack developed.  ''Illustrious'' was the main target and was enveloped in waterspouts and mist of exploding bombs.  Some bombers diving from an altitude of 12,000 feet delayed bomb release until their pullout altitude was lower than the height of ''Illustrious''{{'}} funnel.  The five air patrol Fulmars had not returned from chasing the SM.79s which attacked ''Valiant''; and the four recently launched Fulmars were unable to gain altitude rapidly enough to break up the attack.  The Fulmars claimed eight enemy aircraft downed during the continuing air strikes against Force A as they shuttled to Malta airfields to refuel and re-arm.<ref name="emws"/>  ''Warspite'' was lightly damaged by a single bomb.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-01BB-Warspite.htm HMS Warspite]</ref>  ''Illustrious'' was hit by five bombs, including one which failed to explode; and a near miss disabled her rudder mechanism.  A bomb striking a lowered elevator caused extensive hangar damage with many casualties among aircraft maintenance personnel and destroyed nine Swordfish and five Fulmars.  At 1530 ''Illustrious'' headed for Malta steering with engines.  The bombing attacks continued.  Seven SM.79s were discouraged by heavy anti-aircraft fire, but an attack by six Italian Ju87s at 1600 scored another bomb hit and two near misses.  Fourteen German Ju87s missed ''Valiant'' and ''Janus'' and a later attack by 14 He111s was similarly ineffective.  ''Illustrious'' reached Malta at 2130 with 126 dead and 91 wounded.<ref name="g&m"/>

===11 January===
''Gallant'' was beached in Malta's Grand Harbor at dawn<ref name="emws"/> but never repaired.<ref name="brown"/>  As ''Mohawk'' and the Force B cruisers steamed from Malta to rejoin Force A, they were surprised by 12 Ju-87R dive bombers of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader_2|II/St.G.2]] <ref>Pegg, p.12</ref><ref>Smith, p.101</ref> attacking out of the sun at 1520.  ''Gloucester'' was hit by a bomb which failed to explode; and ''Southampton'' was hit by two bombs killing 80 men and starting fires requiring the ship to be scuttled 180 miles east of Malta.<ref name="brown"/>  Force H returned to Gibraltar.<ref name="r&h"/>

===12 January===
Force A was reinforced west of [[Crete]] by Force B, the cruisers of Force D, and {{HMS|Barham|04|6}} and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} from Alexandria.<ref name="r&h"/>

===13 January===
Convoy ME 6 arrived at Alexandria.<ref name="hague"/>

==''Illustrious Blitz''==
What Maltese called the ''Illustrious Blitz'' began when bomb stocks depleted during the attacks of 10 and 11 January were replenished and the Axis made a concerted effort to destroy ''Illustrious'' before she could be repaired.  ''Illustrious'' and ''Essex'' were hit by an air raid on 16 January.  Ten [[Macchi C.202]]s, ten CR.42s and twenty Bf110s escorted 44 Ju87s.  Bombs exploding in Grand Harbor killed numerous fish collected after the raid and eaten by the besieged Maltese.<ref name="g&m"/>  ''Illustrious'' was not seriously damaged,<ref name="emws"/> but a bomb exploded in ''Essex''{{'s}} engine room killing 15 men and wounding 23 more.  There was another heavy air raid on 17 January,<ref name="g&m"/> and ''Illustrious'' was again hit by an air raid on 18 January.<ref name="emws"/>  ''Illustrious'' was not damaged by the final major attack on 19 January.<ref name="g&m"/>  ''Illustrious'' departed Malta on 23 January; but her Fulmars remained for the defense of the island.<ref name="p&n"/>  ''Illustrious'' was able to complete additional repairs after reaching Alexandria on 25 January,<ref name="g&m"/> but restoration of full combat effectiveness required a trip to United States shipyards.<ref>Pack p.17</ref>

==Losses==
Fairey Fulmar fighters and AA gunners of the Royal Navy shot down at least seven aircraft on 10 January 1941, in defence of ''HMS Illustrious'', while one Fulmar was lost.<ref>''The Italian Navy in WW2'', Sadkovich, p114, states that 5 German and 2 Italian aircraft were shot down,while 2 FAA aircraft were lost.</ref><ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p. 10, states that Fulmars shot down 5 aircraft while AA shot down 3 more and one Fulmar was lost.</ref>  No merchantmen were lost during ''Excess'' but the Royal Navy lost one cruiser sunk, another damaged, and a destroyer damaged beyond repair.<ref>''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys''</ref>
