'''Osborne Theomun Olsen''' ([[June 9]], [[1883]] &ndash; [[January 9]], [[1971]]) was the owner of Osborne Art Studios in [[Chicago]], Illinois, which existed from 1910 to 1973. <!-- Social Security Number 327304556 --> <ref name=obit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Osborne Olsen |url= |quote= |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=[[January 11]], [[1971]] |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite book |last=Harran  |first=Jim |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Collectible Cups & Saucers |year=2000 |publisher= |quote= | url= |isbn=1574321552 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homeandgardentv.com/hgtv/ah_antique_porcelain_china/article/0,1801,HGTV_3091_1378591,00.html |title=A Plate With a Past |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=That distinction goes to the Osborne Art Studios, which was founded in Chicago, Ill., in 1910 by Osborne T. Olsen. At that time there were a number of companies decorating white china "blanks" (e.g. pieces that are undecorated and therefore "blank") in Chicago. The most famous of these was and is the Pickard China Company, whose work is highly prized by current collectors and can be very expensive. There is no question that Osborne did beautiful work, but he is often accused of being a Pickard copyist, and this tends to hurt the value of many Osborne pieces. It should also be noted that Osborne did not always use a backstamp on his pieces, and since they look so much like Pickard's work, this has caused much confusion among those who are interested in this type of ware.  |publisher=[[HGTV]] }}</ref>


==Biography==
Osborne <ref>Osborne T. Olsen's name was erroneously thought to be "Osborne Titaman Olsen" by his descendants. It was found written in the World War I draft registration as "Osborne Theomun Olsen". This was discovered in 2006.</ref> was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to Anna Maria Jensen (1854-c1895) and Peter Olsen (1844-1892) of Farsund, Norway. <ref>His birth certificate incorrectly lists him as "Oscar Olson", and lists his parents as "Annie Jenshon Olson", age 29, and "Peter Olson", age 39, of Farsund, Norway. </ref> Osborne had the following siblings: Jennie Olsen (1881-?) who married a Henning and may have been buried in Mount Olive Cemetery; Perry Olsen (1885-1971) who died in Oakland, California; and Harriet Olsen (1889-?). <ref name=obit/>

Both of Osborne's parents were dead by 1900 and the four children went to live with their widowed aunt: Johanna Katrine Jensen (1857-1946), who was born in [[Farsund, Norway]] and had been married to Steffen Barca. Katherine had two children: Henry Barca (1886-1961) and Leo Barca (1887-1924). In 1900 Osborne was already working as a decorator. <ref>[[1900 US Census]] for [[Chicago, Illinois]]</ref> By 1911 he was a member of the Art Institute of Chicago. <ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Art Institute of Chicago Annual Report |year=1911 |publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]] |quote= | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IWUEAAAAYAAJ&dq |isbn= }}</ref>
<!-- Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) says: He was not buried with his parents so I don't have a death date yet for them  -->

Osborne married Augusta Schmidt (1883-1974) on [[June 3]], [[1905]], in Chicago and had the following children: Perry Olsen (1907-1974) who married Lavina Minnie Price (1909-1989); and Evelyn Olsen (1909-2002) who married Wilbur Lamond (1912-1983). In 1910 he was using the name "Asbjorn T. Olsen" <ref>He registered for the draft on [[September 18]], [[1918]] under the name "Osborne Theomun Olsen". He listed his job as "china painting" at 2520 North Milwaukee Avenue. He had blue eyes and brown hair, and did not serve in [[World War I]].</ref>

==  Osborne Art Studio  ==
Osborne owned Osborne Art Studio in Chicago (sometimes written as "Osbourne Art Studio") which decorated [[porcelain]] and other ceramics. He bought undecorated porcelain from [[Hutschenreuther]] and other manufacturers which he then decorated and the fired.
Alan B. Reed in the ''Collector's Encyclopedia of Pickard China'' writes:
<blockquote>
He Anglicized his first name early in his career, and by age 18 [in 1902] he was already decorating china professionally. In 1905 he married a girl his own age and they had two children, a boy and a girl. During the first seven or eight years of his career, he probably worked for one or more of the decorator wholesalers such as Pitkin & Brooks. Several antique dealers have insisted that he received his early training at Pickard. While not discounting these claims, diligent searches at antique shows and auctions and among private collections have turned up no example. Certainly, he was not one of Pickard's top artists nor was he ever Pickard's art director as a few dealers have claimed. By the time of the [[Media:1910 census olsen.gif|1910 Census]] [under the name 'Asbjorn T. Olsen'] he describes himself as 'working on his own account', that is, he had his own china-decorating business in his home, and by 1914 he had opened a separate studio at 2520 North [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]]. Osborne did not use a backstamp on much of his product, being content to sign his name on the face of the piece, or in the case of all-over gold pieces, to scribe his signature on the bottom, In other cases, he used gummed foil labels that were easily removed after purchase. Therefore although he did employ other artists one cannot distinguish between unstamped pieces signed by an artist while working for Osborne and pieces which that artist may have made on a freelance basis. He does not seem to have encouraged - or perhaps even permitted - other artists to sign their work for him. An Osborne piece signed by anyone other than Osborne has yet to be found. Although he seems to have been devoted primarily to decorated china, he always characterized his studio as an 'art studio' and himself as simply an 'artist'. The studio was not a large one, and inasmuch as Osborne sold art supplies as well as decorated china from a store at the front of the building, he probably employed no more than six or eight china decorators at the studio's height. Nevertheless, he did employ some very good artists.
