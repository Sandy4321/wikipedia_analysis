'''Scipione Piattoli''' (1749<U+2013>1809) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|priest]] who was politically active in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], during the [[Four-Year Sejm]] (1788<U+2013>92) and participated in the drafting of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]].<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'' ([[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 3, p. 505.</ref> 

==Life==
Piattoli arrived in Poland in 1783.  In 1789 he collaborated with [[Ignacy Potocki]], helping draft many texts connected with Potocki's work in the [[Sejm]] (the [[legislature]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]).<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref> 

Piattoli won the confidence of Poland's King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]] and participated in the drafting of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]].<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref> 

In 1790<U+2013>92 he was sent on secret [[diplomatic mission]]s.<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref> 

In 1804<U+2013>5, after the final [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], he worked closely with [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], the ''de facto'' [[Russian Imperial]] [[foreign minister]], in [[St. Petersburg]].<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref>  

Piattoli co-authored a plan for a [[Europe]]an organization of states intended to prevent [[armed conflict]]s and maintain [[peace]].<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref>  

Toward the end of his life, Piattoli settled in [[Courland]] and abandoned the priesthood.<ref>"Piattoli, Scipione," ''Encyklopedia powszechna [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]]'', vol. 3, p. 505.</ref>

==Constitution==
Piattoli, as [[private secretary]] to King [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]] and a resident of the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in [[Warsaw]], has been credited with having won the King over to the idea of [[social reform]]s and with having played a role in the drafting of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]].<ref>[[J<U+00F3>zef Kasparek|Joseph Kasparek]], ''The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States: Kinships and Genealogy'', p. 31.</ref>

The exact nature of Piattoli's role in regard to the Constitution remains uncertain.  By some accounts, it was Father Piattoli who won the King over to collaboration with the leaders of the [[Patriotic Party]] on drafting a constitution.  In some accounts, he prepared drafts of the document, based on discussions among the principal authors, including the King, [[Hugo Ko<U+0142><U+0142><U+0105>taj]] (another politically active [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]) and [[Ignacy Potocki]].  In one version, Piattoli actually drew up the document.  At a minimum, he seems to have helped catalyze the process.<ref>[[J<U+00F3>zef Kasparek|Joseph Kasparek]], ''The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States'', p. 31.</ref>
