'''King's Highway 51''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 51''', was a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] that connected [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] in [[Eatonville, Ontario|Eatonville]] with [[Rondeau Provincial Park]]. An earlier [[Route number|designation]] existed south of [[Orangeville, Ontario|Orangeville]], connecting [[Ontario Highway 24|Highway&nbsp;24]] with [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway&nbsp;10]]. This iteration was assumed in 1938, but later renumbered as Highway&nbsp;24 In 1961. The more recent incarnation of the route number was assumed in 1970, but then decommissioned in 1997 and transferred to what is now the city of [[Chatham<U+2013>Kent]].

== Route description ==
Highway&nbsp;51 is a short connector road that served to link Highway&nbsp;3 to Rondeau Provincial Park. At its southern terminus, the highway began at the entrance gates to the provincial park, proceeding northeast through a small community of recreational [[cottage]]s. The highway exited the park and turned north onto what is now Chatham<U+2013>Kent Road&nbsp;15. From here the highway progressed straight north to Highway&nbsp;3, passing through the community of [[New Scotland, Chatham-Kent, Ontario|New Scotland]] along the way.<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map
