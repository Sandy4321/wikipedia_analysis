The '''trade dollar''' was a [[Dollar coin (United States)|United States dollar coin]] minted to compete with other large silver coins that were already popular in the [[Orient]]. The idea first came about in the 1860s, when the price of silver began to decline due to increased [[Silver mining in the United States|mining efforts]] in the [[western United States]]. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before [[United States Congress|Congress]], where it was approved and later signed into law as the [[Coinage Act of 1873]]. The act made trade dollars [[legal tender]] up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an [[obverse and reverse]] created by [[William Barber (engraver)|William Barber]] were selected. 

The coins were first struck in 1873, and most of the production was sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those who were given them in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of [[business strike]]s ended in 1878, though the mintage of [[proof coin]]s continued until 1883. The trade dollar was remonetized when the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] was signed into law.

== Background ==

[[File:John Jay Knox - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|John Jay Knox popularized the idea of a dollar coin to compete with the Mexican dollar for use in the Orient.]]

Following the [[California gold rush]] that began in 1849 and the [[Australian gold rush]] that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into commerce than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels.<ref name="goldrush">Bowers, p. 869.</ref> This resulted in a decrease in the value of gold and an increase in the value of silver.<ref name="goldrush"/> As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting.<ref name="goldrush"/> In response, Congress authorized the [[United States Mint|Mint]] to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the [[three-cent piece (United States coin)|three-cent piece]] and [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]].<ref name="goldrush"/> Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose and the price decreased.<ref name="silver">Bowers, p. 870.</ref> During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by paper and copper currency.<ref name="silver"/> 

In China, the [[Mexican peso]] (successor to the [[Spanish dollar]]) was greatly valued in commerce.  However, the Chinese were sensitive to any changes in the coin's design, and were reluctant to accept newer coins due to a minor design change.  The American silver dollar, {{convert|7.5|gr|g}} lighter than its Spanish counterpart, was unpopular in the Orient due to its light weight, forcing American merchants to purchase the Spanish or Mexican pieces to use in trade.<ref name = "t251">Taxay, p. 251.</ref> Beginning in 1866, during the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]], the design was changed to show the Emperor's portrait; this caused widespread nonacceptance of the coins in China.<ref>Bowers, p. 945.</ref> 

While conducting an investigation of the [[San Francisco Mint|Mint at San Francisco]], deputy comptroller of the currency [[John Jay Knox]] began discussing the monetary situation with Louis A. Garnett, a man who had worked as both the treasurer and assayer of the San Francisco Mint.<ref name="commercial">Bowers, p. 871.</ref> Garnett recommended that the United States mint a commercial dollar that would be exported to the Orient to compete with other large silver coins that were already popular in that region.<ref name="commercial"/> Garnett's rationale was that the coins would be hoarded or melted in Asia and would never be presented for redemption, allowing the government to make a profit from the [[seigniorage]].<ref>{{Cite book

The two uppermost obverse designs were created by Chief Engraver [[William Barber (engraver)|William Barber]], while the lower was created by [[Christian Gobrecht]] for the [[Seated Liberty dollar|Seated Liberty]] series.]]

On November 19, 1872, while the coinage bill was still before Congress, Linderman made a report to the Secretary of the Treasury.<ref name="linderman">{{Cite book

| location = New York, NY
| year = 1879
| pages = 47<U+2013>54}}</ref> In the report, Linderman argued that the coin need not hold legal tender status, and that it could simply be a piece of silver imprinted with its weight and fineness.<ref name="linderman"/> Linderman also notes that such a product could supersede the Mexican dollar and eventually command a six to eight percent premium; at that time, American silver exported to the Orient was being sold at a two percent discount.<ref name="linderman"/> Linderman proposed that the coin be named the "silver union" in order to distinguish it from the standard coins then in production.<ref name="linderman"/>

On February 1872, the bill was amended by a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] committee to include authorization for a commercial dollar weighing {{convert|420|gr|g}};<ref name="coinageact"/> this was struck three months later when the House voted to include provisions for the production of a standard silver dollar weighing {{convert|384|gr|g}}.<ref name="coinageact"/> While in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], a provision was added to the bill requiring the Treasury to coin a trade dollar of {{convert|420|gr|g}}, as had been done earlier in the House.<ref name="coinageact"/> The revised bill, which came to be known as the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], was approved in the House and Senate and was signed by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on February 12, 1873.<ref name="coinageact"/> The bill provided, in part, for the striking of trade dollars which held legal tender status up to five dollars.<ref name="quality">Bowers, p. 876.</ref> The legal tender provision was added by a last-minute rider at the behest of silver interests.<ref name= "b466"/> At the insistence of Ohio Senator [[John Sherman (Ohio)|John Sherman]], the weight and fineness of the piece was indicated on the reverse, an attribution which numismatic historian Don Taxay found incomprehensible as "Chinese merchants would never understand them".<ref>Taxay, pp. 257<U+2013>258.</ref>

Prior to the passage of the Coinage Act, the director of the Philadelphia Mint oversaw all branch mints.<ref name="director">Evans, p. 99.</ref> After the Act, the office of director was transferred to [[Washington, D.C.]] and responsibility for each mint was handed over to a superintendent.<ref name="director"/>

=== Design selection ===
Throughout the year of 1872, the Mint struck a series of commercial dollar patterns in anticipation of the passage of the coinage bill.<ref name="patterns">Bowers, p. 873.</ref> Production of patterns continued into 1873, but the denomination of the pattern coins was changed from "commercial dollar" to "trade dollar" before the bill was signed into law.<ref name="patterns"/> After passage of the Coinage Act, Linderman met with Director of the Mint [[James Pollock]] to discuss the design of the newly authorized trade dollar.<ref name="patterns"/> The two men agreed to request a jewelry and engraving firm, [[Finlay Enterprises|Bailey, Banks & Biddle]] of [[Philadelphia]], to create designs that would be compared to those already created by Chief Engraver [[William Barber (engraver)|William Barber]].<ref name="patterns"/>

After examining the designs of both parties, Linderman ordered that the design would depict a seated figure representing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] facing to the viewer's left, representing the direction of the Orient.<ref name="patterns"/> Linderman apparently selected the designs from two different patterns.<ref name = "t279">Taxay, p. 279.</ref> In June 1873, Linderman reviewed the various patterns created by Barber; he chose<ref name = "minting"/> an obverse which one contemporary reporter described as "a female figure seated on bales of merchandise, holding in her left hand a scroll bearing the word 'Liberty'.  At her back is a sheaf of wheat, expressing, with the bales of goods, the commercial character of the coin:  the right hand extended holds the olive branch."<ref>Vermeule, pp. 67<U+2013>68.</ref> The selected reverse depicts the [[bald eagle]] as required by law.<ref name="minting">Bowers, p. 875.</ref>  The eagle has three arrows in the right claw and an olive branch in the left, a reversal to most other U.S. silver coins of the era.<ref name = "L104">Lange, p. 104.</ref>  A set of six patterns, four with variations on the adopted obverse, and two showing portraits of Liberty, was sold by the Mint to the public in limited quantities.<ref>Vermeule, pp. 68<U+2013>69.</ref>

== Production ==

[[File:ALoudonSnowden.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Coiner A. Loudon Snowden formally complained that the high points of the trade dollar were not being fully struck.]]

Linderman assumed the position of Director of the Mint and Pollock became Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint.<ref>Evans, p. 100.</ref> In July 1873, production began on the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] needed to strike the coins.<ref name="minting"/> During this time, in a telegram to Pollock, Linderman asked that production of trade dollars be hastened because Mexico was preparing to issue another series of dollars with the older design popular in Asia, a design that was discontinued in 1866.<ref name="minting"/> The first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on July 11, 1873.<ref name="minting"/> Forty thousand pieces were issued in the first release, on July 14.<ref name = "b467">Breen, p. 467.</ref>  The [[Carson City Mint]] received its first dies for the new coins on July 22, and those intended for the [[San Francisco Mint]] arrived shortly after.<ref name="minting"/> In total, 396,635 [[business strike]]s and 865 [[Proof coinage|proof coins]] were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during the first year of production.<ref name="mintagefigures">Yeoman, p. 216.</ref> The Carson City and San Francisco mints struck 124,500 and 703,000 coins respectively.<ref name="mintagefigures"/> 

[[File:1876TradeDollarPattern.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The experimental reverse design created by Anthony C. Paquet paired with a dateless obverse. Linderman approved the design, but did not implement it due to fears of Chinese disapproval of a new and unfamiliar design.]]

There were complaints that year from officials at all three of the mints concerning the quality of the coins produced.<ref name="quality"/> In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a formal complaint to Pollock about the quality of the strikings, most notably on the high points of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief.<ref name="quality"/> The modified dies began service in 1875.<ref name="quality"/> In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient.<ref name="legaltender">Bowers, p. 877.</ref> In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the striking quality of the coins.<ref name="paquet">Bowers, p. 878.</ref> Linderman approved of the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.<ref name="paquet"/>

Though production of business strikes ended in 1878, the striking of proof coins continued in limited numbers until 1883, when the final mintage of 979 coins was struck at the Philadelphia Mint.<ref name="proofs">Yeoman, p. 217.</ref> In 1908, it was discovered that ten proofs dated 1884 and five dated 1885 were produced, but these pieces are not listed in official records and it is unknown when they were created.<ref name="proofs"/>

== Reception ==
Most of the 1873 production was exported to China, and in October of that year, the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] had an assay test conducted on the coins.<ref>Evans, p. 52.</ref> In a proclamation translated by Chinese consul and interpreter [[Walter Hillier]], the Emperor stated:<blockquote>This Proclamation, therefore, is for the information of you merchants, traders, soldiers and people of every district. You must know that the 'Eagle Trade Dollar' that has lately come to Hong Kong has been jointly assayed by officers specially appointed for the purpose, and it can be taken in payment of duties, and come into general circulation. You must not look upon it with suspicion. At the same time rogues, sharpers, and the like, are hereby strictly forbidden to fabricate spurious imitations of this new Eagle Dollar, with a view to their own profit.<br>And should they dare to set this prohibition at defiance, and fabricate false coin, they shall, upon discovery, most assuredly be arrested and punished. Let every one obey with trembling! Let there be no disobedience!<ref>Evans, p. 53.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:TradeDollarCartoon.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A political cartoon published in the April 25, 1874 issue of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''. Entitled "Rags for Our Working Men<U+2014>Specie for the Foreigners", the caption for this cartoon reads "[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]: Dear me, I do think it very wrong that the good nice trade dollar (worth 100 cents) should be sent out of the country for the benefit of the 'heathen Chinee,' for if these gentlemen are permitted to have their own way, it will take a basket full of greenbacks (worth <U+2014>?) to buy dinner for my children."<ref>Bowers, p. 964.</ref>]]

In 1874, trade dollars began appearing in American commerce.<ref name="quality"/>  In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury to pay out silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with a drop in the price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States.<ref>Taxay, p. 265.</ref>  Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California.<ref name = "b466"/>  After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country.<ref name="quality"/> Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.<ref>{{Cite book

Congress considered raising the five-dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars,<ref name = "L116">Lange, p. 116.</ref> but instead passed a bill that officially demonetized the trade dollar on July 22, 1876;<ref name="legaltender"/> the Secretary of the Treasury was directed by the act to strike no more of the coins than necessary for use in trade.<ref name = "t282">Taxay, p. 282.</ref> Despite the demonetization of the trade dollar, bullion producers continued to place the coins into the American market, resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within the United States,<ref name="legaltender"/> of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877.<ref name = "t282"/> Despite the 1876 act, it was not until October 15, 1877 that Sherman (now Secretary of the Treasury) finally ordered that the mints not accept orders for trade dollars.  On November 5,  apparently believing a false report that additional supplies were needed for the [[Chinese New Year]], he rescinded his order, finally ending orders for trade dollars on February 22, 1878.<ref name = "t283">Taxay, p. 283.</ref>

Linderman ordered a review of the successfulness of the trade dollar in China.<ref name="paquet"/> It was discovered that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited.<ref name="paquet"/> As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount.<ref name="silvervalue">Bowers, p. 879.</ref> The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept the coins.<ref name="silvervalue"/> In response, many towns set a fixed value on trade dollars.<ref name="silvervalue"/>  Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers.  The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.<ref name = "t284">Taxay, p. 284.</ref><ref name = "L117">Lange, p. 117.</ref>

Bullion prices continued to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone forced to sell at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value.<ref name = "L117"/>  Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury [[Charles J. Folger]], the question of the redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new [[Morgan dollar]] under the inflationary [[Bland<U+2013>Allison Act]].  Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so provided.  It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars.  The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland<U+2013>Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887 when the ten-day period which President [[Grover Cleveland]] had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President.<ref name = "t284"/> Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content.<ref name="silvervalue"/> The dollars were only redeemable for six months, and the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.<ref name = "L117"/>

Numismatic historian [[Walter Breen]] criticized both the legal tender provision and the coin in general, stating that the coin's issuance was "an expensive mistake <U+2013> its motivation mere greed, its design a triumph of dullness, its domestic circulation and legal tender status a disastrous provision of law leading only to ghastly abuses."<ref name = "b466"/> Trade dollars were again made legal tender by the [[Coinage Act of 1965]], which stated in part "All coins and currencies of the United States (including [[Federal Reserve note]]s and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations), regardless of when coined or issued, shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, duties and dues."<ref name = "b466"/><ref>{{Cite book
