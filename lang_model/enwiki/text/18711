The '''Goldcrest''', ''Regulus regulus'', is a very small [[passerine]] bird in the [[kinglet]] family. Its colourful golden [[Crest (bird)|crest]] feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the "king of the birds" in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of [[Eurasia]] and the islands of [[Macaronesia]]. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range [[bird migration|migrate]] to winter further south.

This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has two white wingbars. It has a plain face contrasting black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is [[display (zoology)|displayed]] during breeding. It superficially resembles the Firecrest, which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The [[Bird vocalization|song]] is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the [[Canary Islands]] are now separated into two subspecies of the Goldcrest, but were formerly considered to be a [[subspecies]] of the [[Common Firecrest]] or a separate species, ''Regulus teneriffae''.

The Goldcrest breeds in [[pinophyta|coniferous]] woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second [[avian incubation|broods]] are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of [[tit (bird)|tits]]. It may be killed by [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] or carry [[parasitism|parasites]], but its large range and population mean that it is not considered to present any significant conservation concerns.

== Description ==
The Goldcrest is the smallest European bird, 8.5<U+2013>9.5&nbsp;cm (3.3<U+2013>3.7&nbsp;in) in length,<ref name= Mullarney/> with a 13.5<U+2013>15.5&nbsp;cm (5.3<U+2013>6.1&nbsp;in) wingspan and a weight of 4.5<U+2013>7.0&nbsp; g (0.16<U+2013>0.25&nbsp;oz). It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upperparts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]]. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female;<ref name=BWP/><ref>{{cite journal|title= Age determination of Goldcrests ''Regulus regulus'' (L.) in summer and early autumn| last= Hogstad| first=Olav |journal= Ornis Scandinavica| volume=2| issue=1| year=1971| pages=1<U+2013>3}}</ref> the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous.<ref name= Simms/> The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upperparts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but has duller upperparts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and [[flight feather]]s may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field.<ref name= Baker/> The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks.<ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow | first = David |coauthors = Perrins, Christopher M (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location = Oxford | pages = 1342<U+2013>1346 | isbn = 0198501889 }}</ref>

=== Identification ===
[[File:Regulus regulus -Auderghem, Brussels -head-8.jpg|thumb|Nominate ''R. r. regulus'' in Belgium. The Goldcrest has a bright crest and a relatively plain face. A little orange is seen at the back of the crest indicating a male]]
The Goldcrest is usually easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion with the [[Common Firecrest]] or [[Yellow-browed Warbler]]. The adult Common Firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white [[supercilium]] (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced Goldcrest. The Yellow-browed Warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The [[Ruby-crowned Kinglet]], an American ''Regulus'' species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could be more difficult to distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile Ruby-crowned Kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile Goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.<ref name= Baker/>

== Voice ==
[[File:Regulus regulus -Vendee, France-8.jpg|left|thumb|Male in France displaying orange crest feathers that are set within a narrow rim of yellow feathers]]
The typical [[Bird vocalization|contact call]] of the Goldcrest is a thin, high-pitched ''zee'' given at intervals of 1<U+2013>4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough than that of the Firecrest. The song of the male Goldcrest is a very high, thin double note ''cedar'', repeated 5<U+2013>7 times and ending in a flourish, ''cedar<U+00AD>cedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee''.<ref name= Simms/> The entire song lasts 3<U+2013>4 seconds and is repeated 5<U+2013>7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong.<ref name= Simms/> Male Goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the Common Firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the Common Firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.<ref name= Simms/><ref name= Packert>{{cite journal | last= P<U+00E4>ckert | first= Martin | coauthors = Martens, Jochen; Hofmeister, Tanja | month= January | year= 2001 | title= Laut<U+00E4>u<U+00DF>erungen der Sommergoldh<U+00E4>hnchen von den Inseln Madeira und Mallorca (''Regulus ignicapillus madeirensis, R. i. balearicus'') | journal= Journal f<U+00FC>r Ornithologie |language = German | volume= 142| issue = 1 | pages= 16<U+2013>29 | doi = 10.1046/j.1439-0361.2000.00054.x }}</ref>

The songs of mainland Goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and consist of a single song type, but much more divergence has occurred in the isolated [[Macaronesia]]n populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European Goldcrests in playback experiments.<ref name= packert2004>{{cite journal | last= P<U+00E4>ckert | first= Martin | coauthors= Martens, Jochen | month= | year= 2004 | title= Song dialects on the Atlantic islands: goldcrests of the Azores (''Regulus regulus azoricus'', ''R. r. sanctae-mariae'', '' R. r. inermis'') | journal= Journal of Ornithology | volume= 145 | issue = 1 | pages= 23<U+2013>30 | url = |format = | doi = 10.1007/s10336-003-0003-8 }}</ref> There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another which is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife.<ref name= Packert/> The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by Goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.<ref name= P<U+00E4>ckertWink>{{cite journal | last= P<U+00E4>ckert | first= Martin | coauthors= Dietzen, Christian; Martens, Jochen; Wink, Michael; Kvist, Laura | month= July | year= 2006 | title= Radiation of Atlantic goldcrests ''Regulus regulus'' spp.: evidence of a new taxon from the Canary Islands | journal= Journal of Avian Biology | volume= 37 | issue = 4 | pages= 364<U+2013> 380 | url = |format = | doi = 10.1111/j.2006.0908-8857.03533.x }}</ref>

The relationships of the [[Taiwan Firecrest|Flamecrest]] or Taiwan Firecrest (''Regulus goodfellowi'') of Taiwan have also been a source of much debate.

Differences in songs, genetics and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] suggests that the Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late [[Pleistocene]], about 100,000 years ago. It is likely that the initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western [[caldera]] of [[S<U+00E3>o Miguel Island|S<U+00E3>o Miguel]], where both eastern and western song types are found. The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves.

There are a few Pleistocene (2.6&nbsp; million to 12,000&nbsp; years [[Before Present|BP]]) records from Europe of extant ''Regulus'' species, mostly Goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct ''Regulus'' is a left [[ulna]] from 2.6<U+2013>1.95&nbsp; mya in Bulgaria, which was identified as belonging to an extinct species, ''[[Regulus bulgaricus]]''.

== Distribution and habitat ==

[[File:Abies alba Skalit<U+00E9>.JPG|upright|thumb|Silver Fir is a favoured nesting tree]]
The Goldcrest breeds in mature lowland and mountain [[pinophyta|coniferous]] woodlands, mainly up to 3,000&nbsp;m (9,800&nbsp;ft), and occasionally to 4,800&nbsp; m (15,800&nbsp;ft). It uses [[spruce]], [[Larch]], [[Scots Pine]], [[Abies alba|Silver Fir]] and [[Mountain Pine]], and in man-made landscapes also introduced conifers such as [[Douglas-fir|Douglas Fir]].<ref name=BWP/> Breeding densities of up to 591 pairs per square km (1,530 pairs per square mile) have been recorded in [[Picea abies|Norway Spruce]] in Ireland, and Goldcrests constituted over 60% of all birds found in Welsh Douglas Fir and Norway Spruce plantations.<ref name=Simms/>   [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|Broad-leaved woods]] are used, only when some spruce or firs are also present. Sites such as parks and cemeteries are used only when they offer suitable conifers which are not otherwise locally available. The height and nature of any undergrowth is irrelevant.<ref name=BWP/> Unlike more specialised birds such as the [[Eurasian Nuthatch]] and the [[Eurasian Treecreeper]], both of which forage on tree trunks, the kinglets do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size.<ref name= Telleria>{{cite journal | last= Telleria | first= Jos<U+00E9> Luis | coauthors= Santos, Tom<U+00E1>s | month= | year=1995 | title= Effects of forest fragmentation on a guild of wintering passerines: the role of habitat selection | journal= Biological Conservation | volume= 71 | issue = | pages= 61<U+2013>67 | url = http://www.ucm.es/info/zoo/bcv/pdf/1995_BiolCons_71_61.pdf |format = | doi =10.1016/0006-3207(94)00021-H }}</ref> Once breeding is over, this species will readily move into deciduous trees and shrubs, [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] and similar more open habitats.<ref name=BWP/>

The Goldcrest has a huge range in Eurasia, breeding from Macaronesia to Japan. It is common in middle and northern [[Temperateness|temperate]] and [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] latitudes of Europe, between the {{convert|13|-|24|C|F}} July [[contour line|isotherms]], and thus predominantly in cooler climates than the Firecrest. Further east it occurs discontinuously through southern [[Siberia]] to [[Sakhalin]] and Japan, in the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, northern Iran, and from the Himalayas east to central China. This species occurs annually in Iceland, and breeds intermittently in the [[Faroe Islands|Faroes]].

This species is partly [[bird migration|migratory]], northernmost populations deserting their breeding areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia south of the breeding range.<ref name= Baker/> Birds in northern [[Fennoscandia]] and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights.<ref name=BWP/> Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the [[Isle of May]] in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983.<ref name=Simms/> Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe.

A study in the Baltic region showed that northern Goldcrests were more likely to migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating Goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds.<ref name= Bojarinova>{{cite journal | last= Bojarinova | first= Julia | coauthors= Ilves, Aleksandra; Chernetsov, Nikita; Leivits, Agu | year= 2008| title= Body mass, moult and migration speed of the Goldcrest ''Regulus regulus'' in relation to the timing of migration at different sites of the migration route | journal= Ornis Fennica | volume=85 | pages= 55<U+2013>65 | url = http://www.ornisfennica.org/pdf/vol85-2/3Bojarinova.pdf |format = | doi = }}</ref> The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health.<ref name= Merila>{{cite journal | last= Meril<U+00E4> | first= Juha | coauthors= Svensson, Erik | month= December | year=1995 | title= Fat reserves and health state in migrant Goldcrest ''Regulus regulus'' | journal= Functional Ecology | volume= 9| issue = 6 | pages= 842<U+2013>848 | url = http://www.helsinki.fi/biosci/egru/merila/pdf/FuncEcol1995.pdf |format = | doi =10.2307/2389981 | jstor= 2389981 }}</ref> In Hungary, Goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in [[Shrubland|scrub]], including [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]] and [[European Pear|pear]], which provided some protection from [[Eurasian Sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawks]].

The [[North Atlantic oscillation]] is an atmospheric phenomenon which affects the weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the Goldcrest) which winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s.<ref name= nao>{{cite journal | last= Hub<U+00E1>lek | first= Zden<U+00FB>k | year= 2003 | title= Spring migration of birds in relation to North Atlantic Oscillation | journal= Folia Zoologica | volume= 52 |language = 3 | issue = | pages= 287<U+2013>298 | url = http://fox.ivb.cz/folia/52/3/287-298.pdf | doi = }}</ref> The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants.

The Goldcrest is [[monogamy|monogamous]]. The male sings during the breeding season, usually while foraging rather than from a perch. It has a [[display (zoology)|display]] which involves bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest.<ref name=BWP/> Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against Goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs.<ref name= Becker>{{cite journal | last= Becker | first= Peter H | year= 1977 | title= Verhalten auf Laut<U+00E4>u<U+00DF>erungen der Zwillingsart, interspezifische Territorialit<U+00E4>t und Habitatanspr<U+00FC>che von Winter- und Sommergoldh<U+00E4>hnchen (''Regulus regulus'', ''R. ignicapillus'') |language = German | journal= Journal f<U+0169>r Ornithologie | volume= 118 | issue = 3 | pages= 233<U+2013>260 | doi = 10.1007/BF01643534 }}</ref> However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the Goldcrest and the Firecrest to share territories; either one or the other is present, but not both.

Although their ranges overlap substantially, [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] between Goldcrests and Firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns.

=== Feeding ===

[[File:Orchesella cincta.jpg|upright|[[Springtail]]s are a major dietary item.|thumb]]
All ''Regulus'' species are almost exclusively [[insectivore|insectivorous]], preying on small [[arthropod]]s with soft [[cuticle]]s, such as [[springtail]]s, [[aphid]]s and spiders. They also feed on the [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoons]] and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized Goldcrest and Firecrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than Common Firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, Firecrests will also eat the large [[orb-weaver spider|orb-web spiders]] (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).<ref name = hbw>Martens, Jochen; P<U+00E4>ckert, Martin "Family Regulidae (Kinglets & Firecrests)" pp. 330<U+2013>349 in {{cite book| last = Del Hoyo | first = Josep | coauthors= Elliott, Andrew; Christie David A (eds) | title = [[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]: Old World Flycatchers to Old World Warblers v. 11 | year =2006 | publisher = Lynx Edicions | location = Barcelona | isbn = 849655306X }}</ref>

The Goldcrest takes a wide variety of prey, especially spiders, [[caterpillar]]s, [[Hemiptera|bugs]], springtails and [[fly|flies]]. Larger prey such as [[Meconema thalassinum|oak bush crickets]] and [[Tortricidae|tortrix moths]] may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not nomally pursued; there is a record of a Goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed.<ref name = Simms/> Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground amongst leaf-litter with [[tit (bird)|tits]]. Non-animal food is rare, although Goldcrests have been seen drinking [[sap]] from broken [[birch]] twigs together with tits and nuthatches.<ref name = Simms/>

The Goldcrest feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides of branches and leaves. This is in contrast to the Common Firecrest which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of Goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of Common Firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative.<ref name = hbw/> The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; Firecrests have broader bills with longer [[feather|rictal bristle]]s (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The Firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the Goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while Firecrests have a smoother surface.<ref name= Leisler>{{cite journal | last= Leisler | first= Bernd | coauthors= Thaler, Ellen | month= | year= | title= Differences in morphology and foraging behaviour in the goldcrest ''Regulus regulus'' and firecrest ''R. ignicapillus'' | journal= Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume= 19 | issue = | pages= 277<U+2013>284 | url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf19/anz19-277-284.pdf |format = | doi = }}</ref> The Goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the [[Chiffchaff|Common Chiffchaff]], and there is some evidence that high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the Chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the Goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5&nbsp; million breeding pairs of Goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4&nbsp;million breeding pairs of Chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The Goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other ''[[Leaf-warbler|Phylloscopus]]'' warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the Chiffchaff is found within 100&nbsp; m (330&nbsp;ft) of the forest edge, with the Goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland.<ref name= Tiainen>{{cite journal | last= Tiainen | first= Juha | coauthors= Vickholm, Markku; Pakkala, Timo; Piiroinen, Jarmo; Virolainen, Erkki | year= 1983| title= The habitat and spatial relations of breeding ''Phylloscopus'' warblers and the goldcrest ''Regulus regulus'' in southern Finland | journal= Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume= 20 | pages= 1<U+2013>12 | url =http://www.annzool.net/PDF/anzf20/anzf20-001-012.pdf | doi = }}</ref> Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the Chiffchaff subspecies ''Phylloscopus collybita abietinus'' in parts of Finland is due to competition with the [[Willow Warbler]] and Goldcrest.<ref name= Lampila>{{cite journal | last= Lampila | first= Petri | coauthors = M<U+00F6>nkk<U+00F6>nen, Mikko; Rajas<U+00E4>rkk<U+00E4>, Ari | year = 2009 | title = The ability of forest reserves to maintain original fauna <U+2013> why has the Chiffchaff (''Phylloscopus collybita abietinus'') disappeared from eastern central Finland? | journal= Ornis Fennica | volume= 86 | pages= 71<U+2013>80 | url = http://www.ornisfennica.org/pdf/vol86-2/4Lampila-color.pdf | doi = }}</ref>

Outside the breeding season, small groups of Goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as [[tit (bird)|tits]] and warblers.<ref name= Baker/> This kinglet, like other species that prefer [[mixed-species foraging flock]]s in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds.<ref name= Herrera>{{cite journal | doi= 10.2307/3544516 | last= Herrera | first= Carlos M | year= 1979 | title= Ecological aspects of heterospecific flocks formation in a Mediterranean passerine bird community | journal= Oikos | volume=33 | issue = 1 | pages= 85<U+2013>96 | url = http://www.plant-animal.es/pdfs/Herrera.1979.Oikos.pdf |format = PDF | jstor= 3544516 }}</ref> A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, [[Coal Tit]]s and Goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, whilst the larger [[Willow Tit|Willow]] and [[Crested Tit]]s used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of Willow and Crested Tits was artificially reduced, Goldcrests and Coal Tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but did not do so where the larger tits were retained.<ref name= Alatalo>{{cite journal | last= Alatalo | first= Rauno V | coauthors= Gustafsson, Lars; Linden, Mats; Lundberg, Arne | month = October | year= 1985| title= Interspecific Competition and niche shifts in tits and the Goldcrest: an experiment | journal= Journal of Animal Ecology | volume=54 | issue =3 | pages= 977<U+2013>984 | url = http://jstor.org/stable/4391|format = | doi =10.2307/4391 }}</ref> In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the [[Chiffchaff|Common Chiffchaff]] and [[Blackcap]].<ref name= Simms/>

===Winter survival===
Several small passerine species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower [[basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] and [[hypothermia]], of a maximum of {{convert|10|C-change|F-change|0}} below normal body temperature, in order to reduce energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny Goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn.<ref name= Reinertsen>{{cite journal | last= Reinertsen | first= Randi Eidsmo | coauthors= Haftorn, Svein; Thaler, Ellen | year= 1988 | title= Is hypothermia necessary for the winter survival of the Goldcrest ''Regulus regulus''?| journal= Journal of Ornithology | volume= |language = 129 | issue = 4 | pages= 433<U+2013>437 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/mhq582505q880285/ |format = | doi = }}</ref> Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they actually use behavioural [[thermoregulation]] strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights.<ref name= Reinertsen/> Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third.<ref name= burton>{{cite book| last = Burton | first = Robert | title = Bird Behaviour | year = 1985 | location = London | publisher = Granada | isbn = 0246124407 |page = 134}}</ref> During an 18&nbsp;hour winter night, with temperatures as low as {{convert|-25|C|F}} in the north of its range, Goldcrests huddled together can each burn off fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm.<ref name=Atlas/>

There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore lower than that of the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.<ref name= hungary/>

The Goldcrest has a large range, estimated at 13.2&nbsp; million&nbsp; km<sup>2</sup> (5.1&nbsp; million&nbsp; mi<sup>2</sup>) and a total population estimated at 80<U+2013>200&nbsp; million individuals, and it is therefore classed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=BirdLife>{{cite web | title = BirdLife International Species factsheet: ''Regulus regulus '' | author= | pub-lisher =BirdLife International | url = http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=112555&m=1 | accessdate = 1 November 2010}}</ref> There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.<ref name=BWP/>

Although dense conifer growth can provide shelter for roosting at night, losses in hard winters can be heavy. In a Finnish study, only one-tenth of the wintering Goldcrest population, which mainly fed on spiders, survived to spring. Each group roamed within a defined winter territory, and their winter survival depended on the density of the food supply. For these northern birds there is a trade off between staying put and risking starvation, or facing the perils of migration.<ref name= Simms/> Even in somewhat milder regions, where over-wintering is normal, exceptionally cold winters can cause such heavy losses that breeding populations take several years to recover. In 1930, the English ornithologist [[Thomas Coward]] wrote:<ref name=Coward>{{cite book | last = Coward | first = Thomas Alfred | coauthors= | title = The Birds of the British Isles and Their Eggs (two volumes) | year = 1930 | location = London | publisher = Frederick Warne | pages = 126<U+2013>129 }}</ref>
<blockquote>
Until the severe winter of 1916<U+2013>17 the Goldcrest was abundant and widespread, nesting in all the wooded portions of our islands; in 1920 it could have little more than an obituary notice, for the nesting stock was practically "wiped out. " ...and for some years, even as a winter visitor, the Goldcrest remained rare, absent from most of its nesting haunts. It is, however, now fully re-established.</blockquote>

Conversely, populations can expand rapidly after a series of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an increase of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.<ref name= elkins>{{cite book | last = Elkins | first = Norman | title = Weather and Bird Behaviour | year =  1988 | location = Waterhouses | publisher = Poyser | isbn =0856610518 |page = 181 }}</ref>

[[File:Fishing boat by John Moore of Ipswich.jpg|thumb|''Fishing Boats Offshore'' by John Moore. Fishermen in Suffolk referred to the Goldcrest as the "herring spink".]]
[[Aristotle]] (384 BC <U+2013> 322 BC) and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (23 AD <U+2013> 79) both wrote about the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird which had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers, emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.<ref name= Bostock>{{cite book| last = Bostock | first = John | coauthors= Riley, H T (translators)| title = Natural history of Pliny, volume II | year = 1855 | location = London | publisher = Henry G Bohn | page = 551 }}</ref><ref name= Lawrence>{{cite book| last = Lawrence | first = Elizabeth Atwood | title = Hunting the wren: transformation of bird to symbol: a study in human-animal relationships  | year =1997 | location = Knoxville | publisher =  University of Tennessee Press | isbn = 0870499602 |pages = 27&ndash;28}}</ref> Following from this legend, in much European folklore the [[Eurasian Wren|Wren]] has been described as the "king of the birds" or as a flame bearer.
