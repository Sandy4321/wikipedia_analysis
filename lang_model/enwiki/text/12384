'''Helmut Schelsky''', (b. [[14 October]] [[1912]] in [[Chemnitz]] ([[Saxony]]/[[Germany]]), d. [[24 February]] [[1984]] in [[M<U+00FC>nster]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]])), was a very gifted German [[sociologist]], the most influential in post-war Germany, well up into the [[1970s]]. 

==Biography==
'''Helmut Schelsky''' turned to [[social philosophy]] and even more to [[sociology]], as elaborated at the [[University of Leipzig]] by [[Hans Freyer]] (the "[[Leipzig school (sociology)|Leipzig School]]"). Having earned his doctorate in [[1935]] (thesis [tr.]: ''The theory of community in the 1796 [[natural law]] by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]''), in [[1939]] he qualified as a lecturer ("''Habilitation''") with a thesis on the political thought of [[Thomas Hobbes]] at the University of K<U+00F6>nigsberg (now: [[Kaliningrad]]/Russia). He was called up in [[1941]], so did not take up his first chair of Sociology at the (then German) [[University of Strasbourg]] in [[1944]]. 

After the fall of the '[[Third Reich]]' in [[1945]], Schelsky joined the German [[Red Cross]] and formed its quite effectful ''Suchdienst'' (service to trace down missing persons). In [[1949]] he became a Professor at the [[Hamburg]] "Hochschule f<U+00FC>r Arbeit und Politik", in [[1953]] at [[Hamburg University]], and in [[1960]] he went to the [[University of M<U+00FC>nster]]. There he headed what was then the biggest West German centre for social research, in [[Dortmund]]. 

In [[1970]], Schelsky was called to be the first [[rector]] of the newly-founded [[Bielefeld University]] (creating by the way the first and only German full "Faculty of Sociology", and the "Centre of Interdisciplinarian Research" ("Zentrum f<U+00FC>r Interdisziplin<U+00E4>re Forschung" [ZiF] at [[Rheda]]), planned to be a 'German Harvard'). However, his new university changed very much, due to the years of student unrest all over Europe and North America, so he returned to M<U+00FC>nster in anger, in [[1973]], for another five years. Having been a busy and successful publisher and editor all his life, he wrote several more books, against the [[Utopianism|Utopian]] way to approach Sociology, as fostered by the [[Frankfurt School]], and on the [[Sociology of Law]], but died a broken man in [[1984]]. 

==Schelsky and German Sociology==
The "[[Leipzig school (sociology)|Leipzig School]]" (the social philosopher [[Hans Freyer]], the anthropologist [[Arnold Gehlen]], the philosopher [[Gotthard G<U+00FC>nther]]), rich in the talents of a first generation, was of strong theoretical influence on Schelsky. But Freyer also dreamt of building up a sociological think tank for the 'Third Reich' - quite differently to most other sociologists, e. g. to the (outspoken) anti-Hitlerian [[Ferdinand T<U+00F6>nnies]] ([[University of Kiel]]) and to [[Leopold von Wiese]] ([[University of Cologne]]), and to the emigrants (e. g. to [[Karl Mannheim]], and to the up-and-coming [[Ren<U+00E9> K<U+00F6>nig]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Rudolf Heberle]], and [[Lewis A. Coser]]). Freyer's ambitions failed miserably, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] power [[elite]] monopolizing [[ideology]], but helped the talented (and former Nazi) student Schelsky in his first career steps.

After the [[Second World War]], no longer a National Socialist, Schelsky became a star of [[applied sociology]], due to his great gift of anticipating social and sociological developments. He published books on the theory of [[institution]]s, on [[stratification]], on the sociology of family, on the sociology of sexuality, on the sociology of youth, on [[Industrial Sociology]], on the sociology of education, and on the sociology of the university system. In [[Dortmund]], he made the Social Research Centre a West German focus of empirical and theoretical studies, being especially gifted in finding and attracting first class social scientists, e.g. [[Dieter Claessens]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], and many more. 

It helped very much that Schelsky was an outspoken liberal professor, without any ambition to create adherents - a rare bird among German mandarins. He helped another 17 sociologists qualify as lecturers (outnumbering in this any other professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences) and anticipated the boom in sociological chairs at German universities. Manning them, he was professionally even more successful than the outstanding remigrants [[Ren<U+00E9> K<U+00F6>nig]] (Cologne) and [[Otto Stammer]] (Berlin) - the [[Frankfurt School]] starting to be of influence only after [[1968]]. 

Schelsky was able to design [[Bielefeld University]] as an innovative institution of the highest academic quality, both in research and in thought. But, the fact that his own university had moved away from his ideas hit him hard. His later books, criticizing ideological sociology (very much acclaimed now by conservative analysts) und on the sociology of law (quite of influence in the Schools of Law) kept up his reputation as an outstanding thinker, but fell out of grace with younger sociologists. Moreover, his fascinating analyses, being of highest practical value, went out of date for the same reason; only by [[2000]] did new sociologists start to read him again.
