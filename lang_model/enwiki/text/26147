'''Edward Partridge''' (August 27, 1793 <U+2013> May 27, 1840) was the grandson of Massachusetts Congressman [[Oliver Partridge]], Esq., and a member of a family noted for commercial, social, political, and military leadership in Western Massachusetts. One of the first converts to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], he was baptized in or near [[Seneca Lake, New York]] on December 11, 1830.  Partridge was the first to hold the prominent position of [[Bishop (Mormonism)|Bishop]] and [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)#Presiding Bishop|Presiding Bishop]]. Partridge expended much of his wealth in support of the movement before he died in late May, 1840 at [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]]. Joseph Smith noted that day Partridge's death could be attributed to the stress and persecution which he and other Mormon settlers in western [[Missouri]] were subjected to in the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Latter-Day Saints' Millennial Star, Volume 17, page 789 | publisher = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Utah| year = | location = | pages = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-1IoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA789&dq=%22He+lost+his+life+in+consequence+of+the+Missouri+persecutions,+and+he+is+one+of+that+number+whose+blood+will+be+required+at+their+hands.%22&hl=en&ei=e2pJTKuXLMPHnAfQ0JzjDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22He%20lost%20his%20life%20in%20consequence%20of%20the%20Missouri%20persecutions%2C%20and%20he%20is%20one%20of%20that%20number%20whose%20blood%20will%20be%20required%20at%20their%20hands.%22&f=false| doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>
