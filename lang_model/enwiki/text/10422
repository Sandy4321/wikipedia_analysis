The [[Israel|State of Israel]] is a [[Multi-party system|multiparty]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]] and the world's only [[Jewish state]], though its [[Demographics of Israel|population]] includes citizens from many different [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] backgrounds.

Various countries, [[non-governmental organizations]] and individuals have evaluated Israel's human rights record, often in relation to the ongoing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. 
{{Israelis}}

While Israel does not have a [[constitution]], it has a set of [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Laws]], intended to form the basis of a future constitution. One of those Basic Laws, [[Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (Israel)|Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty]], serves as one of the major tools for defending human rights and liberties.

==Declaration of Independence==

The [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] proclaimed on May 14, [[1948]] that "the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country" ... "was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the [[Mandate for Palestine|Mandate]] of the [[League of Nations]] which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the [[Jew|Jewish people]] and "[[Land of Israel|Eretz-Israel]] [Land of Israel] and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home." It also declared that the state "...will be open for [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the [[Prophet#Prophets in Jewish thought|prophets of Israel]]; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought|conscience]], language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]."<ref>[[wikiquote:Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]]</ref>

===Elections, political parties, and representation===
{{main|Elections in Israel}}

According to 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel, <U+201C>[t]he law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage...The country is a parliamentary democracy with an active multiparty system.

In some instances, however, parties have been disqualified from listing candidates for election.

The [[Kach]] Party had run candidates under a platform which proposed forced transfer of Arabs from Israel and establishment of a theocracy in Israel ruled by traditional Jewish law.  This platform was felt to be [[inciting]] of [[racism]] by the [[Knesset]] and was banned from participation in elections.  In 1988, the Supreme Court of Israel upheld this Knesset decision.  After a member of the Kach party slayed 29 Palestinians, the party was outlawed completely. ''See also [[Baruch Goldstein#Israel|Reactions in Israel to the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]].''

A concurrent 1985 decision to disqualify the [[Progressive List for Peace]], a party which was founded to negate the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people was conversely overturned by the Supreme court in 1988.

===Freedom of religion===
{{main|Religion in Israel}}

All religious groups have freedom to practice and maintain communal institutions in Israel.  According to the 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel, <U+201C>[t]he law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice.<U+201D><ref name = "USDS2005" /> After gaining control of the West Bank in 1967, Israel guaranteed Muslim access to mosques including the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and Christian access to Churches <ref name = "TNRGilbert">{{cite news

}}</ref>, although the corresponding right of access to Jewish holy sites was not extended to Israeli Jews when Jordan had control of the West Bank between 1948 and 1967.{{fact|date=April 2007}} Israel has extended protection to religious sites of non-Jewish religions; most famously the IDF foiled a [[Kach]] party attempt to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and continue to protect this site, built on the remains of the Jewish temples and Christian churches, from attacks by non-Muslims <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/770846.html]</ref>.  At times, the observances of holy days by various religions has the potential to cause conflict.  Israeli authorities have sometimes protected Muslim rights at the expense of Jewish ones <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193339491&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull]</ref><ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=112595]</ref>.  

Israel has given financial support towards Muslim religious observances.  In 2006, the municipality of Jerusalem made many preparations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan including the purchase and firing of shells for a special cannon used to signal the start and end of fasting and prayer times,  the adornment of the Old City<U+2019>s gates with lights in honor of the holiday, and sanitary lamb-slaughtering facilities for use during the three-day Eid el Fitr celebration at the end of the month.  In addition, the city's  welfare department will be distributing holiday gifts to needy Muslim families ahead of the holiday <ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=112351]</ref>.   During this month, Jews living in the Muslim quarter of the city were asked not to leave their homes without prior coordination during the evening hours <ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=112595]</ref>.  Israel does not give funding to some religious communities including [[Protestants]] <ref name = "USDS2005" />.

====Marriage====
{{seealso|Jewish view of marriage}}
A major issue is the lack of [[civil marriage]], as opposed to religious marriage, in Israel. A couple wishing to marry must do so through a religious ceremony, be it [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Chritianity|Christian]] or other. Non-religious couples must undergo a religious ceremony to marry, as do persons with no recognized religion, such as many of the immigrants from the former Soviet republics, who received citizenship based on a Jewish relative, but who are not recognized as Jews by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]. [[Common-law marriage]], which gives couples the same rights married couples enjoy, mitigates this difficulty. Israeli citizens may also travel abroad for a civil marriage, which is binding under Israel law.

Israel has been criticized for "discrimination in personal and civil status matters against non-Orthodox Jews.<U+201D> Israel only recognizes [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbi]]s for the purpose of marrying couples,[http://www.culturaljudaism.org/pdf/Libi_Oz_Contemplate.pdf] not allowing [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Rabbis to perform the ceremony.

===Judiciary system and criminal justice===
{{main|Israeli judicial system}}

Israeli law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary.  The 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel<ref name = "USDS2005" /> notes that the courts sometimes ruled against the executive branch, including in some security cases.  Human Rights Groups believe these requirements are generally respected.   As well the system is [[adversarial]] and cases are decided by [[professional judges]]. Indigent defendants receive mandatory representation. Some areas of the country fall under the separate judicial jurisdiction of military courts. These courts are believed to be in alignment with Israel's other criminal courts on matters pertaining to civilians. Convictions in these courts cannot be based on confession alone.<ref name = "USDS2005" />

==== Treatment of prisoners ====

The 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel:<ref name = "USDS2005" /> notes that, "conditions in [[Israel Prison Service|IPS]] facilities, which house common law criminals and convicted security prisoners...generally met international standards, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) had access to these facilities, and there were no reports of political prisoners in Israel.  

However, the report referenced above<ref name = "USDS2005" /> notes that in 2005 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have filed numerous credible complaints with the government alleging that security forces tortured and abused Palestinian detainees.  According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], more than 40,000 Palestinians have been arrested since the start of the September 2000 Al-Aqsa intifada, and Israel currently holds 9,400 Palestinian prisoners in more than 30 jails located across Israel including over 369 jailed before the [[Oslo Accords]] and 330 minors.  According to the Bureau, 70 of these minor prisoners are considered seriously ill due to lack of "basic medical attention." <ref>{{cite web

Lebanese citizen [[Mustafa Dirani]] has charged that Israeli security forces tortured and raped him during interrogations.  Another former detainee alleged he was subjected to painful positioning, beatings, long periods of interrogation, threats, and food and sleep deprivation. An independent rights group verified <U+201C><U+2026>the complainant suffered severe back pains and paralysis in his left leg from the abuse.<U+201D><ref name = "USDS2005" />

===Freedom of speech===
According to the 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel, "[t]he law provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice subject to restrictions concerning security issues.  The law provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.<ref name = "USDS2005"/>  Examples of the government's exercise of restriction have been documented.  On February 2, 2005 a public body which oversees aspects of Israeli television banned commercials which featured Palestinian figures speaking about the recent [[Geneva Accords]]. The body claimed rights according to regulations on television and commercial ethics.

Some government officials and others have been critical of the freedom of speech rights given to settlers during their forced evacuation from Gaza and the West Bank. This led to the criticism that <U+201C>the authorities took disproportional steps, unjustifiably infringing on the right to political expression and protest.<U+201D><ref name=acri>{{cite web

In 2003, Israel's film board banned from commercial screenings (in cinemas) a documentary about the 2002 [[Battle of Jenin]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/transcripts/2003/jan/030101.gradstein.html |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=January 1, 2003 |title=Israel Bans Film about Jenin Refugee Camp}}</ref> The documentary, titled "Jenin, Jenin", was a collection of interviews with residents of the Jenin refugee camp filmed in April 2002, a week after the battle. [[Mohammad Bakri]], an [[Israeli Arab]], directed the film. The film was banned due to its claims of war crimes committed by Israeli forces, which the board deemed false, and hurtful of the soldiers' families' feelings. In a later deposition following a slander lawsuit by Israeli soldiers' families, Bakri admitted to inaccuracies throughout his film. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42404 |publisher=[[WorldNetDaily]] |date=January 17, 2005 |title=Palestinian producer: False film funded by PA}}</ref>

Following legal proceedings, a petition was filed to the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], which unanimously overturned the board's decision, and allowed the movie to be shown in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3262325.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=November 11, 2003 |title=Israel court lifts Jenin film ban}}</ref>

===Right to privacy===
According to 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel, <U+201C>[l]aws and regulations provide for protection of privacy of the individual and the home.

The [[Sodomy law]] inherited from The [[British Mandate of Palestine]] was only repealed in [[1988]], though there's no record of it ever being enforced. A national [[gay rights]] law bans some anti-gay discrimination, including in employment; some exemptions are made for religious organizations. Since 1993, homosexuals have been allowed to openly serve in the military, including in special units. <ref>[http://www.actwin.com/eatonohio/gay/world.htm Homosexual rights around the world], Gay Rights Info</ref>

===Ethnic minorities and Immigration Law===
Ethnic minorities have full voting rights in Israel and are entitled to government benefits.  However, the 2005 [[US Department of State]] report on Israel criticized Israel for <U+201C>institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country<U+2019>s Arab citizens.<U+201D><ref name = "USDS2005" />

In a report submitted to the United Nations, [[Bedouin]] claim they face discrimination and are not treated as equal citizens in Israel and that [[Bedouin]] towns are not provided the same level of services or land that Jewish towns of the same size are and they are not given fair access to water. The city of Be'er Sheva refused to recognize a Bedouin holy site, despite the high court recommendation. <ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/734096.html Bedouin ask UN to help fight systemic discrimination in Israel].

During the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] in 2003, the Knesset made a temporary amendment to the ''Nationality and Entry into Israel'' law which  prohibited Palestinian married to Israelis from gaining Israeli citizenship or residency. Critics argue that the law is racist because it is targeted at Israeli Arabs who are far more likely to have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis; defenders say the law is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the Jewish character of Israel.<ref name="scotsman1">{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=721352006 |title=Arab spouses face Israeli legal purge |author=Ben Lynfield |publisher=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref><ref name="sfgate1">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/08/01/MN110656.DTL |title=Israeli marriage law blocks citizenship for Palestinians |date=August 1, 2003 |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>  The [[United Nations]] Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3152651.stm |title=UN blasts Israeli marriage law |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=15 August, 2003}}</ref> The Israeli Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, [[Yaakov Levy]], said the resolution was "highly politicized", citing the committee's failure to grant Israel's request to present evidence of the, "legislation's compliance with existing international law and practice', examples of "numerous concrete instances [in which the] granting of a legal status to Palestinian spouses of Israeli residents [was] abused by Palestinian residents of the territories for [[suicide terrorism]]," and also ignoring the fact that at the time of the UN resolution the matter was under review by the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]].  In addition, Levy noted that the UN Committee was ignoring, "existing similar laws and practices" in other states while censuring Israel. <ref>[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/cf0add5629254eb085256e1a005a49f8!OpenDocument]</ref>.

===Laws concerning Human trade===

Israel has been criticized for its policies and enforcement of laws on sex trafficking.  Women from the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]] are brought into the country by criminal elements for forced labor in the sex industry.   In 1998 the Jerusalem Post estimated that [[pimps]] engaging in this activity derived on average $50,000 - $100,000 (USD) per prostitute, resulting in a countrywide industry of nearly $450 (USD) million annually. <ref name=exploitBook>''Israel Trafficking, Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation.

===Privatization and human rights controversy===
The 2005 annual report of the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI) found that "accelerated privatization" is damaging human rights. According to the report, "State economic policy, including cutting stipends, reducing housing assistance, and constantly declining state participation in health-care and education costs, are forcing more elderly, children and whole families into poverty and despair. The increasing damage to citizens' rights to earn a dignified living - both due to low wages and the lack of enforcement of labor laws - is particularly prominent."<ref name=acri />

===Settlements===

On April 7, 2005 the United Nations Committee on Human Rights stated it was "''deeply concerned at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan due to the violation of their fundamental and human rights since the Israeli military occupation of 1967...[and] in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab territories, including in the occupied Syrian Golan, and regretting Israel's constant refusal to cooperate with and to receive the Special Committee''" <ref name=UNGolan>Question of the Violation of Human Rights In the

=== Allegations of Apartheid ===
{{main|Allegations of Israeli apartheid}}
It has been alleged that the Israeli treatment of non-Jews, particularly in territories occupied by Israel for the past forty years, is comparable to [[South Africa]]'s treatment of non-whites during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], or even rises to the level of [[crime of apartheid|criminal apartheid]]. Others respond that the former is a propagandistic slur and observe that no Israeli has ever been charged with the latter.

=== Israeli West Bank barrier === 
{{main|Israeli West Bank barrier}} 

A physical barrier, comprised mainly of fences and trenches, built by the Israeli Government which has been the center of much controversy. It is located partly within the West Bank, partly along the border between the West Bank and Israel proper. The barrier's stated purpose is "to keep the terrorists out and thereby save the lives of Israel's citizens, Jews and Arabs alike."

===Military activity===

In a 2004 report on Israel, [[Amnesty International]] claimed: 

:"abuses committed by the Israeli army constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes, including unlawful killings; extensive and wanton destruction of property; obstruction of medical assistance and targeting of medical personnel; torture; and the use of Palestinians as human shields."

:"The Israeli army killed more than 700 Palestinians, including some 150 children. Most were killed unlawfully <U+2014> in reckless shooting, shelling and air strikes in civilian residential areas; in extrajudicial executions; and as a result of excessive use of force."

:"Most members of the Israeli army and security forces continued to enjoy impunity. Investigations, prosecutions and convictions for human rights violations were rare. In the overwhelming majority of the thousands of cases of unlawful killings and other grave human rights violations committed by Israeli soldiers in the previous four years, no investigations were known to have been carried out."<ref name=aiIDF />

====Human shields====
{{see also|Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority#Exposure of civilian targets to military action}}

In April 2004, Israeli soldiers used 13-year-old Muhammed Badwan as a [[human shield]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}} during a demonstration in the West Bank village of Biddu. The soldiers tied Badwan to the front windscreen of their jeep to discourage Palestinian demonstrators from throwing stones in their direction. 

Such actions are condemned by human rights groups as violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].  Article 27 states: "civilians who find themselves in the hands of one of the parties are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect...They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof." In Article 28 of the Convention, the official commentary refers to this practice, which was used during [[World War II]], as "cruel and barbaric." Articles 31 and 51 also prohibit the use of physical or moral coercion on civilians or forcing them to carry out military tasks.<ref name=bsele>{{cite web

The Israeli High Court has issued an injunction against the practice. "You cannot exploit the civilian population for the army's military needs, and you cannot force them to collaborate with the army," said [[Aharon Barak]], President of the Supreme Court of Israel.<ref name=bbcIDF> {{cite web

Despite this ruling, on July 17, 2006 [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defense Force]] soldiers used six civilians, including two minors, as human shields during an incursion into [[Beit Hanun]]. Two boys, one aged 14 and the other 16, were ordered to lead soldiers into an area where a heavy firefight with Palestinian militants had just taken place. <ref name=bsele />

====Extrajudicial killings====
{{seealso|List of Israeli assassinations}}
:''See also [[Israel Defense Forces#Code of Conduct against terrorists|IDF: Code of Conduct against terrorists]].''

====Blockades====

According to Amnesty International:
:"Military checkpoints and blockades around Palestinian towns and villages hindered or prevented access to work, education and medical facilities and other crucial services. Restrictions on the movement of Palestinians remained the key cause of high rates of unemployment and poverty. More than half of the Palestinian population lived below the poverty line, with increasing numbers suffering from malnutrition and other health problems." <ref name=aiIDF />

===Status of Women===

Amnesty International cites hardships placed on women in the Occupied Territories by the State of Israel including women being killed or injured by Israeli forces, women being negatively affected by home demolition, restrictions on movement limiting access to health care and education, and poverty.  <ref name=aiIDF /> Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] has criticized this position as unsupported by evidence and indicative of AI<U+2019>s anti-Israel bias.<ref name = "Dersh">{{cite web

===Administrative Detention===
[[Administrative detention]] is a procedure under which prisoners are held without charge or trial. The sentences are authorized by an administrative order from the Israeli Ministry of Defence or Israeli military commanders. [[Amnesty International]] believes that the practice breaches Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]  which "makes clear that no-one should be subjected to arbitrary detention and that deprivation of liberty must be based on grounds and procedures established by law". Amnesty International is also concerned that [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]] are being "held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association". <ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engMDE150031997?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIES\ISRAEL\OCCUPIED+TERRITORIES

==Allegations of anti-Israel bias by human rights organizations==
===United Nations===
{{main|Israel and the United Nations#Anti-Israel bias}}
There are many who claim that the [[United Nations]] has a history of negative focus on Israel that is disproportional in respect to other members, including actions and statements of the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]]. Some examples of this bias include that in 2005 the Commission adopted four resolutions against Israel, equaling the combined total of resolutions against all other states in the world. Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, and North Korea were the subject of one resolution each.<ref>{{cite journal

===Amnesty International===
{{main|Amnesty International#Alleged Selection Bias}}
[[Amnesty International]] has been accused of having a double standard when it comes to its assessment of Israel.

====Claims of disproportionate attention to Israel====
In 2004, the [[NGO Monitor]], a program of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], released a study comparing Amnesty International's response to the twenty years of ethnic, religious and racial violence in [[Sudan]] in which (at that time) 2,000,000 people were killed and 4,000,000 people displaced, to their treatment of Israel. When NGO Monitor focused on 2001, they found that Amnesty International issued seven reports on Sudan, as opposed to 39 reports on Israel.<ref name = "NGOM2004">{{cite web

</ref> They further called attention to the difference in both scale and intensity: <U+201C>While ignoring the large-scale and systematic bombing and destruction of Sudanese villages, AI issued numerous condemnations of the razing of Palestinian houses, most of which were used as sniper nests or belonged to terrorists.

Expanding their investigation to include the years 2000<U+2013>2003, they found the imbalance in issued reports to be 52 reports on Sudan and 192 reports on Israel. They call <U+201C>this lack of balance and objectivity and apparent political bias is entirely inconsistent with AI's official stated mission.<U+201D><ref name = "NGOM2004" />

In 2004, Professor Don Habibi of the [[University of North Carolina Wilmington|University of North Carolina at Wilmington]] lamented the limited reports on Sudan and Darfur, in contrast to reports on Israel.

Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]], an American legal academic, is also critical of Amnesty International's perceived bias. Dershowitz analyzed an AI report on violence, rape, and murder perpetrated against Palestinian women by Palestinian men in the West Bank and Gaza which placed blame on Israel. Dershowitz points out that AI ranks the "escalation of the conflict<U+201D> and <U+201C>Israel<U+2019>s policies<U+201D> higher than the <U+201C>norms, traditions and laws which treat women as unequal<U+201D>, implying Israel is more to blame than the Palestinian perpetrators.<ref name = "Dersh">{{cite web
