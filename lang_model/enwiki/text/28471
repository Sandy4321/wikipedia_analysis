'''Hibiscus''' (real name, George Harris, Jr. ) (1949-1982) was leader of the [[psychedelic]] [[gay liberation]] theatre group known as [[the Cockettes]] in early 1970's [[San Francisco]]. His commune in a condemned Victorian on Sutter near Steiner in San Francisco was a member of a group of communes called [[KaliFlower]] that was dedicated to distributing free food and to creating free art and theater.  [[The Cockettes]], consisting of gay hippies (Gippies), women, and even babies, decked themselves out in drag and glitter for a series of legendary midnight musicals at the Palace Theater on Columbus and Union in [[North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]] [[California]].  

Hibiscus believed that all of the [[Cockettes]] shows should be free and, after a long dispute over this, left them and formed the [[Angels of Light]] in [[San Francisco]], which gave many free theatrical performances in the early [[1970]]s in [[San Francisco]] and [[New York]]. Later, in his home state of [[New York]] he also appeared in a daytime soap opera under his real name. Hibiscus died of [[AIDS]] in [[1982]].
