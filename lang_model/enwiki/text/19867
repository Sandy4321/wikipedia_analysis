'''Canadian comics''' are [[comics]] and [[cartooning]] by [[Canadian]] citizens regardless of residence, or [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent residents]] of Canada. Canada has [[Official bilingualism in Canada|two official languages]] and cultures, [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]], which have developed two distinct comics cultures. The English follows mostly [[American comics|American]] trends, and the French follows mostly [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] trends,<ref name="EncLitCan222" /> with little crossover between the two cultures. Canadian comics run the gamut of comics forms, including [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]], [[comic strip]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s and [[webcomics]], and are published in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, online, and in books. They have received much critical acclaim in the international arts-comics community,<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" /> and have received support from the [[Government of Canada|federal]] and provincial governments, including grants from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]]. There are a number of comics publishers throughout the country, as well as large [[small press]], [[self-publishing]] and [[minicomic]]s communities.

In English Canada, many cartoonists, from [[Hal Foster]] to [[Todd MacFarlane]], have sought to further their careers by moving to the US, while since the end of the 20th century, increasing numbers have managed to gain international attention while staying in Canada. During [[World War II]], trade restrictions led to the flourishing of a local [[comic book]] industry, whose black-and-white "[[Canadian Whites]]" contained original stories of heroes like [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]], as well as American scripts redrawn by local artists. The War's end saw American imports and domestic censorship lead to the death of the industry. The [[Alternative comics|Alternative]] and small press communities began to grow in the 1970s, and by the end of the century [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus]]'' and [[Chester Brown]]'s comics, amongst others, had gained international audiences and critical acclaim, and [[Drawn and Quarterly]] became a leader in arts-comics publishing. In the 21st century, comics, especially in the form of graphic novels or webcomics, have gained wider audiences and higher levels of recognition.

In French Canada, local comics are called ''[[Quebec comics|BDQ]]'' or ''bande dessin<U+00E9>e qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>coise'' ({{IPA-fr|b<U+0251><U+0303>d d<U+025B>.si.ne ke.be.kwaz}}) Cartoons with [[speech balloon]]s in Qu<U+00E9>bec date back at least as far as the late 1700s. BDQ have alternately flourished and languished throughout Qu<U+00E9>bec's history, as it is hard for such a small market to compete with foreign imports. Many cartoonists from Qu<U+00E9>bec have made their careers south of the border. Since the "Springtime of BDQ" in the 1970s, local comics magazines, like ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'' and ''[[Safarir]]'', and comics albums have become more common, although only making up 5% of total sales in the province. Since the turn of the 21st century, cartoonists such as [[Michel Rabagliati]] and the team of [[Maryse Dubuc|Dubuc]] and [[Delaf]] have seen international success in French-speaking Europe, as well as translations into other languages. [[<U+00C9>ditions Mille-<U+00CE>les]] and [[La Past<U+00E8>que]] are amongst the local publishers that have become increasingly common.

==History==
===English===
[[File:Sir John revises history.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] was a favourite target of [[John Bengough]]'s popular caricatures ]]
====Early history (1759<U+2013>1910s)====
Brigadier-General [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]]'s cartoons lampooning General James Wolfe in 1759 are celebrated as the first examples of political cartooning in Canada's history.<ref name="CanEncPolitical" /> Cartoons did not have a regular forum in Canada, however, until John Henry Walker's short-lived weekly ''Punch in Canada'', the Canadian version of Britain's humorous ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', debuted in [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]] in 1849,<ref name="Invaders21-22" /><ref name="CanEncPolitical" /> featuring cartoons by Walker. It paved the way for a number of similar short-lived publications, until the success of the more straight-laced ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'', which started in 1869, soon after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]],<ref name="Invaders22" /> and was published by [[George-<U+00C9>douard Desbarats]].<ref name="Desbarats" />

[[File:Palmer Cox - Brownies reading a book.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palmer Cox]] had an international hit with ''[[The Brownies]]'' in the late 19th and early 20th centuries]]
In 1873, [[John Bengough]] founded ''Grip'', a humorous magazine in the style of ''Punch'' and the American ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''. It featured a large number of cartoons, especially Bengough's own. The cartoons tended to be political, with Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] and [[M<U+00E9>tis]] rebel leader [[Louis Riel]] as favourite targets.<ref name="DictCanBengoughBio" /><ref name="NBArchives" /> The [[Pacific Scandal]] gave Bengough much fodder to raise his reputation as a [[Editorial cartoonist|political caricaturist]]. While Bengough was probably the most significant pre-20th Century Canadian cartoonist, [[Henri Julien]] was likely the most accomplished. Published widely both at home and abroad, Julien's cartoons appeared in periodicals such as ''Harper's Weekly'' and ''[[Le Monde illustr<U+00E9>]]''.<ref name="Invaders22" /> In 1888, he was picked up by the ''[[Montreal Star]]'' and became the first cartoonist in Canada to be hired full-time by a newspaper.<ref name="NBArchives" />

Ex-patriot [[Palmer Cox]] at this time created ''[[The Brownies]]'', a popular widely-[[Merchandising|merchandised]] phenomenon whose first book collection sold over a million copies.<ref name="Invaders22" /> Cox began a ''Brownies'' [[comic strip]] in 1898<U+2014>one of the earliest English-language strips<U+2014>and by the time it came to an end in 1907, it had also begun to use [[speech balloon]]s.<ref name="Invaders23" />

====Age of comic strips (1920s<U+2013>1930s)====
[[File:Jimmy Frise - Birdseye Center.jpg|thumb|[[Jimmy Frise]]'s ''Birdseye Center'' (later ''Juniper Junction'') was the longest-running strip in English Canada]]
Canadian cartoonists often found it hard to make it in the field of [[comic strips]] without moving [[United States|stateside]], but in 1921, [[Jimmy Frise]], one of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s drinking buddies during the journalist's days in Toronto, sold ''Life's Little Comedies'' to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'''s ''Star Weekly''. This strip was later retitled ''[[Birdseye Center]]'', and became the longest-running strip in English Canadian history. In 1947, Frise brought his strip to the ''[[Montreal Standard]]'', where it was renamed ''Juniper Junction''.<ref name="Invaders27-28" /> [[Nova Scotia]]-born artist [[J. R. Williams]] saw his single-panel strip about rural and small-town life, ''[[Out Our Way]]'', syndicated in 700 newspapers at its peak.<ref name="Invaders28" />

Two new comic strips appeared on the same day in 1929 in American newspapers to feed the public's desire for escapist entertainment at the dawn of the [[Great Depression]]. They were the first non-humorous adventure strips, and both were [[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]. One was ''[[Buck Rogers#Comic strip|Buck Rogers]]''; the other, ''[[Tarzan]]'', by [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] native [[Hal Foster]], who had worked as illustrator for catalogues from [[Eaton's]] and the [[The Bay|Hudson's Bay Company]] before moving to the States in his late 20s. These strips were soon followed by other adventures strips, and paved the way for the genre diversity that was seen in comic strips in the 1930s. In 1937, Foster began his own strip, ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', which has become his best-known work, famed for Foster's realistic artistic dexterity.<ref name="Invaders33" />

The ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' began to run ''[[Men of the Mounted]]'' in 1933,<ref name="Invaders33" /> the first home-grown adventure strip, written by [[Ted McCall]] and drawn by [[Harry Hall (cartoonist)|Harry Hall]]. McCall would later pen ''[[Robin Hood and Company]]'' as well, which would eventually make its appearance in [[comic books]] when McCall founded [[Anglo-American Publishing]] in 1941.<ref name="Invaders34" />

====Golden age: Canadian Whites (1940s)====
{{Main|Canadian Whites}}
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and subsequent [[superhero]] boom kicked off with the June 1938 release of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1. The cover story was the first appearance of [[Superman]], drawn by [[Toronto]]-born [[Joe Shuster]].<ref name="Invaders36" /> Shuster modeled Superman's [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] after his memories of Toronto, and the newspaper [[Clark Kent]] worked for after the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'', which he had [[Paperboy|delivered]] as a child.<ref name="ManOfSteelIdentityCrisis" /> These comics crossed the border, quickly gaining Canadian fans as well.<ref name="NeighborToTheNorth300" />

In December 1940, the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed. It restricted the importation of goods from the [[United States|US]] that were deemed non-essential, in order to combat the [[trade deficit]] the country had with their neighbours to the south.<ref name="Invaders43" /><ref name="EncLitCan221" /><ref name="NeighborToTheNorth300" /> American comic books were one of the casualties of the Act.<ref name="Invaders43" /> In 1941, to fill the void, a number of Canadian comic book publishers sprang up, starting in March with [[Anglo-American Publishing]] in Toronto and [[Maple Leaf Publishing]] in Vancouver. They were soon joined by [[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]]'s [[Hillborough Studios]] and [[Bell Features]]. The comics printed by these companies had colour covers, but the innards were in [[black-and-white]], giving rise amongst collectors to calling them [[Canadian Whites]]. Superheroes were prominent among them, and the "Whites" often relied on serials to keep kids coming back for more.<ref name="Invaders44" />

''[[Better Comics (comics)|Better Comics]]'' from Maple Leaf and ''[[Robin Hood and Company]]'' from Anglo-American were the first titles to hit the stands. ''Robin Hood'' was a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized comic strip reprint magazine, while ''Better'' was made up of original material in traditional comic book format, and thus can be said to be the first true Canadian comic book. It included the appearance of the first Canadian superhero, [[Vernon Miller (cartoonist)|Vernon Miller]]'s [[Iron Man (Canadian comics)|Iron Man]]. The talented John Stables, going by the pen-name [[John St. Ables]], was responsible for ''[[Brok Windsor]]'''s debut in ''Better'' in the spring of 1944<U+2014>a fantasy adventure set far in the "land beyond the mists" in the Canadian North. The success of ''Better'' led to a proliferation of titles from Maple Leaf.<ref name="Invaders44" />

[[File:Nelvana2Cover.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]]'s [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]], Canada's first female [[superhero]] ]]
The driving creative forces behind Anglo-American were [[Ted McCall]], the writer of the ''Men of the Mounted'' and ''Robin Hood'' strips, and artist [[Ed Furness]]. The pair created a number of heroes with names like Freelance, Purple Rider, Red Rover and Commander Steel. Anglo-American also published a number of stories based on imported American scripts bought from [[Fawcett Publications]], with fresh artwork by Canadians in order to bypass the trade restrictions. [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] were among the characters that had Canadian adaptations. Anglo-American published a large number of titles, including ''Freelance'', ''Grand Slam'', ''Three Aces'', ''Whiz'', ''Captain Marvel'' and ''Atom Smasher'', but relied less on serials, and was less patriotically Canadian than its rival publishers. It employed a number of talented artists, but they were kept to a "house style" of drawing, in the vein of Captain Marvel's [[C. C. Beck]].<ref name="Invaders45" />

In August 1941, three unemployed artists, [[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]] and Andr<U+00E9> and Ren<U+00E9> Kulbach, formed [[Hillborough Studios]] to publish their comics, starting with ''Triumph-Adventure Comics''. The star of ''Triumph-Adventure'' was Canada's first female superhero, [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]],<ref name="Invaders47" /> who appeared several months before [[Wonder Woman]] came along.<ref name="Invaders48" /> Nelvana was inspired by tribal stories brought back from the [[Arctic]] [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] painter [[Franz Johnston]].<ref name="Invaders60" /> The popular fur-miniskirted superheroine was a powerful [[Inuit]] mythological figure, daughter of a mortal woman and Koliak the Mighty, King of the Northern Lights. She was able to ride the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Northern Lights]] at the speed of light, turn invisible, melt metal, and had [[Telepathy|telepathic powers]].<ref name="GuardiansNelvana" />

In March 1942, Dingle and most of the Hillborough staff moved, along with Nelvana, to Toronto-based [[Bell Features]], which had begun publishing comics in September 1941 with the first issue of the hugely successful ''Wow Comics''<U+2014>in colour at first, but Bell soon switched to the familiar "White" format.<ref name="Invaders48" /> Bell was the most prolific of the Canadian comics publishers.<ref name="Invaders50" /> Their comics were drawn by a large pool of artists, including freelancers, adolescents, and women, and were unabashedly Canadian. Aside from Nelvana, there were Edmund Legault's Dixon of the Mounted, Jerry Lazare's Phantom Rider, and Fred Kelly's Doc Stearne. Leo Bachle's [[Johnny Canuck]] was the second Canadian national hero, and debuted in Bell's ''Dime Comics'' in February 1942.<ref name="Invaders48" />

The new Canadian comics were successful, with Bell reaching weekly sales of 100,000 by 1943. By this time, [[Educational Projects]] of [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]] had joined in, selling comics in the "White" format. Educational specialized in a different sort of fare: biographies of prime ministers, cases of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]], and historical tales, drawn by accomplished artists like George M. Rae and [[Sid Barron]]. Educational's ''Canadian Heroes'' earned endorsements from cabinet ministers and appealed to parents and educators, but was not so appealing to the kids it was aimed at until Rae convinced publisher Harry J. Halperin to allow him to include a fictional character, [[Canada Jack]]<U+2014>a more realistic hero who battled [[Nazi]]s.<ref name="Invaders50" />

With the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, Canadian comic book publishing was faced with competition from American publishers once again. Educational and late-comer Feature Publications folded immediately. Maple Leaf tired to compete by switching to colour, and by trying to break into the British market. Anglo-American and another newcomer, Al Rucker Publications, tried to compete directly with the Americans, even achieving distribution in the States.<ref name="Invaders52" /> By the end of 1946, however, it was clear that the remaining publishers could not compete, and for the time being, original comic book publishing came to an end in Canada, although some publishers would survive by republishing American books, until the War Exchange Conservation Act was officially abolished in 1951.<ref name="Invaders70" /> The cartoonists who insisted on drawing for a living faced several choices: some moved across the border to attempt to make it with the American publishers, and some moved into illustration work, as Jerry Lazare, Vernon Miller, [[Jack Tremblay]] and [[Harold Bennett]] did. Another avenue was political cartooning, which was the route Sid Barron followed.<ref name="Invaders56" /> By 1949, out of 176 comics titles on the newsstand, only 23 were Canadian.<ref name="TheTroubleWithNormal144" />

====Post-war (late 1940s<U+2013>early 1970s)====
With the end of most original Canadian comic book publishing in 1947, Canada's superheroes disappeared, and the country entered a phase of foreign comic book domination. In the late 1940s, a [[crime comics]] scare hit the country when a pair of voracious comic book readers in [[Dawson Creek]], [[British Columbia]], shot at a random car while playing highwaymen, fatally wounding a passenger. When authorities discovered their taste for comic books, media attention focused on the emerging [[crime comics]] genre as an influence on [[juvenile delinquency]]. A bill to amend Section 207 of the Criminal Code was drafted, and passed unanimously, making it an offence to make, print, publish, distribute, sell, or own "any magazine, periodical or book which exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially the commission of crimes, real or fictitious",<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1947-1966" /><ref name="TheTroubleWithNormal149" /> on 10 December 1949. Comics publishers across Canada banded together to create the Comic Magazine Industry Association of Canada (CMIAC), a Canadian industry self-censoring body similar to the American [[Comics Code Authority]] that would be formed a few years later in response to a similar crime comics scare in the U.S.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1947-1966" />

[[Superior Publishers]], however, defied the ban, while also moving into the U.S. market. Watchdogs turned up the heat, and in 1953 a distributor was found guilty of distributing obscenities. Some of Superior's titles found themselves in [[Fredric Wertham]]'s notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency, ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', published in 1954. The [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]], established in 1953, had [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency#1954 comic book hearings|public hearings]] a few months later, and called upon [[Kamloops]]. [[British Columbia|BC]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[E. Davie Fulton]], one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman's most outspoken enemies, as a witness. The Comics Code Authority was soon formed, and Superior, like fellow American publisher [[EC Comics]], saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955. Prosecutions increased throughout Canada, with Superior successfully defending themselves in one, and another supposedly comics-related murder was reported in [[Westville, Nova Scotia]]. Superior shut its doors in 1956, and until the 1970s, English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more, although a number of "giveaway" comics continued to be produced by Orville Ganes' Ganes Productions and [[Owen McCarron]]'s Comic Book World, who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations, aimed at kids and teens.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1947-1966" />

[[File:Doug Wright - Nipper 1953-10-17 last panel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Wright (cartoonist)|Doug Wright]]'s ''Nipper'' was a mainstay in Canadian newspapers in the post-war years]]
The crackdown was not aimed at comic strips, however, and several notable new ones appeared, like Lew Saw's ''One-Up'', Winslow Mortimer's ''Larry Brannon'' and Al Beaton's ''Ookpik''.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1947-1966" /> After [[Jimmy Frise]]'s death in 1948, ''[[Juniper Junction]]'' was taken over by [[Doug Wright (cartoonist)|Doug Wright]], "one of Canada's best post-war comic-strip artists".<ref name="Invaders27-28" /> He would continue with the strip until 1968, while also working on his own ''Nipper'' from 1949. In 1967, ''Nipper'' became ''Doug Wright's Family'' when Wright moved from Montr<U+00E9>al to Ontario, and the popular strip continued until 1980.<ref name="WrightAwardsWrightBio" /> The [[Doug Wright Award]]s were inaugurated in his honour in 2005.

Early [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]] lacked a local flavour, tending to be a pale imitation of American examples. It tended to be cheery, non-confrontational, and supported good causes. Following the War it broke from typical American clich<U+00E9>s and took on more of a savage bite, especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons. At ''[[Le Devoir]]'', Robert Lapalme was the first to cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom, and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montr<U+00E9>al. Lapalme was later followed by [[Duncan Macpherson]] at the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Leonard Norris at the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' and Ed McNally at the ''[[Montreal Star]]''. These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of the papers in which they were published.<ref name="CanEncPolitical" /><ref name="NBArchives" /> Macpherson drew a cartoon of [[John Diefenbaker]] as [[Marie Antoinette]] saying "Let them eat cake" in response to the Prime Minister's cancelling the [[Avro Arrow]] project, which historian [[Pierre Burton]] has called the beginning of Canadians' disillusionment with Diefenbaker's government.<ref name="OffWithTheirHeads" /> Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for editorial independence, challenging his editors and threatening to quit the ''Star'' if not given his way, which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow.<ref name="CanEncPolitical" />

In 1967, Canada saw its first [[comic shop]] open its doors. Memory Lane in Toronto, established by George Henderson, inspired pioneering retailer Harry Kremer and Bill Johnson to open [[Now & Then Books]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Its newsletter, the ''Now and Then Times'', published early work by the young [[Dave Sim]] in its inaugural issue in 1972, and later employed him from 1976 to 1977.<ref name="SequentialNowThen" />

In the late 1960s, along with the [[Counterculture|countercultural]] movement, a new form of comic art appeared from the [[avant-garde]] and literary scenes<U+2014>[[Underground comix|underground comics]] (or "comix") aimed at an adult audience. Early examples appeared in certain magazines, but an early precursor of Canadian underground comic books was ''Scraptures'', as a special issue of the Toronto avant-garde literary magazine ''[[GrOnk (magazine)|grOnk]]'' in 1967. In 1969, Canada saw its first true underground comics, with ''SFU Komix'' and ''Snore Comix''. These comix drew their inspiration from the American underground movement that exploded after the release of [[Robert Crumb]]'s ''[[Zap Comix|Zap]]'' in early 1968. Martin Vaugh-James produced an early [[graphic novel]] when he had ''Elephant'' released by Press Porc<U+00E9>pic in 1970. The underground movement paralleled that of the US, in that it peaked from 1970 to 1972 with the peak of the counterculture, and witnessed a sharp decline afterward. [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]'s [[Dave Geary]] and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]]'s [[Rand Holmes]] were key figures, Holmes being the creator of the ''Harold Hedd'' comic strip.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1967-1974" />

Humour magazine ''Fuddle Duddle'', named after a [[Fuddle duddle|famous euphemism]] by then-Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], was a short lived attempt at a Canadian ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''-style satirical magazine. It was the first comic book of Canadian content to be available on newsstands since 1956. Two of its contributors, Peter Evans and [[Stanley Berneche]], would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada for the first time since the demise of [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights|Nelvana]] in 1947, with [[Captain Canuck]].<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1967-1974" />

The fan press and [[fandom]] grew throughout this period, and was bolstered when [[Patrick Loubert]] and [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], the founders of the animation company [[Nelvana]], published of ''[[The Great Canadian Comic Books]]'' in 1971,<ref name="Invaders71" /> a book-length study of the [[Bell Features]] comics, and the touring of a related exhibition mounted by the [[National Gallery of Canada]], ''Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45'', which together served to introduce English-Canadian comics creators and fans to their lost heritage.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1967-1974" />

Towards the middle of the 1970s, comics aimed at children gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of [[science fiction]] and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like [[Gene Day]], [[Dave Sim]], Augustine Funnell, [[Jim Craig (cartoonist)|Jim Craig]], [[Ken Steacy]], [[Dean Motter]], and Vincent Marchesano.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1967-1974" />

====New wave (mid-1970s<U+2013>1980s)====
The mid-1970s saw the beginning of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. [[Richard Comely]]'s [[Captain Canuck]] appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own.<ref name="Invaders121" /> This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed [[Orb (comics magazine)|''Orb'']], which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.<ref name="Invaders121-122" />

The comics magazines showing up in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. [[Phil Seuling]]'s [[California]]-based comics distributor [[Bud Plant]] was supportive of these [[Underground comix|underground]] and [[Alternative comics|alternative]] comics, though, and helped get them into stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant and the emergence of specialty [[comic shop]]s would form a distribution network for [[small press]] comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands.<ref name="Invaders122" />

[[File:FBorFW Patterson family.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Johnston]]'s ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', the most widely-distributed Canadian comic strip ]]
The world of comic strips saw a number of works pop up. [[Ben Wicks]] was doing ''The Outsiders'' and ''Wicks'', [[Jim Unger]]'s ''[[Herman (comic strip)|Herman]]'' debuted in 1975, Ted Martin's ''Pavlov'' in 1979.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1975-1988" /> In 1978, [[Lynn Johnston]], living in [[Lynn Lake, Manitoba]], began ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', which was noted for following the lives of the Patterson family as they grew older in [[real time (media)|real time]], and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the [[midlife crisis]], [[divorce]], the [[coming out]] of one [[Homosexuality|gay]] character,<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" /> [[child abuse]], and [[death]]. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a [[Reuben Award]],<ref name="BetterWorseOldNew" /> and the [[Friends of Lulu]] added her to the [[List of Lulu Award winners|Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame]] in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers<ref name="BetterWorseOldNew" /> in 25 countries.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" /><ref name="Invaders184" />

Editorial cartoonists held considerable sway between the 1950s through the 1970s. Former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] has been quoted that he lost votes in the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|election of 1980]] due to political cartoons about him.<ref name="OffWithTheirHeads" /> They have also experienced the fear of censorship through the courts, or "libel chill". In 1979, Robert Bierman and the ''[[Times Colonist|Victoria Times]]'' was the subject of a [[libel]] suit when he criticized the policies of [[William Vander Zalm]], the [[British Columbia]] Minister of Human Resources, with a cartoon of the Minister pulling the wings off flies. When the courts ruled in Vander Zalm's favour, newspapers across the nation ran their own versions of the cartoon in support, until the BC Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in 1980, deeming the cartoon "fair comment". It was later acquired by the [[National Archives of Canada]].<ref name="NBArchives" /><ref name="GoodBadTransient" /><ref name="MemoryOfBobBierman" />

[[File:Dave Sim and Cerebus.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dave Sim]] proselytized the virtues of [[self-publishing]] and [[Creator's Bill of Rights|creators' rights]] while pushing artistic boundaries with his series, ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'']]
''Captain Canuck'' and ''Orb'' both folded by 1976, but in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] in December 1977, [[Dave Sim]]'s independent comic book ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'' debuted, and would become the longest-lived original Canadian comic book.<ref name="Invaders124" /> Benefiting from distribution in the emerging [[comic shop]] market,<ref name="NeighborToTheNorth302" /> it started as a ''[[Howard the Duck]]''-like [[parody]] of [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s ''[[Conan (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' comics. The story eventually grew to fit Sim's expanding ambitions, both in content and technique, with its [[Aardvark|earth-pig]] protagonist getting embroiled in politics, becoming prime minister of a powerful [[city-state]], then a [[Pope]] who ascends to the moon<U+2014>all within only the first third of its projected 300-issue run. Sim came to conceive the series as a self-enclosed story, which itself would be divided into [[novel]]s<U+2014>or [[graphic novels]], which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s. While Sim and his partner [[Gerhard (cartoonist)|Gerhard]]'s technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers, Sim also spoke out for [[Creator's Bill of Rights|creators' rights]], promoted his peers and up-and-coming creators, and fiercely promoted [[self-publishing]] as an ideal. Americans [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] with ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' and [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] with ''[[Strangers in Paradise]]'' took Sim's cue, as did Canadian [[M'Oak]] (Mark Oakley) with his long-running ''[[Thieves and Kings]]''. [[Eddie Campbell]] took Sim's personal advice to self-publish the collected ''[[From Hell]]'' at the turn of the century.<ref name="ABigSpread10" /> Sim also stirred considerable controversy, sometimes with the content of ''Cerebus'', and sometimes with his editorials and personal interactions.<ref name="Invaders124" />

[[David Boswell]] was amongst those in the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he self-published his ''Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman'' starting in 1980.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1975-1988" /> From out of the same scene,<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1975-1988" /> , [[Bill Marks]] started publishing the anthology ''Vortex'' in Toronto in 1982.<ref name="Invaders126" /> Marks' [[Vortex Comics]] expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for ''[[Mister X (Vortex)|Mister X]]'', which employed the talents of [[Gilberto Hernandez|Gilberto]] and [[Jaime Hernandez]] and, later, Torontonian [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]]. Most notably, Marks picked up [[Chester Brown]]'s ''[[Yummy Fur (comics)|Yummy Fur]]'', a taboo-breaking series which started out in 1983 as a self-published, [[Photocopier|photocopied]] [[minicomic]]. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. The book's stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal ''[[Ed the Happy Clown]]'', [[Chester Brown's Gospel adaptations|straight adaptations]] of the [[Gospels]], and revealing, bare-all [[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics|autobiographical stories]]. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.<ref name="Invaders126" />

As the content of comics matured throughout the 1980s, they became the subject of increasing scrutiny. In 1986, a [[comic shop]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] called Comic Legends was raided and charged with obscenity. In response, [[Derek McCulloch (comics)|Derek McCulloch]] and Paul Stockton established the [[Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund]] to help retailers, distributors, publishers, and creators fight against obscenity charges. To raise funds, they published two ''True North'' anthologies of Canadian talent.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1975-1988" />

During this time, large numbers of Canadian artists were making waves in the American comic book market as well, such as [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Gene Day]] and his brother Dan, Jim Craig, [[Rand Holmes]], [[Geof Isherwood]], [[Ken Steacy]], [[Dean Motter]], [[George Freeman (comics)|George Freeman]] and [[Dave Ross (comics)|Dave Ross]].<ref name="Invaders128" /> Byrne was particularly popular for his work on ''[[X-Men]]'', and also originated ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', about a team of Canadian superheroes.<ref name="EncLitCan222" />

====1990s====
In 1990, [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]]-based publisher [[Drawn and Quarterly]] began with an anthology title also named ''Drawn and Quarterly''. It quickly picked up a number of other titles, such as [[Julie Doucet]]'s semi-autobiographical, bilingual ''[[Dirty Plotte]]'', which, like ''Yummy Fur'', had started out as a [[minicomic]]; Seth's ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]]''; illegal resident from the US [[Joe Matt]]'s ''[[Peepshow (comics)|Peepshow]]''; and ''Yummy Fur'', which made the jump with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an [[autobiographical comics]] trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as something of a Toronto comics [[rat pack]], depicting each other in each other's comics and doing signings and interviews together.<ref name="ChesterTheLibertarian" />

Drawn and Quarterly was at the forefront of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher [[Chris Oliveros]] saw as stifling comics' growth.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" /> These comics had artistic aspirations,<ref name="EncLitCan223" /> and [[Graphic novel]]s became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical ''[[The Playboy: A Comic Book|The Playboy]]'' and ''[[I Never Liked You]]'', and Seth's faux-autobiographical ''[[It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken]]'' garnering considerable attention.

A young hotshot from [[Calgary]] named [[Todd McFarlane]] had been making waves waves since the 1980s illustrating comics for [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics]], becoming a superstar writer/artist for ''[[Spider-Man]]''. He eventually left to co-found the creator-owned comic publishing collective [[Image Comics]], where he debuted ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', an enormously successful title of his own creation. ''Spawn'' holds the record for most copies sold of an independent comic,<ref name="PeopleSpawn" /> and was the most financially successful comics franchise of the decade.<ref name="EncLitCan222" /><ref name="NeighborToTheNorth303" />

====21st Century====
[[File:Rielcomicstripcover.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Chester Brown]]'s best-selling ''[[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|Louis Riel]]'' was the first work in comics to receive a [[Canada Council]] grant. ]]
At the dawn of the 21st Century, the comics industry had changed considerably. The [[graphic novel]] had come into its own, and traditional comics sales dropped significantly. [[Louis Riel]], who had been a major target of [[John Bengough]]'s caricatures in the early days of Confederation, was the protagonist in [[Chester Brown]]'s award-winning, best-selling<ref name="CanArtBrownInterview" /> "[[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|comic-strip biography]]". With his graphic novels and book collections, he gained a wider audience than he had with his serial comic books,<ref name="NeighborToTheNorth302" /> and he abandoned serial comics entirely to focus on original graphic novels after ''Louis Riel''. Greater appreciation of the artform was shown when Brown and Seth became recipients of grants from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].<ref name="Q+Q2011-11" /><ref name="DailyBrew201104" /> Dave Sim's ''Cerebus'' completed its planned 26-year, 300-issue run in 2004.<ref name="NeighborToTheNorth302" /><ref name="Invaders176" />

Foreign comics, especially [[Manga|Japanese]], became quite successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining large numbers of female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books.<ref name="MangaCraze" /> They also had a significant influence on artists such as [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] and his ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' series.<ref name="EncComicBooks386" /> Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as [[child pornography]] and result in jail terms.<ref name="MangledManga" /><ref name="MangaChildPorn" />

Drawn and Quarterly has become known as a house for art comics, translations of non-English works, like Montr<U+00E9>aler [[Michel Rabagliati]]'s ''Paul'' series,<ref name="TStarRabagliati" /> and archive editions of classic comics, such as [[Doug Wright II|Wright]]'s ''Little Nipper''. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal r<U+00F4>le in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US.<ref name="CBDandQ" /> D&Q publisher [[Chris Oliveros]], along with [[Art Spiegelman]], lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.<ref name="NotFunnies2" />

[[Webcomics]], such as [[Kate Beaton]]'s ''[[Hark! A Vagrant]]'', [[Ryan Sohmer]] and [[Lar deSouza]]'s ''[[Looking for Group]]'', and [[Karl Kerschl]]'s ''[[The Abominable Charles Christopher]]'', became an increasingly popular outlet for Canadian cartoonists.<ref name="Invaders184" /> The popularity of Beaton's work has led to it being published in book form, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine placing it in the top 10 fiction books of 2011.<ref name="HarkVagrantTime2011" />

The comics community in Canada has grown, and has grown appreciative of its talent, celebrating it with awards such as the [[Doug Wright Award|Doug Wrights]] and [[Joe Shuster Award|Joe Shusters]],<ref name="Invaders187" /> as well as with classy events such as the international [[Toronto Comic Arts Festival]], which has been cosponsored by the [[Toronto Public Library]] since 2009.<ref name="TorontoistMothersDay" />

{{Main|Quebec comics}}
The comics of Qu<U+00E9>bec, also known as "BDQ" (''bande dessin<U+00E9>e qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>coise''), have followed a different path than those of English Canada. While newspapers tend to populate their funny pages with [[Print syndication|syndicated]] American [[comic strip]]s, in general comics their have followed [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] trends, comics like ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' being particularly popular and influential. Comics also tend to be printed in the album format that is popular in Europe.<ref name="BTF-QC-PublishingComics" /> Aside from humorous parodies, there is no superhero tradition in Qu<U+00E9>bec comics.<ref name="EncLitCan222" /><ref name="SmashingTheAxis" />

====Early history (1790s<U+2013>1960s)====
[[File:Raoul Barr<U+00E9> - Pour un diner de Noel.jpg|right|thumb|"Pour un d<U+00EE>ner de No<U+00EB>l" (Raoul Barr<U+00E9>, 1902), the first [[comic strip]] to appear in a daily Qu<U+00E9>bec newspaper. Barr<U+00E9> demonstrates an interest in movement, which he would develop later as a pioneer in [[animation]] ]]
Qu<U+00E9>bec comics have alternately flourished and languished, seeing several brief periods of intense activity followed by long periods of inundation with foreign content. Comics first appeared in the humour pages of newspapers in the 19th century, following the trends coming from Europe. In the late 19th Century, [[Henri Julien]] published two books of political caricatures, ''L<U+2019>album drolatique du journal Le Farceur'', after which the number of cartoonists began to increase in newspapers in [[Qu<U+00E9>bec City]] and [[Montr<U+00E9>al]]. 1904 saw, in the newspaper ''[[La Patrie]]'', the publication of ''[[Les Aventures de Timoth<U+00E9>e]]'' (''The Adventures of Timoth<U+00E9>e'') by [[Alb<U+00E9>ric Bourgeois]]. This is said to be the first French-language comic to feature [[speech balloons]].<ref name="BTF-QC-NSo20thC" /> Joseph Charlebois's comic-strip adaptation of ''Le P<U+00E8>re Lad<U+00E9>bauche'' (Father Debauchery) also debuted in 1904, in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', a popular strip that would last until 1957.<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" />

[[Raoul Barr<U+00E9>]] had the first comic strip to appear in a Qu<U+00E9>bec daily newspaper in 1902, called ''"Pour un d<U+00EE>ner de No<U+00EB>l"'' ("For a Christmas Dinner").<ref name="BTF-QC-NSo20thC" /> In 1912, he created a strip called ''Noahzark Hotel'' for the [[New York]]-based [[McClure Syndicate]], which he brought to ''[[La Patrie]]'' in French the next year. Soon after he moved into [[animation]], becoming an innovative pioneer in the field.<ref name="Invaders27" />

Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois cartoonists would propose a number of strips to compete with the American strips that dominated the Sundays and dailies. The native Qu<U+00E9>bec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. [[Albert Chartier]] created the comical character ''[[On<U+00E9>sime]]'' in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Qu<U+00E9>bec.<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" /> After [[World War II]], during the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Qu<U+00E9>bec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.<ref name="BTF-QC-GreatDarkness" />

====Springtime of BDQ (1970s<U+2013>present)====
The revolutionary 1960s and the [[Quiet Revolution]] in Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>c saw a new vigour in BDQ. What Georges Raby called the Spring of Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois comics<ref name="EncLitCan222" /> (''printemps de la BD qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>coise'') is said to have begun in 1968 with the creation of the group Chiendent, who published in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' and ''Dimanche-Magazine''. [[Jacques Hurtubise]], R<U+00E9>al Godbout, Gilles Thibault, and Jacques Boivin were particularly notable cartoonists, and numerous short-lived publications with strange names appeared, like ''Ma<U+00AE>de in Qu<U+00E9>bec'' and ''L'Hydroc<U+00E9>phale illustr<U+00E9>''. The comics no longer focused on younger audiences, instead seeking confrontation or experimenting with graphics,<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" /> drawing influence from French comics for mature audiences like those published in ''[[Pilote]]'', as well as translations of American [[Underground comix|undergrounds]], translations of which were published in the journal ''Mainmise''.<ref name="EncLitCan222" /> During the 1970s, BDQ were sometimes called "BDK", ''bande dessin<U+00E9>e k<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>coise''.<ref name="Carpentier" />

[[File:Croc magazines.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'' was a popular outlet for Qu<U+00E9>bec cartoonists in the 1980s]]
In 1979, Jacques Hurtubise, [[Pierre Huet (cartoonist)|Pierre Huet]] and [[H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Fleury]] would establish the long-lived, satirical ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'', which published many leading talents of the era, many of whom were able to launch their careers through the magazine's help. ''Croc'' begat another magazine, ''Titanic'', dedicated to comic strips, and in 1987, ''[[Safarir]]'', a ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''-like publication patterned after the French ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'', rose in competition with ''Croc''. By the mid-1980s, a number of professional comics publishers began to flourish.<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" />

In Montreal in the 1980s and 1990s, in parallel to mainstream humour magazines, a healthy underground scene developed, and self-published fanzines proliferated. [[Julie Doucet]], [[Henriette Valium]], [[Luc Giard]], [[Eric Theriault|<U+00C9>ric Th<U+00E9>riault]], [[Gavin McInnes]] and Siris were among the names that were discovered in the small press publications.<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" />

[[File:Michel Rabagliati 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Michel Rabagliati]]'s semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] comics have had international success, in French and in translation]]
In the 21st Century, [[Michel Rabagliati]] and his semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] ''Paul'' series has seen [[Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]-like sales levels in Qu<U+00E9>bec, and his books have been published in English by [[Drawn and Quarterly]].<ref name="TStarRabagliati" />

Around the turn of the century, the government of Qu<U+00E9>bec mandated La Fondation du 9e art ("The [[Ninth art|9th Art]] Foundation") to promote francophone cartoonists in North America. There have also emerged events such as the Festival de la bande dessin<U+00E9>e francophone de Qu<U+00E9>bec in [[Quebec City|Qu<U+00E9>bec City]] and la Zone internationale du neuvi<U+00E8>me art (ZINA).<ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips" />

==Publication, promotion and distribution==
As in the US, large Canadian [[newspapers]] typically have a page of [[comic strip]]s in their daily editions, as well as a full-colour [[Sunday comics]] section on Saturdays or Sundays. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s are also common, and the [[Association of Canadian Editorial Cartoonists]] is a professional association founded in 1988 to promote their interests.<ref name="NBArchives" />

There are a number of English- and French-language publishers active in Canadian comics. [[Drawn and Quarterly]] is a [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]]-based English-language publisher of arts comics, translations and classic comic reprints, founded by [[Chris Oliveros]] in 1990, and one of the most influential publishers in [[alternative comics]].<ref name="NeighborToTheNorth302" /> [[Arcana Studio]] of [[British Columbia]] publishes a large number of titles, and [[Koyama Press]] joined the fray in 2007. In French, [[Les 400 coups]], [[M<U+00E9>canique G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]], [[La Past<U+00E8>que]] and the Qu<U+00E9>bec arm of [[Gl<U+00E9>nat (publisher)|Gl<U+00E9>nat]] are amongst the active publishers. The [[small press]] has played an important r<U+00F4>le,<ref name="Invaders126" /> with [[self-publishing]] a common means of putting out comics, largely influenced by the success of [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]''. [[Minicomics]] is another form that has remained popular since the 1980s, when [[Chester Brown]] and [[Julie Doucet]] got started distributing self-published [[Photocopier|photocopied]] comics, and have been spurred on by ''[[Broken Pencil]]'', a magazine dedicated to promoting the [[zine]] scene.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" />

A number of [[fan convention]]s are held throughout Canada, including the [[Central Canada Comic Con]], [[Fan Expo Canada]], [[Montreal Comiccon]], [[Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon]], and [[Toronto Comicon]]. The [[Toronto Comic Arts Festival]] (TCAF), modeled after European festivals such as [[Angoul<U+00EA>me International Comics Festival|Angoul<U+00EA>me]] and the American [[Small Press Expo]], has grown since 2003, and since 2009 has enjoyed the support of the [[Toronto Public Library]].<ref name="TorontoistMothersDay" />

===Awards===
A number of awards for Canadian comics and cartooning have appeared, especially since the beginning of the 21st Century.

The [[National Newspaper Awards]] was established in 1949<ref name="CBC-NNA2009" /> with a category for [[Editorial cartoonist|Editorial Cartooning]]<ref name="NBArchives" /> honouring those that "embody an idea made clearly apparent, good drawing, and striking pictorial effect in the public interest". The award's first recipient was Jack Booth of the ''[[Globe and Mail]]''.<ref name="CanEncPolitical" />

The B<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>lys Prize (''Prix B<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>lys'') has been awarded to French language comics since 2000. It comes with [[Bursary|bursaries]] for the Prix B<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>lys Qu<U+00E9>bec (for Best Book from Qu<U+00E9>bec) and Prix B<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>lys Fanzine.<ref name="ShusterBedelys" />

Since 2005 the [[Joe Shuster Award]]s have been handed out by the [[Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association]], named after the [[Toronto]]-born co-creator of [[Superman]]. It is open to all [[Canadian]]s, including those living abroad, as well as [[permanent resident]]s, in any language.<ref name="OurNeighborToTheNorth302-303" /> Along with awards for Outstanding Cartoonist, Outstanding Writer, Outstanding Artist and others, it also features the Joe Shuster Hall of Fame and the Harry Kremer Retailer Award, named after the founder of Canada's [[Now & Then Books|oldest]] surviving [[comic shop]].<ref name="CBDShuster" />

The [[Doug Wright Award]]s also began in 2005. Awards are given for Best Book, Best Emerging Talent, and, since 2008, the Pigskin Peters Award, for non-narrative (or nominally-narrative) comics, named after a character in [[Jimmy Frise]]'s ''[[Birdseye Center]]''.<ref name="CBC2008-06-03" /> The Doug Wright Awards also inducts cartoonists into Giants of the North: The [[Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame]].<ref name="AOLCanada2008-08-09" />

==Academia==
From the 1990s onward, an increasing amount of literature on Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages. Books such as ''[[Guardians of the North]]'' (1992) and ''[[Invaders from the North]]'' (2006) appeared from comics historian [[John Bell (historian)|John Bell]], who would become senior archivist at [[Library and Archives Canada]] in [[Ottawa]]. American magazine ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004.<ref name="CanadianComicsReferencesInPrint" /> In French, Michel Viau wrote an important book on francophone comics called ''BDQ: R<U+00E9>pertoire des publications de bandes dessin<U+00E9>es au Qu<U+00E9>bec des origines <U+00E0> nos jours'' (2000).<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" /> Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer has been writing about comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[Boston Globe]]'', as well as comics and literary magazines.<ref name="CRJeetInterview" />

Canadian [[Feminism|feminist]] scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-[[crime comics]] campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, from the point of view of the [[moral panic]] and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.<ref name="BeyondTheFunnies1989-2001" />
