The '''Great Heathen Army''' ([[Old English|OE:]] ''mycel heathen here''), also known as the '''Great Danish Army''' or '''The Great Viking Army''', was a combined [[Viking]] force originating in Denmark and southern Sweden that invaded England in 865 AD. Since the late 8th century the Vikings had settled for mainly "hit-and-run" raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was larger than raiding parties, however, and its purpose was to conquer.

The name is derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] of 865. The army was a combined force of Vikings from Scandinavia and probably Ireland, plus others who had been fighting campaigns elsewhere in Europe. Legend has it that the force was led by the sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]]. The campaign of invasion and conquest against the four remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms lasted fourteen years. Unlike many of the [[Norsemen|Scandinavian]] raiding armies of the period, surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was clearly among the largest forces of its kind.

The invaders initially landed in East Anglia where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865-66 at Thetford before marching north to capture York in November 866. During 868 they marched deep into Mercia and wintered in Nottingham, where they were besieged by a joint force from the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex. With no progress being made, the Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 869-70. In 870 the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. They moved to winter quarters in Thetford. In 871 the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] was content to pay them to leave. The army then marched to London to overwinter in 872 before moving back to Northumbria in 873. They again returned to Mercia, conquering it in 874. By this time only the kingdom of Wessex had not been conquered by the invading Vikings. It was towards the end of 875, when the army started their second invasion of Wessex. After a few setbacks, Alfred the Great defeated them at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed upon, whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.

==Background==
Viking raids began in England in the late 8th century, primarily on monasteries.<ref name=sawyer2>Sawyer. The Oxford Illustrated History of Vikings. pp. 2-3</ref> The first monastery to be raided was in 793 at Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described the Vikings as ''heathen men''.<ref name=asc793>ASC 793 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 16 January 2013</ref> Monasteries and [[Minster (church)|minster churches]] were popular targets as they were wealthy and had valuable objects that were portable.<ref name=starkey51>Starkey. The Monarchy of England. Vol. 1. p. 51</ref> The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 840 says that [[<U+00C6>thelwulf of Wessex]] was defeated at [[Carhampton]], [[Somerset]], after 35 Viking ships had landed in the area.<ref name=asc840>ASC 840 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 18 January 2013</ref> The [[Annals of St. Bertin]] also reported the incident, stating:
<blockquote>
''The Northmen launched a major attack on the island of Britain. After a battle lasting three days, the Northmen emerged the winners - plundering, looting, slaughtering everywhere. They wielded power over the land at will.''<ref name=nelson59>Nelson. The Annals of St-Bertin. p. 59 - The Annals of Bertin mention the attack as happening in 844 rather than 840 as in the ASC</ref>
</blockquote>
Despite this setback <U+00C6>thelwulf did have some success against the Vikings. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has repeated references during his reign of victories won by ealdormen with the men of their shires.<ref name=dnb1>Janet L. Nelson, <U+2018><U+00C6>thelwulf (d. 858)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8921, accessed 18 Jan 2013]</ref> However, the raiding of England continued on and off until the 860's, when instead of raiding the Viking changed their tactics and sent a great army to invade England. This army was described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as a "Great Heathen Army" (OE: ''mycel h<U+00E6><U+00FE>en here'' or ''mycel heathen here'').<ref name=asc865>ASC 865 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg].

===The size of the army===

Historians provide varying estimates for the size of the Great Heathen Army. According to the 'minimalist' scholars, such as Pete Sawyer, the army may have been smaller than traditionally thought.<ref name=sawyer124>Sawyer. The Age of Vikings. pp. 124-125</ref><ref name=halshall6>See Halshall's ''Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900'' Chapter 6 for a discussion on the size of medieval armies</ref> Sawyer notes that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 865 referred to the Viking force as a Heathen Army, or in [[Old English]] ''"h<U+00E6><U+00FE>en here"''.<ref name=sawyer124 /><ref name=gt1>[http://www8.georgetown.edu/departments/medieval/labyrinth/library/oe/texts/parker-phys.html Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 173, ff. 1v-32r.] Retrieved 17 April 2013. <br/>* The entry for 865 refers to the Heathen Army as ''h<U+00E6><U+00FE>en here''.<br/> * The entry for 866 describes the Great Army as ''micel here''.</ref> The [[Anglo-Saxon law|law code]] of [[Ine of Wessex|King Ine of Wessex]], issued in about 694, provides a definition of ''"here"'' as "an invading army or raiding party containing more than thirty five men", thus differentiating between the term for the invading Viking army and the Anglo-Saxon army that was referred to as the ''[[fyrd]]''.<ref name=sawyer124 /><ref name=attenborough40>Attenborough. [http://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/40/mode/2up The laws of the earliest English kings. pp. 40-41] - ''We use the term thieves if the number of men does not exceed seven. A band of marauders for a number between seven and thirty five. Anything beyond that is a raid'.''</ref>  Sawyer produced a table of Viking ship numbers, as documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and assumes that each Viking ship could carry no more than thirty two men, leading to his conclusion that the army would have consisted of no more than 1000 men.<ref name=sawyer124 />  Other scholars give higher estimates. For example, Laurent Mazet-Harhoff observes that many thousands of men were involved in the invasions of the Seine area. However he does say that the military bases that would accommodate these large  armies have yet to be rediscovered.<ref name=klaesoe81>Laurent Mazet-Harhoff. The Incursion of the Vikings into the natural and cultural landscape of upper Normandy ''in'' Iben Skibsted Klaesoe; Viking Trade and Settlement in Western Europe. p. 87</ref><ref>Bernard Bachrach, ''Charlemagne's Early Campaigns (768-777): A Diplomatic and Military Analysis.'' (Volume 82 of History of Warfare) BRILL, 2013. ISBN 9004224106, p. 77</ref> Guy Halshall reported that in the 1990s several historians suggested that the Great Heathen Army would have numbered in the low thousands; however Halshall advises that there "clearly is still much room for debate".<ref name=halshall6 />

The army probably developed from the campaigns in France. In [[Francia]] there was a conflict between [[Louis the Pious|the Emperor]] and his sons, and [[Lothair I|one of the sons]] had welcomed the support from a Viking fleet.<ref name=sawyer9>Sawyer. The Oxford Illustrated History of Vikings. pp. 9-11 and pp. 53-54</ref> By the time the war had ended, the Vikings had discovered that monasteries and towns situated on navigable rivers were vulnerable to attack. In 845 a raid on Paris was prevented by the large payment of silver to the Vikings. The opportunity for rich pickings drew other Vikings to the area, and by the end of the decade all the main rivers of West Francia were being patrolled by Viking fleets.<ref name=sawyer9 /> In 862 the [[Charles the Bald|West Frankish king]] responded to the Vikings, fortifying his towns and defending his rivers, thus making it difficult for the Vikings to raid inland. The lower reaches of the rivers and the coastal regions were left largely undefended. Religious communities in these areas, however, chose to move inland away from the reaches of the Viking fleets. With the changes in Francia making raiding more difficult, the Vikings turned their attention to England.<ref name=sawyer9 />

==Invasion of England==
Several of the Viking leaders who had been active in Francia joined forces to conquer the four kingdoms constituting [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. The composite force probably contained elements from Scandinavia and Ireland as well as those who had been fighting on the continent, although the Anglo-Saxon historian [[<U+00C6>thelweard (historian)|<U+00C6>thelweard]] was very specific in his chronicle and said that ''"the fleets of the Viking tyrant [[Ivar the Boneless]] landed in England from the north"''.<ref name=sawyer9 /><ref name=ethelweard25><U+00C6>thelweard. <U+00C6>thelweard's Chronicle. Bk.4. Ch. 2</ref> The Vikings had been defeated by the West Saxon King <U+00C6>thelwulf in 851, so rather than land in Wessex they decided to go further north to [[East Anglia]].<ref name=asc865 /><ref name=sawyer9 /><ref name=johan52>Br<U+00F8>ndsted.

Norse Mythology: Ragnar Lodbrok and His Sons. pp. 245-251</ref><ref name=jones219>Jones. A History of the Vikings. pp.218-219</ref>

===Start of the invasion, 865===
[[File:Ethelred coin.gif|thumb|200px|Silver penny of <U+00C6>thelred I, King of Wessex (865<U+2013>871)]]

In late 865 the Vikings landed in East Anglia and used it as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians made peace with the invader by providing them with horses.<ref name =ridyard65>Ridyard. The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England. p. 65</ref> The Vikings stayed in East Anglia for the winter before setting out for Northumbria towards the end of 866, establishing themselves at York. In 867 the Northumbrians [[Danegeld|paid them off]], and the Viking Army established a puppet leader in Northumbria before setting off for the [[Kingdom of Mercia]], where in 867 they captured Nottingham. The [[Burgred of Mercia|king of Mercia]] requested help from the Wessex king to help fight the Vikings. A combined army from Wessex and Mercia besieged the city of Nottingham with no clear result, so the Mercians settled on paying the Vikings off. The Vikings returned to Northumbria in autumn 868 and overwintered in York, staying there for most of 869. They returned to East Anglia and spent the winter of 869-70 at Thetford. There was no peace agreement between the East Anglians and the Vikings this time. When the local king Edmund fought against the invaders, he was captured and killed.<ref name=keyns16>Keynes/ Lapidge. Alfred the Great. pp.16-17</ref>

In 871, the Great Summer Army arrived from [[Scandinavia]], led by [[Bagsecg]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hooper |first=Nicholas Hooper |authorlink= |last2=Bennett |first2=Matthew |author2-link= |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: the Middle Ages |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |location= |page=22 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sf8UIynR0koC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-521-44049-1}}</ref> The reinforced Viking army turned its attention to Wessex, but the West Saxons, led by King [[<U+00C6>thelred of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelred]]'s brother Alfred, defeated them on 8 January 871 at the [[Battle of Ashdown]], slaying Bagsecq in the process. Three months later <U+00C6>thelred died and was succeeded by Alfred (later known as [[Alfred the Great]]), who was at first content to buy the Vikings off to gain time. During 871-72, the Great Heathen Army wintered in London before returning to Northumbria. It seems that there had been a rebellion against the puppet ruler in Northumbria, so they returned to restore power. They then established their winter quarters for 872-73 at [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Torksey]] in [[Lindsey]] (now part of [[Lincolnshire]]). The Mercians again paid them off in return for peace, and at the end of 873 the Vikings took up winter quarters at [[Repton]] in Derbyshire.<ref name=keyns18>Keynes/ Lapidge. Alfred the Great. pp.18-19</ref> 

In 874, following their winter stay in Repton, the Great Heathen Army drove the Mercian king into exile and finally conquered Mercia; the exiled Mercian king was replaced by [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceowulf]]. According to Alfred the Great's biographer, [[Asser]], the Vikings then split into two bands.<ref name=asser82>Asser. Life of Alfred ''in'' Keyns/ Lapidge. Alfred the Great. p. 82</ref><ref name=sawyer55>Sawyer. Illustrated History of Viking. p. 55</ref> Halfdan led one band north to Northumbria, where he overwintered by the river Tyne (874-75). In 875 he ravaged further north to Scotland, where he fought the [[Picts]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Britons of Strathclyde]].<ref name=holman117>Holman. The A to Z of the Vikings. p.117</ref> Returning south of the border in 876, he shared out Northumbrian land amongst his men, who 'ploughed the land and supported themselves', part of what became known as the [[Danelaw]].<ref name=sawyer55 />

===King Alfred's victory===

According to Asser, the second band was led by [[Guthrum]], Oscetel, and Anwend. This group also left Repton in 874 and established a base at Cambridge for the winter of 874-75. In late 875 they moved onto [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], where they raided the surrounding area and occupied a fortified position. Asser reports that Alfred made a treaty with the Vikings to get them to leave Wessex.<ref name=asser82 /><ref name=stenton117>Stenton. Anglo Saxon England. p. 253</ref>  The Vikings left Wareham, but it was not long before they were raiding other parts of Wessex, and initially they were successful. Alfred fought back, however, and eventually won victory over them at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. This was followed closely by what was described by Asser as the [[Treaty of Wedmore]], under which England was divided between the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex and the Vikings. Guthrum also agreed to be baptised.<ref name=smyth26>Smyth. The Medieval Life of Alfred. pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Derby Museum Viking Sword.jpg|thumb|right|A sword of a Viking buried at Repton in Mercia. This sword is now in Derby Museum.<ref name="bbc"/>]]
In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester, in the kingdom of Mercia.<ref name=asc878>ASC 878 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 16 January 2013</ref> Then, probably in late 879, it moved to East Anglia,<ref name=asc879>ASC 879 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 16 January 2013</ref> where Guthrum, who was also known by his baptismal name of Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890.<ref name=asc890>ASC 890 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 16 January 2013</ref>

The part of the army that did not go with Guthrum mostly went onto more settled lives in Northumbria and York. Some may have settled in Mercia. Evidence for this is the presence of two Viking cemeteries in modern-day Derbyshire that are believed to be connected to the ''Great Army'', at Repton and at [[Heath Wood barrow cemetery|Heath Wood]].<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian|coauthors=et al.|title=Excavations at the Viking barrow cemetery at Heath Wood, Ingleby, Derbyshire|journal=Antiquaries J.|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/635/1/richardsjd1.pdf|year=2004|issue=84|pages=23<U+2013>116}}</ref> An excavation of the Repton site between 1980-86 revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 250 people, including some women. They may have suffered some sort of epidemic when the army overwintered in Repton during 873-74, leading to the mass burial.<ref name=sawyer55 /> The nearby cemetery at Heath Wood contains about sixty cremations (rather than burials). Finds of cremation sites in the British Isles are very rare, and this one probably was the war cemetery of the Great Heathen Army.<ref name=richards2004 />

In 878, a third Viking army gathered on the Thames. It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred<U+2019>s success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Frankia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage. The assembled Viking army on the Thames departed in 879 to begin new campaigns on the continent.<ref name=sawyer57>Sawyer. Illustrated History of Viking. p. 57</ref><ref name=sawyer91>Sawyer. Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe. p. 91</ref>

The rampaging Viking army on the continent encouraged Alfred to protect his Kingdom of Wessex. He built a navy, reorganised the army, and set up a system of fortified towns known as [[burh]]s. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications.<ref name=sawyer57 /><ref name=starkey63>Starkey. Monarchy. p.63</ref> Historically, every freeman in the land could be called out to protect the realm in times of trouble. Unfortunately, the speed of Viking hit-and-run raids had been too quick for the local militias to act, so part of Alfred's reforms were to create a standing army that could react rapidly to attacks. The Anglo-Saxon rural population lived within a 24&nbsp;km(15 mile) radius of each burh, so they were able to seek refuge when necessary.<ref name=welch127>Welch. Anglo-Saxon England. pp. 127 &ndash; 129</ref> To maintain the burhs, as well as the standing army, Alfred set up a system of taxation and [[conscription]] that is recorded in a document, now known as the [[Burghal Hidage]].<ref name=horspool102>Horspool. Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes. p.102</ref> 

By 896, the remains of the Danish army that had not gone to East Anglia or Northumbria found it difficult to make any progress in  Alfred's fortified kingdom, so according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' those that were penniless found themselves ships and went south across the sea to the Seine.<ref name=sawyer92>Sawyer. Kings and Vikings. p. 92</ref><ref name=asc897>ASC 897- English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html project Gutenberg]. Retrieved 16 January 2013</ref> As for Anglo-Saxon England, it had been torn apart by the invading Great Heathen Army, and the Vikings were now in control of northern and eastern England, while Alfred and his successors remained in control of Wessex.<ref name=kirby178>Kirby.
