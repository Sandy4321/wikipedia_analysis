The '''First World War''', or (before [[1939]]) the '''Great War''' was a [[World war|world conflict]] lasting from August [[1914]] to the final [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] on [[November 11]], [[1918]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] (led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Russia]] (until [[1917]]), and the [[United States]] (after 1917)), defeated the [[Central Powers]] (led by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]). The war caused the collapse of four empires and a radical change in the map of Europe and the Middle East. The Allied powers before 1917 are sometimes referred to as the Triple Entente, and the Central Powers are sometimes referred to as the Triple Alliance.

==Introduction==
Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]], embodied within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a "[[No man's land]]") running from the [[North Sea]] to the border of Switzerland. On the [[Eastern Front (WWI)|Eastern Front]], the two sides battled on just as great a scale, but the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing. Hostilities were also prosecuted by fighting on and under the sea and - for the first time - from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts.

Ultimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century national revolutions, the processes of European or created by the war would be highly important factors in the outbreak, within 20 years, of [[World War II]].

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
[[Image:Sarajevo Attentat.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[assassination in Sarajevo]]; this event proved to be the catalyst for a wide-ranging war in Europe]]
On [[June 28]], [[1914]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the Austrian throne, was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]] of [[Young Bosnia]], a group whose aims included the unification of the South Slavs and independence from Austria (see also: the [[Black Hand]]). The [[assassination in Sarajevo]] set into motion a series of fast-moving [[World War I#July Crisis and the Declarations of War|events]] that escalated into a full-scale war. However, the reasons behind the conflict are multiple and complex. Historians and political scientists have grappled with this question for nearly a century without reaching a consensus. 

====The verdict at Versailles====
The "official" explanation lies in Article 231 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], often referred to as the "War Guilt" Clause. The argument was that Austria, backed by Berlin, attacked Serbia on [[July 29]] and Germany invaded Belgium on [[August 3]]. Thus, Germany and Austria-Hungary were interpreted to be the initial aggressors, and therefore were seen as responsible for the outbreak of war. While the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] government accepted the Clause, it had done so under complicated circumstances including continued economic blockade and the threat of renewed hostilities. Consequently, Germany was punished for its alleged responsibility, creating an atmosphere in the country that helped the [[Nazi Party]] rise to power.

Since 1961, the theory that Germany was primarily responsible for the war has been promoted by academics such as [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Imanuel Geiss]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Wolfgang Mommsen]] and [[V.R. Berghahn]]. Fischer contended that Germany wanted to control most of Europe or, at the very least, unite it economically ''through'' the country. However, as he points out, diplomatic efforts to do so often centered around Anglo-Germanic cooperation and not war.

====Alliances ====
Political scientists emphasize the building of alliances, specifically the formation of the [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance]]. While the alliances emboldened participating nations and led each into believing they had a powerful backing, the issue was even more complex; each camp functioned in a unique way that contributed to the spread of war. For the Triple Alliance, the strong relationship between Germany and Austria expanded the conflict to a level where it would include at least four participants. Russia, France and Britain had a relationship that was much less certain, contributing to the fact that each made the decision to go to war without collaborative consultation and with their own interests in mind. 


====Arms races ====
The naval arms race between Germany and Great Britain was drastically intensified by the 1906 launch of the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS Dreadnought]], a revolutionary battleship that rendered all previous battleships obsolete. This weakened Britain's relative power as a seafaring nation, as the new type of vessel opened up a new chapter in naval warfare, annihilating the old ''status-quo''. Consequently, a major naval [[arms race]] in shipbuilding developed, tying in with the concept of [[new imperialism]] and further creating a need for alliances. [[Paul Kennedy]] has promulgated the thesis that both nations adopted [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred T. Mahan]]'s conclusion that control of the oceans was vital to a great nation. Additionally, this goal kept industries active and unemployment down, and it minimized internal strife through the focus on a common, patriotic goal. 

[[David Stevenson]] described the armaments race as a "a self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness", while [[David Herrmann]] viewed the shipbuilding rivalry as part of a general movement towards war. However, [[Niall Ferguson]] argues that Britain's ability to maintain an overall advantage signifies that change within this realm was insignificant and therefore, not a factor in the movement towards war.

====Plans, distrust and mobilization: The ''First out of the Gate'' theory====
Closely related is the thesis adopted by many political scientists that the war plans of Germany, France and Russia automatically escalated the conflict. Fritz Fischer and his followers have emphasized the inherently aggressive nature of Germany's [[Schlieffen Plan]], which outlined German strategy if at war with both France and Russia. Conflict on two fronts meant that Germany had to eliminate one opponent quickly before taking on the other, relying on a strict timetable. France's well defended border with Germany  meant that an attack through Belgian (and possibly Dutch) territory was a neccessity, creating a number of unexpected problems. In a greater context, France's own [[Plan XVII]] called for an offensive thrust into Germany's industrial [[Ruhr Valley]], crippling Germany's ability to wage war. Russia's revised Plan XIX implied a mobilization of its armies against both Austria-Hungary and Germany. All three created an atmosphere where generals and planning staffs were anxious to take the initiative and seize decisive victories. These elaborate mobilization plans with precise timetables. Once the mobilization orders were issued, it was understood by both generals and statesmen alike that there was little or no possibility of turning back or a key advantage would be sacrificed. Furthermore, the problem of communications in 1914 should not be underestimated; all nations still used [[telegraphy]] and ambassadors as the main form of communication, which resulted in delays from hours to even days.

====Militarism and autocracy====
President of the United States [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other observers blamed the war on [[militarism]]. The idea was that aristocrats and military elites had too much control over Germany, Russia and Austria, and the war was a consequence of their thirst for military power and disdain for [[democracy]]. This was a theme that figured prominently in anti-German propaganda, which cast Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and Prussian military tradition in a negative light. Consequently, supporters of this theory called for the abdication of such rulers, the end of the aristocratic system and the end of militarism&mdash;all of which justified American entry into the war once Czarist Russia dropped out of the Allied camp. Wilson hoped the [[League of Nations]] and universal disarmament would secure a lasting peace. He also acknowledged variations of militarism in the British and French political systems.{{fn|1}}

====Economic imperialism====
[[Lenin]] famously asserted that the worldwide system of [[imperialism]] was responsible for the war. In this he drew upon the economic theories of English economist [[John A. Hobson]], who, in his 1902 book entitled 'Imperialism'[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902hobson.html], had earlier predicted the outcome of economic imperialism, or unlimited competition for expanding markets, would lead to a global military conflict. This argument proved persuasive in the immediate wake of the war and assisted in the rise of [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]]. Lenin's 1917 pamphlet "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism" [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/] made the argument, specifically, that large banking interests in the various capitalist-imperialist powers had pulled the strings in the various governments and led them into the war.

====Nationalism and romanticism====
The civilian leaders of the European powers found themselves facing a wave of [[nationalism|nationalist]] zeal that had been building across Europe for years, as memories of war faded or were convoluted into a [[romanticism|romantic]] fantasy that resonated in the public conscience. Frantic diplomatic efforts to mediate the Austrian-Serbian quarrel simply became irrelevant, as public and elite opinion commonly demanded war to uphold national honor. Most of the belligerents envisioned swift victory and glorious consequences. The patriotic enthusiasm, unity and ultimate euphoria that took hold during the ''[[Spirit of 1914]]'' was full of that very optimism regarding the post-war future. Also, the Socialist-Democratic movement had begun to exert pressure on aristocrats throughout Europe, who optimistically hoped that victory would reunite their countries via the consolidation of their domestic hegemony. However, [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] were among those who predicted that modern, industrialized warfare would be a lengthy excursion. Others, such as [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Bethmann Hollweg]], were concerned by the potential social consequences of a war. International bond and financial markets entered severe crises in late July and early August reflecting worry about the financial consequences of war. Nevertheless, spurred on by propaganda and nationalist fervor, many eagerly joined the ranks in search of adventure.

====Culmination of European history====
A localized war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia was almost assured because of Austria-Hungary's deteriorating world position and the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] separatist movement in the [[Balkans]], which had the support of the Russian Empire. The decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which had formerly held sway over much of the Balkans, led to a rivalry between Austria-Hungary and Russia for regional hegemony. Russia supported the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] separatist movement there, motivated by ethnic loyalties and its centuries-old dream of a [[warm water port]].{{fn|2}}[http://web.mit.edu/mun/bosmun/RussianUpdate.pdf] For the Germans, both the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and [[Thirty Year's War]] were characterized by incursions which had a lasting psychological effect; it was Germany's precarious position in the center of Europe that ultimately led to the decision for an active defense, culminating in the Schlieffen Plan.{{fn|3}} At the same time, the transfer of the contested [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] territories and defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] influenced France's policy, characterized by [[revanchism]]. However, after the [[League of the Three Emperors]] fell apart, the French formed an alliance with Russia and a two-front war became a distinct possibility for Germany.

==Participants in World War I==
{{main|Participants in World War I}}

The warring parties were divided into two camps:
* [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]
* [[Central Powers]]

==July crisis and declarations of war==
After the assassination of the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] on [[June 28]], [[1914]], Austria-Hungary waited for 3 weeks before deciding on a course of action. This wait was because the army was on leave to help in gathering the harvest, which practically denied Austria the possibility of military action at the time. On July 23, assured by unconditional support of the Germans should war break out, it sent an [[July Ultimatum|ultimatum]] to Serbia containing many demands, among them that Austrian agents would be allowed to take part in the investigation, and in general holding Serbia responsible for the assassination. The Serbian government accepted all the terms, except that of the participation of the Austrian agents in the inquiry, which it saw as a violation of its sovereignty. Emboldened by last minute Russian support, Serbia rejected the ultimatum. Austria-Hungary, in turn, rejected the Serbian reply on July 26. Breaking diplomatic relations, the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia on July 28 and proceeded to bombard Belgrade on July 29. On July 30, Austria-Hungary and Russia both ordered general mobilization of their armies.

The Germans, having pledged their support to Austria-Hungary, sent Russia an ultimatum on July 31 to stop mobilization within 12 hours. On August 1, with the ultimatum expired, the German ambassador to Russia formally declared war. On August 2, Germany occupied Luxembourg, as a preliminary step to the invasion of Belgium and the [[Schlieffen Plan]] (Germany had planned to attack France first according to the plan, and then Russia, which had already gone wrong). The same day, yet another ultimatum was delivered to Belgium, requesting free passage for the German army on the way to France. The Belgians refused. At the very last moment, the Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] asked [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Moltke]], the German Chief of General Staff, to cancel the invasion of France in the hope this would keep Britain out of the war. Moltke, horrified by the prospect of the utter ruin of the Schlieffen Plan, refused on the grounds that it would be impossible to change the rail schedule&mdash;"once settled, it cannot be altered" <ref>Moltke's memoir, pages 19-23, quoted in Tuchman's ''The Guns of August'', page xxx </ref>. On August 3, Germany declared war on France and  invaded Belgium on August 4. This act&mdash;violating Belgian neutrality to which Germany, France, and Britain were all committed to guarantee&mdash;gave Britain, which up to that point had yet to choose a side in the conflict, a reason to declare war on Germany on August 4.

==Opening hostilities==
===Africa and Pacific===
Some of the first hostilities of the war occurred in [[Africa]] and in the [[Pacific Ocean]], in the colonies and territories of the European powers. In August 1914, French and British Empire forces invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]] in [[West Africa]]. Shortly thereafter, on August 10, German forces based in [[Namibia|South-West Africa]] attacked [[South Africa]], which was then part of the British Empire. [[New Zealand]], occupied [[Western Samoa|German Samoa]] (later Western Samoa) on August 30. On September 11, the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. [[Japan]] seized Germany's [[Micronesia]]n colonies and the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]], in the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific. Sporadic and fierce fighting, however, continued in Africa for the remainder of the war.

[[Image:Europe 1914.jpg|left|thumb|250px|European military alliances in 1915. The [[Central Powers]] are depicted in puce, the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] in grey and neutral countries in yellow]]

===Europe===
In Europe, the Central Powers&mdash;the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire&mdash;suffered from mutual miscommunication and lack of intelligence regarding the intentions of each other's army. Germany had originally guaranteed to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia but practical interpretation of this idea differed. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover the northern flank against Russia. Germany, however, had planned for Austria-Hungary to focus the majority of its troops on Russia while Germany dealt with France on the Western Front. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian army]] to split its troop concentrations.  Somewhat more than half of the army went to fight the Russians on their border, and the remainder was allocated to invade and conquer Serbia.

===Serbian Campaign===
{{main|Serbian Campaign %28WWI%29}} <br />
The Serbian army fought a defensive battle against the invading Austrian army (called the [[Battle of Cer]]) starting on August 12. The Serbians occupied defensive positions on the south side of the [[Drina]] and Save rivers. Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses. This marked the first major Allied victory of the war. Austrian expectations of a swift victory over Serbia were not realized and as a result, Austria had to keep a very sizable force on  the Serbian front, which weakened their armies facing Russia.

===Germany in Belgium and France===
After entering Belgian territory, the German army soon encountered resistance at a fortified [[Li<U+00E8>ge (city)|Li<U+00E8>ge]]. Although the army as a whole continued to make rapid progress into France, it was Britain's decision to honor a dated protection pact with Belgium and to declare war on Germany that left the German government in disbelief and seriously hindered their military plans. Britain sent an army to France (the [[British Expeditionary Force]], or BEF) which advanced into Belgium and slowed the Germans. The first British soldier killed in the war was [[John Parr (soldier)|John Parr]], on [[August 21]] [[1914]], near Mons.

Initially, the Germans had great successes in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14&ndash;[[24 August]] [[1914]]). However, Russia attacked in [[East Prussia]] and diverted German forces which were intended for the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the Second [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (August 17&ndash;September 2). This diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from railheads not allowed for by the German [[General Staff]]. It also allowed French and British forces to finally halt the German advance on Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (September 1914) and the Entente forced the Central Powers to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself in the months of August and September. Yet staff incompetence and leadership timidity (such as [[Moltke the Younger]] needlessly transferring troops from the right to protect [[Sedan, France|Sedan]]) cost Germany the chance for an early victory over France with its very ambitious war plan.

==Early stages==
[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|right|thumb|190px|In the trenches: Infantry with [[gas mask]]s, [[Ypres]], 1917.]]
===Trench warfare begins===
{{main|Western Front (World War I)}}
Advances in military technology meant that defensive firepower out-weighed offensive capabilities, making the war particularly murderous, as tactics had failed to keep up. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances; [[artillery]], now vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine gun]]s, made crossing open ground a nightmarish prospect. Germans began using [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] in 1915, and soon, both sides were using gas. Neither side ever won a battle with gas, but it made life even more miserable in the trenches and became one of the most feared, and longest remembered, horrors of the war. Unfortunately, few drastic changes in tactics could have been made even if the military leaders of the time were open to them. The war saw the invention of [[Tank|tanks]] as another attempt to break the trench warfare stalemate.  They were primarily used by the British and French, though the Germans used captured Allied tanks and a small number of their own design.

After the [[First Battle of the Marne]], both Entente and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvres to try to force the other to retreat, in the so-called [[Race to the Sea]]. The United Kingdom and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German positions from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's [[Flanders|Flemish]] coast. The United Kingdom and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended occupied territories. One consequence was that German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy: Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be 'temporary' before their forces broke through German defences. Some hoped to break the stalemate by utilizing science and technology. In April 1915, the Germans used [[chlorine gas]], for the first time, which opened a 6 kilometer (4 mi) wide hole in the Allied lines when French colonial troops retreated before it. This breach was closed by allied soldiers at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] (where over 5,000 mainly [[Canadian]] soldiers were gassed to death) and [[Third Battle of Ypres]], where [[Canadian]] forces took the village of [[Passchendale]] with the help of allied powers.

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next four years, though protracted German action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] throughout 1916, and the Entente's failure at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], in the summer of 1916, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts at frontal assault&mdash;with a rigid adherence to unimaginative manoeuver&mdash;came at a high price for both the British and the French [[poilu]] (infantry) and led to widespread mutinies especially during the time of the [[Nivelle Offensive]] in the spring of 1917. News of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] gave a new incentive to socialist sentiments among the troops, with its seemingly inherent promise of peace. Red flags were hoisted, and the [[Internationale]] was sung on several occasions. At the height of the mutiny, 30,000 to 40,000 French soldiers participated.
[[Image:Canadian tank and soldiers Vimy 1917.jpg||left|thumb|200px|[[Canadian]] troops advancing behind a tank at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]].]]
 
Throughout 1915-17, the British Empire and France suffered far more casualties than Germany. However, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at [[Verdun]], each failed attempt by the Entente to break through German lines was met with an equally fierce German counteroffensive to recapture lost positions. Around 800,000 soldiers from the British Empire were on the Western Front at any one time. 1,000 battalions, each occupying a sector of the line from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Orne River (Lorraine)|Orne River]], operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over 9,600 kilometers (6,000 mi) of trenches. Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the [[Poperinge]] or [[Amiens]] areas.

In the British-led [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] during the 1917 campaign, the only military success was the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] by the Canadian forces under [[Sir Arthur Currie]] and [[Julian Byng]]. It provided the British allies with great military advantage that had a lasting impact on the war and is considered by many historians as the [[founding myth]] of Canada.

==Southern theatres==
===Ottoman Empire===
{{main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}} {{Russo-Ottoman War Series}}
The [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers in October and November 1914, because of the secret [[Turko-German Alliance]], which was signed in August 1914. It threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with [[India]] and the East via the [[Suez canal]]. The British Empire opened another front in the South with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamian]] campaigns. In Gallipoli, the [[Turkey|Turks]] were successful in repelling the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) and  forced their eventual withdrawal and evacuation. In [[Mesopotamia]], by contrast, after the disastrous [[Siege of Kut]] (1915&ndash;16), British Empire forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. Further to the west in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]], initial British failures were overcome when [[Jerusalem]] was captured in December 1917, and the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], under Field Marshall [[Edmund Allenby]], broke the Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918.

Russian armies generally had the best of it in the [[Caucasus]].
''Vice-Generalissimo'' [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Turkish armed forces, was a very [[Ambition|ambitious]] man with a dream to conquer [[Central Asia|central Asia]]. He was not, however, a practical soldier. He launched an offensive with 100,000 troops against the Russians in the Caucasus in December of 1914. Insisting on a frontal attack against Russian positions in the mountains in the heart of winter, Enver lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamis]]. 

The Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, General [[Nikolai_Nikolaevich_Yudenich|Yudenich]], with a string of victories over the Ottoman forces, drove the Turks out of much of present-day [[Armenia]], and tragically provided a context for the [[deportation]] and [[Armenian_Genocide|genocide]] against the [[Armenians|Armenian]] population in eastern Armenia. 

In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed senior control over the Caucasus front. Nicholas tried to have a railway built from [[Georgia (country)|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories with a view to bringing up more supplies for a new offensive in 1917. But, in March of 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the [[February Revolution]] and the Russian army began to slowly fall apart.

===Italian participation===
{{main|Italian Campaign (World War I)}}
[[Italy]] had been allied to the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882. Italy had its own designs against Austrian territory in the [[Trentino]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]], and maintained a secret 1902 understanding with France, which effectively nullified its alliance commitments. Italy refused to join Germany and Austria-Hungary at the beginning of the war because their alliance was defensive. The Austrian government started negotiations to obtain Italian neutrality in exchange for French territories ([[Tunisia]]), but Italy joined the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] by signing the [[London Pact]] in April and declaring war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915; it declared war against Germany fifteen months later.

In general, the Italians had numerical superiority but were poorly equipped. The Italians went on the offensive to relieve pressure on the other Allied fronts and achieve their territorial goals. In the [[Trentino-South Tyrol|Trentino]] front, the Austro-Hungarian defence took advantage of the elevation of their bases in the mostly [[mountainous]] terrain, which was not suitable for military offensives. After an initial Austro-Hungaric strategic retreat to better positions, the front remained mostly unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaisersch<U+00FC>tzen]] and [[Standsch<U+00FC>tzen]] and Italian [[Alpini Corps|Alpini]] fought bitter close combat battles during summer and tried to survive during winter in the high mountains. The Austro-Hungarians counter-attacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]] towards Verona and Padua in the spring of 1916 (''Strafexpedition''), but they also made little progress.

Beginning in 1915, the Italians mounted 11 major offensives along the Isonzo river north of [[Trieste]], known as the First through Eleventh Battles of the [[So<U+010D>a River|Isonzo]].  These attacks were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians who had the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained practically stable for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the fall of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austrians received large reinforcements, including German assault troops.  The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on October the 26th that was spearheaded by German troops and supported by the Austrians and Hungarians.  The attack resulted in the victory of [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]]: the Italian army was routed, but after retreating more than 100km, it was able to reorganise and hold at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. In 1918, the Austrians repeatedly failed to break the Italian line, and, decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], surrendered to the Entente powers in November.

===War in the Balkans===
{{main|Serbian_Campaign_%28WWI%29}} <br />

Faced with the Russian threat, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army for [[Serbia]]. After suffering tremendous losses, the Austrians briefly captured the Serbian capital, but Serb counterattacks succeeded in expelling the invaders from the country by the end of 1914.  For the first 10 months of 1915. Austria used most of its spare armies to fight Italy. However, German and Austria diplomats scored a great coup by convincing [[Bulgaria]] to join in a new attack on Serbia. 

The conquest of Serbia was finally accomplished in a little more than a month, starting on October 7, when the Austrians and Germans attacked from the north. Four days later the Bulgarians attacked from the east. The Serbian army, attacked from two directions and facing certain defeat, retreated east and south into [[Albania]], and then by ship to [[Greece]]. In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure the Greek government into war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-allied Greek government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] was dismissed, by the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], before the allied expeditionary force had even arrived. 

The Salonica Front proved entirely immobile, so much so that it was joked that Salonica was the largest German [[prisoner of war]] camp. Only at the very end of the war were the Entente powers able to make a breakthrough, which was after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been removed, leaving the Front held by the Bulgarians alone. This led to Bulgaria's signing an [[armistice]] on [[September 29]], [[1918]].

==Eastern Front==
===Initial actions===
[[Image:GermanTrenchNearTheMazuricLakesOnTheEasternFront.jpg|thumb|right|235px|A German trench in the swamp area near the Mazuric Lakes on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Picture taken in February 1915, just before the German winter-offensive started in heavy snowstorms.]]
{{main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}

While the Western Front had reached stalemate in the trenches, the war continued in the east. The Russian initial plans for war had called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and German [[East Prussia]]. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, they were driven back from East Prussia by the victories of the German generals [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and the [[Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914. Russia's less-developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians were driven back in Galicia, and in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on [[Poland]]'s southern fringes, capturing [[Warsaw]] on [[August 5]] and forcing the Russians to withdraw from all of Poland. This became known as the "Great Retreat" by the Russian Empire and the "Great Advance" by Germany.

===Russian Revolution===
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}
Dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew despite the success of the June 1916 [[Brusilov offensive]] in eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] against the Austrians.  The Russian success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces in support of the victorious sector commander. Allied and Russian forces revived only temporarily with [[Romania]]'s entry into the war on [[August 27]]: German forces came to the aid of embattled Austrian units in [[Transylvania]], and [[Bucharest]] fell to the Central Powers on [[December 6]]. Meanwhile, internal unrest grew in Russia as the [[Nicholas II of Russia|czar]] remained out of touch at the front. [[Alexandra of Hesse|Empress Alexandra]]'s increasingly incompetent rule drew protests from all segments of Russian political life and resulted in the murder of Alexandra's favorite [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] by conservative noblemen at the end of 1916.

[[Image:Lenin.WWI.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Vladimir Lenin]]]]

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]] culminated in the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]], which shared power with the socialists of the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. This division of power led to confusion and chaos both on the front and at home, and the army became increasingly ineffective.

The war, and the government, became more and more unpopular, and the discontent led to a rise in popularity of the [[Bolshevik]] [[political party|party]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], who were able to gain power. The [[October Revolution|triumph of the Bolsheviks]] in November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused to agree to the harsh German terms, but when Germany resumed the war and marched with impunity across [[Ukraine]], the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on [[March 3]] [[1918]], which took Russia out of the war and ceded vast territories, including [[Finland]], the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] to the Central Powers.

After the Russians dropped out of the war, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led a small-scale invasion of Russia. The invasion was made with intent primarily to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the Whites in the Russian Revolution. Troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] (see [[North Russia Campaign]]) and in [[Vladivostok]].

==1917-18==
[[Image:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|right|thumb|235px|In the [[trench]]es: A carrying party of the [[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench on the [[first day on the Somme]], July 1 1916]]

Events of 1917 would prove decisive in ending the war, although their effects would not be fully felt until 1918. The British naval blockade of Germany began to have a serious impact on morale and productivity on the German home front. In response, in February 1917, the German General Staff ([[Oberste Heeresleitung|OHL]]) was able to convince [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], with the goal of starving the United Kingdom out of the war. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000 tons per month from February until July, peaking at 860,000 tons in April. After July, the reintroduced [[convoy]] system was extremely effective in neutralizing the [[U-boat]] threat, thanks to American experimentation. Britain was safe from the threat of starvation, and the German war industry remained deprived materially. 

The decisive victory of Germany at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] led to the Allied decision at the [[Rapallo Conference]] to form the [[Supreme Allied Council]] at [[Versailles]] to coordinate plans and action. Previously British and French armies had operated under separate command systems.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thereby releasing troops from the eastern front for use in the west. Ironically, German troop transfers could have been greater if their territorial acquisitions had not been so dramatic. With both German reinforcements and new [[United States|American]] troops pouring into the Western Front, the final outcome of the war was to be decided in that front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war now that American forces were certain to be arriving in increasing numbers, but they held high hopes for a rapid offensive in the West using their reinforced troops and new infantry tactics. Furthermore, the rulers of both the Central Powers and the Allies became more fearful of the threat first raised by [[Ivan Bloch]] in 1899, that protracted industrialized war threatened social collapse and revolution throughout Europe. Both sides urgently sought a decisive, rapid victory on the Western Front because they were both fearful of collapse or stalemate.

===Entry of the United States===
[[Image:Wilson announcing the break in the official relations with Germany.jpg|thumb|235px|President Wilson before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on [[February 3]] [[1917]].]]

America's policy of insisting on neutral rights while also trying to broker a peace resulted in tensions with both Berlin and London. U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] repeatedly warned that he would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Germans repeatedly promised to stop. A proposal to [[Mexico]] to join the war against the Allies was exposed in February, bringing war closer. (See [[Zimmermann telegram]]).  After further U-boat (German submarines) attacks on American merchant ships, Wilson requested that Congress declare war on Germany, which it did on [[April 6]], [[1917]] (see: ''[[wikisource:Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany|Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany]]'' on [[Wikisource]]). The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] approved the war resolution 373-50, the [[U.S. Senate]] 82-6, with opposition coming mostly from [[German American]] districts. Wilson hoped war could be avoided with Austria-Hungary; however, when it kept its loyalty to Germany, the U.S. declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] in December 1917.

Although the American contribution to the war was important, particularly in terms of the threat posed by an increasing U.S. infantry presence in Europe, the United States was never formally a member of the Allies but an "Associated Power". Significant numbers of fresh American troops arrived in Europe in the summer of 1918, and they started arriving at 10,000 per day.

Germany miscalculated that it would be many more months before large numbers of American troops could be sent to Europe, and that, in any event, the U-boat offensive would prevent their arrival.

The [[United States Navy]] sent a battleship group to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the [[British Grand Fleet]], several [[destroyers]] to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], Ireland and several [[submarines]] to the [[Azores]] and to [[Bantry Bay]], Ireland to help guard [[convoy]]s. Several regiments of [[U.S. Marines]] were also dispatched to France. However, it would be some time before the United States would be able to contribute significant manpower to the Western and Italian fronts.

The British and French wanted the United States to send its infantry to reinforce their troops already on the battlelines, and not use scarce shipping to bring over supplies. Thus the Americans primarily used British and French artillery, airplanes and tanks. However, General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units (though he did allow [[African American]] combat units to be used by the French). Pershing ordered the use of frontal assaults, which had been discarded by that time by British Empire and French commanders as too costly in lives of their troops. To the astonishment of the Allies, the dispirited Germans broke and ran when the Americans came running, and the AEF suffered the lowest casualty rate of any army on the Western Front, with most recorded deaths being attributed to disease.


===German Spring Offensive of 1918===
[[Image:trencheswwi2.jpg|right|thumb|235px|For most of World War I, Allied forces were stalled at trenches on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]]]
{{main|Spring Offensive}}

German General [[Erich Ludendorff]] drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for a 1918 general offensive along the [[Western Front]]. This [[Spring Offensive]] sought to divide the British Empire and French armies in a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow against the enemy before significant United States forces could be deployed. Before the offensive even began, Ludendorff made what may have been a fatal mistake by leaving the elite [[German Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] in Russia and sending over only a small portion of the German forces from the east to aid the offensive in the west.

Operation Michael opened on [[March 21]] [[1918]], with an attack against British Empire forces near the rail junction at [[Amiens]]. Ludendorff's intention was to split the British Empire and French armies at this point. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometers (40 mi). For the first time since 1914, maneuvering was achieved on the battlefield.

British and French trenches were defeated using novel [[infiltration tactics]]. Up to this time, attacks had been characterized by long artillery bombardments and continuous-front mass assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive, the German Army used artillery briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points, attacking command and logistics areas and surrounding points of serious resistance. These isolated positions were then destroyed by more heavily armed infantry. German success relied greatly on this tactic.

The front line had now moved to within 120 kilometers (75 mi) of Paris. Three super-heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s advanced and fired 183 shells on Paris, which caused many Parisians to flee the city. The initial stages of the offensive were so successful that German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared [[March 24]] a national holiday. Many Germans thought victory was close; however, after heavy fighting, the German offensive was halted. The Germans had brilliant new stormtrooper, or [[Hutier]] tactics that avoided the trenches and sent small units on preplanned raids deep behind the lines to control and communication centers. That worked very well, but the Germans, lacking tanks or motorized artillery, were unable to consolidate their positions. The British and French learned that they had to fall back a few miles and the Germans would be disorganized and vulnerable to counterattack.  

American divisions, which Pershing had sought to field as an independent force, were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on [[March 28]]. A supreme command of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference, in which British Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]] handed control of his forces over to [[Ferdinand Foch]].

Following [[Operation Michael]], Germany launched [[Operation Georgette]] to the north against the [[English channel|Channel]] ports. This was halted by the Allies with less significant territorial gains to Germany. [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl<U+00FC>cher and Yorck]] were then conducted by the German Army to the south, broadly towards Paris. Next, Operation Marne was launched on [[July 15]] as an attempt to encircle [[Reims]], beginning the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The resulting Allied counterattack marked their first successful offensive of the war. By [[July 20]], the Germans were back at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines, having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the ground war in the West, the German Army never again held the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many of the highly trained stormtroopers. Their best soldiers were gone just as the Americans started arriving.

Meanwhile, Germany was crumbling internally as well. Anti-war marches were a frequent occurrence and morale within the army was at low levels. Industrial output had fallen 53% from 1913.

===Allied victory: summer and autumn 1918===
[[Image:Battle of St. Mihiel 03.jpg|right|thumb|235px|American engineers returning from the front during the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] in September 1918]]
{{main articles|[[Hundred Days Offensive]] and [[Weimar Republic]]}}

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] began on [[August 8]] [[1918]]. The [[Battle of Amiens]] developed with III Corps [[British Fourth Army|Fourth British Army]] on the left, the [[French First Army|First French Army]] on the right, and the [[Canadian Corps|Canadian]] and [[Australian Corps]] spearheading the offensive in the centre. It involved 414 [[tank]]s of the [[Mark I (tank)|Mark IV]] and [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V Series|Mark V]] type, and 120,000 men. They advanced as far as 12 kilometers (7 mi) into German-held territory in just seven hours. [[Erich Ludendorff]] referred to this day as "the Black Day of the German army".

However, after a few days, the offensive had slowed down&mdash; British Empire units had encountered problems with all but seven tanks. On [[August 15]], General Haig called a halt and began planning a new offensive in [[Albert, Somme|Albert]]. This [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second Battle of the Somme]] began on [[August 21]]. Some 130,000 United States troops were involved, along with soldiers from [[British Third Army|Third]] and [[British Fourth Army|Fourth]] British Armies. It was an overwhelming success for the Allies. The [[German Second Army|Second German Army]] was pushed back over a 55 kilometer (34 mi) front. The town of [[Bapaume]] was captured on [[August 29]] and by [[September 2]], the Germans were on the [[Hindenburg Line]], which was the starting point of the war.

The Allied attempt to take the Hindenburg Line (the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]) began [[September 26]], as 260,000 American soldiers went "over the top". All divisions were successful in capturing their initial objectives, except the [[U.S. 79th Infantry Division]], which met stiff resistance at [[Montfaucon]] and took an extra day to capture the objective.

By the start of October, it was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defense, let alone a counterattack. Numerically on the frontline they were increasingly outnumbered, with the few new recruits too young or too old to be of much help. Rations were cut for men and horses because the food supply was critical. Ludendorff had decided, by [[October 1]], that Germany had two ways out of the War&mdash;total annihilation or an armistice. He recommended the latter to senior German officials at a summit on that very same day. During October, Pershing's artillery continued to unrelentingly pound the exhausted and bewildered Germans, all along the Meuse-Argonne front. The Allied pressure did not let up until the end of the war.

Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat had spread throughout the German Armed forces. The threat of general mutiny was rife. Naval commander Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and Ludendorff decided to launch a last ditch attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy. Knowing any such action would be vetoed by the government of [[Prince Maximilian of Baden|Max von Baden]], Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at [[Kiel]]. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be nothing more than a suicide bid. It was Ludendorff who took the blame for this&mdash;the Kaiser dismissed him on [[October 26]].

With power coming into the hands of new men in Berlin, further fighting became impossible. With 6 million German casualties, Germany moved toward peace. [[Prince Maximilian of Baden|Prince Max von Baden]] took charge of the new German government. Negotiations for peace began immediately upon his appointment. In the matter of the German monarchy, he was torn between the idea of a [[constitutional monarchy]]&mdash;in which he himself was in line for the crown&mdash;or a republic. President Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser and there was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic|social democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on [[November 9]] declared Germany to be a republic. Von Baden then announced that the Kaiser was to abdicate, along with all other princes in the [[Reich]]. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the [[Weimar Republic]].

==End of war==
[[Image:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|Front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' on Armistice Day, [[November 11]] [[1918]].]]

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice ([[September 29]] [[1918]]). Faced with the opening of a second front in the Austrian rear, Ludendorff and Hindenberg demanded that the government pursue a negotiated peace. On [[October 3]], Germany and Austria-Hungary appealed to President Wilson for an immediate armistice. The sailors of Germany's [[High Seas Fleet]] mutinied starting [[October 29]], and rebellion quickly spread throughout western Germany. On [[October 30]], the Ottoman Empire capitulated. On [[November 4]], the [[Armistice with Austria]] was granted to take effect at three o'clock on the afternoon. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution]], a republic was proclaimed on [[November 9]], marking the end of the monarchy. The Kaiser fled the next day to the neutral Netherlands, which granted him political asylum (see [[Weimar Republic]] for details).

On [[November 11]], [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|an armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]] in France where Germans had previously dictated terms to France, ending the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871.

At 11:00 on [[November 11]] [[1918]], a ceasefire came into effect and the opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions. Canadian [[George Lawrence Price]] is traditionally regarded as the last soldier killed in the Great War: he was shot by a German sniper and died at 10:58.

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months until it was finally ended by the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on [[June 28]], [[1919]] with Germany, and the following treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and The Ottoman Empire signed at [[Treaty of St. Germain|St. Germain]], [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Neuilly|Neuilly]] and [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres|S<U+00E8>vres]] respectively. However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the [[Turkish Independence War]]) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]], at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]] on [[July 24]] [[1923]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles treaty was signed in 1919; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of [[November 11]] [[1918]]. Legally the last formal peace treaties were not signed until 1923.

{{further|[[World War I casualties]]}}

==Economics and manpower issues==
[[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40 percent. In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war's end, there was no meat.

All nations had increases in the government's share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. To pay for purchases in the US, Britain cashed in its massive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on Wall Street. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but with war imminent with Germany, he allowed a massive increase in U.S. government lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid.

One of the most dramatic effects was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the [[Dominions]] of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all of which were designed to bolster the war effort; many of which have lasted to this day.

At the same time, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratized governments such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany. Here, however, the long term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.

Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers, at least in many of the Entente powers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost laborers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].

As the war slowly turned into a war of attrition, [[conscription]] was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in [[Canada]] and opened a political gap between the French-Canadians&mdash;who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire&mdash;and the English-speaking majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada, and a way of demonstrating leadership and high-contribution to the British Empire. Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Borden]] pushed through a [[Military Service Act]] that caused the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918 and was limited to meat, sugar and fats (butter and oleo), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917-18 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, liquor control, pay disputes, "dilution", fatigue from overtime and from Sunday work, and inadequate housing. Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man, six million out of ten million eligible in Britain. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. [Havighurst p 134-5]

==Technology==
[[Image:Nieuport.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Nieuport Fighter, France 1917.]]
{{seealso|Technology during World War I}}

The First World War was a clash of 20th century [[technology]] with 19th century [[tactics]]. Millions of soldiers, both [[volunteer]]s and [[conscript]]s fought on all sides, with [[Kitchener's Army]] being a notable all volunteer force.

Much of the war's combat involved [[trench warfare]], where hundreds often died for each meter of land gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include [[Battle of Ypres|Ypres]], [[Vimy Ridge]], [[Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai|Cambrai]], [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]]. Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties during the First World War. The war consumed vast quantities of explosives. During the war, the [[Haber process]] of nitrogen fixation was employed to provide the German forces with a continuing supply of powder for the ongoing conflict in the face of British naval control over the trade routes for naturally occurring nitrates.

There was [[chemical warfare]] and aerial bombardment, both of which had been outlawed under the 1907 [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]].

Chemical warfare was [[Use of poison gas in World War I|a major distinguishing factor of the war]]. Gases used ranged from [[tear gas]] to disabling chemicals such as [[mustard gas]] and killing [[biological agent|agents]] like [[phosgene]]. Only a small proportion of total war casualties were caused by gas, but it achieved harassment and psychological effects. Effective countermeasures to gas were found in [[gas mask]]s and hence in the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, in many cases its effectiveness was diminished.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were [[World War I Aviation|first used militarily during the First World War]]. Initial uses consisted primarily of [[reconnaissance]], though this developed into [[Close air support|ground-attack]] and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] duties as well. [[Strategic bombing]] aircraft were created principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s to this end as well.

[[U-boat]]s ([[submarines]]) were used in combat shortly after the war began. Alternating between restricted and [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] during the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]], they were employed by the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] in a strategy of defeating the British Empire through a tonnage war. The deaths of British merchantmen and the invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of several countermeasures: [[depth charges]] (1916), [[hydrophones]] (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[hunter-killer]] submarines (HMS ''R-1'', 1917), [[ahead-throwing weapons]], and dipping hydrophones (both abandoned in 1918). To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.

Tanks were introduced in World War I by the British and created [[mechanized warfare]] that dominated the rest of the 20th century. The [[Mark I (tank)|first tank]] was nicknamed ''Mother''. The first use of tanks was during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on [[September 15]] [[1916]]. This was not as successful as intended, but as a start the tanks proved their value against the machine gun. Trenches, the [[machine gun]], air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with [[shrapnel shell|fragmentation shell]]s helped stalemate the battle lines of World War I by making massed infantry attacks deadly for the attacker. The infantry was armed mostly with a [[bolt action]] magazine rifle, but the machine gun, with the ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, blunted infantry attacks as an offensive weapon; therefore, the British sought a solution and created the tank. Their first use proved tanks needed infantry support and massed formations, but within a year the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917 by breaking the Hindenburg Line while capturing 8000 enemy and 100 artillery guns.

Captive balloons were used as stationary reconnaissance points on the front lines. Balloons commonly had a crew of two with parachutes: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon the balloon crew would parachute. Recognised for their value as observer platforms, they were important targets of enemy aircraft; fixed, they were also heavily defended by antiaircraft guns. Blimps and balloons helped contribute to the stalemate of the trench warfare of World War I, and the balloons contributed to air to air combat among the aircraft to defend the skies for air superiority because of their significant reconnaissance value. The Germans conducted air raids during 1915 and 1916 on England and London with airships with the intent to damage the morale and will to fight of the British and to cause aircraft to be reassigned to England away from the front lines.

The First World War ended with Europe scarred by trenches, spent of its resources and littered with the bodies of the millions who died in battle. The direct consequences of World War I brought many old regimes crashing to the ground, and ultimately, would lead to the end of 300 years of European hegemony in the world.

No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically&mdash;four empires were shattered: the [[German Empire|German]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]]. Their four dynasties, the [[Hohenzollern]]s, the [[Habsburg]]s, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s, and the [[Romanov]]s, who had roots of power back to the days of the [[Crusade]]s, all fell during or after the war.

In [[Australian]] and [[New Zealand]] popular legend, the First World War is known as the nation's "baptism of fire", as it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it is one of the first cases where Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]]. [[Anzac Day]] (Australia New Zealand Army Corps) is thus held in great reverence by many Australians and New Zealanders.

Similarly, Anglo-Canadians believe that they proved they were their own country and not just subjects of the British Empire. Indeed, many Canadians refer to their country as a nation "forged from fire," as [[Canadians]] were respected internationally as an independent nation from the conflagrations of war and bravery. Like their [[British]] counterparts, Canadians commemorate the war dead on [[Remembrance Day]].

===Social trauma===
The experiences of the war led to a sort of collective national trauma afterwards for all the participating countries. The optimism of the 1900s was entirely gone and those who fought in the war became what is known as "the [[Lost Generation]]" because they never fully recovered from their experiences. For the next few years, much of Europe began its mourning; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.

This social trauma manifested itself in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what it had supposedly caused and began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world, supporting organizations such as the [[League of Nations]]. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and [[militarism|military might]] could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. "[[anti-modernism|"Anti-modernist]]" views were a reaction against the many changes taking place within society. The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] included a revival of the nationalistic spirit of the pre-war years and, on principle, a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[Dolchstosslegende]] was a testement to the psychological state of the defeated, as acceptance of the scapegoating mythos signified a rejection of the "lessons" of the war and therefore, a rejection of its popular resulting perspective. Certainly a sense of [[disillusionment]] and [[cynicism]] became pronounced, with [[Nihilism]] growing in popularity. This disillusionment towards humanity found a cultural climax with the [[Dada]]ist artistic movement. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, especially within Europe.

==Other names==
World War I has also been called "The Great War" (a title previously used to refer to the [[Napoleonic Wars]]) or sometimes "the [[war to end all wars]]" until [[World War II]]. The term "First World War", implying an event distinct from a "Second World War" has fallen into disfavour by some scholars who regard World War I as merely the first phase of a three-decade long war spanning the period 1914&ndash;1945.{{fn|4}}

==Quotations==
[[Image:GottStrafeEngland(1917).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Prayer saying "Gott strafe England" (May God punish England) on a wall in France. [[Autochrome]] color picture made in 1917.]]
''"The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime."'' - [[Sir Edward Grey]], British Foreign Secretary, at the beginning of the war.

''"Yesterday I visited the battlefield of last year. The place was scarcely recognisable. Instead of a wilderness of ground torn up by shell, the ground was a garden of wild flowers and tall grasses. Most remarkable of all was the appearance of many thousands of white butterflies which fluttered around. It was as if the souls of the dead soldiers had come to haunt the spot where so many fell. It was eerie to see them. And the silence! It was so still that I could almost hear the beat of the butterflies' wings".'' - a British officer, 1919.

''"The First World War killed fewer victims than the Second World War, destroyed fewer buildings, and uprooted millions instead of tens of millions - but in many ways it left even deeper scars both on the mind and on the map of Europe. The old world never recovered from the shock".'' - Edmond Taylor, in ''"The Fossil Monarchies"''

''"Soldiers! Heroes! The supreme command has erased our regiment from its records. Our regiment has been sacrificed for the honor of Belgrade and the Fatherland. Therefore, you no longer have to worry for your lives - they do not exist anymore. So, forward to glory! For King and Homeland! Long live the king! Long live Belgrade!"'' <U+2014> Major [[Dragutin Gavrilovic]], to defenders of [[Belgrade]] in [[First World War]]

[[Image:JohnMcCraeportrait.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Picture of [[John McCrae]] who wrote the famous poem [[In Flanders Fields]]. McCrae died in 1918 from [[pneumonia]] and [[meningitis]] while serving in a hospital from France.]] 

''In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>
''Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
''That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
''The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
''Scarce heard amid the guns below.''<br>
- [[Canadian]] [[lieutenant colonel]] [[John McCrae]], from the poem ''"[[In Flanders Fields]]"''

''What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?<br>
''Only the monstrous anger of the guns.''<br>
- [[Wilfred Owen]], from ''[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]''

''"[[Gott strafe England]]"'' was a common slogan of the German Army, which means ''"May God punish England"''.

''"In war-time the word patriotism means suppression of truth".'' - [[Siegfried Sassoon]] in 'Memoirs of an Infantry Officer'.

''"In war there are three courses of action open to the enemy, and he usually chooses the fourth".'' - General Helmuth von Moltke'.

''"We will support Britain to the last man and the last shilling".'' - [[Andrew Fisher]], Australian Prime Minister at the outbreak of the war.
