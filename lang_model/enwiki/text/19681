'''Global dimming''' is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it is of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960<U+2013>1990. This trend may have reversed during the past decade. Global dimming creates a cooling effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

==Cause and effects==
{{See|Albedo|Irradiance|Insolation}}
{|
| It is currently thought that the effect of global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of [[Particulate|aerosol]] particles in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] caused by human action. Aerosol particles  and other particulate pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become [[Cloud condensation nuclei|nuclei]] for cloud droplets. It is thought that the water droplets in [[cloud]]s [[Coalescence|coalesce]] around the particles. Increased pollution, resulting in more particulates, creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets, which in turn makes them more [[albedo|reflective]], therefore bouncing more sunlight back into space.

Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss. Also it has been thought that humans help produce the particles in the earth's atmosphere, in the result of global dimming.

In the mid-[[1980's]] [[Atsumu Ohmura]], a geography researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, found something that left him in a shock.  He found that solar radiation striking the Earth's surface had declined by more than 10% over the three previous decades.  His findings are in apparent contradiction to [[global warming]] - the global temperature has steadily been going up.  Less light reaching the earth would mean that it would have to cool.  Atsumu Ohmura published his findings "Secular variation of global radiation in Europe" in 1989.<ref name="Ohmura and Lang 1989">

The rate of dimming varies around the world but is on average estimated at around 2<U+2013>3% per decade, with the possibility that the trend reversed in the early 1990s. It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately [[Calibration|calibrating]] the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.

Note that the effect (2<U+2013>3%, as above) is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.<ref name="Eddy et al 1982">

Note that these numbers are for the terrestrial surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has been a bit of an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but aren't strictly confined to the land area - and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation.

The largest reductions are found in the [[northern hemisphere]] mid-latitudes.<ref>

The incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (such as [[diesel]]) and wood releases [[black carbon]] into the air.  Though black carbon, most of which is [[soot]], is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562 feet).  Also, it dims the surface of the ocean by absorbing solar radiation.<ref>{{cite news

Experiments in the [[Maldives]] (comparing the atmosphere over the northern and southern islands) in the 1990s showed that the effect of macroscopic pollutants in the atmosphere at that time (blown south from [[India]]) caused about a 10% reduction in sunlight reaching the surface in the area under the [[pollution]] cloud - a much greater reduction than expected from the presence of the particles themselves<ref>

Prior to the research being undertaken, predictions were of a 0.5<U+2013>1% effect from [[particulate]] matter; the variation from prediction may be explained by cloud formation with the particles acting as the focus for droplet creation.  
Clouds are very effective at [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] light back out into space.

The phenomenon underlying global dimming may also have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled. This may explain the cooling of the eastern United States relative to the warming western part.<ref>

Some climate scientists have theorized that aircraft [[contrail]]s (also called ''vapor trails'') are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant that this could not be tested. The near-total shutdown of [[Civil aviation|civil air traffic]] during the three days following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] afforded a rare opportunity in which to observe the climate of the [[United States]] absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in [[diurnal]] temperature variation of over 1 <U+00B0>C was observed in some parts of the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.<ref name=contrails />

Airborne [[volcanic ash]] can reflect the Sun's rays back out into space and cool the planet.  Dips in earth temperatures have been observed from large volcano eruptions such as Mount Agung in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico) 1983, Ruiz (Colombia) 1985, and Pinatubo (Philippines) 1991.  But even for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.<ref name=NASA>

It is likely that at least some of this change, particularly over Europe, is due to decreases in pollution. Most governments of [[developed nation]]s have done more to reduce aerosols released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce global dimming, more than to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

Sulfate aerosols have declined significantly since 1970 with the [[Clean Air Act]] in the United States and similar policies in Europe.  The Clean Air Act was strengthened in 1977 and 1990.  According to the EPA, from 1970 to 2005, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants, including PM<U+2019>s, dropped by 53 percent in the US. In 1975, the masked effects of trapped greenhouse gases finally started to emerge and have dominated ever since.<ref>

The [[Baseline Surface Radiation Network]] (BSRN) has been collecting surface measurements. BSRN was started in the early 1990s and updated the archives in this time. Analysis of recent data reveals that the surface of the planet has brightened by about 4% in the past decade. The brightening trend is corroborated by other data, including satellite analyses.

==Relationship to hydrological cycle==

[[Image:Climate Change Attribution.png|thumb|right|230px|This figure shows the level of agreement between a [[climate model]] driven by five factors and the [[historical temperature record]].  The negative component identified as "sulfate" is associated with the aerosol emissions blamed for global dimming.]]
Pollution produced by humans may be seriously weakening the Earth's [[water cycle]] - reducing rainfall and threatening fresh water supplies.  A 2001 study by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography suggests that tiny particles of soot and other pollutants have a significant effect on the hydrological cycle. "The energy for the hydrological cycle comes from sunlight. As sunlight heats the ocean, water escapes into the atmosphere and falls out as rain.  So as aerosols cut down sunlight by large amounts, they may be spinning down the hydrological cycle of the planet." according to prof. V. Ramanathan.<ref>

Large scale changes in weather patterns may also have been caused by global dimming. [[Climate model]]s speculatively suggest that this reduction in sunshine at the surface may have led to the failure of the [[monsoon]] in sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]] during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated [[famine]]s such as the [[Sahel drought]], caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the [[Atlantic]].<ref name="Rotstayn and Lohmann 2002">

Because of this, the [[Tropical rain belt]] may not have risen to its northern latitudes, thus causing an absence of seasonal rains. This claim is not universally accepted and is very difficult to test.

It is also concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.<ref>

A natural form of large scale environmental shading/dimming has been identified that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere [[hurricane season]]. The [[NASA]] study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the [[Sahara]] desert sent dust drifting over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and through several effects caused cooling of the waters - and thus deadening the development of hurricanes.<ref>

==Relationship to global warming==
{{See|Global warming}}

Some scientists now consider that the effects of global dimming have masked the effect of [[global warming]] to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise.<ref name=gbd2 /> According to Beate Liebert, "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter."<ref>

But it's much more complicated than an either warming or dimming issue. Global warming and global dimming are not mutually exclusive or contradictory.  In a paper published March 8 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time.<ref>

Water vapor is one of the greenhouse gases.  On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain.  Rain has the effect of clearing out polluted skies.

Climatologists are stressing that the roots of both global dimming causing pollutants and global warming causing greenhouse gases have to be dealt with together and soon.<ref>

==Global dimming as mitigation of global warming==
{{See|Mitigation of global warming|Albedo}}

Some scientists have suggested using aerosols to stave off the effects of global warming as an emergency measure.  Russian expert Mikhail Budyko understood this relationship very early on. In 1974, he suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze.<ref>
