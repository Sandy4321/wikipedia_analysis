'''The Jackson 5''' (also spelled '''''The Jackson Five''''', '''''The Jackson 5ive''''', or '''''The Jack5on Five'''''), later known as '''The Jacksons''', are an [[American popular music]] [[Jackson family|family]] [[Musical ensemble|group]] from [[Gary, Indiana]]. Founding group members [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] formed the group after performing in an early incarnation called '''The Jackson Brothers''', which originally consisted of a trio of the three older brothers. Active from 1964 to 1989, the Jacksons played from a repertoire of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], [[pop music|pop]] and later [[disco]]. During their six and a half-year [[Motown Records|Motown]] tenure, The Jackson 5 were one of the biggest pop-music phenomena of the 1970s<ref name="amg 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:88q7g4jttv3z~T00 |title=The Jackson 5|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=Macrovision Corp.|accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>, and the band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, the latter brother later transforming his early Motown solo fame into greater success as an adult artist.

The Jackson 5 were the first act in recording history to have their first four major label singles ("[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", and "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]") reach the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite speech |title=Eulogy for Michael Jackson |author=[[Berry Gordy|Gordy, Berry]] |date=July 19th 2009 |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate =2010-03-06}}</ref> Several later singles, among them "[[Mama's Pearl]]", "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]" and "[[Dancing Machine]]", were Top 5 pop hits and number-one hits on the [[R&B singles chart]]. Most of the early hits were written and produced by a specialized songwriting team known as "[[The Corporation (Motown)|The Corporation]]"; later Jackson 5 hits were crafted chiefly by [[Hal Davis]], while early Jacksons hits were compiled by the team of [[Gamble and Huff]] before The Jacksons began writing and producing themselves in the late 1970s.

Significantly, they were the first black teen idols to appeal equally to white audiences thanks partially to the successful promotional relations skills of Motown Records CEO [[Berry Gordy]]. With their departure from Motown to CBS in 1976, The Jacksons were forced to change their name and Jermaine was replaced with younger brother [[Randy Jackson (musician)|Randy]] as Jermaine chose to stay at Motown. After two years under the [[Philadelphia International Records]] label, they signed with Epic Records and asserted control of their songwriting, production, and image, and their success continued into the 1980s with hits such as "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[Lovely One]]", and "[[State of Shock]]". Their 1989 album ''[[2300 Jackson Street]]'' was recorded without Michael and Marlon. Michael and Marlon did appear, however, on the title track. The disappointing sales of the album led to the group being dropped by their record label at the end of the year. The group has never formally broken up, but has been dormant since then, although all five brothers performed together at two Michael Jackson tribute concerts in September 2001.

==Career==
===Early years===
[[File:2300 Jackson Street.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The Jackson's childhood home in [[Gary, Indiana]]]]
Born and raised in [[Gary, Indiana]], the Jackson brothers were guided early in their careers by their father [[Joseph Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]], a steel mill crane operator and former musician, and their mother [[Katherine Jackson]], who watched over the boys during the early years. Tito recalled playing around with his father's [[guitar]] while he was away working on Gary's [[steel mills]]. One night, Joe discovered Tito playing his guitar after he broke a string. Initially upset with his sons playing behind his back, he saw their potential and in 1964, Jackie, Tito and Jermaine formed ''The Jackson Brothers'', including hometown friends Reynaud Jones and Milford Hite on guitar and drums respectively. By the end of the following year, the group's younger brothers Marlon and Michael joined the instrumental band playing [[tambourine]] and [[congas]]. 

Showing extraordinary talent at a tender age, young Michael began demonstrating his dance moves and singing ability around mid-1966. Before his eighth birthday, Michael was allowed to perform his song-and-dance routine at a talent contest held at Jackie's [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Gary)|Roosevelt High School]] in Gary, helping his brothers win the competition. It was at that point that Tito's junior high school orchestra teacher Shirley Cartman began mentoring the group. She suggested replacing Jones and Hite with talented musicians [[Johnny Jackson]] (no relation) on drums and [[Ronnie Rancifer]] on keyboards. Tito moved up to [[lead guitar]] while Jermaine played [[bass guitar]] after several years as a [[rhythm guitar]]ist. 

Evelyn Lahaie, a local talent agent suggested to Joe to rename the group the Jackson 5 when they performed in her Tiny Tots Jamboree in Gary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nwitimes.com/news/local/article_45156a17-2330-5f3f-89d6-d10716a1c03f.html |title=Valpo resident who named Jackson Five recalls time with Michael |publisher=nwitimes.com |accessdate=2009-12-13 }}</ref> After the contest win, the group began playing professional gigs in [[Indiana]], [[Chicago]] and across the U.S. Many of these performances were in a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the "[[chitlin' circuit]]". The group also found themselves performing at strip joints to earn money. Cartman got the Jackson 5 a record deal with Gordon Keith's local [[Steeltown Records|Steeltown]] label, and the group began making their first recordings in October 1967. Their first single, "[[Big Boy (The Jackson 5 song)|Big Boy]]", was released in January 1968 and became a regional hit. This was followed by a second single, "We Don't Have to Be Over 21 (To Fall in Love)".<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 36<U+2013>37</ref> A third, "Let Me Carry Your School Books", features Michael Jackson singing with backing provided by The Ripples and Waves.<ref>http://www.classicurbanharmony.net/Early%20Jackson%20Five%20Records.htm</ref>

The Jackson 5 had a number of admirers in their early days, including [[Sam & Dave]], who helped the group secure a spot in the famous Amateur Night competition at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]]. The group won the August 13, 1967, competition during the Amateur Night showdown at the Apollo, impressing [[Motown|Motown Records]] artist [[Gladys Knight]]. Knight recommended the group to Motown chief [[Berry Gordy]], but Gordy, who already had teenager [[Stevie Wonder]] on his roster, was hesitant to take on another child act because of the child labor laws and other problems involved. The Jackson 5's sound was influenced by many of the biggest stars of the 1960s, including the self-contained funk bands [[Sly & the Family Stone]] and [[The Isley Brothers]], Motown group [[The Temptations]], soul legend [[Marvin Gaye]], [[rock 'n' roll]] kid group [[The Teenagers]] and soul shouters like [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Joe Tex]] and [[James Brown]].<ref name="classicmotown">[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0311/30/lkl.00.html Transcript] of interview with Jermaine Jackson. ''[[Larry King Live]]''. November 30, 2003. Retrieved from http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0311/30/lkl.00.html on August 20, 2005.</ref> At the time of their early success, R&B stars, especially coming from Motown Records, were among the most popular musicians; Motown had launched the careers of dozens of the decade's biggest stars, most notably [[The Supremes]], [[The Miracles]], Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops and the Temptations.

===Joining Motown===
By 1968, the Jackson 5 were a headlining act for the All Star Floor Show at Chicago's The Guys' and Gals' Cocktail Lounge and Restaurant. From August 12<U+2013>27, 1968, the Jackson 5 opened for [[Motown]] acts [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]] and [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]] at Chicago's [[Regal Theater, South Side (Chicago)|Regal Theater]]. The brothers caught Knight's attention, whereby she tried to get Motown brass to come to Chicago to see the boys. Taylor was also very impressed with the boys, and he decided to make the commitment to bring them to Detroit and Motown. Joseph and The Jackson Five stayed on the floor of Bobby Taylor's Detroit apartment the night of July 22, while Taylor and Motown executive [[Suzanne de Passe]] arranged for the Jackson 5 to audition for the label.

On July 23, the Jackson 5 had their Motown audition, for which they performed James Brown<U+2019>s then current hit "[[I Got the Feelin']]". Berry Gordy was not in attendance, but the audition was [[videotape]]d and sent to him in [[Los Angeles]]. Gordy's initial reluctance to sign the group disappeared when he finally saw the boys perform. Gordy decided to sign the Jackson 5 to Motown, and hosted a party at his Detroit mansion on November 25, 1968 to introduce them to the Motown staff and stars. Motown began negotiations to buy out the Jackson 5's Steeltown contract, completing the deal in March 1969. By the summer, Bobby Taylor began producing the group's first recordings at Motown's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] recording studio in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. The early Taylor-produced Jackson 5 records were all [[cover version|covers]] of both contemporary hits and Motown-standards, including Sly & the Family Stone's "[[Stand! (song)|Stand!]]" and their famous rendition of [[The Miracles]]' "[[Who's Lovin' You]]", written by [[Smokey Robinson]]. Gordy moved the Jackson 5 and Joseph to California, and he and Suzanne de Passe began the process of grooming them as the label's next big act, while the rest of the family remained in Gary. While looking for a house in California, Joseph, Jermaine, Tito, and Jackie lived with Berry Gordy, Marlon and Michael lived with Diana Ross in her California home.

Motown's marketing team prepared press kits and other promotional material to begin The Jackson 5's entrance into the mainstream music industry. Motown publicity significantly altered the group's history, publicizing the ages of most of its band mates as younger than they were <U+2014> Michael's age changed from eleven to eight to make him appear cuter <U+2014> and identifying unrelated band musicians Johnny Jackson and Ronnie Rancifer as cousins of the Jacksons. In a major marketing coup, Gordy and Motown decided to attach the group to an established star to increase public curiosity. Thus, it was decided that Motown star [[Diana Ross]] would "discover" the group as was explained in all early press kits.<ref name="cousins">(August 25, 1970). "The Jackson Five". ''Look Magazine''. Like all Motown-era Jackson 5 articles, [[Diana Ross]] is credited with having discovered the act with the help of Gary, Indiana's mayor [[Richard G. Hatcher]], and [[Johnny Jackson]] and [[Ronnie Rancifer]] are identified as cousins of the Jackson brothers.</ref> According to their official Motown biography, referenced in several early interviews and liner notes, Diana Ross (and, in some versions of the story, Berry Gordy alongside her) was introduced to the Jackson 5 by Gary, Indiana's mayor, [[Richard G. Hatcher]], at a [[benefit concert]] that the Jackson 5 were described as having played for the mayor in 1969. Impressed, Ross (and Gordy) had the act signed.

}}

The Jackson 5 practiced and rehearsed continuously during the late summer and early fall of 1969. Diana Ross formally introduced The Jackson 5 to the public on August 11, 1969, at a [[Beverly Hills, California]] club called "The Daisy." Towards the end of August, The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance, singing The Isley Brothers' "[[It's Your Thing]]" at the [[Miss Black America]] Pageant in [[Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City]].

The Jackson 5's first single, "[[I Want You Back]]", was written and produced by four Motown songwriters and producers <U+2014> Berry Gordy, [[Alphonzo Mizell]], [[Deke Richards]], and [[Freddie Perren]] <U+2014> who were collectively billed as "[[The Corporation (Motown)|The Corporation]]". "I Want You Back" was released as a single for ''The Jackson 5'', as Motown decided to officially bill the group, on October 7. The group performed "I Want You Back", Sly & the Family Stone's "[[Sing a Simple Song]]", [[The Delfonics]]' "Can You Remember", and [[James Brown]]'s "There Was a Time" as part of their appearance on ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' as special guests of Diana Ross & the Supremes. "I Want You Back" was the only single from The Jackson 5's first album, ''[[Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5]]'', which was released in December 1969. The song reached number one in January, 1970.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22">George, p. 22</ref> When it did, Michael became the first person born during the "Hot 100" era, established by [[Billboard Magazine]], to reach the number one position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 pop singles chart.

===Popularization and franchise expansion===
Most of the early Jackson 5 singles were written and produced by The Corporation, who crafted for The Jackson 5 a sound that mixed the traditional "[[Motown Sound]]" with teenage-honed lyrics that they termed "bubblegum soul". The Jackson 5 became an instant sensation, with "I Want You Back" and its 1970 follow-ups "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]," and "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" all going to number one on both the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]] chart and the ''Billboard'' Soul Singles (R&B) chart.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> "The Love You Save" charted atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for two weeks and "I'll Be There" remained at the top position of the chart for four weeks, which is tied with "I Want You Back" for the most successful single for the band in the United States.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> The three singles were commercially successful internationally, mainly peaking within the top ten on music charts.<ref name="itantyoubackinter.>{{cite web |url=http://www.lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Jackson+5&titel=I+Want+You+Back&cat=s |title=The Jackson 5 - I Want You Back (chanson) |work=LesCharts.com |publisher=Hung Medien |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref><ref name="''illbthereinter.>{{cite web |url=http://www.lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Jackson+Five&titel=I%27ll+Be+There&cat=s |title=The Jackson 5 - I'll Be There (chanson) |work=LesCharts.com |publisher=Hung Medien |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> Other early Top 5 hits included "[[Mama's Pearl]]" and "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]." Now successful, Joseph was finally able to arrange to move Katherine and the rest of the family out to California in 1970. First moving into a two-story residence at 1616 Queens Road in Los Angeles, the Jackson family moved to a gated mansion they called "Hayvenhurst", which was purchased by Joseph in March 1971. 

"Jacksonmania" swept the nation, and within a year of their debut The Jackson 5 were among the biggest names in popular music. The group essentially replaced The Supremes as Motown's main marketing focus, and, capitalizing upon the youth-oriented appeal of the Jackson brothers, Motown licensed dozens of Jackson 5-related juvenile products, including the now famous J5 Heart logo which appears on Johnny Jacksons drum kit and many of The Jackson 5's album covers, [[Label|stickers]], sewable patches, posters, and [[coloring book]]s. A new teen [[magazine]] aimed at African-American youth, ''[[Right On!]]'', began publication in 1971, and focused heavily on The Jackson 5; at least one Jackson adorned the cover of every issue published between January 1972 and April 1974. [[Animation]] producers [[Rankin/Bass]] produced ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'', a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] that debuted on September 11, 1971 and ran for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The Jackson 5 starred in two of their own [[television special]]s, ''[[Goin' Back to Indiana]]'' (aired September 16, 1971) and ''The Jackson 5 Show'' (aired November 5, 1972).

[[Image:Jackson-5-cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from [[Rankin-Bass]]'s ''[[The Jackson 5ive (cartoon)|The Jackson 5ive]]'' [[Saturday morning cartoon]].]]

In 1971, Motown began a spin-off solo career for Michael, whose first single, "Got to Be There," was a Top 5 hit. Michael also sang the title track for the 1972 [[Ben (film)|motion picture]] ''[[Ben (song)|Ben]]''. His other successful solo singles included "Rockin' Robin" and "I Wanna Be Where You Are" (both 1972). Jermaine started a solo career of his own in 1972, and had a Top Ten hit with his [[Shep and the Limelites]] cover "Daddy's Home". Jackie also recorded a solo album, but his releases failed to chart. Despite fan rumors that all three Jacksons might leave the group as they released solo work, the solo careers of Michael, Jermaine, and Jackie co-existed alongside that of the group as a whole, allowing Motown to expand the success and sales of Jackson 5-related releases.

===Decline===
After the year 1972, The Jackson 5's releases were not as successful, but they still did very well. Later top-20 hits, mostly written and produced by ''[[Hal Davis]]'' included "Lookin' Through the Windows" (1972) and the disco-styled "[[Dancing Machine]]" (1974), which popularized the "[[Robot (dance)|Robot]]" dance routine. Jackson 5 albums declined somewhat in critical acclaim and financial success during the latter part of their Motown tenure, although LPs such as ''[[Lookin' Through the Windows]]'' (1972) and ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]'' (1973) frequently included successful album tracks, including their version of "[[Hum Along and Dance]]", a popular number in their live act.

Critics, The Jackson 5, and Joseph Jackson agreed that the main reason
for the group's declining success was Motown's refusal to update their
image. Although they played their own instruments on stage and had
begun writing and producing songs in their own home recording studio,
The Jacksons later said that Motown wouldn't allow them to record their own compositions nor play instruments in their studio recordings. The group's studio recordings were first handled by Motown's famed in-house studio band [[The Funk Brothers]] during their brief recording tenure at Hitsville and later instrumentation was played by many of the members of [[The Wrecking Crew]], which formed Motown's Hitsville West studio band. Feeling that The Jackson 5 could be
more of a success without Motown, which was by this time declining in
success and popularity, Joseph began shopping for a new record deal
for his sons.

===The move to CBS Records===
[[Image:Jacksons-destiny.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The cover to the 1978 album ''[[Destiny (The Jacksons album)|Destiny]]''.]]
In 1975, Joseph negotiated a new recording contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]], who offered a royalty rate of 20% per record, compared to Motown's standard 2.8%; and would allow the Jackson brothers to write and produce their own records and play their own instruments. After unsuccessfully attempting to talk the group into staying on the label, Motown sued for breach of contract. Although Motown eventually let the group go, The Jackson 5 were forced to change their name to ''The Jacksons'', because Motown retained the "Jackson 5" [[trademark]] during the settlement of the lawsuit. The Jacksons also replaced Jermaine with their brother, fourteen year old [[Randy Jackson (musician)|Randy]], since Jermaine chose to stay with Motown and his father-in-law Berry Gordy (In 1973, Jermaine married Gordy's daughter Hazel). Randy had been an unofficial member of The Jackson 5 since 1972, playing [[conga]]s onstage as part of their live act.

After losing The Jacksons, Motown would not have another success of their caliber for the duration of Berry Gordy's ownership of the label. Gordy often said of The Jackson 5 that they were, coming after the label's most famous acts, "the last big stars to come rolling off the [Motown] assembly line."<ref name="assemblyline">(1997) "The Jackson 5". ''The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''. Retrieved from http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=125 on August 20, 1995.</ref> In summer 1976, [[CBS]] television signed the Jackson family (including Michael, Marlon, Tito, Jackie, Randy, [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[LaToya Jackson|LaToya]], and [[Janet Jackson|Janet]]) to appear in their own [[variety show]], ''[[The Jacksons (TV show)|The Jacksons]],'' to compete with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]''. ''The Jacksons'' debuted on June 16, 1976, and ran on CBS until its cancellation the following March. The show was the first variety show hosted by an [[African American]] family.

First as part of CBS's [[Philadelphia International Records]] division, and later moving over to [[Epic Records]], The Jacksons continued releasing popular singles such as "[[Enjoy Yourself (1976 song)|Enjoy Yourself]]" (1976), produced by Philadelphia International's [[Gamble and Huff|Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]]. After two LPs produced by Gamble and Huff, The Jacksons wanted artistic control, and produced their next LP, 1978's ''[[Destiny (The Jacksons album)|Destiny]]'', on their own. The album included The Jacksons' biggest post-Motown single, "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", which charted at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and at number three on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. "Shake Your Body", written by Michael and Randy, sold over two million copies, attaining double-platinum status. ''Destiny'' also went platinum, and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200 album chart and number three on the R&B album charts. In 1979, The Jacksons received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1978, Michael starred alongside Diana Ross in the Motown/[[Universal Pictures]] motion picture ''[[The Wiz]]'', an adaptation of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] based upon [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. [[Quincy Jones]] was the producer of the film's songs, and he and Michael began work on Michael<U+2019>s first Epic solo album, ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]]'', the next year. ''Off the Wall'', released in 1979, sold 20 million copies worldwide and featured four Top 10 hit singles and two number-one singles, causing some speculation about whether Michael would leave The Jacksons though Michael told several reporters at the time that such speculation was untrue.

=== Michael and Marlon's departure and other work ===
In 1980 the group released the ''[[Triumph (The Jacksons album)|Triumph]]'' album, which featured the hits "[[This Place Hotel]]" and "[[Can You Feel It]]", as well as the dance club hit "Walk Right Now". The following year's ''[[The Jacksons Live!]]'' used recordings from the group's ''Triumph Tour'', which in 1988 was described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine as one of the best 25 tours from 1967 to 1987. The group's success was outperformed, however, by Michael's 1982 LP ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''. ''Thriller'' went on to become the most successful album ever in the United States, and to date stands as the world's best-selling album of all time. The ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever|Motown 25]]'' television special, broadcast on [[NBC]] on May 16, 1983, featured a reunion performance between Jermaine and the other brothers. Outside of one 1979 appearance on the TV show ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|Midnight Special]]'' this was the original Jackson 5's first performance in nearly seven years. The ''Motown 25'' Jackson 5 reunion was overshadowed, however, by Michael's incredible performance of "[[Billie Jean]]" on the same program, which introduced his trademark "[[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]" dance. The Jacksons released the album ''[[Victory (The Jacksons album)|Victory]]'' in 1984, featuring the hit single "[[State of Shock]]" with guest star [[Mick Jagger]], and supported the album with the [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] of the United States and Canada. The ''Victory'' album and tour marked the official return of Jermaine to the group's lineup, making them a [[sextet]].

Michael's name became name recognition as a solo act had also grown, despite touring as part of a group. Marlon followed Michael out of the group a year later during a group meeting. The other brothers eventually drifted apart to take on solo projects (although most of them appeared with Michael on the U.S. For Africa single "[[We Are the World]]" in 1985). The Jacksons reunited for one last album, ''[[2300 Jackson Street]]'' in 1989. While every Jackson sibling except for [[La Toya Jackson|LaToya]] appeared on the title track, a #9 R&B hit single, most of the album featured Jermaine, Jackie, Tito, and Randy as the line up. Michael Jackson's fame as a solo act as well as the growing fame of the group's youngest sister, [[Janet Jackson]], had overshadowed the group entirely. A CD compilation of hits from the CBS/Epic years, ''[[The Essential Jacksons]]'', was released in 2004, as was a separate compilation assembled by Universal/Hip-O, ''[[The Jacksons Story]]''.

In 1992, Suzanne de Passe and Jermaine Jackson worked with Motown to produce ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', a five-hour television [[miniseries]] broadcast based on the history of The Jacksons in a two part special on [[American Broadcast Company]]. The first installment of the miniseries covered the decades from Katherine and Joseph Jackson's first meeting in the late-1940s up until the first Jackson 5 releases on Motown in 1969, while the second part covered the years from 1970 to 1984, and the effects of The Jackson 5's phenomenal success on the family. The miniseries was the highest rated show of the week, won an [[Emmy Award]] and was nominated for three more, and won two [[Young Artist Award]]s. In 2001, The Jacksons reunited to celebrate 30 years of Michael Jackson as a solo artist.
