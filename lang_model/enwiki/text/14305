'''Gemlik'''  is a town and district in the [[Bursa Province]] in [[Turkey ]]<nowiki/>on the southern gulf of [[Armutlu Peninsula]] on the coast of the [[Sea of Marmara]]. It is located approximately {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Bursa]], not far from [[Istanbul]]. Gemlik was called [[Cius|Kios]] until 1922, when its Greek inhabitants, who composed around 80% of the population, left [[Asia Minor]] as a result of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. As of 2009, the total population of Gemlik is 100,000.

Gemlik harbor is one of the most important harbors in Turkey. The remains of the [[ancient Greek]] town of [[Kios]] can be found east of Gemlik. The city is renowned for [[Gemlik olive|olives]] and olive oils. Marmara Birlik, a cooperative of olive farmers and producers, it is ranked among the top olive producers in the world.

==Etymology==

As of 1920, the British were calling Gemlik, '''Geumlek''' in publications.<ref name=Prothero75>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/75/}}</ref>

==Climate==
Gemlik borders the Sea of Marmara. It exhibits typical Mediterranean weather with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.

==Geography==
Gemlik is bordered on three sides by mountains, with the Samanli Mountains lying to the west. To its west lies the Sea of Marmara. There is a large plain spanning much of the east end of Gemlik to the coast. Karsak Stream, which originates at <U+0130>znik Lake, divides this plain into two parts.  

The coast of Gemokk is straight, except around Kayikhane.

The gulf of Gemlik, often called Incir port or Kilyos (in reference to the ancient name of the town), is 35 km from east to west, 10<U+2013>15 km from north to south, and 100-150 meters deep. Tuzla and Kapakli lie at either end of the gulf. For many years, this gulf had been used for docking ships, but now it serves as a tourist attraction.

The largest river in the area is Karsak, near <U+0130>znik Lake.  Another river, Koca stream, is near Eng<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>c<U+00FC>k.

==History==
In 1390 BC, Gemlik was established by a general named Siyus who named the surrounding area after himself.  Gemlik has been occupied by the Egyptians, Romans, and [[Anatolia]]ns. Gemlik was controlled by the Anatolians until World War I. After the war, Greece occupied Gemlik.

As of 1920, Gemlik was estimated to have a population of 5,000. At that time, it had a [[naval yard]] that was no longer in use.<ref name=Prothero75/> Since September 11, 1922, Greece ended its occupation of Gemlik.

==Tourist attractions==
The popular [[Kur<U+015F>unlu, Bursa|Kur<U+015F>unlu beaches]] are located in Gemlik.
