'''Jones Gap State Park''' is a large park located in northern [[Greenville County, South Carolina]]. Combined with the nearby [[Caesars Head State Park]], Jones Gap forms the Mountain Bridge Wilderness Area on the [[Blue Ridge Escarpment]]. 

The {{convert|3346|acre|sqkm|0|sing=on}} state park is located along the [[Middle Saluda River]], a popular river for trout fishing.

==History==

Jones Gap was named after Solomon Jones, a road maker born in 1802.
