'''Peter Miguel Camejo''' (December 31, 1939 <U+2013> September 13, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] author, activist and politician. In the [[2004 United States presidential election]], he was selected by independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]] as his [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] running mate on a ticket which had the endorsement of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]].<ref>[http://www.votenader.org/media_press/index.php?cid=32 ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0DB113CF930A25756C0A9629C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/R/Reform%20Party|title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE INDEPENDENT; Reform Party Backs Nader, Offering Line On Ballots|location=Mississippi; Kansas; Michigan; Colorado; Montana; Florida; South Carolina|publisher=New York Times|date=2004-05-13|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> 

Camejo was a three-time [[Green Party of California|Green Party]] gubernatorial candidate most recently in [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]], when he received 2.3 percent of the vote. Camejo also ran in the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election]] finishing [[Results of the 2003 California recall|fourth in a field of 135 candidates]] (2.8%), and in [[California gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]], finishing third with 5.3%. In the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] he was running for the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]].

==Early life==
Camejo was a first-generation American of [[Venezuela]]n descent. At the time of his birth, his mother was residing in the [[Queens]] borough of [[New York City]]. Although a "natural born citizen" of the United States (constitutionally eligible for the U.S. Presidency later in life)  Camejo spent most of his early childhood in Venezuela.

His parents, Elvia (n<U+00E9>e Guanche) and Dr. Daniel Camejo Octavio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/camejo.html|title=Ancestry of Peter Camejo|publisher=Wargs.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> divorced when their son was seven. Camejo then resided with his mother in the United States and returned to Venezuela during summer holidays to visit family. In later youth Camejo showed talent as a [[yachtsman]], competing in 1960 for Venezuela at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Olympics]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Camejo entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], involving himself in [[soccer]] and, increasingly, [[left-wing]] politics. Later he studied history at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he won election to student council. His participation in a protest of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967 led to his suspension from the university for "using an unauthorized microphone." Then-governor [[Ronald Reagan]] deemed Camejo one of California's ten most dangerous citizens due to his presence at [[anti-war]] protests.<ref name="NYT">"Peter Camejo, 68, Dies; <U+2019>04 Nader Pick" AP, September 13, 2008, 9:46 p.m. ET, in the ''New York Times'' [http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Obit-Camejo.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin]</ref> He also participated in one of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma civil rights marches]].<ref name="NYT"/>

==Political evolution==
Initially, Camejo was a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] party. As a branch organizer, he sought to reorient the SWP towards the student movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/amersocialist/cochranite_legacy.htm|title=The Cochranite Legacy|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> He was the SWP's nominee for [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|President in 1976]] and won 90,986 votes, or 0.1%.

While a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (USA)|Socialist Workers Party]], Camejo wrote ''Racism, Revolution, Reaction, 1861-1877. The Rise and Fall of Radical Reconstruction''([[Pathfinder Press]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pathfinderpress.com/s.nl/it.A/id.602/.f?category=|title=Racism, Revolution, Reaction, 1861-1877|publisher=Pathfinderpress.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>

The SWP's policy was to turn its members into "proletarians" by having them take jobs in factories and advocate for a worker-based class struggle. By 1980, Camejo came to disagree with this policy in favor of [[democratic socialism]], and the SWP expelled him.

In 1992 Camejo committed $20,000 of his own money toward establishing the [[Progressive Alliance of Alameda County]], an organizational effort that failed to sustain itself. Camejo was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a watermelon<U+2014>green on the outside but red on the inside.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2002/10/02/MN31845.DTL&o=0|title=Multimedia (image)|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=2011-01-01|first=Suzanne|last=Herel}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Just over a month after the 2004 election, Camejo was elected as one of California's delegates to the National Committee of the [[United States Green Party|Green Party]] and established the GDI, "Greens for Democracy and Independence," a cadre group within the larger Green Party of  California that ran candidates for local Green County Councils, another organizational effort that failed to sustain itself. At the 2005 Green Party National Convention, Camejo stated that he would not be a candidate for President in 2008.

Camejo wrote a number of articles concerning the divisions evident in the Green Party in the aftermath of the turbulent 2004 national convention, continuing the themes of the [[Avocado Declaration]] in opposing attempts to "cozy up" to the newly-formed [[Progressive Democrats of America]].

As a candidate for California Governor, Camejo, along with other Green Party candidates and activists [[Todd Chretien]], Sarah Knopp, Rachel Odes, Don Bechler, [[Mehul Thakker]], [[Forrest Hill (CA Secretary of State candidate)|Forrest Hill]], and [[Donna Warren]], wrote ''California Under Corporate Rule'', which he self-published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votecamejo.com/|title=Votecamejo|publisher=Votecamejo|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>

In August 2008 he attended the convention of the [[Peace and Freedom Party]] in order to personally endorse Nader's presidential candidacy.<ref name="NYT"/>

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
[[Image:camejo gov.jpg|thumb|left|Camejo at UC Berkeley giving a lecture during the 2003 Gubernatorial Recall Election in California]]
Camejo ran for Governor of California three times, against incumbent governors [[Gray Davis]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in 2002 and 2006, and in the 2003 recall election in which Schwarzenegger replaced Davis as governor.

===2002 gubernatorial election===
In [[California gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]], Camejo ran uncontested in the California Green Party gubernatorial primary. In the general election, he ran as part of the first full slate of Green candidates for all seven of California's partisan constitutional offices. Camejo lost the election to Governor [[Gray Davis]], but he polled 393,036 votes, for 5.3% of the vote, the largest vote total for a [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] in the California governor's race since [[California gubernatorial election, 1946|1946]], when Henry R. Schmidt of the [[Prohibition Party]] polled 7.1%. Because the San Francisco Green Party endorsed him, Camejo earned more votes in [[San Francisco]] than [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial nominee [[Bill Simon (politician)|Bill Simon]], a rarity in third-party politics. Camejo's alienation of the San Francisco local resulted in neither an endorsement nor any effort expended towards organizing for him in subsequent elections and he was unable to beat the Republican in San Francisco in 2003 and 2004.

===2003 gubernatorial recall election===
In 2003, he was the endorsed [[Green Party of California|Green Party]] candidate for governor (although several other Greens appeared on the ballot) in an unprecedented [[California recall]] election, in which he polled [[Results of the 2003 California recall|242,247 votes for 2.8%]], coming in fourth in a field of 135 certified candidates. In a strange preview of the divisions about to erupt on the left in the following year, Camejo first cooperated with, and then competed with, fellow recall candidate [[Arianna Huffington]].

===2006 gubernatorial election===
[[Image:Peter Camejo anti-war demonstration march 2006.jpg|thumb|right|In San Francisco, Peter Camejo demonstrates for peace and against war March 3, 2006.]]	
In [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]], Camejo made his third bid for Governor of California against incumbent Arnold Schwarzenegger and Democratic Party nominee [[Phil Angelides]]. Camejo received 193,553 votes, or 2.3% of the popular vote.

==2004 vice-presidential campaign==
Camejo was submitted as a candidate in the Green Party of California's March 2, 2004, Presidential Preference Primary. Before the primary, he made it known that he was not planning to run for president and that any delegates pledged to him would not be committed to vote for him after the first round. The former gubernatorial candidate received 33,753 votes (75.9%) of the Green Party membership's support in California,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/sov/2004_primary/sov_summary_pres.pdf|title=sov_summary_pres.xls|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> and 72.7% of the votes in all Green Party primary elections.<ref name="counterpunch.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/miller08072004.html|title=Carol Miller and Forrest Hill: Rigged Convention; Divided Party|publisher=Counterpunch.org|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>

In June 2004, Camejo campaigned for the vice-presidential spot beside two-time Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader as independents, running against the Green Party nominee. They received the endorsement of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]], which gave them ballot access in several states they would not otherwise have. With votes for Nader added in, the Nader/Camejo ticket had what appeared to be an insurmountable 83% of Green voters behind their candidacies going into the Green Party National Convention.<ref name="counterpunch.org"/> However, their lack of contrition about their intentions and Nader's last-minute naming of Camejo as his running mate led to the appearance of a [[bait and switch]] deception, and did not play well with Green delegates.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Rejected by the Greens, Nader and Camejo continued their campaign as independent candidates.

Both Nader and Camejo said the main reason they ran in the 2004 election was because there were no other national candidates demanding an immediate withdrawal of American troops from what they believe is an immoral and unconstitutionally pursued [[War in Iraq]] (though Green [[David Cobb]], [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Michael Badnarik]], [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] candidate [[Michael Peroutka]], [[Socialist Party USA]] candidate [[Walt Brown]] and [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] candidate [[R<U+00F3>ger Calero]] also opposed the war to varying degrees.) However, unlike all of these candidates, because Ralph Nader was regularly invited to appear on mainstream news, the Nader and Camejo team were the only candidates who had a regular voice in the mainstream media arguing for withdrawal.

The Nader/Camejo ticket came in a distant third in the election, polling approximately 460,000 votes, or 0.4% of the vote. Camejo's supporters claimed vindication of their assertion that Nader/Camejo had four-to-one support within the party, as Cobb and running mate [[Pat LaMarche]] received scarcely a fifth of their support at 119,859 votes (0.1%) a drop of 95% compared to the Green Party's 2000 national ticket. Camejo's experiences on the 2004 campaign are chronicled in [[Jurgen Vsych]]'s book, "What Was Ralph Nader Thinking?"<ref>http://www.thewomandirector.com</ref>

==Family and work==
Camejo is survived by his wife, Morella Camejo; stepdaughter Alexandra Baquera, stepson Victor Baquera, and brothers Antonio and Daniel Camejo and Danny Ratner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Rachel|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2008/09/15-2|title=Peter Camejo Dies - Helped Found Green Party|publisher=CommonDreams.org|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> He last lived in [[Folsom, California]], where he was Chief Executive Officer of Progressive Asset Management,<ref>{{cite web|author=Created by WJDesigns|url=http://www.progressive-asset.com/index.html|title=Progressive Asset Management - Specializing in Socially Responsible Investing|publisher=Progressive-asset.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> a financial investment firm that encourages socially responsible projects.

Camejo is the author of ''The SRI Advantage: Why Socially Responsible Investing Has Outperformed Financially.''

At the time of his death, Camejo was engaged in writing ''North Star: A Memoir,'' published in May 2010 by [[Haymarket Books]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Camejo|first=Peter|url=http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/North-Star-A-Memoir|title=North Star: A Memoir|publisher=Haymarket Books|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>

==Conflict within the Green Party==
In the run-up to the June 6, 2006, primary elections in his home state, Camejo helped create Green IDEA (later known as IDEA PAC), a California [[political action committee]] espousing "Independence, Democracy, Empowerment, and Accountability," to support candidates for county councils, the locally elected leadership bodies of the Green Party of California. The IDEA PAC was not raising or spending money as of 2010. 

Arguing that outside intervention in local elections might be construed a contravention of the Green [[Ten Key Values]] of Decentralization and Grassroots Democracy, [[Peter Daniels]] criticized Camejo for "lend[ing] his support to the right-wing effort to depose [California governor Gray] [[Gray Davis|Davis]]" by recall in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/sep2003/came-s30.shtml|title=Peter Camejo and the Greens bid for "respectability" in California recall campaign|publisher=Wsws.org|date=2003-09-30|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> However, the [[Green Party of California|Green Party]] state convention easily voted to endorse Camejo as a recall replacement candidate.

==Death==
In January 2007, Camejo announced that he had been diagnosed with early-stage [[lymphoma]], a cancer that is usually treatable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/timesstar/localnews/ci_4976837|title=Camejo announces lymphoma diagnosis|publisher=Inside Bay Area|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref> As of March 2008, after a series of chemotherapy treatments, the cancer was in remission,<ref>Daniel Ratner, Brother</ref> but in May it was announced that doctors had made a second diagnosis of lymphoma; Camejo died four months later.<ref>[http://petercamejoupdates.blogspot.com/ Peter Camejo Update 1] Peter Camejo died on September 13, 2008.
