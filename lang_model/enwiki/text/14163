Nivat completed her doctorate in political science after education at [[Sciences Po|Paris Institute of Political Studies]], or Sciences Po, in Paris.<ref name=ulyssesbio>{{cite web|title=Jury: Anne Nivat, France |publisher=Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage |year=2005, 2006 |url=http://www.lettre-ulysses-award.org/jury05/bio_nivat.html}}</ref>

Anne Nivat became an expert on Russia politics. Her first book was about Russian media during the period of ''[[Glasnost|glasnost]]'' in the former [[Soviet Union]], the dissolution of country, and the aftermath until 1995 (Anne Nivat, ''Quand les m<U+00E9>dias russes ont pris la parole : de la glasnost <U+00E0> la libert<U+00E9> d'expression: 1985-1995'', published in 1997).<ref name=ulyssesbio /> After a stay at Harvard University with Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies (1997-1998),<ref name=oil>{{cite book|author=Ann Nivat |chapter=Oil is our Identity (interview) |editor=East West Institute |title=Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union: 1997 - The Challenge of Integration |publisher=M.E.

She said she was influenced by Polish journalist [[Ryszard Kapu<U+015B>ci<U+0144>ski]], whom she later met before his death, and the well-known Italian journalist [[Curzio Malaparte]], who covered the Eastern front during World War II and wrote his accounts in the books ''Kaputt'' (1944) and ''The Skin'' (1949).<ref name=pritzker />

She speaks several languages besides her native French and learned Russian and English, such as a working knowledge of Arabic.<ref name=pritzker />

==Career==
She began her reporting career at [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] and ''Transitions'' magazine in Prague, where she worked for three years between 1995 and 1997,<ref name=oil/> including a stint under [[Michael T. Kaufman|Michael Kaufman]], a ''New York Times'' foreign correspondent and editor, while he was on leave.<ref name=pritzker /><ref name=FreedomForum>{{cite web|first=Laura last=Bailey |title=Female war correspondent finds gender an asset in Chechnya |publisher=Freedom Forum |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=13754}}</ref>

As a journalist, Anne Nivat is most known for her reporting from Chechnya in 1999-2000 where she worked for ''[[Ouest France]]'' and as a special correspondent for ''[[Lib<U+00E9>ration]]''. Nivat traveled to Moscow in September 1999, and when the Russians invaded Chechnya, she applied as a journalist for access but was denied. She gained access to the war zone by traveling there disguised as a Chechen woman and reported independently from Russian control. Nivat was in Chechnya for 4 months while she intermingled and blended with the local population and reported on the conflict during a ban on journalists until she was picked up by the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] and expelled.<ref name=salon /><ref name=Boston>{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Montgomery-Fate |title=Hearts and minds: Gauging the effects of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through the personal stories of teachers, clerics and minorities |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=September 25, 2005 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/09/25/hearts_and_minds/}}</ref><ref name=Lexpress>{{cite news|first=Sylvaine |last=Pasquier |title=Deux femmes t<U+00E9>moignent du drame tch<U+00E9>tch<U+00E8>ne |newspaper=L'Express |date=August 3, 2000 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/europe/deux-femmes-temoignent-du-drame-tchetchene_493741.html#vrimxVDAVAjCHiGL.99}}</ref> She says she believes her success in Chechny was based on several facters:<blockquote>The fact that I am a woman helped me a great deal covering this war. No one pays attention to a woman. Whereas if you are a man, you might be arrested at any time. Also, Dan (Williams, Moscow correspondent for the ''Washington Post'',) doesn<U+2019>t speak Russian. The three elements which played in my favor were the fact that I speak Russian, the fact that I am a woman and the fact that I am a part of the written press <U+2014> I didn<U+2019>t need microphones. And the fourth element is luck.<ref name=salon /></blockquote> Chechnya is where she began her career as a war correspondent, and she said it was also her worst war experience as she survived Russian military bombardment.<ref name=pritzker /><ref name=Lexpress />

Since 2004, she has worked for ''[[Le Point]]'', a weekly French news magazine, and has also written for ''Le Soir'' and ''Le Nouvel Observateur'', as well as the French ''Huffington Post''.<ref name=ulyssesbio /><ref>{{cite news|first=Elaine |last=Sciolino |title=Editor Is the Story as the French Huffington Post Starts |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/business/media/anne-sinclair-takes-helm-at-french-huffington-post.html}}</ref>. Her English-language journalism has appeared in the ''USA Today'', ''US News & World Report'', ''Washington Post'', ''New York Times'', and ''[[Nieman Reports]]''.  For the ''[[New York Times]]'', she wrote a piece called "Life in the 'red zone'", which is about her experiences as a war correspondent in Iraq and is included in her French-language book about Iraq.<ref name=pritzker /><ref>{{cite news||first=Anne |last=Nivat |title=Life in the 'red zone' |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/opinion/18iht-ednivat.1.6713743.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>

In 2012, her Russian visa was annulled and she was expelled once again shortly after an interview with the Russian opposition and before the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|presidential election]]. Days later, the immigration officer was fired and the Russian ambassador apologized and invited Nivat back to Russia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Emerging Europe: French Author Says Russia Expelled Her on Political Grounds |first=Alexander |last=Kolyandr |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |type=blog |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/02/13/french-author-says-russia-expelled-her-on-political-grounds/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Emerging Europe: Russian Immigration Officer Sacked After Expelling French Author |first=Alexander |last=Kolyandr |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |type=blog |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/02/14/russian-immigration-officer-sacked-after-expelling-french-author/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Emerging Europe: Russia Invites French Journalist to Return|first=Alexander |last=Kolyandr |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |type=blog |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/02/17/russia-invites-french-journalist-to-return/}}</ref> Her account was published by the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Anne |last=Nivat |title=How I got kicked out of Russia |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=2013-06-02 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/opinion/how-i-got-kicked-out-of-russia.html?_r=0}}</ref>
