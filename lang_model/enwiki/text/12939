{{dablink|This is about route of the Caledonian Railway Main Line; for historical railway company see [[Caledonian Railway]] and for the modern preserved line see [[Caledonian Railway (Brechin)]].}}

==Description of the route==
The [[Caledonian Railway]] Main Line runs from Carlisle, via [[Annandale]], [[Beattock Summit|Beattock]] and the [[River Clyde|Clyde valley]], to Central Scotland. The original Glasgow terminus was at [[Buchanan Street]] access via the [[Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway]] (from Coatbridge) which was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway. Buchanan Street remained the Glasgow terminus until 1897, when [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] become the major Caledonian terminus for trains from the south. Access was via the [[Clydesdale Junction Railway]] from Motherwell. A junction at [[Carstairs railway station|Carstairs]] provided a connection to [[Edinburgh Princes Street railway station|Princes Street]] station in Edinburgh. 

The main line from Carlisle was opened as far as Beattock on 9 September 1847.<ref name=awdry-64>Awdry, Page 64</ref> The section from Beattock to Edinburgh opened on 15 February 1848; and the section from Beattock to Glasgow, Buchanan Street, opened on 1 November 1849 for passengers and on 1 January 1849 for goods.<ref name=awdry-64/> The final section of the journey was initially via [[Monklands (Scotland)|Monklands]], on the [[Wishaw and Coltness Railway]] and the [[Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway]], which had opened in 1831.

The main line from Carlisle to Glasgow (but now to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]]) and Edinburgh (but now to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]]) is still in use today, although quite a few of the original Caledonian railway stations have closed. It is now the northern section of the [[West Coast Main Line]]; the southern section being the former [[London and North Western Railway]].

The main line at Quintinshill, near [[Gretna Green]] was the site of the [[Quintinshill rail crash]], which occurred on 22 May 1915.<ref name=rolt-207-213>Rolt, 207 - 213 </ref> Two rival lines connected to the Caledonian Railway near this point: the [[Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway]], at Gretna, later to become the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and still in use today as the [[Glasgow South Western Line]]; and the North British Railway's [[Waverley Line]], currently closed in its entirety.

==Carstairs to Greenhill Junction==
{{Caledonian Railway (Carstairs to Greenhill Junction)}}
A complex section of line running north through Lanarkshire to East Dunbartonshire were a connection was made with the [[Scottish Central Railway]] at Greenhill Lower Junction. Although adjacent to the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] at Greenhill Junctions, no direct connection was made  which included the absorption of the [[Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway]] (between Gartsherrie North Junction and Whifflet) and the [[Wishaw and Coltness Railway]] (between Whifflet and Law Junction). Between Mossend and Motherwell, a Motherwell deviation line was constructed away from the original route of the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. To provide additional capacity, a Wishaw Deviation Line was constructed between Holytown (on the [[Cleland and Midcalder Line]]) and Law Junction.

Silvermuir Junctions (north of Carstairs) provided a triangular connection to the Lanark and [[Douglas Branch]]es.

==Carstairs to Carlisle==
{{Caledonian Railway (Carstairs to Carlisle)}}
The original stations between Carlisle and Carstairs were: [[Rockcliffe]], [[Floriston]], [[Kirkpatrick]], [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]], [[Kirtlebridge]], [[Ecclefechan]], [[Lockerbie]], [[Nethercleugh]], [[Wamphray]], [[Beattock]], [[Elvanfoot]], [[Crawford]], [[Abington, South Lanarkshire|Abington]], [[Lamington]], [[Symington]] and [[Thankerton]]. Of these, only Lockerbie is still in use, and the Lockerbie-Carstairs section is still the longest stretch of UK railway uninterrupted by a station.

*[[Carlisle and Port Carlisle Railway and Dock Company]] at [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]]
*[[Border Union Railway]] (also known as the [[Waverley Line]]) at [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]] and [[Gretna (Caledonian) railway station|Gretna]]

*[[Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway]] at [[Symington railway station|Symington]]

===Moffat Railway===
This short branch was authorised as an independent railway on 27 June 1881. It was promoted locally to link Moffat to the Caledonian Railway at [[Beattock railway station|Beattock]]. The line was opened on 2 April 1883, leased to the Caledonian Railway on 14 July 1884 and formally taken over on 31 May 1889.

The branch line was closed to passengers on 6 December 1954 and to freight on 6 April 1964.<ref name=awdry-94>Awdry, Page 94</ref>

===Current operations===
In 2007 the main line is still open, as part of the [[West Coast Main Line|WCML]] from [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] to the south. However there is now only one station now open at [[Lockerbie railway station|Lockerbie]] and all the immediate branches between Gretna Junction and Strawfrank Junction are closed.

In 2008, a feasibility study is to be undertaken to examine the possibility of opening a station at Symington to provide local services from the area into Glasgow, presumably with bus connections to the nearby town of Biggar. <ref name=SPT>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story455.html SPT news<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The railway hotel building which formed the street frontage of the Edinburgh Princes Street Station was well known as the ''Caley Hotel'', and is still in use as a hotel today.
