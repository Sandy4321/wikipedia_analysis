The '''Big Sable Point Light''' is a [[lighthouse]] on the eastern shore of [[Lake Michigan]] near [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]] in [[Mason County, Michigan|Mason County]], [[Michigan]], at the [[Ludington State Park]].<ref>[http://www.ludingtoninfo.com/statepark/index.php Ludington State Park.]</ref>  It is an active [[aid to navigation]].<ref name ="conservancy">[http://www.michiganlights.com/bigsablepointlh.htm Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy, Big Sable Point Light.]</ref>

==History==
On July 28, 1866, Congress appropriated $35,000 for a new lighthouse at Big Sable Point.  Approximately {{convert|933|acre}} was deeded from the State of Michigan to the U.S. at no cost and in early 1867 construction began,<ref>Thomas A. Tag (1997) ''Big Sable Point Light Station'', p.6. ISBN 0-9649980-3-3</ref> making it the first light station in the area.<ref>[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080520/SPECIAL01/80519001 Interactive map on Michigan lighthouses.] [[Detroit News]].</ref>

Built in 1867, the {{convert|112|ft|sing=on}} tower was originally made of yellow cream brick. It has a focal plane of {{convert|106|ft}}.  The building was made of so-called [[Cream City Brick]].<ref name="Pepper">[http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/cream_city_brick/cream_city_brick.htm Cream City Brick, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light.]</ref>  The brick deteriorated and was thereafter covered with [[Sheet steel|boiler plate]] in 1900.<ref name="official"/>

Construction materials were brought up by ships.  The first road to the site was not completed until 1933.<ref>[http://www.lighthousecentral.com/lighthouse_gallery.php4?lighthouse=Big%20Sable%20Point%20Lighthouses Lighthouse Central,  Photographs, History, Directions and Way points for Big Sable Point Light, ''The Ultimate Guide to West Michigan Lighthouses'' by Jerry Roach (Publisher: Bugs Publishing LLC - 2005).] ISBN 0-9747977-0-7.</ref>

Because the brick deteriorated from exposure to the elements, a steel plate encasement was installed in 1900 at a cost of $3,225.<ref>Thomas A. Tag (1997) ''Big Sable Point Light Station'', p.23. ISBN 0-9649980-3-3</ref>  The yellow brick now encased in steel plate was difficult to see and a [[daymark]] was needed.  Several changes to the daymark over the years were made.  Currently, the tower is painted white with a black watch tower and a black band around the middle of the tower.<ref>Hyde, Charles K., ''The Northern Lights'' (Wayne State University Press, 1987) pp. 118, 121.</ref>  As shown in a historic post card,<ref>[http://www.michiganlights.com/bigsablepointlh.htm historic post card]</ref> it was painted red and white at one time; later to become black and white.<ref>[http://www.leuchtturm-welt.net/HTML/USAPK/ORIGINAL/P_SABLE.JPG black and white]</ref><ref>[http://www.leuchtturm-welt.net/HTML/USAPK/ORIGINAL/P_SABLE.JPG Huelse, Klaus. Historic postcard images of U.S. lighthouses, Historic Post Card View <U+2014> "Point Sable Lighthouse".]</ref>

It was the last Great Lakes Lighthouse to get electricity and plumbing, which came in the late 1940s.<ref name="Harrison">[http://www.lighthousedepot.com/lite_digest.asp?action=get_article&sk=176 Harrison, Timothy. ''Big Sable, The Queen of the Lake''.] [[Lighthouse Digest]] (Jul 1997), pp. 1-3.</ref>

The original lens was a third order [[Fresnel lens]],<ref>''See'' [http://www.terrypepper.com/lights/closeups/illumination/fresnel/3order.htm Third Order Fresnel lens, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light.]</ref> inscribed "Sautter & Co., Constructeurs." It was removed in 1985, and is now on display at the [[Rose Hawley Museum]]<ref>[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/bigsable_lens.jpg Photograph, Big Sable Point Light Third Order Fresnel Lens, Rose Hawley Museum] at Lighthouse Friends.</ref> at [[White Pine Village]].<ref>[http://lighthouse.boatnerd.com/gallery/Michigan/bigsablepoint.htm Wobser, David and Edin Colt, boatnerd.com, Big Sable Point Light.]</ref>  The lighthouse follows a design first used at [[New Presque Isle Light]], which was also used on several other lights on the [[Great Lakes]].

After the light was automated, the [[lighthouse keeper|keeper's]] house was severely vandalized.<ref name="Harrison">[http://www.lighthousedepot.com/lite_digest.asp?action=get_article&sk=176 Harrison, Timothy. "Big Sable, The Queen of the Lake."] [[Lighthouse Digest]] (Jul 1997), pp. 1-3.</ref>

In 1986, the lighthouse station was leased to the Foundation for Behavioral Research. The foundation has worked with the Big Sable Lighthouse Association to preserve the buildings.

[[Lighthouse keeper]]s were: Alonzo Hyde, Sr. (1867<U+2013>1869), Alonzo W. Hyde (1869<U+2013>1871), Newton Bird (1871<U+2013>1873), Burr Caswell (1874<U+2013>1882), Hans Hansen (1882<U+2013>1887), James Rich (1887<U+2013>1888), Tomas Bailey (1889<U+2013>1893), George Blake (1899<U+2014>1903), Samuel Gagnon (1905<U+2013>1923), Joseph Kimmers (1922<U+2013>1923), Leweilyn Vanatter (1923<U+2013>1936), George Rogan (1936<U+2013>1949), David Sauers (1949<U+2013>1954), Henry Vavrina (1955<U+2013>1965), Homer Meverden (1965<U+2013>1968).<ref name="Price">{{cite uscghist|MI}}</ref>

In the middle of the 20th Century, 1949, Big Sable was electrified.  It was the last [[Great Lakes]] light to give up wicks.  This paved the way for automation and the elimination of the [[Lighthouse keeper]]'s job.<ref name="Pepper"/>

The [[fog horn]], which was steam and then diesel.<ref name="splka.org">[http://splka.org/ Sable Points Lighthouse Keepers Association.]</ref>

Buildings at the lightstation included the tower and dwelling, fog signal building, boat house, barn, three oil houses, two [[Outhouse|privy's]] and a [[Diaphone]] fog signal.<ref>Thomas A. Tag, Big Sable Point Light Station, Softcover (Dayton, OH: Data Image, 1997) p. 36</ref>  The fog signal building fell into the lake due to erosion in 1943.<ref name="UNC">{{cite rowlett|miwl}}</ref>

The site is the subject of constant erosion, so that keeping the foundation in place and the water away from undermining it has been a recurrent and expensive battle.<ref name="Harrison"/>

Listed as Big Sable Point Light Station in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983 as reference #83004296.  It is also on the state inventory list.

A historical marker in front of the lighthouse reads:

:''Called Grande Pointe au Sable by French explorers and traders, Big Sable Point was an important landmark for mariners traveling a treacherous stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline between Big Sable Point and present-day Ludington. In 1855 twelve ships wrecked in that area. Commerce linked to the burgeoning lumber industry required Big Sable Point be suitably lighted. State Senator Charles Mears pressed the legislature to ask the federal government for a light station at Big Sable. In 1866 the U.S. Congress appropriated $35,000 for a lighthouse, which was built the following year. As the lumbering era waned, steamers carrying coal foodstuffs and tourists continued to rely on the lighthouse for navigation.''

:''The Big Sable Point Lighthouse is one of the few Michigan lights with a tower reaching {{convert|100|ft|m}}. Completed in 1867 Big Sable's tower measured {{convert|112|ft|m}} high. In 1900 the deteriorating brick tower was encased in steel. The keeper's dwelling, which once housed a single family, has been enlarged over the years, resulting in the present three-family residence. Indoor plumbing and heating and a diesel electric generator were added in 1953. In 1953 power lines were extended to the Point. In 1966 the tradition of light-keeping begun in 1867 by Alonzo A. Hyde and his wife Laura ended when the station was fully automated. Big Sable Point Light Station is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.'' <ref>[http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=L1518.htm Michigan Historical Marker.]<!--Assumed to be PD since it is the text of a public sign--></ref><ref name="friends">[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=196 Lighthouse friends article, Big Sable Point.]</ref>

==Current status and getting there==
The lighthouse was transferred to state ownership on November 1, 2002.<ref>[[National Park Service]] [http://www.cr.nps.gov/maritime/light/bigsable.htm Maritime History Project, Inventory of Historic Light Stations - Big Sable Point Lighthouse.]</ref>  The site manager is the [http://splka.org/ Sable Points Light Keepers Association.]<ref name="UNC"/>

Take state highway [[M-116 (Michigan highway)|M-116]] north from Ludington to Lakeshore Drive.  Proceed north for {{convert|6.5|mi|sing=on}}<ref name="friends"/> to Ludington State Park.  A vehicle permit is required and a fee collected.  It is under the care of the Sable Point Lightkeepers Association, which was formed in 1986.  The organization has been instrumental in restoring the light and associated buildings.<ref name="splka.org"/>  A volunteer keeper program makes is possible for volunteers to live and work in the lighthouse for two week periods.<ref>[http://www.lighthousedepot.com/lite_digest.asp?action=get_article&sk=1618 Merkel, Jim ''Volunteers Get Inside Look at Big Sable''] [[Lighthouse Digest]] (June, 2003).</ref>  There is a waiting list to do this.  Tours are available, and events do occur (a calendar is available).

Bus transportation is available the third Saturday of July, August and September.  Buses travel from the State Park Visitors Center to the lighthouse is from 10am to 5pm.  Round trip cost is $2.00 per rider, with a maximum of $10.00 per family. Among them are scheduled bus tours on specified weekends.<ref name="official">[http://www.bigsablelighthouse.org/ Big Sable Point Light official site.]</ref>

Otherwise, access requires a {{convert|1.5|mi|sing=on}} walk up the beach or hiking trail.<ref name="official"/>
