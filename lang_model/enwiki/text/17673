'''''Metroid Dread''''' is a [[Metroid series|''Metroid'']] [[video game]] in development by [[Nintendo]]. It is believed to have been cancelled, but this appears to have been contradicted by reports from both [[IGN]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]].

==History==
''Dread'' was first announced in the June [[2005]] issue of [[Game Informer]], and further details emerged on the magazine's [[Internet forum]]s. According to the forum moderators, the game was a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling game|side-scroller]] being developed for the [[Nintendo DS]], and its story was set after the events of ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''<ref name="giforums">"[http://forums.gameinformer.com/gi/board/message?board.id=ask_gi&message.id=53605&view=by_date_ascending&page=1 Ask GI: Metroid Dread?]". ''[http://forums.gameinformer.com/gi Game Informer Forums]''. Accessed on [[August 21]], [[2005]].</ref>.

On [[September 19]], [[2005]], [[IGN]] reported that ''Dread'' is indeed in development but will probably not be announced for some time{{ref|ignmail}}. [[Nintendo]] had neither confirmed nor denied its existence.<ref name="ignmail">"[http://ds.ign.com/mail/2005-09-19.html Nintendo DS Mailbag]". ''[[IGN]]''. [[September 19]], [[2005]].</ref>

On [[October 7]], [[2005]], the Nintendo-Next website reported that the project is dead, but did not reveal their sources.<ref name=n-next">"[http://www.n-next.com/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1128721775&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2& Metroid Dread - Canceled?]". ''[http://www.n-next.com/ Nintendo-Next]''. [[October 7]], [[2005]].</ref><!-- Note: Source acquired by Nintendo-Next unknown. -->

On [[February 17]], [[2006]], the British [[Official Nintendo Magazine (ONM)|Official Nintendo Magazine]] included ''Metroid Dread'' in their "Official Release Dates", listed under November 2006, albeit as 'TBC' (to be confirmed). However, on [[March 16]], 2006, in the second issue of the magazine, the game was marked with a vague '2006' release date, although ONM highlighted the ambiguity surrounding the game, and suggested to wait until E3 2006 for some more concrete information.

On [[March 23]], [[2006]], the website [[N-Sider]] reported that the [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris was asked about ''Metroid Dread'', and his response was that it was too early to show at [[E3]] in 2005, but that it could be shown later this year.  This lends credence to the possibility that the game has not been cancelled, and that this could have been reported falsely. <ref name="n-sider">Bayer, Glen "[http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1866 GDC: Spore on Nintendo DS, New Super Mario Bros. videos, more]" [http://www.n-sider.com/ N-Sider.com].</ref>
The game failed to make an appearance at E3 2006.
