'''''Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs''''', usually referred to as simply '''''Animaniacs''''', is an American [[list of animated television series|animated series]], distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The cartoon was the second animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation in the United States|animation renaissance]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The studio's first series, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', was a success among younger viewers, and attracted a sizable number of adult viewers. The ''Animaniacs'' writers and animators, led by senior producer [[Tom Ruegger]], used the experience gained from the previous series to create new animated characters that were cast in the mold of [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Tex Avery]]'s creations.<ref name="Spielberg1">{{citation| last =Carugati| first =Anna| title =Interviews: Steven Spielberg| work =World Screen | publisher =WSN Inc.|month=October | year=2006 | url = http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071011232156/http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm| doi =| accessdate = 2007-05-08 | archivedate = 2010-05-07}}</ref>

The comedy of ''Animaniacs'' was a broad mix of old-fashioned wit, [[slapstick]], [[pop culture]] references,<ref name=chicagotribune>{{cite news|last=Liebenson|first=Donald|title=Driving You Wakko: 'Animaniacs' Bits Sound Familiar Because They Are|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-03-07/features/9503080221_1_animaniacs-yakko-duck-soup|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=March 7, 1995|location=USA}}</ref> and [[violence in cartoons|cartoon violence]] and wackiness. The show featured a number of comedic educational segments that covered subjects such as history, mathematics, geography, astronomy, science, and social studies, often in musical form.  ''Animaniacs'' itself was a variety show, with short [[sketch comedy|skit]]s featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments.

''Animaniacs'' first aired on "[[Fox Kids]]" from 1993 to 1995 and new episodes later appeared on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] from 1995 to 1998 as part of its "[[Kids' WB]]" afternoon programming block. The series had a total of 99 episodes and one film, titled ''[[Wakko's Wish]]''.  It later aired on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons Network]], and [[Cartoon Network]] in syndication.

==Background==
===Premise===
The [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Warner siblings]] and the other characters lived in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name="creation"/>  However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The ''Animaniacs'' characters interacted with famous persons and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from modern television. Andrea Romano, the voice director and caster for Animaniacs, said that the Warner siblings functioned to "tie the show together," by appearing in and introducing other characters' segments.<ref name="dvdint1"/>  Each ''Animaniacs'' episode usually consisted of two or three cartoon shorts.<ref name = "airdate1"/>  ''Animaniacs'' segments ranged in time, from bridging segments less than a minute long to episodes spanning the entire show length; writer Peter Hastings said that the varying episode lengths gave the show a "sketch comedy" atmosphere.<ref name="dvdint2">{{cite video| people = Maurice LaMarche, Tom Ruegger, ''et al'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 2.

===Characters===
[[File:Totallyinsaney.jpg|right|thumb|''Animaniacs'' had a wide cast of characters. Shown here are the majority of the characters from the series.]]
{{See also|List of Animaniacs characters}}
''Animaniacs'' had a large cast of characters, separated into separate segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped.<ref name="creation">{{cite episode | title = Newsreel of the Stars | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-09-13 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref>  After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph, the security guard; [[List of Animaniacs characters|Dr. Otto Scratchansniff]], the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant [[List of Animaniacs characters|Hello Nurse]].  [[Pinky and the Brain]] are two genetically altered laboratory mice that continuously plot and attempt to take over the world.<ref name="pinkyandthebrain">{{cite episode | title = Win Big | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-09-14 | season = 1 | number = 2}}</ref> [[Slappy Squirrel]] is an aged cartoon star that would easily outwit antagonists and educate her nephew, [[Skippy Squirrel]], about cartoon techniques.<ref name="Slappy">{{cite episode | title = Slappy Goes Walnuts | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-09-15 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Additional principal characters included [[Rita and Runt]], [[List of Animaniacs characters#Buttons and Mindy|Buttons and Mindy]], [[Chicken Boo]], [[List of Animaniacs characters#Flavio and Marita|Flavio and Marita]] (The Hip Hippos), [[Katie Ka-Boom]], a trio of pigeons known as The [[List of Animaniacs characters#The Goodfeathers|Goodfeathers]], and Minerva Mink.

===Creation and inspiration===
The ''Animaniacs'' cast of characters had a variety of inspiration, from celebrities to writers' family members to other writers. Executive Producer Steven Spielberg said that the irreverence in [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons inspired the ''Animaniacs'' cast.<ref name="Spielberg1"/> The general premise of ''Animaniacs'' and the Warner siblings were created by Tom Ruegger, who also came up with the concept and characters for [[Pinky and the Brain]]. Ruegger was also the senior producer and creative leader of the show. Writer Deanna Oliver contributed ''The Goodfeathers'' scripts and the character ''Chicken Boo''.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Producer and writer Sherri Stoner contributed heavily to ''Slappy Squirrel'' and ''Pinky and the Brain''.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Nicholas Hollander based ''Katie Kaboom'' on his teenage daughter.<ref name = "dvdint2"/>

Senior Producer Tom Ruegger modeled the Warners<U+2019> personalities heavily after those of his three sons.<ref name="origin1">{{Citation|author =| title=TV Production: What a Character! Part II of a series: The Evolution of Animaniacs |magazine=Animation Magazine |page=12|date=July 1995}}</ref>  Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early [[The Golden Age of American animation|1930s]], Ruegger and other artists for ''Animaniacs'' made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s.<ref name="origin1"/> Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as<!-- 

Please restrain your intense urge to list more early cartoon characters here. Five major characters are listed already, and eight more are not going to clarify anything.

--> [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and the early versions of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]]. 

Tom Ruegger created [[Pinky and the Brain]] after being inspired by the personalities of two of his ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise of ''Pinky and the Brain'' when he wondered what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world.<ref name="pinkyorigin">{{Citation|last =Will| first= Ed |title= Brain Power: Pinky, genius pal to resume plotting in 1997|newspaper= The Denver Post |date=June 11, 1996}}</ref>

Sherri Stoner created Slappy the Squirrel when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner<U+2019>s career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, Sherri developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager.<ref name="dvdint2"/> Sherri Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and "have the dirt on [them]".<ref name="dvdint1"/>

==Production==
===Producers===
[[Steven Spielberg]] was the executive producer during the entire run, Tom Ruegger was the senior producer, Jean MacCurdy was the executive in charge of production, and Rich Arons, Sherri Stoner, Peter Hastings, Rusty Mills, and Liz Holzman were producers of the show. The producers of the show usually had other jobs on the series; Tom Ruegger, Rich Arons, and Sherri Stoner all served as writers, and Spielberg was very involved in the show<U+2019>s writing, checking every script for the series.<ref name = "airdate1"/> Voice director Andrea Romano said that Spielberg also came up with story ideas, read storyboards, and came to recording sessions.<ref name="dvdint1">{{cite video| people = Maurice LaMarche, ''et al'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1. Special Features: Animaniacs Live! | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video |date = 2006 }}</ref>

===Writers===
Writers for ''Animaniacs'' included writers [[Tom Ruegger]], [[Sherri Stoner]] and [[Paul Rugg]],  [[Deanna Oliver]], [[John P. McCann|John McCann]], Nicholas Hollander, Peter Hastings, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, [[Tom Minton]], and Randy Rogel. Writers Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in sketch comedy.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Other writers for the series came from cartoon backgrounds, including Kress, Minton, and Randy Rogel.<ref name="dvdint2"/>

Made-up stories did not exclusively comprise ''Animaniacs'' writing, as writer Peter Hastings said: "We weren<U+2019>t really there to tell compelling stories(...)  [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial(...) you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up."<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Writers for the series wrote into ''Animaniacs'' stories that happened to them; the episodes "Ups and Downs," "Survey Ladies," and "I Got Yer Can" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Paul Rugg,<ref name="dvdint3a"/> Deanna Oliver, and Sherri Stoner,<ref name="dvdint2"/> respectively. Another episode, "Bumbi<U+2019>s Mom," both parodied the film ''Bambi'' and was a story based on Stoner<U+2019>s childhood reaction to the film.<ref name="dvdint1"/>

In an interview, writers for the series said that ''Animaniacs'' allowed for non-restrictive and open writing.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Writer Peter Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because ''Animaniacs'' segments could widely vary in both time and subject.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Writer Sherri Stoner said that the ''Animaniacs'' writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode "The Three Muska-Warners".<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Writers Rugg, Hastings and Stoner said that the ''Animaniacs'' writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about and parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.<ref name="dvdint2"/>

===Voicing===
The ''Animaniacs'' voice cast came from ''Animaniacs'' predecessor, ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', including the voices of Yakko and Dot, [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Tress MacNeille]], respectively. Andrea Romano, the voice director and caster for ''Animaniacs'', said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: "We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko." Paulsen also played the roles of Pinky and Dr. Otto Scratchansniff.<ref name = "airdate1"/>  Romano said that the casters had "no trouble" choosing the role of Dot: "Tress MacNeille was just hilarious (...) And yet [she had] that edge."<ref name="dvdint1"/> The voice of Wakko, [[Jess Harnell]], on the other hand, did not come from ''Tiny Toons'', and said that before Animaniacs, he had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which he "fell into".<ref name="dvdint1"/> Harnell said that at the audition for the show, he did a [[John Lennon]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] and the audition "went great".<ref name="dvdint1"/>  Producer and writer [[Sherri Stoner]] voiced Slappy the Squirrel. Stoner said that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should fill the role.<ref name="dvdint1"/>  The voice actress who played the voice of Rita, [[Bernadette Peters]], is a [[Tony Award]]-winning [[musical theatre]] actress, and Romano herself wanted her for the role.<ref name="dvdint1"/> Other voice actors included [[Maurice LaMarche]], the voice of the Brain, Squit, and the belching segments "The Great Wakkorotti" (Jess Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role);<ref name="dvdint1"/> [[Frank Welker]], the voice of Runt; and various voices by [[Jim Cummings]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]], [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Gail Matthius]] (from Tiny Toon Adventures). Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles on the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, nephew to Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced ''The Flame'' in historical segments on ''Animaniacs''; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from ''Wild Blue Yonder''.

===Animation===
Animation work on ''Animaniacs'' was farmed out to several different studios, both American and international, over the course of the show<U+2019>s production. The animation companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>{{cite news|last=Owens|first=John|title=Drawing On Experience|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1992}}</ref> [[Wang Film Productions]], Freelance Animators New Zealand, and [[AKOM]], and most ''Animaniacs'' episodes frequently had animation from different companies in each episode's respective segments.<ref>Credits from various ''Animaniacs'' episodes.</ref>

''Animaniacs'' was made with a higher production value than standard television animation; the show had a higher [[cel]] count than most TV cartoons.<ref name="dvdint3a">{{cite video| people = Tom Ruegger, ''et al'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 3. Special Features: They Can't Help It If They're Cute, They're Just Drawn That Way | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video |date = 2007 }}</ref> The ''Animaniacs'' characters often move fluidly, and do not regularly stand still and speak, as in other television cartoons like [[Tiny Toon Adventures]] or [[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper|Casper]].<ref name="dvdint3a"/>

===Music===
''Animaniacs'' was a very musical cartoon, with every episode featuring at least one original score. The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg.<ref name="music">{{Citation| last=Schmuckler | first=Eric| date =April 17, 1995 | title= The new face in toontown. (Kids WB chief Jamie Kellner) (Special Report: Kids TV). | periodical=Mediaweek | volume=5 | issue=16 | page=22}}</ref>   ''Animaniacs'' used a 35-piece orchestra,{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} and was scored by a team of composers, led by supervising composer [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]]. The composing team included Steve and Julie Bernstein, Carl Johnson, Gordon Goodwin and Tim Kelly.<ref name="dvdint1"/>  The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with ''Animaniacs'' predecessor, ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in ''Animaniacs''.<ref name="dvdint1"/>  Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, "the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation," said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series.<ref name="music"/>  Assistant composers Steve and Julie Bernstein said that not only was the ''Animaniacs'' music written in the same style as that of ''Looney Tunes'' composer [[Carl Stalling]], but that the music used the same studio and piano that Carl Stalling used.<ref name="dvdint1"/>  Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote "a lot of music" for the series.<ref name="dvdint2"/>

''Animaniacs'' had a variety of music types. Many ''Animaniacs'' songs were parodies of classical or folk music with a educational lyrics, such as "Wakko's America", which listed all the states in the U.S. and their capitals to the tune of [[Turkey in the Straw]].<ref name="America">{{cite episode | title = Wakko<U+2019>s America | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-10-11 | season = 1 | number = 25}}</ref><ref name="wakkotune">{{Citation|last = Shapiro  | first = Craig  |  title = Kidvid: No Case is Too Thorny for the Olsen Twins to Crack |  newspaper = The Virginian-Pilot  |  date = September 13, 1994}}</ref>  Another song, titled "The Presidents", named every US president (up to [[Bill Clinton]], due to production date) to the tune of the [[William Tell Overture]].<ref name="presidents">{{cite episode | title = The Presidents | series = Animaniacs | network = Kids' WB | airdate = 1995-11-11 | season = 3 | number = 75}}</ref><ref name="presidenttune">{{Citation|last = Jones  | first = Rebecca  |  title = Rin Tin Tin Named After Finger Puppets |  newspaper = Rocky Mountain News  |  date = August 27, 2000}}</ref> Another song had Yakko listing the "Nations of the World" to the tune of the [[Mexican Hat Dance]].

The ''Animaniacs'' series theme song, performed by the Warners, was a very important part of the show.  In the series' first season, the theme won an [[Emmy Award]] for best song.<ref name="emmyaward1">{{citation|url=http://wba.toonzone.net/archives/94.html|title=Warner Bros.

==Hallmarks and humor==
<!-- ANCHORUSED [[Pinky and the Brain#Humor]] includes a link to here, please do not rename this section without also changing that link to match! -->
The humor of ''Animaniacs'' varied in type, ranging from parody to cartoon violence.  The series made parodies of television shows and films.  In an interview, Spielberg defended the "irreverence" of ''Animaniacs'', saying that the ''Animaniacs'' crew has "a point of view" and does not "sit back passively and play both sides equally".<ref name="Spielberg2">{{Citation| last = Closs| first = Larry| title = Spielberg Toons In: Moviemaker extraordinaire Steven Spielberg reveals he<U+2019>s also an animaniac at heart| periodical = TV Guide| pages = 33<U+2013>36| date = October 28, 1995| url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html}}</ref>  Spielberg also said that ''Animaniacs''' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the [[Marx Brothers]]<ref name="Spielberg2"/> and [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons.<ref name="Spielberg1"/>  ''Animaniacs'', among other Spielberg-produced shows, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in ''Animaniacs'' by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never become either too violent or "benign".<ref name="Spielberg2"/> ''Animaniacs'' also made use of catchphrases, recurring jokes and segments, and "adult" humor.

===Recurring jokes and catchphrases===
Characters on ''Animaniacs'' had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko<U+2019>s "Goodnight, everybody!" often said following adult humor, Wakko's "Faboo!", and Dot<U+2019>s frequent assertions of her cuteness.  The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was "Hello-o-o, nurse!"<ref name="creation"/>  Tom Ruegger said that the "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like [[Bugs Bunny]]'s line, "What's up, doc?"<ref name="dvdint3a"/> Characters Pinky and the Brain had a catchphrase where Brain would ask Pinky, "Are you pondering what I<U+2019>m pondering?" to which Pinky would always respond with a non-sequitur. At the start of all Pinky and the Brain episodes, Pinky asks "Gee Brain, what do you want to do tonight?", to which Brain answers "The same thing we do every night, Pinky... try to take over the world!"  in a segment that preceded the theme song. Also, Brain would shout "Yes!" in response to an idea that he liked.<ref name="pinkyandthebrain"/>  Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode "Win Big," and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.<ref name="dvdint2"/> Pinky had several verbal tics, recurring throughout the series, notably 'narf!' which featured at the end of the theme tune. Skippy Squirrel had the catchphrase, "Spew!" which was used whenever something disgusting was brought up. Slappy had the catchphrase, "Now ''that's'' comedy!" which she would deliver at the end of every Slappy Squirrel cartoon.<ref name="Slappy"/>

[[Running gags]] and recurring segments were very common in the show. One example is the close-up of the Warner's water tower after the closing credits; right before the end of the episode, the water tower door would open, one or more of the characters would come out, say something to the audience, and the water tower door would close.<ref name="credits">{{cite episode | title = Closing Credits | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-09-13 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref> Something similar happened in the last few lines of the opening theme, where after the phrase "We're Animaney, Totally Insane-y", one or more of the Warners would chime in with a rhyming phrase. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag, such as the segment ''The Wheel of Morality'', eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once.<ref name="dvdint3a"/>  ''The Wheel of Morality'' was also used to take up time in an episode that was running short.<ref name="dvdint3a"/>

Another running gag was that characters would make a brief appearance in other characters' segments and sometimes point out that they are not in the correct episode. ''Animaniacs'' even devoted an entire episode to characters and segments being switched around.<ref name="switch">{{cite episode | title = Very Special Opening; In the Garden of Mindy; No Place Like Homeless; Katie Ka-Boo; Baghdad Cafe | series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-11-05 | season = 1 | number = 35}}</ref>  Characters from ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' also made appearances in some episodes of ''Animaniacs''. Because of Steven Spielberg's involvement in the series, a running gag was that his films were mentioned in the series and even a caricature of Spielberg himself appeared a few times; for instance, in the episode "Hooked on a Ceiling", Spielberg was made "[[His Eminence|eminence]]" of the [[Sistine Chapel]], and the Warners painted an ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' picture on its ceiling (in the place of God) reaching out to Elliott (in place of Adam).<ref name="ceiling">{{cite episode | title = Hooked on a Ceiling| series = Animaniacs | network = Fox Kids | airdate = 1993-09-16 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref>

===Humor and content intended for adults===
A great deal of Animaniacs' humor and content was aimed at an adult audience. The [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' were [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan|parodied in episode 3, "HMS Yakko"]].  ''Animaniacs'' parodied the film ''A Hard Day's Night'' and the [[Three Tenors]], references that ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote were "appealing to older audiences".<ref name="adultjokes">{{Citation | last = Strauss  | first = Neil |  author-link = Neil Strauss |  title = The Pop Life  |  url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&sq=yakko'sworld&st=nyt&pagewanted=2  |  page = 2 | newspaper = The New York Times  |  date = October 27, 1994}}</ref>  Some content of ''Animaniacs'' was not only aimed at an adult audience but were suggestive in nature. For example, one character, [[Minerva Mink]] had episodes that network censors considered too sexually suggestive for the show's intended audience, for which she was soon de-emphasized as a featured character.<ref name="dvdint1"/> The word ''sexy'' was said twice in the series. In the episode ''Turkey Jerky'', a pilgrim says "Give me the bird", Yakko responds saying "we'd love to, really, but the Fox censors won't allow it".

The ''Animaniacs'' characters had personalities and character traits similar to those of film stars in movies marketed to adults. The Warners personalities were made similar to those of the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis, in that they, according to writer Peter Hastings, "wreak havoc," in "serious situations".<ref name="dvdint2"/>  In addition, the show's recurring [[Goodfeathers]] segment was populated with characters based on characters from the 1990 WB film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', an R-rated crime drama neither marketed nor intended for children.<ref name="dvdint1"/>

[[File:AnimaniacsLewis.jpg|right|thumb|Parodies and caricatures made up a large part of ''Animaniacs''. The episode "Hello, Nice Warners" introduced a [[Jerry Lewis]] caricature (left), who made occasional appearances on the series and movie.]]

===Parodies===
{{Main|Parodies in Animaniacs}}
''Animaniacs'' parodied popular TV shows and movies and caricatured celebrities.<ref name="dvdint3a"/>  One episode even made fun of a large ''Animaniacs'' competitor, [[Power Rangers]],<ref name="Spielberg2"/> and another episode caricatured ''Animaniacs<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' own Internet fans.<ref name="getalife">{{cite episode | title = The Please Please Please Get a Life Foundation | series = Animaniacs | network =  Kids<U+2019> WB | airdate = 1995-09-23 | season = 3 | number = 73}}</ref> ''Animaniacs'' spoofs were multi-layered, with the episode parodying one specific subject and referencing other subjects along the way. For instance, the episode "Hooked on a Ceiling" did not only parody ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (film)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'', but it also featured [[Quasimodo]] shouting "Sanctuary! Sanctuary!", a reference to ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.<ref name="ceiling"/>  ''Animaniacs'' made fun of celebrities, major motion pictures, television shows for adults (''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', among others), television shows for children, and trends in the US.  ''Animaniacs'' also made potshots of Disney films, creating parodies of such films as ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', and others.  ''Animaniacs'' Director Russell Calabrese said that not only did it become a compliment to be parodied on ''Animaniacs'' but also that being parodied on the series would be taken as a "badge of honor".<ref name="dvdint3a"/>

==Response==
''Animaniacs'' became a very successful show, gathering both child and adult fans. The series received ratings higher than its competitors and won eight Daytime Emmy Awards and one Peabody Award.

The series gained high ratings even under disadvantageous circumstances.

{{See also|List of Animaniacs episodes}}

===Preproduction===
Before ''Animaniacs'' was put into production, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were [[Rita and Runt]] being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that Senior Producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years.<ref name="dvdint3a"/>  After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into ''Animaniacs'' (the characters [[Buttons and Mindy]] were chosen by Spielberg's daughter).<ref name="dvdint3a"/>  The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers,<ref name="pinkyorigin"/> designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.<ref name="dvdint3a"/>

After ''Animaniacs'', Spielberg collaborated with Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. also produced three other series in the later half of the decade titled ''[[Histeria!]]'', ''[[Toonsylvania]]'', and ''[[Detention (TV series)|Detention]]''.

In April 2010, a discussion at the Home Theater Forum with Warner Home Video representatives revealed that Warner Bros. has "no plans at this time" for more ''Animaniacs'' releases on [[DVD]].<ref name="noplans">{{citation

===Print===
An ''Animaniacs'' comic book, published by [[DC Comics]], ran from 1995 to 2000 (59 regular monthly issues, plus two specials). Initially, these featured all the characters except for Pinky and the Brain, who were published in their own comic series, though cameos were possible.  The ''Animaniacs'' comic series was later renamed ''Animaniacs! featuring Pinky and the Brain''.<ref name="animaniacscomic">{{citation | url = http://toonzone.net/comics/anim00.php | title = Toon Zone - Comics - Aniamniacs | accessdate = 2010-04-11| author = | last = | first =  |date = | work = Toon Zone Comics | publisher = Toon Zone | quote = }}</ref>  The ''Animaniacs'' comic series, like the show, parodied TV and comics standards, such as ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', among others.

===Video games===
''Animaniacs'' was soon brought into the [[video game]] industry to produce games based on the series. Early notable games were Play Zone!'s [[PC game]] ''[[Animaniacs Game Pack]]!''
