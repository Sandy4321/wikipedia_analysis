==Reception==
Schlosser's work has received positive reviews from across the political spectrum. [[William F. Buckley]] gave ''Reefer Madness'' a positive review,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/buckley061003.asp |title=Reefer Madness |publisher=nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref> as did ''Business Week''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_20/b3833046_mz005.htm |title=What Is America Smoking? |publisher=businessweek.com |date=2003-05-19 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref> and the ''Financial Times''.

==Films==
Schlosser appeared in an interview for the DVD of [[Morgan Spurlock]]'s ''[[Super Size Me]]'', having a one-on-one discussion with the filmmaker about the fast-food industry. He declined to appear in the film itself. He made a public appearance along with [[Robert Kenner]], Alice Waters, Gary Hirshberg, and Marcel Van Ooyen on June 5, 2009 at the Times Center in NYC following the screening of his new film ''[[Food, Inc. (film)|Food, Inc.]]'' presented by the Museum of the Moving Image. Food Inc. explores the way the American food supply is now controlled by a handful of corporations that often put profit ahead of consumer health, the livelihood of the American farmer, the safety of workers and our own environment. Owen Gleiberman, film critic for Entertainment Weekly, wrote "I'm not generally in the habit of praising documentaries for being good for you, but Food, Inc. is more than a terrific movie<U+2014>it's an important movie, one that nourishes your knowledge of how the world works (or, in this case, has started not to work)." 

He was interviewed by [[Franny Armstrong]] in 2005 and is a feature interviewee in her film ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]''.

Schlosser also served as an executive producer on the 2007 film ''[[There Will Be Blood]]''.

== Food industry's reaction to Schlosser's work ==
In May 2006, Schlosser and his co-author Charles Wilson released a children's book entitled ''Chew On This''. The book, along with increasing publicity for the Hollywood movie based on ''Fast Food Nation'', resulted in 18 food industry associations launching the [http://www.bestfoodnation.com www.bestfoodnation.com] website as part of a major public relations campaign. The site presents statements about health and labor practices in the American beef, pork, dairy, potato and other industries.  However, this website is no longer in operation.

When asked how much cooperation the meatpacking and fast food industries lent to his research of Fast Food Nation, Schlosser said the following: "None of the major meatpacking companies allowed me to visit their facilities. McDonald's was not at all helpful. The industry, on the whole, didn't roll out a welcome mat. But many of the workers at fast food restaurants and meatpacking plants were eager to talk with me. They felt that their stories had not yet been told, and they wanted the world to know what was happening. Their help made "Fast Food Nation" possible..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/523/schlosser-food-finances.html |title=Q & A: Eric Schlosser, author of 'Fast Food Nation,' on the state of the American food system . NOW on PBS |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>

As a result of Schlosser's criticisms of the food industry, he has been the victim of verbal attacks at book signings and public speaking events that he believes to be the work of citizens employed by large food corporations.  He has openly challenged many of the food corporations he feels responsible of tainting America's food system to public debates regarding their policies and regulations.  All such invitations have been declined with the exception of one British McDonald's executive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dclZxxaB6XE |title=McDonalds vs Schlosser |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ravat |first=Safiya |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7229113.html |title=Sunday Q&A: Author still a crusader for healthier food &#124; Houston & Texas News &#124; Chron.com - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>
