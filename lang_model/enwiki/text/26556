'''John William Colenso''' ([[1814]]&ndash;[[1883]]), first [[Anglican]] bishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Natal|Natal]], [[mathematician]], [[theologian]], [[Bible scholar]] and [[social activist]].

==Biography==

Colenso was born at [[St Austell]], [[Cornwall]], on [[January 24]] [[1814]].  His father (John Williams Colenso) invested his capital into a mineral works in [[Pentewan]], Cornwall, but the speculation proved to be ruinous when the investment was lost following a sea flood.  His cousin was [[William Colenso]], a missionary in New Zealand.

As a result of his family's financial problems, Colenso had to take a job as an usher in a private school to be able to afford to attend University.  These earnings and a loan of <U+00A3>30 raised by his relatives paid for his first year at St John's Cambridge where he won a scholarship. In [[1836]] he was [[Second Wrangler]] and [[Smith's Prize]]man at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and in [[1837]] he became fellow of [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]. Two years later he went to [[Harrow School]] as mathematical tutor, but the step proved an unfortunate one. The school was at its lowest ebb, and Colenso not only had few pupils, but lost most of his property in a fire. He went back to Cambridge, and in a short time paid off an enormous debt of <U+00A3>5,000.  The money was raised by diligent tutoring and the sale to [[Longmans]] of his copyright interest in the highly successful and widely read manuals he had written on algebra  (in 1841) and arithmetic (in 1843).

===Life in Africa===
In 1846 he became [[rector]] of [[Forncett St Mary]], [[Norfolk]], and in 1853 he was recruited by the [[Archbishop of Cape Town|Bishop of Cape Town]], [[Robert Gray (bishop)|Robert Gray]], to be the first [[Bishop of Natal]]. He arranged for a printing press to be brought to his missionary station at Ekukhanyeni in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and at once devoted himself to acquiring the [[Zulu language]] and compiling a grammar and a dictionary. He also introduced [[printing]] to the Zulu language, and many useful reading-books in the language.  He also translated the [[New Testament]] and other portions of Scripture into Zulu. 

Before his missionary career his volume of sermons dedicated to [[Frederick Maurice]] had signalled the critical approach he was interested in applying to biblical interpretation. After spending time in Natal, Colenso wrote a commentary upon the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' ([[1861]]) in which he contested the doctrine of eternal punishment and that Holy Communion was a precondition to salvation.  Colenso, in his missionary context, would not preach that the ancestors of newly Christianised Africans were condemned to eternal damnation.  The thought provoking questions put to him by students at his missionary station encouraged him to re-examine the contents of the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' and the ''[[Book of Joshua]]'' and question whether certain sections of these books should be understood as literally or historically accurate. His conclusions, positive and negative, were published in a series of treatises on the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' and the ''[[Book of Joshua]]'', over a period of time rom 1862 to 1879.  The publication of these volumes created a scandal in England and were the cause of a number of anguished counter-blasts from those (clergy and laity alike) who refused to countenance the possibility of biblical fallibility. Colenso's work attracted the notice of continental biblical academics and writers such as [[Abraham Kuenen]] and played an important contribution in the development of biblical scholarship.

==Controversy==
Colenso's biblical criticism and his liberal views about the treatment of African natives created a frenzy of alarm and opposition from the [[High Church]] party in South Africa and in England.  As controversy raged in England, the South African bishops headed by Bishop Gray pronounced Colenso's deposition in December 1863. Colenso, who had refused to appear before this tribunal otherwise than by sending a proxy protest, appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London.  The Privy Council eventually decided that the bishop of Cape Town had no coercive jurisdiction and no authority to interfere with the Bishop of Natal. In view of this finding of ''[[ultra vires]]'' there was no opinion given upon the allegations of heresy made against Colenso.

His adversaries, though unable to remove him from his episcopal office, succeeded in restricting his ability to preach both in Natal and in England.  Bishop Gray not only excommunicated him but consecrated a rival bishop of [[Anglican Diocese of Natal|Natal]] (WK Macrorie), who, however, took his title from [[Pietermaritzburg]]. The contributions of the missionary societies were withdrawn, but an attempt to deprive him of his episcopal income and the control of the cathedral was frustrated by another court ruling. Colenso, encouraged by a handsome testimonial raised in England, to which many clergymen subscribed, returned to his diocese, and devoted the latter years of his life to further labours as a biblical commentator and translator. He also championed the cause of the [[Zulu]]s against [[Boer]] oppression and [[Anglo-Zulu War|official encroachments]] and in so doing he made more enemies among the colonists than he had ever made among the clergy.  

==Death and legacy==
He died at [[Durban]] on [[June 20]], [[1883]]. His daughter Frances Ellen Colenso (1849-1887) published two books on the relations of the Zulus to the British (1880 and 1885), taking a pro-Zulu view; and an elder daughter, Harriette E Colenso (b. 1847), became prominent as an advocate of the Zulus in opposition to their treatment by Natal, especially in the case of [[Dinizulu]] in 1888<U+2014>1889 and in 1908<U+2014>1909. 

In the film [[Zulu Dawn]] Colenso is sympathetically portrayed ([[Freddie Jones]] acts the role) as a principled critic of the decision to declare war on [[Cetshwayo]] and the Zulus. In an article by Patrick Wright of Windhoekt, it has been argued that Colenso's career provides an interesting example of 19th century [[Liberation Theology]] and can be viewed as a "father" of the kind of [[Liberation Theology]] found in 20th century [[Latin America]].
