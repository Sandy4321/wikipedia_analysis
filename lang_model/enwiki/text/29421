'''Philippe <U+00C9>tancelin''' ([[December 29]], [[1896]] - [[October 13]], [[1981]]) was a French Grand Prix motor racing driver who joined the new [[Formula One]] circuit at its inception.

==Biography==
Born in [[Rouen]], [[Seine-Maritime]], in [[Normandy]], he began racing with a [[Bugatti]] in 1926, making an immediate impact by winning the Grand Prix de Reims. 

He worked as a merchant in the winter
and raced cars during the summer.<ref name=driver>''World's Best Drivers Vie For $60,000 In Cup Race'', [[Washington Post]], October 12, 1936, Page X15.</ref> 

His wife, Suzanne, served as his pit manager. Their three children were placed in a school in Rouen while she traveled with her husband to races around the world. She communicated with Etancelin through French sign language as he raced around the speedway. Suzanne told a reporter that Etancelin bought a
racing car to celebrate the birth of their second child, Jeanne Alice. He did not intend to race the car but merely use it for pleasure driving around the countryside. The couple once drove it up to a speed of 125 miles per hour. After two years of recreational motoring
Etancelin decided to enter a race.<ref name=pit/> 

Etancelin lost the lead to [[Giuseppe Campari]] on the final lap of the [[1933]] French Automobile Club race in [[Paris, France]]. The 19th annual event was 500 kilometers.<ref>''Campari Wins Paris Auto Race'',
[[New York Times]], June 12, 1933, Page 22.</ref> Nicknamed "Phi-Phi," he teamed up with [[Luigi Chinetti]] to win the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] in 1934. 

Etancelin was victorious in the [[1936]] [[Pau, France]] Grand Prix, driving an [[Alfa Romeo]]. He negotiated the 100
laps of the Grand Prix De Pau in 3 hours, twenty-two minutes, and 22
seconds.<ref>''Wins Grand Prix'', [[Olean, New York]] Times Herald, March 2, 1936, Page 13.</ref> Etancelin qualified 6th for the [[George Vanderbilt]] Cup, which was
raced over 300 miles near [[Westbury, New York]], in October 1936.
Drivers qualified over a 20 mile distance of hairpin turns and a main 
straightaway at 150 miles per hour on a new 4 mile circuit.<ref>''Nuvolari Tops Qualifiers for Auto Race'', Washington Post, October 8, 1936, Page X19.</ref> This was the million dollar [[Roosevelt Raceway]].<ref name=pit>''Vite! Vite! To Victory, Or-'', [[Edwardsville, Illinois]] Intelligencer, March 13, 1939, Page 5.</ref> By this time he had won the
[[Marne]] Grand Prix three times.<ref name=driver/> 

<U+00C9>tancelin participated in twelve World Championship F1 Grands Prix, debuting on May 13, 1950. He scored a total of 3 championship points.

His fifth place in the [[1950 Italian Grand Prix]] made him the oldest driver to score championship points.

In 1953 the government of France awarded him the [[Legion of Honor]] in recognition of his contribution to the sport of automobile racing that spanned four decades.

He died at [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in [[1981]].
