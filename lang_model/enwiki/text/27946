The '''CANada [[Deuterium]] [[Uranium]] reactor''' is a Canadian-invented, [[pressurized heavy water reactor]]. The acronym refers to its deuterium-oxide ([[heavy water]]) [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and its use of (originally, [[natural uranium|natural]]) [[uranium]] fuel. CANDU reactors were first developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by a partnership between [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL), the [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]] (now [[Ontario Power Generation]]), Canadian [[General Electric]] (now GE Canada), and other companies.
All current power reactors in [[Canada]] are of the CANDU type. The reactor is also marketed abroad. In December 2009, the Canadian Federal Government announced that they would be seeking private investors for a partial sell-off of its CANDU division.<ref>{{cite news | author = CBC |url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/12/17/candu-reactor.html | title = CANDU reactor division to be sold | date = 2009-12-17 | work=CBC News}}</ref>

The CANDU reactor is similar to most [[light water reactor]]s: [[nuclear fission|Fission]] reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized heavy water in a ''primary cooling loop''. A [[heat exchanger]] transfers the heat to a light-water ''secondary cooling loop'', which powers a steam [[turbine]] with an [[electrical generator]] attached to it. Excess heat in the steam after flowing through the turbine is disposed into cool water, from eg a lake, river or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]] near [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], use a diffuser to spread the warm water over a larger area and limit the effects on the environment. A [[cooling tower]] can be used, but it reduces efficiency.

In an [[LWR]], the entire reactor core is a single large pressure vessel containing the light water, which acts as moderator and coolant, and the fuel arranged in a series of long bundles running the length of the core. At the time of its design, Canada lacked the heavy industry to cast and machine the [[pressure vessel]]s.<ref name="Basic CANDU Design">[http://www.unene.ca/un802-2005/ben/BasicCANDUDesign.pdf Basic CANDU Design], 2005.</ref> In CANDU the pressure (and the fuel bundles) is contained in much smaller (10&nbsp;cm diameter), easier to fabricate tubes. Each bundle is a cylinder assembled from alloy tubes containing ceramic pellets of fuel. In older designs the assembly had 28 or 37 half-meter-long fuel tubes with 12 such assemblies lying end to end in a pressure tube. The newer [[CANFLEX]] bundle has 43 tubes, with two pellet sizes (so the power rating can be increased without melting the hottest pellets). It is about 10&nbsp;cm (four inches) in diameter, 0.5&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;inches) long and weighs about 20&nbsp;kg (44&nbsp;lb) and replaces the 37-tube bundle. To allow the [[neutron]]s to flow freely between the bundles, the tubes and bundles are made of neutron-transparent [[zircaloy]] ([[zirconium]] + 2.5% wt [[niobium]]).

The zircaloy tubes are surrounded by a much larger low-pressure tank known as a [[calandria]], which contains the majority of the moderator. To keep the hot coolant from boiling the moderator, a so-called calandria tube surrounds each pressure tube, with insulating [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] gas in between. Also slowing down neutrons releases energy, so a cooling system dissipates the heat. The moderator is actually a large [[heat sink]] that acts as an additional [[nuclear safety|safety]] feature. If a fuel assembly overheated and deformed, the pressure tube would buckle and touch the calandria tube, [[heat transfer|releasing heat]] to the cool moderator, preventing the fuel rods from [[nuclear meltdown|melting down]] and breaching the fuel channel. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter fuel pellet fission reaction, though not stopping heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. This would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The decay heat reduces as the half life of the fission products is relatively short. 

Normally the rate of fission is controlled by light-water compartments called liquid zone controllers, that absorb excess neutrons and by adjuster rods which can be raised or lowered in the core to control the neutron flux. There are two independent, fast-acting safety shutdown systems: Shutoff rods that drop under gravity into the core vertically, absorbing neutrons, and a secondary system injecting high-pressure [[gadolinium nitrate]] neutron absorber solution into the calandria.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#candu_control | title = Canadian Nuclear FAQ | work = The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock | accessdate=  2005-03-05 }}</ref> The reactor can be easily built to handle increased seismic stresses, if it's built in an earthquake-prone area.<ref>[http://www.iasmirt.org/SMiRT15/K13-1 Seismic Design and Analysis of CANDU Nuclear Power Plants], 1999.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iasmirt.org/SMiRT17/k01-4.pdf |title=Seismic Design Features of The ACR Nuclear Power Plant |year=2003}}</ref>

CANDU's fuel channels in a low-pressure calandria design makes it easier to refuel: a pressure-vessel reactor must be shut down, the pressure dropped, the lid removed, and a sizeable fraction of the fuel, e.g. one-third, replaced all at once. In CANDU individual channels can be refuelled without taking the reactor off-line, improving the [[capacity factor]]. One fueling machine inserts new fuel into one end of the channel while the other receives discharged fuel from the opposite end.

== Purpose of using heavy water ==
[[File:Bruce-Nuclear-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|right|The CANDU [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] is the second largest [[nuclear power]] plant in the world.]]

{{see|nuclear reactor physics|nuclear fission|heavy water}}

The main advantage of [[heavy water]] [[moderator]] over light water is reduced absorption of the neutrons that sustain the chain reaction, allowing a lower concentration of active atoms (to the point of using unenriched natural uranium fuel). Natural uranium is a mix of [[isotope]]s, mostly [[uranium-238]] and  0.72% (by weight) of fissile [[uranium-235]]. A nuclear reactor aims to sustain a steady rate of fission reactions over time, a state known as "[[critical mass|criticality]]": Neutrons released in fission cause an equal number of fission reactions  in other [[fissile|fissile atoms]].  These neutrons are fairly energetic and aren't easily captured; they must be slowed down ("moderated") as much as possible, ideally to the same energy as the atoms themselves ("[[thermal neutrons]]"). During the process it helps to separate the neutrons and uranium, since <sup>238</sup>U has a large affinity for intermediate energy neutrons ("resonance" absorption), but can only be easily fissioned by the few energetic neutrons above ~1.5-2 [[MeV]]. This is a fundamental reason for designing reactors with discrete solid fuel separated by moderator, rather than a mixture of the two. Light water makes an excellent moderator - the [[hydrogen|light hydrogen]] atoms are very close in mass to a neutron and can absorb a lot of energy in a single collision (like a collision of two billiard balls). However, light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, and there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of <sup>235</sup>U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. [[Deuterium]] ("heavy hydrogen") already has the extra neutron that light hydrogen would absorb, reducing the capture rate.

Deuterium is twice the mass of light hydrogen or a neutron; the mismatch means more collisions are needed to slow the neutrons, and a larger distance between the fuel rods. This increases the size of the reactor (it would mean a very large pressure vessel and was the final straw in favor of a calandria design)<ref name="Basic CANDU Design"/> and the leakage of neutrons. The lower <sup>235</sup>U density in natural uranium also generally implies that less of the fuel will be consumed before the fission rate drops too low to sustain criticality (due primarily to the relative depletion of <sup>235</sup>U compared with the build-up of parasitic [[fission product]]s). However, in CANDU most of the moderator is at lower temperatures than in other designs, reducing the spread of speeds and the overall speed of the moderator particles. This means most of the neutrons are at a lower energy and more likely to cause fission, so CANDU not only "burns" natural uranium, but does it more effectively as well. Overall CANDU reactors use 30<U+2013>40% less mined uranium than light-water reactors per unit of electricity produced (including savings on uranium enrichment).

Another solution, used in [[light water reactor]]s, is fuel [[enriched uranium|enriched]] to between 2% and 5% <sup>235</sup>U (the depleted fraction is called [[depleted uranium]]). However enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They're also a [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] concern as they can be used to enrich the <sup>235</sup>U much further, up to [[weapons-grade]] material (90% or more <sup>235</sup>U). Although this can be dealt with if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an [[International Atomic Energy Agency|internationally approved]] supplier.
Canada lacked access to enrichment facilities at the time, while America [[zippe-type centrifuge#centrifuge uranium enrichment|classified work on the cheaper gas centrifuge process]]. The CANDU was therefore designed to use natural uranium, like the first Canadian reactor [[ZEEP]]. 

A further unique feature of heavy-water moderation is the greater stability of the [[chain reaction]]. This is due to the relatively low binding energy of the deuterium nucleus (2.2 MeV), leading to some [[n,2n|energetic neutrons]] and especially [[Photodisintegration|gamma rays]] breaking the nuclei apart and producing extra neutrons. Both gammas produced directly by fission and by the decay of [[Nuclear fission products|fission fragments]] have enough energy, and the half-lives of the fission fragments range from seconds to hours or even years. As all neutrons are taken into account when performing any action, the presence of photoneutrons delays the [[Nuclear chain reaction#Timescales of nuclear chain reactions|response of the reactor]] and gives the operators extra time in case of an emergency. Since [[gamma ray]]s travel for meters through water, an increased rate of chain reaction in one part of the reactor will produce a response from the rest of the reactor, allowing various negative feedbacks to stabilize the reaction.

==Fuel cycles==
[[File:CANDU fuel cycles.jpg|thumb|right|400px|'''Range of possible CANDU fuel cycles:'''  CANDU reactors can accept a variety of fuel types, including the used fuel from light-water reactors.  Courtesy of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]].]]

A heavy water design can sustain a chain reaction with a lower concentration of fissile atoms than light water reactors, allowing it to use some alternative fuels. E.g., "recovered uranium" (RU) from used LWR fuel can be used. CANDU was designed for natural uranium with only 0.7% U-235, so RU with 0.9% U-235 is a rich fuel. This extracts a further 30-40% energy from the uranium. The DUPIC (''Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU'') process under development can recycle it even without reprocessing. The fuel is sintered in air (oxidized), then in hydrogen (reduced) to break it into a powder, which is then formed into CANDU fuel pellets.
CANDU can also [[thorium fuel cycle|breed fuel]] from the more abundant [[thorium]]. This is being [[thorium fuel cycle|investigated]] by India to take advantage of its natural thorium reserves.

Even [[MOX fuel#Overview|better than LWRs]], CANDU can burn [[mixed oxide fuel|a mix]] of uranium and plutonium, the plutonium either from dismantled [[nuclear weapon]]s or reprocessed reactor fuel. The mix of isotopes in reprocessed plutonium is not attractive for weapons, but can be used as fuel (instead of being simply nuclear waste), while burning weapons plutonium eliminates a proliferation hazard. 
If the aim is explicitly to burn plutonium and/or other [[actinide]]s from spent fuel, then special inert-matrix fuels are proposed to do this more efficiently than MOX. Since they contain no uranium, they do not breed any extra plutonium while burning it.

==Chronology==
The first CANDU-type reactor was [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), in Rolphton, Ontario. It was intended as a proof-of-concept and rated for only 22 [[MWe]], a very low power for a commercial power reactor.  NPD produced the first nuclear-generated electricity in Canada, and ran successfully from 1962 to 1987.<ref>{{cite web | author = Canadian Nuclear Society |url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/event/npd/npd_main_eng.htm | title = NPD Historical Plaque | date = 2007-07-07}} {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-75-104-896/science_technology/candu/clip3] {{Dead link|date=May 2008}}</ref>

The second CANDU was the [[Douglas Point]] reactor, a more powerful version rated at roughly 200 [[MWe]] and located near [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]], Ontario.  It went into service in 1968, and ran until 1984. Uniquely among CANDU stations, Douglas Point had an oil-filled window with a view of the east reactor face, even when the reactor was operating.  The Douglas Point type was exported to [[India]], and was the basis for India's fleet of domestically designed and built "CANDU-derivatives". Douglas Point was originally planned to be a two-unit station, but the second unit was cancelled because of the success of the larger 515 MWe units at [[Pickering Nuclear Generating Station|Pickering]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/DouglasPoint.html | author = Canadian Nuclear Society | title = The Douglas Point Story|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080517095721/http%3A//www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/DouglasPoint.html |archivedate = May 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/AECL-2400/AECL2400-1.html | author = Canadian Nuclear Society | title = Douglas Point Nuclear Power Station|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080319113419/http%3A//www.cns-snc.ca/history/DouglasPoint/AECL-2400/AECL2400-1.html |archivedate = March 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
[[File:Centrale nucl<U+00E9>aire Gentilly.jpg|thumb|left|The Gentilly-1 nuclear generating station (right), in [[B<U+00E9>cancour, Quebec]], was closed in the late 1970s. The Gentilly-2 plant (left), a CANDU-6 reactor, is operational since 1983. It is owned and operated by [[Hydro-Qu<U+00E9>bec]].]]
In parallel with the classic CANDU design, experimental variants were being developed.  [[WR-1]], located at the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]]'s [[Whiteshell Laboratories]] in [[Pinawa, Manitoba]], used vertical pressure tubes and organic [[Petroleum|oil]] as the primary coolant.  The oil used has a higher boiling point than water, allowing the reactor to operate at higher temperatures and lower pressures than a conventional reactor.  WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.  [[Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station|Gentilly-1]], near [[Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res]], [[Quebec]], was also an experimental version of CANDU, using a boiling light-water coolant and vertical pressure tubes, but was not considered successful and closed after seven years of fitful operation.

The successes at NPD and Douglas Point led to the decision to construct the first multi-unit station in Pickering, Ontario.  Pickering A, consisting of Units 1 to 4, went into service in 1971.  Pickering B with units 5 to 8 came online in 1983, giving a full-station capacity of 4,120 MWe.  The station is very close to the city of [[Toronto]], in order to reduce [[electric power transmission|transmission]] costs.

Pickering A was placed into voluntary lay-up in 1997, as a part of [[Ontario Hydro]]'s Nuclear Improvement plan.<ref>Ontario Hydro was split up into five successor companies in 1999 and the electricity generating division of Ontario Hydro was named [[Ontario Power Generation]].</ref>  Units 1 and 4 have since returned to service, although with significant cost overruns on Unit 4. (Unit 1 was essentially on-time and on-budget.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.opg.com/pdf/pickbfaqs.pdf | title = Pickering B Refurbishment Project Questions and Answers | work = Pickering B Refurbishment Project Questions and Answers by Ontario Power Generation | accessdate=  2008-12-15 }}</ref>) In 2005, the successor [[Ontario Power Generation]] announced that Units 2 and 3 would not be refurbished, contrary to expectations. Their condition - especially the steam generators - was much poorer than Units 1 and 4, making refurbishment uneconomical. They were put in long term storage mode, defuelled and drained, in 2010.

The second multi-unit, [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], was constructed in stages between 1970 and 1987. It is the largest nuclear facility in North America, and second largest in the world (after [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki-Kariwa]] in Japan), with eight [[nuclear reactor|reactors]] at around 800 MWe each, in total 6,232&nbsp;MW (net) and 7,276&nbsp;MW (gross). Current output with six of the eight reactors on line is 4,640&nbsp;MW.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/Page.asp?PageID=122&ContentID=5363&SiteNodeID=305&BL_ExpandID= |title=The Need for More Transmission in Bruce Region |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=Ontario Power Authority}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> Restart of the remaining two units is planned by 2012.

==Economics==
The neutron economy of heavy water moderation and precise control of on-line refueling allow CANDU to use a great range of fuels other than enriched uranium, e.g. natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], and used LWR fuel. Given the expense of enrichment, this can make fuel much cheaper. There is however an initial investment into the tonnes of 99.75% pure<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e|title=Canadian Nuclear FAQ|work=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock|accessdate=March 5, 2005}} [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionA.htm#e A. CANDU Nuclear Power Technology A.3 What is "heavy water"?] ''"reactor-grade" heavy water, nominally 99.75 wt% deuterium content.''</ref> heavy water to fill the core and heat transfer system.

Since heavy water is less efficient at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator to fuel ratio and a larger core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases cost for standard features like the [[containment building]]. The next generation [[Advanced CANDU Reactor]] (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator. Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are ~65% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only ~10% of the total, so the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable.

When first introduced, CANDUs offered much better [[capacity factor]] (ratio of power generated to what would be generated by running at full power, 100% of the time) than LWRs of a similar generation. The light-water designs spent, on average, about half the time being refueled or maintained. However, since the 1980s dramatic improvements in LWR outage management have narrowed the gap, with several units achieving capacity factors ~90% and higher, with an overall fleet performance of 89.5% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.nei.org/documents/U.S.%20Nuclear%20Industry%20is%20Achieving%20Record%20Levels%20of%20Performance.pdf US Fleet Performance] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> The latest-generation CANDU 6 reactors have a 88-90% CF, but overall performance is dominated by the older Canadian units with CFs on the order of 80%.<ref>[http://www.cns-snc.ca/branches/Toronto/energy/wind_vs_nuclear.doc CANDU Lifetime Performance to November 30, 2001]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

Some CANDU plants suffered from cost overruns during construction, mainly from external factors. For instance, a number of imposed construction delays led to roughly a doubling of the cost of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario. Technical problems and redesigns added about another billion to the resulting $14.4 billion price.<ref>[http://www.canducanada.ca/eng/darlington.html Team CANDU, Debunking Darlington] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.magma.ca/~jalrober/CANcosts.htm "Can CANDU estimates be trusted?"] by J.A.L. Robertson (2004)</ref> In contrast, more recently two CANDU 6 reactors at Qinshan in China were completed on-schedule and on-budget, an achievement attributed to tight control over scope and schedule.<ref>[http://canteach.candu.org/library/20031701.pdf Qinshan CANDU Project Construction Experiences]</ref>

== Nuclear nonproliferation ==
In terms of safeguards against nuclear weapons [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]], CANDUs meet a similar level of international certification as other reactors. There is a common misconception that plutonium for India's first nuclear detonation, [[Operation Smiling Buddha]] in 1974, was produced in a CANDU design. In fact, it was produced in the unsafeguarded Canada-supplied [[CIRUS]] reactor whose design is based on the [[NRX]], a Canadian research reactor. In addition to its two CANDU reactors, India has some unsafeguarded [[pressurised heavy water reactor]]s (PHWRs) based on the CANDU design, and two safeguarded light-water reactors supplied by the US. Plutonium has been extracted from the spent fuel from all of these reactors;<ref>{{cite journal

Although heavy water is relatively immune to neutron capture, a small amount of the deuterium turns into [[tritium]] in this way. Tritium+deuterium mix undergoes [[nuclear fusion]] more easily than any other substance. Tritium can be used in both the "fusion boost" of a [[boosted fission weapon]] and the main fusion process of an [[H-bomb]]. However, in an H-bomb, it's usually created ''in situ'' by neutron irradiation of [[Isotopes of lithium#Lithium-6|lithium-6]].

Tritium is extracted from some CANDU plants in Canada, mainly to improve safety in case of heavy-water leakage. The gas is stockpiled and used in a variety of commercial products, notably [[Self-powered lighting|"powerless" lighting systems]] and medical devices. In 1985 what was then Ontario Hydro sparked controversy in Ontario due to its plans to sell tritium to the U.S.  The plan, by law, involved sales to non-military applications only, but some speculated that the exports could have freed American tritium for the U.S. nuclear weapons program. Future demands appear to outstrip production, in particular the demands of future generations of experimental [[fusion reactor]]s like [[ITER]]. Currently between 1.5 and 2.1&nbsp;kg of tritium are recovered yearly at the Darlington separation facility, of which a minor fraction is sold.<ref>[http://public.lanl.gov/willms/Presentations/Tritium_Supply_Considerations.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}  {{Wayback|url=http://public.lanl.gov/willms/Presentations/Tritium_Supply_Considerations.pdf|date =20041224152735}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

The 1998 [[Operation Shakti]] test series in India included one bomb of about 45 kT yield that India has publicly claimed was a hydrogen bomb. An offhand comment in the [[BARC]] publication ''Heavy Water&nbsp;<U+2014> Properties, Production and Analysis'' appears to suggest that the tritium was extracted from the heavy water in the CANDU and PHWR reactors in commercial operation. ''Janes Intelligence Review'' quotes the Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission as admitting to the tritium extraction plant, but refusing to comment on its use.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ccnr.org/india_tritium.html | author =  Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility | title = Tritium from Power Plants gives India an H-bomb capability | date = 1996-03-27}}</ref> However India is also capable of creating tritium more efficiently by irradiation of lithium-6 in reactors.

==Active CANDU reactors==
Today there are 29 CANDU reactors in use around the world, and  13 "CANDU-derivatives" in India, developed from the CANDU design after India detonated a nuclear bomb in 1974 and Canada stopped nuclear dealings with India. The breakdown is:
* [[Canada]]: 17 (+3 refurbishing, +5 decommissioned)
* [[South Korea]]: 4
* [[China]]: 2
* [[India]]: 2 (+13 CANDU-derivatives in use, +3 CANDU-derivatives under construction)
* [[Argentina]]: 1
* [[Romania]]: 2 (+3 under construction, currently dormant)
* [[Pakistan]]: 1

==New plants==
Interest continues in new CANDU construction around the world, and CANDU is competing in open bids alongside LWR technology.

Two new CANDU reactors have been proposed in [[Ontario]], Canada, a province that currently generates over 50% of its electricity from CANDU reactors, with Canadian government help with financing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0743618220080807?sp=true|title=Canada nuclear firms seek Ottawa financing|date=August 7, 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-08-10 | first=David | last=Ljunggren}}</ref> Interest has also been expressed in [[Western Canada]], where CANDU reactors are being considered as heat and electricity sources for the energy-intensive [[tar sands|oil sands]] extraction process, which currently uses [[natural gas]]. [[Energy Alberta Corporation]] announced August 27, 2007 that they had applied for a licence to build a new nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30&nbsp;km west of the town of [[Peace River, Alberta]]), two [[AECL]] ACR-1000 reactors going online in 2017 producing 2.2 [[gigawatt]] (electric).<ref>[http://www.albertaindex.com/content/view/213/1/ Lac Cardinal (Alberta Index)]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/08/28/alberta-nuclear.html Lac Cardinal (CBC) 2007-08-28]</ref><ref>[http://www.thehilltimes.ca/pdf/2007/060407_ht.pdf ''The Hill Times'' page 26, 2007-06-04]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

[[Romania]] is in discussions for the completion of its nuclear plant at [[Cernavod<U+0103> Nuclear Power Plant|Cernavod<U+0103>]] (two reactors built in 1996 and 2007 and three more unfinished). The project was interrupted at the close of the [[Nicolae Ceau<U+0219>escu]] regime.

[[Turkey]] has repeatedly shown interest in the CANDU reactor, but currently plans to build reactors of a different type.<ref>[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/8488525 Turkey's nuclear future]</ref> There have been anti-nuclear protests in the past, e.g. in April 2006 plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Ince peninsula caused a large anti-nuclear demonstration in the Turkish city of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]].<ref>From http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?47326-Thousands-protest-Turkey-s-plans-to-build-nuclear-power-plant (retrieved 2010-11-08, 0410 UTC).</ref><ref>From http://energynewsletterturkey.blogspot.com/2006_04_01_archive.html (retrieved 2010-11-08, 0410 UTC).</ref> Despite opposition, Turkey aims to have five nuclear power plants by 2030.<ref>[http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/8488525 Turkey's nuclear future]</ref>

===Enhanced CANDU 6===
The Enhanced CANDU 6 is an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU 6 design with a gross output of 740 MWe per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over fifty years, with a mid-life program to replace some of the key components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual [[capacity factor]] is more than ninety percent. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs.

Enhancements include an ultrasonic flow meter (UFM) to improve the accuracy of feedwater flow measurements, improvements in turbine design and changes in the condenser vacuum system for operation at lower condenser pressures. Other features continue to be developed. The main improvements over CANDU 6 are:

* increased plant margins, both [[operating margin|operational profit]] and safety
* faster project completion
* enhanced environmental protection
* improved severe accident response
* improved fire protection system
* improved plant security
* modern computers and control systems, advanced control room design
* improved operability and maintainability
* optimized maintenance outages
* advanced MACSTOR facility for spent fuel storage
* operation at 50%-100% of full power, following electricity demand

===Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR-1000)===
{{Main|Advanced CANDU Reactor}}
ACR-1000 is the next-generation (officially, "Generation III+") CANDU technology which makes some significant modifications to the existing CANDU design. It is expected that capital cost will be up to 40% lower than current CANDU 6 plants. Its main advantages are:

* longer lifetime (60 years)
* longer operating cycles between maintenance outages (3 years)
* 90% design capacity factor
* pre-stressed concrete containment (1.8&nbsp;m thick) with steel liner
* further additions to CANDU's inherent passive safety
* compact fuel-channel design, generating over 50% more power with similar core diameter, average channel power increased from ~6 MW to ~7 MW
* improved efficiency through higher-temperature and pressure steam turbines (13 MPa primary pressure and 7 MPa outlet pressure, vs. around 10 MPa and 5 MPa in current designs)
* light-water coolant, with negative [[void coefficient|void reactivity]] and no tritium production in coolant
* [[enriched uranium#slightly enriched uranium|slightly enriched uranium]] fuel (1-2%), extending fuel life so that only a third as much used fuel is produced
* heavy water use reduced to only a third for the same power output, reducing cost
* flatter neutron flux shape, allowing 14% lower heat production in the hottest fuel elements

In both EC6 and ACR-1000 the defining features of CANDU are all maintained:

* modular, horizontal fuel channel core
* heavy water moderation
* simple, cheap fuel bundle
* separate, cool, low-pressure moderator with back-up heat sink capability
* two independent, fast-acting shutdown systems
* on-power refuelling, allowing easier long-term neutron flux shaping and dealing with damaged fuel bundles

In 2007 AECL submitted the ACR-1000 design to the British Generic Design Assessment process to evaluate reactors for a new British nuclear power station program. However in 2008 AECL withdrew the design, stating it "is focusing its marketing and licensing resources for the advanced Candu reactor on the immediate needs of the Canadian domestic marketplace."<ref name=cbc-20080404>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/04/04/aecl-britain.html|title=AECL bows out of British reactor development to focus on Canadian projects|date=April 4, 2008|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>

==Tritium emissions==
[[Tritium]] is a radioactive form of [[hydrogen]] (H-3), with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. It is found in small amounts in nature (about 4&nbsp;kg globally), created by [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the upper atmosphere. Tritium is considered a weak [[radionuclide]] because of its low-energy radioactive emissions ([[beta particle]] energy 0 -19 keV).<ref>[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/ReviewofGreenpeacereport_Final.pdf reviewed by Dr. Richard Osborne]</ref> The beta particles do not travel very far in air and do not penetrate skin, so the main hazard is intake into the body (inhalation, ingestion, or absorption).

Tritium is generated in the fuel of all reactors; however, CANDU reactors generate tritium also in their coolant and moderator, due to [[neutron capture]] in heavy hydrogen.  Some of this tritium escapes into containment and is generally recovered; however a small percentage (about 1%) escapes containment and is considered a routine radioactive emission (also higher than from an LWR of comparable size). Operating a CANDU plant therefore includes monitoring tritium in the surrounding environment (and publishing the results).

In some CANDU reactors the tritium is periodically extracted.  Typical emissions from CANDU plants in Canada are less than 1% of the national regulatory limit, which is based on [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opg.com/safety/nsafe/nuclear/faq.asp |title=Ontario Power Generation: Safety |publisher=Opg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> (for example, the maximum permitted drinking water concentration for tritium in Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/water-eau/drink-potab/guide/index-eng.php |title=Canadian Drinking Water Guidelines |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> 7000 Bq/L, corresponds to 1/10 of the ICRP's dose limit for members of the public).  Tritium emissions from other CANDU plants are similarly low.<ref>http://www.djs.si/proc/port2001/pdf/508.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nirs.org/radiation/tritium/tritium06122007gphazardreport.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Tritiumstudyfinal-11-06-07.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>

In general there is significant public controversy about radioactive emissions from nuclear power plants, and for CANDU plants one of the main concerns is tritium.   In 2007 [[Greenpeace]] published a [http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/canada/en/documents-and-links/publications/tritium-hazard-report-pollu.pdf critique of tritium emissions] from Canadian nuclear power plants by Dr. Ian Fairlie.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccatoxicwaste.org/rad2.htm |title=Dr Ian Fairlie |publisher=www.ccatoxicwaste.org |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}</ref>  This report was [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/ReviewofGreenpeacereport_Final.pdf criticized by Dr. Richard Osborne].<ref>http://www.cna.ca/english/pdf/Studies/BioDr-Richard_Osborne.pdf</ref>
