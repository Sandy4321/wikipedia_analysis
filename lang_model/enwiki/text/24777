'''Palygorskite''' or '''attapulgite''' is a [[magnesium]] [[aluminium]] [[Silicate minerals|phyllosilicate]] with formula (Mg,[[aluminum|Al]])<sub>2</sub>[[silicon|Si]]<sub>4</sub>[[oxygen|O]]<sub>10</sub>(O[[hydrogen|H]])<U+00B7>4([[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]) which occurs in a type of [[clay]] [[soil]] common to the [[Southeastern United States]].  It is one of the types of [[fuller's earth]].

==Name==
The name ''attapulgite'' is derived from the U.S. town of [[Attapulgus, Georgia]], in the extreme southwest corner of the state, where the mineral is abundant. It is [[surface mining|surface-mined]] in the area, dry-ground and air-separated into precise particle sizes, and transported in [[covered hopper]] cars via the [[railroad]], and is also shipped in {{convert|50|lb|kg}} [[paper bag]]s and bulk bags by [[truck]]. 

The name ''palygorskite'' is given after the place in the [[Ural Mountains]] where it was discovered.

==Prehistoric use==
Palygorskite is known to have been a key constituent of the [[pigment]] called "[[Maya Blue]]", which was used notably by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]] on ceramics, sculptures, murals and (most probably) [[Maya textiles]]. The clay mineral was also used by the Maya as a curative for certain illnesses, and there is evidence to show it was also added to pottery temper. A Maya region source for palygorskite was unknown until the 1960s, when one was found at a ''[[cenote]]'' on the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] near the modern township of [[Sacalum]], [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]]. A second possible site was more recently (2005) identified, near [[Ticul]], [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]].<ref>See abstract of Arnold (2005).</ref>

The Maya Blue pigment synthetic was also manufactured in other Mesoamerican regions and used by other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the [[Aztec]]s of central Mexico. The blue coloration seen on [[Maya codices|Maya]] and [[Aztec codices]], and early colonial-era manuscripts and maps, is largely produced by the organic-inorganic mixture of [[a<U+00F1>il]] leaves and palygorskite, with smaller amounts of other mineral additives.<ref>Haude (1997).</ref> Human sacrificial victims in Postclassic Mesoamerica were frequently daubed with this blue pigmentation.<ref>Arnold and Bohor (1975), as cited in Haude (1997).</ref>

==Extraction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Two companies are involved in the industrial extraction and processing of gellant grade attapulgite clay within the same Attapulgus deposit: Active Minerals International, LLC, and BASF Corp. In 2008, BASF acquired the assets of Zemex Attapulgite leaving only 2 gellant grade producers.  Active Minerals operates a dedicated factory to produce the patented product Actigel 208 and built a new state of the art production process in early 2009 involving portable plant processing at the mine site.

==Properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
Attapulgite clays are a composite of smectite and palygorskite.  Smectites are expanding lattice clays of which bentonite is a commonly known generic name for smectite clays.  The palygorskite component is an acicular bristle-like crystalline form which does not swell or expand. Attapulgite forms gel structures in fresh and salt water by establishing a lattice structure of particles connected through hydrogen bonds. Attapulgite, unlike bentonite, will form gel structures in salt water and is used in special salt water drilling mud for drilling formations contaminated with salt. Palygorskite particles can be considered as charged particles with zones of + and - charges. It is the bonding of these alternating charges that allow them to form gel suspensions in salt and fresh water. 

Attapulgite clays found in the Meigs-Quincy district are bundles of palygorskite clay particles between 2 and 3 micrometres long and below 3 nanometres in diameter. The bundles are surrounded by a matrix of smectite clays which are slightly swellable.   Dry process grades contain up to 25% non-attapulgite material in the form of carbonates and other mineral inclusions. Processing of the clays consist of drying and grinding the crude clay to specific particle size distributions with specific ranges of gel viscosity measured by a variety of means depending on the end use.

Gel grade, dry processed attapulgites are used in a very wide range of applications for suspension, reinforcement and binding properties.  Paints, sealants, adhesives, tape-joint compound, catalysts, suspension fertilizers, wild fire suppressants, foundry coatings, animal feed suspensions and molecular sieve binders are just a few uses of dry process attapulgite.

Actigel 208 is a patented, purified form of attapulgite where the clay has been chemically and mechanically exfoliated into discrete particles of palygorskite which are 2 micrometres in length and 3 nanometres in diameter nano-particles. All non-palygorskite particles are removed leaving the purified form of palygorskite.  This material is capable of performing rheology modification and particle suspension of high solids slurries in a wide variety of mineral applications such as ceramics, catalyst, concrete, sealants, adhesives and plastics.  It acts as a very high temperature binder for materials that are historically very difficult to bind such as activated carbon, silicon carbide and calcined aluminas.  Acti-gel 208 is a low cost nano particle when compared to other nano-clays.

Seven to ten percent attapulgite clay mixed with the eutectic salt, [[sodium sulfate]] decahydrate (Glaubers salt), will keep [[anhydrous]] [[crystal]]s suspended in the solution where they will hydrate during [[phase change]] and hence contribute to the heat absorbed and released when Glaubers salt are used for heat storage.

==Medical use==
Attapulgite is used widely in [[medicine]]. Taken by mouth, it physically binds to [[acid]]s and [[toxic]] substances in the [[stomach]] and [[digestive tract]]. Also, as an [[anti-diarrheal]], it is believed to work by adsorbing the bacteria or germ that may be causing the diarrhea. For this reason, it has been used in several anti-diarrheal medications, including [[Diar-Aid]], [[Diarrest]], [[Diasorb]], [[Diatabs]], [[Diatrol]], [[Donnagel]], [[Kaopek]], [[K-Pek]], [[Parepectolin]], and [[Rheaban]].<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/cons/diasorb.html Information from Drugs.com]</ref>

Until 2003, [[Kaopectate]] marketed in the US also contained attapulgite. However, at that time, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] retroactively rejected [[medical studies]] showing its [[efficacy]], calling them insufficient despite its decades of use. Kaopectate's U.S. [[formula]] was changed to [[bismuth subsalicylate]] (pink bismuth). The next year (2004), an additional change in labelling was made; from then on, Kaopectate was no longer recommended for children under 12 years old.<ref>FDA Patient Safety News: October 2004. [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/psn/printer.cfm?id=265 Kaopectate Reformulation Causes Confusion]</ref> Nevertheless, Kaopectate with attapulgite is still available in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. Until the early 1990s, Kaopectate used the similar clay product [[kaolinite]] with [[pectin]] (hence the name).
