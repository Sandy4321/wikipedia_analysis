Following the release of [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|the first ''Harry Potter'' movie]], attending school became hard, with some students becoming hostile. Radcliffe said it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.<ref name="details07">{{cite web |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/cover-stars/200706/meet-the-new-grown-up-harry-potter-star-daniel-radcliffe?currentPage=2 |title=DANIEL RADCLIFFE |first=Simon |last=Garfield |work=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |page=2 |publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]] |date=June 2007 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref> As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors.

The release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (released as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the United States) took place in 2001. The story follows Harry, a young boy who learns he is a [[wizard]] and is sent to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to begin his magical education.

A year later, Radcliffe starred in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', the second installment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarized opinions on the movie as a whole. Stephen Hunter of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' labeled it "big, dull and empty", whereas Desson Thomson of the same publication had more positive feelings.<ref name="rtscore"/> Observing that Radcliffe and his peers had matured, ''Los Angeles Times'''s staff writer Kenneth Turan believed the novel's magic could not be successfully duplicated in the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051228225730/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story |archivedate=28 December 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2007 |date=15 November 2002 |author=Kenneth Turan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> Nonetheless, it still managed to earn US$878 million, taking the second spot of the highest-grossing 2002 films worldwide behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2002&p=.htm |title=2002 WORLDWIDE GROSSES |publisher=IMDb Inc |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>

The 2004 release ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' marked the third in the series. While garnering the highest critical acclaim of the series<ref name="rtscore"/> and grossing US$795.6 million worldwide, the film's performance at the box office ranks the lowest in the series.<ref name="thenumbersbo"/> Meanwhile, Radcliffe's performance was panned by critics, who found him to be "wooden", with ''New York Times'' journalist [[A.

The film explored romantic elements, included more humor and saw Harry selected as a competitor in a dangerous multi-wizard school competition. ''Goblet of Fire'' set records for a ''Harry Potter'' opening weekend, as well as for a non-May opening weekend in the US and an opening weekend in the UK. In a 2005 interview, Radcliffe singled out the humor as being a reason for the movie's creative success.<ref name="ignin">{{cite web |title=Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/667/667146p2.html|date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |publisher=News Corporation |work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

Despite the success of the past movies, the future of the franchise was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes. However, by 2 March 2007, Radcliffe signed for the final films, which put an end to weeks of press speculation that he would be denied the part due to his involvement in ''Equus''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1553722/20070302/story.jhtml |title=Harry Potter Will Be Played By Daniel Radcliffe In Final Two Flicks |date=2 March 2007 |publisher=[[Viacom]] |work=[[MTV]] |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> Radcliffe reprised his role for the fifth time in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' (2007), which details Harry's return to Hogwarts after his recent encounter with Lord Voldemort.
