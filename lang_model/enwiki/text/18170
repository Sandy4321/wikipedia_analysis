{{campaignbox Texas Revolution}}
The '''Battle of Goliad''' was the second skirmish of the [[Texas Revolution]].  In the early-morning hours of October 10, 1835, rebellious Texas settlers attacked the [[Mexican Army]] soldiers garrisoned at [[Presidio La Bah<U+00ED>a]], a fort near the [[Mexican Texas]] settlement of [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]]. La Bah<U+00ED>a lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers (at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar]]) and the major Texas port of [[Copano, Texas|Copano]].

In September, [[Texian]]s began plotting to kidnap Mexican General [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]], who was en route to Goliad to attempt to quell the unrest in Texas.  The plan was initially dismissed by the central committee coordinating the rebellion. However, within days of the Texian victory at the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Captain George Collingsworth and members of the Texian militia in [[Matagorda, Texas|Matagorda]] began marching towards Goliad. The Texians soon learned that Cos and his men had already departed for San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar but continued their march.

The garrison at La Bah<U+00ED>a was understaffed and could not mount an effective defense of the fort's perimeter.  Using axes borrowed from townspeople, Texians were able to chop through a door and enter the complex before the bulk of the soldiers were aware of their presence.  After a 30-minute battle, the Mexican garrison, under Colonel Juan L<U+00F3>pez Sandoval, surrendered. One Mexican soldier had been killed and three others wounded, while only one Texian had been injured. The majority of the Mexican soldiers were instructed to leave Texas, and the Texians confiscated $10,000 worth of provisions and several cannons, which they soon transported to the [[Texian Army]] for use in the [[Siege of Bexar|Siege of B<U+00E9>xar]]. The victory isolated Cos's men in B<U+00E9>xar from the coast, forcing them to rely on a long overland march to request or receive reinforcements or supplies.

==Background==
{{Main|Texas Revolution}}
In 1835, Mexico operated two major garrisons within [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], the [[Alamo Mission|Alamo]] at [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar]] and [[Presidio La Bah<U+00ED>a]] near [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].<ref name=scott19/> B<U+00E9>xar was the political center of Texas, and Goliad lay halfway between it and the major Texas port of [[Copano, Texas|Copano]]. Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to Copano Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements.<ref name=scott18/>

In early 1835, as the Mexican government transitioned from a [[federalism|federalist]] model to [[centralized government|centralism]], wary colonists in Texas began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe de Austin]] coordinated their activities.<ref name=huson4>Huson (1974), p. 4.</ref> The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June; these [[Anahuac Disturbances]] prompted Mexican President [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] to send additional troops to Texas.<ref name=roell36>Roell (1994), p. 36.</ref> In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle led 200&nbsp;men to reinforce Presidio La Bah<U+00ED>a. The following month, a contingent of soldiers arrived in B<U+00E9>xar with Colonel [[Domingo de Ugartechea]].<ref name=huson5>Huson (1974), p. 5.</ref> Fearing that stronger measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]] to "repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, are pushing forward with a desire to live at their own option without subjection to the laws".<ref name=roell36/><ref name=handbook/> Cos landed at Copano Bay on September 20 with approximately 500&nbsp;soldiers.<ref name=huson5/> Cos briefly toured the port at Copano Bay and the small garrison at nearby [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]] and left small groups of soldiers to reinforce each of these locations.<ref name=huson7>Huson (1974), p. 7.</ref> The main body of soldiers arrived in Goliad on October 2.<ref name=handbook/>

Unbeknownst to Cos, as early as September 18, several Texians, including [[James Fannin]], [[Philip Dimmitt]], and John Linn, had independently begun advocating a plan to seize Cos at either Copano or Goliad.<ref name=handbook/> As soon as Cos's warships were spotted approaching Copano Bay, Refugio colonists sent messengers to San Felipe de Austin and [[Matagorda, Texas|Matagorda]] to inform the other settlements of Cos's imminent arrival. Concerned that a lack of artillery would make the presidio at Goliad impossible to capture, the central committee chose not to order an assault.<ref name=huson8>Huson (1974), p. 8.</ref>

Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn continued to push for an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]], where a small group of Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the [[Battle of Gonzales]] officially opened the [[Texas Revolution]]. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for B<U+00E9>xar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bah<U+00ED>a.<ref name=handbook>{{citation|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|title=Goliad Campaign of 1835|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/GG/qdg1.html|accessdate=2008-07-14|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]}}</ref>

==Prelude==
On October 6, members of the Texian militia in Matagorda convened at the home of Sylvanus Hatch. As their first order of business they elected George Collingsworth as their captain; Dr. William Carleton was then named first lieutenant and D.C. Collingsworth became the unit's second lieutenant. After appointing their leaders, the men decided to march on La Bah<U+00ED>a. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him.<ref name=hardin14>Hardin (1994), p. 14.</ref>  The Texians sent messengers to alert nearby settlements of their quest. By afternoon, 50&nbsp;Texians were ready to march from Matagorda.<ref name=hardin14/><ref name=scott18>Scott (2000), p. 18.</ref> During the march, for unknown reasons the men fired Carleton and appointed James W. Moore as the new first lieutenant.<ref name=hardin14/>

The following day the expedition stopped at [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]], where they were soon joined by English-speaking settlers from other settlements and 30&nbsp;[[Tejano]]s. Although no accurate muster rolls were kept, historian Stephen Hardin estimated that the Texian ranks swelled to 125&nbsp;men. Forty-nine of them signed a "Compact of Volunteers under Collingsworth" on October 9. These men pledged that they were loyal to the Mexican federal government and would harm no one who remained loyal to the federalist cause.<ref name=hardin15>Hardin (1994), p. 15.</ref>
[[Image:TXMap-doton-Goliad.PNG|thumb|right|This map marks the location of [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]] in Texas. The battle took place near the town.]]
One of the new arrivals, merchant Philip Dimmitt, received a missive from the Goliad customs agent with news that Cos and his war chest had already departed La Bah<U+00ED>a to travel to San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar.<ref name=huson11>Huson (1974), p. 11.</ref> Undeterred, the group marched out on October 9.<ref name=hardin15/> [[Ira Ingram]] led the vanguard, which halted {{convert|1|mi|km}} outside Goliad.<ref name=huson14>Huson (1974), p. 14.</ref> The events that follow are not very clear. According to the memoirs of Mexican General [[Vicente Filisola]], who was not in Texas in 1835, the Texians plotted to draw the presidio commander, Colonel Juan L<U+00F3>pez Sandoval, and his officers from the fort. The Texians allegedly planned a dance in Goliad on October 9 and invited the Mexican officers. Although Sandoval, Captain Manuel Sabriego, and Lieutenant Jesus de la Garza briefly attended the dance, they suspected mischief and returned to the fort.<ref name=huson15>Huson (1994), p. 15.</ref> No Texian source mentions such a plot. Several of the Texians, including Dimmitt, did enter the town that evening to try to find guides and support for the effort.<ref name=huson14/> Dimmitt's efforts were successful, and several of the Tejanos who lived near Goliad joined the Texian force. They reported that Sandoval commanded only 50&nbsp;men&mdash;far fewer than the number necessary to defend the entire perimeter of the fort&mdash;and provided directions to the fort.<ref name=hardin15/><ref name=hardin16>Hardin (1994), p. 16.</ref><ref name=scott19>Scott (2000), p. 19.</ref>

The main body of Texian soldiers, under Collingsworth, became disoriented in the dark and wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a [[mesquite]] thicket. While working their way back towards the road, the Texians met [[Ben Milam]], a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in [[Monterrey]]. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.<ref name=hardin16/>

==Battle==
As the combined Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the ''[[alcade]]''<ref>An ''alcade'' is roughly equivalent to a mayor.</ref> of the city to surrender. At 11&nbsp;pm, the ''alcade'' responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia.<ref name=hardin16/> The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio.<ref name=huson16>Huson (1974), p. 16.</ref> In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked.<ref name=hardin16/> The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead.<ref name=huson16/> The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.<ref name=scott20>Scott (2000), p. 20.</ref>

The Mexican soldiers opened fire, hitting Samuel McCulloch, a slave whom George Collingsworth had freed, in the shoulder.<ref name=hardin16/> Texians returned fire for approximately 30&nbsp;minutes. During a pause in the fighting, a Texian spokesperson yelled out that the Texians would "massacre everyone of you, unless you come out immediately and surrender".<ref name=hardin17>Hardin (1994), p. 17.</ref> The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered.<ref name=hardin17/>

==Aftermath==
McCulloch was the only Texian soldier to be wounded, and he later claimed to be the "first whose blood was shed in the Texas War for Independence".<ref name=scott21>Scott (2000), p. 21.</ref> This distinction earned him a permanent home; a later law prohibited any freed slave from residing in the [[Republic of Texas]], but in 1840 the Texas legislature specifically excluded McCulloch, his family, and his descendants from its enforcement. The exclusion was a reward for McCulloch's service and his injury.<ref name=huson13>Huson (1974), p. 13.</ref>

Estimates of Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded.<ref name=handbook/><ref name=scott20/> Approximately 20&nbsp;soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]] of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitl<U+00E1>n.<ref name=handbook/> Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]], where the newly formed [[Texian Army]] was located.<ref name=hardin17/><ref name=roell40>Roell (1994), p. 40.</ref> The Texian Army commander, [[Stephen F. Austin]], later released all of the men, on the condition that they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents.<ref name=scott20/> One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman.<ref name=hardin17/> In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.<ref name=handbook/>

Texian troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort. Although they found 300&nbsp;muskets, most of them were broken and unable to be repaired.<ref name=hardin17/><ref name=scott20/> Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths who were able to bring the remaining weapons into service.<ref name=huson18>Huson (1974), p. 18.</ref> The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at [[USD|$]]10,000.<ref name=scott20/><!--pesos and US dollars were roughly equivalent in this time frame--> The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175&nbsp;barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, whiskey, and rum.<ref name=huson18/> For the next three months, the provisions were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army.<ref name=handbook/> The Texians also gained control of several cannons.<ref name=scott21/>

Over the next several days, more Texian settlers joined the group at La Bah<U+00ED>a. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack.<ref name=huson17>Huson (1974), p. 17.</ref> Austin ordered that 100&nbsp;men remain at Goliad, under the command of Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in B<U+00E9>xar. Collingsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards B<U+00E9>xar.<ref name=handbook/>

The loss of Goliad meant that Cos lost his means of communicating with Copano Bay, the closest port to B<U+00E9>xar.<ref name=hardin17/> The Mexican troops garrisoned at B<U+00E9>xar would now need to get supplies and reinforcements overland.<ref name=hardin19>Hardin (1994), p. 19.</ref>
