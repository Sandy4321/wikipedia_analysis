'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry''' (JTWC designation: '''17P''') was a [[tropical cyclone]] that made landfall in [[Australia]] during the [[2005-06 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season]]. Larry originated as a low pressure system over the eastern [[Coral Sea]] on [[March 16]] and was monitored by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] in [[Brisbane, Australia]]. The low-pressure area formed into a tropical cyclone two days later and quickly strengthened into a Category 5 storm on the [[Tropical cyclone scales#South Pacific|Australian tropical cyclone scale]]. Larry made landfall in [[Far North Queensland]] close to [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]] on [[March 20]] as a Category 4 with wind gusts reaching 240 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (150 [[miles per hour|mph]]) and dissipated over land soon after. The total effects of Larry were nearly A$1 billion in damage and one fatality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/banana-prices-to-double-after-crop-devastation/2006/03/21/1142703331184.html|title=Banana prices to double after crop devastation|accessdate=2006-03-25}}</ref>

== Storm history == 
{{storm path|Larry 2006 track.png}}
Larry began as a low pressure system over the eastern Coral Sea that was monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology from 16 March. It formed into a tropical cyclone 1150 kilometres (730 miles) off the coast of [[Queensland]], Australia on Saturday [[March 18]], [[2006]]. Larry was a Category 2 cyclone in the [[Tropical cyclone classification schemes#Categories and ranking|Australian intensity scale]] when the cyclone watch commenced, and gradually intensified to Category 5 on that scale. The eye of Larry crossed the coast near Innisfail between 6:20am and 7:20am AEST on 20th March. According to the preliminary data, the winds near Innisfail may have reached 290 km/h with gusts to 310-320 km/h. However, a reanalysis indicated based on land observations that Cyclone Larry was a Category 4 cyclone during landfall, as wind gusts were estimated to have reached 240 km/h in the area of impact.<ref> http://www.webcitation.org/5NWdEKGK9</ref> Apart from Ingrid, Larry is the first severe tropical cyclone to cross the Queensland east coast since Rona in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|title=Summary of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/qld/cyclone/tc_larry}}</ref> Queensland was later hit by another severe cyclone, [[Cyclone Monica|Monica]], only a month later.

The [[Tropical cyclone classification schemes#Categories and ranking|Australian intensity scale]] is based on maximum wind gusts, which are estimated to be 40 percent above 10-minute sustained winds. On this scale, Larry peaked as a Category 5 cyclone. The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]'s maximum 1-minute wind speed assigned to the cyclone would make it a Category 3 storm on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].

From an estimate of winds speeds needed to fail simple structures a damage survey of buildings in the Innisfail region estimated the peak gust wind speeds (referenced to flat open country at a height of 10 m) across the study area to range from 180 km/h to 230 km/h.  This estimate of peak winds in open terrain correlates with the Bureau of Meteorology<U+2019>s reanalysis of Cyclone Larry at landfall. Their reviews of data suggest that Larry was a Category 4 system when it crossed the coast.<ref> http://eng.jcu.edu.au/cts/newsletter/Oct_06_CTS_Newsletter.pdf</ref> It was confirmed by the Bureau of Meteorology in March 2007 that the cyclone did make landfall as a Category 4 cyclone.<ref> http://www.webcitation.org/5NWdEKGK9</ref>

[[Image:Mourilyan mill destruction.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The spectacular destruction of the [[Mourilyan]] sugar mill was an iconic image of the Cyclone's aftermath]]
A 10-minute average wind speed of 108 [[knot (speed)|knots]] (200&nbsp;[[km/h]], 125&nbsp;[[mph]]) was reported in [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]] during landfall.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|title=Latest Coastal Weather Observations for Innisfail|date=[[March 20]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-03-20|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ60701/IDQ60701.94291.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Above data archived-reproduced at Wunderground|title=History for Innisfail, Queensland on Monday, March 20, 2006|accessdate=2006-03-29|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/station/94291/2006/3/20/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA}}</ref> This theoretically corresponds to 125 knot 1-minute sustained winds, and maximum wind gusts too are generally consistent with a Saffir-Simpson scale Category 4 storm<ref>http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/faq/faq_def_2.shtml</ref>. (The cyclone's minimum pressure would be more consistent with Category 5 if this were an Atlantic hurricane). 

At 1 am AEST on [[March 21]], Larry was downgraded to a Tropical Low pressure system as it moved inland. Ex-tropical cyclone Larry was further tracked as it moved into western Queensland to the north of Mount Isa. Larry's short life as a cyclone is attributed to its speed; the system moved very quickly over the [[Coral Sea]] and dissipated soon after, spending nearly 24 hours of being over land.  Cyclone Larry is considered to be the worst cyclone to hit the coast of Queensland since 1931. Because of this, the name "Larry" was retired on the 12th of December, 2006.<ref>http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/warnings/cyclone_names.shtml</ref>

==Impact==

Predictions could not list the level of destruction, devastation and despair that [http://www.cairnsnewspapers.com.au/localnews/detail.asp?aid=203 Larry]   brought in its wake, the most powerful cyclone in almost a century. Roofs torn off houses, wrapped around teetering power poles with their jangled powerless lines draped across streets, fields flattened, crops destroyed, tourist destinations thrashed, wildlife nesting sites destroyed, institutions mangled, rows of construction mowed down in a few minutes by a howling banshee going at 300km/h.   "This is the most devastating cyclone that we could potentially see on the east coast of Queensland for decades ... there was great destruction," according to Queensland state Counter Disaster Rescue Services executive director Frank Pagano.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/03/19/cyclone.larry.ap/|title= Massive cyclone hits Australia|accessdate=2006-03-20}}</ref>

Premier of Queensland [[Peter Beattie]] declared Larry a disaster situation, comparing it to [[Cyclone Tracy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18531359-29279,00.html|title=Beattie fears cyclone's power|accessdate=2006-03-20}}</ref> and giving local governments the power to enforce mandatory evacuations. 

Australian [[Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] has said of Larry, "this cyclone is of an enormous magnitude" and reserved several [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] and [[CH-47 Chinook]] heavy lift helicopters for rescue efforts in the aftermath of the cyclone. He has also promised grants of $10,000 to businesses affected by the cyclone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18562824%255E12377,00.html|title= Government announces grants|accessdate=2006-03-22}}</ref>. 

An appeal fund has been launched by the Queensland Government with an initial donation of $100,000, with the [[Commonwealth Bank]] donating $50,000, and then increasing its donation to $1 Million after sighting the devastation. Premier Beattie asked "everyone to dig deep and help people who have suffered in the devastation wreaked by the cyclone"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18532292-29277,00.html|title=Cyclone appeal fund launched|accessdate=2006-03-20}}</ref>.

[[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] [[Cairns International Airport|airport]] and [[Cairns Port Authority|harbour]] were closed, and all flights were suspended. 
[[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]] suffered severe damage, being the town where Larry made landfall. [[Babinda, Queensland|Babinda]], 30 kilometres north of Innisfail, had reports of up to 80% of buildings damaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.news.com.au/story/0,20797,18548596-952,00.html|title= Larry's catastrophic toll|accessdate=2006-03-21}}</ref> The region's banana industry, which employs up to 6000 people, has also suffered extreme losses of crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18531510%255E31037,00.html|title= Cyclone 'to ruin farmers'|accessdate=2006-03-20}}</ref> These losses account for more than 80% of the total banana crop for Australia <ref>
http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=92100</ref> The [[Atherton Tablelands]] also received a great deal of damage from Cyclone Larry, with damage to buildings and major disruptions to power, water and telephone services.

Other towns to be damaged were Kurrimine Beach with 30% of homes damaged, Silkwood with 99% of homes damaged, and [[Mission Beach, Queensland|Mission Beach]] with 30% of homes damaged. [[Cairns]], the largest city closest to the cyclone, sustained minor damage. Mostly falling trees damaging homes and brought down power lines all over the city. Only minor structural damaged occurred in Cairns. Light aircraft were also flipped during the cyclone at Cairns Airport.

A damage survey of buildings in the Innisfail region [http://eng.jcu.edu.au/cts/newsletter/Oct_06_CTS_Newsletter.pdf] concluded that the majority of contemporary houses performed well structurally, that is the houses remained structurally intact with many roller doors being smashed to bits by the raging winds.  However, the report does note that these structures should have resisted Cyclone Larry's wind loads as the winds impacting the buildings were less than the building standard's regional design wind speed.  Older buildings and houses (built before introduction of tighter standards) suffered comparatively more damage.<ref> http://eng.jcu.edu.au/cts/newsletter/Oct_06_CTS_Newsletter.pdf</ref>

Preliminary reports estimate the cost of loss and damage to domestic and commercial premises is to be in excess of half a billion dollars. 

The remains of Tropical Cyclone Larry moved over north-western Queensland on 22-23 March, dumping heavy rain across the region. Gereta Station, north of [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]], recorded 583mm of rain in the 48 hours to 9am on [[March 23]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|title=Summary of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/qld/cyclone/tc_larry}}</ref> As a result of the rains, heavy flooding was reported along the Leichhardt River downstream, resulting in the inundation of some cattle properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/northwest/stories/s1601877.htm|title= Record breaking flood waters in the Gulf|accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref>

===Recovery Period===
The [[Governor General of Australia]], [[Michael Jeffery]], visited the area several days into the recovery, met with groups of people on the ground, and viewed the devastation from an Army helicopter. 

====Australian Defence Force====
Within a few hours of Larry's immediate effects ending, the [[Australian Defence Force]] dispatched elements of the [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] based [[Australian 3rd Brigade|3rd Brigade]] and the Cairns based [[Far North Queensland Regiment|51st Battalion]], Far North Queensland Regiment, [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] including: 6 [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters, 3 [[UH-1 Iroquois|Iroquois]] helicopters, 1 [[CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopter, 1 [[Sikorsky S-70|Seahawk]] helicopter, 3 Navy [[Balikpapan class LCH]] Landing Craft, 2 [[De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]] aircraft, 2 [[C-130 Hercules]], and several [[LARC-V]] amphibious 4WD vehicles. 

A Combat Services Support Battalion coordinated emergency support at Innisfail Showgrounds, providing health care, environmental advice, fresh food and purified water as well as testing local supplies, tarpaulins, bath and shower facilities, and up to 500 beds. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/NelsonMintpl.cfm?CurrentId=5503|title= Australian Troops Rebuilding Far North Queensland|accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref>

The Cowley Beach Training Area near [[Mourilyan, Queensland|Mourilyan Harbour]] some 25km south of Innisfail was significantly affected by Larry and its use as a base by recovery teams was therefore limited.

====Leadership by General Peter Cosgrove====
Recently retired Chief of Defence Force, General [[Peter Cosgrove]], agreed to head the recovery efforts, and was directing efforts from Innisfail by 24 March. 

Among his first activities was a call for an economic assessment of the effects by the Governments of [[Government of Queensland|Queensland]] and [[Government of Australia|Australia]], and a [[moratorium]] on businesses' debt repayments by banks for 3 months. 

====Tradesmen and prisoners====
A group of around 150 tradesmen from around Australia arrived in Innisfail around 26 March. These people worked to reopen the schools and other public buildings and reinstate and make habitable private dwellings. 

The Queensland Government was also determining how many trusted prisoners could be organised for work-gangs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1601405.htm|title= Shops reopen, trains running again in Innisfail|accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref> 

====Accommodation====
The media reported that rental agents were working to find accommodation for displaced persons. An already tight accommodation market had been exacerbated by the severe damage done to homes in the affected areas. Many tenants and owners of severely damaged homes had almost no chance of getting accommodation in the area. As such, many people were expected to move to Cairns for at least several months. 

This caused speculation that many young families would move from the region permanently, causing a hollowing out of the current demography of the region. This could make it difficult for local businesses to recruit new workers for many decades to come.

====Banana Shortage====
The cyclone destroyed 80 to 90% of Australia's banana crop.  Australia is relatively free of banana pests and diseases, and therefore does not allow bananas to be imported.  Bananas were in short supply and very expensive throughout Australia for the remainder of 2006 which increased prices across the country by 400-500%, with prices rising as high as $13-14/Kg.<ref>A.
