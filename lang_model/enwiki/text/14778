'''Tropical Storm Douglas''' was the fourth [[Tropical cyclone|named storm]] of the [[2008 Pacific hurricane season]]. Douglas developed out of a [[tropical wave]] which formed off the [[Africa|African]] coast on June&nbsp;19 and traversed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. On June&nbsp;27, the wave crossed [[Central America]] and entered the [[Pacific Ocean]]. On July&nbsp;1, the storm developed into Tropical Depression Four-E while located 245&nbsp;[[nautical miles|nmi]] (250&nbsp;[[Kilometer|km]]) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Mexico]] as it traveled to the northwest. Despite being dislocated from most of the convection by strong [[wind shear]], the depression gradually became better organized and on the afternoon July&nbsp;2, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Douglas. Upon the upgrade, Douglas reached its peak intensity of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km) 1003&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.63&nbsp;inHg). Douglas slowly weakened due to increasing shear and cooler waters and was downgraded to a tropical depression overnight on July&nbsp;3. The depression became devoid of convection shortly after and was further downgraded to a remnant low on the morning of July&nbsp;4 as it turned towards the west. The remnant low continued to weaken and completely dissipated on July&nbsp;6.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=Lixion A.

__TOC__
==Storm history==
{{storm path|Douglas 2008 track.png}}
A disorganized [[tropical wave]] exited the coast of [[Africa]] on June&nbsp;19. The wave remained poorly organized as it traversed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and entered the [[Pacific Ocean]] on June&nbsp;27. On June&nbsp;28, deep [[atmospheric convection|convection]] developed and a broad low-level circulation developed along the wave while located a few hundred miles south of  the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]]. The low traveled to the northwest and began to develop a well defined circulation. The low was upgraded to a tropical depression early on July&nbsp;1 while located 245&nbsp;[[nautical miles|nmi]] (250&nbsp;[[Kilometer|km]]) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Mexico]].<ref name="TCR"/><ref name="Disc. 1">{{cite web|author=Beven|title=Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion Number One|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The center of the depression was elongated as it entered an area of strong northeasterly [[wind shear]], also causing the low to become displaced to the north of the convection.<ref name="Disc. 1"/> Despite the shear, deep convection developed in developing bands in the south and western portions of the storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion Number Two|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> The depression continued to become better organized and on July&nbsp;2, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Douglas. However, the center of circulation remained located to the northeast of the deepest convection.<ref name="Disc. 3">{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Tropical Storm Douglas Discussion Number Three|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> During the late morning hours, the cloud tops began to warm, signifying that the system was weakening. A microwave satellite overpass earlier in the day revealed that the storm still had a broad circulation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown|title=Tropical Storm Douglas Discussion Number Four|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> The structure of Douglas continued to deteriorate throughout the day and was barely a tropical storm as satellite estimates put the intensity at 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) to 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Beven|title=Tropical Storm Douglas Discussion Number Five|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.005.shtml?}}</ref> On the morning of July&nbsp;3, wind shear dislocated the center of Douglas even further to the northeast of the deepest convection and the storm began to move over cooler waters. Forecasts showed a rapid degeneration into a remnant low as the storm moved closer to a more hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Tropical Storm Douglas Discussion Number Six|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref><ref name="TCR"/> By the late morning, Douglas was downgraded to a tropical depression as all the deep convection associated with the system dissipated, leaving only mid to low-level convection. <ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Tropical Depression Douglas Discussion Number Seven|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> However, in the post-season analysis, it was determined that Douglas had remained a tropical storm through the early afternoon, six hours longer than the operational advisories. <ref name="TCR"/> By the early afternoon, Douglas was devoid of almost all convection and was a swirl of clouds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Tropical Depression Douglas Discussion Number Eight|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/ep04/ep042008.discus.008.shtml?}}</ref>Douglas degenerated into a remnant low early on the morning of July&nbsp;4. The remnant low moved towards the west for two days before dissipating out over open waters due to the effects of cool waters and strong wind shear. <ref name="TCR"/>

==Impact==
The storm never affected land during its lifespan, and no damage or casualties were reported. <ref name="TCR"/> On July&nbsp;2, a ship located to the southwest of the center reported a sustained wind of 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="Disc. 3"/>
