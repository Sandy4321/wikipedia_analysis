The Hotel John Marshall, first opened in 1929, was one of the leading hospitality establishments in downtown Richmond, Virginia.  After the hotel closed in 2004, the building was renovated into upscale residential apartments that opened in December, 2011.

== Original Development ==

The Hotel John Marshall, located on Fifth Street between Franklin and Grace in downtown Richmond, Virginia, opened its doors on October 30, 1929, the day after the Wall Street Crash.<ref name=autogenerated2>Harry Kollatz Jr., [http://johnmarshallresidences.com/cms/resources/richmond-magazine-article-march-2012.pdf "A Grand Lady's Revival"], ''Richmond Magazine'', March 2012</ref>  The opening night ceremony included dinner for 600 guests, amongst which were both the City Mayor, J. Fulmer Bright, and the Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> 

The hotel<U+2019>s construction was funded by businessman Thomas Gresham, of the Richmond Hotels, Inc., to which hotel group The John Marshall originally belonged.<ref name=autogenerated3>Andy McCutcheon, "Memories Are Rich with Life and Times of Hotel Once Richmond Region's Best"], ''Virginia'', July 1994</ref>   Architect Marcellus E. Wright, who had studied at The Philadelphia School of Applied Art, designed the 16-story building in a neoclassical style with touches of deco and Moorish ornament.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  It cost $2 million to build, and the general contractor was Wise Granite and Construction Co.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  With 418 guest rooms, 500 bathrooms, 2 restaurants in ballrooms in the lobby and a roof garden ballroom on the 16th floor, it was the largest hotel in the state when it opened.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  It is said that the name was chosen by a suggestion contest, with the winning name paying tribute to Chief Justice John Marshall, whose house, now a museum, sits only a few blocks away.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

== Social History ==

When the hotel opened, it advertised itself as <U+201C>The Finest Hotel in the South<U+201D>: from radio outlets every room, a private switchboard manned by the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., to the rooftop garden ballroom, it was considered both modern and luxurious.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
The height of the hotel<U+2019>s prestige was in the 1940s, when it had a staff of 400 (nearly one employee per guest room) and fed some 1,500 people a day in its restaurants.  It had even begun attracting some permanent residents.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  During this time, the rooms, at $3/night, were more expensive than The John Marshall<U+2019>s chief competitors, The Jefferson or the now-demolished Richmond Hotel, which rented for $2/night.<ref name=autogenerated4>Karen Shugart, [http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/marshalls-return/Content?oid=1533842 "Marshall's Return"], ''Style Weekly'', June 21, 2011</ref>
Due to its proximity to the State Capitol, three blocks away, the Hotel hosted many political events.  Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan all attended functions there, as well as Prime Minister Winston Churchill.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  It was a tradition for the outgoing state governor to meet governor-elect at the hotel on inauguration day, to proceed to the Capitol together.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  In 1985 Governor Douglas Wilder celebrated victory as first African-American to become Lieutenant Governor in same room where he<U+2019>d waited tables as a young man.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
Entertainment stars also frequented the hotel, which counted amongst its guests Elvis Presley, Vincent Price, and Elizabeth Taylor.<ref name=autogenerated1>Carol Hazard, [http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/article_bc487bc9-d184-5c1c-a856-834f91e57338.html "New Chapter Awaits the John Marshall"], ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', May 16, 2011</ref>
In 1954, the hotel added a wing of extra room from its north side<ref name=autogenerated3 />, and in 1963 an exposition hall opened for retail and meeting use.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

== Hotel Remodel & Closure ==

In an effort to keep up with changing tastes, in 1978 the hotel went through a significant remodel, with tile paving, gold leaf, and 18<U+2019> atrium in stainless steel.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  Despite this, the development of large new hotels that could host conventions, such as the Omni and Marriott, took a toll on the John Marshall<U+2019>s business in the 1980<U+2019>s.<ref name=autogenerated4 />
In 1988 the remaining staff of 175 were laid off and 60,000 pieces of hotel memorabilia were auctioned off, from chandeliers to dining room demitasse spoons.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  The hotel closed it doors on May 31, 1988, leaving seven employees behind to keep up maintenance on the empty building.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
The hotel re-opened in limited capacity in 1999, after Gilbert Granger, former mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia, had bought it for $3.16 million: 70 rooms were then in use, and the hotel hosted a Martini Kitchen & Bubble Bar.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
The hotel ran in this manner till it closed its door again in 2004.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

== Residential Redevelopment ==

In 2005, Virginia Atlantic Development, Inc., based out of Hampton Roads, acquired the property.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  Dominion Realty Partners came on board in 2007, and so began a $70 million remodel, including $40 million in financing from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and both state and historic tax credits.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  The general contractor for the project was Choate Construction.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
The development team restored the lobby to original 1930<U+2019>s appearance, as well as having the hotel<U+2019>s famous rooftop sign, now rusted, remade in new 9<U+2019> letters to match the original.  Holiday Signs, the designer, had the new letters hauled by crane to the roof on April 11, 2011.<ref>Tom Kapsidelis, [http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/give-me-an-h-historic-hotel-reinstalls-landmark-sign/article_1c7ae1fc-03a4-5a04-978c-566f7e1f9ee2.html?mode=image&photo=1 "Historic Hotel Reinstalls Landmark Sign"], ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', April 11, 2011</ref>  LED bulbs were used, running at only 30% of the energy consumption of the original sign, but they were made to look like light bulbs.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
The building reopened as The Residences at The John Marshall, 238 downtown luxury apartments.  It was observed that just as the hotel opened right after the Great Crash, so the apartments opened as the country was pulling out of Great Recession.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
The Residences kept the long-running John Marshall Barber shop, which is on only its 3rd owner/manager, Hugh Campbell.  The mirrors, countertops, and chairs from the original shop were kept and refinished.<ref>Louis Llovio, [http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/biz-buzz-john-marshall-barber-shop-headed-home/article_4b01e671-3309-5545-9a37-71abe0828f4b.html "John Marshall Barber Shop Headed Home"], ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', November 7, 2011</ref>
While the roof garden ballroom was turned into penthouse units, the two lobby ballrooms were restored, including finding and restoring three of the original five chandeliers.  Well-known Richmond caterer, Suzanne Wolstenholme, runs the ballrooms both as a luncheon venue and site for events such as small concerts and wedding receptions.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
As of spring 2013, the apartments were 100% leased, which has encouraged the building of other residential developments in downtown Richmond.
