The '''United States presidential election of 1948''' is considered by most [[historian]]s as the greatest election [[upset]] in [[History of the United States|American history]]. Virtually every prediction (with or without public opinion polls) indicated that incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] would be defeated by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. Truman won, overcoming a three-way split in his own party. Truman's surprise victory was the fifth consecutive win for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in a presidential election. Truman's election confirmed the Democratic Party's status as the nation's majority party, a status they would retain until the conservative [[realigning election|realignment]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]].

On July 12, the [[1948 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] convened in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in the same arena where the Republicans had met a few weeks earlier. Spirits were low: the Republicans had taken control of both houses of the [[United States Congress]] and a majority of state governorships during the 1946 midterm elections by running against Truman, and the public-opinion polls showed Truman trailing Republican nominee Dewey, sometimes by double digits. Furthermore, some liberal Democrats had joined [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s new Progressive Party, and party leaders feared that Wallace would take enough votes from Truman to give the large Northern and Midwestern states to the Republicans. 

As a result of Truman's low standing in the polls, several Democratic party bosses began working to "dump" Truman and nominate a more popular candidate. Among the leaders of this movement were [[Jacob Arvey]], the [[bossism|boss]] of the [[Chicago]] Democratic organization, [[Frank Hague]], the boss of [[New Jersey]], [[James Roosevelt]], the eldest son of former President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and Senator [[Claude Pepper]] of [[Florida]]. The primary target of the rebels was General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. Despite their efforts, however, Eisenhower refused to become a candidate (in 1952, he revealed that he was a Republican). Rebuffed, the leaders of the "dump" Truman movement then reluctantly agreed to support Truman for the nomination. At the Democratic Convention, a group of Northern liberals, led by [[Minneapolis]] Mayor [[Hubert Humphrey]], successfully pushed through a platform (over vigorous Southern opposition) that promoted [[civil rights]] for blacks. In his speech promoting the civil rights platform, Humphrey memorably stated that "the time has come for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights!" Ironically, while Truman and his staff were ambivalent about supporting the civil rights plank, it did receive strong support from many of the big-city party bosses, most of whom felt that the civil rights platform would encourage the growing black population in their cities to vote for the Democrats. The passage of the civil rights platform caused some three dozen Southern delegates, led by South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]], to walk out of the convention; the Southern delegates who remained nominated Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] of Georgia for the Democratic nomination as a rebuke to Truman. Nonetheless, 947 Democratic delegates voted for Truman as the Democratic nominee, while Russell received only 266 votes, all from the South. Truman then selected Kentucky Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] as his running mate, with this nomination being made by acclamation.

Both major parties courted General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the most popular general of [[World War II]]. Eisenhower's political views were unknown in 1948. He was, later events would prove, a moderate Republican, but in 1948 he flatly refused the nomination of any political party. 

With Eisenhower refusing to run, the contest for the Republican nomination was between New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], former Minnesota Governor [[Harold Stassen]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Ohio Senator [[Robert Taft]], California Governor [[Earl Warren]], and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of Michigan, the senior Republican in the Senate. Governor Dewey, who had been the Republican nominee in 1944, was regarded as the frontrunner when the primaries began. Dewey was the acknowledged leader of the GOP's powerful eastern establishment; in 1946 he had been re-elected Governor of New York by the largest margin in state history. Dewey's handicap was that many Republicans disliked him; he often struck observers as cold, stiff and calculating. Senator Taft was the leader of the GOP's conservative wing. He opened his campaign in 1947 by attacking the Democratic Party's domestic policy and foreign policy. In foreign policy, Taft was an [[isolationist]] who blamed Truman for implementing the [[Morgenthau Plan]] in occupied Germany, thereby wrecking the European economy which (in his view) thus required rescue from U.S. taxpayers in the form of the [[Marshall Plan]]. <ref>http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887493,00.html</ref> In domestic issues, Taft and his fellow conservatives wanted to abolish many of the [[New Deal]] social welfare programs that had been created in the 1930s; they regarded these programs as too expensive and harmful to business interests. Taft had two major weaknesses: he was seen as a plodding, dull campaigner, and he was viewed by most party leaders as being too conservative and controversial to win a presidential election. Taft's support was limited to his native Midwest and parts of the South. Although both Senator Vandenberg and Governor Warren were highly popular in their home states, both men refused to campaign in the primaries, which limited their chances of winning the nomination. However, their supporters hoped that in the event of a Dewey-Taft-Stassen deadlock, the convention would turn to their man as a compromise candidate. General MacArthur was serving in Japan as the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] occupying that nation; as such he was unable to campaign for the nomination. However, he did make it known that he would not decline the GOP nomination if it were offered to him, and some conservative Republicans hoped that by winning a primary contest he could prove his popularity with voters. They chose to enter his name in the Wisconsin primary.  

The "surprise" candidate of 1948 was Stassen, the former "boy wonder" of Minnesota politics. Stassen had been elected governor of Minnesota at the age of 31; he resigned as governor in 1943 to serve in the [[U.S. Navy]] in [[World War II]]. In 1945 he had served on the committee which created the [[United Nations]]. Stassen was widely regarded as the most liberal of the Republican candidates, yet during the primaries he was criticized for being vague on many issues. Stassen stunned Dewey and MacArthur in the Wisconsin primary; Stassen's surprise victory virtually eliminated General MacArthur, whose supporters had made a major effort on his behalf. Stassen defeated Dewey again in the Nebraska primary, thus making him the new frontrunner. He then made the strategic mistake of trying to beat Senator Taft in Taft's home state of Ohio. Stassen believed that if he could defeat Taft in his home state, Taft would be forced to quit the race and most of Taft's delegates would support him instead of Dewey. However, Taft defeated Stassen in his native Ohio, and Stassen earned the hostility of the party's conservatives. Even so, Stassen was still leading Dewey in the polls for the upcoming Oregon primary. However, Dewey, who realized that a defeat in Oregon would end his chances at the nomination, sent his powerful political organization into the state and spent large sums of money on campaign ads in Oregon. Dewey also agreed to debate Stassen in Oregon on national radio - it was the [http://www.ourcampaigns.com/EventDetail.html?EventID=41 first-ever radio debate between presidential candidates]. The sole issue of the debate concerned whether to outlaw the [[Communist Party of the United States]]. Stassen, despite his liberal reputation, argued in favor of outlawing the party, while Dewey forcefully argued against it; at one point he famously stated that "you can't shoot an idea with a gun". Most observers rated Dewey as the winner of the debate, and a few days later Dewey defeated Stassen in Oregon. From this point forward, the New York governor had the momentum he needed to win his party's second nomination.

===Republican Convention===

The [[1948 Republican National Convention]] was held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It was the first presidential convention to be shown on national [[television]]. As the convention opened Dewey was believed to have a large lead in the delegate count. His major opponents - Taft, Stassen, and Senator Vandenberg - met in Taft's hotel suite to plan a "stop-Dewey" movement. However, a key obstacle soon developed when the three men refused to unite behind a single candidate to oppose Dewey. Instead, all three men simply agreed to try and hold their own delegates in the hopes of preventing Dewey from obtaining a majority. This proved to be futile, as Dewey's efficient campaign team methodically gathered the remaining delegates they needed to win the nomination. After the second round of balloting, Dewey was only 33 votes short of victory. Taft then called Stassen and urged him to withdraw from the race and endorse him as Dewey's main opponent. When Stassen refused, Taft wrote a concession speech and had it read at the start of the third ballot; Dewey was then nominated by [[acclamation]]. Dewey then chose popular Governor [[Earl Warren]] of [[California]] as his running mate. Following the convention, most political experts in the [[news media]] rated the GOP ticket as an almost-certain winner over the Democrats.

=== Progressive Party nomination ===
[[Image:Henry A. Wallace.jpg|thumb|Progressive Party Nominee, Former Vice-President [[Henry A. Wallace]].]]
Meanwhile, the Democratic party had fragmented. A new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] <U+2014> the name had been used earlier by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1912 and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] in 1924 <U+2014> was created afresh in 1948 with the nomination of [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], who had served as [[Secretary of Agriculture]] and [[Vice-President]] under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1946 President Truman had fired Wallace as [[Secretary of Commerce]] when Wallace publicly opposed Truman's firm moves to counter the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. Wallace's 1948 platform opposed the [[Cold War]] policies of President Truman, including the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[Truman Doctrine]]. The Progressives proposed stronger government regulation and control of [[Big Business]]. They also campaigned to end discrimination against blacks and women, backed a minimum wage and called for the elimination of the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], which was investigating the issue of [[communist]] spies within the U.S. government and [[labor unions]]. Wallace and his supporters believed that the committee was violating the [[civil liberties]] of government workers and labor unions. However, the Progressives also generated a great deal of controversy, due to the widespread belief that they were secretly controlled by Communists who were more loyal to the [[Soviet Union]] than the United States. Wallace himself denied being a Communist, but he repeatedly refused to disavow their support, and at one point was quoted as saying that the "Communists are the closest thing to the early Christian martyrs". Wallace was also hurt when [[Westbrook Pegler]], a prominent conservative newspaper columnist, revealed that Wallace as Vice-President had written coded letters discussing prominent politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill]] to his Russian [[New Age]] spiritual [[guru]], [[Nicholas Roerich]]. This revelation - and quotes from the letters were published - led to much ridicule of Wallace in the national press.
The Progressive Party Convention, which was held in Philadelphia, was a highly contentious affair; several famous newspaper journalists, such as [[H.L. Mencken]] and [[Dorothy Thompson]], publicly accused the Progressives of being covertly controlled by Communists. Several leading figures of the Progressive Party (such as [[socialist]] leader [[Norman Thomas]]) quit the party in protest over what they perceived as the undue influence Communists exerted over Wallace. Thomas ran as the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate to offer non-Communist liberals an alternative to Wallace.  

Senator [[Glen H. Taylor]] of [[Idaho]], an eccentric figure who was known as a "singing cowboy" and who had ridden his horse "Nugget" up the steps of the [[United States Capitol]] after winning election to the Senate in 1944, was named as Wallace's running mate.

=== States' Rights Democratic Party nomination ===
The Southern Democrats who had bolted the Democratic Convention over Truman's civil rights platform promptly met at [[Boutwell Memorial Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and formed yet another political party, which they named the "[[States' Rights]]" Democratic Party. More commonly known as the <U+201C>[[Dixiecrat]]s<U+201D>, the party's main goal was continuing the policy of [[racial segregation]] in the South and the [[Jim Crow laws]] that sustained it. South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]], who had led the walkout, became the party's presidential nominee. Mississippi Governor [[Fielding L. Wright]] received the vice presidential nomination. Although the Dixiecrats did not expect to win the election, they did hope to take enough Southern states from Truman to [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Electoral College under Amendment XII|force]] the election into the [[United States House of Representatives]], where they could then extract concessions from either Truman or Dewey on racial issues in exchange for their support. Even if Truman lost the election, the Dixiecrats hoped that their defection would show that the Democratic Party needed Southern support in order to win national elections, and that this fact would weaken the pro-civil rights movement among Northern and Western Democrats. However, the Dixiecrats were weakened when most Southern Democratic leaders (such as Governor [[Herman Talmadge]] of Georgia and "Boss" [[Edward H. Crump]] of Tennessee) refused to support the party. Despite being an incumbent President, Truman was not placed on the ballot in Alabama.<ref> Hugh Alvin Bone, ''American Politics and the Party System'', p262 (McGraw-Hill 1955). </ref>

Given Truman's sinking popularity and the seemingly fatal three-split in the Democratic Party, Dewey appeared unbeatable. Top Republicans believed that all their candidate had to do to win was to avoid major mistakes; in keeping with this advice, Dewey carefully avoided risks. He spoke in platitudes, avoided controversial issues, and was vague on what he planned to do as President. Speech after speech was filled with non-political, optimistic assertions of the obvious, including the now infamous quote <U+201C>You know that your future is still ahead of you.<U+201D> An editorial in ''[[The Courier-Journal|The (Louisville) Courier-Journal]]'' summed it up best: <U+201C>No presidential candidate in the future will be so inept that four of his major speeches can be boiled down to these historic four sentences: Agriculture is important. Our rivers are full of fish. You cannot have freedom without liberty. Our future lies ahead.<U+201D><ref>{{cite book| last=Donaldson| first=Gary A.| title=Truman Defeats Dewey| page=173| publisher=The University Press of Kentucky| year=1999}} Quoting ''[[The Courier-Journal|The (Louisville) Courier-Journal]]'', November 18, 1948.</ref> Truman, trailing in the polls, decided to adopt a slashing, no-holds-barred campaign. He ridiculed Dewey by name, criticized Dewey's refusal to address specific issues, and scornfully targeted the Republican-controlled 80th Congress with a wave of relentless, and blistering, partisan assaults. He nicknamed the Republican-controlled Congress as the "do-nothing" Congress, a remark which brought strong criticism from GOP Congressional leaders (such as Senator Taft), but no comment from Dewey. In fact, Dewey rarely mentioned Truman's name during the campaign, which fit into his strategy of appearing to be above petty partisan politics. 

[[Image:Staggers-truman1948.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the mike, left [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers]] & [[Alben W. Barkley]]. 1948 in [[Keyser, West Virginia]] on [[Whistle stop train tour|Whistle Stop Train]]]]

Under Dewey's leadership, the Republicans had enacted a platform at their [[1948 Republican National Convention|1948 convention]] that called for expanding [[social security]], more funding for public housing, [[civil rights]] legislation, and promotion of health and education by the federal government. These positions were, however, unacceptable to the conservative Congressional Republican leadership. Truman exploited this rift in the opposing party by calling [[Turnip Day Session|a special session of Congress]] on <U+201C>Turnip Day<U+201D> (referring to an old piece of Missouri folklore about planting turnips in late July) and daring the Republican Congressional leadership to pass its own platform. The [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]] played into Truman's hands, delivering very little in the way of substantive legislation during this time. The GOP's lack of action in the "turnip" session of Congress allowed Truman to continue his attacks on the "do-nothing" Republican-controlled Congress. Truman simply ignored the fact that Dewey's policies were considerably more liberal than most of his fellow Republicans, and instead he concentrated his fire against the conservative, obstructionist tendencies of the unpopular 80th Congress. For his part, Dewey remained aloof. Following the advice of his campaign staff, he did not respond directly to Truman's attacks. This would prove to be a major mistake.

[[Image:What's the use of going through with the Election.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Clifford K. Berryman]] depicts the attitude of the time]]

Truman toured -- and transfixed -- much of the nation with his fiery rhetoric, playing to large, enthusiastic crowds. <U+201C>Give 'em hell, Harry,<U+201D> was a popular slogan shouted out at stop after stop along the tour. However, the polls and the pundits all held that Dewey's lead was insurmountable, and that Truman's efforts were for naught. Indeed, Truman's own staff considered the campaign a last hurrah. The only person who appears to have considered Truman's campaign to be winnable was the President himself, who confidently predicted victory to anyone and everyone who would listen to him. However, even Truman's own wife had private doubts that her husband could win. 

In the final weeks of the campaign, American movie theatres agreed to play two short newsreel-like campaign films in support of the two major-party candidates; each film had been created by its respective campaign organization. The Dewey film, shot professionally on an impressive budget, featured very high production values, but somehow reinforced an image of the New York governor as cautious and distant. The Truman film, hastily assembled on virtually no budget by the perpetually cash-short Truman campaign, relied heavily on public-domain and newsreel footage of the President taking part in major world events and signing important legislation. Perhaps unintentionally, the Truman film visually reinforced an image of the President as engaged and decisive. Years later, historian [[David McCullough]] cited the expensive, but lackluster, Dewey film, and the far cheaper, but more effective, Truman film, as important factors in determining the preferences of undecided voters.

=== Results ===
[[Image:deweytruman12.jpg|thumb|Famous photograph of Truman grinning and holding up a copy of the newspaper that (erroneously) announced his defeat]]
On election night - November 2 - Dewey, his family, and campaign staff confidently gathered in the Roosevelt Hotel in [[New York City]] to await the returns. Truman, aided by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], sneaked away from reporters covering him in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and made his way to nearby [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]], a small resort town. There he took a room in the local hotel, had a [[Turkish bath]], and went to sleep. As the returns came in Truman took an early lead which he never lost. However, the leading radio commentators, such as [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] of [[NBC]], confidently predicted that once the "late returns" came in Dewey would overcome Truman's lead and win. At midnight, Truman awoke and turned on the radio in his room; he heard Kaltenborn announce that, while Truman was still ahead in the popular vote, he couldn't possibly win. Around 4 a.m. Truman awoke again, heard on the radio that his lead was nearly two million votes, and decided to ride back to Kansas City. For the rest of his life Truman would gleefully mimic Kaltenborn's voice predicting his defeat throughout that election night. Dewey, meanwhile, realized that he was in trouble when early returns from New York and [[New England]] showed him running well behind his expected vote total. He stayed up throughout the night examining the votes as they came in. By 10:30 the next morning he was convinced that he had lost; he then sent a gracious telegram of concession to Truman.

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', then a pro-Republican newspaper, was so sure of Dewey's victory it printed <U+201C>[[Dewey Defeats Truman|DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN]]<U+201D> on election night as its headline for the following day. A famous photograph taken the next morning showed Truman grinning and holding up a copy of that newspaper. Part of the reason Truman's victory came as such a shock was because of as-yet uncorrected flaws in the emerging craft of public opinion polling. A political theory supported by many pollsters (and largely discredited by the 1948 election) held that voters had already decided who they would support by the time the political conventions ended during the summer, and that few voters were swayed by the campaigning done during the autumn. As a result many pollsters were so confident of Dewey's victory that they simply stopped polling voters weeks before the election, and thus missed a last-minute surge of support for the Democrats. It has been estimated that some 14% of Dewey's supporters - swayed by Truman's claims that an economic depression could return under GOP rule - switched to Truman in the final days before the election. After 1948, pollsters would survey voters until the day before the election: they would also announce their results on television, in real time, more or less. 

The key states in the 1948 election were [[Ohio]], [[California]], and [[Illinois]]. Truman narrowly won all three states by a margin of less than 1%. These three states had a combined total of 78 electoral votes. Had Dewey carried all three states by the same narrow margins, he would have won the election in the [[electoral college]] while still losing the popular vote. The extreme closeness of the vote in these three states was the major reason why Dewey waited until late on the morning of November 3 to concede. A similarly narrow margin garnered [[Idaho]] and [[Nevada]]'s electoral votes for Truman. Dewey countered by narrowly carrying [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], the states with the most electoral votes at the time, as well as [[Michigan]], but it wasn't enough to give him the election. Dewey would always believe that he lost the election because he lost the [[rural]] vote in the Midwest, which he had won in the 1944 presidential election.

Truman's victory can be attributed to many factors: his aggressive, populist campaign style; Dewey's complacent, distant approach to the campaign, and his failure to respond to Truman's attacks; the major shift in public opinion from Dewey to Truman during the late stages of the campaign; broad public approval of Truman's foreign policy, notably the [[Berlin Airlift]] of that year; and widespread dissatisfaction with the institution Truman labeled as the "do-nothing, good-for-nothing 80th Republican Congress." In fact, it was essentially a Democratic year, as the Democrats not only retained the presidency but recaptured both houses of Congress, as well. Furthermore, the two third parties did not hurt Truman nearly as much as expected. Thurmond's Dixiecrats carried only four Southern states, a lower total than predicted. The civil rights platform helped Truman win large majorities among black voters in the populous Northern and Midwestern states, and may well have made the difference for Truman in states such as Illinois and Ohio. Wallace's Progressives received only 2.5% of the national popular vote - well below their expected vote total - and Wallace did not take as many liberal votes from Truman as many political [[pundits]] had predicted.

The 1948 election marked only the second time in American presidential election history that the winning candidate won despite losing Pennsylvania and New York (the first time being the 1916 election - later such elections included 1968, 2000, and 2004). It also refuted elections from across the world, as Truman was the war leader who managed to win re-election. As of 2008, Truman is the most unpopular leader to win re-election, though his standing with all Americans increased so much in the ensuing decades that he is now remembered by many historians as one of the greatest presidents of the 20th century.
