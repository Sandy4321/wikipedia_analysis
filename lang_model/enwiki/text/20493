The '''Abbey Church of St Mary the Virgin''' at [[Sherborne]] in the English county of [[Dorset]], is usually called '''Sherborne Abbey'''. It has been a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] [[cathedral]] (705<U+2013>1075), a [[Benedictine]] abbey (998<U+2013>1539), and, now, a [[parish church]].

== History ==
=== Cathedral ===
There may have been a [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Christian]] church called 'Lanprobi' at the site, and Kenwalc or [[Cenwalh]], King of the West Saxons is believed to be one of its founders.<ref name="Friendsbook">{{cite book|last= The Friends of Sherborne Abbey|first=|title= The Abbey Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Sherborne|format= Paperback|accessdate= 2008-07-03|edition= 12|year= 1959|month= May|publisher= Sawtells of Sherborne Ltd.|location= [[Sherborne]] United Kingdom|isbn=}}</ref>

When the Saxon Diocese of Sherborne was founded in 705 by King [[Ine of Wessex]], he set [[Aldhelm]] as first [[Bishop]] of the see of Western [[Wessex]], with his seat at Sherborne. Aldhelm was the first of twenty-seven [[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishops of Sherborne]].<ref name="Friendsbook"/><ref name="cat enc">{{cite encyclopedia| last = | first = | author = G. Cyprian Alston| authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopaedia| title = Sherborne Abbey| url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Sherborne_Abbey| accessdate = 2008-07-12| year = 1913}}</ref>

=== Abbey ===
The twentieth bishop was [[Wulfsige III]] (or St. Wulfsin). In 998 he established a Benedictine abbey at Sherborne and became its first abbot. In 1075 the bishopric of Sherborne was transferred to [[Old Sarum Cathedral|Old Sarum]], so Sherborne remained an abbey church but was no longer a cathedral.  The bishop (in Old Sarum) remained the nominal head of the abbey until 1122, when [[Roger de Caen]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], made the abbey independent.

=== Parish church ===
The Benedictine foundation at Sherborne ended in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, when the abbey was surrendered to King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  Various properties at Sherborne were bought from the king by [[John Horsey (died 1546)|Sir John Horsey]] who then sold the abbey to the people of Sherborne, who bought the building to be their parish church (as people of many other places did), which it still is. The original parish church alongside the abbey was demolished, though the foundations are still visible. In 1550, King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] issued a new charter to the school that had existed at Sherborne since 705, and some of the remaining abbey buildings were turned over to it.

== Architecture ==
The Abbey has several distinct architectural styles throughout. [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] features still remain in some parts of the Abbey, mainly around the Western door. [[Roger of Caen]] knocked down the bulk of the Saxon church and replaced it with a much larger, [[Norman architecture|Norman]] style church. 

The Lady Chapel and Bishop Robert's Chapel were added in the 13th Century in the [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English style]], and in the 15th century, the choir section was rebuilt in the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular style]], including the [[fan vault|fan-vaulting]] Sherborne is still famous for, the remodelling by [[William Smyth (architect)|William Smyth]], under Abbot [[John Brunyng]] (1415<U+2013>1436). The vaulting is believed to have finished in 1490.<ref name="Friendsbook"/> 

During this renovation, a riot in the town caused a fire that damaged much of the renovation,<ref name="cat enc"/> causing delays. Traces of the fire's effects can still be seen in the reddening of the walls under the Tower. The fire and its effects also caused the design of the Nave to be altered. Some of the Nave's pillars are Norman piers cased in Perpendicular panelling.<ref name="Friendsbook"/>

St Katherine's Chapel, built in the 14th century, but altered in the 15th, contains examples of early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance classicism architecture]] <ref name="sherborneleweston">{{cite web|url= http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/sherborneleweston.htm |title= Sherborne Abbey: St Katherine's Chapel|accessdate= 2008-07-13}}</ref>

== Other features ==
=== Colours ===

The North Nave Aisle, sometimes called the 'Trinitie' or 'Dark' Aisle (as it is overshadowed by the adjoining Cloisters) contains several [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]] from the [[Dorset Regiment|2nd Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment]] and the Dorsetshire Militia. The South Nave Aisle contains colours of the [[Dorset Regiment|1st Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment]].<ref name="Friendsbook"/>

=== Memorials and tombs ===

The North Choir Aisle contains two tombs, believed to be the tombs of King [[<U+00C6>thelbald of Wessex]] and his brother King [[Ethelbert of Wessex]], elder brothers to [[Alfred the Great]].<ref name="Friendsbook"/><ref name="DestinationsUK">{{cite web|url= http://www.destinations-uk.com/articles.php?link=articles&country=england&id=371&articletitle=Sherborne%20Abbey |title= Destinations UK: Sherborne Abbey|accessdate= 2008-07-13}}</ref>

Inside the Wykeham chapel is the tomb of [[John Horsey (died 1546)|Sir John Horsey]] and [[John Horsey (died 1564)|his son]]. Horsey had bought the church after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and sold it to the townspeople. Also in the Chapel is the plainly marked tomb of the poet [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]].<ref name="sherbornewykeham">{{cite web|url= http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/sherbornehorsey.htm |title= Sherborne Abbey: The Horsey Tomb|accessdate= 2008-07-13}}</ref>

The South Transept contains an impressive [[baroque]] memorial to John Digby, 3rd [[Earl of Bristol]], made of marble and designed by [[John Nost]].<ref name="sherbornedigby">{{cite web|url= http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/sherbornedigbym.htm |title= Sherborne Abbey: The South Transept and Digby Memorial|accessdate= 2008-07-13}}</ref> Additionally there is a memorial to Robert and May Digby.<ref name="Friendsbook"/>

St Katherine's Chapel contains the 16th century tomb of John Leweston and wife Joan.<ref name="sherborneleweston"/> The Chapel was where [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and Lady Raleigh attended services.<ref name="Friendsbook"/>

The North Aisle contains a memorial to Abbot Clement (1163) and an effigy to an unknown Prior, while the South Aisle contains an effigy of Abbot Lawrence of Bradford (1246).<ref name="Friendsbook"/>

The Digby Memorial, situated outside the Abbey, is a memorial to George Digby who provided a lot of funding for renovation work during the 19th century. It was built in 1884 and features statues of St Aldhelm, [[Roger of Salisbury|Bishop Roger of Salisbury (Roger de Caen)]], Abbot Bradford and Sir Walter Raleigh.<ref name="sherbornedigbymemorial">{{cite web|url=

=== Organ ===

The Abbey's organ, located in the North Transept was installed in 1858 by [[Gray & Davison]], and completely rebuilt in 1955 by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]], though that restoration's action failed by 1987 and had to be replaced.  The proposed scheme by Bishops supported by John Norman, Cecil Clutton and Patrick Moule favoured returning the organ to its Gray & Davison past but including a 'Chair' section instead of the Choir in order to try to overcome the difficulties of the position of the organ was bold but hardly in keeping historically and proved a to be musically and  mechanically a disaster and increasingly unreliable so that after no more than twenty years it was necessary for the Organ to be rebuilt again in 2003/04 by Kenneth Tickell, so thoroughly as to make it effectively a new instrument in the old case. An additional nave organ was added, located under the West Window.<ref name="Friendsbook"/><ref name="sherborneorgan">{{cite web|url= http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/sherborneorgan.htm |title= Sherborne Abbey: The Organ|accessdate= 2008-07-12}}</ref>
