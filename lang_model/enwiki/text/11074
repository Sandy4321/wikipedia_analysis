His first run for public office was for the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] in 1998, while still a junior in college; he won the primary but lost in the general election. The Democratic winner was the father of a high school classmate.

After earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]] in 1999, McHenry worked for the media consulting firm DCI/New Media, in Washington, D.C. He was involved in [[Rick Lazio]]'s campaign against [[Hillary Clinton]] during the [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|November 2000 United States Senate election in New York]]; his main project was running a Web site, NotHillary.com.<ref name=WM/>

==Early political career==
In mid-2000, McHenry was hired by [[Karl Rove]] to be the National Coalition Director for [[George W. Bush]]'s successful [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]].<ref name=WM/> In late 2000 and early 2001, he was a volunteer coordinator for Bush's inaugural committee. After working for six months in 2001 as a special assistant to [[Elaine Chao]], the [[United States Secretary of Labor]] in Washington, D.C., McHenry returned to North Carolina and ran again for the [[North Carolina General Assembly|state legislature]], winning in the November 2002 general election.

A resident of [[Cherryville, North Carolina]], McHenry represented the state's 109th House district, including constituents in [[Gaston County]], for the [[North Carolina General Assembly of 2003-2004|2003<U+2013>2004 session]]. While in the legislature, he sat on the House Appropriations Committee.

===Legislation===
In the 109th Congress, McHenry authored legislation which would increase the penalty for anyone who manufactured [[methamphetamine]] in the presence of a child.

In 2008, McHenry opposed {{USBill|110|HR|5767}}, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling").

McHenry was honored by the North Carolina Chapters of the [[American Legion]] and [[Marine Corps League]] after assisting in bringing a Veteran's Community Based Outpatient Clinic to [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]], a project his predecessor [[Cass Ballenger]] had begun before his retirement.<ref>[http://www.lincolntribune.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7838 Veterans Groups Recognize Congressman McHenry For Work On Behalf Of Veterans <U+2013> Local News <U+2013> News : Lincoln Tribune : Instant, reliable and credible local news<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After the passing of Senator [[Jesse Helms]], McHenry sponsored a resolution ({{USBill|110|HRes|608}}) honoring Helms's life and service.<ref>{{USBill|110|HRes|608}} in the 110th Congress</ref>  Every member of the North Carolina delegation co-sponsored his resolution, and it was passed by the House of Representatives by unanimous consent.

On March 2, 2010, McHenry proposed new legislation, H.R. 4705, that would redesign the face of the [[United States fifty-dollar bill|$50 bill]] to include the likeness of the 40th President, Ronald Reagan.

The House passed two bills sponsored by Congressman McHenry in 2011. The first terminated the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-839 Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)]. The second was the [http://mchenry.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=267628 Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act], commonly referred to as Crowdfunding and was introduced to foster relationships between investors and entrepreneurs.  Specifically, it permits crowdfunding issuances that offer an equity stake (securities) to investors.

==Controversies==
==="Two-bit" security guard comment===
McHenry stirred further controversy with his remarks on April 1, 2008, regarding a trip to Iraq. Speaking to 150 Republicans attending the [[Lincoln County, North Carolina|Lincoln County]] GOP Dinner, he called a contractor <U+2014> reported first by blogs as a "U.S. soldier"<ref>[http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/04/rep-mchenry-calls-us-soldier-in-iraq-a-two-bit-security-guard/ Think Progress <U+00BB> Rep.

<blockquote>We spent the night in the [[Green Zone]], in the poolhouse of one of Saddam<U+2019>s palaces. A little weird, I got to be honest with you. But I felt safe. And so in the morning, I got up early <U+2014> not that I make this a great habit <U+2014> but I went to the gym because I just couldn<U+2019>t sleep and everything else. Well, sure enough, the guard wouldn<U+2019>t let me in. Said I didn<U+2019>t have the correct credentials.

It<U+2019>s 5:00 in the morning. I haven<U+2019>t had sleep.  I was not very happy with this two bit security guard.

===Baghdad video===
McHenry was also the subject of discussion regarding a video, posted on his Congressional campaign website, that featured him in the [[Green Zone]] in [[Baghdad]], pointing out landmarks and destruction after missile attacks. Veteran's affairs blog ''VetVoice'' posted a scathing attack, claiming that McHenry's video violated [[OPSEC]], Operational Security.<ref>[http://www.vetvoice.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=947 VetVoice: Congressman McHenry Violates OPSEC; Endangers Troops<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  McHenry later removed the video after discussing the information with [[the Pentagon]], which requested McHenry not place the video back online.<ref>[http://www.news-record.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080410/NRSTAFF/472848578 Iraq visit hurts congressman : News-Record.com : Greensboro, North Carolina<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Lance Sigmon]], McHenry's opponent, later went on to call a press conference to demand an investigation regarding the full nature of the video's effect on Green Zone Troops.<ref>[http://www.charlotte.com/politics/story/587606.html] {{citation broken|date=November 2008}}</ref>{{citation broken|date=November 2008}}  Sigmon attacked McHenry in a campaign ad regarding this controversy, prompting McHenry to threaten legal action, claiming the ad was false.<ref>[http://www.newstopic.net/articles/2008/04/22/news/75ad.txt News-Topic, Lenoir, NC, 28645 <U+2013> news, sports, editorials, obituaries<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Use of PAC funds===
On April 16, 2008, Capitol Hill newspaper ''[[Roll Call]]'' revealed that McHenry used funds from his [[Political action committee|PAC]], "More Conservatives", to fund the defense of former aide Michael Aaron Lay's [[voter fraud]] charges incurred during McHenry's 2004 race.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_121/money_matters/23041-1.html Necessary Overhead? <U+2013> Roll Call<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  McHenry gave Lay $20,000 to pay legal bills on voter fraud charges brought while Lay worked for him.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/53_121/money_matters/23041-1.html Necessary Overhead? <U+2013> Roll Call]</ref>  These expenses were labeled as "Legal Expense Donation", according to [[FEC]] reports. Lay agreed to a [[deferred prosecution agreement]], which stipulated he complete 100 hours of community service and pay $240.50 in [[court fees]] and $250.00 in community service fees to have the charges dismissed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Lay, an employee of the 2004 campaign, lived in McHenry's home in Cherryville which also served as the campaign headquarters during the 2004 election, was indicted for voter fraud in McHenry's election, allegedly voted illegally in two separate instances.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2007/05/11/primarysource/entry2793560.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Congressman McHenry's Campaign Aide Indicted | first=Michael | last=Rey | date=May 11, 2007}}</ref> McHenry, in response, claimed the case was part of a "three-year smear campaign" by District Attorney Locke Bell,<ref>[http://www.shelbystar.com/news/mchenry_21725___article.html/lay_news.html Breaking News: McHenry campaign aide indicted for voter fraud from 2004 election, mchenry, lay, news : The Star Online : The Newspaper of Cleveland County<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> despite Locke Bell fund raising for McHenry in previous elections.<ref>[http://www.charlotte.com/217/story/122192.html] {{citation broken|date=November 2008}}</ref>{{citation broken|date=November 2008}}

===Countrywide donations===
McHenry has also been called out by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]]' Capital Eye, who found evidence that McHenry had been taking money from [[Countrywide Financial]], a company now involved in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/06/countrywides-campaign-contribu.html OpenSecrets | Countrywide's Campaign Contributions Weren't Loans, But They Were Investments <U+2013> Capital Eye<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> McHenry took $5,500 from Countrywide's [[Political action committee|PAC]], and served in an investigation into [[CEO]] payout fraud, of which one of the target companies was Countrywide Financial itself.

===Attack on opponent===
McHenry has been the subject of controversy after making allegations that his challenger, [[Daniel Johnson (naval officer)|Daniel Johnson]], was "[[Nancy Pelosi]]'s Chosen Recruit" with "pockets stuffed from cash from Washington liberals". [[North Carolina Republican Party]] leaders spoke out about these comments<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/40591.html McClatchy Washington Bureau | 06/12/2008 | Will crying 'liberal' help GOP this year?

===Council on American-Islamic Relations===
McHenry joined Senator [[Tom Coburn|Thomas Coburn]] (R-OK) and Congressmen [[Sue Myrick]] (R-NC), [[Trent Franks]] (R-AZ), [[John Shadegg]] (R-AZ), and [[Paul Broun]] (R-GA) in a letter to [[IRS Commissioner]] [[Douglas H. Shulman]] on November 16, 2009, asking that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) be investigated for excessive lobbying and failing to register as a lobbying organization.<ref>[http://www.wnd.com/files/cairirsletter.PDF "Letter to IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman, from Senator Tom Coburn and Representatives Sue Myrick, Trent Franks, John Shadegg, Paul Broun, and Patrick McHenry," November 16, 2009, accessed November 17, 2009]</ref><ref>[http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/tom_coburn_joins_campaign_against_muslim_group_cai.php Elliot, Justin, "Tom Coburn Joins Campaign Against Muslim Group," ''[[TPMMuckraker]]'', November 18, 2009, accessed November 18, 2009]</ref>  The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', the foreword of which had been penned by Congresswoman [[Sue Myrick]], that portrayed the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) as a subversive organization allied with international terrorists.<ref name=co>[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/topstories/story/1047173.html Doyle, Michael, "Judge: Controversial 'Muslim Mafia' used stolen papers", ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', November 10, 2009, accessed November 17, 2009]</ref>

===Elizabeth Warren===
On May 24, 2011, [[Elizabeth Warren]]<U+2014>appointed by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] to oversee the development of the new [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)]]<U+2014>attended a House subcommittee meeting chaired by McHenry, who invited her because he felt she had given misleading testimony during another hearing.  Earlier that day, McHenry had appeared on [[CNBC]] and accused Warren of lying to Congress about her involvement in government inquiries into mortgage servicing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|title=Decorum Breaks Down at House Hearing|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/25consume.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> 

The meeting had several late and last minute changes, so Warren altered her schedule to accommodate the chair's request.  Around 2:15 pm, McHenry called for a temporary recess to partake in a floor vote.  In response, Warren indicated that McHenry's staff had agreed to the 2:15 pm closing time to allow her ample time to attend another meeting. McHenry replied, "You had no agreement. ... You're making this up, Ms. Warren.  This is not the case."  As Warren and some in the audience reacted with surprise, Rep. [[Elijah Cummings]] interjected, "Mr. Chairman ... I'm trying to be cordial here, but you just accused the lady of lying. I think you need to clear this up with your staff."<ref>{{cite web|title=Chairman McHenry Calls Elizabeth Warren a Liar at Subcommittee Hearing|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RET2Z5AVJ8A&feature=player_embedded|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

Although the CFPB confirmed the agreement, McHenry refused to apologize for his remarks to Warren.<ref>{{cite web|last=McAuliff|first=Michael|title=Elizabeth Warren Called Liar At CFPB Hearing By Republicans Who Botched Facts On Agency (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/24/elizabeth-warren-liar-gop-facts-cfpb_n_866505.html|publisher=Huffington Post}}</ref>  

The ''[[Hickory Daily Record]]'', the largest paper in McHenry's district, called for McHenry to apologize, saying that it was "unacceptable for any member of Congress, especially a subcommittee chairman," to treat a witness in the manner with which he treated Warren.<ref>{{cite news |title=EDITORIAL: McHenry should apologize to voters |url=http://www2.hickoryrecord.com/news/2011/may/28/8/editorial-mchenry-should-apologize-voters-ar-1074309/ |newspaper=[[Hickory Daily Record]] |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
===2004===
In 2004, after one term in the North Carolina General Assembly, McHenry successfully ran for Congress in the [[North Carolina's 10th congressional district|10th Congressional district]], which had come open when nine-term incumbent [[Cass Ballenger]] retired. McHenry faced a heavily contested primary in the 10th and bested his closest opponent, [[Catawba County, North Carolina|Catawba County]] [[Sheriff]] David Huffman, in a primary runoff by only 85 votes.

In the general election, McHenry won 64% of the popular vote, defeating [[Democratic party (United States)|Democrat]] Anne Fischer. However, it was generally thought McHenry's victory in the primary runoff was [[tantamount to election]] in November: his district is considered North Carolina's most Republican district, having sent Republicans to represent it since 1963.

===2006===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2006}}
In the 2006 election, McHenry defeated Democrat [[Richard Carsner]], gaining almost 62% of the vote on the way to a second term representing the 10th District.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2008#District 10}}
In 2008, McHenry defeated [[Lance Sigmon]] in the Republican primary, winning 67% of the vote, and faced Democrat [[Daniel Johnson (naval officer)|Daniel Johnson]] in the general election.  Johnson was considered the strongest and best-funded Democrat to run in the district in over 20 years.  In part because of this, the [[Cook Political Report]] moved the race from "Safe Republican" to "Likely Republican."  This meant that in [[Charlie Cook]]'s opinion, while McHenry still had a considerable advantage, a victory by Johnson could not be ruled out.  Shortly after the Cook Political Report's update, [[Stuart Rothenberg]] of the [[Rothenberg Political Report]], also a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, addressed the race and indicated his opinion that an upset is unlikely.<ref>[http://reader.feedshow.com/show_items-feed=af27380f84bb9685c27446d08e3c60eb How Long Are the House Democrats<U+2019> Really Long Shots?]</ref>  McHenry won the 2008 election, 57.56% to 42.44%.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/7937/13362/en/reports.html | title = 2008 General Elections: Reports (unofficial results) | publisher = North Carolina State Board of Elections | date = November 6, 2008<!-- 13:34:08 EST -->| accessdate = November 7, 2008 }}</ref>
