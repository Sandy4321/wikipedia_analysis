The '''Australian Cattle Dog''' (ACD or Cattle Dog) is a breed of [[herding dog]] originally developed in Australia for [[droving]] cattle over long distances across rough terrain. In the 19th century, [[New South Wales]] cattle farmer Thomas Hall [[crossbreed|crossed]] the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, [[Northumberland]], with [[dingoes]] he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as [[Halls Heeler]]s. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates, and were subsequently developed into two modern breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the [[Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog]]. Influential in the Cattle Dog's early development was [[Robert Kaleski]] who wrote the first [[Breed standard (dogs)|standard]] for the breed.

The Australian Cattle Dog is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a 'red' or 'blue' dog. It has been nicknamed a "Red Heeler" or "Blue Heeler" on the basis of this colouring and its practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in [[Queensland]], Australia, which were successful at shows and at [[Stud (animal)|stud]] in the 1940s were called "Queensland Heelers" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales, and this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.

As with dogs from other [[working dog|working breeds]], the Australian Cattle Dog has a high level of energy, a quick intelligence, and an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly when the training is interesting and challenging. It is not aggressive, but forms a strong attachment with its owners and can be protective of them and their possessions, and it was bred to bite. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than a brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both [[Heredity|hereditary]] conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years. Australian Cattle Dogs now participate in a range of activities beyond the herding they were bred to do, including competing with their owners in [[List of dog sports|sporting]] events and working as [[assistance dogs]].

==Characteristics==
=== Appearance===
[[File:Cattledog Little Joe.JPG|thumb|alt=Blue Cattle dog with a black spot over its eye|Black mask and tan markings on a blue dog]] 
The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful [[Snout|muzzle]]. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.<ref name=ANKC>{{cite web|url=http://www.ankc.org.au/Breed_Details.aspx?bid=132|title=ANKC Breed Standard for the Australian Cattle Dog|date=14 Dec 2009| publisher=Australian National Kennel Council|accessdate=11 September 2011 }}</ref>

The Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or [[conformation show|show]] purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.<ref name=ANKC/>

====Size====
The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately {{convert|43|-|48|cm|in}} at the [[withers]], and the male measures about {{convert|46|-|51|cm|in}} at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.<ref name=ANKC/> An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around {{convert|20|-|28|kg|lb}}.<ref name ="Buetow2"/>

====Coat and colour====
[[File:Australian Cattle Dog puppy.jpg|thumb|alt = A red Australian Cattle Dog with a red puppy whose colour has not yet developed|A puppy whose red hair has not yet developed]]
There are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]] colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking [[gene]]. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.<ref>Ruvinsky (2001), p. 80</ref>

In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for [[conformation show]]s. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows.<ref name=ANKC/> Both colour forms can have a white 'star' on the forehead called the 'Bentley Mark' after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley.<ref name=Buetow>{{cite web|url=http://www.cattledog.com/misc/faq.html|author =Buetow, Katherine| title= Questions Frequently Asked About the Australian Cattle Dog|date= Jan 2009|work=Australian Cattle Dogs Online |accessdate=27 December 2009}}</ref> Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called creeping tan.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 134</ref> The Cattle Dog has a double coat<U+2014>the short, straight outer [[guard hairs]] are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.<ref name=Buetow/>

The mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, 'single' (or 'half') mask and 'double' (or 'full') mask. Dogs without a mask are called 'plain-faced'. Any of these are correct according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.<ref name=ANKC/>
[[File:Australian Catle Dog Silverbarn's Paavo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cattle Dog head with an alert expression|A Cattle Dog with a single mask shows the breed's typical alert expression.]]

====Tail====
The breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian [[Kennel Club|kennel clubs]] specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, [[Docking (dog)|un-docked]] tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve  at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.<ref name =ANKC/> 

In the US, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 145</ref> The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the [[Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog]], a square-bodied dog born with a naturally 'bobbed' tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.<ref name = Stumpy>{{Cite web| title = The Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog: A Breed Of Its Own | work = Wolf Web | publisher = Australian Cattle Dog Social Club of North Queensland | url = http://www.wolfweb.com.au/acd/stcd.html | accessdate = 28 September 2011}}</ref>

===Temperament===
Like many [[working dogs]], the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels and an active mind. The breed ranks 10th in [[Stanley Coren|Stanley Coren's]] ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability.<ref name=Coren>Coren (1995), p. 182</ref> The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in [[dog sports]], [[Dog tricks|learning tricks]], or other activities that engage its body and mind.<ref name = Robertson>Robertson (1990), p. 14</ref>

When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is a happy, affectionate, and playful pet.<ref name = "Robertson"/> However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent [[guard dog]] when trained for this task, however it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal.<ref name = Lowell>Lowell (1990), p. 166</ref>  By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding.<ref name=Lithgow>Lithgow (2001), pp. 5<U+2013>6, 25<U+2013>28</ref> The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. Aggression in an Australian Cattle Dog is more likely to be directed at strangers than owners or other dogs,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first= Deborah L.|coauthors = Hsu,Yuying; Serpell, James A.|date=December 2008|title=Breed differences in canine aggression|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=114|issue=3<U+2013>4|pages=441<U+2013>460| doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2008.04.006}}</ref> though it will bite if treated harshly.<ref name = "Lowell"/>

While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration; however, research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dehasse, Joel|year=1994|url= http://www.nwk9.com/dehasse_pupdev.htm|title= Sensory, emotional, and social development of the young dog|journal=The Bulletin for Veterinary Clinical Ethology|volume=2|issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=6<U+2013>29}}</ref> It responds well to familiar dogs. However, when multiple dogs are present, establishing a [[pecking order]] can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.<ref name = "Lowell"/>

==As pets==

===Grooming===
Known as a 'wash and wear' dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round [[Moulting |shedder]] but [[blowing the coat|blows its coat]] once a year (twice in the case of [[Entire (animal)|intact females]]) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.<ref name = Beauchamp>Beauchamp (1997), pp. 67, 77</ref>

===Training===
In Katherine Buetow<U+2019>s guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, [[Ian Dunbar]] makes the point that while people think of [[dog training]] as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll-over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed.<ref name ="Buetow2">Buetow (1998), pp. 98<U+2013>127</ref> Like other [[Working dog|working breeds]], the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog.<ref name = "Schwartz"/> Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment.<ref name=Lithgow/> Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors.<ref name = "Schwartz">Schwartz (2009), pp. 78<U+2013>102</ref> The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.<ref name = Stockman>Stockman (2002), p. 102</ref>

===Activities===
[[File:Acd agility.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Cattle Dog jumps over a hurdle|The breed is well suited for agility trials.]]

The Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other [[herding dog]] breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities <U+2013> which might not please the owner. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.<ref name = "Robertson"/> 

[[Kennel club]]-sponsored [[herding]] trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while [[sheepdog trials]] are more suited to the <U+2018>eye<U+2019> breeds such as the [[Border Collie]] and [[Australian Kelpie]]. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as 'stay', 'get it' and 'that'll do' are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.<ref>{{cite web | title = Getting Started in Herding| publisher=American Kennel Club| url = http://www.akc.org/events/herding/getting_started.cfm | accessdate = 28 December 2009}}</ref> 

The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances, and may be the best breed in the world for this work.<ref name=Lithgow/> However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.<ref name=Lithgow/> 

Among the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is [[dog agility]]. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.<ref>Simmons-Moake (1992), pp. 1<U+2013>8</ref> 
[[File:Australian Cattle Dog Herding.jpg|thumb|alt=A cattle dog herding sheep in a pen|Australian Cattle Dogs were bred to drive cattle, but are also used to herd sheep.]]
The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in [[obedience trial|obedience competition]]. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. [[Rally obedience]] offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.<ref name=Holmes>Holmes (1993), pp. 132<U+2013>155</ref>

Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including [[weight pulling]], [[flyball]] and [[schutzhund]].<ref name = Shaffer>Shaffer (1984), p. 53</ref> The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as [[canicross]], [[disc dog]], and [[skijoring]] or [[bikejoring]]. It is an effective [[hiking]] companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side.<ref name=Holmes/> Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers.<ref name=Hamilton>Hamilton-Wilkes (1982), p. 77</ref> It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.<ref name=Coren>{{Cite book | last = Coren| first = Stanley| title = Why We Love the Dogs We Do| publisher=The Free Press| year = 1998| location = New York, NY | isbn = 068485502X}}</ref> 

The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are [[therapy dog]]s,<ref name = Shaffer/> some work for customs agencies in [[Detection dog|drug detection]], some as [[police dog]]s,<ref name=Holmes/> and others herd pest animals, such as [[Canada Goose|geese]], for city or state agencies.<ref name=hazing>{{Cite journal| last = Woodruff | first =Roger A.| last2 = Green| first2 = Jeffrey S. | title = Livestock herding dogs: a unique application for wildlife damage management | journal = Great Plains Wildlife Damage Control Workshop Proceedings| publisher = Noble Foundation| location = April 10<U+2013>13, Ardmore, OK | volume = 12 | pages = 43<U+2013>45 | year = 1995}}</ref>

===Common health problems===
[[File:Cattle Dog with injured leg.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Blue Cattle dog with a bandage on its right hind-leg|Cattle Dogs have more injuries than illnesses.]] 
The Australian Cattle Dog carries [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[piebald]] [[allele]]s that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Heredity|hereditary]] deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Strain, George M.|date=January 2004|pmid=14623147|title=Deafness prevalence and pigmentation and gender associations in dog breeds at risk|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=167|issue=1|pages=23<U+2013>32|doi=10.1016/S1090-0233(03)00104-7}}</ref> Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.<ref>{{cite web|author=Strain, George M.|date=23 June 2004|url=http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/incidenc.htm|title=Breed-Specific Deafness Prevalence In Dogs|publisher=Louisiana State University |accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref>

The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by [[progressive retinal atrophy]]. It has the most common form, Progressive Rod/Cone Degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]] in the [[retina]] of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an [[autosome|autosomal recessive trait]] and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.<ref>{{cite web |last=Petersen-Jones |first=Simon M. |title=Progressive Retinal Atrophy: an overview |work=Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association |year=2003 |url=http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6687&O=Generic |accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref> 

[[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]] is not common in the breed,<ref name=Beauchamp/> although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their [[Selective breeding|breeding stock]] tested.

==History==
===In Australia===
[[File:Front drive up to Trackson's property.jpg|thumb|alt=Blue Cattle Dog walking down a driveway ahead of two boys with a toy wagon, and a man and a women in a horse-drawn cart, 1902| An early Australian Cattle Dog, photographed in 1902]]
George Hall and his family arrived in the [[New South Wales]] Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter Valley]], and had begun a northward expansion into the [[Liverpool Plains]], [[New England (Australia)|New England]] and [[Queensland]]. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced [[stock route]]s through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in [[Shrubland|scrub]].<ref>Clark (2003), p. 7</ref>

A [[droving]] dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the [[Old English Sheepdog]] type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in [[Northumberland]], his parents<U+2019> home county. At this time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a <U+2018>breed<U+2019> as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 9</ref>

Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with [[dingo]]es he had tamed and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the [[Halls Heeler]]s, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 15</ref>

[[File:Peaceful rural scene in South East Queensland.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Cattle dog walking beside a plough drawn by two horses|In 1900 Cattle Dogs were accustomed to horses.]]
By the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the ''Cattle Dog Club of Sydney'', a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term 'Australian Cattle Dog' to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's 'heelers', and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines.<ref name = Howard>Howard (1990), pp. 26<U+2013>28</ref> Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. [[Robert Kaleski]], of [[Moorebank, New South Wales|Moorebank]], a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote <U+201C>in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines<U+201D>.<ref>Kaleski (2005)</ref> This first [[breed standard]] for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.<ref name="ADB">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090530b.htm|title=Kaleski, Robert Lucian Stanislaus (1877<U+2013>1961) |last=Walsh|first=G. P.|year=2006|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref> 

Kaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions  in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 22</ref> Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] and [[Kelpie (dog)|Kelpie]] infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 23</ref> The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 25</ref> The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 24</ref> It is possible that there was some infusion of [[Bull Terrier]] but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 26</ref> Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated,<ref name = Howard/> resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed.  In recent years, [[information technology]] enabling the manipulation of large [[databases]] combined with advances in the understanding of canine [[genetics]] has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.<ref>Clark (2003), p. xii</ref>

Through the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of [[Booval, Queensland|Booval]], and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. When [[Agricultural show|Royal Shows]] resumed after World War II, Sydney exhibitors saw ''Little Logic'' offspring for the first time and these dogs and their sires' show record created a demand in New South Wales for ''Little Logic's'' lineage. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of ''Little Logic'' and his best known son, ''Logic Return''. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname 'Queensland Heeler'.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 54</ref>
 
The prominence of ''Little Logic'' and ''Logic Return'' in the [[pedigree (animal)|pedigrees]] of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, ''Wooleston Blue Jack'' is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.<ref>Clark (2003), p. 58</ref>

===In the US===

In the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a [[Napa, California]] cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during [[World War II]], had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his <U+2018>improved<U+2019> dogs to the US. Many US soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.<ref name=Ekman> {{Cite web| last = Ekman | first = Esther | title = Can An American Kennel Club Registration Save A Herding Breed? | work = Working/Herding Dogs | url = http://www.lassickennels.com/Agrihelp/wkhrdregistration.htm | accessdate = 30 December 2009}}</ref>

In the late 1950s a veterinarian in [[Santa Rosa, California]], Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher<U+2019>s dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in ''Western Horsemen'' stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including ''Oaklea Blue Ace'', ''Glen Iris Boomerang'' and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of [[Butler, Indiana]], registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.<ref name=Ekman/>

Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the "miscellaneous" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed.<ref name=Ekman/> In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia.<ref name=Ekman/> The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an 'American Cattle Dog', and all others would still be registered as 'Australian Cattle Dogs'.<ref name=Ekman/>

===In Canada===
The breed gained official recognition from the [[Canadian Kennel Club]] in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts.<ref name = Redhead>Redhead (1988), p. 116</ref> The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and [[lure coursing]]. At the end of 1980, ''Landmaster Carina'' was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.<ref name = Redhead>Redhead (1988), p. 116</ref>

===In the UK===
The first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, ''Lenthal Flinton'' and ''Lenthal Darlot'', followed in 1980 by ''Landmaster Darling Red'' in whelp.<ref name=Holmes/> ''Landmaster Darling Red'' was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from Holland, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding [[artificial insemination]], the UK [[gene pool]] was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category "Any Variety Not Separately Classified". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.<ref name=Holmes/>

==Cross breeds==
The [[Texas Heeler]] is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the [[Australian Shepherd]] that was first registered with the [[Animal Research Foundation (ARF)]] in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without [[Breed registry|papers]] as 'Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the [[Australian Shepherd]].<ref name ="ARF">{{Cite journal | last = Walker |first = Al | title = Texas Heeler | journal=Stodghill's Animal Research Foundation Magazine | volume = 53 | url = http://www.animalresearchfoundation.com/texas_heeler.htm | year = 1978}}</ref> Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle,<ref name="Renna">Renna (2009), p. 65</ref> the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in [[dog sports]]. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.
