In the [[Marvel Comics Multiverse]], '''Earth-98''' or '''Earth 98''' is similar to [[Earth-616]] which is a primary home to superheroes seen in canonical Marvel comic books except that they began their careers during their debuts on the comic book with a publication date rather than beginning their career "ten to fifteen years ago" (eg. [[Spider-Man]] began his adventures in 1962 instead of 199?). This Earth is sometimes referred to as "Earth-1961", a reference to the year [[Fantastic Four]] made its comic debut. This Earth was designated as '''Earth-98''' in ''The [[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Alternate Universes 2005''

The timeline between 1961 to 1973 has similar dating points until the events of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 1) #121-122 in which [[Spider-Man]] "vanishes" following the deaths of [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Green Goblin]] rather than remaining active like his Earth-616 counterpart. Note that the events of "Onslaught" and the emerging of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] is part of Earth-98 continuity but is date outside of the 1961-1973 timescale.

==Captain America==
[[Captain America]] has the same history as his Earth-616 counterpart until he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of civilians in Oklahoma (presumably on April 19th, 1995 which is the date of [[Oklahoma City Bombing]]).

==Dr. Strange==
[[Dr. Strange]] is the same as his Earth-616 counterpart but has aged a little.

==Fantastic Four==
The [[Fantastic Four]] had similar adventures up until the time of [[Spider-Man]]'s "disappearance." After his vanishing, [[Human Torch]] married Crystal and gave birth to their son Cosmic Ray (presumably Ray Storm) and also had a daughter Luna (similar to her Earth-616 counterpart except that she nicknamed herself "Spike"). [[Franklin Richards]] (who then becomes "Zero Man") then married Zawadi of Wakanda and had a daughter N'Yami. 

However, Reed Richards and Ben Grimm had fought in the [[World War II|Second World War]], of which the events were depicted in ''[[Nick Fury|Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]]''.

==Frightful Four==
This Team comprised of Wizard, Blastaar, Quicksand and the mysterious villain known as Hooded Haunt and still foes of Fantastic Four.

==Hulk==
[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] is similar to his Earth-616 counterpart until he died in 1996 of a heart attack at the age of 70 years old.

==Spider-Man==
[[Spider-Man]] is similar to his Earth-616 counterpart except that he abandoned his career following the deaths of [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Green Goblin]], which never happened in Earth-616, and disappeared without a trace.

==Thor==
[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is similar to his Earth-616 Counterpart and presumably still a member of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].

==Wolverine==
[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] is similar to his Earth-616 counterpart and remained active as [[X-Men]] member.

==Early Sightings of Earth-98==
Earth-98 is somehow first seen in Marvel Comics from 1961 to 1973 as well as comic books in which events taken place in "real time" beyond 1973 (eg. [[Marvels]] presumably takes place on Earth-98) and comic books involving Reed Richards and Ben Grimm's World War II background (which never took place on Earth-616). Captain America's revival in Avengers (vol. 1) #4 also seems to take place on this Earth.
