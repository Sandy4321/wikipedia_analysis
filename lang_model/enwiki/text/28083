'''Wang Yun''' ([[137]] &ndash; [[192]]) was the Minister of the Masses under [[Emperor Xian of Han China|Emperor Xian]], the last emperor of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]]. During Wang Yun's time, the emperors were mere puppets under the power of eunuchs and warlords. In 192, Wang Yun plotted and successfully staged [[L<U+00FC> Bu]]'s assassination of [[Dong Zhuo]], the warlord in power. However, Dong Zhuo's former subjects soon led a coup, in which Wang Yun along with most of his family were executed.

In the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' Wang Yun was the adoptive father of the possibly fictional [[Diao Chan]], whom he used to seduce both Dong Zhuo and L<U+00FC> Bu. The subsequent rift that arose between the foster father and son eventually saw the death of Dong Zhuo by the hands of L<U+00FC> Bu.

==Life==

According to [[Book of Later Han]], Wang Yun came from Qi county (<U+7941><U+53BF>, south of present day [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]]). His family had many members who had served as administrative officials in the regional government for generations. Wang Yun himself was an official at the age of 19, and became the Inspector of [[Yuzhou (region)|Yuzhou]] (<U+8C6B><U+5DDE><U+523A><U+53F2>) at the time of the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]]. However, later he failed in the power struggle with the eunuch [[Zhang Rang]]. He had to abandon his position and hide himself in countryside. After the death of Zhang Rang, warlord [[He Jin]] came into power, and Wang Yun was promoted to the Gentleman of the Household and later to the Intendant of Henan (<U+6CB3><U+5357><U+5C39>). 

In 190, the capital [[Luoyang]] fell into chaos following the death of He Jin and a bloody clash between the powerful eunuch faction and government officials. [[Dong Zhuo]], a warlord from [[Wester Liang (region)|Liangzhou]] (<U+51C9><U+5DDE>) managed to take control of the situation and eventually placed in the throne a puppet emperor whom he held in his power. At the end of the eunuch riot era, Wang Yun was the Minister over the Masses (<U+53F8><U+5F92>) and the Director of Imperial Secretariat (<U+5C1A><U+4E66><U+4EE4>).

Dong Zhuo's subsequent tyrannical and cruel behavior aroused the wrath of many. Wang Yun then colluded with several other court officials in a plot to assassinate Dong Zhuo. The plan received a huge boost when the conspirators managed to recruit the help of Dong Zhuo's own foster son [[L<U+00FC> Bu]]. Bringing along a dozen men, L<U+00FC> Bu cornered Dong Zhuo outside the palace gate and delivered the fatal blow himself.

After the death of Dong Zhuo, rumors spread that the court intended to execute all his former troops from Liangzhou. When a royal decree of pardon was not issued, former subjects of Dong Zhuo, [[Li Jue]] and [[Guo Si]], led a coup and defeated L<U+00FC> Bu.

Before L<U+00FC> Bu escaped the capital, he sought out Wang Yun and asked the minister to join him. However, Wang Yun refused to leave the young emperor behind. The rebels soon seized Wang Yun along with many of his family members, who were then executed openly in the city center. Many of his brother's family managed to escape, and one of them, his nephew [[Wang Ling]], was a Grand Commandant under [[Cao Cao]].

==Wang Yun in Romance of the Three Kingdoms==

The ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[historical novel]] by [[Luo Guanzhong]], was a romanticization of the events that occurred before and during the [[Three Kingdoms Period]]. Luo Guanzhong delineated an elaborate and cunning scheme for Wang Yun's plot to eliminate [[Dong Zhuo]]. It involved two strategems from the ''[[Thirty-Six Strategies]]'': the Strategem of Beautiful Women (<U+7F8E><U+4EBA><U+8BA1>) and the Strategem of Combining Tactics (<U+8FDE><U+73AF><U+8BA1>).

In Chapter 8, Wang Yun was contemplating a plot to assassinate Dong Zhuo late one night when he heard a girl grieving in his garden. Tracing the sound, he found [[Diao Chan]], a song girl who was brought up in his household but whom he had been treating like his own daughter. An idea then struck Wang Yun to use Diao Chan to plant the seed of dissension between Dong Zhuo and his foster son [[L<U+00FC> Bu]].

Inviting L<U+00FC> Bu over one night, Wang Yun asked Diao Chan to serve wine to the guest. L<U+00FC> Bu was immediately seized by the girl's beauty. Well aware of this, Wang Yun then promised to marry Diao Chan to the mighty warrior.

A few days later, however, Wang Yun laid a feast for Dong Zhuo and repeated the feat. Like L<U+00FC> Bu, Dong Zhuo could not lift his eyes off Diao Chan, who also displayed her prowess in song and dance. Dong Zhuo then brought Diao Chan home and made her his concubine.

When L<U+00FC> Bu heard this the next morning, he headed for Dong Zhuo's bedroom and peeped in through the window. There he saw Diao Chan sitting up grooming her hair while Dong Zhuo was still asleep. Aware of L<U+00FC> Bu's presence, Diao Chan then put up a sorrowful expression and pretended to wipe tears off her eyes with a handkerchief.

A similar incident recurred about a month later, but this time Dong Zhuo woke up in time to see L<U+00FC> Bu staring fixedly at Diao Chan. L<U+00FC> Bu was then shoved out and forbidden to come into the house.

Then one day, while Dong Zhuo was holding a conversation with [[Emperor Xian of Han China|Emperor Xian]], L<U+00FC> Bu stole to his foster father's residence and met with Diao Chan in the Fengyi Pavilion (<U+51E4><U+4EEA><U+4EAD>). Weeping, Diao Chan pled with L<U+00FC> Bu to rescue her from Dong Zhuo. Placing his halberd aside, L<U+00FC> Bu held Diao Chan in his arms and comforted her with words.

Right then, Dong Zhuo returned to find the duo in the pavilion. The startled L<U+00FC> Bu turned to flee. Dong Zhuo grabbed the halberd and gave chase. Being too obese, Dong Zhuo could not catch up with the agile L<U+00FC> Bu. He then hurled the halberd at L<U+00FC> Bu but the latter fended it off and got away.

After he had calmed down, Dong Zhuo took the cousel of his advisor [[Li Ru]] and decided to marry Diao Chan to L<U+00FC> Bu in order to consolidate support from the powerful warrior. When Dong Zhuo told Diao Chan of the plan, however, she wailed and threatened to kill herself. Dong Zhuo then gave up the idea.

On the other hand, L<U+00FC> Bu was becoming increasingly displeased with Dong Zhuo. This displeasure was further heightened by Wang Yun, who suggested subtly that L<U+00FC> Bu take over Dong Zhuo. L<U+00FC> Bu attempted weakly to argue for Dong Zhuo's paternal relationship to himself, but Wang Yun dismissed it, saying, "His name is Dong and yours is L<U+00FC>. Where was the paternal feeling when he threw the halberd at you?" Upon hearing this, L<U+00FC> Bu made up his mind to kill Dong Zhuo.

After Dong Zhuo's death, his former subjects [[Li Jue]] and [[Guo Si]] led a coup and surrounded Emperor Xian and Wang Yun at the Xuanping Gate (<U+5BA3><U+5E73><U+95E8>). To ensure the safety of the emperor, Wang Yun then gave himself up to the rebel leaders, who jointly slayed him.
