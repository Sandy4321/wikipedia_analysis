A '''Virtual arcade''' is an extension of an Arcade game emulator. With some setup, the player can view all the [[ROM image|ROM]]s supported by the Virtual Arcade as actual [[Arcade machines]]. The most commonly used emulator and Virtual Arcade software is [[MAME]] and 3D Arcade. Most common Virtual Arcades can not play more than one [[ROM image|ROM]] at a time which makes it near impossible to play a game that requires the player to run two ROMs at once. Most Virtual Arcades also allow you to add new games, or customize the arcade.
