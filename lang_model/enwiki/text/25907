'''Arbogast & Bastian''' (also '''A&B Meats''') was the name of a [[slaughterhouse]] and meat packing plant located in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].   Once a national leader in [[pig|hog]] slaughtering, the company had the capacity to process most of the 850,000 hogs raised annually in Pennsylvania for slaughtering.<ref name="buyer">{{Citation |last=Clark | first=John| title=A&B Complex Sale Expected Holiday Hair President Reported Buyer. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=A.01 | date=February 20, 1985}}</ref>  In its heyday, Arbogast & Bastian  slaughtered an average of 4,000 hogs daily.<ref name="riverfront">{{Citation |last=Hernan | first=Michael| title=A&B May Grace Riverfront. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=B.01 | date=January 17, 1990}}</ref>

Arbogast & Bastian, which was founded in 1887, operated for nearly one hundred years before filing for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy in 1984, citing [[cash flow]] issues brought about by market turmoil and labor disputes.  The company filed [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy the following year.

With the sole exception of the company's offices, the Arbogast & Bastian plant was demolished in the late 1990s.  These surviving offices were later incorporated into the [[America On Wheels]] museum, which was opened on the site of the former Arbogast & Bastian plant in 2008.

The Arbogast & Bastian Company was founded in 1887 by  Wilson Arbogast and Morris Clinton Bastian.  Arbogast, who was born in [[Freeburg, Pennsylvania|Freeburg]], [[Snyder County, Pennsylvania|Snyder County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1851, was a school teacher by training who entered the wholesale provisioning business in the early 1880s in [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey|Phillipsburg]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>Roberts, p. 17.</ref>  Bastian, who was born in [[Lower Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], Pennsylvania, in 1859, operated a general store in Allentown.<ref>Roberts, p. 65.</ref>  

The two partners built a two story building and [[stable]] at 25 Hamilton Street in Allentown, purchased two horses, and started supplying provisions and [[lard]] to local businesses and distributors.  They used their building as a [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke house]], and offered "freshly-smoked" hams and bacon that were prepared using meat purchased ready-cured from other suppliers.  Ready-cured meat is that which, after slaughter and [[butcher]]y, has been treated by [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] in order to prevent the growth of bacteria and to reduce the opportunity for [[botulism]] to grow, allowing for much safer transport and storage.  This grew into a strong business for Arbogast & Bastian, as previously these goods had to be imported from larger cities, such as [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]], and suffered in freshness and quality because of the additional time and handling required to get the finished product to Allentown.<ref name="historic240">''Historic'', p. 240.</ref>

In 1890, the company added a hog slaughtering department, in order to offer fresh pork and sausages to their customers.  The capacity of the plant increased from 150 hogs per week at inception, to over 1,500 hogs per week in 1905.<ref name="historic240"/>  Pork brands offered included "Pure Home Rendered Lard" and "Old Dutch" hams and bacon.<ref name="historic240"/>  With their venture in pork successful, Arbogast & Bastian soon expanded in a similar manner with [[beef]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], and [[mutton]], first by purchasing ready-cured meat from suppliers in the West to learn the trade, then by building a full-scale [[slaughterhouse|abbatoir]] and cold-storage facilities on-site.  By 1905, the company was processing over 150 head of cattle, and a similar number of lambs and sheep, weekly.<ref name="historic241">''Historic'', p. 241.</ref>

Arbogast & Bastian Company was formally incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with $200,000 in capital (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000|1902|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}} dollars, adjusted for inflation),{{Inflation-fn|US}} on June 19, 1902.<ref>''List'', p. 98.</ref>  The additional capital raised by the corporation was used to purchase more land and to build larger [[refrigeration]] facilities and a [[power station|power plant]].  By 1905, Arbogast & Bastian's revenues exceeded $1 million per year (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1905|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}} dollars, adjusted for inflation.)<ref name="historic241"/>{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The large Arbogast & Bastian facility now occupied a prominent location at Hamilton and Front streets in Allentown, along the [[Lehigh River]].  The facility received livestock and transported goods via tracks run to the plant by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]].  On July 14, 1905, a large fire destroyed the original Arbogast & Bastian plant and the company rebuilt a larger, more modern facility.<ref name="thrived">{{Citation |last=Kelly | first=Jim |title=A&B Meats Thrived In The Days Before Cholesterol. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=B.02 | date=May 22, 1998}}</ref> It was the first reinforced [[concrete]] meat packing plant in the United States.<ref name="Lesley">Lesley, p. 35.</ref>  The Arbogast & Bastian plant, which allowed for more sanitary and safer operations, was designed and built in direct response to the unsanitary conditions in Chicago's meat packing plants<ref name="Lesley"/> exposed by [[Upton Sinclair]] in his book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', which led to the passage of the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]].

During [[World War II]], 70&nbsp;percent of Arbogast & Bastian's output went to the [[United States armed forces]] and through the [[Lend-Lease]] program to the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Republic of China|China]], [[Free France|France]] and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]].<ref name="thrived"/>  By 1973, Arbogast & Bastian had 700 employees processing 160 million pounds (73 million kg) of meat a year, and the company had the capacity to butcher 7,200 hogs and 1,000 cattle a week.<ref name="thrived"/>

Arbogast & Bastian filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] on May 11, 1984, citing [[cash flow]] issues brought about by "two years of turbulent market conditions in the pork industry," a labor dispute with the [[Teamsters]] [[trade union|labor union]] and the recent shutdown of A&B's slaughtering operations.<ref name="chapter11">{{Citation |last=Clark | first=John |title=A&B Seeks More Time To Pay Bills. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=W.03 | date=May 12, 1984}}</ref>  The bankruptcy was immediately triggered because one of the company's customers had issued a stop-payment on $800,000 worth of checks paid to Arbogast & Bastian.<ref name="buyer"/>  The firm's financial woes were further complicated by four large meat packing companies - Pork Cutters, Inc., Rotches Pork Packers, Inc., Otto Doerrer and Son, Inc. and Crissman, Inc. - who collectively failed to pay for nearly $5 million worth of pork carcasses and meat products purchased from Arbogast & Bastian in 1983 and 1984, according to charges made by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].<ref name="buyer"/><ref name="packers">{{Citation |title=4 Meat Packers Accused Of Failing To Pay A&B. | newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] | pages=B.08 | date=December 19, 1984}}</ref>   In total, about 380 workers lost their jobs.<ref name="closed">{{Citation |last=Shape | first=Bob |title=A.&.B.
