'''Juan Schiaretti''' (born June 19, 1949 in [[Talleres]], [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]]), known as 'El Gringo', is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Justicialist Party]] politician and accountant. He is the governor of the [[provinces of Argentina|Province]] of [[C<U+00F3>rdoba Province (Argentina)|C<U+00F3>rdoba]].

Schiaretti's father was Dante Schiaretti, a railway worker and [[Peronism|Peronist]] activist descended from immigrants from [[Parma]]. He was imprisoned after the military coup which toppled [[Juan Domingo Per<U+00F3>n|Per<U+00F3>n]] in 1955. His mother is Julia <U+00C1>lamo, a housewife. Schiaretti studied at the Escuela P<U+00FA>blica Nacional 95, in the Talleres Oeste neighbourhood, then at the Liceo Militar General Paz, which he entered at eleven and left with the gold medal for best academic achievement of his group (1961 to 1965). He studied for his degree in the Economic Sciences Faculty of the [[National University of C<U+00F3>rdoba]], where he qualified as a public accountant aged 21. He married a fellow political activist and had two children.

In 1975, Schiaretti was threatened by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]] and moved with his family to [[Neuqu<U+00E9>n]]. The military coup of 1976 forced him into exile in [[Brazil]]. He worked as a salesman then found work as an administrative assistant at [[Fiat]] in [[Belo Horizonte]]. He stayed with the company and rose to be deputy director of administration.

In 1984, Schiaretti returned to Argentina and separated from his wife. He worked in politics and was sub-secretary of [[Latin America]]n Integration in the Ministry of International Relations under [[Carlos Menem|President Menem]] between 1989 and 1991, then Secretary of Industry and Commerce in the Ministry of Economy between 1991 and 1993, during the same administration. He was appointed federal conservator of the Province of Santiago del Estero from 1993 to 1995, following the removal of the province's governor, and was then was elected deputy for C<U+00F3>rdoba Province in the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]], serving from 1995 to 1997. He was provincial minister of production in C<U+00F3>rdoba from 1999 to 2001, then returned as Deputy for the province from 2001 to 2002 before becoming provincial Minister of Production and Finances 2002-03.

In 2003, Schiaretti was elected vice-governor of his province with [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel de la Sota]] as governor. In 2007, upon de la Sota's retirement, Schiaretti stood for the governorship for the Justicialist Party in the Union for C<U+00F3>rdoba Coalition, with [[H<U+00E9>ctor Campana|H<U+00E9>ctor 'Pichi' Campana]] (a former basketball player and [[Alliance New Front|New Party]] Councillor who had originally intended to stand in his own right). His principal opponent was the Mayor of C<U+00F3>rdoba, [[Luis Juez]] and Schiaretti trailed in the polls for some time. [[Argentine general election, 2007|In the 2007 election]], there were claims of electoral fraud and the result went to recounts and was finally declared for Schiaretti by the electoral court of the province.

Following the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]], Schiaretti became distanced from the national Peronist leadership of President [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner]] and [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]]. Ahead of the [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|legislative elections]] of June 2009, he announced he would be running his own list for the national Congress, headed by [[Eduardo Mondino]], in opposition to the Kirchners' [[Front for Victory]].<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1116498&pid=6187398&toi=6259 Se agrava la tensi<U+00F3>n entre el Gobierno y Schiaretti], ''[[La Naci<U+00F3>n]]'', 8 April 2009.
