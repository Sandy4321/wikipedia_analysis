The '''French ironclad ''Atalante''''' was a wooden-hulled armored [[corvette]] built for the [[French Navy]] in the mid-1860s. She played a minor role in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, bombarded Vietnamese forts during the [[Battle of Thuan An]] in 1884 and participated in the [[Sino-French War]] of 1884<U+2013>85. ''Atalante'' was reduced to reserve in Saigon in 1885 and sank there two years later after having been condemned.

==Design and description==
The {{sclass|Alma|ironclad}}s were designed as a improved version of the {{ship|French ironclad|Belliqueuse}} suitable for foreign deployments. Unlike their predecessor the ''Alma''-class ships were true [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclads]] as they were fitted with armored transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.<ref name=d26>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 26</ref> Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced [[Naval ram|ram]].<ref name=g1>Gardiner, p. 302</ref>

''Atalante'' measured {{convert|68.78|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.2|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|6.56|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|3825|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=d26/> Her crew numbered 316 officers and men.<ref name=g1/>

===Propulsion===
The ship had a single horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|return connecting-rod steam engine]] driving a single propeller. Her engine was powered by four oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref name=g1/> On [[sea trial]]s the engine produced {{convert|1640|ihp}} and the ship reached {{convert|11.56|kn}}.<ref name=d26/> ''Atalante'' carried {{convert|250|MT|LT}}<ref name=g1/> of coal which allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|1460|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She was [[barque]]-rigged and had a sail area of {{convert|1338|sqm|sqft|sp=us}}.<ref name=d26/>

===Armament===
''Atalante'' mounted her four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 [[breech-loading]] guns in the central battery on the battery deck. The other two 194-millimeter guns were mounted in [[barbettes]] on the upper deck, [[sponson]]ed out over the sides of the ship. The four {{convert|120|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns were also mounted on the upper deck.<ref name=d27/> She may have exchanged her Mle 1864 guns for Mle 1870 guns. The [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] shell of the 20-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mle 1870 gun weighed {{convert|165.3|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|7.83|LT|t}}. The gun fired its shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1739|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|12.5|in}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the muzzle. The guns could fire both [[Round shot|solid shot]] and [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shells]].<ref>Brassey, p. 477</ref>

===Armor===
''Atalante'' had a complete {{convert|150|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} [[wrought iron]] waterline [[Belt armor|belt]], approximately {{convert|2.4|m|ft|sp=us|1}} high. The sides of the battery itself were armored with {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of wrought iron and the ends of the battery were closed by bulkheads of the same thickness. The barbette armor was {{convert|100|mm|in|sp=us}} thick, backed by {{convert|240|mm|in|sp=us}} of wood.<ref name=d27>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 27</ref> The unarmored portions of her sides were protected by {{convert|15|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} iron plates.<ref name=g1/>

==Service==
''Atalante'' was laid down at [[Cherbourg]] in June 1865 and launched on 12 April 1867. Her [[sea trial]]s began on 1 April 1869 and she joined the reserve at [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 11 July 1869. ''Atalante'' was commissioned on 23 February 1870 and was initially assigned to the Evolutionary Squadron before transferring to the Northern Squadron in July 1870 at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The squadron was ordered to lift its blockade of the Prussian [[North Sea]] ports on 16 September and return to Cherbourg.<ref name=d30>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1975, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> ''Atalante'' went back into reserve in November 1870, but she was recommissioned the following year.<ref name=d29>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac 1976, p. 29</ref>

She was named as the [[flagship]] of the Pacific Squadron on 1 July 1872 under command of Rear Admiral Baron Roussin. On 14 August ''Atalante'' sailed from [[Lorient]] for the Pacific and did not return until 27 February 1874. She was placed into reserve upon her arrival, but was recommissioned on 28 December 1875 as the flagship of the China Squadron under Rear Admiral Veron. She departed Lorient on 10 January 1876, but returned on 16 May 1878. The ship spent the next four years in reserve before being recommissioned on 3 July 1882 for service with the [[Cochinchina]] Division ({{lang-fr|division navale de Cochinchine}}).<ref name=d29/>

''Atalante'' was transferred to the new Tonkin Coast Division ({{lang-fr|division navale des c<U+00F4>tes du Tonkin}}) when it was formed in 1883. During 18<U+2013>21 August 1883 she participated in the [[Battle of Thuan An]]. This was an attack by the French on the forts defending the mouth of the [[Perfume River]], leading to the [[Vietnam]]ese capital of [[Hu<U+1EBF>]] in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese government. ''Atalante'' was assigned to bombard the North Fort by the French commander, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Am<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>e Courbet]]. After two days of bombardment a landing party from the ship captured the fort.<ref name=d29/> [[Ensign]] ({{lang-fr|Enseigne de vaisseau}}) Louis-Marie-Julien Viaud, who was aboard the ''Atalante'' during the battle and participated in the landing, wrote several articles graphically describing his experiences that were published in the newspaper [[Le Figaro]] under the pen-name of [[Pierre Loti]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Berrong|first=Richard M.|title=In Love With a Handsome Sailor: The Emergence of Gay Identity and the Novels of Pierre Loti|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eNWyOe7wQMgC&pg=PA267&dq=Loti+Figaro+Thuan+An|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0-8020-3695-3|page=267}}</ref>

The ship was assigned to the [[Far East Squadron]] ({{lang-fr|escadre de l'Extr<U+00EA>me-Orient}}) under Admiral Courbet when it was formed by the amalgamation of the Tonkin Coast and Far Eastern Divisions in June 1884 in preparation for the [[Sino-French War]] of 1884<U+2013>85.<ref name=d29/> In early September 1884 ''Atalante'' was in Hu<U+1EBF>,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E3D7163AEF33A25754C0A96F9C94659FD7CF|title=French Forces Resting|date=7 September 1884|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 July 2010|location=New York}}</ref> but she carried Admiral Courbet to [[Keelung]] on 23 September.<ref name=d29/> The ship was [[paid off]] into reserve in [[Saigon]] in 1885 and condemned two years later. She fell into such a state of disrepair that "she [[wikt:founder|foundered]] one night and gradually sank into the mud."<ref name=d29/>
