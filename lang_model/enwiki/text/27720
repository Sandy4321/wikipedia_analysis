'''Santiago de las Vegas''' is a city in [[Havana Province]], [[Cuba]], located {{mi to km|12}} south of [[Havana]]. As of the year 2000, the population was 22,000. The Cuban government maintains an agricultural experiment station, as well as a meteorology center in the city.

==History==
The first settlement dates from [[1683]] when [[tobacco]] farmers settled on the lands of the ranches in S<U+00F3>calo Hondo, [[Managua]], [[Bejucal]] and [[La Chorrera]], then  under the jurisdiction of the [[Compostela]] bishop.<ref name=guije>{{Cite web|url= http://www.guije.com/pueblo/santiagov/index.htm |title=La Ciudad de Santiago de las Vegas|author=Guije.com|accessdate=2007-10-08}} {{Es icon}}</ref> The population grew quickly and in 1694 the first chuch was built. On June 18, 1725, the settlement was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as the town of ''Santiago de Compostela de las Vegas'' by royal certificate and was granted an extensive [[jurisdictional]] [[demarcation]] to the town. This marked the growth of its political and economic importance. 

In 1824, the town was declared a city, allowing their people to raise a statue dedicated to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[King Ferdinand VII]], placed at the Recreo Square. In 1831, the monarch corresponded by granting the city with the title of Faithful and Very Illustrious City Council.

In 1836, a government land ownership was created for the city, but in 1840 was instead awarded to [[Bejucal]]; however, it was returned again to Santiago de las Vegas in 1845. The city's church was completed in 1800; one of its towers was destroyed by a hurricane in 1846. The cemetery was built in 1814 and closed in 1895 to use the new one built at that times. In 1911 the ''Consistorial House'' was built. 

The population grew from 3300 in 1861 to almost 11,000 in 1953.

Santiago de las Vegas lost its municipality ststus in 1976 under the new Political-Administrative Division created by the government of [[Fidel Castro]], and is now part of the new [[municipality]] of [[Boyeros]], thus being amalgamated into the City of [[Havana]]. Today, Santiago de las Vegas languishes from the beautiful town it used to be.

== Commerce and Business ==

[[Transportation]] is one of the primary industries for the city. Geographically located between the increasingly greater [[metropolitan]] zones of the island and the rural region to the south and southwest of the province of [[Havana]], it served as a distribution point of numerous passengers between these two regions. Its bus station was a title branch of the National Bus Station in [[Havana]].

In addition, Santiago de las Vegas has two of the most important [[sanatorium]]s of [[Cuba]], the Psychiatric Hospital of Mazorra and the Sanatorium of El Rinc<U+00F3>n for leprosy patients. The presence of these facilities has also increased the necessity of lodging and restaurants in the community.

== Tourism ==

The opportunities that came the construction of the [[Jos<U+00E9> Mart<U+00ED> International Airport]] in [[Havana]] were important for the development of the tourist industry. Santiago de las Vegas has natural, historical, cultural and religious points of interest. These opportunities have created another possible source of wealth for the city and its surroundings, leading to the construction of hotels, restaurants, and other facilities and creating new jobs.
