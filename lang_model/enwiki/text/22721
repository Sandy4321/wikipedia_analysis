The '''Plesiosauria''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02CC>|p|l|i<U+02D0>|s|i|.|<U+0275>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|i|<U+0259>}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: <U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''plesios'', meaning 'near to' and [[Sauria]]) or '''plesiosaurs''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] or [[clade]] of [[Mesozoic]] [[marine reptile]]s (marine [[Sauropsida]]), belonging to the [[Sauropterygia]]. 

Plesiosaurs first appeared in the latest [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], possibly in the [[Rhaetian]] stage, about 205 million year ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Plesiosaur Directory|url=http://www.plesiosauria.com/evolution.php |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> They became especially common during the [[Jurassic]] Period, thriving until their disappearance due to the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] Period, about 66 million years ago. They had a worldwide oceanic distribution.

Plesiosaurs were among the first fossil reptiles discovered. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, scientists realised how distinctive their build was and they were named as a separate order in 1835. The first plesiosaurian genus, the eponymous ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'', was named in 1821. Since then over a hundred valid species have been described. In the early twenty-first century, the number of discoveries has increased, leading to an improved understanding of their anatomy, relationships and way of life.

Plesiosaurs had a flat, broad body and a short tail. Their limbs had evolved into four long flippers. These were powered by strong muscles attached to wide bony plates formed by the shoulder girdle and the pelvis. The flippers made a flying movement through the water. Plesiosaurs breathed air, were probably warm-blooded, and bore live young.

Plesiosaurs showed two main [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] types. Some species, with the "plesiosauromorph" build, had (sometimes extremely) long necks and small heads. They were relatively slow and caught small sea animals. Other species, some of them reaching a length of up to seventeen metres, had the "pliosauromorph" build with a short neck and a large head. They were [[apex predator]]s, fast hunters of large prey. The two types are related to the traditional strict division of the Plesiosauria into two suborders, the long-necked [[Plesiosauroidea]] and the short-neck [[Pliosauroidea]]. Modern research however, indicates that several "long-necked" groups might have had some short-necked members or vice-versa. Therefore the purely descriptive terms "plesiosauromorph" and "pliosauromorph" have been introduced, which do not imply a direct relationship. "Plesiosauroidea" and "Pliosauroidea" today have a more limited meaning. The term "plesiosaur" can be confusing. Properly it is used to refer to the Plesiosauria as a whole, but informally it is sometimes meant to indicate only the long-necked forms, the old Plesiosauroidea. 

== History of discovery ==
===Early finds===
[[File:Stukely plesiosaur.jpg|thumb|First published plesiosaur skeleton, 1719]]
Skeletal elements of plesiosaurs are among the first fossils of extinct reptiles recognised as such. In 1605, [[Richard Verstegen]] of [[Antwerp]] illustrated in his ''A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence'' plesiosaur vertebrae that he referred to fishes and saw as proof that [[Great Britain]] was once connected to the European continent.<ref>Richard Verstegan, 1605, ''A restitution of decayed intelligence or Nationum Origo'', R. Bruney, Antwerpen</ref> The Welshman [[Edward Lhuyd]] in his ''Lithophylacii Brittannici Ichnographia'' from 1699 also included depictions of plesiosaur vertebrae that again were considered fish vertebrae or ''Ichthyospondyli''.<ref>Lhuyd, E., 1699, ''Lithophylacii Brittannici Ichnographia, sive Lapidum aliorumque Fossilium Brittanicorum singulari figur<U+00E0> insignium'', Londen</ref> Other naturalists during the seventeenth century added plesiosaur remains to their collections, such as [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]]; these were only much later understood to be of a plesiosaurian nature and are today partly preserved in the [[Sedgwick Museum]].<ref name="Evans2010">Evans, M., 2010, "The roles played by museums, collections, and collectors in the early history of reptile palaeontology", pp. 5-31 in: Richard Moody, E. Buffetaut, D. Naish, D.M. Martill (eds). ''Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: A Historical Perspective''. Geological Society of London</ref>

In 1719, [[William Stukeley]] described a partial skeleton of a plesiosaur, which had been brought to his attention by the great-grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], [[Robert Darwin of Elston]]. The stone plate came from a quarry at [[Fulbeck]] and had been used, with the fossil at its underside, to reinforce the slope of a watering-hole in [[Elston]]. After the strange bones it contained had been discovered, it was displayed in the local vicarage as the remains of a sinner drowned in the [[Great Flood]]. Stukely affirmed its "[[diluvial]]" nature but understood it represented some sea creature, perhaps a crocodile or dolphin.<ref>Stukeley, W., 1719, "An account of the impression of the almost entire sceleton of a large animal in a very hard stone, lately presented the Royal Society, from Nottinghamshire", ''Philosophical Transactions'', '''30''': 963-968</ref> The specimen is today preserved in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], its inventory number being BMNH R.1330. It is the earliest discovered more or less complete fossil reptile skeleton in a museum collection. It can perhaps be referred to ''[[Plesiosaurus]] dolichodeirus''.<ref name="Evans2010"/>
[[File:Conybeare Plesiosaur 1824.jpg|left|thumb|As this illustration shows, Conybeare by 1824 had gained a basically correct understanding of plesiosaur anatomy]]
During the eighteenth century, the number of English plesiosaur discoveries rapidly increased, although these were all of a more or less fragmentary nature. Important collectors were the reverends [[William Mounsey (reverend)|William Mounsey]] and [[Baptist Noel Turner]], active in the [[Vale of Belvoir]], whose collections were in 1795 described by [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nicholls]] in the first part of his ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicestershire''.<ref>Nicholls, J., 1795, ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicestershire. Volume I'', John Nicholls, Londen</ref> One of Turner's partial plesiosaur skeletons is still preserved as specimen BMNH R.45 in the British Museum of Natural History; this is today referred to ''[[Thalassiodracon]]''.<ref name="Evans2010"/>
===''Plesiosaurus'' is named===
[[File:Mary Anning Plesiosaurus.jpg|thumb|upright|Complete ''Plesiosaurus'' skeleton recovered by the Annings in 1823]]
In the early nineteenth century plesiosaurs were still poorly known and their special build was not understood. No systematic distinction was made with [[ichthyosaurs]] so the fossils of one group were sometimes combined with those of the other to obtain a more complete specimen. In 1821, a partial skeleton discovered in the collection of Colonel [[Thomas James Birch]],<ref>Conybeare, W.D., 1822, "Additional notices on the fossil genera ''Ichthyosaurus'' and ''Plesiosaurus''", ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London'' '''2''': 103-123</ref> was described by [[William Conybeare]] and [[Henry Thomas De la Beche]], and recognised as representing a distinctive group. A new genus was named, ''[[Plesiosaurus]]''. The generic name was derived from the Greek <U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''pl<U+00E8>sios'', "closer to" and the Latinised ''saurus'', in the meaning of "saurian", to express that ''Plesiosaurus'' was in the [[Chain of Being]] more closely positioned to the [[Sauria]] than ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'' which had the form of a more lowly fish.<ref>De la Beche, H.T., and W.D. Conybeare, 1821, "Notice of the discovery of a new animal, forming a link between the Ichthyosaurus and crocodile, together with general remarks on the osteology of Ichthyosaurus", ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London'' '''5''': 559-594</ref> The name should thus be rather read as "approaching the Sauria" than as "near lizard". Parts of the specimen are still present in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]].<ref name="Evans2010"/>

Soon afterwards, the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] became much better known. In 1823, Thomas Clark reported an almost complete skull, probably belonging to ''Thalassiodracon'', which is now preserved by the [[British Geological Survey]] as specimen BGS GSM 26035.<ref name="Evans2010"/> The same year, commercial fossil collector [[Mary Anning]] and her family uncovered an almost complete skeleton at [[Lyme Regis]] in [[Dorset]], England, on what is today called the [[Jurassic Coast]]. It was acquired by the [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], who made it available to the geologist [[William Buckland]]. He in turn let it be described by Conybeare on 24 February 1824 in a lecture to the [[Geological Society of London]],<ref>Conybeare, W.D., 1824, "On the discovery of an almost perfect skeleton of the ''Plesiosaurus''", ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London'' '''2''': 382-389</ref> during the same meeting in which for the first time a dinosaur was named, ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. The two finds revealed the unique and bizarre build of the animals, in 1832 by Professor Buckland likened to "a sea serpent run through a turtle". In 1824, Conybeare also provided a [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] to ''Plesiosaurus'': ''dolichodeirus'', "longneck". In 1848, the skeleton was bought by the British Museum of Natural History and catalogued as specimen BMNH 22656.<ref name="Evans2010"/> When the lecture was published, Conybeare also named a second species: ''Plesiosaurus giganteus''. This was a short-necked form later assigned to the [[Pliosauroidea]].
[[File:Great Sea-Dragons.jpg|left|thumb|Hawkins' demonic plesiosaurs battling other sea-monsters in eternal darkness]]
Plesiosaurs became better known to the general public through two lavishly illustrated publications by the collector [[Thomas Hawkins (geologist)|Thomas Hawkins]]: ''Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri'' of 1834<ref>Hawkins, T.H., 1834, ''Memoirs on Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri; Extinct monsters of the ancient Earth'', Relfe and Fletcher, London, 58pp</ref> and ''The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons'' of 1840. Hawkins entertained a very idiosyncratic view of the animals, seeing them as monstrous creations of the devil, during a [[pre-Adamism|pre-Adamitic]] phase of history.<ref>Hawkins, T.H., 1840, ''The Book of the Great Sea-dragons, Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri, Gedolim Taninum of Moses. Extinct Monsters of the Ancient Earth'', W. Pickering, London, 27pp</ref> Hawkins eventually sold his valuable and attractively restored specimens to the British Museum of Natural History.

During the first half of the nineteenth century the number of plesiosaur finds steadily increased, especially through discoveries in the sea cliffs of Lyme Regis. Sir [[Richard Owen]] alone named nearly a hundred new species. The majority of their descriptions were, however, based on isolated bones, without sufficient diagnosis to be able to distinguish them from the other species that had previously been described. Many of the new species described at this time have subsequently been invalidated. The genus ''Plesiosaurus'' is particularly problematic as the majority of the new species were placed in it so that it became a [[wastebasket taxon]]. Gradually, other genera were named. Hawkins already created new genera, though these are no longer seen as valid. In 1841, Owen named ''[[Pliosaurus]] brachydeirus''. Its [[etymology]] referred to the earlier ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'' as it is derived from <U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+1FD6><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''pleios'', "more fully", reflecting that according to Owen it was closer to the Sauria than ''Plesiosaurus''. Its specific name means "with a short neck".<ref>Owen, R., 1841, "Description of some remains of a gigantic crocodilian saurian, probably marine, from the Lower Greensand at Hythe and of teeth from the same formation at Maidstone, referable to the genus ''Polyptychodon''", ''Proceedings of the Geologists<U+2019> Association'', '''3''': 449-452</ref> Later, the [[Pliosauridae]] were recognised as having a morphology fundamentally different from the plesiosaurids. A family [[Plesiosauridae]] had already been coined by [[John Edward Gray]] in 1825.<ref>John Edward Gray, 1825, "A Synopsis of the Genera of Reptiles and Amphibia, with a Description of some new Species", ''Annals of Philosophy (British Museum)'' '''10''': 193<U+2013>217</ref> In 1835, [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] named the order Plesiosauria itself.<ref>Blainville, H.M.D. de, 1835, "Description de quelques esp<U+00E8>ces de reptiles de la Californie, pr<U+00E9>c<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>e de l'analyse d'une syst<U+00E8>me g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale d'Erpetologie et d'Amphibiologie", ''Nouv. Annal. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris'', '''4''': 233<U+2013>296</ref>

===American discoveries===
In the second half of the nineteenth century, important finds were made outside of England. This included some German discoveries, but mainly plesiosaurs found in the sediments of the American Cretaceous ''[[Western Interior Seaway]]'', the [[Niobrara Chalk]]. One fossil in particular marked the start of the [[Bone Wars]] between the rival paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].
[[File:Cope Elasmosaurus.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Cope's ''Elasmosaurus'' with its head on the tail and lacking hindlimbs]]
In 1867, physician Theophilus Turner near [[Fort Wallace]] in [[Kansas]] uncovered a plesiosaur skeleton which he donated to Cope.<ref>Cope, E.D., 1868, [A resolution thanking Dr. Theophilus Turner for his donation of the skeleton of ''Elasmosaurus platyurus'']. ''Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phil.'' '''20''': 314</ref> Cope attempted to reconstruct the animal on the assumption the longer extremity of the vertebral column was the tail, the shorter one the neck. He soon noticed that the skeleton taking shape under his hands had some very special qualities: the neck vertebrae had chevrons and with the tail vertebrae the joint surfaces were orientated back to front.<ref>Cope, E.D., 1868, "Remarks on a new enaliosaurian, ''Elasmosaurus platyurus'', ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia'', '''20''': 92-93</ref> Excited, Cope concluded to have discovered an entirely new group of reptiles: the [[Streptosauria]] or "Turned Saurians" which would be distinguished by reversed vertebrae and a lack of hindlimbs, the tail providing the main propulsion.<ref>Cope, E.D., 1869, "On the reptilian orders Pythonomorpha and Streptosauria", ''Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History'' '''XII''': 250-266</ref> After having published a description of this animal,<ref>Cope, E.D., 1868, "On a new large enaliosaur", ''American Journal of Science series 2'', '''46'''(137): 263-264</ref> followed by an illustration in a text book about reptiles and amphibians,<ref>Cope, E.D., 1869. ''Synopsis of the Extinct Batrachia and Reptilia of North America, Part I''. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society New Series, 14, pp. 1-235</ref> Cope invited Marsh and [[Joseph Leidy]] to admire his new ''[[Elasmosaurus]] platyurus''. Having listened to Cope's interpretation for a while, Marsh suggested that a simpler explanation of the strange build would be that Cope had reversed the vertebral column relative to the body as a whole. When Cope reacted indignantly to this suggestion, Leidy silently took the skull and placed it against the presumed last tail vertebra to which it fitted perfectly: it was in fact the first neck vertebra, with still a piece of the rear skull attached to it.<ref>Leidy, J., 1870, "On the ''Elasmosaurus platyurus'' of Cope", ''American Journal of Science series 2'', '''49'''(147): 392</ref> Mortified, Cope tried to destroy the entire edition of the text book and when this failed, immediately published an improved edition with a correct illustration but an identical date of publication.<ref>Cope, E.D., 1870, ''Synopsis of the extinct Batrachia and Reptilia of North America''. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series 14, pp. 1-252</ref> He excused his mistake by claiming that he had been mislead by Leidy himself, who, describing a specimen of ''[[Cimoliasaurus]]'', had also reversed the vertebral column.<ref>Cope, E.D., 1870, "On ''Elasmosaurus platyurus'' Cope", ''American Journal of Science, series 2'', '''50'''(148): 140-141</ref> Marsh later claimed that the affair was the cause of his rivalry with Cope: "he has since been my bitter enemy". Both Cope en Marsh in their rivalry named many plesiosaur genera and species, most of which are today considered invalid.

Around the turn of the century, most plesiosaur research was done by a former student of Marsh, Professor [[Samuel Wendell Williston]]. In 1914, Williston published his ''Water reptiles of the past and present''.<ref>Williston, S.W., 1914, ''Water Reptiles of the Past and Present''. Chicago University Press. Chicago, Illinois. 251 pp</ref> Despite treating sea reptiles in general, it would for many years remain the most extensive general text on plesiosaurs. In 2013, a first modern text book was being prepared by [[Olivier Rieppel]]. During the middle of the twentieth century, the USA remained an important centre of research, mainly through the discoveries of [[Samuel Paul Welles]].

=== Recent discoveries ===
Whereas during the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, new plesiosaurs were described at a rate of three or four genera each decade, the pace suddenly picked up in the 1990s, with seventeen plesiosaurs being discovered in this period. The tempo of discovery accelerated in the early twenty-first century, about three or four plesiosaurs being named each year.<ref>Smith, A.S., 2003, ''Cladistic analysis of the Plesiosauria (Reptilia: Sauropterygia)''. Masters thesis in palaeobiology, University of Bristol, 91 pp</ref> This implies that about half of the known plesiosaurs are relatively new to science, a result of a far more intense field research. Some of this is taking place away from the traditional areas, e.g. in new sites developed in [[New Zealand]], [[Argentine]], [[Norway]], [[China]] and [[Morocco]], but the locations of the more original discoveries have proven to be still productive, important new finds having been made in England and Germany. Some of the new genera are a renaming of already known species, that were deemed sufficiently different to warrant a separate genus name. 
 
In 2002, the "Monster of Aramberri" was announced to the press. Discovered in 1982 at the village of [[Aramberri]], in the northern Mexican state of [[Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]], it was originally classified as a [[dinosaur]]. The specimen is actually a very large plesiosaur, possibly reaching {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} in length. The media published exaggerated reports claiming it was {{convert|25|m}} long, and weighed up to {{convert|150,000|kg}}, which would have made it the largest predator of all time. This error was dramatically perpetuated in [[BBC]]'s [[documentary film|documentary]] series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', which also prematurely classified it as a ''[[Liopleurodon]] ferox''.

In 2004, what appears to be a completely intact juvenile plesiosaur was discovered, by a local fisherman at [[Bridgwater Bay]] National Nature Reserve in Somerset, UK. The fossil, dated 180&nbsp;Ma by the [[ammonite]]s associated with it, measured {{convert|1.5|m}} in length, and may be related to ''[[Rhomaleosaurus]]''. It is probably the best preserved specimen of a plesiosaur yet discovered.<ref name=CollardPlesiosaur>{{cite journal|last=Larkin|first=Nigel|coauthors=O'Connor, Sonia; Parsons, Dennis|title=The virtual and physical preparation of the Collard plesiosaur from Bridgwater Bay, Somerset, UK|journal=Geological Curator|year=2010|volume=9|issue=3|pages=107}}</ref><ref name=CollardPlesiosaurSite>{{cite web|last=Forrest|first=Richard|title=The Collard Plesiosaur|url=http://www.plesiosaur.com/plesiosaurs/collard.php|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=LarkinCollardPreparation>{{cite web|last=Larkin|first=Nigel |title=Preparing and conserving an important six-foot long Plesiosaur skeleton for Somerset Museum|url=http://www.natural-history-conservation.com/plesiosaur.htm|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, a combined team of American and Argentinian investigators (the latter from the [[Instituto Ant<U+00E1>rtico Argentino|Argentinian Antarctic Institute]] and the [[La Plata Museum]]) found the skeleton of a juvenile plesiosaur measuring {{convert|1.5|m}} in length on [[Vega Island]] in Antarctica.<ref>Hallazgo de un ejemplar completo de plesiosaurio joven. http://www.dna.gov.ar/DIVULGAC/CPLESIO.HTM (In Spanish)</ref> The fossil is currently on display as the geological museum of [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]].

In 2008, fossil remains of an undescribed plesiosaur that was named [[Predator X]], now known as ''[[Pliosaurus funkei]]'', were unearthed in [[Svalbard]].<ref name=predX>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2218538/The-mystery-Predator-X--fearsome-prehistoric-monsters-er-wasnt-frightening-thought.html|title=The mystery of Predator X - the most fearsome of all prehistoric monsters (which turns out to be not quite as scary as we thought)|publisher=''[[Mail Online]]''|date=2012-10-17|accessdate=2012-10-17|location=USA|first=Gayle|last=Damien}}</ref> It had a length of {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}},<ref name=predX/> and its bite force of {{convert|149|kN}} is one of the most powerful known.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090321104455/http://www.nhm.uio.no/pliosaurus/english/ Naturhistorisk Museum, Universitetet i Oslo: PREDATOR X The most significant Jurassic discovery made in the Arctic]</ref>

Not only has the number of field discoveries increased, plesiosaurs have also since the 1950s been the subject of more extensive theoretical work. The new method of [[cladistics]] allowed for the first time to exactly calculate their evolutionary relationships. Several hypotheses have been published about the way they hunted and swam, incorporating general modern insights about [[biomechanics]] and [[ecology]]. The many recent discoveries have tested these hypotheses and given rise to new ones. The increasing scientific interest in the group has been called a "plesiosaur renaissance".

==Evolution==
[[File:Ceresiosaurus12.jpg|thumb|Nothosaurs still had functional legs]]
The Plesiosauria have their origins within the [[Sauropterygia]], a group of [[Lepidosauromorpha|lepidosauromorph]] reptiles that returned to the sea. An advanced sauropterygian subgroup, the carnivorous [[Eusauropterygia]] with small heads and long necks, during the [[Upper Triassic]] split into two branches. One of these, the [[Nothosauroidea]], kept functional elbow and knee joints, but the other, the [[Pistosauria]], more fully adapted to a sea-dwelling lifestyle. Their vertebral column became stiffer and the main propulsion while swimming no longer came from the tail but from the limbs, which changed into flippers.<ref>Rieppel O., 2000, ''Sauropterygia I. Handbuch der Pal<U+00E4>oherpetologie 12A''. M<U+00FC>nchen: Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil pp 134</ref> The Pistosauria became warm-blooded and [[viviparous]], giving birth to live young.<ref>Cheng Y-N., Wu X-C., Ji Q., 2004, "Chinese marine reptiles gave live birth to young", ''Nature'' '''423''': 383<U+2013>386</ref> Early, basal, members of the group, traditionally called "[[Pistosauridae|pistosaurids]]", still were largely coastal animals. Their shoulder girdles remained weak, their [[pelvis|pelves]] could not support the power of a strong swimming stroke, and their flippers were blunt. Later a more advanced pistosaurian group split off: the Plesiosauria. They had reinforced shoulder girdles, flatter pelves, and more pointed flippers. Other adaptations allowing them to colonise the open seas included stiff limb joints; an increase in the number of phalanges of the hand and foot; a tighter lateral connection of the finger and toe phalanx series, and a shortened tail.
[[File:Augustasaurus BW.jpg|left|thumb|Basal Pistosauria, like ''[[Augustasaurus]]'', already bore a strong resemblance to Plesiosauria]]
From the earliest [[Jurassic]], the [[Hettangian]] stage, a rich radiation of plesiosaurs is known, implying that the group must already have diversified in the [[Late Triassic]]; of this diversification only a few very basal forms have been discovered, however. The subsequent evolution of the plesiosaurs is very contentious. The various cladistic analyses have not resulted in a consensus about the relationships between the main plesiosaurian subgroups. Traditionally, plesiosaurs have been divided into the long-necked [[plesiosauroidea]] and the short-necked [[pliosauroidea]]. However, modern research suggests that some generally long-necked groups might have had short-necked members. To avoid a confusion between the [[phylogeny]], the evolutionary relationships, and the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], the way the animal is built, long-necked forms are therefore called "plesiosauromorph" and short-necked forms are called "pliosauromorph", without the "plesiosauromorph" species necessarily being more closely related to each other than to the "pliosauromorph" forms.<ref>O<U+2019>Keefe, F.R., 2002, "The evolution of plesioaur and pliosaur morphotypes in the Plesiosauria (Reptilia: Sauropterygia)", ''Paleobiology'', '''28''': 101<U+2013>112</ref>
[[File:Simolestes1DB.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the pliosaur ''[[Simolestes vorax]]'']]

The [[latest common ancestor]] of the Plesiosauria was probably a rather small short-necked form. During the earliest Jurassic, the subgroup with the most species was the [[Rhomaleosauridae]], a possibly very basal split-off of species which were also short-necked. Plesiosaurs in this period were at most five metres (sixteen feet) long. By the [[Toarcian]], about 180 million years ago, other groups, among them the [[Plesiosauridae]], became more numerous and some species developed longer necks, resulting in total body lengths of up to ten metres (33 feet).<ref name=Bensonetal12/>

In the middle of the Jurassic, very large [[Pliosauridae]] evolved, characterized by a large head and a short neck, such as ''[[Liopleurodon]]'' and ''[[Simolestes]]''. These forms had skulls up to three metres (ten feet) long and reached a length of up to seventeen metres (55 feet) and a weight of ten tonnes. The pliosaurids had large, conical teeth and were the dominant marine carnivores of their time. During the same time, approximately 160 million years ago, the [[Cryptoclididae]] were present, shorter species with a long neck and a small head.

During the [[Early Cretaceous]] at first the [[Leptocleididae]] radiated, rather small forms that despite their short necks might have been more closely related to the Plesiosauridae than to the Pliosauridae. Later in the Early Cretaceous, the [[Elasmosauridae]] appeared, that were among the longest plesiosaurs, reaching up to fifteen metres (fifty feet) in length due to very long necks containing as much as 76 vertebrae, more than any other known vertebrate. Pliosauridae were still present as is shown by large predators as ''[[Kronosaurus]]''.

At the beginning of the [[Late Cretaceous]] the [[Ichthyosauria]] became extinct; perhaps a plesiosaur group evolved to fill their niches: the [[Polycotylidae]] that had short necks and peculiarly elongated heads with narrow snouts. During the Late Cretaceous the elasmosaurids still had many species.

All plesiosaurs became [[extinction|extinct]] as a result of the [[K-T event]] at the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately {{period start|Paleogene}} million years ago.

===Phylogeny===
In modern [[phylogeny]], [[clade]]s are defined, groups that [[Monophyly|contain all species belonging to a certain branch of the evolutionary tree]]. One way to define a clade is to let it consist of the [[last common ancestor]] of two such species and all its descendants. Such a clade is called a "[[node-based taxon|node clade]]". In 2008, [[Patrick Druckenmiller]] and [[Anthony Russell]] in this way defined Plesiosauria as the group consisting of the last common ancestor of ''[[Plesiosaurus]] dolichocheirus'' and ''[[Peloneustes]] philarchus''; and all its descendants.<ref>Druckenmiller, P.S. & Russell, A.P., 2008, ''A phylogeny of Plesiosauria (Sauropterygia) and its bearing on the systematic status of'' Leptocleidus ''Andrews, 1922''. Zootaxa 1863. Aukland: Magnolia Press</ref> ''Plesiosaurus'' and ''Peloneustes'' represented the main subgroups of the Plesiosauroidea and the Pliosauroidea and were chosen for historical reasons; any other species from these groups would have sufficed.

Another way to define a clade is to let it consist of all species more closely related to a certain species that one in any case wishes to include in the clade, than to another species that one to the contrary desires to exclude. Such a clade is called a "[[stem-based taxon|stem clade]]". Such a definition has the advantage that it is easier to include all species with a certain [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. Plesiosauria was in 2010 by [[Hillary Ketchum]] and [[Roger Benson]] defined as such a [[stem-based taxon]]: "all taxa more closely related to ''[[Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus]]'' and ''[[Pliosaurus brachydeirus]]'' than to ''[[Augustasaurus hagdorni]]''". Ketchum and Benson (2010) also coined a new clade Neoplesiosauria, a [[node-based taxon]] that was defined by  as "''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'', ''Pliosaurus brachydeirus'', their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants".<ref name="Ketchum2010">{{cite journal |last1=Ketchum |first1=H.F. |last2=Benson |first2=R.B.J. |year=2010 |title=Global interrelationships of Plesiosauria (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) and the pivotal role of taxon sampling in determining the outcome of phylogenetic analyses |journal= Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=361<U+2013>392 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00107.x |pmid=20002391}}</ref> Neoplesiosauria very likely is materially identical to Plesiosauria ''sensu'' Druckenmiller & Russell and was meant to be a replacement of this concept.

Benson ''et al.'' (2012) found the traditional Pliosauroidea to be [[paraphyletic]] in relation to Plesiosauroidea. Rhomaleosauridae was found to be outside Neoplesiosauria, but still within Plesiosauria. The early [[carnian]] pistosaur ''[[Bobosaurus]]'' was found to be more advanced than ''[[Augustasaurus]]'' in relation to the Plesiosauria and therefore it represents by definition the oldest known plesiosaur. However, the authors excluded ''Bobosaurus'' from this clade without any explanation, although that exclusion might be a typo in the article. This analysis focused on basal plesiosaurs and therefore only one derived pliosaurid and one [[cryptoclidia]]n were included, while [[Elasmosauridae|elasmosaurid]]s weren't included at all. The cladogram below follows the topology from Benson et al. (2012) analysis.<ref name=Bensonetal12/>

[[File:Fossil-Plesiosaurier-Skelett.jpg|thumb|Plesiosaur skeleton of ''[[Meyerasaurus]]'' in the [[Museum am L<U+00F6>wentor]], [[Stuttgart]], seen from below]]
In general, plesiosaurians varied in adult length from between 1.5 metres (five feet) to about fifteen metres (fifty feet). The group thus contained some of the largest marine [[apex predator]]s in the [[fossil record]], roughly equalling the longest [[ichthyosaurs]], [[mosasaurids]], [[sharks]] and [[toothed whales]] in size. Some plesiosaurian remains, such as a 2.9 metres long set of highly reconstructed and fragmentary lower jaws preserved in the ''[[Oxford University Museum]]'' and referable to ''[[Pliosaurus rossicus]]'' (previously referred to ''[[Stretosaurus]]''<ref>Tarlo, L.B.H., 1959, "''Stretosaurus'' gen nov., a giant pliosaur from the Kimmeridge Clay", ''Palaeontology'' '''2'''(2): 39-55</ref> and ''[[Liopleurodon]]''), indicated a length of seventeen metres. However, it was recently argued that its size cannot be currently determined due to their being poorly reconstructed. MCZ 1285, a specimen currently referable to ''[[Kronosaurus queenslandicus]]'', from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[Australia]], was estimated to have a skull length of {{convert|2.85|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Pliosaurus2013>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0065989}}</ref>

===Skeleton===
The typical plesiosaur had a broad, flat, body and a short [[tail]]. Plesiosaurs retained their ancestral two pairs of limbs, which had evolved into large [[Flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s.<ref>Caldwell, Michael W; 1997b. Modified perichondral ossification and the evolution of paddle-like limbs in Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs; Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology; 17 (3); 534-547</ref> Plesiosaurs were related to the earlier [[Nothosauridae]],<ref>Storrs, Glenn W.; 1990. Phylogenetic Relationships of Pachypleurosaurian and Nothosauriform Reptiles (Diapsida: Sauropterygia); Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology; 10 (Supplement to Number 3)</ref> that had a more crocodile-like body. The flipper arrangement is unusual in aquatic animals in that probably all four limbs were used to propel the animal through the water by up-and-down movements. The tail was most likely only used for helping in directional control. This situation is in contrast to that of the [[ichthyosaurs]] and the later [[mosasaur]]s, in which the tail provided the main propulsion. 

To power the flippers, the [[shoulder girdle]] and the [[pelvis]] had been greatly modified, developing into broad bone plates at the underside of the body, that served as an attachment surface for large muscle groups, able to pull the limbs downwards. In the shoulder the [[coracoid]] had become the largest element covering the major part of the breast. The [[scapula]] was much smaller, forming the outer front edge of the trunk. To the middle it continued into a [[clavicle]] and finally a small [[interclavicular bone]]. As with most [[tetrapods]], the shoulder joint was formed by the scapula and coracoid. In the pelvis, the bone plate was formed by the [[ischium]] at the rear and the larger [[pubic bone]] in front of it. The [[ilium]], that with land vertebrates bears the weight of the hindlimb, had become a small element at the rear, no longer attached to either the pubic bone or the thighbone. The hip joint was formed by the ischium and pubic bone. The pectoral and pelvic plates were connected by a [[plastron]], a bone cage formed by the paired [[belly rib]]s that each had a middle and an outer section. This arrangement immobilised the entire trunk.

To become flippers, the limbs had changed considerably. The limbs were very large, each about as long as the trunk. The forelimbs and hindlimbs strongly resembled each other. The [[humerus]] in the upper arm, and the thighbone in the upper leg, had become large flat bones, expanded at their outer ends. The elbow joints and the knee joints were no longer functional: the lower arm and the lower leg could not flex in relation to the upper limb elements but formed a flat continuation of them. All outer bones had become flat supporting elements of the flippers, tightly connected to each other and hardly able to rotate, flex, extend or spread. This was true of the [[ulna]], [[radius]], [[metacarpals]] and fingers, as well of the [[tibia]], [[fibula]], [[metatarsals]] and toes. Furthermore, in order to elongate the flippers, the number of phalanges had increased, up to eighteen in a row, a phenomenon called [[hyperphalangy]]. The flippers were not perfectly flat but had a lightly convexly curved top profile, like an [[airfoil]], to be able to "fly" through the water.
[[File:Elasmosaur.jpg|thumb|Elasmosaur cast, [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]]]
While plesiosaurs varied little in the build of the trunk, and can be called "conservative" in this respect, there were major differences between the subgroups as regarded the form of the neck and the skull. Plesiosaurs can be divided into two major morphological types that differ in head and [[neck]] size. "Plesiosauromorphs", such as [[Cryptoclididae]], [[Elasmosauridae]], and [[Plesiosauridae]], had long necks and small heads. "Pliosauromorphs" such as the [[Pliosauridae]] and the [[Rhomaleosauridae]] had shorter necks with a large, elongated head. The neck length variations were not caused by an elongation of the individual neck vertebrae but by increasing the number of these cervical vertebrae. ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' has seventy-two neck vertebrae; the known record is held by the elasmosaurid ''[[Albertonectes]]'', with seventy-six cervicals.<ref>Tai Kubo, Mark T. Mitchell & Donald M. Henderson, 2012, "''Albertonectes vanderveldei'', a new elasmosaur (Reptilia, Sauropterygia) from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''32'''(3): 557-572</ref> The large number of joints implied, suggested to early researchers that the neck must have been very flexible. Especially a swan-like curvature of the neck was assumed to be possible; in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] plesiosaurs are even called ''Svane<U+00F0>lur'', "swan lizards". However, modern research has confirmed an earlier conjecture of Williston that the long plate-like spines on top of the vertebrae, the ''processus spinosi'', strongly limited a vertical movement. Although horizontal curving was less restricted, in general the neck must have been rather stiff and certainly was incapable of being bent into serpentine coils. This is even more true of the short-necked "pliosauromophs" that had as few as eleven cervicals. With early forms the [[amphicoelous]] or amphiplat neck vertebrae bore double-headed neck ribs; later forms had single-headed ribs. In the remainder of the [[vertebral column]], the number of [[dorsal vertebrae]] varied between about nineteen and thirty-two, of the sacral vertebrae between two and six, and of the tail vertebrae between about twenty-one and thirty-two. These vertebrae still possessed the original processes inherited from the land-dwelling ancestors of the Sauropterygia and had not been reduced to fish-like simple discs, as happened with the vertebrae of ichthyosaurs. The tail vertebrae possessed chevron bones. The dorsal vertebrae of plesiosaurs are easily recognisable by two large ''foramina subcentralia'', paired vascular openings at the underside.

The skull of plesiosaurs showed the "[[Euryapsida|euryapsid]]" condition, lacking the lower [[temporal fenestra|temporal fenestrae]], the openings at the lower rear sides. The upper temporal fenestrae formed large openings at the sides of the rear skull roof, the attachment for muscles closing the lower jaws. The eye sockets were large, in general pointing obliquely upwards; the pliosaurids had more sideways directed eyes. The eyes were supported by [[scleral ring]]s, the form of which shows that they were relatively flat, an adaptation to diving.  The anteriorly placed internal nostrils, the ''[[choana|choanae]]'', have palatal grooves to channel water, the flow of which would be maintained by hydrodynamic pressure over the posteriorly placed, in front of the eye sockets, external nares during swimming. According to one hypothesis, during its passage through the nasal ducts, the water would have been 'smelled' by olfactory epithelia.<ref>Cruickshank, A.R.I., Small, P.G. & Taylor, M.A., 1991, "Dorsal nostrils and hydrodynamically driven underwater olfaction in plesiosaurs", ''Nature'' '''352''': 62-64</ref><ref>Brown, D. S. and Cruickshank, A. R. I. 1994. The skull of the Callovian plesiosaur ''Cryptoclidus eurymerus'' and the sauropterygian cheek. Palaeontology, 37, (4), 941-953</ref> However, more to the rear a second pair of openings is present in the palate; a later hypothesis holds that these are the real ''choanae'' and the front pair in reality represented paired [[salt gland]]s.<ref>Buchy, M C., Frey, E. and Salisbury, S.W., 2006, "The internal cranial anatomy of the Plesiosauria (Reptilia, Sauropterygia): evidence for a functional secondary palate", ''Lethaia'', '''39'''(4): 289-303</ref> The distance between the eye sockets and the nostrils was so limited because the [[nasal bone]]s were strongly reduced, with many species even absent. The [[premaxilla]]e directed touched the [[frontal bone]]s, with the elasmosaurids even reaching backwards to the [[parietal bone]]s. Often also the [[lacrimal bone]]s were lacking.
[[File:SeeleysaurusDB.jpg|thumb|''[[Seeleyosaurus]]'' with a tail fin]]
The tooth form and number was very variable. Some forms had hundreds of needle-like teeth. Most species had larger conical teeth with a round or oval cross-section. Such teeth numbered four to six in the praemaxilla and about fourteen to twenty-five in the [[maxilla]]; the number in the lower jaws roughly equalled that of the skull. The teeth were placed in tooth-sockets, had vertically wrinkled enamel and lacked a true cutting edge or ''[[carina]]''. With some species the front teeth were notably longer, to grab prey.

===Soft tissues===
Soft tissue remains of plesiosaurs are rare, but sometimes, especially in [[shale]] deposits, they have been partly preserved, e.g. showing the outlines of the body. An early discovery in this respect was the holotype of ''Plesiosaurus conybeari'' (presently ''[[Attenborosaurus]]''). From such finds it is known that the skin was smooth, without apparent scales but with small wrinkles, that the trailing edge of the flippers extended considerably behind the limb bones;<ref>Huene, F. von, 1923, "Ein neuer Plesiosaurier aus dem oberen Lias W<U+00FC>rttembergs", ''Jahreshefte des Vereins f<U+00FC>r vaterl<U+00E4>ndische Naturkunde in W<U+00FC>rttemberg'' '''79''': 1-21</ref> and that the tail bore a vertical fin, as reported by [[Wilhelm Dames]] in his description of ''Plesiosaurus  guilelmiimperatoris'' (presently ''[[Seeleyosaurus]]'').<ref>Dames, W., 1895, "Die Plesiosaurier der S<U+00FC>ddeutschen Liasformation", ''Abhandlungen der K<U+00F6>niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin'' '''1895''': 1<U+2013>81</ref> The possibility of a tail fluke has been confirmed by recent studies on the caudal neural spine form of ''[[Pantosaurus]]'', ''[[Cryptoclidus]]'' and ''Rhomaleosaurus zetlandicus''.<ref>Wilhelm, B.C., 2010, ''Novel anatomy of cryptoclidid plesiosaurs with comments on axial locomotion''.

===Food===
The probable food source of plesiosaurs varied depending on whether they belonged to the long-necked "plesiosauromorph" forms or the short-necked "pliosauromorph" species.

The extremely long necks of "plesiosauromorphs" have caused speculation as to their function from the very moment their special build became apparent. Already Conybeare offered three possible explanations. The neck could have served to intercept fast-moving fish in a pursuit. Alternatively, plesiosaurs rested on the sea bottom while the head was sent out to search for prey. This seemed to be confirmed by the fact the eyes were directed relatively upwards. Finally, Conybeare suggested the possibility that plesiosaurs swam on the surface, letting their necks plunge downwards to seek food at lower levels. All these interpretations took for granted that the neck was very flexible. The modern insight that the neck was in fact rather rigid, with limited vertical movement, has necessitated new explanations. One hypothesis is that the length of the neck made it possible to surprise schools of fish, the head arriving before the sight or pressure wave of the trunk could alert them. "Plesiosauromorphs" hunted visually, as shown by their large eyes, and perhaps employed a directional sense of olfaction. Hard and soft-bodied cephalopods probably formed part of their diet. Their [[jaw]]s were probably strong enough to bite through the hard shells of this prey type. Fossil specimens have been found with cephalopod shells still in their stomach.<ref>C.R. McHenry, A.G Cook, and S. Wroe, 2005, "Bottom-feeding plesiosaurs", ''Science'' '''310''': 75</ref> The [[bony fish]] ([[Osteichthyes]]), which further diversified during the Jurassic, were likely prey as well. A very different hypothesis claims that "plesiosauromorphs" were bottom feeders. The stiff necks would have been used to plough the sea bottom, eating the [[benthos]]. This would have been proven by long furrows present in ancients seabeds.<ref>{{citation|title=Plesiosaur bottom-feeding shown |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4341204.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=21 may 2012}}</ref><ref>Geister, J., 1998, "Lebensspuren von Meersauriern und ihren Beutetieren im mittleren Jura (Callovien) von Liesberg, Schweiz", ''Facies'', '''39'''(1): 105-124</ref> "Plesiosauromorphs" were not well adapted to catching large fast-moving prey, as their long necks, though seemingly streamlined, caused enormous [[skin friction]]. [[Sankar Chatterjee]] in 1989 suggested that some [[Cryptocleididae]] were suspension feeders, filtering [[plankton]]. ''[[Aristonectes]]'' e.g. had hundreds of teeth, allowing it to sieve small [[Crustacea]] from the water.<ref>Chatterjee, S. and Small, B.J., 1989, "New plesiosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous of Antarctica", In: Crame, J.(ed) ''Origins and Evolution of Antarctic Biota'', pp. 197-215, Geological Society Publishing House, London</ref>

The short-necked "pliosauromorphs" were top carnivores, or [[apex predator]]s, in their respective foodwebs.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Plesiosaur Directory|url=http://www.plesiosauria.com/diet.php |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> They were pursuit predators<ref>Massare, J.A., 1992, "Ancient mariners", ''Natural History'' '''101''': 48<U+2013>53</ref> or ambush predators of various sized prey and opportunistic feeders; their teeth could be used to pierce soft-bodied prey, especially fish.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J A Massare |year=1987 |title=Tooth morphology and prey preference of Mesozoic marine reptiles |journal=J.

Their morphology allowed for a high swimming speed. They too hunted visually.

Plesiosaurs were themselves prey for other carnivores as shown by bite marks left by a shark that have been discovered on a fossilized plesiosaur fin<ref>Everhart, M. J. 2005.

Skeletons have also been discovered with [[gastrolith]]s, stones, in their stomachs, though whether to help break down food, especially cephalopods, in a muscular gizzard, or to vary [[buoyancy]], or both, has not been established.<ref>Williston, Samuel Wendel; 1904.

Gastroliths associated with plesiosaur remains in the Sharon Springs Member of the Pierre Shale (Late Cretaceous), western Kansas. Kansas Acad. Sci. Trans. 103(1-2):58-69</ref> However, the total weight of the gastroliths found in various specimens appear to be insufficient to modify the buoyancy of these large reptiles.<ref>Cerda, A y Salgado, L. 2008.

In 1949 a fossil of ''[[Alzadasaurus]]'' (specimen SDSM 451, later renamed to ''[[Styxosaurus]]'') showed 253 of them.<ref>Welles, S.P. and J.D. Bump, 1949, "''Alzadasaurus pembertoni'', a new elasmosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of South Dakota", ''Journal of Paleontolgy'' '''23'''(5): 521-535</ref> Also, the size of individual stones is often considerable. In 1991 an elasmosaurid specimen was investigated, KUVP 129744, containing a gastrolith with a diameter of seventeen centimetres and a weight of 1.3 kilogramme; and a somewhat shorter stone of 1490 gram. In total forty-seven gastroliths were present with a combined weight of thirteen kilogramme. The size of the stones has been seen as an indication that they were not swallowed by accident but deliberately, the animal perhaps covering large distances in search of a suitable rock type.<ref>Everhart, M.J., 2000, "Gastroliths associated with plesiosaur remains in the Sharon Springs Member of the Pierre Shale (late Cretaceous), Western Kansas", ''Kansas Academy of Sciences Transactions'' '''103'''(1-2): 58-69</ref>

===Locomotion===
====Flipper movement====
The distinctive four-flippered design has caused considerable speculation about what kind of stroke plesiosaurs used. The only modern group with four flippers are sea turtles which only use the front pair for propulsion. Conybeare and Buckland already compared the flippers with bird wings also. However, such a comparison was not very informative as the mechanics of bird flight in this period were poorly understood. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was typically assumed that plesiosaurs employed a rowing movement. The flippers would have been moved forward in a horizontal position, to minimise friction, and then axially rotated to a vertical position in order to be pulled to the rear, causing the largest possible [[Reaction (physics)|reactive force]]. In fact such a method would be very inefficient: the recovery stroke in this case generates no thrust and the rear stroke generates an enormous turbulence. In the early twentieth century, the newly discovered principles of bird flight suggested to several researchers that plesiosaurs like turtles and penguins made a flying movement while swimming. This was e.g. proposed by [[Eberhard Fraas]] in 1905,<ref>Fraas, E., 1905, "Reptilien und S<U+00E4>ugetiere in ihren Anpassungserscheinungen an das marine Leben", ''Jahresheften des Vereins f<U+00FC>r vaterl<U+00E4>ndische Naturkunde in W<U+00FC>rttemberg'' '''29''': 347-386</ref> and in 1908 by [[Othenio Abel|Othenio Lothar Franz Anton Louis Abel]].<ref>Abel, O., 1908, "Die Anpassungsformen der Wirbeltiere an das Meeresleben", ''Schriften des Vereines zur Verbreitung naturwissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse in Wien'', '''48'''(14): 395 <U+2013> 422</ref> When flying, the flipper movement is more vertical, its point describing an oval or "8". Ideally, the flipper is first moved obliquely to the front and downwards and then, after a slight retraction and rotation, crosses this path from below to be pulled to the front and upwards. During both strokes, down and up, according to [[Bernoulli's principle]], forward and upward thrust is generated by the convexly curved upper profile of the flipper, the front edge slightly inclined relative to the water flow, while turbulence is minimal. However, despite the evident advantages of such a swimming method, in 1924 the first systematic study on the musculature of plesiosaurs, by [[David Meredith Seares Watson]], concluded they nevertheless performed a rowing movement.<ref>Watson, D.M.S., 1924, "The elasmosaurid shoulder-girdle and fore-limb", ''Proceedings of the Zo<U+00F6>logical Society of London'', '''1924'''(2): 885-917</ref>

During the middle of the twentieth century, Watson's "rowing model" remained the dominant hypothesis regarding the plesiosaur swimming stroke. In 1957, [[Beverly Halstead|Lambert Beverly Halstead]], at the time using the family name Tarlo, proposed a variant: the hindlimbs would have rowed in the horizontal plane but the forelimbs would have paddled, moved to below and to the rear.<ref>Tarlo, L.B., 1957, "The scapula of ''Pliosaurus macromerus'' Phillips", ''Palaeontology'' '''1''': 193<U+2013>199</ref><ref>Halstead, L.B., 1989, "Plesiosaur locomotion", ''Journal of the Geological Society'' '''146''': 37-40</ref> In 1975, the traditional model was challenged by [[Jane Ann Robinson]] who revived the "flying" hypothesis. She argued that the main muscle groups were optimally placed for a vertical flipper movement, not for pulling the limbs horizontally, and that the form of the shoulder and hip joints would have precluded the vertical rotation needed for rowing.<ref>Robinson, J.A., 1975, "The locomotion of plesiosaurs", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Abhandlungen'' '''149'''(3): 286-332</ref> In a subsequent article, Robinson proposed that the [[kinetic energy]] generated by the forces exerted on the trunk by the strokes, would have been stored and released as [[elastic energy]] in the ribcage, allowing for an especially efficient and dynamic propulsion system.<ref>Robinson, J.A., 1977, "Intercorporal force transmission in plesiosaurs", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Abhandlungen'', '''153'''(1): 88-128</ref>

In Robinson's model, both the downstroke and the upstroke would have been powerful. In 1982 she was criticised by [[Samuel Tarsitano]], [[Eberhard Frey]] and [[J<U+00FC>rgen Riess]], who claimed that, while the muscles at the underside of the shoulder and pelvic plates were clearly powerful enough to pull the limbs downwards, comparable muscle groups on the top of these plates to elevate the limbs were simply lacking, and, had they been present, could not have been forcefully employed, their bulging carrying the danger of hurting the internal organs. They proposed a more limited flying model in which a powerful downstroke was combined with a largely unpowered recovery, the flipper returning to its original position by the momentum of the forward moving and temporarily sinking body.<ref>Tarsitano, S. & Riess, J., 1982, "Plesiosaur locomotion <U+2014> underwater flight versus rowing", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Abhandlungen'' '''164''': 193-194</ref><ref>Frey, E. & Reiss, J., 1982, "Considerations concerning plesiosaur locomotion", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Abhandlungen'' '''164''': 188-192</ref> This modified flying model became a popular interpretation. Less attention was given to an alternative hypothesis by [[Stephen Godfrey (biologist)|Stephen Godfrey]], in 1984 proposing that both the forelimbs and hindlimbs performed a deep paddling motion to the rear combined with a powered recovery stroke to the front, resembling the movement made by the forelimbs of sea-lions.<ref>Stephen J. Godfrey, 1984, "Plesiosaur subaqueous locomotion: a reappraisal", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie'' '''1984'''(11): 661-672</ref>

In 2010, [[Frank Sanders (biologist)|Frank Sanders]] and [[Kenneth Carpenter]] published a study concluding that Robinsons's model had been correct. Frey & Riess would have been mistaken in their assertion that the shoulder and pelvic plates had no muscles attached to their upper sides. While these muscle groups were probably not very powerful, this could easily have been compensated by the large muscles on the back, especially the ''[[Musculus latissimus dorsi]]'' which would have been well developed in view of the high spines on the backbone. Furthermore, the flat build of the shoulder and hip joints strongly indicated that the main movement was vertical, not horizontal.<ref name="Sanders2010">F. Sanders, K. Carpenter, B. Reed, and J. Reed, 2010, "Plesiosaur swimming reconstructed from skeletal analysis and experimental results", ''Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science'' '''113'''(1/2): 1-34</ref>

====Gait====
[[File:Plesiosaurus2.jpg|thumb|Frey & Riess favoured an "alternating" gait]]
Like all [[tetrapods]] with limbs, plesiosaurs must have had a certain [[gait]], a coordinated movement pattern of the, in this case, flippers. Of the infinite number of possibilities, attention in practice has been largely directed to the question of whether the front pair and hind pair moved simultaneously, so that all four flippers were engaged at the same moment, or in an alternate pattern, each pair being employed in turn. Frey & Riess in 1991 proposed an alternate model, which would have had the advantage of a more continuous propulsion.<ref>Riess, J. and E. Frey, 1991. "The evolution of underwater flight and the locomotion of plesiosaurs", In: J.M.V. Rayner and R.J. Wootton (eds.) ''Biomechanics in Evolution'', Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, pp. 131-144</ref> In 2000, [[Theagarten Lingham-Soliar]] evaded the question by concluding that, like sea turtles, plesiosaurs only used the front pair for a powered stroke. The hind pair would have been merely used for steering. Lingham-Soliar deduced this from the form of the hip joint, which would have allowed for only a limited vertical movement. Furthermore a separation of the propulsion and steering function would have facilitated the general coordination of the body and prevented a too extreme [[Pitch (aviation)|pitch]]. He rejected Robinson's hypothesis that elastic energy was stored in the ribcage, considering the ribs too stiff for this.<ref>T. Lingham-Soliar, 2000, "Plesiosaur locomotion: Is the four-wing problem real or merely an atheoretical exercise?", ''Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Abhandlungen'' '''217''': 45-87</ref> 

The interpretation by Frey & Riess became the dominant one but was in 2004 challenged by Sanders, who showed experimentally that, whereas an alternate movement might have caused excessive pitching, a simultaneous movement would have caused only a slight pitch, which could have been easily controlled by the hind flippers. Of the other axial movements, [[rolling]] could have been controlled by alternately engaging the flippers of the right or left side, and [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] by the long neck or a vertical tail fin. Sanders did not believe that the hind pair was not used for propulsion, concluding that the limitations imposed by the hip joint were very relative.<ref>Sanders, F., Carpenter, K., Reed, B. and Reed, J., 2004, "Plesiosaur swimming reconstructed from skeletal analysis and experimental results", ''Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology'', '''24''': 108A-109A</ref> In 2010, Sanders & Carpenter concluded that with an alternating gait, the turbulence caused by the front pair would have hindered an effective action of the hind pair. Besides, a long gliding phase after a simultaneous engagement would have been very energy efficient.<ref name="Sanders2010"/> It is also possible that the gait was optional and was adapted to the circumstances. During a fast steady pursuit an alternate movement would have been useful, in an ambush a simultaneous stroke would have made a peak speed possible. When searching for prey over a longer distance a combination of a simultaneous movement with gliding would have cost the least energy.<ref>Long, J. H., Schumaker, J., Livingston, N. and Kemp, M., 2006, "Four flippers or two? Tetrapodal swimming with an aquatic robot", ''Bioinspiration and Biomimetics'', '''1''': 20-29</ref>

====Speed====
[[File:Kronosaurus2 NT.jpg|thumb|A short-necked [[Pliosauridae|pliosaurid]] like ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' would have been capable of overtaking a long-necked plesiosaur that, however, would be more manoeuvrable]]
In general, it is hard to determine the maximum speed of extinct sea creatures. For plesiosaurs this is made more difficult by the lack of consensus about their flipper stroke and gait. There are no exact calculations of their [[Reynolds Number]]. Fossil impressions show that the skin was relatively smooth, not scaled, and this may have reduced [[form drag]].<ref name="Sanders2010"/> Small wrinkles are present in the skin that may have prevented separation of the [[laminar flow]] in the [[boundary layer]] and thereby reduced [[skin friction]].

[[Cruise (flight)|Sustained speed]] may be estimated by calculating the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a simplified model of the body, that can be approached by a [[prolate spheroid]], and the sustainable level of energy output by the [[muscles]]. A first study of this problem was published by [[Judy Massare]] in 1988.<ref>Massare, J.A., 1988, "Swimming capabilities of Mesozoic marine reptiles: implications for methods of predation", ''Paleobiology'' '''14''': 187-205</ref> Even when assuming a low [[hydrodynamic efficiency]] of 0.65, Massare's model seemed to indicate that plesiosaurs, if warm-blooded, would have cruised at a speed of four metres per second, or about fourteen kilometres per hour, considerably exceeding the known speeds of extant dolphins and whales.<ref name="Massare1994">Massare, J.A., 1994, "Swimming capabilities of Mesozoic marine reptiles: a review", In: L. Maddock et al. (eds.) ''Mechanics and Physiology of Animal Swimming'', Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press pp 133-149</ref> However, [[Ryosuke Motani]] in 2002 showed that the formulae Massare used, had been flawed. A recalculation, using corrected formulae, resulted in a speed of half a metre per second (1,8 km/h) for a cold-blooded plesiosaur and one and a half metre per second (5,4 km/h) for an [[endothermic]] plesiosaur. Even the highest estimate is about a third lower than the speed of extant [[Cetacea]].<ref>Motani, R., 2002, "Swimming speed estimation of extinct marine reptiles: energetic approach revisited", ''Paleobiology'' '''28''': 251-262</ref>

Massare also tried to compare the speeds of plesiosaurs with those of the two other main sea reptile groups, the [[Ichthyosauria]] and the [[Mosasauridae]]. She concluded that plesiosaurs were about 20% slower than advanced ichthyosaurs, which employed a very effective tunniform movement, oscillating just the tail, but 5% faster than mosasaurids which were assumed to swim with an inefficient anguilliform, eel-like, movement of the body.<ref name="Massare1994"/>  

The many plesiosaur species may have differed considerably in their swimming speeds, reflecting the various body shapes present in the group. While the short-necked "pliosauromorphs" (e.g. ''[[Liopleurodon]]'') may have been fast swimmers, the long-necked "plesiosauromorphs" were built more for manoeuvrability than for speed, slowed by a strong skin friction, yet capable of a fast rolling movement. Some long-necked forms, such as the [[Elasmosauridae]], also have relatively short stubby flippers with a low [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], further reducing speed but improving roll.<ref>O'Keefe, F.R., 2001, "Ecomorphology of plesiosaur flipper geometry", ''Journal of Evolutionary Biology'' '''14''': 987-991</ref>

====Diving====
Few data are available that show how deep exactly plesiosaurs dived. That they dived to some considerable depth is proven by traces of [[decompression sickness]]. The heads of the ''[[Humerus|humeri]]'' and ''[[femur|femora]]'' with many fossils show [[necrosis]] of the bone tissue, caused by a too rapid ascent after deep diving. However, this does not allow to deduce some exact depth as the damage could have been caused by a few very deep dives, or alternatively by a great number of relatively shallow descents. The vertebrae show no such damage: they were probably protected by a superior blood supply, made possible by the arteries entering the bone through the two ''foramina subcentralia'', large openings in their undersides.<ref>Rothschild, B.M. & Storrs, G.W., 2003, "Decompression syndrome in plesiosaurs (Sauropterygia: Reptilia)", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''23''': 324-328</ref>

Descending would have been helped by a negative [[Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Force]], i.e. being heavier than water. Of course, this would have had the disadvantage of hampering coming up up again. Young plesiosaurs show [[pachyostosis]], an extreme density of the bone tissue, which might have increased relative weight. Adult individuals have more spongy bone. [[Gastroliths]] have been suggested as a method to increase weight<ref>Taylor, M.A., 1981, "Plesiosaurs <U+2014> rigging and ballasting", ''Nature'', '''290''': 628-629</ref> or even as means to attain neutral [[buoyancy]], swallowing or spitting them out again as needed.<ref>Taylor, M.A., 1993, "Stomach stones for feeding or buoyancy? The occurrence and function of gastroliths in marine tetrapods", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'' '''341''': 163<U+2013>175</ref> They might also have been used to increase stability.<ref>Henderson, D.M., 2006, "Floating point: a computational study of buoyancy, equilibrium, and gastroliths in plesiosaurs", ''Lethaia'' '''39''': 227<U+2013>244</ref>

The relatively large eyes of the [[Cryptocleididae]] have been seen as an adaptation to deep diving.

===Metabolism===
Traditionally, of extinct reptile groups it was assumed that they were cold-blooded like modern reptiles. New research during the past decades has lead to the conclusion that some groups, such as [[theropod]] [[dinosaurs]] and [[pterosaurs]], were very likely warm-blooded. Whether perhaps plesiosaurs too were warm-blooded, is difficult to determine. One of the indications of a high [[metabolism]] is the presence of fast-growing [[fibrolamellar bone]]. The pachyostosis with juvenile individuals makes it hard to establish whether plesiosaurs possessed such bone, though. However, it has been possible to check its occurrence with more basal members of the more inclusive group plesiosaurs belonged to, the [[Sauropterygia]]. A study in 2010 concluded fibrolamellar bone was originally present with sauropterygians.<ref>Klein N., 2010, "Long Bone Histology of Sauropterygia from the Lower Muschelkalk of the Germanic Basin Provides Unexpected Implications for Phylogeny", ''PLoS ONE'' '''5'''(7): e11613. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0011613</ref> A subsequent publication in 2013 found that the [[Nothosauridae]] lacked this bone type but that basal [[Pistosauria]] possessed it, a sign of a more elevated metabolism.<ref>Anna Krahl, Nicole Klein & P Martin Sander, 2013, "Evolutionary implications of the divergent long bone histologies of ''Nothosaurus'' and ''Pistosaurus'' (Sauropterygia, Triassic)", ''BMC Evolutionary Biology'', '''13''': 123</ref> It is thus more [[parsimonious]] to assume that the more derived pistosaurians, the plesiosaurs, also had a faster metabolism.

===Reproduction===
[[File:Polycotylus NT.jpg|thumb|A ''Polycotylus'' female giving birth to her single young]]
As reptiles in general are [[oviparous]], until the end of the twentieth century it had been seen as possible that smaller plesiosaurs may have crawled up on a beach to lay eggs, like modern [[turtles]]. Their strong limbs and a flat underside seemed to have made this feasible. This method was e.g. defended by Halstead. However, as those limbs no longer had functional elbow or knee joints and the underside by its very flatness would have generated a large friction, already in the nineteenth century it was hypothesised that plesiosaurs had been [[viviparous]]. Besides, it was hard to conceive how the largest species, as big as whales, could have survived a beaching. Fossils finds of embryos of ichthyosaurs showed that at least one group of marine reptiles had bore live young. The first to claim that similar embryos had been found with plesiosaurs was [[Harry Govier Seeley]] who reported in 1887 to have acquired a nodule with four to eight tiny skeletons.<ref>Seeley, H.G., 1888, "On the Mode of Development of the Young in ''Plesiosaurus''", ''Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; held at Manchester September, 1887'' pp.697-698</ref> In 1896, he described this discovery in more detail.<ref>Seeley, H. G.; 1896; "On a pyritous concretion from the Lias of Whitby which appears to show the external form of the body of embryos of a species of ''Plesiosaurus''", ''Annual Report of Yorkshire philosophical Society'' pp.20-29</ref> If authentic, the embryos of plesiosaurs would have been very small like those of ichthyosaurs. However, in 1982 [[Richard Anthony Thulborn]] showed that Seeley had been deceived by a "doctored" fossil of a nest of crayfish.<ref>Thulborn, R.A., 1982, "Liassic plesiosaur embryos reinterpreted as shrimp burrows", ''Palaeontology'' '''25''': 351-359</ref> 

A real plesiosaur specimen found in 1987 eventually proved that plesiosaurs gave birth to live young:<ref name="O'Keefe2011">O'Keefe, F.R. and Chiappe, L.M. (2011): ''Viviparity and K-Selected Life History in a Mesozoic Marine Plesiosaur (Reptilia, Sauropterygia).'' [[Science]], 333 (6044): 870-873 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1205689}}</ref> This fossil of a pregnant ''[[Polycotylus]] latippinus'' shows that these animals gave birth to a single large juvenile and probably invested parental care in their offspring, similar to modern whales. The young was 1.5 metres (five feet) long and thus large compared to its mother of five metres (sixteen feet) length, indicating a [[k-strategy]] in reproduction.<ref>{{citation|first=Jennifer|last=Welsh|title=Pregnant Fossil Suggests Ancient 'Sea Monsters' Birthed Live Young|url=http://www.livescience.com/15517-pregnant-plesiosaur-big-live-young.html|publisher=LiveScience|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Little is known about growth rates or a possible [[sexual dimorphism]].

===Social behaviour and intelligence===
From the parental care indicated by the large size of the young it can be deduced that social behaviour in general was relatively complex.<ref name="O'Keefe2011"/> It is not known whether plesiosaurs hunted in packs. Their relative brain size seems to be typical for reptiles. Of the senses, sight and smell were important, hearing less so; elasmosaurids have lost the [[stapes]] completely. It has been suggested that with some groups the skull housed electro-sensitive organs.<ref>O<U+2019>Gorman, J.P. & Gasparini, Z., 2013, "Revision of ''Sulcusuchus erraini'' (Sauropterygia, Polycotylidae) from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina", ''Alcheringa'' '''37''': 161<U+2013>174</ref>

===Paleopathology===
Some plesiosaur fossils show [[pathologies]], the result of illness or old age. In 2012, a [[mandible]] was described with a jaw joint clearly afflicted by [[arthritis]], a typical sign of [[senescence]].<ref>Sassoon, J., Noe, L.F. and Benton, M.J., 2012, "Cranial anatomy, taxonomic implications and palaeopathology of an Upper Jurassic pliosaur (Reptilia: Sauropterygia) from Westbury, Wiltshire, UK", ''Palaeontology'' doi: 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2012.01151.x</ref>

==Distribution==
Plesiosaurs have been found on every continent, including [[Antarctica]].<ref>Chatterjee, Sankar, Small, Brian J. and Nickell, M. W.; 1984. Late Cretaceous marine reptiles from Antarctica; Antarctic Journal of the United States; 19 (5); 7-8</ref>

== Plesiosaurs in contemporary culture ==
{{Main | Loch Ness Monster }}
{{See also | Sea monster}}
It has been suggested that [[legend]]s of [[sea serpent]]s and modern sightings of supposed [[lake monster|monsters in lakes]] or the sea could be explained by the survival of plesiosaurs into modern times. This [[cryptozoological]] proposal has been rejected by the [[scientific community]] at large, which considers it to be based on fantasy and [[pseudoscience]]. Purported plesiosaur carcasses have been shown to be partially decomposed corpses of [[basking shark]]s instead.<ref>Anonymous (AP Report). Japanese scientist says that sea creature could be related to a shark species. New York Times 1977 July 26.</ref><ref>[http://paleo.cc/paluxy/plesios.htm Sea-monster or Shark: An Alleged Plesiosaur Carcass]</ref><ref>Kimura S, Fujii K, and others. The morphology and chemical composition of the horny fiber from an unidentified creature captured off the coast of New Zealand. In CPC 1978, pp 67-74.</ref>

While the [[Loch Ness monster]] is often reported as looking like a plesiosaur, it is also often described as a creature that looks nothing like a plesiosaur. A number of reasons have been presented why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include the assumption that the water in the lake is too cold for a presumed [[Ectothermy|cold-blooded]] reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals would be easy to see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe,<ref>The Great Sea Serpent, Antoon Cornelis Oudemans, 2009, Cosimo Inc isbn 978-1-60520-332-4 p321</ref> the fact that the lake is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed ten thousand years ago at the end of the last [[ice age]], while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 65 million years ago.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19225764.900-why-the-loch-ness-monster-is-no-plesiosaur.html Why the Loch Ness Monster is no plesiosaur - life - 02 November 2006 - New Scientist]</ref> Frequent explanations for the sightings include [[wave]]s, floating inanimate objects, tricks of the light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes.<ref>[http://www.crawley-creatures.com/recent/lucy.htm Crawley Creatures]</ref> Nevertheless, in the popular imagination plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs really did exist and are not mythical or fantasy creatures.<ref>Ellis (2003), p. 1-3</ref>
