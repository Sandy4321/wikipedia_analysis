'''Past life regression''' (PLR) is a therapeutic technique that uses light levels of [[hypnosis]] to activate memories, or pseudo-memories, that appear to represent [[reincarnation|past lives]]. PLR is typically undertaken either in pursuit of a [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience, or in a therapeutic setting where it can be used in an attempt to resolve emotional, [[Psychological trauma|psychological]] or psychosomatic problems. Skeptics suggest that the "memories" are hypnotic [[confabulation|confabulations]] rather than genuine memories of past lives.  Some therapists claim that PLR has spiritual and therapeutic value regardless of the empirical validity of the memories.

== History ==
PLR therapy has been developed since the 1950s by a number of professional psychologists and psychiatrists from the US, UK and Australia. The key researchers, and their published findings, are Alexander Cannon<U+2019>s ''The Power Within'' (1950), Denys Kelsey<U+2019>s ''Many Lifetimes'' (1967), Morris Netherton<U+2019>s ''Past Lives Therapy'' (1978), Edith Fiore<U+2019>s ''You Have Been Here Before'' (1978), Helen Wambach<U+2019>s ''Reliving Past Lives'' (1978), Hans Ten Dam's ''Exploring Reincarnation'' (1983), [[Roger Woolger|Roger Woolger]]'s ''Other Lives, Other Selves'' (1988) and Brian Weiss<U+2019> ''Many Lives, Many Masters'' (1988).

More recently [[Andy Tomlinson|Andy Tomlinson<U+2019>s]] ''Healing the Eternal Soul'' (2006) and Hans TenDam<U+2019>s ''Deep Healing'' (1996) have described how PLR therapy can be integrated with current life regression in [[regression therapy]].

==The elements of the PLR experience==
Many PLR therapists use light trance and guided imagery to enable [[reincarnation|past lives]] to emerge. Some therapists also use bridging techniques from a client<U+2019>s current life problem to bring past life stories to conscious awareness.<ref>Andy Tomlinson, ''Healing the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2006, ch 3, p 35-53.</ref> Most past life stories do not actually relate to famous people and contain few historical details, although occasionally subjects come up with a plethora of names, dates and places that can be checked.<ref>Ramster, Peter, ''The Search for Lives Past'', Somerset Films and Pub, 1990 </ref>

Recollections of past lives are normally relevant to clients, who often perceive similar patterns in their current lives. An example is an irrational sense of responsibility for the deaths of others, carried over from the death of loved ones in a past life.<ref>Iseman, Esther, ''Regression Therapy as an Adjunct To Marriage Counseling: A Case Study'', ''Journal of Regression Therapy'', Vol 18, 1, 2008.</ref> Other patterns can take the form of a strong emotion (i.e. fear, anger, guilt), an associated thought, or body sensation (i.e. sexual block, skin rash). It has been suggested that these unresolved wounds from a past life may be the cause of present day complexes.<ref>Woolger, Roger, ''Healing your Past Lives'', Sounds True, 2004, ch3, p. 28.</ref>

==The therapeutic value of PLR ==
Most of the pioneers were previously either Christian, agnostic or atheist. Nearly all claim that they were profoundly skeptical at the outset, but gradually became convinced because of the results of PLR as therapeutic tool.<ref>Lawton, Ian, ''The Book of the Soul'', Rational Spirituality Press, 2004, ch 4, p. 73.</ref> According to proponents, PLR has produced dramatic, rapid and permanent improvements in some clients who had spent years in conventional therapy.<ref>Wooger, Roger, ''Other Lives, Other Selves'', Thorsons, 1987, ch 1, p. 15.</ref>

A more formal survey was conducted by Hazel Denning, who examined the effects of PLR on nearly 1000 subjects between 1985 and 1992. Results were measured just after the therapy, with a follow up five years afterwards. Of the 450 subjects who could still be tracked, 24% reported the troublesome symptoms had completely gone, 23% reported considerable or dramatic improvement and 17% reported noticeable improvement.<ref>Snow, Chet, ''Past-life Therapy: The Experiences of Twenty-Six Therapists<U+201D>, ''Journal of Regression Therapy'' 1:2 ,1986.</ref>  It should be noted, however, that [[self report study|self-report studies]] of this type, using patients who are aware of their treatment status, are considered the weakest type of evidence for treatment effectiveness.<ref>Maguire, Una, ''Counselling effectiveness: a critical discussion'', Brit. J. Guidance Counselling 1:38-50, 1973.</ref>

==The reality of lives recalled under PLR==
Arguments in favor of the reality of past lives were shown in Australian psychologist Peter Ramster<U+2019>s documentary ''The Reincarnation Experiments'' (1983) and the accompanying book.<ref>Ramster, Peter, ''The Search for Lives Past'', Somerset Films and Pub, 1990</ref>

Although most of the PLR pioneers saw genuine past lives as the natural explanation of the phenomena they observed, the apparent success of past life regression therapy does not necessarily indicate that the memories have any basis in reality.  Skeptics such as [[Ian Wilson (Christianity) | Ian Wilson]],<ref>Wilson, Ian ''The After Death Experience'', William Morrow and Company, 1989 and ''Mind out of Time'', Improver Press 2002.</ref> Paul Edwards<ref>Edwards, Paul, ''Reincarnation'' Prometheus Books, 2001</ref> and Melvin Harris<ref>Harris, Melvin, ''Investigating the Unexplained'', Prometheus Books, 2003</ref> have argued that past lives revealed by regression are nothing more than narratives that the subconscious creates using a mixture of imagination and normally acquired information that has been forgotten. This is properly referred to as [[cryptomnesia]]. Harris, for example, showed evidence  that the celebrated <U+201C>Bloxham Tapes<U+201D> were based on ''fictional'' sources that the subject, Jane Evans, had previously read and then forgotten.<ref>Harris, Melvin, ''Investigating the Unexplained'' Prometheus Books, 2003, ch 18.</ref><ref>Lawton has since argued that in at least one of the three lives recalled by Jane, the fictional source proffered by Harris did not contain many of the obscure details of the past life.  See Lawton, Ian, [http://www.ianlawton.com/plr1.htm ''The Bloxham Tapes Revisited: Why cryptomnesia is not the complete explanation''] and ''Journal of Regression Therapy'', '''18''':1(38-52), July 2008.</ref>

==Life between lives regression==

'''Life between lives regression''' (LBL regression) is an extension of more traditional past life regression that uses deeper levels of  [[hypnosis]] to take a person into what appear to be soul memories ''between'' lives. It<U+2019>s alternatively been referred to as <U+201C>interlife<U+201D> or <U+201C>spiritual regression<U+201D>. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, Glossary, p170/171</ref> Many of the pioneering professionals involved have found it helps a client to understand their spiritual purpose for this life. Skeptics suggest it<U+2019>s the product of a person<U+2019>s imagination, while its supporters claim that LBL regression provides the most accurate picture yet obtained of what happens after death.

LBL regression has been progressively developed since the late 1960s by a number of professional psychologists and psychiatrists. The key researchers and their published findings are Helen Wambach<U+2019>s ''Life Before Life'' (1979), Edith Fiore<U+2019>s ''You Have Been Here Before'' (1978), Peter Ramster<U+2019>s ''The Truth about Reincarnation'' (1980) and ''The Search for Lives Past'' (1990), Joel Whitton<U+2019>s ''Life Between Life'' (1986), Dolores Cannon<U+2019>s ''Between Death and Life'' (1993) and Shakuntala Modi<U+2019>s ''Remarkable Healings'' (1997). However ''the'' undoubted pioneer is [[Michael Newton (hypnotist)|Michael Newton]], who reported on his three decades of research in ''Journey of Souls'' (1994) and ''Destiny of Souls'' (2000). All of these pioneers are from the US except for Ramster, who is Australian.

More recent follow-up work in the UK has been published by [[Ian Lawton]] in ''The Book of the Soul'' (2004) and ''The Wisdom of the Soul'' (2007), and by [[Andy Tomlinson]] in ''Healing the Eternal Soul'' (2006) and ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'' (2007).

The pioneer<U+2019>s report of thousands of subjects show a remarkably consistency of experiencing the main elements of an LBL regression. <ref> Lawton, ''The Book of the Soul'', Rational Spirituality Press, 2004, ch 4, 5, 6 </ref> Many clients had no prior knowledge of what to expect and had previous beliefs that ranged from atheism through all the world<U+2019>s major religions. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, Introduction, p6 </ref> 

However, skeptics such as Paul Edwards argue that such experiences are just as fanciful as those that emerge from [[past life regression]], and that they are equally the product of vivid imaginations. <ref>Edwards, ''Reincarnation'' Prometheus Books, (2002), chapter 15, p. 249</ref>

LBL regressions have a profound effect on a person<U+2019>s conscious mind because it enables then to have a deep insight into their soul<U+2019>s current life purpose. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2006, ch9, p154-157.</ref> This helps them create a more positive way of thinking in their relationship to others, making life choices and in coping with the pressures of modern life. <ref> ''European Journal of Clinical Hypnosis - Journal of the British Association of Medical Hypnosis'', vol 7, issue 2, p 18 to 25, article ''Beyond Past Lives'' by Andy Tomlinson </ref>

===The elements of the LBL experience===
The techniques for LBL regression have been widely published. <ref> Newton, ''Life Between Lives; Hypnotherapy for Spiritual Regression'', Llewellyn, 2004. </ref> The pioneers and therapists trained by them have had consistent reports from what amount to thousands of clients, <ref> Tomlinson, ''Healing the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2006, p9 </ref> and based on this the LBL regression can be categorize into five elements: <ref> Lawton, ''The Wisdom of the Soul'', Rational Spirituality Press, 2007, Introduction, pp. 6-10 and Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, chapters 1-4, 6 and 8. </ref> 
*'''Transition and healing''' 
LBL subjects talk about leaving the past life body and like [[near death experience]]s <ref> Cannon, ''Between Death and Life'', Gateway, 1993, ch1, p12-13</ref> being met by deceased friends or family, or other spirits of light who aid the transition into the <U+201C>spirit world<U+201D>. <ref> Newton, ''Journey of Souls'', Llewellyn, 2004, ch 3 </ref>  Some level of energy healing takes place <ref> Rampster, ''The Truth About Reincarnation'', Rigby, 1980, ch6, and Modi, ''Memories of God and Creation'', Hampton Roads, 2000, ch 3. </ref> that invigorate and lighten them, and wash away many of the stresses and strains of the physical world. It seems that denser emotions and energies associated with the physical world have to be shed to allow them to re-enter the higher frequency vibrations of the spirit world. 
*'''Past life review''' 
The idea of reviewing a life is common to not only LBL regression but also near death experiences <ref> Moody, ''Life After Life, Bantam, 1976) </ref>.  In a LBL regression the past life review can be assisted by <U+201C>spirit guides<U+201D> <ref> Newton, ''Journey of Souls'', Llewellyn, 2004, ch 8 </ref>, or various <U+201C>elders<U+201D> <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, ch 3. </ref> that are evolved souls who help plot a path through successions of lives. Apparently the only judgment in this review process comes from the subjects themselves, because all their actions and intentions are laid bare. <ref> Whitton, ''Life Between Life'', Warner Books, 1988, ch4. </ref>
*'''Soul group interaction''' 
Subjects report that they have <U+201C>soul groups<U+201D> <ref> Newton, ''Destiny of Souls'', Llewellyn, 2000, ch 5 </ref> with whom they work closely over many lives, although the relationships vary from lovers to family members to friends. Reuniting with them is always described as a profoundly moving experience in which the subject finally feels that they are <U+201C>coming home<U+201D>. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, ch 4, p78 </ref> 
*'''Next-life planning''' 
At some point subjects report that before their return to the next life at the very least they tend to have an awareness of who their parents will be, and of where they live and what their circumstances are. <ref> Newton, ''Journey of Souls'', Llewellyn, 2004, chapter 13 </ref> Some are even given a preview of several different lives, and are asked to choose the one that will provide the best environment for growth. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Exploring the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2007, ch 6 </ref> Apparently these glimpses of the future merely represent the most probable outcome if they stick to their life plan, because they still have complete free will to stray from this once in the physical world. 
*'''Returning''' 
Subjects report that when they reincarnate they leave some soul energy behind in the spirit world to carry on with various other activities, but they also take with them specific emotions they want to carry on working with, and even past-life strengths that they may need to help them. <ref> Tomlinson, ''Healing the Eternal Soul'', O Books, 2006, ch7, p121-125 </ref> Subjects add that their soul energy can begin to merge with the unborn child in the womb at any time from conception to birth, and that this is a gradual and sometimes difficult process. <ref> Newton, ''Journey of Souls'', Llewellyn, 2004, ch 15 </ref>
