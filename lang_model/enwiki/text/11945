'''Ovaltine''' is a brand of [[milk]] flavoring product made with [[malt]] extract (except the blue packaging in the US), [[sugar]] (except in Switzerland), and [[whey]]. Some flavors also have [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]].  Ovaltine, a registered [[trademark]] of [[Associated British Foods]], is made by Wander AG, a subsidiary of [[Twinings]] which acquired the brand from [[Novartis]] in 2003, except in the United States, where [[Nestl<U+00E9>]] acquired the rights separately from Novartis later on. 

==History==
[[Image:Jar-and-Cup-Ovaltine-2006.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A jar of Ovaltine from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (2006), a mug of ovaltine made with hot milk and a tablespoon of the powder.]]

Ovaltine was developed in Berne, Switzerland, where it is known by its original name, '''Ovomaltine''' (from ''ovum'', Latin for "egg", and ''malt'', originally its main ingredients). Soon after invention the factory moved out to the village of [[Neuenegg]] a few kilometers west of Berne, where it is still produced.

Ovomaltine was exported to Britain in 1909; it was a misspelling in the trademark registration that led to the name being shortened to ''Ovaltine'' in English-speaking markets.  A factory was built in [[Kings Langley]] which exported to the United States as well. By 1915 Ovaltine was being manufactured in [[Villa Park, Illinois]], for the US market. Originally advertised as consisting solely of "malt, milk, eggs, flavored with cocoa", the formulation has changed over the decades, and today several formulations are sold in different parts of the world.

The popular chocolate malt version is a powder which is mixed with hot or cold [[milk]] as a beverage. ''Malt'' Ovaltine (a version without cocoa) and ''Rich Chocolate'' Ovaltine (a version without malt) are also available in some markets. Ovaltine has also been available in the form of [[candy bar|chocolate bars]], chocolate Easter eggs, parfait, cookies, and breakfast cereals, where it is only the brand name that connects the cereals with the chocolate drink.

Ovaltine also manufactured [[PDQ Chocolate]] Flavor Beads, PDQ Choco Chips and Egg Nog Flavored PDQ, which are no longer available. These [[drink mix]]es were very popular from the 1960s to the 1980s. Ovaltine discontinued the PDQ products about 1995 or 1996.

The US children's radio series ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (1931<U+2013>1940) and ''[[Captain Midnight]]'' (1938<U+2013>1949), and the subsequent ''Captain Midnight'' TV series (1954<U+2013>1956), were sponsored by Ovaltine. They had promotions in which listeners could save [[Proof of purchase|proofs-of-purchase]] from Ovaltine jars to obtain [[radio premiums]], like "[[secret decoder ring]]" badges or pins that could be used to decode messages in the program. Children from the time may remember that "Ovaltine" is an anagram for "Vital One". 

Another radio program aimed at five- to fourteen-year-olds, ''The League of [[Ovaltineys]]'', was broadcast to Great Britain by [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] on Sunday evenings at 5:30 PM. Beginning in 1934, it was broadcast until 1940 and the German occupation of Luxembourg and again after [[World War II]] ended into the 1950s. Like the US program, listeners could obtain badges, pins, and secret codes. The Ovaltineys' advertising jingle was regarded as one of the most successful jingles of the era.<ref>Street, Sean. Crossing the ether: pre-war public service radio and commercial competition in the UK. 2006, Indiana University Press, pp. 112-113</ref>

Villa Park, Illinois, was home to the Ovaltine factory until the company's purchase and withdrawal in 1988. The Villa Park Historical Society maintains a permanent exhibit of Ovaltine advertising and memorabilia. The old factory was converted to loft apartments keeping the original floors and wall exposed.

In 1992 Himmel Group obtained the right to make and sell Ovaltine in the US from Sandoz Nutrition Corporation.  In 2007 Himmel sold their rights to Novartis.  Presently Nestle has those rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.himmelgroup.com/brands/Ovaltine.html |title=Brands &#124; Ovaltine |publisher=The Himmel Group |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref> With this purchase, Nestle immediately ceased Ovaltine's previous television advertising campaign targeted to older and nostalgic audiences, where Ovaltine was presented as more nutritious than former competitor [[Nesquik]], and though it is still sold widely in the United States, Ovaltine is currently not advertised on American television.

==International appeal==
[[File:Kings Langley, Former Ovaltine factory - geograph.org.uk - 272923.jpg|thumb|200|Former Ovaltine factory, Kings Langley. This is the listed art deco fa<U+00E7>ade of the former Ovaltine factory. It was redeveloped into housing in 2002.]]

Ovaltine was also very popular in Britain, and was manufactured at [[Kings Langley]] in Hertfordshire using a process that included GEA Wiegand falling film evaporators to concentrate liquid malt extract which was then dried under vacuum in steam heated band dryers. The [[art deco]] style Ovaltine factory in Kings Langley is a well-known local landmark. Production ceased in 2002 and the factory has now been redeveloped as luxury apartments. Near the factory was a health farm run by the Ovaltine works which was set up as a model farm and a health resort for disadvantaged children, which operated through to the 1960s. Later the farm land was sold off and is now largely occupied by the [[M25 motorway]].  The Ovaltine Egg Farm is now the site of [[Renewable Energy Systems]] Ltd. and the site of the first [[wind turbine]] visible from the M25.

In October 2002 the food and drinks division of [[Novartis]], the maker of Ovaltine, was bought by [[Associated British Foods]]. ABF currently produces Ovaltine in Switzerland, China and Thailand. In the United States [[Nestl<U+00E9>]] manufactures Ovaltine, using a trade dress in cursive writing instead of print.

In [[Hong Kong]], Ovaltine, like [[Horlicks]], is known as a caf<U+00E9> drink. It is served at ''[[cha chaan teng]]s'' as well as fast-food shops such as [[Caf<U+00E9> de Coral]] and [[Maxim's Catering|Maxim's Express]]. It is served hot, or on ice as a cold drink. In Hong Kong the powder is sold without sugar, to be sweetened to taste by the consumer. In Brazil it is commonly mixed with vanilla ice cream. In the Asian market, it is a chocolate ice cream flavoured with Ovaltine powder. The Ovomaltine brand is highly recognizable in Switzerland, and the brand is associated with [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]].

In Malaysia, Ovaltine has lost its popularity to [[Nestl<U+00E9> Milo]].  Ovaltine is sold in [[tetra pack]]s for cold serving and widely available in shops and supermarkets, yet it has a low profile compared to similar beverages in the market. In Japan, Ovaltine was sold for a short period in the late 1970s by [[Calpis]] Industries (presently Calpis Co., Ltd.), but it was not a commercial success. In Australia, [[Ovalteenies]] are sold as round tablets of compressed Ovaltine, eaten as a [[candy]].

Brazilian fast food chain [[Bob's]], the largest competitor to [[McDonald's]] in that country, offers, since 1959, [[milkshake]]s and [[sundae]]s made with Ovaltine, which became a flagship product of the fast-food chain in [[Brazil]]. Brazil has the second largest Ovaltine factory, in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], and is the second largest consumer market for the product, after [[Thailand]]. The Brazilian Ovaltine is unlike any other in the world, originating from an assembly line malfunction that made the powder [[crispiness|crispier]], and is still maintained today.<ref>[[Globonews]]. ''Mundo S/A''. "Erro na receita do Ovomaltine agradou paladar dos brasileiros".</ref>

==In popular culture==

In 1947, [[Harry Gibson]]'s song "Who Put the [[Benzedrine]] in Mrs. Murphy's Ovaltine" was popular on the radio. Ovaltine is mentioned in at least three songs from Broadway shows <U+2014> "[[Marry the Man Today]]" from ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', "[[You're the Top]]" from ''[[Anything Goes]]'', and "[[Go Into Your Trance]]" from ''[[High Spirits (musical)|High Spirits]]''. ("You need no drinks, you need no smokes, you need no aspirin in your Cokes <U+2014> No benzedrine in your Ovaltine <U+2014> Just go, go, go into your trance.")

Ovaltine and its advertisements are one of the relics of Previous society in [[Jasper Fforde]]'s novel [[Shades of Grey 1: The Road to High Saffron|"Shades of Grey"]].

One of the segments of ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' has Ralphie anxiously decoding the secret message on the ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' radio program, only to discover it's no more than an encouragement to drink Ovaltine.

Ovaltine is mentioned in the intentionally nostalgic song "Do You Remember These?" by the [[Statler Brothers]]. ("Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair Captain Midnight, Ovaltine and The Whip at the County Fair...")

The song "Mankind" by [[Pearl Jam]] also mentions Ovaltine ("I'll be playing with my magazine, using up my Listerine, like Ovaltine").

Ovaltine was mentioned by the British crime fiction writer [[Patricia Wentworth]] in several of her novels about [[Miss Silver]]. The beverage is usually taken by heroines before they go to sleep.

In the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', Frau Blucher asks Dr. Frankenstein if he would like something to drink. He says no. She offers him a short list of things, concluding in Ovaltine, which he also refuses.

In the fifth season finale of [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|''Supernatural'' (TV series)]], after killing several demons with his mind, Lucifer asks Sam "chock full of Ovaltine are we?".

In "[[The Fatigues]]" episode of ''Seinfeld'', one of Jerry's acquaintances and struggling comic, Kenny Bania, played by Steve Hytner, reads an attempt at observational humor that Jerry wrote for him: "Why do they call it Ovaltine?  The jar is round; the mug is round. They should call it 'roundtine'."

Ovaltine is mentioned in [[Wole Soyinka]]'s play "The Trial's of Brother Jero".

[[Nas]] mentions "Ovaltine shakes" in "Play on Playa" on the album ''[[Hip Hop Is Dead]]''.

Ovaltine is mentioned in Dennis Potter's "The Singing Detective" in the sentence by sister White: "Coffee or Ovaltine?".
