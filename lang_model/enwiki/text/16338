'''The World Association of Nuclear Operators''' ('''WANO''') is an international non-profit, technical support organisation that encourages all commercial [[nuclear power plant]] operators with an operating commercial nuclear power plant to achieve the highest possible standards of [[nuclear safety]].

WANO was established in 1989 as a response to the [[Chernobyl disaster]] with the aim of preventing such events in future. Based in London with regional centres in [[Moscow]], [[Atlanta]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Paris]], the organisation exists purely to help its members accomplish the highest levels of operational safety and reliability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centres|url=http://www.wano.info/our-members/|publisher=World Association of Nuclear Operators|accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref>  This is achieved through a series of programmes which include peer reviews, technical support and access to a global library of operating experience, reports and publications.

WANO members accept collective responsibility for nuclear safety and understand that the industry is only as strong as its weakest member. While WANO works directly with its members, the organisation is not a regulatory body and does not advise companies on issues such as initial reactor design selection.

== Mission ==

"To maximize the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide by working together to assess, benchmark and improve performance through mutual support, exchange of information and emulation of best practice."

== History ==

Following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], nuclear operators worldwide were determined to work together to ensure such a disaster could never happen again. From this, WANO emerged and formally came into being on May 15, 1989 during an inaugural meeting in Moscow. Below is a look at some key moments in WANO<U+2019>s history:

=== 1986 - 1989 ===

'''April 1986''' - At Chernobyl-4, a severe reactivity excursion is experienced at an [[RBMK]]-1000 reactor in the then [[Soviet Union]]. This occurs during the performance of a turbine-generator coast-down test. Insufficient management control, inappropriate use of procedures, human error and design problems contribute to the worst disaster experienced by any nuclear power plant. Public confidence in the use of nuclear energy is badly shaken throughout the world.

'''October 1987''' - The [[International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electric Energy]] (UNIPEDE) and the [[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]] (INPO) co-sponsor the International Nuclear Utility Executive Meeting in Paris. [[<U+00C9>lectricit<U+00E9> de France]] (EDF) hosts the meeting, which is chaired by Lord Walter Marshall of Goring, Chairman of the United Kingdom<U+2019>s [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Thirty of the world<U+2019>s 32 countries that have nuclear power plants operating or under construction are represented.

The utility executives form steering and implementation committees to plan for a worldwide association of nuclear operators. Soviet Minister Nickolai Lukonin agrees to consider whether the inaugural meeting can be held in Moscow. The purpose of the association will be to exchange operating experience throughout the international nuclear community.

'''May 1989''' <U+2013> WANO<U+2019>s inaugural meeting is held in Moscow and hosted by Minister Nickolai Lukonin, who is recognised as the first President of the association.
'''August''' - WANO Atlanta Centre co-ordinates its first exchange between [[Catawba Nuclear Power Plant]] (USA) and [[Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant]] (Ukraine).
'''November''' <U+2013> The WANO Charter is signed by 144 companies, committing them to work in support of the WANO mission. Lord Marshall is named Chairman of the Governing Board and William S. Lee, [[Duke Energy|Duke Power Company]], USA, is elected as President to serve until the first Biennial General Meeting. Minister Lukonin accepts a challenge to organise two-way exchange visits between every Moscow Centre plant and a plant of another centre within two years.

=== 2011 - present ===

'''11 March 2011''' <U+2013> A [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami|9.0 magnitude earthquake]] strikes off the coast of [[Honshu]], Japan. The resulting tsunamis engulf [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]]<U+2019>s [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]], starting a chain of events that eventually leads to core damage in three of its reactors and offsite releases of radioactivity. The event is eventually classified as a level 7, the most severe level of disaster on the international nuclear event scale. Only the [[Chernobyl disaster]] has been more severe. WANO offices commence communicating event information to its members and marshalling resources to support TEPCO.

Six days after the event, WANO issues Significant Operating Experience Report (SOER) 2011-2 <U+2013> Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Station Fuel Damage Caused by Earthquake and Tsunami, for members<U+2019> urgent responses.

On '''31 March''', WANO establishes a Post-Fukushima Commission to determine lessons for the organisation following the disaster. The Commission is tasked with reporting back to its findings and recommendations to members by the Shenzhen BGM in October 2011.

'''26 April''' <U+2013> The world marks 25 years since the Chernobyl disaster.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting, members unanimously support the recommendations of the Post-Fukushima Commission approved the previous day by the WANO Governing Board. The recommendations include expanding the scope of WANO activities; developing a worldwide integrated event response strategy, improving WANO<U+2019>s credibility including changes to WANO<U+2019>s peer reviews and corporate peer reviews; improving visibility; and improving the quality and consistency of WANO<U+2019>s products and services worldwide.

'''16 May 2012''' - At the recent WANO Governing Board meeting in Moscow, Mr Robert F. Willard replaced Mr James O. Ellis, Jr on the WANO Governing Board.
