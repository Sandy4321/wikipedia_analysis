'''Dean Austin''' (born 26 April 1970 in [[Hemel Hempstead]]) is an [[England|English]] former  [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (football)|defender]]. 

He started his career at [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans]] and went on to play for [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He retired after the 2002-03 season while at [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] and has since worked as a coach.

==Club career==
===Early career===
At the age of 12, Dean managed to get on the [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] books and also played for Sunday League side [[Forest United]]. At the age of 17, he came back to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and played for the under-18s. He then joined non-league side [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]].

===Southend===
Austin was signed by [[Southend United F.C.|Southend]] manager [[David Webb]] from [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans]] for <U+00A3>14,000 in 1990 and made his debut on 10 April, as the [[Southend United F.C.|Shrimpers]] held [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] to a 0-0 draw.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.shrimperzone.com/news/archives/february03/poll080203.shtml
|title=ShrimperZone.com}}{{deadlink|date=September 2010}}</ref> He went on to play the last 7 games of the [[1989-90 in English football|1989/90 season]] as [[Southend United F.C.|Southend]] were automatically promoted to the Third division <ref>{{cite web
|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989-90_in_English_football#Fourth_Division_2
|title=1989-90 in English football|publisher=Wikipedia}}</ref> after defeating [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]] 2-0 on the final day of the season. He scored his first goal for the club on 4 September 1990 in the [[Football League Cup|Rumblelows Cup]] against [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]]. In the [[1990-91 in English football|1990/91 season]] he received an injury and was forced to miss out on the beginning of the season, but after recovering he became an integral part of the team as [[Southend United F.C.|Southend]] just missed out on the Division 3 title. He scored two more goals for [[Southend United F.C.|Southend]] in the [[1991-92 in English football|1991/92 season]], both in the league. Southend had briefly topped the Second Division after the early [[Boxing Day]] games but eventually fell away to mid table in their first season at this level, ending hopes of a unqiue third successive promotion and a place in the new [[FA Premier League]].<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/southend_united_fc_history.html]</ref>

His form attracted interest from bigger clubs and midway through the season [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] approached Austin, Dean feeling he could hold out for bigger clubs. He ended up being signed by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], the club he supported as a child by manager [[Terry Venables]] for <U+00A3>375,000. In all competitions, he had made 109 appearances for [[Southend United F.C.|Southend]], scoring three goals.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-kickoff-9293--perils-of-a-tv-game-show-footballs-televised-revolution-finally-comes-to-fruition-today-amid-fears-that-the-game-could-be-devalued-in-the-longterm-joe-lovejoy-football-correspondent-sets-the-scene-for-the-new-season-and-evaluates-the-competing-claims-of-the-22-premier-league-clubs-1540336.html]</ref>

===Tottenham===
Dean made his debut on 22 August 1992. His first season at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] was rather successful, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] finished in 8th place. But then, in 1993 [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] took over and with his 5-man attacking line-up Austin wasn't given much of a chance in the team and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] only just avoided relegation. However, next season he was back in the team and under [[Gerry Francis]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] reached the semi-final of the [[FA Cup 1994-95|FA Cup]], only to lose to eventual winners [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4-1.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Match Report: Tottenham v Everton, 1994-95 (FA Cup SF)|work=ToffeeWeb}}</ref> However, in 1996 he had serious knee injuries which limited his appearances in the team and in 1998 he was sold to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. In all competitions, he made 154 appearances for Tottenham and did not score a single goal. In a [[Times Online]] article in 2007, he was named number 35 on the list of 50 worst [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] footballers.<ref>{{cite news

===Crystal Palace===
Austin linked up with former manager [[Terry Venables]] at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Palace]], although Venables only stayed for six months. After not playing for 18 months, Austin failed to find his place in the team until several players left because of the [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Eagles']] financial troubles <ref>{{cite web
|url=http://tonyd.users.netlink.co.uk/reviews/rev_98-9.htm
|title=Crystal Palace FC Season Review - 98/99|publisher=Tony Dudley}}</ref>, opening the door for Austin. He marked his return to the club by scoring the winner against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://tonyd.users.netlink.co.uk/f98/cp_fixnon.htm
|title=Crystal Palace FC Fixtures/Results 1998/99|publisher=Tony Dudley}}</ref>. The club, however went into administration in 1999 and defied the odds, staying up in Division 1 despite being tipped to go down. He was later named club captain and then joined [[Woking F.C.|Woking]]. There were also rumours of him returning to [[Roots Hall]].

===Woking===
Austin spent the last season of his career with [[Woking F.C.|Woking]]. He was appointed club captain by manager [[Glenn Cockerill]] as the club narrowly avoided relegation from the [[Conference National]]. At the age of 33 he was unable to sign a new deal,<ref>{{cite news

==Coaching career==
In May 2007 Austin rejoined his old club [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] as a coach under [[Steve Tilson]]. In November 2008, Austin joined up with the newly-appointed [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] manager, [[Brendan Rodgers]] as his assistant, and followed Rodgers to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] the following August.
