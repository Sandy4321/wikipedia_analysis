==A brief history==
From the time of its inception in {{by|1943}} until the time of its demise in {{by|1954}}, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League included some six hundred young women who were recruited from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Cuba]]. The league was created by [[Chicago Cubs]] owner and chewing gum magnate [[Philip K. Wrigley]] as a way of maintaining baseball's popularity during [[World War II]] when [[Major League Baseball]] players were off serving in [[World War II]]. Early in the 1944 season, it became evident that the war would not force the major leagues to disband, and Wrigley lost interest in the girls' league. Before the 1945 season, Wrigley decided to sell the league to [[Arthur Meyerhoff]], a Chicago advertising executive. Hitting was sparse in the early years until rule changes equalized the playing field after the 1949 season. While the game played eventually evolved to something similar to [[baseball]], the principal differences were in the size of the diamond, the [[pitcher|pitching]] styles and the size of the [[Baseball (ball)|ball]]. Between 1950 and 1954, the final years of the AAGPBL, talented ball players needed more training and experience for success in the circuit with its longer infield distances, smaller ball, and strong overhand pitching motion. At the end, the AAGPBL helped pave the way for the involvement of women in sports today.<ref name=AAGPBL-History>{{cite web |url=http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm |title= All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History}}</ref>

==Overview profile==
One of the most talented hitters in AAGPBL history, Joanne Weaver was the youngest of three sisters to play for the [[Fort Wayne Daisies]] in the final years of the league. Weaver often outdid her renowned sister, [[Betty Foss|Betty Weaver Foss]], as a power hitter, winning three consecutive batting titles and by setting several all-time records. At this point, the Weaver-Foss duet led the AAGPBL in most major offensive categories between 1952 and 1954. A three-time All-Star, Joanne earned Player of the Year honors in 1954, when she hit a .429 [[batting average|average]] to set an AAGPBL single-season record. Besides this, her .429 mark was the highest [[Professional baseball#Historic leagues|Professional American Baseball]] batting average collected by any player in a single season in a minimum of 300 [[at-bat]] appearances.<ref name=AAGPBL-History/><ref>The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League</ref>

==Early life== 
A native of [[Metropolis, Illinois]], Joanne Weaver was the daughter of a [[minor league baseball|Minor league]] [[pitcher]]. At age of 11, she began playing softball whit her sisters Betty and [[Jean Weaver|Jean]]. Their father tried to get them to play in a local boy's baseball team, with little success, until he managed to insert them into the Magnavox team of the Chicago industrial league, a successful [[fastpitch softball]] squad in which they finally started to play regularly. In 1950, Betty rejected a contract offer from the [[Chicago White Sox]] minor league system and opted to sign with the All-American Girls Professional Baseball. Betty was allocated to the Fort Wayne Daisies and her sisters joined her on the team a year later.<ref name=AAGPBL-Joanne-Weaver/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/players/index.cfm?do=player.details&playerid=608  All-American Girls Professional Baseball League - Betty Weaver Foss page]</ref><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/players/index.cfm?do=player.details&playerid=610 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League - Jean Weaver page]</ref> 
 
==AAGPBL career== 
Joanne Weaver debuted at third base with the Daisies in the 1951 season. She hit .276 in 53 games, showing a nice smooth quick swing with good speed and above average base running instincts. Her fielding was the only skill lacking. Meanwhile, her sister Betty won batting titles in back-to-back seasons in 1950 and 1951, helping Fort Wayne to make the playoffs in these years.<ref name=AAGPBL-Joanne-Weaver/><ref name=AAGPBL-Records>{{cite web |url=http://www.aagpbl.org/league/records.cfm |title= All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Records}}</ref>

But Weaver exploded in her sophomore season. After moving to right field in 1952, she led all hitters with a .344 average, surpassing her sister Betty (.331), who led five offensive categories and earned the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League#Player of the Year Award|Player of the Year Award]], while Joanne did not rank high in any other category. Both sisters were selected for the All-Star Team and helped Fort Wayne advance to the playoffs.<ref name=AAGPBL-Joanne-Weaver/><ref name=AAGPBL-Records/> 

Weaver improved her fielding considerably in 1953, when she finished the year with a .952 average. Her hitting stayed about the same, which was good enough to win another batting title win a .346 average, ending second to Betty in [[total bases]] (187) and [[hit (baseball)|hits]] (142, two behind). Joanne also finished third in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (79), [[stolen base]]s (70), and [[runs batted in]] (76). Fort Wayne added another playoff trip, and she made the All-Star Team again.<ref name=AAGPBL-Joanne-Weaver/><ref name=AAGPBL-Records/> 

During the 1954 midseason the AAGPBL reduced the [[baseball (ball)|ball]] from 10.00 inches to the major league size, around 9.00 inches. The league also extended pitching distance from 56 feet to 60 feet and base paths from 75 feet to 85 feet. As a result, Joanne was chosen [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League#Player of the Year Award|Player of the Year]] and made the All-Star Team for the third consecutive year after setting season-records with 29 [[home run]]s and 254 [[total base]]s, while leading the league in hits (143), runs (109) and stolen bases (79).  She finished second in [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (16) and [[triple (baseball)|triples]] (4), and joined [[Eleanor Callow]] as the only players in the league's history to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases during a regular season. Weaver also hit a league-lead .429, which remains the highest professional baseball batting average posted in the 20th century.<ref name=AAGPBL-Joanne-Weaver/><ref name=AAGPBL-Records/><ref>[http://www.aagpbl.org/league/rules.cfm All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Rules of Play]</ref>  

The Fort Wayne Daisies advanced to the best-of-five game Championship Series. Previously in the playoffs, the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]] dispatched the [[South Bend Blue Sox]] in three games and Fort Wayne did the same with the [[Grand Rapids Chicks]].<ref name=AAGPBL-History/><ref name=AAGPBL-Records/>

==1954 Championship Title==
In Game 1 of the AAGPBL Series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17-9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from [[June Peppas]], who also helped herself by hiting 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates [[Carol Habben]] and [[Fern Shollenberger]] also slugged one each, while [[Chris Ballingall]] added a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]. [[Katie Horstman]] connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause and [[Joanne Weaver]] slugged one. Pitching star [[Maxine Kline]], who had posted an 18-7 record with a 3.23 [[earned run average|ERA]] during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss.

The Daisies evened the Series against the Lassies winning Game 2, 11<U+2013>4, after hitting five home runs off two pitchers. [[Gloria Cordes]] started for Kalamazoo, but due to a mix-up over the game's starting time the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpires]] did not allow her to [[Warming up|warm up]] (supposedly there would be a half hour delay). Starting cold, Cordes allowed five runs before getting a batter out. After a leadoff [[base on balls|walk]], Horstman belted a home run for a 2<U+2013>0 Fort Wayne lead. Then [[Ruth Richard]] and [[Joanne Weaver]] hit back-to-back [[single (baseball)|singles]], and [[Betty Foss|Betty Weaver Foss]] hit a three-run homer for a 5-0 edge. [[Elaine Roth]] [[relief pitcher|relieved]] Cordes and completed the game. But the Lassies hit three more home runs, one each by [[Jean Geissinger]] and the '''Foss-Weaver''' sisters. Kalamazoo discounted the margin with leadoff homers by [[Nancy Mudge]], Peppas (playing at first base) and [[Dorothy Schroeder]], but the game's outcome was never in doubt.

In Game 3, the Daisies won the Lassies,  8<U+2013>7, fueled fueled again by a heavy hitting by [[Joanne Weaver]], who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs. Peppas went 1-for-4 to spark a seventh inning three-run rally, but Fort Wayne came back in the bottom of the inning with two two runs that marked the difference. Cordes relieved with the bases loaded in the seventh inning,  but did not allow any damage for the remainder of the game.  
 
In other close score, the Lassies evened the Series in Game 4 with a victory over the Daisies, 6<U+2013>5. Cordes started again with her team against the wall, 2-to-1. This time properly warmed up, she hurled a [[complete game]], allowing five runs on nine hits. Habben drove in two runs who marked the difference, while Kline suffered her second loss of the Series. Peppas contributed with a single, a double and one RBI in four at-bats.

In decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3-for-5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by a 8<U+2013>5 margin to gave the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Balingall (3-for-4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eight. Peppas finished with a .450 average and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the league's history. In the end, the inspired Lassies rose to the challenge and batted a .337 average as a team. On the other hand, the usually heavy-hitting Daisies averaged only .275.<ref name=AAGPBL-History/><ref>''All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book'' <U+2013> W. C. Madden.

The sisters Foss-Weaver were able to win the final five batting championships of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League and two Player of the Year awards. With [[Helen Callaghan]] winning the batting title in 1945, the Fort Wayne Daisies amassed six batting crowns to set a league record. But while Fort Wayne made the playoffs in the last seven seasons of the league, the team struggled in the post-season and never won a Championship Title. In 1952 and 1953, the Daisies were knocked out in the first round after posting the best regular-season record.<ref name=AAGPBL-Records/> 

==Bill Allington All-Stars==
Once the league disbanded in 1954, Joanne Weaver was one of eleven players selected by former Daisies [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Bill Allington]] to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans. The Allington All-Stars played 100 games between 1954 and 1958, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's [[station wagon]] and a [[Ford Country Sedan]]. Besides Weaver, the All-Americans included her sister [[Betty Foss]], [[Joan Berger]], [[Gloria Cordes]], [[Gertrude Dunn]], [[Jean Geissinger]], [[Katie Horstman]], [[Maxine Kline]], [[Dolores Lee]], [[Ruth Richard]] and [[Dorothy Schroeder]], among others.<ref>''Women in Baseball: The Forgotten History'' <U+2013> Gai Ingham Berlage, Charley Gerard.

==Life after baseball==
Following her baseball career, Joanne Weaver lived in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] for more than 30 years. In November of 1988, the Weaver sisters received their long overdue recognition when the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] dedicated a permanent display to the entire league rather than any individual player.<ref name=AAGPBL-History/> 

In 1990 Joanne moved back to her hometown of [[Metropolis, Illinois]] to be with her parents. Betty returned in 1994 while Jean did it in 1995, so the three Weavers got to see each other every day, like in the old times, for the rest of their lives. Betty died in 1998, at the age of 68, following complications related to [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] ([[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease), while Joanne died in 2000 at 64 years, of the same disease that claimed her sister. Eight years later, Jean died at age 74.<ref>[http://thediamondangle.com/archive/mar05/weaver.html|title=The Diamond Angle <U+2013> An interview with Jean Weaver]</ref>
