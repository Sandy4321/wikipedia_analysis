The '''Getty Conservation Institute''' (GCI), located in [[Los Angeles, California]], is a program of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]]. It is headquartered at the [[Getty Center]] but also has facilities at the [[Getty Villa]], and commenced operation in 1985.<ref name=GCI>J. Paul Getty Trust. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/institute/ About the Conservation Institute.] Retrieved May 2, 2011.</ref> The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It "serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field" and "adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access."<ref name=GCI/> GCI has activities in both [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]].<ref name=Adams>Adams, Eric. The Getty's conservation mission. ''Architecture'', December 1997, vol. 86, issue 12.</ref>

GCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation. It offers formal education and training programs, and it published a number of scholarly books.  GCI has supported field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage.

== Scientific projects ==
GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration.<ref name=GCIScience>Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/about/ About GCI Science.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.</ref>  One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections.<ref>Getty Conservation Institute.

In addition, GCI "conducts scientific research on materials' composition."<ref name=GCIScience/> For example, a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an "Atlas of Analytical Signatures of [[List of photographic processes|Photographic Processes]]" which will provide "a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed."<ref>Getty Conservation Institute.

== Education and training ==
Training of interested parties around the world is important for the sustainability of GCI's work.<ref name=Adams/> For example, GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course "to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human-made emergencies."<ref>Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/teamwork/ Teamwork for Integrated Emergency Management.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.</ref> Also, GCI developed a course on the "Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs" which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/about/|title=About GCI Education|publisher=Getty Trust|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>  Besides courses and workshops, GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a [[Master's degree]] program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref>A.M.H.S.

== Field projects ==
GCI's field projects are "selected based on how they fit the institute's goals of raising public awareness, contributing new, broadly applicable information to the field, and supporting cultural heritage" and "must be executed in collaboration with partners<U+2026> who must be serious about their efforts<U+2026> so that projects are assured of continuing after the Getty's involvement ceases."<ref name=Adams/> Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the [[Mogao Caves]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]] in China (announced in 1989);<ref>Wilson, David S.

== Dissemination of information ==
It has been stated that "perhaps the institute's most profound contribution to conservation is the dissemination of information and methods learned in the field."<ref name=Adams/> Methods of information dissemination include conferences; lectures; books; and online publications, newsletters, video, and audio.<ref>Getty Conservation Institute.
