{{Intelligent Design}}
The '''Discovery Institute''' is a [[think tank]] structured as a non-profit foundation, founded in [[1990]] and based in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[United States|USA]].  The stated mission of the organization is to, "make a positive vision of the future practical."<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/about.php About the Discovery Institute]</ref> However, the institute's practices, particularly its campaign promoting intelligent design and the religious goal outlined in the institute's [[Wedge strategy]] to "reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions"<ref name="wedge_and_response">"Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions." ... "If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a "wedge" that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points."[http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf Wedge Strategy] Discovery Institue, 1999. The institute's response to the leaking of the Wedge strategy, [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&program=CSC%20Responses&id=2101 The "Wedge Document": So What?] raises the same objection to the materialistic worldview: "We think the materialist world-view that has dominated Western intellectual life since the 19th century is false and we want to refute it. We further want to reverse the influence of such materialistic thinking on our culture."</ref> have placed it at the center of numerous controversies.

==History==
The '''Discovery Institute''' was founded in 1990 as a non-profit educational foundation and think tank based upon the Christian [[apologetics]] of [[C.S. Lewis]]. It was founded as a branch of the [[Hudson Institute]], an Indianapolis-based [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]], and is named after the [[Royal Navy]] ship [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']] in which [[George Vancouver]] explored [[Puget Sound]] in 1792.

In 1966 the institute's founder and president, [[Bruce Chapman]] and Harvard roommate [[George Gilder]], participated in the [[Ripon Society]], a group for Republican liberals, and collaborated  on ''Advance'', dubbed "the unofficial Republican magazine," which criticized the party from within for catering to segregationists, John Birchers, and other "extremists". Following their graduation, Chapman and Gilder advanced their "progressive" Republican campaign in their 1966 polemic book ''The Party That Lost Its Head''. The book critiqued Barry Goldwater<U+2019>s 1964 presidential candidacy and dismissed the GOP<U+2019>s embrace of rising star Ronald Reagan as the party's hope to "usurp reality with the fading world of the class-B movie." ''The Party That Lost Its Head'' denounced Goldwater<U+2019>s conservative backers for their "rampant" and "paranoid distrust" of  intellectuals. The book labeled the Goldwater campaign a "brute assault on the entire intellectual world," and places the blame for this development on what they viewed as a wrong political tactic: "In recent years the Republicans as a party have been alienating intellectuals deliberately, as a matter of taste and strategy." Chapman moved to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] in the [[Reagan administration]],<ref>[http://www.waronscience.com/excerpt.php Chapter 11: "Creation Science" 2.0, The Republican War on Science] [[Chris Mooney]]. Basic Books, 2005.</ref> where he served as director of the [[Census Bureau]]. Chapman left the Census Bureau to work in the White House under Reagan adviser [[Edwin Meese III]] - now a Discovery Institute Adjunct Fellow,<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/fellows/ Discovery Institute Fellows]</ref> and was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] Organizations in Vienna.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/po/com/12318.htm Official State Department Record of United Nations Office (Vienna)]</ref>

Co-founder and Senior Fellow George Gilder wrote several books addressing culture, technology, and poverty, including, <U+201C>Visible Man,<U+201D> (1978) which criticised American culture for its failure to promote the ideals of the traditional nuclear family.<ref>[http://www.gildertech.com/bios.html Gilder Technology Report]</ref> His next work, <U+201C>Wealth and Poverty,<U+201D> (1981), was cited by President [[Ronald Reagan]]<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=41324 Ronald Reagan Radio Address to the Nation, May 14, 1983]</ref><ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=37418 Ronald Reagan Radio Address to the Nation, July 7, 1983]</ref>. Gilder<U+2019>s later books have dealt more with developments in technology, such as <U+201C>Microcosm<U+201D> (1990) and <U+201C>Life After Television<U+201D> (1994).

By 1996, having formed a plan for a think tank opposed to materialism with [[Stephen C. Meyer]] and [[George Gilder]] in 1993-94, Chapman had secured money in the form of a grant from [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]] and the MacLellan Foundation. Meyer had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science and Meyer recalls being asked by Ahmanson "What could you do if you had some financial backing?"

The New York Times, August 21 2005.</ref> $750,000 over three years from the Ahmansons and a smaller grant from the conservative Christian MacLellan Foundation was used to fund the institute's '''[[Center for Science and Culture]]''', then called the '''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture''', which went on to form the motive force behind the [[intelligent design movement]].

==Organization==
The institute is headed by [[Bruce Chapman]], president.  Vice presidents are Steven J. Buri, and [[Stephen C. Meyer]] (who also serves as an institute senior fellow and the program director of the Center for Science and Culture).

Its board of directors includes notable social and religious conservative [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]], influential local businesspeople [http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/personinfo/FromMktGuideIdPersonTearsheet.jhtml?passedMktGuideId=35842 Tom Alberg], [http://www.baldwinrgi.com/home.html William Baldwin], [http://www.foster.com/attOverview.aspx?AttorneyID=112 Mike Vaska], opinion and policy makers like former U.S. Senator [[Slade Gorton]] and [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=25&isFellow=true Christopher Bayley].

===Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture===
{{main|Center for Science and Culture}}
The '''[[Center for Science and Culture]]''' (CSC), formerly known as the '''Center for Renewal of Science and Culture''' (CRSC), is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Institute<U+2019>s most important subsidiary is the CSC, established in 1996 with the assistance of [[Phillip E. Johnson]]  in order to advance the Wedge strategy. Chapman calls the CSC "our No. 1 project."<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_9_16/ai_60270494 Scientist Get a Wedgie]   Larry Witham. Insight on the News,  March 6 2000</ref>
<ref>[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/wedge.html The Wedge at Work] Chapter 1 of ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics''. [[Barbara Forrest]].  MIT Press, 2001.</ref> 

The CSC offers lucrative fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for "support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields."  Since its founding in 1996, the institute's CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can ponder intelligent design. Over those nine years, $792,585 financed laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology or biophysics, while $93,828 helped graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history and philosophy. The CSC lobbies aggressively to policymakers for wider acceptance of [[intelligent design]] and against the theory of [[evolution]] and what it terms "scientific materialism." To that end the CSC works to advance a policy it terms the [[Wedge strategy|Wedge Strategy]], of which the "[[Teach the Controversy]]" campaign is a major component. The "[[Teach the Controversy]]" strategy was announced by Meyer in [[2002]] [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Meyer.cfm]. It seeks to portray evolution as a "theory in crisis"<ref>Calling evolution "a theory in crisis," more than two-dozen scientists signed an amicus brief by written by Seth L.

===Biologic Institute===
In 2005 the Discovery Institute provided the funding to set up the Biologic Institute in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]], [[Washington]] working with Douglas Axe, author of a number of pro-intelligent design articles. The Biologic Institute conducts research into [[intelligent design]] in response to one of the primary criticisms of intelligent design, that there is no  valid research conducted by the scientific community on the topic. According to Axe, the lab's main objective "is to show that the design perspective can lead to better science", and will "contribute substantially to the scientific case for intelligent design".<ref name="god_lab">[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19225824.000-intelligent-design-the-god-lab.html Intelligent design: The God Lab] Celeste Biever.

Previously serving as a director of the institute was George Weber, who is also the head of the local chapter of the creationist group ''Reasons To Believe''. In an interview he stated that the lab is a wing of the Discovery Institute and that their goal is to "challenge the scientific community on naturalism" and "What we are doing is necessary to move ID along" which lead to his dismisal from the board of the institute.<ref name="god_lab"/><ref>[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/the_dis_genuine_imitation_leat.php The DI's Genuine Imitation Leather Research Lab] Ed Brayton.

==Discovery Institute Programs==
The Discovery Institute through the [[Center for Science and Culture]] has been advancing the agenda set forth in its mission statements in both the political and social spheres. That agenda includes the [[intelligent design movement]]; transportation in the [[United States|American]] and [[Canadian]] northwest ([[Pacific Northwest|Cascadia]]); a bioethics program opposed to [[assisted suicide]], [[euthanasia]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], human genetic manipulation, [[human cloning]], and the [[animal rights movement]]. Its economics and legal programs advocate [[tort]] reform, lower [[taxation]], and reduced economic regulation of individuals and groups as the best economic policy.  The Discovery Institute also maintains a foreign policy program currently focused on Russia and East Asia.

The Institute's primary thrust in terms of funding and resources dedicated are those political and cultural campaigns centering around intelligent design. These include the:
*[[Wedge strategy]]
*[[Intelligent design movement]]
*[[Teach the Controversy]]

===Intelligent design and Teach the Controversy===
The Discovery Institute's main thrust has been to promote intelligent design politically to the public, education officials and public policymakers, and to portray [[evolution]] as a "theory in crisis" and advocating teachers to "Teach the Controversy" through the [[Center for Science and Culture|CSC]]. It has employed a number of specific political strategies and tactics in the furtherance of its goals. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with ID proponents. The Discovery Institute has been a significant player in many of these cases, through the CSC providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards.

Some of the political battles which have involved the Discovery Institute include:
* [[Kansas evolution hearings]]
* [[Santorum Amendment]]
* [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] - the [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] intelligent design controversy

In 2004 the institute opened an office in [[Washington D.C]] and in 2005 the Discovery Institute hired [[Creative Response Concepts]],<ref>[http://www.crc4pr.com/firm/clients.asp Creative Response Concepts, clients]</ref>  the same [[public relations]] firm to promote its intelligent design campaign that promoted the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] campaign, the [[Republican National Committee]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], and the [[Contract With America]]. Creative Response Concepts scored an early victory for the institute in getting the New York Times to publish an essay by Roman Catholic Cardinal Sch<U+00F6>nborn, archbishop of Vienna, condemning evolution, against church teaching and the long-standing Catholic idea that God and evolution are compatible. The essay, ''Finding Design in Nature,''<ref>[http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/catholic/schonborn-NYTimes.html Finding Design in Nature] Cardinal Christoph Sch<U+00F6>nborn. The New York Times, July 7 2005.</ref> submitted directly to The Times by Creative Response Concepts, was prompted by the institute's Mark Ryland.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/09/science/09cardinal.html?ex=1278561600&en=0c183426986e5e77&ei=5089&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss Leading Cardinal Redefines Church's View on Evolution] Cornelia Dean, Laurie Goodstein.

===Cascadia===
Discovery Institute's Cascadia project<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/cascadia/ Discovery Institute's Cascadia project]</ref> focuses on regional transportation. The Cascadia Project started in 1992 with Bruce Agnew, former Chief of Staff for U.S. Representative [[John Miller (politician)|John Miller]], serving as the director. In 2003, Thomas Till was brought in as Managing Director, after leaving his post as Executive Director of the Amtrak Reform Council.<ref> [http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/arc/ A Message from the Amtrak Reform Council]</ref>

===Technology & Democracy===
The Technology and Democracy Project (TDP), has been a part of the Discovery Institute since the beginning; founded by Senior Fellow George Gilder.  The project supports technology as a force for economic growth and advocates freeing technological advancement from government regulation.  It utilizes national publications, speeches, conferences and public testimony to lobby for pro-technology and pro-free enterprise policies.   The Technology and Democracy Project supports pushing deregulation to the forefront of the national debate and maintains  a blog, disco-tech.org, <ref>[http://www.disco-tech.org disco-tech.org]</ref> where senior fellows comment on a wide range of issues.

===The Real Russia Project===
The [[Real Russia Project]] provides analysis and commentary on the future of democracy in Russia through its internet portal, 'RussiaBlog.'<ref>[http://www.russiablog.org RussiaBlog.org]</ref>  In addition to maintaining the weblog, the program organizes conferences and events to address current events and daily public life in Russia (i.e. the killing of [[Anna Politkovskaya]], U.S.-Russian business relations).<ref> [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=247&program=Russia%20Project&isEvent=true    How Do Western Stereotypes Harm U.S.-Russia Relations?] Discovery Institute Events, October 11 2006</ref>

===C.S. Lewis & Public Life===
The C.S. Lewis & Public Life program<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/cslewis/ The Discovery Institute's C.S. Lewis & Public Life program]</ref> is part of the Discovery Institute's Religion, Liberty & Public Life program<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/religion/ The Discovery Institute's Religion, Liberty & Public Life program]</ref> which seeks to define and promote the role of religion in society. It says what "the proper role of religion is in a free society" is the "animating question behind Discovery's program on religion and civic life." 

The C.S. Lewis & Public Life program provides analysis and commentary on the writings and thinking of [[C.S. Lewis]], a noted Christian [[apologetics|apologist]], and how they can influence public policy. Included in the program is <cite>The Lewis Legacy Online</cite>,<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/cslewis/legacy/ The Discovery Institute's <cite>The Lewis Legacy Online</cite>]</ref> a quarterly journal edited by Kathryn Lindskoog and the online archive, ''C.S. Lewis Writings in the Public Domain'',<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/cslewis/articles/writingspblcdmn/ The Discovery Institute's  C.S. Lewis Writings in the Public Domain]</ref> which includes the full text of ''Spirits in Bondage'', letters from Lewis, his will, a list of the ten books that influenced him most, and more.

==Controversy==
Although it often describes itself as a secular organization,<ref>"Discovery Institute is a secular think tank, and its Board members and Fellows represent a variety of religious traditions" [http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php Is Discovery Institute a religious organization?] Center for Science and Culture</ref><ref name="abc">[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1297170&WNT=true Small Group Wields Major Influence in Intelligent Design Debate] ABC News, November 9 2005</ref> critics, members of the press and former institute fellows consider the Discovery Institute to be an explicitly conservative Christian organization,<ref name="trojan horse">"Although it purports to be a secular organization, its religious moorings are clearly recognizable. Patricia O'Connell Killen, a religion professor at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma whose work centers around the regional religious identity of the Pacific Northwest, recently wrote that "religiously inspired think tanks such as the conservative evangelical Discovery Institute" are part of the "religious landscape" of that area."

One church and state watchdog organization stated, "Though the Discovery Institute describes itself as a think tank 'specializing in national and international affairs,' the group's real purpose is to undercut church-state separation and turn public schools into religious indoctrination centers."<ref>[http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5582&abbr=cs_ The Discovery Institute] Steve Benen. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, May 2002.</ref>

As evidence of the institute's organized campaign to mask or downplay its religious origins and agenda, critics point to the Discovery Institute's renaming of its ''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture'' to ''Center for Science and Culture'' in 2002 to avoid religious overtones implied with trying to "renew" society. They claim the name change "followed hard on the heels of accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians".<ref>[http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/2005/05jf/05jfforr.htm Wedging Creationism into the Academy, Proponents of a controversial theory struggle to gain purchase within academia.

Nina Shapiro in the Seattle Weekly article, <cite>The New Creationists</cite>, cites Bruce Chapman when she wrote that behind all Discovery Institute programs there is an underlying hidden religious agenda: 
{{quotation|"Yet the Discovery Institute as an organization didn't get involved in the issue in order to solve the mysteries of the universe. Chapman is up front about having a social and political agenda. He sees design intelligence as a way to combat the growing reliance on genetic explanations for human behavior and what he sees as an undermining of personal responsibility. As an example of this phenomenon, Chapman cites the infamous 'Twinkie defense' used by a murder defendant claiming his sugar high made him do it. Others associated with the institute take a bigger leap of logic to argue that welfare, as currently dispensed, is a misguided consequence of the Darwinian outlook. 'If you see human beings as nothing but matter and motion, than all you do is treat them like mouths to feed,' says Jay Richards, program director for the institutes Center for Science and Culture. 'If they're more than that, you treat the whole person,' he argues, which would mean looking at such things as family structure and the role of moral and religious values in their lives. Do you really have to attack a whole branch of science in order to counter liberal views on welfare? The Discovery Institute folk think they do. 'Unless you get the science right,' Chapman says, 'it's very hard to contend with the other arguments.'

The evolution of Discovery Institute President Bruce Chapman and Senior Fellow George Gilder from liberal Republicans criticizing their party for alienating intellectuals in the 1960s to running a conservative think tank whose main thrust has been to seek the undermining of evolution through campaigns like [[Teach the Controversy]] has prompted [[Chris Mooney]] to write in his book ''[[The Republican War on Science]]'': "You see, despite the poignant accuracy of their critique, the authors of The Party That Lost Its Head<U+2014>Bruce K. Chapman and George Gilder<U+2014>have since bitten their tongues and morphed from liberal Republicans into staunch conservatives. In fact, you could say that they have become everything they once criticized. Once opponents of right-wing anti-intellectualism, they are now prominent supporters of conservative attacks on the theory of evolution, not just a bedrock of modern science but one of the greatest intellectual achievements of human history."<ref name="mooney_chpt_11">[http://www.waronscience.com/excerpt.php The Republican War on Science] Chris Mooney.

At the foundation of most criticism of the Discovery Institute is the charge that the institute and its Center for Science and Culture intentionally misrepresent or omit many important facts in promoting their agenda. [[Intellectual dishonesty]], in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence, form the foundation of most of the criticisms of the institute.<ref>"ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance."

Its critics, such as [[Eugenie Scott]], [[Robert Pennock]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Barbara Forrest]], claim that the Discovery Institute knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through [[ellipsis]], and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials, and are often said to claim support from scientists when no such support exists.<ref>"The proponents of Intelligent Design (and creationism) are notorious for claiming support from scientists when no such support exists."

This criticism is not limited to those in the scientific community that oppose the teaching of intelligent design and the suppression of evolution, but also includes former Discovery Institute donors.  The [[Bullitt Foundation]], which gave $10,000 in 2001 for transportation causes, withdrew all funding of the institute; its director, Denis Hayes, called the institute "the institutional love child of Ayn Rand and Jerry Falwell," and said, "I can think of no circumstances in which the Bullitt Foundation would fund anything at Discovery today."<ref>[http://rightweb.irc-online.org/rw/501 The Glue that Binds the Movement]

The [[Templeton Foundation]], who provided grants for conferences and courses to debate intelligent design, later asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research, "They never came in," said Charles L. Harper Jr., senior vice president at the Templeton Foundation, who said that while he was skeptical from the beginning, other foundation officials were initially intrigued and later grew disillusioned. "From the point of view of [[rigour|rigor]] and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review," he said.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04good.html Ideas & Trends; Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker] Laurie Goodstein. New York Times, December 4 2005</ref>

The Templeton Foundation has since rejected the Discovery Institute's entreaties for more funding, Harper states. "They're political - that for us is problematic," and that while Discovery has "always claimed to be focused on the science," "what I see is much more focused on public policy, on public persuasion, on educational advocacy and so forth." <ref name="wilgoren" /> <ref>[http://www.templeton.org/topics_in_the_news/Statement_Anti_Evolutionism.pdf Anti-Evolutionism] John Templeton Foundation. (PDF file)</ref>

The [[Wedge strategy|Wedge document]], a widely circulated 1998 internal memo laid out Discovery's original, ambitious plan to "drive a wedge" into the heart of "scienti<U+FB01>c materialism," "thereby divorcing science from its purely observational and naturalistic methodology and reversing the deleterious effects of evolution on Western culture."  The two governing goals of the Wedge document are:

*To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies
*To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God  

Meyer says that the Wedge document "was stolen from our offices and placed on the Web without permission."<ref>[http://www.prospect.org/print/V13/22/mooney-c.html Survival of the Slickest: How anti-evolutionists are mutating their message] By Chris Mooney, The American Prospect, 16 December 2002</ref> The central item of this agenda - establishing intelligent design as legitimate science through conducting actual scienti<U+FB01>c research - has  not been achieved.<ref>[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science]] Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (2005)</ref>

Michelle Goldberg has said "... the Center for Science and Culture takes creationism and tries to legitimize it in scientific terms, and make it sound as if it<U+2019>s really just a kind of competing scientific theory. It hires people with a lot of impressive degrees, although, in many cases, they got the degrees specifically with the idea of using them to discredit Darwinism for religious reasons. It<U+2019>ll put someone forward like Jonathan Wells, who has a Ph.D. from Berkeley, and yet here he is, defending intelligent design. So they<U+2019>ve given a lot of thought to packaging intelligent design to make it seem like legitimate science. And they<U+2019>ve given a lot of thought to how to try to infiltrate their ideas into the culture."<ref>[http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/06/06/int06020.html  Michelle Goldberg's Gone To the MegaChurch and She Found Christian Nationalism There] Mark Karlin.

Several Discovery Institute fellows have left the institute over its positions and campaigns. Former senior fellow, Philip Gold, resigned his post as a defense analyst with the institute in 2002, says the institute had grown increasingly religious. "It evolved from a policy institute that had a religious focus to an organization whose primary mission is Christian conservatism."<ref name="wilgoren" />  One controversy erupted when it was made public in the online journal Salon that, in the summer of 2000, Discovery Institute President Chapman advised a breakaway faction of Episcopalians opposed to the ordination of gays on how to fund their desired [[schism (religion)|schism]] from the mainline denomination and suggested that funds from multi-millionaire and institute board member Howard Ahmanson, who was also a fellow Episcopalian, might be available for this task. In a memo Chapman sent to fellow dissident Episcopalians he stated that for their campaign to succeed fund-raising was critical, but "is going to be affected greatly by whether we have a clear, compelling forward strategy" and  "the Ahmansons are only going to be available to us if we have such a strategy and I think it would be wise to involve them directly in settling on it. . . .

==="Study" criticizing Judge Jones===
Controversy was stirred up again in December 2006 by the Discovery Institute and its fellows publishing several articles describing a "study" performed by the Discovery Institute criticizing the judge in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial. It claims that "90.9% of [[John E. Jones III|Judge Jones]]<U+2019> [opinion] on intelligent design as science was taken virtually verbatim from the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]<U+2019>s proposed 'Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law' submitted to Judge Jones nearly a month before his ruling."<ref>[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=1186 A Comparison of Judge Jones<U+2019> Opinion in Kitzmiller v. Dover with Plaintiffs' "Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law"] (pdf) John G. West and David K. DeWolf. Discovery Institute, December 12 2006.</ref> The study, though making no specific allegations of wrongdoing, implies that Judge Jones relied upon the plaintiff's submissions in writting his own conclusions of law.

Within a day, the president of the York County Bar Association had pointed out that parties are required by the courts to submit findings of fact and "a judge can adopt some, all or none of the proposed findings." She added that in the final ruling, a judge's decision "is the judge's findings and it doesn't matter who submitted them". A partner in a York law firm said that "Any attempt to make a stink out of it is absurd."<ref>[http://www.ydr.com/newsfull/ci_4830900 Judges' wording often borrowed], Rick Lee, The York Daily Record, December 12 2006.</ref>

Several commentators pointed out that Jones' use of the plaintiff's submissions were limited to his opinion, not his conclusion of law, and that "Vice President for Legal Affairs John West is not a lawyer, so he may not be familiar with the fact that this is exactly what proposed findings of fact are for. They are proposed findings which a judge, if he or she agrees, then incorporates as his or her own findings. ... The press release suggests that Judge Jones did something improper in adopting the plaintiffs<U+2019> proposed findings as his own<U+2014>but that is just what a judge does when he finds that the party has proven its case."<ref name="sandefur_behes">[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/12/weekend_at_behe.html Weekend At Behe<U+2019>s] Timothy Sandefur. The Panda's Thumb, December 12 2006.</ref> Others noted that the institute's reliance on [[Microsoft Word|MS Word]]'s "Word Count" function to conduct their study was flawed and resulted in inflated numbers, and that the bulk of the document Discovery studied was written by the law firm of [[Pepper Hamilton LLP]], not the ALCU.<ref name="brayton_fisking">[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2006/12/fisking_the_dis_study_on_the_d.php Fisking the DI's "Study" on the Dover Ruling] Ed Brayton. Dispatches from the Culture Wars, December 13 2006.</ref> Witold Walczak, legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the ACLU's lead attorney on the case called the Institute's report a stunt: "They're getting no traction in the scientific world so they're trying to do something ... as a PR stunt to get attention, ... That's not how scientists work, ... Discovery Institute is trying to litigate a year-old case in the media." He also said the Discovery Institute staff is not, as it claims, interested in finding scientific truths; it is more interested in a "cultural war," pushing for intelligent design and publicly criticizing a judge.<ref>[http://www.yorkdispatch.com/local/ci_4825206 New criticism for Dover intelligent design ruling] Christina Kauffman. The York Dispatch, December 12 2006.</ref> A subsequent study performed by [[Wesley Elsberry]], author of a text comparison program approved for use and considered authoritative in Federal court, on the section of the plaintiffs proposed findings of fact regarding whether ID is science with the section of the ruling on the same subject indicated that Judge Jones actually only incorporated 35% of the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the plaintiffs proposed that he incorporate, not the 90.9% the Discovery Institute claimed.<ref>[http://vangogh.fdisk.net/~welsberr/kvd/ Text Comparison source documents, Kitzmiller v.

==Funding==
The institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions and the dues of Institute members. Contributions made to it are tax deductible, as provided by law.

The institute does not provide details about its backers, out of "harassment" fears according to Chapman.<ref name="wilgoren" /> A review of tax documents on www.guidestar.org,<ref>[http://www.guidestar.org GuideStar.org]</ref> a Web site that collects data on foundations, showed grants and gifts totaling $4.1 million in 2003, the most recent year available. This is in contrast to $1.4 million in 1997, the oldest year available. The records show financial support from 22 foundations, at least two-thirds of which state explicitly religious missions. The Discovery Institute's CSC director, Stephen C. Meyer, admits much of the institute's money comes from such wealthy [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] conservatives as [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr|Howard Ahmanson Jr.]], who once said his goal is "the total integration of biblical law into our lives," [[Philip F. Anschutz]], [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], and the MacLellan Foundation, which commits itself to "the infallibility of the Scripture."<ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens] Peter Slevin. Washington Post, March 14 2005</ref> Ahmanson, who now sits on the Discovery Institute board, had pledged in 2001 $2.8 million to the institute through 2003.<ref>[http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=147 Discovery Institute emerging as force in creation, public policy] Karen L. Willoughby. Baptist2Bapist, May 15 2001.</ref> Most Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush campaign]].<ref name="salon_ahmanson"/><ref name="wilgoren" /> <ref name="nerve"/> The Discovery Institute denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of [[Stephen C. Meyer]] when ABC News' asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying "I don't think we want to go down that path."<ref name="abc"/>

Though in the minority, funding also comes from non-conservative sources:  The [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] gave $1 million in 2000 and pledged $9.35 million over 10 years in 2003, including $50,000 of [[Bruce Chapman|Bruce Chapman's]] $141,000 annual salary. The money of the Gates Foundation grant is "exclusive to the Cascadia project" on regional transportation, according to a Gates Foundation grant maker.<ref name="wilgoren" /> 

Published reports state that the institute has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since the CSC's founding in 1996.<ref name="wilgoren" />  "I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess," says [[William A. Dembski]], who, during the three years after completing graduate school in 1996 could not secure a university position, received what he calls "a standard academic salary" of $40,000 a year through the institute.
