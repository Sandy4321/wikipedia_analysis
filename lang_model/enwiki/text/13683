'''''Tory v. Cochran''''', [[Case citation|544 U.S. 734]] ([[2005]]), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving libel. The case began in [[California]] with [[Johnnie Cochran]], the famed attorney who represented [[O.J. Simpson]], suing his former client Ulysses Tory for [[libel]] and [[invasion of privacy]]. Cochran had withdrawn as Tory<U+2019>s lawyer in a civil rights suit nearly twenty years earlier, and in the late 1990s Tory began picketing Cochran<U+2019>s office, carrying signs that accused him of being a thief and of accepting bribes. A trial judge ruled that Tory had made false and defamatory statements about Cochran, and instead of awarding him [[damages]], issued an [[injunction]] ordering Tory to never again display a sign or speak about Cochran. Tory appealed, arguing that the [[Court order|order]] was a [[prior restraint]] that violated his [[First Amendment]] right to [[free speech]]. In an unpublished opinion, the California [[Court of Appeals]] ruled that the order was constitutional. The [[California Supreme Court]] declined to review the case, and on [[April 24]], [[2004]], Tory filed a [[petition]] for a [[writ of certiorari]] with the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was granted, briefing followed and the [[oral argument]] took place on [[March 22]], [[2005]]. Cochran died seven days later and the court asked for further briefing.

On [[May 31]], [[2005]], the court ruled 7-2 that in light of Cochran's death, the injunction limiting the demonstrations of Ulysses Tory "amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech."  Two justices with typically conservative views, [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]], said that Cochran's death made it [[mootness|unnecessary for the court to rule]].
