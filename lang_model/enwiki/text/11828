== Etymology ==
{{Jerusalem}}
{{further|[[Names of Jerusalem]]}}

The Semitic root of the name was sometimes thought to be "s-l-m" {{Fact|Feb 2009|date=February 2009}} meaning peace, harmony or completeness. A city called ''Ru<U+0161>alimum'' or'' Uru<U+0161>alimum''  appears in ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] records as one of the first reference to Jerusalem.<ref> G.Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren (eds.) ''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament'', (tr.David E.Green) William B.Eerdmann, Grand Rapids Michigan, Cambridge, UK 1990, Vol. VI, p.348</ref> These Egyptian forms are thought to derive from the local name attested in the Amarna letters, eg in EA 287 (where it takes several forms) ''Urusalim''.<ref>EA287 ''Abdi Hiba of Jerusalem to the king, No. 3'' [http://www.specialtyinterests.net/eae.html#287]</ref><ref>''The El Amarna Letters from Canaan'' [http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/EA263-end.html]</ref>
The form ''Yerushalayim'' (Jerusalem) first appears in the book of Joshua. This form has the appearance of a [[portmanteau]] of ''yerusha'' (heritage) and the original name ''Shalem'' and is not a simple phonetic evolution of the form in the Amarna letters.Some believe there is a connection to ''[[Shalim]]'', the beneficent deity known from [[Ugarit]]ic myths as the personification of dusk.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jerusalem  |last=Elon |first=Amos |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/telavivandjerusalem.htm |isbn=0006375316 |date=1996-01-08 |accessdate=2007-04-26 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd |quote=The epithet may have originated in the ancient name of Jerusalem<U+2014>Salem (after the pagan deity of the city), which is etymologically connected in the Semitic languages with the words for peace (shalom in Hebrew, salam in Arabic).}}</ref> Typically the ending ''-im'' indicates the plural in Hebrew grammar and ''-ayim'' the dual thus leading to the suggestion that the name refers to the fact that the city sits on two hills.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0405102984 |last=Wallace |first=Edwin Sherman |title=Jerusalem the Holy |month=August |year=1977 |page=16 |quote=A similar view was held by those who give the Hebrew dual to the word |accessdate=2007-04-25|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Jerusalem: The Topography, Economics and History from the Earliest Times to A.D. 70 |last=Smith |first=George Adam |year=1907 |accessdate=2007-04-25 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |page=251 |quote=The termination -aim or -ayim used to be taken as the ordinary termination of the dual of nouns, and was explained as signifying the upper and lower cities}} (see here [http://books.google.com/books?id=Nf4QAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA251&dq=jerusalem+name+dual&ie=ISO-8859-1])</ref> However the pronunciation of the last syllable as ''-ayim'' appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared at the time of the [[Septuagint]]. The Greeks added the prefix hiero ("holy") and called it ''Hierosolyma.'' To the Arabs, Jerusalem is ''al-Quds'' ("The Holy"). "Zion" initially referred to part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole. Under King David, it was known as ''Ir David'' (the City of David).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/jer.html |title=Jerusalem |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Jews in Jerusalem 1895.jpg|thumb|Jews of Jerusalem, 1895]]
In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], who generally remained in control until 1917.<ref name="century1" /> Jerusalem enjoyed a period of renewal and peace under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] - including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].<ref>Amnon Cohen. "Economic Life in Ottoman Jerusalem"; Cambridge University Press, 1989</ref> However, the Muslim Turks brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates; the use of the wheel for modes of transportation; stagecoach and carriage, the wheelbarrow and the cart; and the oil-lantern, among the first signs of modernization in the city.<ref name="multiref1">[http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm The Jerusalem Mosaic], Hebrew University, 2002</ref> In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.<ref name="multiref1"/>

With the annexation of Jerusalem by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city.

In biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of [[almond]], [[olive]] and [[pine]] trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.<ref name="jlmgeography">{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/jer.html

=== Climate ===
The city is characterized by a [[Mediterranean climate]], with hot, dry summers, and cool, rainy winters. Light snow usually falls once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years on the average. January is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 8 <U+00B0>C (46 <U+00B0>F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 23 <U+00B0>C (73 <U+00B0>F). Temperatures vary widely from day to night, and Jerusalem evenings are typically cool even in summer. The average annual precipitation is close to 590 millimetres (23 in) with rain occurring mostly between October and May.<ref name="weather">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/ISXX0010?from=month_bottomnav_business |publisher=The Weather Channel |accessdate=2007-02-07 |title=Monthly Averages for Jerusalem, Israel}}</ref>

{{Population of Jerusalem}}
{{main|Demographics of Jerusalem}}
In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600<U+2014>64% were [[Jew]]ish, 32% [[Muslim]], and 2% [[Christian]].<ref name="mfa-40th"/> At the end of 2005, the [[population density]] was {{Pop density km2 to mi2|5750.4|spell=American}}.<ref name="cbs" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st02_14.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |title=Population and Density per km<U+00B2> in Localities Numbering Above 5,000 Residents on 31 XII 2005 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-04-11}}</ref> According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Palestinian [[birth rate]], and Jewish residents leaving.  The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast.jerusalem.reut/index.html "Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem"] Reuters, September 26, 2000</ref>

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the [[United States]], [[France]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.<ref name="cbs" /> Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high [[birth rate]], especially in the Arab and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.<ref name="cbs" />

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%) <U+2014> similar to Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is  42%.<ref name="cbs" /> This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3254277,00.html |publisher=YNet |title=Jerusalem: More tourists, fewer Jews |date=2006-05-23 |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=Sel |first=Neta}}</ref> Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city.

In 2009, the percentage of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] in the city is strongly increasing. As of 2009, out of 150,100 schoolchildren, 59,900 or 40% are in state-run secular and [[Religious Zionist Judaism|National Religious]] schools, while 90,200 or 60% are in Haredi schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/165421|title=Most Jerusalemites Attend Hareidi-Religious Schools|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]|date=2009-05-21|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1086819.html|title=Most of Jerusalem's non-Jewish children live below poverty line|author=Nadav Shragai|publisher=Haaretz|date=2009-05-21|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>

While many Israelis see Jerusalem as poor, rundown and riddled with religious and political tension, the city has been a magnet for Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]]. Palestinian officials have encouraged Arabs over the years to stay in the city to maintain their claim.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-orthodox5jun05,1,1841144.story?page=2&coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Clashing values alter a city's face|author=Richard Boudreaux|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/weekinreview/13myre.html?_r=2&oref=slogin|title=Israeli Riddle: Love Jerusalem, Hate Living There|author=Greg Myre|publisher=New York Times|date=May 13, 2007}}</ref> Palestinians are attracted to the access to [[jobs]], [[healthcare]], [[social security]], other benefits, and [[quality of life]] Israel provides to Jerusalem residents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5137437.story?coll=la-util-nationworld-world|title=Change cast in concrete|author=Ken Ellingwood|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 4, 2007}}</ref> Arab residents of Jerusalem who choose not to have Israeli citizenship are granted an Israeli identity card that allows them to pass through checkpoints with relative ease and to travel throughout Israel, making it easier to find work.

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.<ref name="laub2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200463_pf.html |title=Jerusalem Barrier Causes Major Upheaval |date=2006-12-02 |publisher=The Associated Press via The Washington Post |last=Laub |first=Karin |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

==== Criticism of urban planning ====
Critics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Israel say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.<ref>Allison Hodgkins, "The Judaization of Jerusalem - Israeli Policies Since 1967"; PASSIA publication No. 96, December 1996, (English, Pp. 88)</ref> According to a [[World Bank]] report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Palestinians in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and "the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators" than Jewish violators of the permit process.<ref name = "worldbank"/> In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the [[City of David]] archaeological park in the Palestinian neighborhood of [[Silwan]] (adjacent to the Old City),<ref>Meron Rapoport.[http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&contrassID=1 Land lords]; Haaretz, January 20, 2005</ref> and the [[Museum of Tolerance]] on [[Mamilla]] cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).<ref>Esther Zandberg.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html "The architectural conspiracy of silence"]; Haaretz, Februrary 24, 2007</ref> The Israeli government has also expropriated Palestinian land for the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]].<ref name="worldbank">[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf "Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency"]; World Bank Technical Team, May 9, 2007</ref> Opponents view such urban planning moves as geared towards the [[Judaization]] of Jerusalem.<ref>Allison Hodgkins.

== Local government ==
[[File:KikarsafraS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Safra Square]], Jerusalem City Hall]]

The Jerusalem [[city council|City Council]] is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints six deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, [[Uri Lupolianski]], was elected in 2003.<ref name="corridors">{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1173879092720&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=2007-03-28 |date=2007-03-15 |title=Corridors of Power: A tale of two councils |last=Cidor |first=Peggy}}</ref> In the November 2008 city elections, [[Nir Barkat]] came out as the winner and is now the mayor. Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was [[Teddy Kollek]], who spent twenty-eight years <U+2014> six consecutive terms <U+2014> in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.<ref name="corridors" /> Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jerusalem Becomes A Battleground Over Gay Rights Vs.

On December 5, 1949, the State of Israel's first [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's [[Capital (political)|capital]]<ref name="ben-gurion" /> and since then all branches of the [[Politics of Israel|Israeli government]] <U+2014> [[Politics of Israel#Legislative branch|legislative]], [[Politics of Israel#Judicial system|judicial]], and [[Politics of Israel#Recent Prime Ministers and governments|executive]] <U+2014> have resided there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4181.IH: |publisher=The Library of Congress |title=Jerusalem and Berlin Embassy Relocation Act of 1998 |date=1998-06-25 |accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> At the time of the proclamation, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and [[Jordan]] and thus only West Jerusalem was considered Israel's capital. Immediately after the 1967 Six-Day War, however, Israel annexed [[East Jerusalem]], making it a ''[[de facto]]'' part of the Israeli capital.

The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]], passed on August 20, 1980, declared that the Basic Law was "null and void and must be rescinded forthwith." Member states were advised to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city as a punitive measure. Most of the remaining countries with embassies in Jerusalem complied with the resolution by relocating them to [[Tel Aviv]], where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Currently there are no embassies located within the city limits of Jerusalem, although there are embassies in [[Mevaseret Zion]], on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and four consulates in the city itself.<ref name="foreign-embassies" /> In 1995, the United States Congress had planned to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with the passage of the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ45.104.pdf |format=PDF |title=Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=2007-02-15 |date=1995-11-08}}</ref> However, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

Jerusalem plays an important role in  [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].

Jerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE.
