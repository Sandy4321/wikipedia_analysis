The '''Javan Rhinoceros''' ('''Sunda Rhinoceros''' to be more precise) or '''Lesser One-horned Rhinoceros''' (''Rhinoceros sondaicus'') is a member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant [[rhinoceros]]es. It belongs to the same genus as the [[Indian Rhinoceros]], and has similar mosaicked skin which resembles armor, but at 3.1<U+2013>3.2&nbsp;m (10<U+2013>10.5&nbsp;feet) in length and 1.4<U+2013>1.7&nbsp;m (4.6<U+2013>5.8&nbsp;ft) in height, it is smaller than the Indian Rhinoceros, and is closer in size to the [[Black Rhinoceros]]. Its horn is usually less than 25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;inches), smaller than those of the other rhino species.

Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan Rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Indonesia, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is now [[critically endangered]], with only two known populations in the wild, and none in zoos. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on earth.<ref name=Dinerstein/>  A population of at least 40<U+2013>50 live in [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] on the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]] and a small population, estimated in 2007 to be no more than eight, survives in [[Cat Tien National Park]] in [[Vietnam]]. The decline of the Javan Rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], fetching as much as $30,000 per kilogram on the black market.<ref name=Dinerstein/>  Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the [[Vietnam War]], in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species's decline and hindered recovery.<ref name=Santiapillai>{{Cite journal | author = Santiapillai, C. | year = 1992 | title = Javan rhinoceros in Vietnam | journal = Pachyderm | volume = 15 | pages = 25<U+2013>27}}</ref>  The remaining range is only within two nationally protected areas, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease and loss of genetic diversity leading to [[inbreeding depression]].

The Javan Rhino can live approximately 30<U+2013>45&nbsp;years in the wild. It historically inhabited lowland [[rain forest]], wet grasslands and large floodplains. The Javan Rhino is mostly solitary, except for courtship and child-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no [[predator]]s in their range. The Javan Rhino usually avoids humans, but will attack when it feels threatened. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly due to their extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan Rhino is the least studied of all rhino species.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
[[Image:Rhinoceros sondaicus in London Zoo.jpg|thumb|left|Javan Rhino in the London Zoo from march 1874 until january 1885]] 
The first studies of the Javan Rhinoceros by [[naturalist]]s from outside of its region took place in 1787 when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls were sent to the renowned Dutch naturalist [[Petrus Camper]], who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his discovery that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan Rhinoceros was shot on the island of [[Sumatra]] by [[Alfred Duvaucel]] who sent the specimen to his stepfather [[Georges Cuvier]], a famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by [[Anselme Ga<U+00EB>tan Desmarest]] as ''Rhinoceros sondaicus''. It was the last species of rhinoceros to be identified.<ref name="Rookmaaker">{{Cite book | author = Rookmaaker, Kees | year = 2005 | chapter = First sightings of Asian rhinos | pages = 52 | editor = Fulconis, R. | title = Save the rhinos: EAZA Rhino Campaign 2005/6 | location = London | publisher = [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] }}</ref>  Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to say his specimen was from Java.<ref name=Zeitschrift>{{Cite journal | author = Rookmaaker, L.C. | year = 1982 | title = The type locality of the Javan Rhinoceros (''Rhinoceros sondaicus'' Desmarest, 1822) | journal = Zeitschrift fur Saugetierkunde | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 381<U+2013>382}}</ref>

The genus name ''Rhinoceros'', which also includes the Indian Rhinoceros, is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''rhino'' meaning ''nose'', and ''ceros'' meaning ''horn''; ''sondaicus'' is derived from ''[[sundaland|sunda]]'', the [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region that comprises islands of Sumatra, Java, [[Borneo]], and surrounding smaller islands. The Javan Rhino is also known as the Lesser One-Horned Rhinoceros (in contrast with the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros, another name for the Indian Rhino).

There are three distinct subspecies, of which only two are presumed to be extant:
* '''''Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus''''', the type subspecies, known as the '''Indonesian Javan Rhinoceros''', once lived on Java and Sumatra. The population is now confined to around 40<U+2013>50 animals in the [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] on the western tip of the island of [[Java]]. One researcher has suggested that the Javan Rhino on Sumatra belonged to a distinct subspecies, ''R.s. floweri'', but this is not widely accepted.<ref name="IUCN Rss">Asian Rhino Specialist Group (1996).

* '''''Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus''''', known as the '''Vietnamese Javan Rhinoceros''' or '''Vietnamese Rhinoceros''', once lived across Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and into [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]].  ''Annamiticus'' is derived from the [[Annamite Range|Annamite Mountain Range]] in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies's range. A single population, estimated at less than 12 remaining rhinos, lives in an area of lowland forest in the [[Cat Tien National Park]] in [[Vietnam]].

* '''''Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis''''', known as the '''Indian Javan Rhinoceros''', once ranged from [[Bengal]] to [[Burma]], but is presumed to have gone extinct in the first decade of the 1900s.  ''Inermis'' means ''unarmed'', as the most distinctive characteristic of this sub-species is the small horns in males, and evident lack of horns in females.   The original specimen of this species was a hornless female. The political situation in Burma has prevented assessment of the species in that country, but its survival is considered unlikely.<ref name=Foose>{{Cite book | last = Foose | first = Thomas J. | coauthors = Nico van Strien | year = 1997 | title = Asian Rhinos <U+2013> Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | publisher = IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK | isbn = 2-8317-0336-0}}</ref><ref name=Pachy>{{Cite journal | journal = Pachyderm | title = Records of the Sundarbans Rhinoceros (''Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis'') in India and Bangladesh | author = Rookmaaker, Kees | volume = 24 | year = 1997 | pages = 37<U+2013>45}}</ref><ref name="NE India"/>

=== Evolution ===
[[Image:Panzernashorn2004.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian Rhinoceros]] pictured here is closely related to the Javan Rhinoceros; they are the two members of the [[type genus]] ''Rhinoceros''.]]
{{Main|Rhinoceros#Evolution}}
Ancestral rhinoceroses first diverged from other [[Perissodactyl]]s in the [[Early Eocene]]. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests that the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of [[Equidae]] around 50 million years ago.<ref name=DNA/>  The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in [[Eurasia]], and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the [[Miocene]].<ref name=Lacombat>{{Cite book | author = Lacombat, Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric | year = 2005 | chapter = The evolution of the rhinoceros | pages = 46<U+2013>49 | editor = Fulconis, R. | title = Save the rhinos: EAZA Rhino Campaign 2005/6 | location = London | publisher = [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] }}</ref>

The Indian and Javan Rhinoceros, the only members of the genus ''[[Rhinoceros (genus)|Rhinoceros]]'', first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million<U+2013>3.3 million years ago.

== Description ==
[[Image:Java-1934.jpg|thumb|left|Head of a male ''Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus'' shot on 31 January 1934 at Sindangkerta in West Java]] 
The Javan Rhino is smaller than its cousin, the Indian Rhinoceros, and is close in size to the [[Black Rhinoceros]]. The body length of the Javan Rhino (including its head) can be up to 3.1<U+2013>3.2&nbsp;m (10<U+2013>10.5&nbsp;feet), and it can reach a height of 1.4<U+2013>1.7&nbsp;m (4.6<U+2013>5.8&nbsp;ft). Adults are variously reported to weigh between 900 and 2,300&nbsp;kg (2,000 and 5,100&nbsp;lb), although because they are endangered, a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has never been conducted and is not a priority.<ref name=Dinerstein/>  There is not a substantial size difference between genders, but females may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in Vietnam appear to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints.<ref name="van Strien">{{Cite book | author = van Strien, Nico | year = 2005 | chapter = Javan Rhinoceros | pages = 75<U+2013>79 | editor = Fulconis, R. | title = Save the rhinos: EAZA Rhino Campaign 2005/6 | location = London | publisher = [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] }}</ref>

Like its Indian cousin, the Javan Rhinoceros has a single horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than 20&nbsp;cm (7.9&nbsp;inches) with the longest recorded only 27&nbsp;cm (10<U+00BD>&nbsp;in). The Javan Rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting, but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (the Black, Sumatran and Indian Rhinoceroses), the Javan Rhino has long, pointed, upper lips which help in grabbing food. Its lower [[incisor]]s are long and sharp; when the Javan Rhino fights it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan Rhino smells and hears well but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.<ref name="van Strien"/>

Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin falls in folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck folds of the Javan Rhinoceros are smaller than those of the Indian Rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan Rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.<ref name=NatPost>{{Cite news | title = Their trail is warm: Scientists are studying elusive rhinos by analyzing their feces | work = [[National Post]] | author = Munro, Margaret | date = May 10, 2002 }}</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[Image:Ujungkulon.jpg|thumb|Java's [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] is the home of most remaining Javan rhinos.]]
Even the most optimistic estimate suggests there are fewer than 100 Javan Rhinos in the wild. They are considered possibly the most endangered of all large mammals; although there are more [[Sumatran rhino|Sumatran Rhinos]], their range is not as protected as that of the Javan Rhinos, and some conservationists consider them to be at greater risk. The Javan Rhinoceros is only known to survive in two places, the [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] on the western tip of Java and the [[Cat Tien National Park]] about 150&nbsp;km (90&nbsp;miles) north of [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref name=CG/><ref name=NYT/>

The animal was once widespread from [[Assam]] and [[Bengal]] (where their range would have overlapped with both the Sumatran and Indian Rhino<ref name="NE India"/>) eastward to [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and southwards to the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the islands of [[Sumatra]], [[Java]] and possibly [[Borneo]].<ref name=Raffles/>  The Javan Rhino primarily inhabits dense lowland rain forests, tall grass and reed beds that are plentiful with rivers, large floodplains, or wet areas with many mud wallows. Although it historically preferred low-lying areas, the subspecies in Vietnam has been pushed onto much higher ground (up to 2,000&nbsp;m or 6,561&nbsp;ft), probably because of human encroachment and poaching.<ref name=Foose/>

The range of the Javan Rhinoceros has been shrinking for at least 3,000 years. Starting around 1000&nbsp;BC, the northern range of the rhinoceros extended into China, but began moving southward at roughly 0.5&nbsp;km (0.3&nbsp;mile) per year, as human settlements increased in the region.<ref name=Biotropica/>  It likely became locally extinct in India in the first decade of the 20th century.<ref name="NE India">{{Cite journal | author = Rookmaaker, L.C. | year = 2002 | title = Historical records of the Javan rhinoceros in North-East India | journal = Newsletter of the Rhino Foundation of Nature in North-East India | issue = 4 | pages = 11<U+2013>12 | month = June}}</ref>  The Javan Rhino was hunted to extinction on the Malaysian peninsula by 1932.<ref name=Straits>{{ Cite news | work = [[New Straits Times]] | title = On the horns of a dilemma | author = Ismail, Faezah | date = June 9, 1998 }}</ref>  By the end of the [[Vietnam War]], the Vietnamese Rhinoceros was believed extinct across all of mainland Asia.

== Behavior ==
[[Image:JavanRhino-PeterMaas-NaturalisLeiden.jpg|thumb|A museum specimen of a juvenile ''Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus'']] 
The Javan Rhinoceros is a solitary animal with the exception of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They will sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain a cool body temperature and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan Rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Males's home ranges are larger at 12<U+2013>20&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (5<U+2013>8&nbsp;miles<U+00B2>) compared to the females's which are around 3<U+2013>14&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (1<U+2013>5&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>). Males's territories overlap each other less than those of females. It is not known if there are territorial fights.<ref name=IZY/>

Males mark their territory with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes made by the feet in the ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan Rhinoceros, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.<ref name=IZY>{{Cite journal | journal = International Zoo Yearbook | year = 2006 | volume = 40 | pages = 150<U+2013>173 | title = Rhinoceros behaviour: implications for captive management and conservation | author = Hutchins, M. | coauthors = M.D. Kreger | publisher = [[Zoological Society of London]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1090.2006.00150.x }}</ref>

The Javan Rhino is much less vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan Rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adult Javan Rhinos have no known predators other than humans. The species, particularly in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study.<ref name=Santiapillai/>  Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan Rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head.<ref name=IZY/>  Its comparatively anti-social behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests that, like other rhinos, the species was once more gregarious.<ref name=CG/>

== Diet  ==
The Javan Rhinoceros is herbivorous and eats diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Most of the plants favored by the species grow in sunny areas: in forest clearings, shrubland and other vegetation types with no large trees. The rhino knocks down saplings to reach its food and grabs it with its prehensile upper lip. It is the most adaptable feeder of all the rhino species. Currently it is a pure browser but probably once both browsed and grazed in its historical range. The rhino eats an estimated 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) of food daily. Like the Sumatran Rhino, it needs salt in its diet. The salt licks common in its historical range do not exist in Ujung Kulon, but the rhinos there have been observed drinking seawater, likely for the same nutritional need.<ref name=IZY/>

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Dead_Javan_Rhino.jpg|thumb|A Dutch hunter with a dead ''Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus'' in 1895]] 
{{See also|Rhinoceros#Rhinoceros horns}}
The main factor in the continued decline of the Javan Rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity in China for over 2,000 years where they are believed to have healing properties in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Historically, its hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide can be used to make an antidote for snake venom.<ref name=AP2/>  Because the rhinoceros's range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money.<ref name=Biotropica>{{Cite journal | journal = Biotropica | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 202<U+2013>303 | year = 2007 | title = The Impact of Hunting on the Mammalian Fauna of Tropical Asian Forests | author = Corlett, Richard T. | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00271.x }}</ref>  When the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] first went into effect in 1975, the Javan Rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection: all international trade in the Javan Rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal.<ref name=African>{{Cite book | last = Emslie | first = R. | coauthors = M.

[[Image:Javan Rhino Zimmerman.jpg|thumb|left|A painting from 1861 depicts the hunting of ''Rhinoceros sondaicus sondaicus'']]
Loss of habitat because of agriculture has also contributed to its decline, though this is no longer as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in two nationally protected parks. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. Even with all the conservation efforts, the prospects for the Javan Rhinoceros's survival are grim. Because the populations are restricted to two small areas, they are very susceptible to disease and the problems of inbreeding. Conservation geneticists estimate that a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve the genetic diversity of this [[conservation reliant species]].<ref name=NYT>{{Cite news | title = Racing to Know the Rarest of Rhinos, Before It<U+2019>s Too Late | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11rhin.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | date = July 11, 2006 | author = [[Mark Derr|Derr, Mark]] }}</ref>

=== Ujung Kulon ===
The [[Ujung Kulon National Park|Ujung Kulon]] peninsula was devastated by the eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 1883.

By 1980 that population had doubled, and has remained steady at about 50 ever since.

=== Cat Tien ===
[[Image:Raffles-Museum.jpg|thumb|Head of a male ''Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus'' shot in Perak on the Malay Peninsula]] 
The few remaining members of ''R.s. annamiticus'' live in the [[Cat Tien National Park]] in Vietnam. Once widespread in Southeast Asia, after the [[Vietnam War]], the Javan Rhinoceros was presumed extinct. The tactics used in the combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region: use of [[napalm]], extensive defoliation from [[Agent Orange]], aerial bombing and use of landmines. The war also flooded the area with inexpensive weapons. After the war, many poor villagers, who previously relied on methods like pit traps, now had deadly weapons at their disposal, enabling them to become efficient poachers. The assumption of the subspecies extinction was challenged when, in 1988, a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh rhinoceros tracks belonging to at least 15 rhinos were found along the [[Dong Nai River]].<ref name=AP1>{{Cite news | title = World's Rarest Rhinos Found In War-Ravaged Region of Vietnam | author = Raeburn, Paul | date = April 24, 1989 | work = [[Associated Press]] }}</ref>  Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited became part of the Cat Tien National Park in 1992.<ref name=AP2>{{Cite news | title = Scientists Find Surviving Members of Rhino Species | author = Stanley, Bruce | date = June 22, 1993 | work = [[Associated Press]]}}</ref>

Their population is feared to have declined past the point of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating that as few as 3<U+2013>8 rhinos, and possibly no males, survive.<ref name=NYT/><ref name=BBCpop/>  Conservationists debate whether or not the Vietnamese Rhinoceros has any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.<ref name=Santiapillai/><ref name=WWF>{{Cite web | url = http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/rhinoceros/asian_rhinos/javan_rhinoceros/index.cfm | title = Javan Rhinoceros; Rare, mysterious, and highly threatened | date = March 28, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | work = [[World Wildlife Fund]]}}</ref>

In early May 2010, the body of one of the last Javan rhinos in Vietnam was found in Cat Tien. The animal had been shot and its horn removed by poachers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?193168/Rare-Javan-rhino-found-dead-in-Vietnam |title=Rare Javan rhino found dead in Vietnam}} WWF, 10 May 2010</ref>

=== In captivity ===
[[Image:Jamrach-1877.jpg|thumb|Female of the extinct ''Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis'', imported by the animal dealer Jamarch from the Sunderbunds (or Sundarbans) in India. It was in London in 1877 where it lived less than 6 months]] 
A Javan Rhinoceros has not been exhibited in zoos in a century. In the 1800s, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta and London. A total of at least 22 Javan Rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity, and it is possible that the number is greater as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian Rhinoceros.<ref name = Garten>{{Cite journal | author = Rookmaaker, L.C. | year = 2005 | title = A Javan rhinoceros, ''Rhinoceros sondaicus'', in Bali in 1839 | journal = Zoologische Garten | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 129<U+2013>131}}</ref>  The Javan Rhinoceros never fared well in captivity: the oldest lived to be 20, about half the age the rhinos will reach in the wild. The last captive Javan Rhino died at the [[Adelaide Zoo]] in [[Australia]] in 1907 where the species was so little known that it had been exhibited as an Indian Rhinoceros.<ref name="van Strien"/>  Because a lengthy and expensive program in the 1980s and 1990s to breed the Sumatran Rhinoceros in zoos failed badly, attempts to preserve the Javan species in zoos are unlikely.<ref name=Dinerstein>{{Cite book | title = The Return of the Unicorns; The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros | last = Dinerstein | first = Eric | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | location = [[New York]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-231-08450-1 }}</ref>
