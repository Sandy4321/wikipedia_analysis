'''''Banksia sphaerocarpa''''', commonly known as the '''Fox Banksia''' or '''Round-fruit Banksia''',  is a species of [[shrub]] or tree in the plant genus ''[[Banksia]]'' (family [[Proteaceae]]). It is generally encountered as a 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;m (3<U+2013>7&nbsp;ft) high shrub, and is usually smaller in the north of its range. This species has narrow green leaves, and brownish, orange or yellow round flower [[raceme|spikes]] which may be seen from January to July. It is widely distributed across the [[Southwest Botanical Province|southwest]] of [[Western Australia]], growing exclusively in sandy soils. It is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. It is pollinated by, and is a food source for, birds, mammals, and insects.

First described in 1810 by botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]], ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' has a complicated [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] history, and several [[Taxon|taxa]] once classified as part of a broadly defined ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' have since been named as species in their own right. At present, most authorities recognise five [[Variety (botany)|varieties]]; the largest variety, [[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''dolichostyla'']] (Ironcap Banksia), is sometimes given species rank as ''B.&nbsp;dolichostyla''. ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' is classified as Not Threatened under the [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950|Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia]], although two varieties  have been placed on the [[Declared Rare and Priority Flora List]]<U+2014>var. ''latifolia '' has been declared a Priority Two <U+2013> Poorly Known taxon, and var. ''dolichostyla'' has been Declared Rare Flora. None of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation.

==Description==
''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' is a variable species that differs in plant size, flower size and leaf size across its range. The variability is marked enough that five [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] are recognised. This species is generally a shrub 0.4<U+2013>2&nbsp;m (1<U+2013>7&nbsp;ft) tall. Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range, and grow larger in the southeast, with var. ''dolichostyla'' and rarely var. ''caesia'' reaching 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) in height. All varieties bear a [[lignotuber]], a swollen starchy [[root crown]] from which the plant resprouts after [[bushfire]]. The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity. The leaves are stiff, narrow and linear, and measure 2.5<U+2013>10&nbsp;cm (1<U+2013>4&nbsp;in) in length, on a petiole 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;mm (0.1&nbsp;in) long. Leaves of most varieties are 1<U+2013>1.5&nbsp;mm in width, and have a pointed tip,<ref name="George 1999"/> but var. ''latifolia'' has wider leaves, 2<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>1&nbsp;in), and a blunter tip.<ref name="George 2008">{{cite journal | last = George | first = Alex | date = 2008 | title = Further new taxa in ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae: Grevilleoideae) | journal = Nuytsia | volume = 18 | pages = 53<U+2013>59 | issn = 0085<U+2013>4417}}</ref> The foliage is green, or a more pale blue-grey in the case of ''caesia'' and ''dolichostyla''.

''dolichostyla'', are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour.<ref name="George 1999"/> They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. Anthesis takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence.  Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.<ref name="Markey 1996">{{cite conference | first = Adrienne S. | last = Markey | coauthors = Lamont, Byron B. | year = 1996 | title = Why do some banksias have green nectar? | booktitle = International Symposium on the Biology of Proteaceae | location = Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne}}</ref> The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike. Up to 60&nbsp;[[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring 1.5<U+2013>3&nbsp;cm (0.6<U+2013>1.2&nbsp;in) long, 0.5<U+2013>0.8&nbsp;cm (0.2<U+2013>0.3&nbsp;in) high, and 1<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>1&nbsp;in) wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section.<ref name="George 1999"/> Specimens of var. ''sphaerocarpa'' in the [[Whicher Range]], [[Jarrah Forest]] and the vicinity of [[Nannup, Western Australia|Nannup]] have larger follicles.<ref name="George 2008"/> The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure 2.0<U+2013>2.6&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>1&nbsp;in) in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring 1<U+2013>1.4&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.6&nbsp;in) long by 0.5<U+2013>1.3&nbsp;cm (0.2<U+2013>0.5&nbsp;in) wide.<ref name="George 1999"/>

Northern specimens can be quite small shrubs and may be hard to distinguish from ''[[Banksia micrantha|B.&nbsp;micrantha]]'', which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles.<ref name="George 1999"/>

The earliest known botanical collection of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' occurred in December 1801, during the visit of [[HMS Investigator|HMS ''Investigator'']] to [[King George Sound]]. The specimen was collected from "A single plant observed between [[Princess Royal Harbour]] & [[Oyster Harbour]] on a heath",<ref name="FloraBase Brown">{{cite web | url = http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/brown/search?brname=Banksia+sphaerocarpa | title = Banksia sphaerocarpa | work = Robert Brown's Australian Botanical Specimens, 1801<U+2013>1805 at the BM | publisher = Western Australian Herbarium, Department of Environment and Conservation, Government of Western Australia | accessdate = 2010-01-12}}</ref> and is credited to English botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]], though it is not possible to be certain on this point, as Brown incorporated the collections of junior expedition members into his herbarium without attribution.

In [[Brown's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Brown's arrangement of the genus]], ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' was placed between ''[[Banksia pulchella|B.&nbsp;pulchella]]'' and ''[[Banksia nutans|B.&nbsp;nutans]]'' in [[taxonomic sequence]]; that is, an order that places related taxa next to each other. No subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a [[subgenus]] of its own.<ref name="Brown 1810"/> Swiss botanist [[Carl Meissner]] published [[Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|a more detailed arrangement]] in 1856, placing ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' in [[Section (botany)|section]] [[Banksia sect. Eubanksia|''Eubanksia'']] because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed [[Head (botany)|head]], and in [[Series (botany)|series]] [[Banksia ser. Abietinae|''Abietinae'']], whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations.<ref name="Meissner 1856">{{cite encyclopedia | author = Meissner, Carl | year = 1856 | chapter = Proteaceae | editor = [[A.

[[George Bentham]]'s [[Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|revision of ''Banksia'']] for his 1870 ''[[Flora Australiensis]]'' overturned Meissner's series; instead, ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' was placed in a new section, ''[[Banksia sect. Oncostylis|Oncostylis]]'', because of its hooked [[pistil|styles]]. Two varieties were recognised: Meissner's var. ''glabrescens'' was retained, and var. ''latifolia'' was newly described by Bentham. Bentham noted further variation amongst his specimens not accounted for by his varieties, stating "It is possible therefore that two species may be here confounded, but the specimens are insufficient for their distinction."<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia | author = Bentham, George | year = 1870 | title = Banksia | encyclopedia = Flora Australiensis | volume = 5 | pages = 541<U+2013>62 | location = London | publisher = L. Reeve & Co.}}</ref>

For many years following Bentham's arrangement, the circumscription of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' was widely recognised as unacceptably broad. [[William Blackall]] informally published two varieties, var. ''pinifolia'' and var. ''violacea'' (properly ''[[Banksia violacea]]'') in his 1954 ''[[How to Know Western Australian Wildflowers]]'';<ref name="Blackall 1954">{{cite book | first = William | last = Blackall | year = 1954 | title = How to know Western Australian wildflowers | location = Nedlands | publisher = University of Western Australia Press | page = 130}}</ref> and in 1966 the nurseryman [[Fred Lullfitz]] predicted that there were as many as eight taxa within the species.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991">{{cite book | last = Wrigley | first = John |coauthors = Fagg, Murray | title = Banksias, Waratahs and Grevilleas | year = 1991 | publisher = Angus & Robertson | location = Sydney | isbn = 0-207-17277-3|page = 116}}</ref> Several of these were recognised in George's revision of the genus for 1981 "[[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)|The genus ''Banksia'' L.f. (Proteaceae)]]": ''[[Banksia micrantha|B. micrantha]]'', ''[[Banksia grossa|B. grossa]]'', ''[[Banksia lanata|B. lanata]]'', ''[[Banksia scabrella|B. scabrella]]'', ''[[Banksia telmatiaea|B. telmatiaea]]'', ''[[Banksia leptophylla|B. leptophylla]]''<ref>''Banksia leptophylla'' had been classified informally as ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''pinifolia'' or var. ''major'' until 1981. When it was promoted to species rank, the binomial combination ''Banksia pinifolia'' could not be used because it has already been published for ''[[Hakea gibbosa]]''.</ref> and ''B.&nbsp;incana''.<ref name="George 1981"/><ref name="BSG6">{{cite journal | year = 1982 | author = Blake, T. | title = The ''Banksia'' revision | journal = Banksia Study Report | publisher = Banksia Study Group | location = Ringwood, Victoria | volume = 6 | pages = 1<U+2013>19 | issn = 0728-2893}}</ref> George placed ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' in subgenus [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because of its flower spike, section ''Oncostylis'' because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series ''Abietinae'', which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He reduced variety ''latifolia'' to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with variety ''sphaerocarpa'', but conceded the species needed further review.<ref name="George 1981"/> Alex George reported that he thought ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'''s closest relatives to be ''[[Banksia micrantha]]'' and ''[[Banksia grossa|B. grossa]]''.<ref name="George 1999">{{Cite encyclopedia | last = George | first = Alex | year = 1999 | title = Banksia | editor = Wilson, Annette | encyclopedia = Flora of Australia | volume = 17B | pages = 238<U+2013>39 | location = Collingwood, Victoria | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study | isbn = 0-643-06454-0}}</ref>

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges published an  [[Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|arrangement]] informed by a [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. ''Banksia'' ser. ''Abietinae'' was found to be very nearly [[monophyly|monophyletic]], and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four [[subseries]]. ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' ''grossa'' clade' for its most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member. As with George's classification, ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' and ''B.&nbsp;micrantha'' emerged as close relatives of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa''.

This clade became the basis for new subseries [[Banksia subser. Sphaerocarpae|''Sphaerocarpae'']], which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in ''micrantha''), and "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". Other than the most basal ''B.&nbsp;grossa'', these species also have shouldered follicles. Having found ''B.&nbsp;micrantha'' to be more closely related than ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''dolichostyla'' to the other varieties of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'', they promoted var. ''dolichostyla'' to species rank as ''Banksia dolichostyla''. Morphological support for this was given by the fact that the old styles of var. ''dolichostyla'' are quite different from those of other varieties, being stouter, and tending not to curl around the infructescence as the others do.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | last1 = Thiele | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Ladiges | first2 = Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A cladistic analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> 

Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of ''Banksia'' for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' series of monographs. He added that he did not feel the characters of ''dolichostyla'' alone justified specific rank, beings essentially merely larger in all parts than, but otherwise essentially similar to, var. ''caesia''. Therefore he retained it as a variety of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa''. To date, George's 1999 arrangement remains the most recent comprehensive classification.

===Varieties===
[[File:Banksia sphaerocarpa caesia Bendering.jpg|thumb|var. ''caesia'', Bendering Reserve |alt=Closeup of spherical golden yellow bloom made up of hundreds of individual flowers]]
''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' is a widely distributed Western Australian species with four (or five if one includes var. ''dolichostyla'') varieties:
*[[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. caesia|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''caesia'']], first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus, grows larger than most other varieties, reaching 2&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft), or occasionally 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft), in height. It has yellow blooms and bluish grey foliage and is found in the central and southern [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] between the towns of [[Piawaning, Western Australia|Piawaning]], [[Kojonup, Western Australia|Kojonup]], [[Newdegate, Western Australia|Newdegate]] and [[Corrigin, Western Australia|Corrigin]].<ref name="George 1999"/>

*[[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''dolichostyla'']] (Ironcap Banksia) was first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus. It is the largest of the varieties, encountered as a large shrub or small tree to 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) high. It is larger in all parts than the other varieties, and has been considered a separate species. It is restricted to a small area from South Ironcap, east of Hyden, south to Mt Holland in the eastern Wheatbelt.<ref name="George 1999"/>

*[[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. latifolia|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''latifolia'']] was originally described in a manuscript by Mueller and published by Bentham in 1870. It grows as a small rounded shrub to 50&nbsp;cm (1.5&nbsp;ft) in height, and is restricted to the vicinity of the south coast between [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]] and the [[Porongurup National Park|Porongorup Range]], where it is found in low, open forest of ''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus calophylla|E. calophylla]]''.<ref name="George 2008"/>

*[[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. sphaerocarpa|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''sphaerocarpa'']] is widely distributed from the [[Darling Plateau]] east of Perth to the [[Whicher Range]] in the southwest, and southeast to the [[Stirling Range]]. Populations north of Perth once referable to it are now classified as var. ''pumilio''.<ref name="George 2008"/>

*[[Banksia sphaerocarpa var. pumilio|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''pumilio'']], first described by Alex George in 2008, is a small shrub less than a metre high. It is found from [[Tathra National Park]] east of Eneabba south to the Chittering valley.

''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' is distributed widely across southwestern Western Australia<U+2014>from [[Eneabba, Western Australia|Eneabba]] in the north, south to the [[Whicher Range]], Nannup, [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] and [[Jerramungup, Western Australia|Jerramungup]], and eastwards to the vicinity of [[Hyden, Western Australia|Hyden]]. It is mainly found on sandy soils in flat or gently sloped areas in [[shrubland]], [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] or open woodland.<ref name="Taylor 1988">{{cite book | last1 = Taylor | first1 = Anne | last2 = Hopper | first2 = Stephen | year = 1988 | title = [[The Banksia Atlas]] (Australian Flora and Fauna Series Number 8) | location = Canberra | publisher = Australian Government Publishing Service | isbn = 0-644-07124-9 | pages = 218<U+2013>19}}</ref>

==Conservation==
As a species, ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' is not considered to be under threat,<ref name="FloraBase 1851">{{FloraBase | name = ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' R.Br.   | id = 1851}}</ref> but two of the five varieties, have been placed on the [[Declared Rare and Priority Flora List]]. ''B&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''dolichostyla'' has been gazetted as "Declared Rare Flora <U+2013> Extant" under the [[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950]].<ref name="FloraBase 11582">{{FloraBase | name = ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' var.

==Ecology==
{{seealso|Ecology of Banksia}}
Various animals, including mammals, birds, and insects such as bees, wasps, ants and beetles, have been recorded visiting ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' inflorescences, including the [[colletidae|colletid]] bee species ''[[Hylaeus sanguinipictus]]''.<ref name="Museum Victoria">{{cite web | url = http://flyaqis.museum.vic.gov.au/cgi-bin/texhtml?form=bio_bee.sum&qrytaxonomy=Hylaeus+sanguinipictus&qrylocation=&qryplant=Banksia+sphaerocarpa | title = ''Hylaeus sanguinipictus'' on ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' | work = Museum Victoria website | publisher = Museum Victoria Australia | accessdate = 11 January 2010}}</ref> Botanist [[Stephen Hopper]] found pollen of ''B. sphaerocarpa'' on [[New Holland Honeyeater]]s (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'') and [[Honey Possum]]s (''Tarsipes rostratus'')  at Cheyne Beach in a [[field study]] published in 1980.<ref name="Hopper 1980">{{cite journal | last = Hopper | first = Stephen D. | date = 1980 | title = Bird and Mammal pollen vectors in ''Banksia'' communities at Cheyne Beach, Western Australia | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 28 | pages=61<U+2013>75 | doi=10.1071/BT9800061}}</ref>

Knowledge of the [[breeding system]] of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' comes from a 2009 study of [[genetic structure]] within and across [[habitat fragmentation|fragmented]] plant populations, which made a [[case study]] of ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' var. ''caesia'' populations in the vicinity of [[Dongolocking, Western Australia|Dongolocking]], where the landscape has been severely fragmented by [[land clearing]]. Very little [[self-pollination]] was observed. Most mating was between plants in the same population, but inter-population mating accounted for 15<U+2013>33% of seed, a "very significant contribution... to overall reproductive dynamics". This figure was lowest in the smallest populations, which also exhibited lower rates of germination, smaller plants, and less genetic diversity than larger populations. One possible interpretation of this is that interpopulation mating confers a fitness advantage. There was also evidence of fine-scale genetic structure, with plants tending to be more closely related to nearby plants than to more distant plants. The authors suggest that gene flow was probably always limited in these populations, even before they were fragmented.<ref name="Young 2009">{{cite paper | author = Young, Andrew; Broadhurst, Linda; Byrne, Margaret; Coates, David; Yates, Colin | year = 2009 | title = Molecular ecological analysis of vegetation function in fragmented Australian biomes | version = CPI13 final report | publisher = Land & Water Australia, Australian Government | url = http://lwa.gov.au/products/pn30213 | accessdate = 2010-02-18}}</ref>

''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' is one of five closely related ''Banksia'' species that have highly unusual flower [[nectar]]. Whereas other ''Banksia'' species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming "an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers".<ref name="Lamont 1980">{{cite journal | author = Lamont, Byron B. | year = 1980 | title = Blue-green algae in nectar of ''Banksia'' aff. ''Sphaerocarpa'' | journal = West Australian Naturalist | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 193<U+2013>94}}</ref> It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he attributed it to [[cyanobacteria]] that feed off the nectar [[sugar]]s. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had [[heterocyst]]s, he speculated that they aid the plant by [[nitrogen fixation|fixing atmospheric nitrogen]], which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the [[Cluster root|proteoid]] root mat. This purported [[symbiosis]] was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found.<ref name="Barrett 1985">{{cite journal | author = Barrett, Gregory J.; Lamont, Byron B. | year = 1985 | title = Absence of nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) by procaryotes in nectar of Banksias | journal = Plant and Soil | volume = 85 | pages = 443<U+2013>45 | doi = 10.1007/BF02220200}}</ref> Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather "a chemical phenomenon of plant origin". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free [[amino acid]]s,<ref name="Markey 1996"/> but three of these species, including ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'', have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions.<ref name="Nicolson 1998">{{cite journal | author = Nicolson, Susan W.; Van Wyk, Ben-Erik | year = 1998 | title = Nectar sugars in Proteaceae: Patterns and processes | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 46 | pages = 489<U+2013>504 | doi = 10.1071/BT97039}}</ref>

Like most Western Australian ''Banksia'' species, ''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'' is susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]''.<ref name="DEH 2006">{{cite web | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/appendix4.pdf |format=PDF| title = Part 2, Appendix 4: The responses of native Australian plant species to Phytophthora cinnamomi | work = [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/p-cinnamomi.html Management of Phytophthora cinnamomi for Biodiversity Conservation in Australia] | publisher = [[Department of the Environment and Heritage]], Australian Government | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2009-04-22}}</ref> In one experiment, 43% of plants were dead within three months of inoculation, and the species was therefore rated as "moderately susceptible".<ref name="Cho 1983">{{cite journal | author = Cho, J.

==Cultivation==
None of the varieties of ''Banksia sphaerocarpa'' are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult to grow in the wetter conditions of Australia's east coast.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> Trials with [[grafting]] have been very limited and results have been poor.<ref name="MacKenzie 1986">{{cite journal | last = MacKenzie | first = Doug | title = Grafted Banksias | year = 1986 | journal = Banksia Study Group Report | issue = 7 | pages = 2<U+2013>9 | issn = 0728-2893}}</ref> Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant.<ref name="Eliot 1985"/> They are good bird-attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> Seeds do not require any treatment prior to [[sowing]], and take 20 to 48 days to [[germinate]].<ref name="Sweedman 2006">{{cite book | author = Sweedman, Luke; Merritt, David | year = 2006 | title = Australian seeds: a guide to their collection, identification and biology | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | isbn = 0643092986 | page = 203}}</ref>
