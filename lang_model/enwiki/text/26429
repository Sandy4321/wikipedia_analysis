Iput was a sister and wife of [[Pepi II]]. <ref> Dodson A. and Hilton D., The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt</ref> She was buried close to [[Pepi II]] at Saqqara and her tomb contains a version of the pyramid Texts.

Her titles include: Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t), She who sees Horus and Seth (m33t-hrw-stsh), King<U+2019>s Wife (hmt-nisw), King<U+2019>s Wife, his beloved (hmt-nisw meryt.f), Beloved King<U+2019>s Wife of Neferkare-Men-ankh (hmt-nisw meryt.f-nfr-k3-r<U+2019>-mn-<U+2018>nkh), Beloved King<U+2019>s Wife of Neferkare-Men-ankh-Neferkare (hmt-nisw meryt.f-nfr-k3-r<U+2019>-mn-<U+2018>nkh-nfr-k3-r<U+2019>), King<U+2019>s Daughter (s3t-niswt), Eldest King<U+2019>s Daughter (s3t-niswt-smswt) <ref> Grajetzki, W. , Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary </ref>

Iput's pyramid complex consisted of a pyramid and a small mortuary temple. The temple was built in an L-shape. In one of the storerooms of the mortuary temple excavators discovered the granite sarcophagus of Queen [[Ankhesenpepi IV]], another wife of [[Pepi II]]. It is not entirely clear if Ankhesenpepi IV was originally buried in the burial complex of Iput II, or if she was originally interred elsewhere and reburied during the first intermediate period.
The text inscribed on the sarcophagus has been very hard to decipher, but the text that has been desciphered gives an overview of the history of the early part of the 6th dynasty. From the text it is now clear that Userkare reigned some 4 years, but damnatio memoriae later lead to his name being expunged from the records. <ref> Verner, M., The Pyramids: The Mystery, Culture and Science of Egypt's great Monuments </ref>
