A '''coronation''' is a ceremony marking the investiture of a [[monarch]] or their consort with regal power, specifically involving the placement of a [[coronation crown|crown]] upon his or her head, and the presentation of other items of [[regalia]].  This rite may also include the taking of a special vow, acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects, and/or performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to a given nation.  Coronations were once a vital ritual in many of the world's monarchies, but this changed over time due to a variety of socio-political and religious factors. While most monarchies have dispensed with formal coronation rites, preferring simpler [[enthronement]], [[investiture]], or [[benediction]] rites, coronations are still held in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Tonga]] and several [[Asia]]n countries. 

In common usage, "coronation" often simply refers to the official investiture or [[enthronement]] of the monarch, whether an actual crown is bestowed or not.

In addition to the investing of the monarch with a diadem and other symbols of state, coronations often involve [[anointing]] with [[holy oil]], or [[chrism]] as it is often called.  Wherever a ruler is anointed in this way, as in Great Britain and Tonga, this [[ritual]] takes on an overtly religious significance, following examples found in the [[Bible]].  Some other lands use bathing or cleansing rites, the drinking of a sacred beverage, or other religious practices to achieve a comparable effect. Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country.

In the past, concepts of royalty, coronation and deity were often inexorably linked.  In some ancient cultures, rulers were considered to be divine or partially divine: the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Pharaoh]] was believed to be the son of [[Ra]], the sun god, while in [[Japan]] the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] was believed to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]], the sun goddess.  [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] promulgated the practice of [[emperor worship]]; in [[Medieval Europe]], monarchs claimed to have a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] to rule.  Coronations were once a direct visual expression of these alleged connections, but recent centuries have seen the lessening of such beliefs due to increasing [[secularization]] and [[democratization]]. Thus coronations (or their religious elements, at least) have often been discarded altogether, or altered to reflect the constitutional nature of the states in which they are held.  However, some monarchies still choose to retain an overtly religious dimension to their accession rituals. Others have adopted simpler "[[enthronement]] or "inauguration" ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all.

==History and development==
Coronations, in one form or another, have existed since ancient times.  Egyptian records show coronation scenes, such as that of [[Seti I]] in 1290 B.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aurorahistoryboutique.com/ahb.cfm?a=S000116|title=Coronation scene of Seti I&nbsp;<U+2014> Painted Relief, Temple of Abidos, Egypt. 19th. Dynasty 1317 B.C.:|publisher=aurorahistoryboutique.com|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> while the Judeo-Christian [[Old Testament|scriptures]] testify to particular rites associated with the conferring of kingship, the most detailed accounts of which are found in [[II Kings]] 11:12 and [[II Chronicles]] 23:11.  These Biblical accounts influenced later European ceremonies, together with those of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tonga]], following the conversion of those lands to [[Christianity]].<ref name="britannica1">{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Coronation|title=Coronation|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref>  In non-Christian states, coronation rituals evolved from a variety of sources, often related to the religious beliefs of that particular nation.  [[Buddhism]], for instance, influenced the coronation rituals of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Bhutan]], while [[Hindu]] elements played a significant role in [[Nepal]]ese rites.  The ceremonies used in modern [[Egypt]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Iran]] were shaped by [[Islam]], while Tonga's ritual combines ancient Polynesian influences with more modern [[Anglican]] ones.  However it is the European coronation ceremonies, most specifically that used in Great Britain (the last of which occurred in 1953), that are perhaps best-known to most Westerners.  These descend from rites initially created in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Byzantium]], and brought to their apogee during the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] era.

[[File:Martorana RogerII.jpg|right|thumb|Detail of the [[mosaic]] with King [[Roger II of Sicily]] receiving the crown directly from [[Jesus Christ]], [[Martorana]], Palermo.]]

The European coronation ceremonies of the Middle Ages were essentially a combination of the Christian rite of [[anointing]] with additional elements.  In some European countries prior to the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a [[shield]], and while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a [[spear]], and a diadem, wrought of [[silk]] or [[linen]] (not to be confused with a [[crown (headgear)|crown]]) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.<ref name="britannica1"/>  Following Europe's conversion to Christianity, crowning ceremonies became more and more ornate, depending on the country in question, and their Christian elements<U+2014>especially anointing<U+2014>became the paramount concern.<ref name="britannica1"/><ref name="catholic2">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Coronation|last=Thurston|first=Herbert}}</ref>  Crowns and [[sceptre]]s, used in coronations since ancient times, took on a Christian significance together with the [[Globus cruciger|orb]] as symbols of the purported divine order of things, with the monarch as the divinely ordained overlord and protector of his dominion.   During the [[Middle Ages]], this rite was considered so vital in some European kingdoms that it was sometimes referred to as an "eighth [[sacrament]]".<ref name="catholic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cheetah.net/~ccoulomb/coronations.html|title=Coronations in Catholic theology|last=Coulombe|first=Charles A|date=2005-05-09|publisher=Charles.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], the idea of [[Divine Right of Kings|divinely-ordained]] monarchs began to be challenged.<ref>{{cite book |title=The English Reformation|last=Dickens|first=A.G.|year=1978|publisher=Fontana/Collins|location=London & Glasgow|page=399|isbn=0805201777|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFN-AAAACAAJ&dq=0805201777}}</ref><ref name="ponet1">{{cite book|last=Ponet|first=John|title=A Shorte Treatise of Politike Power|editor=Patrick S.

The [[Papacy]] retains the option of a coronation, though no pope has used it since 1963.<ref name="wister1">{{cite web|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~wisterro/cdi/paul_vi.htm|title=The Coronation of Pope Paul VI|last=Wister|first=Fr.

==Monarchical power==
In most kingdoms, a monarch succeeding hereditarily does not have to undergo a coronation to ascend the throne or exercise the prerogatives of their office. King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], for example, did not reign long enough to be crowned before he [[abdicate]]d, yet he was unquestionably the King of the United Kingdom and [[Emperor of India]] during his brief [[reign]]. This is because in Britain, the law stipulates that the moment one monarch dies, the new one assumes the throne; thus, there is no point at which the throne is vacant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4945.asp |title=Accession |work=Ceremony and Symbol |author=Royal Household |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> In France, the new king ascended the throne when the coffin of the previous monarch descended into the vault at [[Saint Denis Basilica]], and the [[Duke]] of [[Uzes]] proclaimed "[[The King is dead.

The last heir apparent to the French throne to be crowned during his father's lifetime was the future [[Philip II of France]], while the only crowned heir apparent to the English throne was [[Henry the Young King]], who was first crowned alone and then with his wife, [[Margaret of France (1158<U+2013>1197)|Margaret of France]]. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an heir apparent was the coronation of the future Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] as junior King of Hungary in 1830.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite book

==In antiquity==
===Ancient Egypt===
[[Pharaoh]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] were believed to be directly descended from the [[gods]].  These deities were believed to confer special powers upon the ruler, all of which were essential to maintaining earthly and cosmic order.  Thus, a Pharaoh's coronation was not merely a rite to proclaim him as king or to legitimize his political right to rule; it literally facilitated the transmission of these unearthly powers to the new Egyptian ruler.  In this ceremony, the king was transformed into a god by means of his union with the royal ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'', or lifeforce of the soul. All previous kings of Egypt had possessed this royal ''ka'', and at his or her coronation, the monarch became divine as "one with the royal ''ka'' when his human form was overtaken by his immortal element, which flows through his whole being and dwells in it".<ref name="touregypt1">{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/royalcults.htm|title=The Royal Cults of the Kings of Ancient Egypt|last=Monet|first=Jefferson|publisher=www.touregypt.net|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  This made him the son of [[Ra]], the sun god, [[Horus]], the falcon god, and [[Osiris]], the god of life, death and fertility.  From the [[Middle Kingdom]] on, the Pharaoh also came to be seen as the son of [[Amun]], the king of Egyptian gods, until his cult faded in later centuries.  At his death, the king became fully divine, according to Egyptian belief, being assimilated with Osiris and Ra.<ref name="touregypt1" />

Upon the death of the reigning Pharaoh, his successor was named immediately, so that the nation's cosmic protection would continue unbroken.  While the new monarch ascended the throne the very next day, the coronation ceremony did not take place until the first day of a new season, thus symbolising the beginning of a new era. The ceremony was usually carried out at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] by the high priest, who invested the new king with the necessary powers to continue his predecessors' work.<ref name="pharoah1">{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyonline.com/pharaoh's_divine_power.htm|title=Pharaoh's Divine Power|last=High|first=Tony|publisher=Egyptology Online|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

As a permanent reminder to his people of his divine birthright, the Pharaoh wore various elements of royal regalia that varied depending upon the particular period in Egyptian history.  Among these were a false beard made from [[goat|goat's]] hair, identifying him with the god [[Osiris]];  a sceptre shaped like a [[shepherd]]'s crook known as a ''[[Heka]]'', which meant "ruler" and was often associated with [[magic (paranormal)|magic]];  and a fly whip called the ''Nekhakha'', symbol of his power and authority.  The new monarch also wore a ''Shemset'' apron, while his back was protected by a [[cattle|bull]]'s tail hanging from his belt, symbolic of strength, though this was later done away with.<ref name="touregypt2">{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/reg.htm|title=Egypt: Ancient Egyptian Royal Regalia, A Feature Tour Egypt Story:|last=Parsons|first=Marie|publisher=Tour Egypt|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  He was invested with a crown during his coronation: depending upon the timeframe in question, the king might have been given the White Crown, or [[Hedjet]] (the crown of [[Upper Egypt]]), the [[Deshret]] or Red Crown (diadem of [[Lower Egypt]]), the [[Pschent]] or ''Sekhemti'' (the Double Crown, combining the White and the Red Crowns), the [[Nemes]] or striped headcloth, or the [[Khepresh]] or Blue Crown.<ref name="pharoah1" /><ref name="touregypt2" />  The ''Pschent'' was generally used for the highest state occasions,<ref name="pharoah1"/> and was conferred on all Pharaohs from at least the [[First Dynasty]] on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fage|first=John Donnelly|coauthors=Desmond J. Clark, Roland Anthony Oliver, A. D. Roberts|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1975|page=521|isbn=0521215927}}</ref>  When the Hedjet was combined with red [[Ostrich]] feathers of the Osiris cult, the resulting diadem was referred to as the [[Atef]] crown.

===Ancient Israel===
According to the [[Bible]], Kings in [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Israel]] were crowned and anointed, most often by (or at the behest of) a [[prophet]] or [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]].  In [[I Samuel]] 10:1, the prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints [[Saul]] to be Israel's first king; later, in I Samuel 16:13, he anoints [[David]] to replace him.  In [[II Samuel]] 12:30, David is crowned with the [[Ammon]]ite crown, after his conquest of [[Rabbah]], the Ammonite capital.  [[II Kings]] 9:1-6 tells of the anointing of [[Jehu]] as king of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]].  [[Book of Esther|Esther]] 2:17 relates the crowning of [[Esther]] as consort of [[Ahasuerus]], king of [[Persian Empire|Persia]].  Ahasuerus was once identified with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, though most scholars reject this connection today.<ref name="littman1">{{cite book|last=Littman|first=Robert J|title=The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the "Book of Esther"|publisher=The Jewish Quarterly Review|location=Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania|year=1975|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-6682%28197501%292%3A65%3A3%3C145%3ATRPOXA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  He has also been identified with [[Artaxerxes I]] and [[Artaxerxes II]].

A more detailed account of a coronation in ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] is found in II Kings 11:12 and [[II Chronicles]] 23:11, in which the seven-year-old [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]] is crowned in a [[coup]] against the usurper [[Athaliah]].  This ceremony took place in the doorway of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].  The king was led to "his pillar", "as the manner was", where a crown was placed upon his head, and "the testimony" given to him, followed by anointing at the hands of the high priest and his sons.  Afterwards, the people "clapped their hands" and shouted "God save the King" as trumpets blew, music played, and singers offered hymns of praise.  All of these elements would find their way in some form or another into future [[Europe]]an coronation rituals after the conversion of Europe to [[Christianity]] many centuries later, and all Christian coronation rites continue to borrow from these examples.

===Ancient Persia===
The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] and [[philosopher]] [[Plutarch]] wrote in his ''Life of King [[Artaxerxes I|Artaxerxes]]'' that the Persian king was required to go to the ancient capital of [[Pasargadae]] for his coronation ceremony.  Once there, he entered a temple "to a warlike [[goddess]], whom one might liken to [[Artemis]]" (whose name is unknown today, nor can this temple be located), and there divested himself of his own robe, substituting the one worn by [[Cyrus I]] at his crowning.  After this, he had to consume a "frail" of [[fig]]s, eat [[turpentine]] and drink a cup of sour [[milk]].  Plutarch observed that "if they add any other rites, it is unknown to any but those that are present at them".<ref name="plutarch1">{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/pan-paz/pasargadae/pasargadae_text.html#1|title=The Persian coronation ceremony at Pasargadae|first=[[Plutarch of Chaeronea]]|date=2008-09-06|work=Life of King Artaxerxes (translation)|publisher=Livius|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

===Imperial Rome and Byzantium===
[[Emperor of Rome|Roman emperors]] were traditionally acclaimed by the [[senate]] or by a [[Roman legion|legion]] speaking for the armies as a whole, and were subsequently confirmed without any special ritual. The Eastern diadem was later introduced by [[Aurelian]],<ref name="ellopos1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/vasilief/reforms-diocletian-constantine.asp|title=Ch. 1: "The Empire From Constantine to Justinian the Great", subsection "Reforms of Diocletian and Constantine|work=A History of the Byzantine Empire|publisher=Ellopos.net|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> but did not truly become part of the ''imperator's'' regalia until the reign of [[Constantine I|Constantine]].<ref name="catholic2"/>  Prior to this, Roman sovereigns wore the purple [[paludamentum]], and sometimes a [[laurel wreath]] as emblems of their office.<ref name="catholic2"/>

Following the assumption of the diadem by Constantine, future Roman and Byzantine emperors continued to wear it as the supreme symbol of their authority.  Although no specific coronation ceremony was observed at first, one gradually evolved over the next century.  The emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] was hoisted upon a shield and crowned with a gold necklace provided by one of his standard-bearers;<ref name="catholic2"/> he later wore a jewel-studded diadem.  Future emperors were crowned and acclaimed in a similar manner, until the momentous decision was taken to permit the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] to physically place the crown on the emperor's head.  Historians debate exactly when this first took place, but the precedent was clearly established by the reign of [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo II]], who was crowned by the Patriarch [[Acacius of Constantinople|Acacius]] in 473.  This ritual included recitation of prayers by the Byzantine prelate over the crown, a further<U+2014>and extremely vital<U+2014>development in the liturgical ''ordo'' of crowning.  After this event, according to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', "the ecclesiastical element in the coronation ceremonial rapidly develop[ed]".<ref name="catholic2"/>

The Byzantine coronation ritual, from at least 795 on, incorporated a partial clothing of the new emperor in various items of special clothing prior to his entrance to the church, following which he entered the cathedral and received the prostrations of the [[Byzantine Senate|Senator]]s and other [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s.  The Patriarch then read a set of lengthy prayers, as the sovereign was invested first with the [[chlamys]] and then finally with the crown.  Following this, the emperor received [[Holy Communion]] followed by further acts of homage.<ref name="catholic2"/><ref group="N">{{cite web|title=The Byzantine Coronation Ceremony, according to Emperor Constantine VII, Porphyrogennetos|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/kapparis/byzantium/Coronation_Ceremony.doc|author=Kapparis, Konstantinos|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=2008-09-13|format=PDFdoc}}</ref> From the moment of his coronation, Byzantine emperor was regarded as holy; while the Patriarch was holding the crown over the emperor's head, the attending people repeatedly cried: ''Holy!'' <ref name="Sedlar"/>

In later centuries, after receiving their crown from the Patriarch, Byzantine emperors placed it upon their own head, symbolizing that their dominion came directly from God.<ref name="wister2">{{cite web|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~wisterro/coronation.htm|title=The Legitimation of Authority Divine and Human|last=Wister|first=Fr.

The purple chalamys also disappeared from the rite during this time, being replaced with the ''[[mandyas]]'', or cope.<ref name="catholic2"/>

Two prayers for the coronation of Byzantine emperors are found in the Byzantine ''Archieratikon'' (Slavonic: ''Chinovnik'').  The second of these prayers is proceeded by the [[Deacon|diaconal]] command: "Bow your heads to the Lord" and the assembly<U+2019>s response: "To you, O Lord."  This pattern of two prayers corresponds to the ritual form found in the Byzantine [[liturgy]] for the ordinations of bishops, priests and deacons and also for major blessings, such as the Great Blessing of Waters on the Feast of the [[Theophany]].  In some texts, the first prayer is associated with the act of clothing the emperor in the chalamys and the second with the act of crowning him.[http://homepage.mac.com/paulstephenson/trans/decer0.html]  Although the Byzantine coronation ritual underwent various changes throughout the centuries, these two prayers are found consistently in every version.  They also occur in the Russian ritual for the crowning of the [[Tsar]], beginning with [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], and also in the ritual for the coronation of an [[emperor]] beginning with that of [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]].

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main|Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor}}
[[File:Karl den store krons av leo III.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Pope Leo III]].]]

[[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] were crowned by the pope or other Catholic bishops, until [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] became the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned at Bologna, in 1530.  Thereafter, until the abolition of the empire in 1806, no further crownings were held.<ref group="N">See also Guy Stair Sainty, [http://www.chivalricorders.org/nobility/holyroman/ The Holy Roman Empire: Introduction].  From the [http://www.chivalricorders.org/ Almanach de la Cour] website.  Retrieved on 14 September 2008.</ref>  Later rulers simply proclaimed themselves ''Electus Romanorum Imperator'' or "Elected Emperor of the Romans", without the formality of a coronation.

Coronations were held in [[Rome]] (under the pope), [[Milan]] (the Kingdom of Italy), [[Arles]] (Burgundy) and [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] (Germany).  Although the Roman ceremony was initially the most important, it was eventually eclipsed by the German ritual.  The custom of the emperors going to Rome to be crowned was last observed by Frederick III in 1440; after that only the German coronation was celebrated.<ref name="britannica1"/>

==In the modern era==
===Africa===
====Ashanti====
The [[Asantehene]], the ruler of the [[Ashanti]] of Ghana begins his reign by being raised and lowered over the [[Golden Stool]] (sika 'dwa), which is believed to embody the very soul of the Ashanti people, without touching it.  The Golden Stool is the most sacred ritual object in Ashanti culture and only the Asantehene is allowed to touch it.  

====Central African Empire====
The [[Central African Empire]] was a short-lived monarchical regime established in 1976 in what was then the [[Central African Republic]], by [[Jean-Bedel Bokassa]], the nation's president.  Inspired by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] coronation in 1804, "Bokassa I" staged his own elaborate ritual inside a large outdoor stadium in [[Bangui]], his capital, on 4 December 1977.  While guests sweltered in the 100-degree heat, the self-proclaimed emperor ascended a giant golden [[throne]] shaped like an [[eagle]] with outstretched wings, donned a 32-pound coronation robe containing 785,000 [[pearl]]s and 1,220,000 [[crystal]] beads, and then crowned himself with a gold crown topped by a 138-caret [[diamond]] that cost over $2,000,000 to manufacture.  His empress, Catherine<U+2014>the youngest of his three wives<U+2014>was then invested with a smaller diadem.  The total bill for Bokassa's regalia alone came to $5,000,000.<ref name="time1">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945849-1,00.html|title=Mounting a Golden Throne|date=1977-12-19|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref><ref group="N">Several photos of Bokassa's coronation may be seen at [http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f186/central-african-empire-emperor-bokassa-10054.html Central African Empire: Emperor Bokassa].

240 tons of food and drink were flown into Bangui for Bokassa's coronation banquet, including a tureen of [[caviar]] so large that two chefs had to carry it, and a seven-layer cake.  Sixty new [[Mercedes-Benz]] limousines were airlifted into the capital, at a hefty cost of $300,000 for airfreight alone.  All in all, the entire ceremony cost $20,000,000 to stage, an astronomical sum in a nation whose annual gross domestic product was only $250,000,000.  The newly-crowned Emperor used French aid grants to cover a significant portion of the bill, saying: "Everything here was financed by the French government. We ask the French for money, get it and waste it".<ref name="time1"/>

In 1979, Bokassa was overthrown in a coup, carried out with French military support, by the very man he himself had overthrown in 1965, [[David Dacko]].<ref name="time3">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916883,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|title=French Fiddling|date=1979-10-08|publisher=Time|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref> The monarchy was abolished, the emperor was exiled, and his empire reverted to its former name.

====Egypt====
The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] (1922-53) held an enthronement rite for its last ruling king, [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk I]].  A controversy arose as to whether the ritual should be religious in nature, an option favored by the king, or whether it should be purely secular, which was desired by Farouk's Prime Minister at the time, Mustafa El-Nahhas.  The religious ceremony envisaged the new king taking special vows in an Islamic ritual, followed by his receipt of the sword of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]].  However, El-Nahhas insisted upon Farouk simply taking a constitutional oath before parliament, followed by a formal reception at his palace.  The Prince Regent proposed combining the two ideas, but the government refused.<ref name="ahram1">{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/753/chrncls.htm|title=Crowning moment|date=2005-07-28|publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly|accessdate=2008-09-29}}</ref>

The ceremony, which took place on 29 July 1937, followed the Prime Minister's directives.  The [[Egyptian army]] swore loyalty to the new monarch, who then entered the Parliament chamber where he first greeted his mother, then listened to two speeches given by the Prime Minister and the speaker of the Upper House.<ref group="N">A photo of King Farouk taken during this ceremony can be seen at "[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/798/chrncls.htm What European papers said]"; ''Al Ahram Weekly'' Website</ref>  Following this, the king took his constitutional oath, and was acclaimed by the assembled legislators and guests.<ref name="ahram1" />

Farouk was overthrown in the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]].  His son, [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]], was deposed in 1953 while still an infant, and the monarchy abolished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+eg0042) |title=Egypt |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> Egypt is now a republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html |title=The World Factbook&nbsp;<U+2014> Egypt |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

====Ethiopia====
The [[Ethiopian Empire]] used a coronation ritual for its [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors]].  The last such event was held on 2 November 1930, for Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the final monarch of Ethiopia.

Heavily influenced by Ethiopia's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] tradition, preparation for the coronation ceremony commenced seven days prior to the actual event.  Following an ancient Ethiopian custom, forty-nine Coptic bishops and priests continually chanted from the [[Psalter]] in groups of seven, in seven corners of the Cathedral of St. George, in [[Addis Ababa]], where the crowning was to take place.  On the eve of the ceremony, the imperial robes and regalia were taken into the church to be blessed and prayed over by the Abuna, or Archbishop, followed by the new Emperor and his family, who arrived at midnight and remained inside the cathedral that night in prayer.<ref name="rastaites1" group="N">Background information on the coronation may be found at the ''rastaites.com'' website, [http://www.rastaites.com/HIM/coronation.html Coronation of HIM Haile Selassie I]. Retrieved on 24 August 2008.</ref>

The following morning, the Emperor was met inside the cathedral by the Archbishop, who presented him with a [[Gospel book]] and asked him to take a four-part coronation oath.  This oath required him to defend the Ethiopian Orthodox Faith, rule according to law and the interest of his subjects, safeguard the realm and establish schools for teaching of both secular and Orthodox religious subjects.  After this, the Abuna read a special prayer of blessing, while drums and harps accompanied the chanting of Psalm 48.  Various items of the Imperial Regalia were brought forward, blessed and presented to the new sovereign one-by-one.  These items included a golden sword, a scepter of ivory and gold, the orb, a diamond-encrusted ring, two traditional lances filigreed in gold, the imperial vestments, and finally the crown.  Each item was accompanied by an anointing with seven differently-scented oils.  After this, the new monarch and his consort were taken on a tour of the church, then escorted outside by a procession of notables carrying palm branches and chanting: "Blessed be the King of Israel".<ref name="rastaites1" group="N" />

Ethiopian tradition required the Emperor's consort to be crowned at the palace, three days after the coronation.  However, Haile Selassie broke with this precedent, and had his wife crowned (but not anointed) in the cathedral with him.  Selassie was overthrown by a military coup in 1974, and the monarchy was abolished in 1975.

====Lesotho====
The tiny African kingdom of [[Lesotho]] crowns its monarchs.  The last such ritual was held on 31 October 1997, when current king [[Letsie III]] was crowned in a sports stadium in the capital city of [[Maseru]].  King Letsie entered the stadium escorted by units of mounted police clad in red uniforms and carrying [[saber]]s and lances.  Donning a traditional coat of animal skins, the new ruler was crowned by two [[chieftain]]s with a beaded headband containing a brown and white [[feather]].  Traditional dances and songs followed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/31/lesotho.coronation/ |title=Lesotho's King Letsie III crowned again |publisher=Cnn.com |date=October 31, 1997 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

====Swaziland====
[[Swaziland]], a small independent kingdom in southern Africa, held a coronation ritual in April 1986 for its current monarch, [[Mswati III]].  Although Swazi tradition required the king to wait until his twenty-first year to be crowned, Mswati was crowned three years early due to disputes between different factions in the regency council.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761584087__1/Mswati_III.html |title=Mswati III |publisher=Encarta.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>  Swazi chiefs paid a tribute of 105 cattle to the family of Mswati's mother, Ntombi, as a dowry for the woman who was to become the new "Mother of the Nation".  The rite itself included various secret rituals, after which the new king took part in several ritual dances in full feathered regalia.  At the coronation, tribal singers repeated his imposing chain of official titles, which include "the Bull", "Guardian of the Sacred Shields", "the Inexplicable" and "the Great Mountain".  The dances were described by William Smith of ''Time'' as "exhausting".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965396-2,00.html |title=Swaziland In the Kingdom of "Fire Eyes" |publisher=Time.com |author=William E.

====Toro Kingdom====
The [[Toro Kingdom]]<U+2014>located in modern [[Uganda]]<U+2014>crowned its current ruler, [[Rukidi IV of Toro|Rukidi IV]], on 12 September 1995.  Rukidi was the world's youngest monarch at the time, being only three years old.  The boy was awakened at 2AM, then led to the palace where the rites would take place.  At the entrance, Rukidi and his entourage engaged in a mock battle with a "rebel" prince, then entered to the accompaniment of the ''Omujaguza'', the traditional Toro war-drum.<ref name="safari1">[http://safariweb.com/safarimate/boyking.htm The Boy King].  From the ''safariweb.com'' website.  Contains photos from the ceremony.  Retrieved on 8 September 2008.</ref>

Once inside, Rukidi was led to the regalia room, where the ''Omusuga'', or head of royal rituals, called upon the gods to strike the boy dead if he was not of royal blood.  Once the Omusuga was satisfied as to the new king's lineage, Rukidi was permitted to ring the royal bell, then he sounded the ''Nyalebe'' or sacred drum, following which he was blessed with blood from a slaughtered bull and a white hen.  As morning broke, women (who had been barred from the ritual up to this time) were admitted to the palace.  The king was seated upon the lap of a virgin girl, and was fed with a royal meal of [[millet]] dough.  A coronation oath was administered with the boy lying on his side, in accordance with Toro tradition.<ref name="safari1"/>

At 10AM, the king, wearing a jewel-studded crown, was led to St. John's Anglican Cathedral where he was crowned by Anglican Bishop Eustance Kamanyire.  Rukidi was given a [[Bible]] by the local Roman Catholic prelate, then returned to his palace where he was presented with a centuries-old copper spear and leather shield.  Following this the king led a procession of Toro notables to inspect the royal [[corral]], then concluded his coronation by greeting his subjects from a traditional shed.<ref name="safari1"/>

Brazilian [[Emperor of Brazil|emperors]], of which there were two ([[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]), were crowned with the [[Imperial Crown of Brazil]] in a Catholic [[Coronation Mass]].

[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Faustin I]] of [[Haiti]] at his crowning, from the ''Illustrated London News''.]]
[[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], one of the founding fathers of [[Haiti]], proclaimed himself Emperor of Haiti soon after its independence.  He was crowned on 6 October 1804 in [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien|Le Cap]], but was assassinated two years later.  A [[Kingdom of Haiti]] was established in 1811 by [[Henri Christophe]], another leader in the Haitian independence struggle.  He was crowned in June 1811 in a lavish ritual presided over by Archbishop Corneil Breuil of Milot, but committed suicide in 1820.  Faustin-<U+00C9>lie Soulouque later proclaimed himself to be Emperor [[Faustin I of Haiti]]; he was crowned in an extremely elaborate ceremony held in [[Port-au-Prince]] on 18 April 1852, but was forced to abdicate in 1859, bringing his nascent Haitian ''imperium'' to an end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/stlazare/Haiti/Haiti%20Main.html |title=Haiti Main |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

====Mexico====
[[Mexico]] was twice ruled by emperors:  [[Agust<U+00ED>n de Iturbide]] ruled from 1822 to 1823; he was crowned in a lavish ceremony on 21 July 1822 at the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Catedral Metropolitana de Mexico]] in [[Mexico City]], placing the diadem on his own head just as Napoleon I did.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm |title=casa imperial de Mexico |publisher=Casaimperial.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>  Agustin was overthrown in March 1823, and the monarchy abolished.  Mexico's second monarch was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]], an Austrian [[archduke]] who was persuaded to take the newly-revived Mexican throne in 1864 by [[Napoleon III of France]] (whose troops, in conjunction with Mexican conservatives, had instituted it).  A [[Imperial Crown of Mexico|crown]] and sceptre were manufactured for an intended coronation at the Catedral Metropolitana, but the ceremony was never carried out due to the instability of Maximilian's regime.  Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces led by Mexican President [[Benito Juarez]] and executed in 1867, bringing his empire to an end.

====United States====
[[James J. Strang]], a would-be successor to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in the leadership of the [[Latter Day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] movement from 1844-56, openly established an ecclesiastical monarchy on [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]], [[Michigan]] in 1850.  On 8 July of that year, he staged an elaborate coronation ceremony complete with a throne, wooden sceptre, breastplate and a crown described by one observer as "a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1970/4/1970_4_4.shtml |title=AmericanHeritage.com / For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory ...

The [[King of Cambodia]] is crowned in a ceremony that combines [[Brahmanism|Brahmanic]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] elements.  The new monarch begins his coronation rite inside the [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|Royal Palace]] in [[Phnom Penh]] by placing two wreaths of [[jasmine]] atop a golden pillow. Then, bowing before the offerings, he lights a bundle of incense sticks and placed them around the table before taking a seat on the red-carpeted floor.  Prayers are read, punctuated by the sound of conch-shell horns.  The ruler then enters the Tevea Venichhay Temple, where he lights a stout candle encased in gold-gilded glass. This candle, which represents victory throughout the king<U+2019>s reign, is left burning until the final day of the coronation festival. Nine Buddhist monks then shower the King with jasmine buds.  Finally, the monarch makes his way to the throne, bowing three times to it before retreating to his private area of the palace.<ref name="camnet1">{{cite web|url=http://www.camnet.com.kh/cambodia.daily/coronation/coronation-2.htm |title=Royal Pledges |publisher=Camnet.com.kh |date= |accessdate=2009-06-20}}</ref>

The [[Islam]]ic [[Shah of Iran|Shahs of Persia]] (or [[Iran]], after 1935) crowned themselves in an elaborate coronation ritual staged in [[Tehran]], their capital.  The last of these was the coronation of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran]] in 1967.  The ceremony took place in the Grand Hall of the Golestan Palace, and commenced with the [[Imam]] Djomeh reciting several verses from the [[Quran]] and offering a special coronation prayer.  Following this, various items of the [[Iranian Crown Jewels|Iranian regalia]] were brought forward.  The Shah first received the Emerald Belt, followed by the Imperial Sword and Robe.  Finally, the [[Pahlavi Crown]] was presented, and the Iranian ruler placed it upon his own head in accordance with Iranian custom.  After this, the Shah was given the Imperial Sceptre, after which he crowned his empress and listened to three speeches.  The Shah then offered an address of his own, following which he received the homage of all male members of his family.

The [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese]] enthronement ceremony consists of three main parts.  The first takes place immediately after the death of the preceding sovereign.  The new emperor is given the [[Three Sacred Treasures of Japan]]: (1) a replica sword representing the sword [[ Kusanagi]]-no-Tsurugi (lit. "Grasscutter Sword") (<U+8349><U+8599><U+528D>)--the original being enshrined the in the [[Atsuta Shrine]] in [[Nagoya]]; (2) the [[Yasakani no magatama]] (<U+516B><U+5C3A><U+74CA><U+66F2><U+7389>), a necklace of comma-shaped stone beads; and (3) a mirror, called [[Yata no Kagami]] (<U+516B><U+54AB><U+93E1>).  Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler.  
 
The second part of the ceremony is the enthronement ritual itself, held in [[Kyoto]], the former capital of Japan.  The ritual is not public, and the regalia itself is generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few [[Shinto]] priests.  

The Daijo-sai or the Great Thanksgiving Festival is the final inauguration rituals, involving sacred rice, [[sake]], fish and a variety of other foods from both land and sea that are offered to the Sun-goddess Amaterasu-<U+014D>mikami.  This ceremony effects a singular union with the godess, thus making the new emperor (in Shinto tradition) the immediate intermediary between Amaterasu-<U+014D>mikami and the Japanese people.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-23/news/mn-5212_1_sun-goddess</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/23/world/akihito-performs-his-solitary-rite.html</ref>

====Jerusalem====
[[File:Maria of Montferrat Coronation.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Queen [[Mary I, Queen of Jerusalem|Maria]] and King [[John of Brienne|John I of Jerusalem]]]]

The first two [[Kings of Jerusalem]], [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] and [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]], were crowned in the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. Between 1131 and 1186, coronations were held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], was the only king crowned in Jerusalem in the 13th century.<ref name="Boas">{{cite book

The new monarch was dressed in the palace by the chamberlain. The chamberlain, who bore the royal sword, then headed procession to the Church in which the coronation ceremony took place. The chamberlain then handed the crown, sceptre and the rest of the regalia to the monarch. The coronation was followed by a feast for the noblemen who attended the ceremony.<ref name=Boas/>

The regalia possessed by the Kings of Jerusalem, as well as coronation ceremony itself, were influenced by those of Byzantine emperors.  The coronation of [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] was notably similar to the coronation of the Kings and Queens of Jerusalem.<ref name=Boas/>

====Korea====
A record of the 1724 coronation of Korean Emperor [[Yeongjo]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] has been preserved.  According to this account, Yeongjo began his crowning ritual at noon on 26 October, by entering the funeral chamber where his deceased predecessor, [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|Gyeongjong]], lay in state.  Having announced to his departed brother that he was assuming the royal mantle, Yeongjo burned incense before his remains, then entered the [[Changdeokgung|Injeongjeon Hall]], where he was seated upon his throne.  In the courtyard below, ranks of servants and bureaucrats bowed to him four times, shouting in unison each time: ''"Long live the king"!''  Following this, the new monarch left the throne room and changed back into mourning clothes for the reading of his accession edict.  The decree contained the new emperor's pledge to rule justly and benevolently; it equally promised reductions in criminal sentences, provisions for the needy, and gifts for all of Yeongjo's loyal officials.  The edict closed with a plea for help and cooperation throughout the reign to come.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haboush|first=JaHyun Kim |title=The Confucian Kingship in Korea: Y<U+014F>ngjo and the Politics of Sagacity|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2001|pages=29<U+2013>30|isbn=0231066570|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aD3VENtRJ4IC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Chinese+coronation+ceremony&source=web&ots=RFNSiJQoQF&sig=NYyyr1pXjv1qiaOl_DvwPVbW6NA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPP1,M1}}</ref> The Empire of Korea ended in 1910 with annexation by Japan, with the country subsequently splitting into a communist state (North) and republic (South) after the events of World War II.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

====Laos====
[[Laos]] crowned its [[King of Laos|kings]], with the last coronation being that of [[Sisavang Vong]] at the Royal Palace on 4 March 1905.  These rites included rituals in which the king made a symbolic payment to representatives of his people for their land, with them in turn acknowledging his legitimacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/49.htm |title=Laos&nbsp;<U+2014> Ethnic Diversity |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>  The last King of Laos, [[Savang Vatthana]], was not crowned due to a communist insurgency which led to the abolition of the Laotian monarchy in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princesomsanith.com/embroidery.jsp |title=The Official Website of Prince Somsanith |publisher=Princesomsanith.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

====Malaysia====
The nine royal rulers of [[Malaysia]] elect one of their number every five years to serve as [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], or King of Malaysia.  The new ruler is enthroned in a special ceremony after his election, which involves usage of several items of [[Royal Regalia of Malaysia|regalia]] including the ''Tengkolok Diraja'', or Royal Headdress<U+2014>as opposed to a crown.  According to legend, the first [[Sultan of Perak]] swore off the wearing of any diadems after the miraculous refloating of his ship, which had run aground during his journey to establish his reign in Perak.  Hence, while Malaysian coronations are rather elaborate affairs, they do not involve the imposition of a crown.  Instead, a special headdress is worn by the new king.

The new king proceeds into the Istana Negara Throne Hall at the head of a large procession also consisting of his spouse, specially-picked soldiers carrying the royal regalia, and other notables including the [[Grand Chamberlain]], or ''Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela''.  The king and his wife are seated upon their thrones, and the regalia are brought forward.  Following this, the ''Datuk Paduka Maharaja Lela'' brings forward a copy of the [[Quran]], which the new monarch reverently receives, kisses, and places on a special table located between his throne and the queen's.  A formal proclamation of the new king's reign is read, followed by the taking of a special coronation oath.  The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] gives a special speech, which is followed by an address by the new king from the throne.  A prayer is said, the Quran as returned to the Chamberlain, and the ceremony is completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk4/rk4.htm |title=Yang di-Pertuan Agong |publisher=Malaysianmonarchy.org.my |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

====Nepal====
Kings of [[Nepal]] were crowned in a [[Hindu]] ceremony whose date was determined by court [[Astrology|astrologers]].  Prior to the actual coronation, eight different kinds of [[clay]] were ceremonially applied to various parts of his body, and the new king took a ritual bath in [[holy water]]. Afterwards he was sprinkled with clarified butter, milk, curd and honey by representatives of the four traditional Hindu [[caste]]s: a Brahman, a warrior, a merchant and an Untouchable. Only then was  he ready to be crowned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917193,00.html |title=Coronation in Katmandu&nbsp;<U+2014> TIME |publisher=Time.com |author=Monday, Mar. 10, 1975 |date=March 10, 1975 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>  At precisely the "right" moment, the royal priest placed a jewel-studded crown<ref group="N">A photo of the last Nepalese king, [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]], in coronation regalia may be seen at [http://www.messiah.edu/acdept/depthome/History/king_gyanendra.jpg Cross-Cultural Studies: Ethnographic Performances in Nepal (May 2004)].</ref> on the new king's head.  The royals next rode on elephants through the streets of [[Kathmandu]], together with other distinguished guests.

The Nepalese monarchy was [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|abolished]] in 2008, following several years of pro-democracy and [[Maoist]] agitation.

====Thailand====
[[Thailand]] holds a coronation ceremony for its [[King of Thailand|king]] upon his accession to the throne.  The last such ritual was held on 5 May 1950, upon the accession of the current monarch, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]].  This ceremony included several ancient [[Buddhist]] and [[Brahmanism|Brahmanic]] rites, including the presentation of a nine-tiered umbrella (symbol of royal authority) and other items of the royal regalia to the sovereign.  Without this, no Thai king can assume the title of "Phrabat" or use the umbrella.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/457/news.shtml |title=Pattaya Mail&nbsp;<U+2014> Pattaya's First English Language Newspaper |publisher=Pattayamail.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

Bhumibol's coronation began with a ceremonial bath, following which the new king put on the white robes of a Brahmin [[monk]], and had sacred water poured over his shoulders while a "[[gong]] of victory" was struck by the court [[astrologer]].  Afterwards, he received nine pitchers filled with sacred water, drawn from eighteen different sites in Thailand.  The nine-tiered umbrella was then presented, followed by five other items of the royal regalia: the Golden Crown, the Royal Ancestral Sword, the Whisk of the Tail Hairs of a White [[Elephant]], a Small Flat Fan, and a pair of Golden Slippers.  In accordance with Thai tradition, Bhumibol placed the crown upon his own head, then received a special golden Ring of Kingship.<ref name="pattayamail1">{{cite web|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/353/features.htm |title=Pattaya Mail Features |publisher=Pattayamail.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref>

After this, the new Thai ruler seated himself upon the Bhatarabit Throne at the [[Grand Palace]], where he pronounced the Oath of Accession, promising that he would reign for the benefit and happiness of his people.  He also poured ceremonial water to symbolize his complete dedication to his royal responsibilities, in accordance with the "Tenfold Moral Principles of the Sovereign": alms-giving and charity, strict moral standards, self-sacrifice, honesty and integrity, courtesy and kindness, austerity in his habits, harboring no anger or hatred, practicing and promoting non-violence, exuding patience, forbearance and tolerance, and displaying impartiality to all.  After this, Bhumibol elevated his wife, Sirikit, to be the Queen of Thailand.  Finally, the royal couple visited the [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]] where he made a solemn vow to protect the Buddhist religion.<ref name="pattayamail1"/>

===Eastern Europe===
====Albania====
King [[Zog I]], last monarch of modern [[Albania]], was crowned in a ritual that took place on 1 September 1928. His coronation attire included rose-colored breeches, gold spurs, and a gold crown weighing seven and five-eighths pounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frosina.org/about/infobits.asp?id=141 |title=Welcome to Frosina.org :: An Albanian Immigrant and Cultural Resource |publisher=Frosina.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> Europe's only [[Muslim]] king swore a required constitutional oath on the Bible and the [[Quran]], symbolizing his desire to unify his country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albca.com/aclis/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=856 |title=ACLIS&nbsp;<U+2014> Albanian Canadian League Information Service&nbsp;<U+2014> A logistic office of Albanian Canadian League&nbsp;<U+2014> Albania's King Zog Buys Gold Coast Estate |publisher=Albca.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Zog was forced into exile by Italian invaders in 1939, and the monarchy was formally abolished in 1945.

====Bosnia====
The first crowned ruler of [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] was [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Stephen Tvrtko I]]. His coronation, held on 26 October 1377, created the Kingdom of Bosnia. It was traditionally held that Stephen Tvrtko I was crowned in the [[Mile<U+0161>evo monastery]] by its [[metropolitan bishop]] <ref name=Fine> John Van Antwerp Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest'', University of Michigan Press, 1987</ref>, but it has been proposed that he was crowned in the monastery of Mile, where most Bosnian coronations were held, with crown sent by King [[Louis I of Hungary]]. <ref name=Lambert> Malcolm D. Lambert, ''The Cathars'', Blackwell Publishing, 1998</ref><ref name=Velikonja> Mitja Velikonja, ''Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina'', Texas A&M University Press, 2003</ref>

The last coronation in Bosnia was held in [[Jajce]] in November 1461. Although all kings of Bosnia were at least formally Roman Catholic, only the last king, [[Stephen Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107> of Bosnia|Stephen Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], was crowned with the Pope's approval and with crown sent by [[Pope Pius II]]. The coronation was performed by papal legate. <ref name=Velikonja/> The Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist when Stephen Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107> was overthrown by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] and executed in June 1463.

====Bulgaria====
The rulers of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] were crowned in the same manner as Byzantine emperors, while the manner of coronation of the rulers of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] remains unknown. <ref name=Sedlar/>

While [[Bulgaria]] was a monarchy from its independence in 1878 until 1946, no modern [[King of Bulgaria|Bulgarian king]] was ever crowned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warholm.nu/FAQbul.html |title=Namnl<U+00F6>st dokument |publisher=Warholm.nu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

In 1102, upon the death of the last member of the [[House of Trpimirovi<U+0107>]], Croatia entered a [[personal union]] with Hungary. It was agreed that every King of Hungary would come to Croatia for a separate coronation as King of Croatia. This second coronation was required to soothe Croatian sensibilities, by demonstrating that Croatia remained an independent state. The last King of Croatia to be crowned in Croatia was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]. His son and successor, King [[Bela IV of Hungary]], refused to be crowned in Croatia in 1235, and the custom afterward died out.<ref name=Sedlar/><ref name="Fine">{{cite book

In 1941, [[Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta]], was installed as King of Croatia. The Italians planned to have Aimone crowned as Tomislav II at the Field of Duvno, where Tomislav I was allegedly crowned. The coronation was never held, due to Italy taking some of Dalmatia's coastal territory.<ref name=Rodogno/>

====Greece====
Although [[Greece]] retains a set of [[Greek Crown Jewels|crown jewels]] given to it by its first king, [[Otto I of Greece|Otto I]], no Greek king was ever crowned with them. The Greek monarchy was abolished in 1974.

====Hungary====
{{Main|Coronation of the Hungarian monarch}}
[[File:Karloath.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Karl of Austria|Charles IV of Hungary]] taking his coronation oath]]

Rulers of Hungary were not considered legitimate monarchs until they were crowned King of Hungary with the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]]. As women were not considered fit to rule Hungary, the two queens regnant, [[Mary of Hungary|Maria I]] and [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria II Theresa]], were crowned ''kings'' of Hungary. <ref name=Newman> Bernard Newman, ''The New Europe'', 1972</ref>  All Hungarian coronations took place at [[Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]], the burial place of the first crowned ruler of Hungary, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]].  The final such rite was held in [[Budapest]] on 30 December 1916, when Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] and Empress [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma|Zita]] were crowned as King Charles IV and Queen Zita of Hungary. The Hungarian monarchy perished with the end of [[World War I]], although the nation would later restore a titular monarchy from 1920-45<U+2014>while [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|forbidding]] Charles to resume the throne. A [[communist]] takeover in 1945 spelled the final end of this "kingdom without a king".

====Poland====
{{Main|Royal coronations in Poland}}

[[Poland]] crowned its rulers beginning in 1025; the final such ceremony occurred in 1764, when the last Polish King, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]], was crowned at [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw]]. Other coronations took place at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], and also in [[Pozna<U+0144>]] and [[Gniezno Cathedral]]. Though many of the [[Polish Crown Jewels]] were destroyed by Prussian King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], a few pieces are exhibited at the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. Polish coronations were whenever possible conducted as close as possible to the date of the previous sovereign's funeral; this was a concept expressed by Joachim Bielski in the sixteenth century: ''osoba umiera, korona nie umiera'' (the royal person dies, the crown dies not).<ref>M. Bielski, ''Kronika polska'', 1st ed. (1597, reprinted Sanok, 1856), 3:1207.</ref>

====Romania====
[[File:Crowning of Carol I, 10 May 1881.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of King [[Carol I of Romania]]]]

[[Romania]] used a coronation ceremony during its monarchial period (1881-1947). [[Steel Crown of Romania|Its crown]] was rather unique, being made of [[steel]] rather than [[gold]] or some other [[precious metal]]. In 1922, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] and Queen [[Marie of Edinburgh|Marie]] were crowned on the public square in [[Alba Iulia]], an important city in the new Romanian province of [[Transylvania]]. The coronation service was interdenominational rather than [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] (the majority religion and then the [[State religion|state church]]), in part because Ferdinand was Roman Catholic, while his wife was [[Anglican]] at the time. Ferdinand's son, [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], intended to be crowned in September 1930, but abandoned his plans due to marital difficulties with his wife, [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]], which included an ongoing affair with [[Magda Lupescu]]. Upon his abdication, his son, [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]], was crowned and anointed on 6 September 1940 at the [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral]] in [[Bucharest]] by [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch]] [[Nicodim Munteanu]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/bejan2-7.htm "The Joys of Suffering," Volume 2, "Dialogue with a few intellectuals"], by Rev.

====Russia====
{{Main|Coronation of the Russian monarch}}
[[File:Tuksenwed.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and Empress [[Alix of Hesse|Maria Feodorovna]]]]

Following the tradition of the [[Byzantine Emperor]]s, the Tsar placed the [[Imperial Crown of Russia|crown]] upon his own head. This was intended to indicate the imperial power, which the Tsars viewed as the direct [[Third Rome|continuation]] of the Christian Roman Empire (see [[Byzantium]]), came directly from God. The prayer of the [[Metropolitan archbishop|Metropolitan]], similar to that of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] for the Byzantine Emperor, confirmed the imperial supremacy.

After the Tsar recited the [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] [[Nicene Creed]], an invocation of the [[Holy Ghost]] and a litany were intoned. Following this, the emperor assumed the purple [[Chlamys]], and the crown was presented to him. He took it and placed it upon his own head.

The Tsar next received other items of the Imperial regalia, and was seated upon his throne. His wife then knelt before him. He handed the orb and sceptre to an attendant, then took off his crown and placed it briefly upon her head before returning it to his own. The Tsar next placed a smaller crown upon his consort's head, and a purple mantle, signifying her sharing in his imperial dignity and responsibility for the nation's welfare. Following this, both Tsar and Tsaritsa were anointed with [[myrrh]] by the presiding prelate.

Russia's last coronation was that of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and Tsaritsa [[Alix of Hesse|Alexandra Feodorovna]] in 1896. The last occasion on which the Imperial Crown was officially used was the State Opening of the [[Duma]] in 1906.

====Serbia and Yugoslavia====
[[File:Jugo1.JPG|thumb|right|King [[Peter I of Serbia]] immediately after his coronation]]

The first crowned King of Serbia, [[Stefan Nemanji<U+0107>|Stephen Nemanji<U+0107>]], was crowned twice. In 1217, he was crowned in a Roman Catholic ceremony by papal legate with crown sent by the Pope. However, Stephen and the Serbian people were Eastern Orthodox, so he appealed to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Patriarch elevated Stephan's brother [[Saint Sava|Sava]] to the rank of archbishop of Eastern Orthodox Church and authorized Stephan's second coronation, performed by Sava himself in 1222.<ref name="Schevill">{{cite book

Nevertheless, the coronation ceremony was an elaborate replica of Byzantine coronation.<ref name=Fine/>

[[Serbia]]'s last coronation was in 1904, when King [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter I]] was crowned in an [[Orthodox Christian]] ceremony at the Cathedral of the Host of Holy Archangels in [[Belgrade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos73.htm |title=The Serbian Revolution of 1903 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> Serbia became a part of the state of [[Yugoslavia]] after World War I, but Peter did not hold a second coronation and neither of his two successors, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] and [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], was crowned.

===Western Europe===
====Austria====
[[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] were never physically crowned (unlike their predecessors in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), as a coronation was not viewed as being necessary to legitimize their rule in that country. However, these rulers were sometimes crowned in other portions of their domain. For instance, [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] was crowned [[King of Bohemia]] with the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]] in 1836, and as King of [[Kingdom of Lombardy and Venetia|Lombardy and Venetia]] in 1838, using the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].

[[Habsburg]] emperors of Austria were crowned as [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] during their rule over that country.

====Bavaria====
A kingdom from 1806-1918, [[Bavaria]] possessed its own set of [[Bavarian Crown Jewels|crown jewels]]. However, there was no coronation ceremony, and the king never wore the crown in public. Rather, it was placed on a cushion at his feet. The Bavarian monarchy was abolished in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residenz-muenchen.de/englisch/treasury/pic01.htm |title=Bavarian Palace Department &#124; Munich Residenz &#124; Treasury &#124; Picture gallery |publisher=Residenz-muenchen.de |date= |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

====Belgium====
Belgium has no crown (except as a heraldic emblem); the monarch's formal installation requires only a solemn oath on the constitution in parliament, symbolic of the limited power allowed to the king under the [[Constitution of Belgium|1831 Constitution]]. During the enthronements of [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] and [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], one legislator cried "long live the Republic of Europe", only to be shouted down by the others, who cried "Vive le Roi", with the entire chamber rising to applaud the king.

====Denmark====
[[File:Christian 8 coronation.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Christian VIII of Denmark]], from a contemporary engraving, 1840.]]
[[Denmark|Danish]] enthronements may be divided into three distinct types of rituals: the medieval coronation, which existed during the period of [[elective monarchy]]; the anointing ritual, which replaced coronation with the introduction of [[absolute monarchy]] in 1660; and finally the simple proclamation, which has been used since the introduction of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] in 1849.

The coronation ritual (as of 1537) began with a procession of the ruler and his consort into St. Mary's cathedral in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]], followed by the [[Danish crown jewels]]. The monarch was seated before the altar, where he swore to govern justly, preserve the [[Lutheran]] religion, support schools, and help the poor. Following this, the king was anointed on the lower right arm and between the shoulders, but not on the head. Then the royal couple retired to a tented enclosure where they were robed in royal attire, returning to hear a sermon, the Kyrie and Gloria, and then a prayer and the [[Epistle]] reading.

Following the Epistle, the king knelt before the altar, where he was first given a sword. After flourishing and sheathing it, the still-kneeling monarch was crowned by the clergy and nobility, who jointly placed the diadem upon their ruler's head. The sceptre and orb were presented, then returned to attendants. The queen was anointed and crowned in a similar manner, but she received only a sceptre and not an orb. Finally, a choral hymn was sung, following which the newly-crowned royals listened to a second sermon and the reading of the [[Gospel]], which brought the service to an end.<ref name="escholarship1">{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Erich|title=Coronations: Medieval and Early Modern Monarchic Ritual|editor=Bak, J<U+00E1>nos M|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=1990|chapter=Coronation and Coronation Ordines in Medieval Scandinavia|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft367nb2f3&chunk.id=0&doc.view=print|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

In 1660 the coronation ritual was replaced with a ceremony of [[Anointment|anointing]], where the new king would arrive at the coronation site already wearing the crown, where he was then anointed. This rite was in turn abolished with the introduction of the Danish Constitution in 1849. Today the [[Danish Crown Regalia|crown of Denmark]] is only displayed at the monarch's funeral, when it sits atop their coffin. The present Queen, [[Margrethe II]], did not have any formal enthronement service; a public announcement of her accession was made from the balcony of Christianborg Palace, with the new sovereign being acclaimed by her Prime Minister at the time (1972), Otto Krag, then cheered with a ninefold "hurrah" by the crowds below.

====France====
{{main|Coronation of the French monarch}}
[[File:Coronation of Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile 1223.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]] at [[Reims]] in 1223; a [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'', circa 1450.]]
A coronation following the Byzantine formula was instigated in France with the crowning of King [[Clovis I]] of the [[Franks]] at [[Rheims]] in 497 A.D.  The French coronation ritual was similar to that used in England. The last royal coronation was that of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], in 1824.  Heirs to the French throne were also sometimes crowned during their predecessors' reigns during the [[Middle Ages]], but this was discontinued as laws of [[primogeniture]] became stronger.

During the [[First French Empire]], Emperor [[Napoleon I]] and Empress [[Jos<U+00E9>phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] were crowned in December 1804 in an extremely elaborate ritual presided over by [[Pope Pius VII]] and conducted at the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in [[Paris]].  [[Napoleon III]] chose not to be crowned.  The French republican government broke up and sold off most of the [[Crown Jewels]], in hopes of avoiding any public sentiment for a restoration of the monarchy after the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] in 1871.

====Italy====
The medieval Monarchs of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] were crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], usually at [[Pavia]] or [[Milan]].  From the 9th to the 18th century, the Kings of Italy were also the Holy Roman Emperors, so many of them were crowned in Germany, with the Iron Crown in Pavia, and then by the Pope in Rome. The last coronation with the Iron Crown was Napoleon I's in 1805.  The modern [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], which existed from 1861 to 1946, did not crown its monarchs.<ref name="catholic1"/>

====Liechtenstein====
Liechtenstein does not use a coronation or enthronement ceremony, although Prince [[Hans Adam II]] did attend a mass by the Archbishop of [[Vaduz]], followed by a choral display. Liechtenstein has no royal crown or regalia.

====Luxembourg====
The [[Grand Duke]] of Luxembourg is enthroned at a ceremony held in the nation's parliament at the beginning of his or her reign. The monarch takes an oath of loyalty to the state constitution, then attends a solemn mass at the [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]]. No crown or other regalia exists for the rulers of Europe's last sovereign [[Grand Duchy]].

====Monaco====
The Principality of [[Monaco]] does not possess any regalia, and thus does not physically crown its ruler. However, the Prince or Princess does attend a special investiture ceremony, consisting of a festive mass in the Cathedral of Monaco, followed by a reception where the new ruler meets his subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2005/07/12/nation/doc42d448a5e0bbd344366479.prt |title=Prince Albert takes Monaco's throne |publisher=Journalstar.com |author=Angela Doland |date= July 12, 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref>

====Netherlands====
Although the Netherlands has a [[Crown of the Netherlands|crown]] and other regalia, these have never been physically bestowed upon any Dutch monarch. [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] of the [[Netherlands]], like each of her predecessors, had an inauguration ceremony rather than a coronation. This ritual was held at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], in the capital city of [[Amsterdam]]. The crown, orb and sceptre were placed on cushions surrounding a copy of the Dutch constitution, with the Queen seated on a throne opposite them as she took her formal oath to uphold the kingdom's fundamental law.

====Norway====
{{Main|Royal coronations in Norway}}
[[File:H7 cor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud]] of Norway wearing their coronation crowns and robes in 1906.]]
The first coronation in Norway, and Scandinavia, took place in [[Bergen]] in 1163 or 1164. The Christ Church (Old Cathedral) in Bergen remained the place of coronations in Norway until the capital was moved to [[Oslo]] under King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]]. From then on some coronations were held in Oslo, but most were held in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]].<ref name="escholarship1"/>

While the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] of 1814 required the [[King of Norway]] to be [[Royal coronations in Norway|crowned]] in Trondheim, this mandate was repealed in 1908.  Thereafter, the ruler has only been required to take his formal accession oath in the [[Council of State]] and thereafter in the Parliament, the [[Stortinget|Storting]].  King [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]], desiring a religious ceremony to mark his ascession to the throne in 1957, instituted a ceremony of royal consecration, known as {{lang|no|''Signing til kongsgjerning''}}.  This ritual took place again in 1991, when [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]] were similarly consecrated.

====Portugal====
In 1646, immediately after his Coronation, King [[John IV of Portugal]] consecrated the Crown of Portugal to the [[Virgin Mary]], proclaiming her to be the Queen and patroness of his nation. After this act, no Portuguese sovereign ever wore a crown.<ref>http://www.gardnermuseum.org/press_releases/2008/luxury/luxury_for_export_catalogue_entries.pdf</ref> The Portuguese monarchy was abolished in 1910.

John IV's Coronation followed a pattern similar to the Coronation of the Kings of France and pre-reformation England, as laid out in the [[Roman Pontifical]]. The Spanish Hapsburg monarchs that preceded John IV as Kings of Portugal were also not crowned; during the [[Iberian Union]], the Spanish practice of not having a coronation ceremony was extended to Portugal.

Before the assumption of the Portuguese Throne by the Spanish Hapsburgs, Kings of Portugal used to be anointed and crowned in the [[Jeronimos Monastery]] in Lisbon, in a manner similar to the Coronation of John IV.

====Prussia====
[[File:Adolf Menzel - Kr<U+00F6>nung K<U+00F6>nig Wilhelms I. in K<U+00F6>nigsberg im Jahre 1861.jpg|thumb|Coronation of King [[William I of Prussia]]]]
[[William I of Prussia|William I]] was crowned in 1861 as King of Prussia, prior to the establishment of the German Empire (1871). He was crowned with great pomp, becoming the first king to be crowned in Prussia since the coronation of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] in 1701, although a significant number of politicians opposed the idea. William I took the crown with his own hands from the altar and crowned himself, while saying that he was receiving the crown from God's hands. These words were intended as a warning to Prussian Constitutionalists and Liberals. <ref name=BarnettSmith> George Barnett Smith, ''William I. and the German empire. A biographical and historical sketch'', London, S. Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1887</ref>

The King of Prussia was also ruler of [[Imperial Germany]] from 1871 to 1918. Although a design and model for a [[German State Crown]] were made, no final diadem was ever produced, and none of three German emperors were ever formally crowned. 

====Scotland====
[[File:Alexander III and Ollamh R<U+00ED>gh.JPG|thumb|right|Coronation of King [[Alexander III of Scotland]] on [[Moot Hill]], [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]]. He is being greeted by the ''ollamh r<U+00ED>gh'', the royal poet.]]
:''This section describes coronations held in Scotland prior to its unification with England.  For coronations after that time, see below under "[[Coronation#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]".''

Kings of [[Scotland]] were crowned at [[Scone Abbey]], in the town of [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], a few miles north of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. Prior to 1296, the king was seated upon the famed [[Stone of Scone]] throughout the ceremony; this was considered an essential element of the ritual.<ref>Philip Coppens, [http://www.philipcoppens.com/stone_destiny.html The Stone of Destiny: Sacred Kingship in the 21st Century]. From the personal website of Philip Coppens. Retrieved on 21 September 2008.</ref> Following the removal of the stone to England by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], coronations continued to be staged at the abbey or at [[Stirling, Scotland|Stirling]]. Scotland has its own [[Crown of Scotland|crown jewels]], which were used in all coronation ceremonies up to that of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the final king to be crowned in Scotland.

One feature of Scottish coronations was the ''ollamh r<U+00ED>gh'', or royal poet, who addressed the new monarch with ''Beannachd D<U+00E9> R<U+00ED>gh Alban'', or "God Bless the King of Scotland". The poet went on to recite the monarch's [[genealogy]] back to the first ever [[Scottish people|Scotsman]]. It was traditional in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]-speaking cultures like Scotland that a king's legitimacy be established by recitation of the royal pedigree.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=John Bannerman (historian) |last=Bannerman|first=John|year=1989|title=The King's Poet|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|volume=V. LXVIII}}</ref> Scottish rulers did not necessarily have to wait for any certain age to be crowned: [[Mary I of Scotland|Mary I]] was crowned at nine months of age, while her son, [[James I of England|James VI]], was crowned at thirteen months. Mary's father, [[James V of Scotland|James V]], was barely seventeen months of age at the time of his coronation. After the unification with England, the Scottish coronation rite was subsumed into the British.

====Sicily and Naples====
[[File:Benedetto da Maiano, incoronazione di ferdinando d'aragona da parte dela cardinale latino orsini nel 1459.JPG|right|thumb|Coronation of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand III of Naples]]]]
The exact coronation customs of the [[List of rulers of Sicily|Kings and Queens of Sicily]] are disputed. According to a Cassino manuscript of c. 1200, the coronation of the Kings of Sicily was based on a German model, though variations were made to adapt it to Sicilian tradition.

Several different parts were included in the coronation ceremony. First, the new monarch was asked whether he wished to be the defender of the Church and a just ruler of his kingdom. After that, the people were asked whether they wish to submit themselves to the person who was to be crowned. The king or queen were then anointed on their hands, head, chest and both shoulders. The monarch was then girded with sword and vested with ''armillas'', ''[[pallium]]'', and ring. The sceptre was put in their right hand and the orb in their left hand. Finally, the presiding archbishop placed the crown on the monarch's head. <ref name="Matthew">{{cite book

====Spain====
No monarch of Spain has been crowned as such since [[John I of Castile]]. Instead, the new monarch appears at the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]], where he or she takes a formal oath to uphold the Constitution. Although the [[Spanish Royal Crown|crown]] is evident at the ceremony, it is never actually placed on the monarch's head. Five days after his visit to the Cortes, current Spanish King [[Juan Carlos I]] attended an "Enthronement Mass" at the Church of San Jer<U+00F3>nimo el Real in [[Madrid]]. Accompanied by his wife [[Queen Sofia of Spain|Sofia]], he was escorted beneath a canopy to a set of thrones set up near the high altar. Following the service, the Royals returned to the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|palace]], where they greeted their subjects from the balcony, reviewed troops and attended a formal banquet.

Historical Castilian coronations were performed at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], or in the Church of St Jerome at Madrid, with the king being anointed by the archbishop of Toledo.<ref name=Britannica11/> The monarch assumed the royal sword, sceptre, crown of gold and the apple of gold, after receiving his anointing.<ref name="encyclopedia1"/> Aragonese coronations were performed at [[Zaragoza]] by the [[Archbishop of Tarragona]].<ref name="Matthew">{{cite book

====Sweden====
[[File:Gustav IIIs coronation StockholmStorkyrkan com.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of King [[Gustav III of Sweden]]]]

In [[Sweden]], no [[King of Sweden|king]] has been crowned since [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in 1873. The current monarch, [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], was enthroned in a simple ceremony at the throne room of the Royal Palace in [[Stockholm, Sweden|Stockholm]] on 19 September 1973. The crown jewels were displayed on cushions to the right and left of the royal throne, but were never given to the king. Carl Gustaf made an accession speech, which comprised the main purpose of the undertaking.<ref name="escholarship1"/>

Previously, Swedish kings were crowned at the "Storkyrka", at Stockholm. The monarch was anointed by the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], highest prelate in the [[Church of Sweden]], on the breast, temples, forehead and palms of both hands. The crown was then placed on the king's head by the archbishop and the [[Minister of Justice]] jointly, whereupon the herald of the realm proclaimed: "Now is crowned king of the Swedes, Goths and Wends, he and no other".<ref name="catholic1"/><ref name="encyclopedia1"/> When there was a queen consort, she was then anointed, crowned and proclaimed in the same manner.  Earlier coronations were also held at [[Uppsala]], the ecclesiastical center of Sweden. Prior to Sweden's change into a hereditary monarchy, the focus of the coronation rite was on legitimising an elected king.<ref name="Hunt1">{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Alice|title=The Drama of Coronation: Medieval Ceremony in Early Modern England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2008|isbn=0521885396|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z5eZBJ6UXiAC&pg=PP2&lpg=PP2&dq=%22The+Drama+of+Coronation:+Medieval+Ceremony+in+Early+Modern+England%22&source=bl&ots=q773iFTCup&sig=O_2brScVvaaBSdtewGOsJGRACBo&hl=en&ei=FgdFSqKLM4jANsiJ9Z4B&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1|accessdate=2009-06-26|page=12}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Coronation of the British monarch}}
[[File:Coronation of Queen Victoria 28 June 1838 by Sir George Hayter.jpg|thumb|right|Coronation of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom]]]]

The [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation ceremony]] takes place in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Since the British sovereign is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]], and his or her coronation does not take place in a cathedral<U+2014>which would be the domain of a bishop<U+2014>but at Westminster Abbey, which is a [[Royal Peculiar]] (a church directly under the monarch). The king or queen enters the abbey in procession, and is seated on a "Chair of Estate" as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] goes to the east, south, west and north of the building asking if those present are willing to pay homage to their new ruler. Once the attendees respond affirmatively, the Archbishop administers the Coronation Oath, and a Bible is presented by both the Archbishop (representing the Church of England) and the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Once this is done, the actual crowning can take place.

The monarch is crowned while seated upon the ancient [[St. Edward's Chair]], or Coronation chair, which includes the Scottish [[Stone of Scone]]. A canopy is held over the new ruler's head, while the Archbishop anoints him or her with holy oil on the hands, breast and head, concluding with a special blessing. Spurs and the [[Sword of State]] are presented, followed by the [[Sovereign's Orb]] (which is immediately returned to the altar), the [[Sceptre with the Dove]] and the [[Sceptre with the Cross]]. Once this is done, the Archbishop of Canterbury places the [[St. Edward's Crown|Crown of St. Edward]] upon the monarch's head. If a [[queen consort]] is present, she is crowned at this point in a simple ritual.<ref group="N">This applies to female consorts only. If the new monarch is a female, her husband (if any) is not crowned.</ref> {{#tag:ref| For example, [[Anne Boleyn]] was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] with [[St. Edward's crown]] (which had previously been used to crown only a reigning monarch)<ref name="Hunt2">{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Alice|title=The Drama of Coronation: Medieval Ceremony in Early Modern England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2008|isbn=0521885396|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z5eZBJ6UXiAC&pg=PP2&lpg=PP2&dq=%22The+Drama+of+Coronation:+Medieval+Ceremony+in+Early+Modern+England%22&source=bl&ots=q773iFTCup&sig=O_2brScVvaaBSdtewGOsJGRACBo&hl=en&ei=FgdFSqKLM4jANsiJ9Z4B&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1|accessdate=2009-06-26|page=93}}</ref> because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and she was carrying the heir who was presumed to be male. Thus, Anne's coronation did not only legitimise her right to enjoy the title and prerogatives of Queen of England, but also [[Elizabeth I of England|her unborn child]]'s right to be crowned as monarch with St. Edward's Crown one day. Compare with coronation of an Heir Apparent, discussed [[#Coronation of heir apparent|above]], though in this case the child was not itself explicitly crowned.|group="N"}}

Afterwards, the new ruler is seated upon the throne, and receives homage from various members of the British clergy and nobility. [[Holy Communion]] is given to the sovereign, who then enters St. Edward's Chapel as the [[Te Deum]] is sung, where he or she exchanges St. Edward's Crown for the [[Imperial State Crown]] and exits the church wearing the crown and carrying the Sceptre with the Cross and Orb as "[[God Save the King]] (or Queen)" is sung.<ref name="oremus">{{cite web| url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html |title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in The Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953 |author=Kershaw, Simon |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref>

The ceremony as conducted in 1953 also functioned as the coronation rite for the [[Commonwealth realm|realms]] within the Commonwealth which recognise [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as their monarch, by the text of the administered oath including the seven separate Commonwealth kingdoms in existence as the time, as well as a general statement regarding other territories.{{#tag:ref|The text of the oath is as follows: "''Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs?"''<ref name="oremus"/>|group="N"}}

====The Vatican====
{{Main|Papal Coronation}}
From 1305 to 1963 the [[Pope]]s were crowned with the [[Papal Tiara]] in a [[Papal Coronation|coronation ceremony]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. Following the decision of the last crowned Pope, [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], to lay the Papal tiara on the high [[altar]] of the cathedral as a symbol of humility, the next three popes declined to wear it, and instituted a ceremony of [[papal inauguration]] rather than a formal coronation. While the popes [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (who also completely abandoned the use of the [[sedia gestatoria]], a portable throne) and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] opted for an inauguration instead of a coronation, any future pope can, in theory, opt for the coronation ritual.

===Oceania===
====Hawaii====
The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] held a coronation ritual for King [[Kalakaua]] and [[Queen Kapiolani]] in February 1883, nine years after his accession.  Prior to this, the two monarchs were inaugurated at [[Kawaiahao Church]], where the feather Cloak of [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha]] was placed upon their shoulders.  Two golden crowns were manufactured in England for Kalakaua's subsequent crowning ceremony, and a large pavilion was erected in front of the newly-completed [[Iolani Palace]], into which the royals proceeded accompanied by bearers carrying the ''kahili,'' the ancient symbols of Hawaiian royalty.  Given the diadem by a Reverend McIntosh, Kalakaua crowned himself, since no one was deemed sacred enough to crown an [[alii]].  He then crowned his queen.  When the crown was unable to sit on Kapiolani's hair, it was forced on, bringing the queen to tears.  Kalakaua's sister [[Liliuokalani]] reported that at the moment of his crowning, the sun was obscured by a cloud which gave way to reveal a single bright star.  Since this incident occurred during daylight, it caused a sensation among the assembled witnesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-3.html|title=Coronation Ceremonies, ''excerpt from'' Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen|author=Liliuokalani, Queen of Hawaii|year=1898}}</ref>

Liliuokalani, who succeeded Kalakua in 1891, did not have a coronation prior to her [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow]] in 1893 and the abolition of the Hawaiian monarchy.

====Tahiti====
[[Tahiti]] was ruled by [[King of Tahiti|native kings]] (and one queen) of the Pomare dynasty from 1788 to 1880, when the last monarch, [[Pomare V]], ceded his country to [[France]].  Details from the coronation ritual of [[Pomare II]], second King of Tahiti (1791), have been preserved.  The rite centered upon the ''maro ura'', a sacred [[girdle]] symbolizing Pomare's status and power comprised of yellow and red [[feather]]s, five yards long by fifteen inches wide.  Black feathers bordered the garment's top and bottom.  This robe also contained the auburn hair of Richard Skinner, one of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutineers]] from the [[H.M.S. Bounty]] who had elected to stay in Tahiti when [[Fletcher Christian]] set out for [[Pitcairn Island]].  As the ship's barber, Skinner commanded special prestige among Tahitians, who valued his red hair and wove some of it into their ''maro ura''.  Also incorporated into the girdle was a red British pennant, which [[Samuel Wallis]] of the ''H.M.S. Dolphin'' had raised on Tahiti when he took possession of it for the British crown in 1767.  The Tahitians had torn down this flag, and woven it into their royal robe as a symbol of their own sovereignty over their island.{{Fact|date=July 2009}}

To receive this cloak, Pomare went to his sacred [[marae]], donned the cloak, then took the left eyes of certain sacrificial victims and acted as if he were going to eat them.  He also listened to the cries of sacred birds and to a volley of musketry fired in his honor by certain ''Bounty'' mutineers who were on the scene.  Following this, the new king was treated to a dance, with Tahitian men pretending to cover him with excrement and semen as a kind of honor.{{Fact|date=July 2009}}

By 1824, when Pomare's son [[Pomare III]] was crowned, the Tahitian coronation ritual had changed significantly, under the influence of foreign [[Christian]] [[missionaries]].  This time, a European-style rite was enacted, with the new king escorted to the Royal Chapel in [[Papeete]] behind a procession of flower-strewing girls accompained by governors, judges and other civil servants.  After being anointed and crowned, Pomare was given a [[Bible]] and had a [[sermon]] preached to him.  The festivities concluded with the proclamation of an amnesty and a coronation banquet.{{Fact|date=July 2009}}

====Tonga====
In 1967 and again in 2008, [[Tonga]] crowned its king ([[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] and [[George Tupou V]], respectively) in elaborate ceremonies complete with a large gold crown, sceptre, and throne.  The Christian character of Tonga's monarchy was reiterated in the 2008 event&nbsp;<U+2014> as were Tonga's former ties to Great Britain&nbsp;<U+2014> as Anglican Archbishop of Polynesia Jabez Brice anointed King George Topou V with sacred chrism just as in the British rite.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4440717.ece|title=Lavish Coronation Ceremony For New King of Tonga|publisher=[[Times Online]]|date=2008-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/08/the_new_king_of_tonga.html|title=The New King of Tonga|author=Alan Taylor|publisher=Boston.com|date=2008-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmssirius.info/photos2.htm|title=Photos of George Tupou IV's coronation in 1967}}</ref> This ceremony, introduced to the islands by Western [[missionary|missionaries]], followed a centuries-old traditional Tongan rite, which involved the ritual drinking of [[kava]] by the new king, together with the receipt of dozens of cooked [[pig]]s and baskets of food.

==Other uses==
The term "coronation" is sometimes used in a semi-ironic sense{{By whom|date=June 2009}} to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election they are likely to lose.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}  This typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}
