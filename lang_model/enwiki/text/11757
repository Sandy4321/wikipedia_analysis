'''Gregory Taronites''' ({{lang-el|<U+0393><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03B3><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03A4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] prince of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]], who went over to [[Byzantine]] service and held senior commands and governorships under Emperor [[Basil II]]. He was killed by the [[Bulgarians]] at the [[Battle of Thessalonica (995)|Battle of Thessalonica]] in the early 990s.

==Life==
Gregory was a son of [[Ashot III of Taron|Ashot III]], prince of the region of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in southern [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]]. At Ashot's death in 968, Gregory and his brother, Bagrat (Pankratios in Greek) ceded Taron to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in exchange for extensive lands inside the Empire and the title of ''[[patrikios]]''.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=2012<U+2013>2013}}

The two brothers became involved in the Byzantine civil wars between Emperor [[Basil II]] (r. 976<U+2013>1025) and the mighty [[dynatoi|military aristocracy]] of [[Asia Minor]], led by [[Bardas Phokas the Younger]] and [[Bardas Skleros]]; they initially supported the latter, but soon switched over to the Emperor's side.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=2012<U+2013>2013}} In 988/9, according to the historian [[Yahya of Antioch]], Gregory, by now a ''[[magistros]]'', was sent to recruit an army at [[Trebizond]] and lead it against Bardas Skleros' core territory around the [[Euphrates]] border. He was defeated ''en route'' by Skleros' allies, the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]] under [[David of Tao]].{{sfn|Holmes|2005| pp=98 note 69, 320, 406 note 21}}{{sfn|Str<U+00E4>ssle|2006|p=78 note 1080}}

Following the suppression of the magnates' revolts, Basil II turned his attention to the [[Balkans]], where [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] was menacing the Byzantine territories. In 991 he campaigned in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and captured the fortress of [[Veroia|Berroia]], before returning to [[Constantinople]]. The emperor left Gregory Taronites in charge of the Balkan army and tasked him with stopping Samuel's raids.{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=195<U+2013>196, 406}}{{sfn|Str<U+00E4>ssle|2006|pp=90, 240}} Taronites was named ''[[dux|doux]]'' and made [[Thessalonica]] his seat. It is unclear whether in this context the title of ''doux'' implies simply a military command over the troops left behind, or, as usually interpreted, whether it includes the governorship of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Thessalonica (theme)|Thessalonica]] as well, which was previously held by a ''[[strategos]]''.{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=403<U+2013>404}}{{sfn|Str<U+00E4>ssle|2006|p=218 note 21}}

Some time after this, Gregory Taronites was killed by the Bulgarians in an ambush. A raiding party had approached Thessalonica, and Gregory sent out his son, [[Ashot Taronites|Ashot]], with the vanguard to make contact with them and reconnoitre. The over-eager Ashot engaged the Bulgarians and drove them back, but drawn into a prepared ambush and encircled with his men. His father, following up with the main Byzantine force, rushed to his rescue, but was killed.{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=165, 406<U+2013>407}} The exact date of this event is unknown. Armenian sources place it in 991, and while it is traditionally dated to 996 based on the account of [[John Skylitzes]], it must have happened in the early 990s, at any rate before 995/6, when [[John Chaldos]] is attested as ''doux'' of Thessalonica.{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=403<U+2013>404}}{{sfn|Str<U+00E4>ssle|2006|pp=78, 405}}

==Family==
Along with his brother, Gregory was the founder of the noble [[Taronites]] family, which remained prominent in Byzantium until the end of the 12th century.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=2012<U+2013>2013}} Gregory's son Ashot was captured by the Bulgarians, but ended up marrying Samuel's daughter [[Miroslava of Bulgaria|Miroslava]] and becoming governor of [[Dyrrhachium]], which he soon surrendered back to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Holmes|2005|pp=103<U+2013>104, 196}} Gregory had at least another child, a daughter Irene, which was wed to a member of another branch of the Taron line, [[Romanos Taronites]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=2012<U+2013>2013}}
