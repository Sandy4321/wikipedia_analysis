==Medal of Honor citation==
The [[President of the United States]] in the name of [[United States Congress|the Congress]] takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to
<center>
'''STAFF SERGEANT KARL G. TAYLOR''' <br>
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
</center>
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
<blockquote>
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Company Gunnery Sergeant during Operation MEADE RIVER in the [[Republic of Vietnam]] on the night of [[8 December]] [[1968]]. Informed that the commander of the lead platoon had been mortally wounded when his unit was pinned down by a heavy volume of enemy fire, Staff Sergeant Taylor along with another Marine, crawled forward to the beleaguered unit through a hail of hostile fire, shouted encouragement and instructions to the men, and deployed them to covered positions. With his companion, he then repeatedly maneuvered across an open area to rescue those Marines who were too seriously wounded to move by themselves. Upon learning that there were still other seriously wounded men lying in another open area, in proximity to an enemy [[machine gun]] position, Staff Sergeant Taylor, accompanied by four comrades, led his men forward across the fire-swept terrain in an attempt to rescue the Marines. When his group was halted by devastating fire, he directed his companion to return to the company command post; where-upon he took his [[grenade launcher]] and, in full view of the enemy, charged across the open rice paddy toward the machine gun position, firing his weapon as he ran. Although wounded several times, he succeeded in reaching the machine gun [[bunker]] and silencing the fire from that sector, moments before he was mortally wounded. Directly instrumental in saving the lives of several of his fellow Marines, Staff Sergeant Taylor, by his indomitable courage, inspiring leadership, and selfless dedication, upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].
