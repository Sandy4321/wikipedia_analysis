The '''Bengal Slow Loris''' (''Nycticebus bengalensis'') or '''Northern Slow Loris''' is the largest [[species]] of [[slow loris]] and is native to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Indochina]].  It is a [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]] with large eyes, round head, small ears, [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] tail, and dense, woolly fur.  It was recognized as a distinct species in 2001.

The species lives in small family groups, primarily eats fruit, and reproduces once every 12<U+2013>18&nbsp;months.  It is a [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]] and pollinator, as well as a prey item for carnivores. It prefers rainforests with dense [[canopy (biology)|canopies]], and its presence in its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem. The species is threatened with extinction due to a growing demand in the [[exotic pet]] trade and [[traditional medicine]].  It is also hunted for food and suffers from [[habitat loss]].  Wild populations have declined severely, and it is [[locally extinct]] in several regions.

==Taxonomy and distribution==
[[File:Nycticebus.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Bengal Slow Loris from the mid-19th century]]
''Nycticebus bengalensis'', [[common name|commonly]] known as the Bengal Slow Loris or Northern Slow Loris,<ref name=2006CITES/> is a strepsirrhine primate in the [[slow loris]] (genus ''Nycticebus''). Formerly considered a [[subspecies]] of ''[[Nycticebus coucang|N.&nbsp;coucang]]'', it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist [[Colin Groves]].{{Sfn|Groves|2005|pp=122<U+2013>123}} It is difficult to distinguish from the other species in its genus.<ref name=2006CITES/> ''N.&nbsp;bengalensis'' is considered the least well-known of the five slow loris species.<ref name=Nekaris2007/>

The species is native to [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Northeast India]] and [[Bangladesh]]) and [[Indochina]] ([[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]], [[Vietnam]], southern [[China]] and [[Thailand]]).  In India, it is found in [[Assam]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]].  It is found in parts of [[Yunnan]] and in southwest [[Guangxi]] in China, and has been recorded in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and from [[Garo Hills]] in Bangladesh. It is known from 24 protected areas in Vietnam, and is distributed across most of Thailand.  In Burma, it has been reported from [[Bhamo]], [[Sumprabum]], [[Kindat]], [[Chin Hills]], [[Pathein]], [[Thaungdaung]] and [[Pegu]]; populations in Laos have been recorded in the north, central, and southern portions of the country.<ref name=2006CITES/>

==Anatomy and physiology==
The Bengal Slow Loris is the largest species of slow loris, weighing {{convert|2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measuring between {{convert|26|and|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} from head to tail.  It has dense, woolly, brown-gray fur on its back and white fur on its underside.  It also has a clear dark stripe that runs over its head.  Like other slow lorises, its tail is [[vestigiality|vestigial]] and it has large eyes, a round head, and short ears.<ref name=2006CITES/><ref>{{cite doi | 10.1007/s10764-006-9057-9}}</ref>

Females reproduce every 12<U+2013>18&nbsp;months, usually giving birth to a single offspring, although twins rarely occur.  [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at approximately 20&nbsp;months of age.  The species is known to live up to 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=2006CITES/>

==Ecology==
The preferred habitats of the Bengal Slow Loris range across [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions, and include [[evergreen forest|evergreen]] and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense [[canopy (biology)|canopies]].<ref name=2006CITES/> It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip to the base of the [[crown (botany)|crown]]); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation.<ref name=Pliosungnoen2010/> Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.<ref name=2006CITES/>

The species acts as an important [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]] and pollinator, as well as a prey item for several carnivores.  The Bengal Slow Loris feeds on plant exudates such as [[sap]], [[natural gum|gum]]s, [[resin]]s, and [[latex]]es, particularly those from the family [[Fabaceae]]. Even though the species does not have keeled nails (where the thumb and the first and the second toes have claws), it will scrape the plant, actively breaking its surface; this behavior resembles that of [[marmoset]]s and the [[fork-marked lemur]]s.<ref name=Nekaris2010/> Exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark. The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates. The [[Bastard myrobala]] (''Terminalia belerica''), a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia, is a preferred source for exudates.<ref name=Swapna2010/> Although it will feed on gum, insects, snails, small birds, and reptiles, it is primarily [[Frugivore|frugivorous]].<ref name=2006CITES/> [[Liana]]s of the flowering plant genus ''[[Bauhinia]]'' are a commonly used food source.<ref name=Pliosungnoen2010/>

The species is known to live in small family groups.<ref name=2006CITES/>

==Conservation==
The Bengal Slow Loris is listed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) as "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]."<ref name="IUCN_N._bengalensis">{{IUCN | id = 39758 | taxon = Nycticebus bengalensis | assessors = Streicher, U., Singh, M., Timmins, R.J. & Brockelman, W. | assessment_year = 2008 | version = 2010.4 | accessdate = 9 January 2011}}</ref>  It is found within numerous [[protected area]]s within its range; however, [[poaching]] and [[illegal logging]] are rampant while conservation measures are not species-specific.  The species can be found in at least 43 protected areas in Northeast India, 14 conservation areas in Laos, and 24 protected areas in Vietnam.  It can be found at [[Lawachara National Park]] in Bangladesh, and 80% of its range is China is theoretically protected by reserves in China.<ref name=2006CITES/>

The most severe threats facing the species are the [[wildlife trade]] (trapping for [[exotic pet]]s and use in [[traditional medicine]]) and [[deforestation]].  [[Slash and burn]] agriculture has also resulted in the destruction of its habitat, while road construction has also played a role in its decline.  Hunting has been found to be most severe when nearby urban human populations increase.<ref name=2006CITES/>

The species is commonly sold as a pet and to zoos throughout Southeast Asia.  In Cambodia, it was reported in 2006 as one of the most common mammals found in shops and stalls, found in the hundreds and selling for US$0.85 to US$6.25.  In the same year, it was found selling for US$2.50 to US$6.30 at bazaars in China ([[Mengla County]] in the [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]]) and US$70 in Thailand.  The Bengal Slow Loris is used in traditional medicine in all of these countries, selling for US$15 in Vietnam, and is also eaten in Vietnam.<ref name=2006CITES/> The animal is predominantly used to prepare treatments for women after childbirth, stomach problems, healing wounds and broken bones, and in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Primary users are wealthy to middle class women in urban areas.<ref name=Starr2010/>

===Habitat and population trends===
Throughout its geographic range, slow lorises are in serious decline.  Their habitat has been seriously degraded, and growing human populations will add increasing pressure.  In countries like Bangladesh, only 9% of the original forest cover was still present in 2000.  In north-eastern Cambodia, forests are being cleared at an increasing rate, with a loss of 6% of the natural forest between 1999 and 2000.  Within those same years, Myanmar and Thailand lost 14% and 26% of their natural forest, respectively.  In Vietnam, only 30% of the original forest cover remains due to the deforestation caused by the [[Vietnam War]], and only 10% of that includes closed-canopy forests.  Habitat destruction remains rampant, and all slow loris populations within its borders are significantly depleted.  Populations have been declared [[Local extinction|locally extinct]] in southern [[Qu<U+1EA3>ng Nam Province]] and parts of the highlands, and the same is expected in [[Song Thanh]] and [[Kon Cha Rang]] nature reserves.<ref name=2006CITES/>

In India, dense forest canopy has been depleted by as much as 55% in some areas and is rapidly disappearing. As early as 1987, the Indo-China region had reportedly lost 75% of the natural habitat for slow lorises.  In 1992, the population size was estimated between 16<U+2013>17,000 individuals, based on available habitat; however, recent publications report few individuals remain due a reduced geographic range.  The Bengal Slow Loris may be restricted to a few isolated populations and is in serious threat of becoming locally extinct in parts of [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]].  In [[Arunachal Pradesh]], its population is declining and under threat. [[Population density]] has been estimated between 0.03 to 0.33 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> in various survey areas.<ref name=2006CITES/>

Since the 1990s, China's forests have declined significantly.  In [[Yunnan]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces, [[Old-growth forest|primary forests]] are few and isolated, and [[secondary forest]]s have been severely degraded.  Yunnan has lost 42% of its forests and has 2,000 or less slow lorises remain.  In Guangxi, the Bengal Slow Loris is nearly extinct, having been extirpated in [[Ningming County]] and only a few individuals are left in [[Jingxi County|Jingxi]], [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]] and [[Pingxiang County|Pingxiang]].<ref name=2006CITES/>
