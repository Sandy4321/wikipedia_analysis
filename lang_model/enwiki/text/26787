'''Truman Capote''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|[<U+02C8>tru<U+02D0>.m<U+0259>n k<U+0259><U+02C8>po<U+028A>.<U+027E>i]}}) ([[30 September]], [[1924]] &ndash;  [[25 August]], [[1984]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] whose non-fiction, stories, novels and plays are recognized literary classics, including the [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ([[1958 in literature|1958]]) and ''[[In Cold Blood (book)|In Cold Blood]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]), which he labeled a "non-fiction novel." At least 20 films and TV dramas have been produced from Capote novels, stories and screenplays. 

==Early life==
Truman Capote was born '''Truman Streckfus Persons''' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], to Archulus Persons, a salesman, and his 16-year-old wife, the former Lillie Mae Faulk. When he was four, his parents divorced, and he was sent to [[Monroeville, Alabama]], where he was raised by his mother's relatives. "Her face is remarkable <U+2014> not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind," described Capote in "A Christmas Memory" his distant relative Sook, Nanny Rumbley Faulk. 

As a lonely child, Capote taught himself to read and write before he entered the first grade in school. He was a neighbor and friend of the author of the novel [[To Kill a Mockingbird]], [[Harper Lee]]. A character in the book, Dill, is said to be based on Capote. 
[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0930.html] He was often seen at age five carrying his dictionary and notepad, and he claimed to have written a book when he was nine years old. At this time, he was given the nickname '''Bulldog''', <ref>Walter, Eugene, as told to Katherine Clark. ''Milking the Moon: A Southerner's Story of Life on This Planet''. Crown, 2001.</ref> possibly a pun reference of "Bulldog Truman" to the fictional detective, [[Bulldog Drummond]], popular in films of the mid-1930s.

On Saturdays, he made trips from Monroeville to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], and when he was ten, he submitted his short story, "Old Mr. Busybody," to a children's writing contest sponsored by the ''[[Press-Register|Mobile Press Register]]''. When he was 11, he began writing seriously in daily three-hour sessions. Of his early days Capote related, "I began writing really sort of seriously when I was about eleven. I say seriously in the sense that like other kids go home and practice the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it."

In 1933, he moved to [[New York City]] to live with his mother and her second husband, Joseph Capote, a Cuban-born textile broker, who adopted his stepson and renamed him '''Truman Garc<U+00ED>a Capote.''' In 1935, he attended the [[Trinity School (New York)|Trinity School]]. He then attended St. Joseph's military academy. His mother wished for him to become more masculine. She said, "I will not have another child like Truman, and if I do have another child he will be like Truman." She aborted two pregnancies for this reason. In 1939, the Capotes moved to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and Truman attended [[Greenwich High School]], where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, ''The Green Witch'', and the school newspaper. Back in New York in 1942, he graduated from the [[Dwight School]], an Upper West Side private school where an award is now given annually in his name.

When he was 17, Capote ended his formal education and began a two-year job at ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Years later, he wrote, "Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, I was fortunate to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn't a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, at least in my own case." He was fired from this job for misrepresenting himself as a writer for the magazine, when he was really little more than a copy boy.

Between [[1943 in literature|1943]] and [[1946 in literature|1946]], Capote wrote a continual flow of short fiction, including "A Mink of One's Own," "Miriam," (for which he won the O. Henry award) "My Side of the Matter," "Preacher's Legend," "Shut a Final Door" and "The Walls Are Cold." These stories were published in both literary quarterlies and well-known magazines, including ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''Prairie Schooner'' and ''Story''. Interviewed in 1957 for the ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Capote was asked about his [[short-story]] technique, answering:
:Since each story presents its own technical problems, obviously one can't generalize about them on a two-times-two-equals-four basis. Finding the right form for your story is simply to realize the most ''natural'' way of telling the story. The test of whether or not a writer has defined the natural shape of his story is just this: After reading it, can you imagine it differently, or does it silence your imagination and seem to you absolute and final? As an orange is final. As an orange is something nature has made just right. 

In 1943 Capote wrote his first novel, ''Summer Crossing'' [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812975932&view=excerpt] about the summer romance of Fifth Avenue socialite Grady O'Neil with a parking lot attendant. Capote later claimed to have destroyed it, and it was regarded as a lost work. However, it was stolen in 1966 by a housesitter Capote hired to watch his [[Brooklyn]] apartment, resurfaced in 2004 and was published by [[Random House]] in [[2005 in literature|2005]].

==''Other Voices, Other Rooms''==
In June 1945, ''Mademoiselle'' published his short story "Miriam" which won an [[O. Henry Award]] (Best First-Published Story) in 1946. In the spring of 1946, Capote was accepted at [[Yaddo]], the 400-acre artists and writers colony at [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. 

"Miriam" attracted the attention of publisher [[Bennett Cerf]], resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of $1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'', continuing to work on the manuscript in [[New Orleans]], Saratoga Springs and [[North Carolina]], eventually completing it in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]]. Capote described the symbolic tale as "a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion." The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote's [[Alabama]] childhood. Decades later, writing in ''The Dogs Bark'' (1973), he looked back:
:''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable.

The story focuses on 13-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from [[New Orleans]] to live with his father who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched [[transvestism|transvestite]] Randolph and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral "queer lady" with "fat dribbling curls" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he was crushed by a piano and near death. He runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the "queer lady" beckoning from the window, is Randolph in his old [[Mardi Gras]] costume. Gerald Clarke, in ''Capote: A Biography'' (1988) described the conclusion:
:Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. "I am me," he whoops. "I am Joel, we are the same people." So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity. 
[[Image:Other.jpg|right|thumb|350px|This much-discussed 1947 Harold Halma photo on the back of ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' (1948) was a key factor in Capote's rise to fame during the 1940s.]]

When ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' was published in 1948, it stayed on the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list for nine weeks, selling more than 26,000 copies. The promotion and controversy surrounding this novel catapulted Capote to fame. A 1947 Harold Halma photograph, used to promote the book, showed a reclining Capote gazing into the camera. Gerald Clarke, in ''Capote: A Biography'' (1988), wrote, "The famous photograph: Harold Halma's picture on the dustjacket of ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' (1948) caused as much comment and controversy as the prose inside. Truman claimed that the camera had caught him off guard, but in fact he had posed himself and was responsible for both the picture and the publicity." Much of the early attention to Capote centered around different interpretations of this photograph, which was viewed as a suggestive pose by some. According to Clarke, the photo created an "uproar" and gave Capote "not only the literary, but also the public personality he had always wanted." The photo made a huge impression on the 20-year-old [[Andy Warhol]], who often talked about the picture and wrote fan letters to Capote. [http://www.warholstars.org/warhol1/2trumancapote.html] When Warhol moved to New York in 1949, he made numerous attempts to meet Capote, and Warhol's fascination with the author led to his first New York one-man show, ''Fifteen Drawings Based on the Writings of Truman Capote'' at the Hugo Gallery (June 16 - July 3, 1952.). 
[[Image:Truman Capote 1924 1.jpg|thumb|left|Capote photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1948]]
When the picture was reprinted along with reviews in magazines and newspapers, some readers were amused, but others were outraged and offended. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Capote looked "as if he were dreamily contemplating some outrage against conventional morality." The novelist [[Merle Miller]] issued a complaint about the picture at a publishing forum, and the photo of "Truman Remote" was satirized in the third issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (making Capote one of the first four celebrities to be spoofed in ''Mad''). The humorist [[Max Shulman]] struck an identical pose for the dustjacket photo on his collection, ''Max Shulman's Large Economy Size'' (1948). Random House featured the Halma photo in their "This is Truman Capote" ads, and large blowups were displayed in bookstore windows. Walking on Fifth Avenue, Halma overheard two middle-aged women looking at a Capote blowup in the window of a bookstore. When one woman said, "I'm telling you: he's just young," the other woman responded, "And I'm telling you, if he isn't young, he's dangerous!" Capote delighted in retelling this anecdote.

Random House followed the success of ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' with ''A Tree of Night and Other Stories'' in 1949. In addition to "Miriam," this collection also includes "Shut a Final Door." First published in ''The Atlantic Monthly'' (August, 1947), "Shut a Final Door" won an O. Henry Award (First Prize) in 1948.

After ''A Tree of Night'' was published, Capote traveled about [[Europe]], he went into a state of depression, including a two-year sojourn in [[Sicily]]. This led to a collection of his European travel 'essays, ''Local Color'' (1950), indicative of his increasing interest in writing nonfiction. In the early 1950s, Capote took on Broadway and films, adapting his 1951 novella, ''The Grass Harp,'' into a 1952 play (later a 1971 musical and a 1995 film), followed by the musical ''[[House of Flowers (musical)|House of Flowers]]'' (1954). Capote co-wrote with [[John Huston]] the screenplay for Huston's film ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953). Traveling through the [[Soviet Union]] with a touring production of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', he produced a series of articles for ''The New Yorker'' that became his first book-length work of nonfiction, ''The Muses Are Heard'' (1956).

== Friendship with Harper Lee ==
Capote was a lifelong friend of his [[Monroeville, Alabama|Monroeville]] neighbor [[Harper Lee]], and he based the character of Idabel in ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' on her. He in turn was the inspiration for the character Dill Harris in Lee's 1960 bestseller ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]].'' In an interview with Lawrence Grobel, Capote recalled his childhood, "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. Harper Lee was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, ''To Kill a Mockingbird''? I'm a character in that book, which takes place in the same small town in Alabama where we both lived."

It was rumored that Capote had written portions of her novel; some said he [[ghostwriter|ghosted]] the entire novel. At least one person<U+2014>Pearl Kazin Bell, an editor at ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''<U+2014>believed the rumor was true, though a [[July 9]] [[1959]], letter from Capote to his aunt indicates that Harper Lee did indeed write the entire book herself,[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5244492] and most literary experts accept Lee's authorship.

== ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' ==
[[Image:Breakfastat.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]
''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's: A Short Novel and Three Stories]]'' brought together the title novella and three shorter tales: "House of Flowers," "A Diamond Guitar" and "A Christmas Memory." The heroine of ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', Holly Golightly, became one of Capote's best-known creations, and the book's prose style prompted Norman Mailer to call Capote "the most perfect writer of my generation." A first edition of this book might sell for between $500 to more than $3000, depending upon condition. 

For Capote, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was a turning point, as he explained to Roy Newquist (''Counterpoint'', 1964):
:I think I've had two careers. One was the career of precocity, the young person who published a series of books that were really quite remarkable. I can even read them now and evaluate them favorably, as though they were the work of a stranger... My second career began, I guess it really began with ''Breakfast at Tiffany's''. It involves a different point of view, a different prose style to some degree. Actually, the prose style is an evolvement from one to the other<U+2014>a pruning and thinning-out to a more subdued, clearer prose. I don't find it as evocative, in many respects, as the other, or even as original, but it is more difficult to do. But I'm nowhere near reaching what I want to do, where I want to go. Presumably this new book is as close as I'm going to get, at least stylistically.

==''In Cold Blood''==
The "new book," ''[[In Cold Blood (book)|In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences]]'', was inspired by a 300-word article that ran on page 19 of ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' on Monday, [[November 16]], [[1959]]. The story described the unexplained murder of the [[Herbert Clutter|Clutter family]] in rural [[Holcomb, Kansas]].

<!-- verbatim quote from primary source - please do not modify -->
:'''Wealthy Farmer, 3 of Family Slain'''

:A wealthy wheat farmer, his wife and their two young children were found shot to death today in their home. They had been killed by shotgun blasts at close range after being bound and gagged. The father, 48-year-old Herbert W. Clutter, was found in the basement with his son, Kenyon, 15. His wife Bonnie, 45, and a daughter, Nancy, 16, were in their beds. There were no signs of a struggle and nothing had been stolen. The telephone lines had been cut. "This is apparently the case of a psychopathic killer," [[Sheriff]] Earl Robinson said. Mr. Clutter was founder of The Kansas Wheat Growers Association. In 1954, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] appointed him to the [[Farm Credit Administration]], but he never lived in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]... The Clutter farm and ranch cover almost 1,000 acres<ref>1000 acres is about 400 hectares or 4 km<U+00B2></ref> in one of the richest wheat areas. Mr. Clutter, his wife and daughter were clad in pajamas. The boy was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. The bodies were discovered by two of Nancy's classmates, Susan Kidwell and Nancy Ewalt... Two daughters were away. They are Beverly, a student at Kansas University, and Mrs. Donald G. Jarchow of Mount Carroll, Ill.

Fascinated by this brief news item, Capote traveled with Harper Lee to Holcomb and visited the scene of the massacre. Over the course of the next few years, he became acquainted with everyone involved in the investigation and most of the residents of the small town. Rather than taking notes during interviews, Capote committed conversations to memory and immediately wrote quotes as soon as an interview ended. He claimed his memory retention for verbatim conversations had been tested at 94%. Lee lent Capote considerable assistance during his research for ''In Cold Blood''. During the first few months of his investigation, she was able to make inroads into the community by befriending the wives of those Capote wanted to interview. Capote recalled his years in Kansas when he spoke at the 1974 San Francisco Film Festival:
:I spent four years on and off in that part of Western Kansas there during the research for that book and then the film. What was it like? It was very lonely. And difficult. Although I made a lot of friends there. I had to, otherwise I never could have researched the book properly. The reason was I wanted to make an experiment in journalistic writing, and I was looking for a subject that would have sufficient proportions. I<U+2019>d already done a great deal of narrative journalistic writing in this experimental vein in the 1950s for ''The New Yorker''... But I was looking for something very special that would give me a lot of scope. I had come up with two or three different subjects and each of them for whatever reasons was a dry run after I<U+2019>d done a lot of work on them. And one day I was gleaning ''The New York Times'', and way on the back page I saw this very small item. And it just said, "Kansas Farmer Slain. Family of Four Is Slain in Kansas." A little item just about like that. And the community was completely nonplussed, and it was this total mystery of how it could have been, and what happened. And I don't know what it was. I think it was that I knew nothing about Kansas or that part of the country or anything. And I thought, "Well, that will be a fresh perspective for me"... And I said, "Well, I<U+2019>m just going to go out there and just look around and see what this is." And so maybe this is the subject I<U+2019>ve been looking for. Maybe a crime of this kind is... in a small town. It has no publicity around it and yet had some strange ordinariness about it. So I went out there, and I arrived just two days after the Clutters<U+2019> funeral. The whole thing was a complete mystery and was for two and a half months. Nothing happened. I stayed there and kept researching it and researching it and got very friendly with the various authorities and the detectives on the case. But I never knew whether it was going to be interesting or not. You know, I mean anything could have happened. They could have never caught the killers. Or if they had caught the killers... it may have turned out to be something completely uninteresting to me. Or maybe they would never have spoken to me or wanted to cooperate with me. But as it so happened, they did catch them. In January, the case was solved, and then I made very close contact with these two boys and saw them very often over the next four years until they were executed. But I never knew... when I was even halfway through the book, when I had been working on it for a year and a half, I didn't honestly know whether I would go on with it or not, whether it would finally evolve itself into something that would be worth all that effort. Because it was a tremendous effort.<ref>[http://history.sffs.org/great_moments/great_moments.php?id=15 San Francisco Film Festival: Great Moments (1974)]</ref>

''In Cold Blood'' was serialized in ''The New Yorker'' in 1965 and published in hardcover by Random House in 1966. The "non-fiction novel," as Capote labeled it, brought him literary acclaim and became an international bestseller. A feud between Capote and British arts critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] erupted in the pages of ''The Observer'' after Tynan's review of ''In Cold Blood'' implied that Capote wanted an execution so the book would have an effective ending. Tynan wrote:
:We are talking, in the long run, about responsibility; the debt that a writer arguably owes to those who provide him<U+2014>down to the last autobiographical parentheses<U+2014>with his subject matter and his livelihood... For the first time an influential writer of the front rank has been placed in a position of privileged intimacy with criminals about to die, and<U+2014>in my view<U+2014>done less than he might have to save them. The focus narrows sharply down on priorities: does the work come first, or does life? An attempt to help (by supplying new psychiatric testimony) might easily have failed: what one misses is any sign that it was ever contemplated.

''In Cold Blood'' brought Capote much praise from the literary community, but there were some who questioned certain events as reported in the book. Writing in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in 1966, Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies after he traveled to Kansas and talked to some of the same people interviewed by Capote. In a telephone interview with Tompkins, Mrs. Meier denied that she heard [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry]] cry and that she held his hand as described by Capote. ''In Cold Blood'' indicates that Meier and Perry became close, yet she told Tompkins she spent little time with Perry and did not talk much with him. Tompkins concluded:
:Capote has, in short, achieved a work of art. He has told exceedingly well a tale of high terror in his own way.  But, despite the brilliance of his self-publicizing efforts, he has made both a tactical and a moral error that will hurt him in the short run. By insisting that <U+201C>every word<U+201D> of his book is true he has made himself vulnerable to those readers who are prepared to examine seriously such a sweeping claim.

True crime writer [[Jack Olsen]] also commented on the fabrications:
:"I recognized it as a work of art, but I know fakery when I see it," Olsen says. "Capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes... The book made something like $6 million in 1960s money, and nobody wanted to discuss anything wrong with a money-maker like that in the publishing business." Nobody except Olsen and a few others. His criticisms were quoted in ''Esquire'', to which Capote replied, "Jack Olsen is just jealous." 

:"That was true, of course," Olsen says, "I was jealous--all that money? I'd been assigned the Clutter case by Harper & Row until we found out that Capote and his cousin, Harper Lee, had been already on the case in Dodge City for six months." Olsen explains, "That book did two things. It made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down. I blew the whistle in my own weak way. I'd only published a couple of books at that time--but since it was such a superbly written book, nobody wanted to hear about it." <ref>[http://www.jackolsen.com/point.htm Hood, Michael. "True Crime Doesn't Pay: A Conversation with Jack Olsen," ''Point No Point'', Winter 1998-99.]</ref>

== Celebrity ==
Capote was 5 feet 4 inches tall (1 metre and 62 centimeters) and openly [[homosexual|gay]] in a time when it was common among artists, but rarely talked about. One of his first serious lovers was [[Smith College]] literature professor [[Newton Arvin]], who won the [[National Book Award]] for his [[Herman Melville]] biography.<ref name=Clarke>{{cite book

Capote was well known for his distinctive, high-pitched voice and odd vocal mannerisms, his offbeat manner of dress and his fabrications. He often claimed to know intimately people he had in fact never met, such as [[Greta Garbo]]. He professed to have had numerous liaisons with men thought to be [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], including, he claimed, [[Errol Flynn]]. He traveled in eclectic circles, hobnobbing with authors, critics, business tycoons, [[philanthropy|philanthropists]], Hollywood and theatrical celebrities, royalty, and members of [[high society]], both in the U.S. and abroad. Part of his public persona was a long-standing rivalry with writer [[Gore Vidal]] ("Truman Capote has tried, with some success, to get into a world that I have tried, with some success, to get out of.").<ref name="vidal">{{cite book|author=Gore Vidal|title=Palimpsest|publisher=Random House, New York (1995) ISNB 0-679-44038-0}}</ref> Apart from his favorite authors ([[Willa Cather]], [[Karen Blixen|Isak Dinesen]]), Capote had faint praise for other writers. However, one who did get his favorable endorsement was journalist [[Lacey Fosburgh]], author of ''[[Closing Time: The True Story of the Goodbar Murder]]'' (1977). He also claimed an admiration for [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B & Back Again]]''.

== Black and White Ball ==
On [[November 28]], [[1966]], in honor of ''[[Washington Post]]'' publisher [[Katharine Graham]], Capote hosted a legendary masked ball, called the Black & White Ball, in the Grand [[Ballroom]] of [[New York City]]'s [[Plaza Hotel]]. It was considered the social event of not only that season but of many to follow. The ''New York Times'' and other publications gave it considerable coverage, and Deborah Davis wrote an entire book about the event, ''Party of the Century'' ([[2006 in literature|2006]]), excerpted by ''The Independent''.<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article360057.ece Davis, Deborah. "The Inside Story of Truman Capote's masked ball," ''The Independent'']</ref> Different accounts of the evening were collected by [[George Plimpton]] in his book ''Truman Capote''.<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1297/plimpton/excerpt.html Plimpton, George. ''Truman Capote, In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career''. Doubleday, 1997.]</ref>

Capote dangled the prized invitations for months, snubbing early supporters like [[Carson McCullers]] as he determined who was "in" and who was "out." In choosing his guest of honor, Capote eschewed glamorous "swans" like [[Babe Paley]] and [[Fiat]] heiress [[Marella Agnelli]] in favor of [[Katharine Graham]]. Actress [[Candice Bergen]] was bored at the ball. Capote's elevator man danced the night away with a woman who didn't know his pedigree. [[Norman Mailer]] sounded off about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Frank Sinatra]] danced with his young wife, [[Mia Farrow]].

==The years following ''In Cold Blood''== 
After the success of ''In Cold Blood'', Capote's publisher re-released his earlier works, including a 20th anniversary edition of ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' and a holiday gift book edition of his 1956 story "A Christmas Memory." A new long story, "The Thanksgiving Visitor," also became a holiday gift book. Now more sought-after than ever, Capote wrote occasional brief articles for magazines, and also  entrenched himself more deeply in the world of the [[jet set]].

In the late 1960s, he became friendly with [[Lee Radziwill]], the sister of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]. Radziwill was an aspiring actress and had appeared to deplorable reviews in an engagement of ''[[The Philadelphia Story]]'' in Chicago. Feeling that the part simply wasn't tailored to her abilities, Capote was commissioned to write the teleplay for a 1967 TV adaptation of the classic [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Laura]]'' starring Radziwill. The adaptation, and Radziwill's performance in particular, received indifferent reviews and poor ratings; arguably, it was Capote's first major professional setback. Radziwill supplanted the older Babe Paley as his primary female companion in public throughout the better part of the 1970s.

Despite the assertion earlier in life that one "lost an IQ point for every year spent on the West Coast," he purchased a home in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and began to indulge in a more aimless lifestyle and heavy drinking. This resulted in bitter quarreling with the more retiring [[Jack Dunphy]] (with whom he had shared a [[Open relationship|non-exclusive relationship]] since the 1950s). Their partnership changed form and continued as a nonsexual one, and they were separated during much of the 1970s. Dunphy was irritated by the unwavering substance abuse and even went so far as to allege that Capote had slept with Radziwill. However, others have alleged that Dunphy, a writer and playwright of far less renown, was unappreciative of Capote's gifts (including a Swiss condominium that Capote had little use for) and financial support. 

In the absence of Dunphy, Capote began to frequent the [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouse]] circuit in New York, often seducing working-class, sexually unsure men half his age. This frequently resulted in socially embarrassing situations; while visiting [[Marella Agnelli]] in Italy, Capote's latest lover<U+2014>an air conditioner repairman<U+2014>asked for a baked potato while dining in an exclusive restaurant. 

The dearth of new writing and other failures, including a rejected screenplay for Paramount's 1974 adaptation of ''The Great Gatsby'', was counteracted by Capote's frequenting of the talk show circuit. There, his candid<U+2014>and sometimes inebriated<U+2014>appearances became the stuff of clich<U+00E9>.

In 1972, with Lee Radziwill in tow, Capote accompanied [[the Rolling Stones]] on their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] as a correspondent for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. While managing to take extensive notes for the project and visit old friends from the ''In Cold Blood'' days in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]],<!-- needs disambiguation --> he feuded with [[Mick Jagger]] and ultimately refused to write the article. The magazine eventually recouped its interests by publishing, in April 1973, an interview of the author conducted by [[Andy Warhol]]. A collection of previously published essays and reportage, ''The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places'', appeared later that year.

In July 1973 Capote met John O'Shea, the middle-aged vice president of a Long Island bank, while visiting a bathhouse. The married father of two did not identify as homosexual or bisexual, perceiving his visits as being a "kind of masturbation". However, O'Shea found Capote's fortune alluring and harbored aspirations to become a professional writer. After consummating their relationship in Palm Springs, the two engaged in an ongoing war of jealousy and manipulation for the remainder of the decade. Longtime friends were appalled when O'Shea, who was officially employed as Capote's manager, attempted to take total control of the author's literary and business interests.

== ''Answered Prayers'' ==
Through his jet-set social life Capote had been discreetly conducting research (unbeknownst to his friends and benefactors) for his tell-all ''Answered Prayers'' (eventually to be published as ''[[Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel]]''). The book, which had been in the planning stages since 1958, was intended to be the American equivalent of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]'' and a culmination of the "nonfiction novel" format. Initially scheduled for publication in 1968, the novel was eventually delayed at Capote's insistence to 1972. Because of the delay, he was forced to return money received for the film rights to [[20th Century Fox]]. Capote spoke about the novel in interviews, but continued to delay the delivery date.

By 1975, public demand for ''Answered Prayers'' had reached a critical mass, with many speculating that Capote had not even written a single word of the book. He permitted ''Esquire'' to publish four chapters of the unfinished novel in 1975 and 1976. The first to appear, "Mojave", ran as a self-contained short story and was favorably received, but the second, "''La C<U+00F4>te Basque'' 1965", based in part on the dysfunctional personal lives of [[William S. Paley]] and [[Babe Paley]], arguably Capote's best friends, generated controversy. Although the issue featuring "''La C<U+00F4>te Basque''" sold out immediately upon publication, its much-discussed betrayal of confidences alienated Capote from his established base of middle aged, wealthy female friends, who feared that the intimate and often sordid details of their ostensibly glamorous lives would be exposed to the public. Another two chapters, "Unspoiled Monsters" and "Kate McCloud", appeared subsequently; intended to form the long opening section of the novel, they displayed a marked shift in narrative voice, introduced a more elaborate plot structure, and together formed a novella-length mosaic of fictionalized memoir and gossip. "Unspoiled Monsters", which by itself was almost as long as ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', contained a thinly veiled satire of [[Tennessee Williams]], whose friendship with Capote had already become strained.

==Later years==
[[Image:Mmchameleons.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Music for Chameleons]]'', the last work of Capote published during his lifetime.]]
In the late 1970s, Capote was in and out of rehab clinics, and news of his various breakdowns frequently reached the public. In 1978, talk show host Stanley Siegal did a live on-air interview with Capote, who, in an extraordinarily intoxicated state, confessed that he might kill himself. One year later, when he felt betrayed by Lee Radziwill in a feud with perpetual nemesis Gore Vidal, Capote arranged a return visit to Stanley Siegal's show, this time to deliver a bizarrely comic performance revealing salacious personal details about Radziwill and her sister, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

In an ironic twist, Warhol (who had made a point of seeking out Capote when he first arrived in New York) provided the author with the platform for his next artistic renewal. Warhol, who often partied with Capote at [[Studio 54]], agreed to paint Capote's portrait as "a personal gift"<U+2014>rather than for the six-figure sums he usually charged<U+2014>in exchange for Capote contributing short pieces to Warhol's ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine every month for a year. Initially the pieces were to consist of tape-recorded conversations, but soon Capote dispensed with the tape recorder and chose instead to craft meticulously composed "conversational portraits" that applied his literary skills to the magazine's dialogue-driven format. Out of this creative burst came the pieces that would form the basis for the bestselling ''[[Music for Chameleons]]'' (1980). To celebrate this unexpected renaissance, he underwent a [[facelift]], lost weight and experimented with hair transplants. Nevertheless, Capote was unable to overcome his reliance upon drugs and liquor and had grown bored with New York by the turn of the 1980s.

After the revocation of his driver's license (the result of speeding near his [[Long Island]] residence) and a hallucinatory seizure in 1980 that required hospitalization, Capote became fairly reclusive. These hallucinations continued unabated and scans revealed that his brain mass had perceptibly shrunk. On the rare occasions when he was lucid, he continued to hype ''Answered Prayers'' as being nearly complete and was reportedly planning a reprise of the Black and White Ball to have been held either in Los Angeles or a more exotic locale in South America. On a few occasions, he was still able to write. In 1982, a new short story, "One Christmas", appeared in the December issue of ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' and the following year it became, like its predecessors "A Christmas Memory" and "The Thanksgiving Visitor", a holiday gift book. In 1983, "Remembering Tennessee", an essay in tribute to [[Tennessee Williams]], who had died in February of that year, appeared in [[Playboy]] magazine.

==Death==
Capote died in [[Los Angeles]] on [[August 25]], [[1984]], aged 59. <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Truman Capote is Dead at 59; Novelist of Style and Clarity. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0930.html |quote=Truman Capote, one of the postwar era's leading American writers, whose prose shimmered with clarity and quality, died yesterday in Los Angeles at the age of 59. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}</ref>

According to the coroner's report the cause of death was "liver disease complicated by [[phlebitis]] and multiple drug intoxication."  He passed away at the home of his old friend Joanne Carson, ex-wife of late-night TV host [[Johnny Carson]], on whose program Capote had been a frequent guest. He was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, leaving behind his longtime companion, author [[Jack Dunphy]]. Dunphy died in 1992, and in 1994 both his and Capote's ashes were scattered at Crooked Pond, between [[Bridgehampton]] and [[Sag Harbor]] on [[Long Island]], close to where the two had maintained a property with individual houses for many years. Capote also maintained the property in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], a condominium in [[Switzerland]] that was mostly occupied by Dunphy seasonally, and a primary residence at the [[United Nations]] Plaza in New York City.

Capote twice won the [[O. Henry Awards|O. Henry Memorial Short Story Prize]] and was a member of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]].

==Capote in TV, film and theater== 
Capote's childhood experiences are captured in the 1956 memoir "A Christmas Memory," which he adapted for television and narrated. Directed by [[Frank Perry]], it aired on [[December 21]], [[1966]], on ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'', and featured [[Geraldine Page]] in an [[Emmy Award]]-winning performance.  The teleplay was later incorporated into Perry's 1969 anthology film ''Trilogy'' (aka ''Truman Capote's Trilogy''), which also includes adaptations of "Miriam" and "Among the Paths to Eden." The TV movie ''Truman Capote's A Christmas Memory'', with [[Patty Duke]] and [[Piper Laurie]], was a [[1997 in television|1997]] remake, directed by Glenn Jordan.

In [[1961 in film|1961]] Capote's novel ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' about a flamboyant New York party girl named Holly Golightly was filmed by director [[Blake Edwards]] and starred [[Audrey Hepburn]] in what many consider her defining role, though Capote never approved of the toning down of the story to appeal to mass audiences.

Capote narrated his ''The Thanksgiving Visitor'' (1967), a sequel to ''A Christmas Memory'', filmed by Frank Perry in [[Pike Road, Alabama]]. Geraldine Page again won an Emmy for her performance in this hour-long [[teleplay]].

''In Cold Blood'' was filmed twice. When [[Richard Brooks]] directed ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', the [[1967 in film|1967]] adaptation with [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and [[Scott Wilson]], he filmed at the actual Clutter house and other Holcomb, Kansas, locations. [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[Eric Roberts]] headed the cast of the 1996 ''In Cold Blood'' miniseries, directed by [[Jonathan Kaplan]].

[[Neil Simon]]'s 1976 murder mystery spoof ''[[Murder by Death]]'' provided Capote's main role as an actor, portraying reclusive millionaire Lionel Twain who invites the world's leading detectives together to a dinner party to have them solve a murder. The performance brought him a [[Golden Globe]] nomination (Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture). Early in the film it is alleged that Twain has ten fingers but no pinkies. In truth, Capote's pinkie fingers were unusually large. In the film, Capote's character is highly critical of the detective fiction of the like of [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Dashiell Hammett]].

In [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), there is a scene in which Alvy (Allen) and Annie ([[Diane Keaton]]) are observing passersby in the park. Alvy comments, "Oh, there goes the winner of the Truman Capote Look-Alike Contest." The passerby is actually Truman Capote (who appeared in the film uncredited). 

''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' came to theater screens in 1995 with David Speck in the lead role of Joel Sansom. Reviewing this atmospheric [[Southern Gothic]] film in the ''New York Times'', [[Stephen Holden]] wrote:
:One of the things the movie does best is transport you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.

Capote's short story "Children on Their Birthdays", another look back at a small-town Alabama childhood, was brought to film by director Mark Medoff in [[2002 in film|2002]].

''With Love from Truman'' ([[1966 in television|1966]]), a 29-minute documentary by David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, shows a ''Newsweek'' reporter interviewing Capote at his beachfront home in Long Island. Capote talks about ''In Cold Blood'', his relationship with the murderers and his coverage of the trial. He is also seen taking Alvin Dewey and his wife around New York City for the first time. Originally titled ''A Visit with Truman Capote'', this film was commissioned by National Educational Television and shown on the NET network.

In 1990, [[Robert Morse]] received both a [[Tony Award|Tony]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his portrayal of Capote in the one-man show, ''[[Tru (play)|Tru]]''. In 1992, he recreated the performance for the PBS series ''[[American Playhouse]]'' and won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance.

[[Paul Williams]] appears as Capote in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991) introducing [[Jim Morrison]] to [[Andy Warhol]].

Louis Negrin portrayed Capote in ''54'' (1998). A reference is made to Capote as just having had a face lift, and the song "Knock on Wood" is dedicated to him.

Sam Street is seen briefly as Capote in ''Isn't She Great?'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]), a biographical comedy-drama about [[Jacqueline Susann]]. Michael J. Burg has appeared as Capote in two films, ''The Audrey Hepburn Story'' (2000) and ''The Hoax'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]), about [[Clifford Irving]].

''Truman Capote: The Tiny Terror'' is a documentary that aired [[April 6]], [[2004 in television|2004]], as part of A&E's ''[[A&E Biography|Biography]]'' series, followed by a 2005 DVD release.

In July [[2005 in literature|2005]], [[Oni Press]] published comic book artist and writer Ande Parks' ''Capote in Kansas: A Drawn Novel'', a fictionalized account of Capote and Lee researching ''In Cold Blood''.

Director [[Bennett Miller]] made his dramatic feature debut with the [[biopic]] ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]). Spanning the years Truman Capote spent researching and writing ''In Cold Blood'', the film depicts Capote's conflict between his compassion for his subjects and self-absorbed obsession with finishing the book. ''Capote'' garnered much critical acclaim when it was released ([[September 30]], [[2005]] in the US and [[February 24]], [[2006]] in the UK). [[Dan Futterman]]'s screenplay was based on the book ''Capote: A Biography'' by Gerald Clarke. ''Capote'' received five [[Academy Award]] nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]'s performance earned him many awards, including a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award, a [[Golden Globe]], a [[Screen Actors Guild]] Award, an [[Independent Spirit Award]] and the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role]].

''[[Infamous (film)|Infamous]]'' (2006), which stars [[Toby Jones]] as Capote and [[Sandra Bullock]] as Harper Lee, is an adaptation of [[George Plimpton]]'s ''Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career'' ([[1997 in literature|1997]]). Writer-director Douglas McGrath offered a contrast of Capote in Kansas with his gossipy adventures amid the New York social set. The film's premiere at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in August 2006 was followed by a October 13 theatrical release. Reviewing in ''[[The Independent]]'', prior to the premiere, critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote:
:The best new film I've seen this year is about the writer Truman Capote... I have no reason to attack ''Capote'', or diminish it. I thought it was a good picture. But this is better... So get ready for ''Infamous'' - unless someone has the wit to find a new title. Understand in advance that the leading arbiters of culture will tell you it's the same thing warmed up, a story you know, a curiosity even. It's none of those. We do not write off this year's ''Hamlet'' because we enjoyed last year's. We might listen to Mahler's ''Ninth'' tonight and in a few months' time. You do not really know this story in advance, for a very good reason: you have not been moved by it yet. You have been intrigued, entertained - all good things. In ''Infamous'', among other things, you have [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s breakdown and the fact that one of the killers took 30 minutes to die after he had been hanged. People collapse slowly. You will be surprised. [http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/features/article1096307.ece]

More than 70 film critics wrote favorable reviews of ''Infamous'', but some were not impressed. Jim Emerson, reviewing in ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'', wrote:
:''Infamous'' never finds its proper tone, which should have been set by the peacock performances of Jones and Stevenson -- flaming creatures who are comically flamboyant, self-possessed and just enough over the top to be dazzling. As Capote's fellow author and investigative collaborator [[Nelle Harper Lee]], Sandra Bullock is robotic. When she shifts her eyes at a key moment in a scene, you can almost read the programming code that dictates the maneuver. In the end, ''Infamous'' turns out to be the third-best movie built around the murders of the Clutter family of Holcomb, Kan., in 1959.<ref>Emerson, Jim. "Infamous Capote Story Better Told Elsewhere," ''Chicago Sun-Times'' (October 13, 2006).</ref>

Due to the numerous depictions of Capote on film, the satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published a 2006 article: "Oscars Create New Truman Capote Biopic Category."<ref>[http://www.theonion.com/content/node/54569 ''The Onion'', "Oscars Create New Truman Capote Biopic Category"]</ref>

In 1994, actor and writer Bob Kingdom created the one-man theatre piece ''The Truman Capote Talk Show'', in which he played Capote looking back over his life. Originally performed at the [[Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith|Lyric Studio Theatre, Hammersmith, London]], the piece has proved very successful and has toured widely within the UK and internationally.

In the [[Charles Bukowski]] Poem "Nothing but a Scarf", Capote is referred to as an 'ice-skater-of-a-writer'. Bukowski goes on to write about how his fast life eventually led to his down fall and how 'he never had his nose rubbed into life'.
