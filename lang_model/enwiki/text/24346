A '''rogues gallery''' (or '''rogues' gallery''') is a [[police]] collection of pictures or [[photograph]]s of [[crime|criminal]]s and [[suspect]]s kept for identification purposes. The term is also used figuratively by extension for any group of shady characters or the line-up of 'mugshot' photographs that might be displayed in the halls of a dormitory or workplace.

==History==

In 1857, [[Allan Pinkerton]] founded the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]]. Pinkerton devised the ''[[Rogue]]s<U+2019> Gallery'' {{Fact|date=November 2007}} &mdash; a compilation of descriptions, methods of operation, hiding places, and names of criminals and their associates.  

Inspector [[Thomas F. Byrnes|Thomas Byrnes]] of the late-19th-century [[New York City Police Department]] popularized the term with his collection of photographs of known criminals, which was used for witness identification. Byrnes published some of these photos with details of the criminals in ''Professional Criminals of America'' (1886).<ref>Byrnes, Thomas. ''Professional Criminals of America'' (1886) ISBN 1-5857411-3-2</ref>

==In fiction==
The expression "rogues gallery" has also been used in [[fiction]], most commonly in [[comics]] as well as in [[movies]] and [[television]]. It is believed to have started with the group known as the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a team-up of colorful villains that opposed the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. Through its continued appearance in stories of other superheroes such as [[Batman]] and [[Spider-Man]] it became common parlance to call an assortment of enemies that oppose a certain fictional hero a rogues gallery.
