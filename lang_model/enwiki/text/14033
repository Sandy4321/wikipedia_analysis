'''P<U+00E1>vel Dim<U+00ED>trievich Turchan<U+00ED>nov''' (died September 21, 1921), known by the pseudonym '''Lev Chernyi''', was a [[Russia]]n [[anarchist]] theorist, activist and poet, and a leading figure of the [[Third Russian Revolution]].<ref name=match>{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Terry |year=1984 |month=Fall |journal=[[The Match!]] |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |issue=79 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |title=Lev Chernyi }}</ref> His early thought was [[individualist anarchism|individualist]], rejecting [[anarcho-communism]] as a threat to individual liberty. In 1917, Chernyi was released from his [[political prisoner|political imprisonment]] by the [[Imperial Russia]]n regime, and swiftly became one of the leading figures in [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchism]]. After strongly denouncing the new [[Bolshevik]] government in various anarchist publications and joining several underground resistance movements, Chernyi was arrested by the [[Cheka]] on a charge of [[counterfeiting]] and in 1921 was executed without trial.

==Early life, philosophy and imprisonment==
Chernyi was born P<U+00E1>vel Dim<U+00ED>trievich Turchan<U+00ED>nov to an army [[colonel]] father.<ref name=Avrich180>{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=180}}</ref> A "d<U+00E9>class<U+00E9> intellectual" whom anarchist historian [[Paul Avrich]] compares with [[Volin]], Chernyi advocated a [[Nietzschean]] [[transvaluation of values|overthrow of the values]] of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary [[Mir (social)|communes]] of [[anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] as a threat to the freedom of the individual.<ref name=Avrich180/><ref>{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=254}}</ref><ref name=aa/> Chernyi advocated the "free association of independent individuals" in a book titled ''Associational Anarchism'' and published in 1907.<ref name=aa>{{cite book |last=Chernyi |first=Lev |title=Novoe Napravlenie v Anarkhizme: Asosiatsionnii Anarkhism |origyear=1907 |edition=Moscow; 2nd |year=1923 |publisher=New York }}</ref> Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Max Stirner]], and [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref name=sub/> Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in [[Siberia]] under the Russian [[Czar]]ist regime for his revolutionary activities.<ref name=match/>

==Return to Moscow and opposition to the Bolsheviks==
On his return from Siberia in 1917, Chernyi enjoyed great popularity among [[Moscow]] workers as a [[lecturer]], and was at this time one of Russia's leading individualist anarchists<ref name=Avrich180/> and one of anarchism's main ideologues.<ref name=cooke>{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |coauthors=Leach, Neil (ed.) |chapter=Alexei Gan and the Moscow Anarchists |title=Architecture and Revolution |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0415139147 |pages=25<U+2013>37 }}</ref> He was the [[Secretary]] and leading theorist of the [[Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups]], which was formed in March 1917 after the abdication of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and was primarily concerned with disseminating [[propaganda]] to Moscow's poorer classes.<ref name=Avrich180/><ref name=sub>{{cite journal |last=Antliff |first=Allan |year=2007 |title=Anarchy, Power, and Poststructuralism |journal=SubStance |volume=36 |issue=113 |pages=56<U+2013>66 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/substance/v036/36.2antliff.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-10 |doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0026}}</ref>

A personal acquaintance of [[Lev Kamenev]] and other leading [[Bolsheviks]], Chernyi denounced the nascent [[Soviet Union]] at a rally on March 5, 1918, declaring that for anarchists, the socialist state was as much an enemy as its bourgeois predecessor and promising to "paralyze the governmental mechanism".<ref name=cooke/> A vociferous advocate of seizing private homes,<ref name=Avrich180/> Chernyi agitated against the state in the pages of ''[[Anarkhiia]]'', the anarchist weekly newspaper, proposing increasingly detailed means of decentralized production and "complete absence of internal power structures".<ref name=cooke/> In the Spring of 1918, the anarchist groups within the Moscow Federation, formed armed detachments in reaction to the growing repression of all resistance and free expression.<ref name=match/> These were the [[Black Guards]], precursors to the anarchist [[The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] which fought the Bolsheviks in the [[Russian Civil War]]. On the night of April 11, the [[Cheka]] (Soviet [[secret police]]) raided a building occupied by the Moscow Federation, with the official aim of arresting and charging "robber bands" in the anarchist ranks.<ref name=sub/> They were met with armed resistance by the Black Guards and in the ensuing battle, approximately forty anarchists were killed or wounded and about five hundred were imprisoned.<ref name=match/>

==Arrest and execution==
[[Image:Bucharin.bra.jpg|thumb|right|Eminent Bolshevik [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who was wounded in the anarchist attack on the Moscow Communist Party headquarters for which Chernyi was framed and shot without trial.]]
Having helped establish an underground group in 1918, Chernyi joined another group called the [[Underground Anarchists]] the following year.<ref name=Avrich188>{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=188}}</ref> The organization, which had been founded by Kazimir Kovalevich and Piotr Sobalev, published two issues of an incendiary [[broadsheet]] denouncing the [[Communist]] [[dictatorship]] as the worst [[tyranny]] in human history.<ref name=match/> On September 25, 1919, together with a number of leftist social revolutionaries, the Underground Anarchists bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] during a [[plenary meeting]]. Twelve Communists were killed and fifty-five others were wounded, including eminent Bolshevik theorist and ''[[Pravda]]'' editor [[Nikolai Bukharin]].<ref name=Avrich188/> Chernyi was detained along with [[Fanya Baron]] on a [[counterfeiting]] charge.<ref>{{cite book |last=Polenberg |first=Richard |title=Fighting Faiths: the Abrams Case, the Supreme Court and Free Speech |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca |year=1999 |isbn=0801486181 |page=350}}</ref> In August 1921, the Moscow ''[[Izvestia]]'' published an official report announcing that ten "anarchist bandits", among them Chernyi, had been shot without hearing or [[trial (law)|trial]]. However, historian of anarchism [[Paul Avrich]] contends that Chernyi was executed in September of that year rather than August.<ref name=match/> Although he was not personally involved in the bombing of the Communist Party headquarters, Chernyi was, because of his association with the Underground Anarchists, a likely candidate for a [[frameup]]. The Communists refused to turn over his body to his family for burial, and rumors persisted that he had in fact died of [[torture]].<ref name=match/>
