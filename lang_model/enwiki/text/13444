'''MediaCityUK''' is a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} mixed-use property development site at [[Salford Quays]] on the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and [[Trafford]], England. The project is being developed by [[The Peel Group|Peel Media]], and its principal tenants are [[Mass media|media]] organisations. The land occupied by the development was part of the [[Port of Manchester]]. 

The BBC signalled its intention to move jobs to Manchester in 2004, and the Salford Quays site was chosen in 2006. The Peel Group was granted planning permission to develop the site in 2007, and construction of the development, with its own energy generation plant and communications network, began the same year. Based in Quay House, the principal tenant will be the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], whose move marks a large-scale [[decentralisation]] from London. [[BBC Children's]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], [[BBC Research]] and [[BBC Sport]] are among the departments scheduled to relocate to the development. [[ITV plc|ITV]]'s [[Granada ITV|Granada]] division plan to move from their [[The Manchester Studios|Granada Studios]] to MediaCityUK in 2012. The Studios on Broadway house seven high-definition studios, claimed to be the largest such facility in Europe.

MediaCityUK is to be developed in two phases. The {{convert|36|acre|adj=on}} first phase was completed in 2011, and the second is dependent on its success. The [[Manchester Metrolink]] was extended to MediaCityUK with the opening of the [[MediaCityUK Metrolink station]] on 20 September 2010,<ref name="MEN-opening">{{citation |title=Metrolink trams pull in to MediaCityUK station for first time |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/transport/public_transport/s/1328314_metrolink_trams_pull_in_to_mediacityuk_station_for_first_time |accessdate=25&nbsp;September 2010 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=20&nbsp;September 2010}}</ref> and further extensions are planned. Road access was improved by the construction of Broadway Link Road.

==Background==
[[File:Media City Cranes.jpg|thumb|right|Construction activity, December 2008]]
In 2003 reports emerged that, as part of the plans for the renewal of its [[Royal Charter]], the BBC was considering moving whole channels or strands of production from London to Manchester.<ref>{{citation |title=BBC may switch channel to North |newspaper=The Times |date=21 November 2003 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0FEFBBA2CBFCA10E&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |format={{subscription or membership required}} |accessdate=7 October 2011|location=London|first=Raymond|last=Snoddy}}</ref>  Early discussions involved a plan where the BBC would move to a new media village proposed by [[Granada Television]] at its Bonded Warehouse site.<ref>{{citation |title=ITV fears for shared Manchester studios |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/may/10/broadcasting.bbc?INTCMP=SRCH |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Brown|first=Maggie|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Granada moving, but only next door |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/73/73449_granada_moving_but_only_next_door.html |date=19 November 2003 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |first=David |last=Ottewell|work=Manchester Evening News}}</ref>

Proposals to relocate 1800 jobs to Manchester were unveiled by [[BBC Director General]], [[Mark Thompson]], in December 2004.  The BBC justified the move as its spending per head was low in Manchester, it had low approval ratings in the north and its facilities at [[New Broadcasting House]] needed replacing.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4072649.stm|title=BBC  plans for Manchester move |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=6 October 2011 |last=Breen|first=Rozina|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Thompson says BBC 'must keep up' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4077355.stm |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=7 October 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref>   An initial list of 18 sites was narrowed to a short-list of four during 2005, two in Manchester <U+2013> one at Quay Street, close to Granada Studios, and one on Whitworth Street and two in Salford <U+2013> one close to the [[MEN Arena]] and one at Pier 9 on Salford Quays.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/oct/22/broadcasting.bbc?INTCMP=SRCH |date=22 October 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |title= BBC a step closer to Manchester move |newspaper=The Guardian|last=Gibson|first=Owen|location=London}}</ref>  The site at Salford Quays was chosen in June 2006  and the move north was conditional on a satisfactory [[Television licence|licence fee]] settlement from the government.<ref>{{citation |title=BBC: It's Salford!

The chosen site was the last undeveloped site at Manchester Docks, an area that had been subject to considerable investment and was emerging as a tourist destination, residential and commercial centre.  The vision of the developers [[Peel Group]], [[Salford City Council]], the Central Salford Urban Regeneration Company and the [[Northwest Regional Development Agency]] was to create a significant new media city capable of competing on a global scale with developments in Copenhagen and Singapore.<ref name = "planning guide"/>

The opening [[Swing bridge|swing footbridge]] at Salford Quays links MediaCityUK with Trafford Wharf on the southern bank of the ship canal. It was designed by Wilkinson Eyre in association with [[Gifford (company)|Gifford]]. The bridge's main span is {{convert|213|ft}} when open and provides a {{convert|157|ft|adj=on}} wide navigation channel accommodating ships' superstructures up to {{convert|66|ft}} in height. The developers specified it to be <U+201C>a unique and memorable landmark<U+201D>. Its visibility is created by a curved bridge deck with an offset pivot mast and array of supporting cables in a fan or sail shape. It has seating benches and is lit at night.<ref>{{citation |title= Media City Footbridge |url=http://www.wilkinsoneyre.com/projects/media-city-footbridge.aspx?category=bridges |publisher=Wilkinson Eyre.Architects |accessdate=3&nbsp;October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=MediaCity Footbridge |url=http://www.gifford.uk.com/services/bridge-engineering/project/mediacity-footbridge/ |publisher=Gifford UK |accessdate=6&nbsp;October 2011}}</ref> The bridge, constructed with funding from the Northwest Regional Development Agency, is the final link in a circular walking route connecting the development  with The Lowry and Imperial War Museum North.

The development is powered by a gas-powered [[trigeneration]] energy plant producing electricity for cooling and heating using water from the ship canal. It is more than twice as efficient as conventional grid electricity and helped the development gain [[BREEAM]] sustainable community status.<ref name = "site visit"/> The communications network is one of the most advanced in world, with more than 20&nbsp;million metres of fibre optic cable capable of delivering the internet speeds required for media production.<ref>{{citation |title=Technology |url=http://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/our-community/technology |work=MediaCityUK|access date=9&nbsp;October 2011}}</ref>

The design of buildings at MediacityUK has been criticised by the editor of ''Building Design'' magazine, Ellis Woodman, who describes it as "a crazed accumulation of development in which every aimlessly gesticulating building sports at least three different cladding treatments.
