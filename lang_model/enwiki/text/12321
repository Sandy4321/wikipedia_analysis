The '''Sugar Grove Petroglyphs''' are a group of [[petroglyph]]s in the southwestern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]].  Located on an [[outcrop]] of [[sandstone]] in [[Monongahela Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania|Monongahela Township]] near the eastern edge of [[Greene County, Pennsylvania|Greene County]], the petroglyphs have been known since at least the 1930s.  Due to their value as an [[archaeological site]], the petroglyphs have been named a [[historic site]].

==Creation==
It is certain that the Sugar Grove Petroglyphs are the work of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people, although the [[archaeological culture|cultural affiliation]] of their creators is unknown.  Among the cultures that archaeologists have seen as possible creators are the [[Monongahela culture|Monongahela]] or [[Fort Ancient]], both of which are known to have inhabited the upper portions of the [[Ohio River|Ohio River valley]].<ref name=nomination>Herbstritt, James T.  National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Sugar Grove Petroglyph Site (36GR5).  [[National Park Service]], 1980-07-22.</ref>{{rp|4}}  In his 1974 [[monograph]] ''Rock Art of the Upper Ohio Valley'', petroglyph specialist [[James L. Swauger]] argued for a Monongahela-related and proto-[[Shawnee]] identity of the creators; this conclusion he drew from the presence of carvings that he interpreted as representations of [[Ojibwe]] religious subjects.  Although the Ojibwe never inhabited southwestern Pennsylvania, Swauger believed that the ancestors of the Shawnee shared these subjects as part of a common cultural heritage.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|112}}

==Geology==
The petroglyphs were carved into the flat portion of a large outcrop of [[Dunkard Group|Dunkard]]-series [[sandstone]];<ref name=swauger />{{rp|67}} it rises somewhat more than {{convert|4|ft}} above the ground on its western side, but its other edges are level with the floor of the surrounding woodland.  The petroglyphs are confined to a roughly square area of the stone that measures approximately {{convert|23|ft}} on each side,<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68}} although most appear on the eastern side and center of this area.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68}}

==Carvings==
Forty-eight different carvings are present on the sandstone; although most are Native American artwork, a few have been added by vandals since white settlement of southwestern Pennsylvania.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68}}  Swauger grouped the designs into six categories,<ref name=nomination />{{rp|2}} as follows:<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68-69}}


{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size:100%; margin:auto;"
! Category !! Number of carvings

Identification of the various designs has been complicated by [[erosion]]; some designs, especially those that are clustered closely together, have deteriorated and are thus difficult to classify conclusively.  Among the most difficult are the carvings that were identified as bird tracks; they may have originally been abstract designs or arrowheads.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|69}}  Likewise, many abstract designs may have been created as identifiable designs, with their present conditions being the result of vandalism, later Native American carvings, or erosion.  The most distinctive image on the rock is a large, almost circular animal that appears to be swallowing its tail; due to its unique shape and great size <nowiki>[</nowiki>its diameter is approximately {{convert|5|ft}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>, it has been seen as the most important single petroglyph at the site.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|70}}  It has been claimed that the site was damaged by [[quarry]]ing circa 1950, but the only damage visible in a 1960 survey was small bits of stone that had been chipped away, possibly by vandals attempting to remove individual carvings.<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68}}  A 1982 survey discovered that the site had not changed since the 1960 survey.<ref name=nomination />{{rp|2}}

==Recognition==
Locals have long known the petroglyphs as the "Picture Rocks;"<ref name=nomination />{{rp|2}} its original scholarly recognition was under this name, producing confusion in archaeological records after the site was separately recorded under the name of "Sugar Grove Petroglyphs."<ref name=swauger />{{rp|68}} The first appearance of the Sugar Grove Petroglyphs in scholarly literature was no later than 1931, when they were given a short appearance in an archaeological survey of adjacent [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]].  More detailed surveys in 1934 and 1950 led respectively to the publication of detailed drawings of the designs and to formal recognition as an archaeological site.<ref name=nomination />{{rp|2}}

Finding preservation of the designs to be a priority, the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] arranged for the production of [[plaster cast]]s of the designs during the twentieth century.<ref name=nomination />{{rp|2}}  Sugar Grove has been seen as one of western Pennsylvania's most important petroglyph sites: although it is smaller than many others, its location has spared it from the fate of many waterside petroglyphs that have been submerged by the construction of major dams, and it has suffered less vandalism than many other sites that occupy dry ground.<ref name=nomination />{{rp|4}}

In recognition of its archaeological value, the Sugar Grove Petroglyphs were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.  They are one of four petroglyph sites in Pennsylvania to have received this designation, along with the [[Indian God Rock]] in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]], the [[Francis Farm Petroglyphs]] in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]], and the [[Big and Little Indian Rock Petroglyphs]] in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].<ref name=nris />
