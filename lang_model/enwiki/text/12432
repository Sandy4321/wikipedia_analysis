A '''turnstile''', also called a '''baffle gate''', is a form of [[gate]] which allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to enforce [[One-way traffic#One-way traffic of people|one-way traffic of people]], and in addition, it can restrict passage only to people who insert a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. Thus a turnstile can be used in the case of [[Fare control|paid access]] (sometimes called a '''[[faregate]]''' when used for this purpose), for example [[public transport]] as a ticket barrier or a [[pay toilet]], or to restrict access to authorized people, for example in the lobby of an office building.

Turnstiles are used at a wide variety of settings, including stadiums, amusement parks, museums, mass transit stations, office lobbies, retail sites, cafeterias, temporary exhibits, ski resorts, casinos and souvenir stands.

From a business/revenue standpoint, turnstiles give an accurate, verifiable count of attendance. From a security standpoint, they lead patrons to enter single-file, so security personnel have a clear view of each patron. This enables security to efficiently isolate potential trouble or to confiscate any prohibited materials. They can, on the other hand, become a serious safety issue when a speedy evacuation is needed. 

[[Persons with disabilities]] may have difficulties using turnstiles. In these cases, generally a wide aisle gate or a manual gate may be provided. At some locations where luggage is expected, a line of turnstiles may be entirely formed of wide isle gates, for example at [[Heathrow_Terminals_1,_2,_3_tube_station|Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 Underground station]].

==History and applications==
[[File:Bath Rec, old turnstile.jpg|thumb|A now unused circa 1930 turnstile and kiosk at the [[Bath Recreation Ground]]]]
Turnstiles were originally used, like other forms of [[stile]], to allow human beings to pass while keeping sheep or other livestock penned in. The use of turnstiles in most modern applications has been credited to [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]], who used them in his first [[Piggly Wiggly]] store.

Turnstiles often use [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] mechanisms to allow the rotation of the stile in one direction allowing ingress but preventing rotation in the other direction. They are often designed to operate only after a payment has been made, usually by inserting a [[coin]] or [[token (numismatics)|token]] in a slot; or by swiping, or inserting, a paper ticket or electronically encoded card.

Turnstiles are often used for counting the numbers of people passing through a gate, even where payment is not involved. They are used extensively in this manner in [[amusement park]]s, in order to keep track of how many people enter and exit the park and ride each ride. The first major use of turnstiles at a sporting venue was at [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].

==Types of turnstiles==
===Waist-high===

A modern turnstile for Fairs, Attractions & Arenas. The user inserts a ticket or pass into the slot, from which a barcode is read; if access is to be granted, a sensor determines the speed with which the user passes through, and sets the electric motor to turn the turnstile at the corresponding speed.
Sometimes also referred to as "half-height" turnstiles, this fixed arm style has traditionally been the most popular type of turnstile. There are many variations of this style available, including one which is designed to be accompanied by a matching ticket box, and one with a ticket box built in. Some styles are designed to allow entry only after a payment (actual coins and tokens) are inserted,<ref> [http://books.google.com/books?id=oiEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116&dq=popular+science+1930&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dsv2TtD8G83qggfXlYCwAg&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCDhu#v=onepage&q&f=true "How a Subway Turnstile Works"] ''Popular Science'', April 1952, pp. 116-117.</ref> while others allow access after a valid barcode is electronically read.
A disadvantage to this type is people can "jump the turnstile"; as happens commonly{{cn|date=November 2013}} on the [[Moscow Metro]] and other mass transport systems in [[Russia]].

===Optical===
[[File:Toranomon-Station-2005-6-12.jpg|thumb|Turnstiles at [[Toranomon Station]] on the [[Tokyo Metro]] [[Tokyo Metro Ginza Line|Ginza Line]]]]
Optical turnstiles are an alternative to the traditional "arm"-style turnstile and are increasingly used in locations where a physical barrier is deemed unnecessary or unaesthetic. Optical turnstiles generally use an infrared beam to count patrons and recognize anyone attempting to enter a site without a valid entry pass.

=== Full-height turnstiles ===
The full-height turnstile, is a larger version of the turnstile, commonly {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} high, similar in operation to a [[revolving door]], which eliminates the possibility (inherent in the waist-high style) of anyone jumping over the turnstile. It is also known as an "iron maiden", after the [[iron maiden (torture device)|torture device]] of the same name, or "high-wheel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/iron_maiden_or_heet_high_entrance_exit_turnstile/|title=The Big Apple: Iron Maiden or HEET (High Entrance/Exit Turnstile)|last=Barry|first=Popik|date=July 17, 2005|work=The Big Apple|publisher=barrypopik.com/|accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref> It is sometimes called a "Rotogate", especially in Chicago, where it is used at unstaffed exits of [[Chicago 'L']] stations, and is also used at many [[New York City Subway]] stations. In Europe, however, "Rotogate" refers to a different kind of gate that is not a turnstile.

There are two types of full height turnstiles, High Entrance/Exit Turnstile (HEET) and Exit-Only. The difference between them is that HEET turnstiles can rotate in both directions thus allowing two-way traffic, while exit-only turnstiles can only rotate in one direction thus allowing one-way traffic. Exit-only turnstiles are commonly used in mass transit stations to allow passengers to exit the system without interfering with those entering.

==Turnstiles in Russia==
[[Image:Moscow-streetcar-turnstile-1673.jpg|thumb|right|Turnstile on a Moscow tram]]
In the public transport systems of the [[Soviet Union]], the only common use of turnstiles was at the entrance to subway stations (first introduced in [[Moscow Metro]] on 7 November 1958<ref>[http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=71 Timeline (<U+0425><U+0420><U+041E><U+041D><U+041E><U+041B><U+041E><U+0413><U+0418><U+042F>)] (Moscow Metro official site, accessed 2006-Nov-03)</ref>). City buses and commuter trains usually operated on the [[honor system]]. But as fare collection became a more pressing business in post-Soviet Russia, railway terminals and high-traffic railway station in the [[Moscow]] area, [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and elsewhere had turnstiles installed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the early 2000s, Moscow authorities sought to further improve fare collection; since enclosing all bus and tram stops and providing them with fare gates was not feasible, they installed turnstiles ''inside'' each [[city bus]] and [[tram]]. This practice has caused passenger complaints, as it slowed boarding compared to the traditional honor system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} A similar system is in use in [[Brazil]]ian and some [[Chile]]an city buses, and in Hong Kong Trams.

== Electronic turnstiles ==

This modern turnstile requires that the user swipes a [[magnetic stripe card]]. This causes the [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]] barriers to retract, allowing access.]]
The first electronic barriers were developed by [[OMRON]] of Japan.<ref>[http://www.omron.com/about/corporate/history/ayumi/innovation.html 1967: Developing an Unmanned Train Station System] (Omron Global, accessed 01-November-2012)</ref>
