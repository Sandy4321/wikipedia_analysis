'''Kumba''' is a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] [[sit down roller coaster]] located at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]], in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Opened in 1993, it stands {{convert|143|ft}} tall and has a top speed of {{Convert|60|mph}}.<ref name="strengle" /> ''Kumba'' features a total of seven inversions across the 3-minute ride. 

==History==
[[Busch Entertainment]], the owners of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, approached Bolliger & Mabillard to design and build two roller coasters, one for the Tampa Bay park, and another for its sister park, [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Virginia]]. However, Bolliger & Mabillard was a small company at the time and was unable to fulfill both contracts due to prior contracts with other parks. As a result, Busch Gardens Williamsburg contracted [[Arrow Dynamics]] to construct ''[[Drachen Fire]]'' which opened in 1992, leaving Bolliger & Mabillard to design and build ''Kumba'' at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.<ref name="A tale of two coasters part 2: Kumba vs. Drachen Fire">{{cite news|last=Yates|first=Eric|title=A tale of two coasters part 2: Kumba vs. Drachen Fire|accessdate=July 5, 2013|newspaper=[[Examiner.com]]|date=August 8, 2010}}</ref>

''Kumba'' was officially announced in November 1992 as a record-breaking ride set to become the park's signature attraction.<ref name="Kumba Coasting To Busch Gardens">{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Vicki|title=Kumba Coasting To Busch Gardens|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-11-16/business/9211141072_1_kumba-busch-theme-park|accessdate=July 8, 2013|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=November 16, 1992}}</ref> The ride officially opened to the public on April 20, 1993.<ref name=RCDB>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Kumba|location=Busch Gardens Tampa Bay|rcdb_number=94|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref> When ''Kumba'' opened, it featured the world's tallest vertical loop,<ref name="Kumba Coasting To Busch Gardens" /> and was also the tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster in Florida.<ref name="Florida's tallest">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Record Holders|location=Tallest roller coasters in Florida|accessdate=July 8, 2013|url=http://www.rcdb.com/rhr.htm?m=2&l=3180}}</ref><ref name="Florida's fastest">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Record Holders|location=Fastest roller coasters in Florida|accessdate=July 8, 2013|url=http://www.rcdb.com/rhr.htm?m=2&l=3180}}</ref><ref name="Florida's longest">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Record Holders|location=Longest roller coasters in Florida|accessdate=July 8, 2013|url=http://www.rcdb.com/rhr.htm?m=2&l=3180}}</ref> In 1995, ''Kumba'' conceded the title of ride with the world's tallest vertical loop to ''[[Dragon Khan]]'' at [[PortAventura]] which features a {{Convert|118|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} vertical loop.<ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Dragon Khan|location=PortAventura|rcdb_number=760|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> In 1996, it conceded Florida's titles of tallest and longest roller coaster to ''[[Montu (roller coaster)|Montu]]'', a Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster in the Egypt section of the park.<ref name="Florida's tallest" /><ref name="Florida's longest" /> In 1999, it conceded the fastest title to [[Islands of Adventure]]'s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (roller coaster)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', yet another Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster.<ref name="Florida's fastest" />

==Characteristics==
{{Stack|[[File:Kumba at Busch Gardens Tampa.JPG|thumb|One of ''Kumba''{{'}}s trains exiting the second corkscrew]]}}
The {{convert|3978|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ''Kumba'' stands {{convert|143|ft|m}} tall. With a top speed of {{Convert|60|mph}}, the ride features seven inversions including a {{Convert|114|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} vertical loop, a [[dive loop]], a [[zero-g roll]], a [[cobra roll]] and two [[Corkscrew (roller coaster element)|interlocking corkscrews]].<ref name="RCDB" /> The vertical loop featured on ''Kumba'' wraps around the lift hill; ''[[Riddler's Revenge (roller coaster)|Riddler's Revenge]]'' at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] is the only other ride in the world to feature loops of this kind. ''Kumba'' was the first ride in the world to feature a number of now-common roller coaster elements, including interlocking corkscrews and a dive loop.<ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Roller Coaster Search Results|location=Interlocking Corkscrews|accessdate=July 8, 2013|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&el=8877&page=1&order=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Roller Coaster Search Results|location=Dive Loop|accessdate=July 8, 2013|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&el=8879&page=1&order=10}}</ref> Riders of ''Kumba'' experience up to 3.8 times the [[G-force|force of gravity]] on the 3 minute ride.<ref name=RCDB />

''Kumba'' features four steel and fiberglass [[Train (roller coaster)|train]]s, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train. The [[block section]]s only allow for three trains to be on the track at any one time, meaning the ride can still operate at full capacity when one train is receiving maintenance. Under three train operation, the ride caters for 1,700 riders per hour.<ref name=RCDB />

The name ''Kumba'' was derived from the translation of "''Roar''" in the African [[Kongo Language]].<ref name="strengle">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y_ENAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wHoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4989,393462&dq=kumba+busch+gardens|title=Thrill of 'Kumba' to roar into park|last=Strengle|first=Bernice|date=November 11, 1992|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref>

==Ride experience==
[[File:Kumbas zero-g roll 2.jpg|thumb|The zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of [[Air-time|weightlessness]]]]
The ride begins with a right-hand, 90-degree turn out of the [[Station (roller coaster)|station]] which leads into the {{convert|143|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[chain lift hill]]. After reaching the peak, a small [[pre-drop]] leads into a {{convert|135|ft|m|adj=on}} drop to the left. A {{convert|108|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} vertical loop which wraps around the lift hill follows. After leaving the vertical loop, the ride inclines into a dive loop, followed by a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of [[Air-time|weightlessness]]. A straight section of track and a small hill leads to a [[Cobra roll]], inverting riders twice. After exiting the cobra roll, the trains rise up into the [[mid-course brake run]]. The exit from the brake run leads into a pair of [[interlocking corkscrews]], a tunnel, and an upward helix. The train then enters the final [[brake run]], before making a right hand turn and returning to the station.<ref name=RCDB /><ref name=POV>{{cite web|last=Alvey|first=Robb|title=Kumba Roller Coaster POV Front Seat Amazing 1080p HD Footage Busch Gardens Tampa FL|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x0U5BLvMOA|work=[[Theme Park Review]]|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 8, 2013|authorlink=Robb Alvey|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref>
