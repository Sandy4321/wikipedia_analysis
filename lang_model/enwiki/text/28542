'''Jet streams''' are fast flowing, relatively narrow [[thermal wind|air current]]s found at the [[tropopause]], the transition between the [[troposphere]] (where temperature decreases with height) and the [[stratosphere]] (where temperature increases with height),<ref>[[United States Department of Energy]] 26 June 2002.

and are located at 10-15&nbsp;kilometers above the surface of the [[Earth]]. They form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in [[temperature]], such as the [[polar region]] and the warmer air to the south.<ref>[[University of Illinois]]. [http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cyc/upa/jet.rxml Jet Stream.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-04]].</ref>  The path of the jet typically has a [[meander]]ing shape, and these meanders known as [[Rossby waves]].  Rossby waves propagate westward with respect to the flow in which they are embedded, which translates to a slower eastward migration across the globe than smaller scale [[shortwave (meteorology)|short wave troughs]].  The major jet streams are westerly winds (flowing west to east) in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. 

During the [[summer]], low-level easterly jets can form in tropical regions.  A southerly low level jet in the [[Great Plains]] helps fuel overnight [[thunderstorm]] activity, normally in the form of [[mesoscale convective system]]s.  A similar northerly low-level jet can form across [[Australia]], instigated by cut-off lows which develop across southwest portions of the country.

Meteorologists use the location of the jet stream as an aid in [[weather forecasting]].  The main commercial use of the jet stream is during airline travel, as flying long distances along the jet stream can cut hours off a long distance trip.  One type of [[clear-air turbulence]] is found in the jet stream's vicinity, which can be a hazard to aircraft.  One future benefit of the jet stream could be to augment power generation within the next 10 to 20 years, if technological hurdles can be overcome.

==Discovery==
The existence of the jet stream may have been first detected in the 1920s by Japanese meteorologist Wasaburo Ooishi.<ref>John M. Lewis.

American pilot [[Wiley Post]], the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of the jet stream. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above {{convert|6200|m|ft}}. In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and certainly he noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.<ref>Acepilots.com.

==Description==
[[Image:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Cross section of the subtropical and polar jet streams by latitude]]
There are two main jet streams north of subtropical [[latitude]]s, with a weaker [[subtropical]] stream closer to the [[equator]].  The polar jet stream is typically located near the 250&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (7.38&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) pressure level, or {{convert|7|km|mi}} to {{convert|12|km|mi}} above [[sea level]], while the subtropical jet is much higher, between {{convert|10|km|mi}} and {{convert|16|km|mi}} above sea level.  Both upper-level jet streams form near breaks in the tropopause, which is at a higher altitude near the equator than it is over the poles, with large changes in its height occurring near the location of the jet stream.<ref name="COOK">David R.

Jet streams are typically continuous over long distances, but discontinuities are common.<ref name="GOMdef">Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=jet-stream1 Jet Stream.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-08]].</ref>  The path of the jet typically has a meandering shape, and these meanders themselves propagate east, at lower speeds than that of the actual [[wind]] within the flow.  Each large meander, or wave, within the jet stream is known as a Rossby wave.  Rossby waves are caused by changes in the [[Coriolis effect]] with latitude, and propagate westward with respect to the flow in which they are embedded, which slows down the eastward migration of upper level troughs and ridges across the globe when compared to their embedded shortwave troughs.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology.

The wind speeds vary according to the temperature [[gradient]], exceeding {{convert|92|km/h|kn}},<ref name="GOMdef">Glossary of Meteorology.

==Cause==
===Upper-level variety===
[[Image:Jetstreamconfig.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|General configuration of the polar and subtropical jet streams]]
{{See also|Extratropical cyclone|Thermal wind}}
In general, winds are strongest just under the tropopause (except during [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference (which causes wind) is highest within the transition zone.  The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.<ref name="Stimac">John P. Stimac. [http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfjps/1400/pressure_wind.html Air pressure and wind.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-08]].</ref>  The [[polar front]] and [[Subtropical jet stream|subtropical jets]] merge at some locations and times, while at other times they are well separated.  

All these facts are consequences of the [[thermal wind]] relation. The balance of forces on an atmospheric parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the pressure gradient and the force of gravity, a balance referred to as [[hydrostatic]].   In the horizontal, the dominant balance outside of the tropics is between the Coriolis effect and the pressure gradient, a balance referred to as [[geostrophic]].  Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical derivative of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient.  The sense of the relation is such that temperatures decreasing polewards implies that winds develop a larger eastward component as one moves upwards.  Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the equator is warmer than the north and south poles.<ref name="Stimac">John P. Stimac. [http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfjps/1400/pressure_wind.html Air pressure and wind.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-08]].</ref>

The thermal wind relation does not immediately provide an explanation for why the winds are organized in tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere.  There are two factors that contribute to this sharpness of the jets.  One is the tendency for developing cyclonic disturbances in midlatitudes to form [[Surface_weather_analysis#Fronts|fronts]].  A front is a sharp localized gradient in temperature.  The polar front jet stream can be thought of as the result of this [[frontogenesis]] process in midlatitudes, as the storms concentrate the north-south temperature contrast into relatively narrow regions.<ref name="GOMdef">Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=jet-stream1 Jet Stream.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-08]].</ref>

An alternative explanation is more appropriate for the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical [[Hadley cell]].  One can visualize this circulation as being symmetric with respect to longitude.  Rings of air encircling the Earth move polewards beneath the [[tropopause]] from the equator into the subtropics.  As they do so they tend to conserve their angular momentum.  But they are also moving closer to the axis of rotation, so they must spin faster in the direction of rotation, implying an increased eastward component of the winds.<ref>[[Lyndon State College]] Meteorology. [http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter10/subt_jet_form.html Jet Stream Formation - Subtropical Jet.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-08]].</ref>

[[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere has multiple jet streams, forming the familiar banded color structure, caused by internal heating.<ref name="ROBROY">Robert Roy Britt. [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_sidebar_000209.html et Streams On Earth and Jupiter.] Retrieved on [[2008-05-04]].</ref>  The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology.  In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams increases.

===Low-level variety===
There are low-level wind maxima in the atmosphere that are referred to as jets, such as the [[African easterly jet]] which occurs during the Northern Hemisphere [[summer]] between 10<U+00B0>N and 20<U+00B0>N from the [[Indian Ocean]] across [[Africa]], and the nocturnal poleward [[low-level jet]] in the [[Great Plains]].
