'''Hurricane Ophelia''' was the fifteenth named [[tropical cyclone]] and the eighth hurricane of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. It was a long-lived storm that was most remembered for its very erratic and extremely slow track off the [[East Coast of the United States]], alternating several times between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. 

Ophelia caused some damage and beach erosion along the [[United States]] coastline from [[Florida]] to [[North Carolina]], with its closest approach occuring on [[September 14]] and [[September 15|15]] with its western [[eyewall]] crossing land and the eye remaining just offshore. Minimal damage and erosion was also reported in [[Atlantic Canada]] when Ophelia hit as a tropical storm in [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] transition on [[September 17]] and [[September 18|18]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Ophelia 2005 track.png}}
On [[September 6]] a non-tropical low over the northern Bahamas became more organized and formed into Tropical Depression Sixteen between [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]] and [[Grand Bahama]]. Shortly after forming the depression moved over Grand Bahama and moved north parallel to the [[Florida]] coastline.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Ophelia|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=July 8|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL162005_Ophelia.pdf}}</ref> The computer models initially predicted two distinct possibilities for the storms future with some models indicating the storm would cross over Florida and enter the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and other indicating that it would stay offshore and move to the northeast. The official forecast from the [[National Hurricane Center]] followed the first set of guidance, though with low confidence.<ref name="NHC-disc3">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Depression Sixteen, 11:00 p.m. EDT, September 6 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 31|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al162005.discus.003.shtml}}</ref> The storm strengthened to become Tropical Storm Ophelia early on [[September 7]] and became a hurricane briefly the next day.<ref name="TCR"/>

From [[September 9]] to [[September 11]], Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being downgraded to a tropical storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved only very slowly and erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall on the east coast of the United States. The forecasters indicated there was a possibility that Ophelia could strengthen further to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] strength, though they felt this was unlikely.<ref name="NHC-disc15">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Ophelia, 11:00 p.m. EDT, September 9 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 31|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al162005.discus.015.shtml}}</ref> On [[September 12]] the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards [[North Carolina]], while still moving only slowly and fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the inner core of convection collapsed, possibly due to passing over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the inner core of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115&nbsp;miles (185&nbsp;km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout [[September 14]]-[[September 15]], but the strongest winds remained offshore.<ref name="TCR"/>

As Hurricane Ophelia moved past [[Cape Hatteras]] it turned to the east. Wind shear increased on [[September 16]] and weakened Ophelia into a tropical storm for the last time. Ophelia turned to the northeast and brushed past [[Nantucket Island]], [[Massachusetts]] the next day. As it approached [[Nova Scotia]] on [[September 17]], the storm became [[extratropical]] but maintained its strength as it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province.  The extratropical storm passed over southern [[Newfoundland]] later that day and finally dissipated on [[September 23]] in the [[North Sea]].<ref name="TCR"/>

==Preparations==
As soon as Tropical Depression Sixteen formed on [[September 6]], the government of the [[Bahamas]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] for the northwestern Bahamas and the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a tropical storm warning for much of the east [[Florida]] coastline. On [[September 10]], with forecasts indicating that Ophelia would make landfall in [[South Carolina]] as a hurricane, the NHC issued a hurricane watch for much of the coastline of [[the Carolinas]]. As the storm neared the [[Outer Banks]], the watch was upgraded to a warning for the areas closest to the predicted route of the storm .<ref name="TCR"/> 

As Ophelia was predicted to pass near southeast [[New England]], the NHC issued tropical storm warnings for much of the south [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]] coastlines.<ref name="TCR"/> In [[Atlantic Canada]], considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, primarily because of memories of [[Hurricane Juan]] of the {{tcseason|2003|Atlantic|hurricane}}, which had caught the authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]]'s first ever tropical storm warnings which were cancelled when Ophelia became [[extratropical]].<ref name="CHC">http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20050918060047.Ophelia.txt.en</ref>

==Impact==
===Florida===
Before Ophelia made its closest approach to land near the Outer Banks on [[September 15]] and 16, it caused a significant [[coastal erosion]] event for coastal Florida, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]], as the storm's slow movement resulted in several continuous days of rough surf. <ref>http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/news/nation/12606151.htm</ref> At [[Flagler Beach, Florida]], the erosion endangered the foundation of highway A1A, and 140 dump trucks were brought in to buttress the road with rocks and sand. <ref>http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/topstories/news-article.aspx?storyid=43998</ref> 

In southeastern Florida, a man drowned in the high surf generated by Ophelia. His was the only direct death caused by the storm and the first of three overall fatalities. <ref>http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/tws/MIATWSAT_sep.shtml</ref>

===North Carolina===
[[Image:CAP-05-1077136.jpg|left|thumb|Coastal damage after Hurricane Ophelia]]
Ophelia moved extremely slowly in and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10 inches (254 mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5 inches (445 mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7-12 feet (2-4 m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of [[Pamlico Sound]]. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power <ref>http://rdu.news14.com/content/hurricane_info/?ArID=74479&SecID=431</ref> in coastal North Carolina. <ref>http://www.wral.com/news/4981365/detail.html</ref> One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded. <ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/hurricane_ophelia;_ylt=AsJmeeP315NmB_IyPlZ.IJOs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--</ref> 
[[Image:CAROLINA BEACH.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding in [[Carolina Beach]], [[North Carolina]]]]
Damage was heaviest in [[Salter Path, North Carolina]] and along the [[Outer Banks]] near that community, where (despite being only a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] storm) many buildings suffered significant damage as a result of the storm surge, which has been described as worse than [[Hurricane Isabel]] in [[2003]] and even compared to [[Hurricane Hazel]] in [[1954]]. It should be noted that nearly all of the significant damage occurred on the sound side, or the side facing the mainland.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/hurricane_ophelia;_ylt=AsJmeeP315NmB_IyPlZ.IJOs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--</ref> In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. Damage was generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural damage was relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] area. <ref>http://www.wect.com/Global/story.asp?S=3854569&nav=2gQaeZ0g</ref> Damage was initially estimated to be about $1.6 billion <ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/NHC/TWSAT</ref>, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70 million. <ref name="TCR"/>

===New England and Canada===
In [[New England]] and [[Canada]], overall damage was minimal, and only brief, sporadic power outages were reported. One indirect storm-related fatality was reported in [[Nova Scotia]] as a result of a person falling during minor roof repairs. <ref>http://www.herald.ns.ca/stories/2005/09/18/f177.raw.html</ref> In [[Newfoundland]], over 50 millimeters (1.96 inches) of rain fell over parts of the eastern region of the province. <ref>http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=569bb90f-47d8-46ba-a20d-330578bb0b8b</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[President Bush]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in 37 counties in North Carolina as a result of Ophelia. <ref>http://www.wric.com/Global/story.asp?S=3853315</ref>

==Naming and records==

When Tropical Storm Ophelia formed on [[September 7]], it was the earliest ever in the season that the fifteenth storm formed, beating the previous record held by hurricane 15 of the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]] by 9 days. This first time an Atlantic storm had been named "Ophelia", although it had previously to name four storms in the West Pacific. Due to the lack of any major effects from [[Hurricane Ophelia]], the name was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and will be on the list of names for the 2011 Season.
