'''HMS ''Activity''''' was an [[escort carrier]] that served with the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After the war, she was sold into merchant service as the '''MV ''Breconshire''''', serving for over 20 years until scrapped in 1967.

==History==
===Royal Navy===
HMS ''Activity'' was built at [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company|Caledon shipyards]] in [[Dundee]]. When construction started in 1940 she was intended to become the [[Reefer (ship)|refrigerated cargo ship]] ''Telemachus'' for the [[Blue Funnel Line|Alfred Holt Line]].<ref name=Fleet>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/Ships/Activity.html |title=HMS Activity |publisher=Fleet Air Arm Archive |accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref> In February 1941, she was taken over by the [[Ministry of War Transport]] and renamed '''''Empire Activity'''''. In January 1942, she was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] for conversion to an escort carrier, now named HMS ''Activity'' and carrying pennant number D94. Following her launch in May 1942 and completion in August of that year, ''Activity'' worked up at [[Lamlash]] before going to [[Rosyth]] for rectification of defects. Entering service on 1 January 1943, ''Activity'' initially operated as a deck landing training carrier. ''Activity'' operating in this r<U+00F4>le until October 1943 when she was sent to [[Liverpool]] for a refit before entering active service.<ref name=Activity>{{cite web|url= http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/ACTIVITY.htm |title=A History of HMS Activity |publisher=Royal Navy Research Archive |accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>

After her refit, ''Activity'' took part in convoy escort duties in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939-1945)|North Atlantic]]. ''Activity'' embarked [[819 Naval Air Squadron]] on 12 January 1944, and began escort duties on the 29 January as part of the Second Escort Group. ''Activity'' was involved in the escort of convoys OS&nbsp;66, KMS&nbsp;40, ON&nbsp;222, NS&nbsp;28, SL&nbsp;147, MKS&nbsp;38, HX&nbsp;277, KMS&nbsp;43 and MKF&nbsp;29 in the period to March 1944. Following this, ''Activity'' moved to the [[Arctic convoys|Arctic]], escorting convoy [[Convoy JW 58|JW 58]] to [[Murmansk]]. <!--She was used in Arctic convoys as British construction was deemed more durable in the extreme cold than American welded vessels.--> Her aircraft<U+2014>together with those from {{HMS|Tracker|D24|2}}<U+2014>were responsible for the sinking of U-boat {{GS|U-288||2}}, and {{GS|U-355||2}}, as well as damaging {{GS|U-362||2}}, {{GS|U-673||2}} and {{GS|U-990||2}}. The return convoy<U+2014>RA&nbsp;58<U+2014>reached its destination without loss.<ref name=Activity/>

In May 1944, ''Activity'' spent some time at a shipyard on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] for defect rectification before rejoining the Second Escort Group for escort duties. ''Activity'' escorted convoys OS&nbsp;78, KMS&nbsp;52, SL&nbsp;158, MKS&nbsp;49, OS&nbsp;78, KMS&nbsp;52, AL&nbsp;159, MKS&nbsp;50, SL&nbsp;162, MK&nbsp;53, KMF&nbsp;33, MKF&nbsp;33, OS&nbsp;86, KMS&nbsp;60, SL&nbsp;167 and MKS&nbsp;58.<ref name=Activity/>

In August 1944, ''Activity'' was designated as a ferry carrier. She  transported aircraft, personnel and supplies to [[Trincomalee]], [[Ceylon]], arriving on 23 October 1944 and returning via [[Gibraltar]], where she joined convoy MKF&nbsp;36 back to the United Kingdom. ''Activity'' spent some time in a Clyde shipyard in December 1944 for defect rectification, after which she was reallocated to the East Indies Fleet and given a new pennant number, R301. She sailed with convoy KM&nbsp;39 on 29 January 1945, arriving in [[Colombo]] on 20 February.<ref name=Activity/> Whilst en route to [[Sydney]], ''Activity'' rescued the 92 survivors from {{SS|Peter Silvester||6}}, an American [[liberty ship]] which had been sunk by {{GS|U-862||2}} on 6 February 1945,<ref name=Uboat>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3295.html|title=HMS Activity (D 94)|publisher= U-boat.net|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref> the last Allied ship sunk by enemy action in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Survivors from ''Peter Silvester'' were landed at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and ''Activity'' then continued her journey to Sydney.<ref name=Activity/>

''Activity'' departed Sydney on 24 March, bound for Colombo for duty ferrying aircraft from [[Kochi, India|Cochin]] to Colombo. After the end of the war, ''Activity'' was sent to [[Singapore]] to support the reoccupation of Singapore. She loaded ex-POWs and other passengers and sailed for Trincomalee on 15 September. ''Activity'' arrived home on the Clyde on 20 October 1945, and was then de-stored and placed in the [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve Fleet]]. She was placed in the Category B Reserve on 30 January 1946, and sold to [[Glen Lines]] on 25 March 1946 for conversion to a merchant ship.<ref name=Activity/>

===Merchant Navy===
''Activity'' was converted to a ''Glenearn'' class merchant ship by [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company|Palmers]] of [[Hebburn-on-Tyne]], and renamed ''Breconshire'', entering service with Glen Line in September 1947. She was the second Glen Line ship to be named ''Breconshire''. She measured 9,061&nbsp;[[gross register tonnage|gross register ton]]s. She remained in service until April 1967, sailing from [[Kobe]] to [[Mihara, Hiroshima|Mihara]] for scrapping, arriving there on 24 April 1967.<ref name=Duster>{{cite web|url=http://www.red-duster.co.uk/GLEN11.htm |title=GLEN LINE FLEET |publisher=Red Duster |accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>
