'''Jonathan Niven "Jon" Cryer''' (born April 16, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer]]. He is the son of actress<U+2013>singer [[Gretchen Cryer]]. He made his motion picture debut by starring in the 1984 romantic comedy ''[[No Small Affair]]'', but gained greater fame by starring as "Duckie" in the 1986 [[John Hughes (director)|John Hughes]]-scripted film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. In 1998 he finished writing and producing the independent film ''[[Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five]]'', which was well received.<ref name="RT1" />

Even though Cryer gained some fame by starring in these movies, it took several years to find success on [[television]]; the shows he had starred in (''[[The Famous Teddy Z]]'', ''[[Partners (TV series)|Partners]]'' and ''The Trouble with Normal'') did not last very long. In 2003 he was cast to portray [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan Harper]] on the [[CBS]] hit comedy series ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', opposite [[Charlie Sheen]], for which Cryer won a Primetime [[Emmy Award]] in 2009.<ref name="emmywin">{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20304925_20305842,00.html|title=Kristin Chenoweth, Jon Cryer Are Emmy Night's First Winners|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|date=2009-09-20|work=People|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> He received three earlier Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on the show.<ref name=08emmynoms>{{cite news|publisher=''[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]''|date=2008-07-17|url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/awards/2008pte/60thpte_noms.php|title=Complete 2008 Nominations List|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref><ref name="07emmynoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/2007pt/59thnominations.php |title=The 59th Primetime Emmy Awards and Creative Arts Emmy Awards Nominees are... |accessdate=2008-03-02 |publisher=''[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]''}}</ref><ref name="06emmynoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/downloads/images/2006emmys/PrimetimeNoms.php |title=The 58th Primetime Emmy Awards and Creative Arts Emmys Nominations |accessdate=2008-03-02 |publisher=''[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]''}}</ref>

Cryer was born in New York City, New York. His mother, [[Gretchen Cryer]] ([[Married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Kiger), is a playwright, songwriter, actress, and singer, and his father, Donald David Cryer, was an actor/singer who originally studied to be a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref name="Filmref1">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/78/Jon-Cryer.html|title=Jon Cryer Biography (1965-)|publisher=Filmreference|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Donald Eugene|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Indiana authors and their books, 1967-1980|publisher=Wabash College|year=1981|location=|pages=90|month=|url=|id=}}</ref><ref name=yba>{{Cite web|last=Conn|first=Suzy|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=More on Gretchen Cryer|publisher=Blogway Baby|date=2005-02-20|url=http://www.blogwaybaby.com/2005/02/more-on-gretchen-cryer.shtml|accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> He has two sisters, Robin and Shelley.<ref name="E!" /> When he was twelve years old, he decided that he wanted to become an actor.<ref name="TT" /> When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked, "Plumbing is a pretty good career."<ref name="E!" /> Cryer attended [[Stagedoor Manor]] Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stagedoormanor.com/|title=Stagedoor Manor, Performing Arts Training Center|work=Stagedoor Alumni|publisher=[[Stagedoor Manor]] Official Website|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> and is a 1983 graduate of the [[Bronx High School of Science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Jon_Cryer/194722|title=Jon Cryer|work=Education|publisher=[[Hollywood]].com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> He was classmates with [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]] [[Boaz Yakin]].<ref>[http://www.ffeu.org/2000%20annual%20report%20for%20web.pdf Foundation for Ethnic Understanding FFEU website 2000 Annual Report].

==Career==
At age 19, Cryer first appeared in the 1984 romantic comedy film ''[[No Small Affair]]'', having the lead role as Charles Cummings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9E01E2D9143AF93AA35752C1A962948260|title=No Small Affair (1984)|work=Jon Cryer In "No Small Affair"|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=1984-11-09|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> He went on to have small roles in films and [[TV Movie|television movies]], and he made his breakthrough when he was cast to portray Phil "Duckie" Dale in the [[John Hughes (director)|John Hughes]]-scripted film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1328652,00.html|title=Don't You Forget About Duckie|work=To mark a new special-edition DVD of "Pretty in Pink", Emmy nominee Jon Cryer chats with Mandi Bierly about the movie's original ending, "Try a Little Tenderness", and more|first=Mandi|last=Bierly|date=2006-08-23|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', Cryer's mother said that after ''Pretty in Pink'', she started getting calls from teenage girls from all over the world, who would leave hysterical, giggling messages on her answering machine.<ref name="E!">{{cite web|title=Jon Cryer - Profile, Latest News and Related Articles|url=http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=6539c6ba-c9e8-4e14-a903-cb833f854618|work=Notes|publisher=[[E!

In 1987, he portrayed [[Superman]] villain [[Lenny Luthor]] in ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]''.<ref name="E!" /> In 1989, he got the lead role in the TV comedy series, ''[[The Famous Teddy Z]]''. His performance gained poor reviews<ref name="EW1">{{cite news|title=TV Review - The Famous Teddy Z|first=Ken|last=Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317443,00.html|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=1990-05-25|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> and the show was canceled after the first season.<ref name="EW1"/>

One year later, he starred with Charlie Sheen in the [[Jim Abrahams]] comedy ''[[Hot Shots!]]'',<ref name="TT" /> which was received very positively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1036179-hot_shots/|title=Hot Shots!

In 1995 he was cast to portray Bob in the sitcom ''[[Partners (TV series)|Partners]]'', which, like his prior show ''The Famous Teddy Z'', was canceled after its first season. In an interview with ''[[Time Out New York]]'' he stated, "Hey, every show I'm in goes down. Think about this: [[George Clooney]] was in 28 pilots, or something. It means nothing".<ref name="E!" /> After guest starring on shows such as ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' and ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', he successfully wrote and produced his first film, ''[[Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five]]''. It debuted in 1998 at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] and gained positive reviews from critics.<ref name="RT1">{{cite web|title=Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God...

For the third time, Cryer starred in a show which was canceled after its first season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting={5C0E1B12-1F43-4C3D-926A-44A9D14730D2}|title=Sheen and Cryer: Sitcom Survivors|first=Daniel R.|last=Coleridge|date=2003-07-23|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''}}</ref>

Cryer's unsuccessful track record with television finally came to a halt three years later. Against the wishes of CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures), he was cast in 2003 to portray [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan Harper]] on the hit comedy series ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. To date, he has earned four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations and one win<ref name="emmywin" /> for his acting work on the show.<ref name=08emmynoms/><ref name=07emmynoms/><ref name=06emmynoms/> In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said, "When you<U+2019>re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, <U+2018>My instincts haven't worked so far.<U+2019> But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes a huge amount of pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before."<ref name="TT"/> Before being cast for ''Two and a Half Men'', Cryer tried out for the role of [[Gaius Baltar]] on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]]'s reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''. The role went to [[James Callis]].<ref>Vary, Adam B. "Battlestar Galactica: The Beginning of the End." Entertainment Weekly 20 Mar. 2009: 42.</ref> In 2008, Cryer appeared with [[Laurence Fishburne]] and [[James Cromwell]] in the film ''[[Tortured (film)|Tortured]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/hr/login/login_subscribe.jsp?id=yF3FFJoP9vNm5af43q8W2RKsNqDmrM1%2Fzbx5AiSOUtGW3Ls9PUV5GMgJS%2BeoDy1JUAbgJRjkvOQv%0AROWIBdvnUW8FoVMFx1KtkCdEnYqLUz2SQYpe976VbXZI6WmQKJx8GoWY%2BuCJjYxQDAOD9x59MjQz%0AaAG%2F4%2BtoYa1POTzHtgmnGrnkGnbYoH9qdhYK2%2BCS9KTxeCr1n5NNHtR25eWKkCg%2BBhnN4qMU9cYt%0AfoDqV4cU2jdAynXsUvdLd6kxAoxxh5tTNp5RGzWGfc8TCFXxfgXoV0VQjlX4yatf6wgCm%2BrtSvUs%0AGywJxaF3a4QoV9rev97ClEo21%2F43lqxlhy4%2FUtfJvHbBin432gV1vXTfSn0%3D|title=Jon Cryer and James Denton to get Tortured|first=Matt|last=Holmes|date=2007-05-15|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> and in 2009 co-starred with [[James Spader]] in the film ''[[Shorts (film)|Shorts]]''.<ref name="DS">{{cite web|first=Beth|last=Hilton|date=2008-05-30|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a97096/cryer-spader-join-rodriguezs-shorts.html?imdb|publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''|title=Cryer, Spader join Rodriguez's 'Shorts'|accessdate=June 22, 2008}}</ref>

Cryer's voice can also be heard doing voice-overs for [[Wells Fargo]] in the company's radio and television ads.

==Personal life==
Cryer married British-born actress Sarah Trigger in 1999, with whom he has a son, Charlie Austin,<ref name="E!" /> but the pair divorced in 2004. In February 2007, on an episode of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show With Jay Leno]]'', he announced that he was going to marry entertainment reporter [[Lisa Joyner]]; the couple married in [[Mexico]]<ref name="E!" /> in June 2007.<ref name="marriage">{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1318832.php|title=Jon Cryer marries Lisa Joyner|publisher=Monstersand Critics|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20035011,00.html|title=Jon Cryer of Two and a Half Men to Wed in Summer|first=Cynthia|last=Wang|date=2007-04-13|publisher=''[[People.com]]''|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> On September 29, 2009, it was announced that Jon and Lisa had adopted a baby girl, whom they named Daisy.<ref>{{cite news | author=Gina DiNunno | title=Jon Cryer and Lisa Joyner Adopt Baby Girl| url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jon-Cryer-Lisa-1010280.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=29 September 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-29}}</ref><p>

On May 28, 2009, Sarah Trigger's current husband told police that their two-year-old son had rope marks around his neck. This resulted in her arrest on felony child neglect charges. She was released later that same evening on $100,000 bail.<ref>http://www.mahalo.com/sarah-trigger</ref>
On January 15, 2010, it was reported that Cryer told police he believed his life was in danger and that his ex-wife had hired a hitman to kill him. The following weekend, ''Two and a Half Men'' was filmed without its usual live audience, apparently due to concerns over Cryer's safety.<ref>{{cite news | author=ninemsn | title=Jon Cryer says ex-wife plotted to kill him | url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/1002833/jon-cryer-says-ex-wife-plotted-to-kill-him | work=ninemsn | date=22 January
