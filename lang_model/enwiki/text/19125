'''''Showgirls''''' is a [[sexploitation]] [[1995 in film|1995 film]] [[film director|directed]] by [[Paul Verhoeven]].  It stars former [[child actor|teen actress]] [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]] and [[Gina Gershon]]. The film centres on a drifter who ventures to [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] and climbs the seedy hierarchy from [[striptease|stripper]] to [[showgirl]].

Significant controversy and hype surrounding the film's amounts of [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and [[nudity]] preceded its release. In the [[United States]], the movie was [[List of NC-17 rated films|rated NC-17]] for "[[nudity]] and [[erotic]] [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] throughout, some [[profanity|graphic language]] and [[sexual violence]]." ''Showgirls'' was the first and only NC-17 rated film to be given a wide release in mainstream theaters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E31F932A15754C0A963958260 |title=First Major Film With an NC-17 Rating Is Embraced by the Studio - New York Times |work= The New York Times|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> United Artists dispatched several hundred staffers to theatres across the United States playing ''Showgirls'' in order to assure that patrons would not be sneaking into the theater from other films, and to make sure the film goers were over the age of 17. 

Though the movie did not do well in theaters, ''Showgirls'' enjoyed success on the [[home video]] market, generating more than $100 million from video rentals <ref name="ReferenceA">Wiser, Paige. "The beauty of 'Showgirls'", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', July 27, 2004</ref> and became one of [[MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070428172642/http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS MGM's official page for Showgirls DVD]</ref> For its video premiere, Verhoeven prepared an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] cut for rental outlets that would not carry NC-17 films. This edited version runs 128 minutes and deletes some of the more graphic footage, in particular frames from the infamous [[lap dance]] sequence and love scene between Nomi and Zach. ''Showgirls'' has since become regarded as a [[cult classic]]. It was released on Blu-Ray for the first time in June 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/arts/dance/25roch.html |title=Step by Step, the Showgirl Must Go On |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date= May 25, 2008|accessdate=2009-03-03 | first=Margy | last=Rochlin}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{plot|date=January 2010}}
{{wikify-section|date=April 2010}}
A young woman hitchhikes from what appears to be a truck stop; snow capped mountains are seen in the distance. A pickup truck pulls over, driven by a shady male. The young woman is unsure about whether she should accept the ride, but gets in cautiously when the man tells her he's going to Vegas. Her name is Nomi Malone ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]) and is going to Vegas to dance. When the man tries to hit on her, Nomi pulls out a switchblade. After the man freaks and almost causes a collision with a tractor trailer, Nomi agrees to put the knife away. Once they get to Las Vegas, the man takes Nomi to a casino under the pretense of getting her a job; he convinces Nomi to leave her suitcase inside the truck. Inside the casino, he leaves her with ten dollars at a slot machine, then disappears; by the time Nomi realizes what has happened, she returns to the parking lot to find his truck gone, the man having abandoned her and stolen her suitcase. As Nomi is crying and banging her fists on the side of a nearby car, the car's owner, Molly ([[Gina Ravera]]), a seamstress, confronts her. The impulsive Nomi dashes out into traffic, but Molly pulls her back just in time. After talking and discovering Nomi does not have any family or place to go, Molly takes her in. Nomi gets a job as a stripper at the sleazy Cheetah's Topless Club; she considers herself a dancer, and the Cheetah is a place where she can do this and still make a living. While out dancing for fun at a nightclub called The Crave Club, Nomi meets a bouncer named James ([[Glenn Plummer]]). James admires her dancing and Nomi is flattered until he dares to criticize what she's doing. In retaliation, Nomi kicks him between the legs and he falls into another patron, sparking a brawl. Nomi delights in what she's done, smiling to herself as all the men begin to throw punches, until someone recognizes her as the instigator and she's taken to jail. James bails her out the next morning, but Nomi still won't forgive him for his comments.

One night Nomi accompanies Molly backstage at Goddess, the topless Vegas show at the Stardust where Molly works as the costume seamstress. Since it is Nomi's dream to be a showgirl, she is thrilled to watch the show and see the backstage area. Molly introduces her to Cristal Connors ([[Gina Gershon]]), the diva-like star of the show. Molly tells Cristal that Nomi is a dancer as well, but when Nomi tells her she dances at the Cheetah, Cristal derisively tells Nomi that what she does is akin to prostitution. Nomi becomes furious, and her reaction intrigues Cristal, who is bisexual and apparently attracted to Nomi.

The next evening, Cristal and her boyfriend Zach ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit the Cheetah and pay Nomi $500 for a lap dance. Nomi does not want to do the private dance, for fear it will prove her to be the prostitute Cristal made her out to be, but is forced to do so by her manager, much to her embarrassment. James, who lurks in the Cheetah and sees Nomi performing her private dance with Zack and Cristal, confronts Nomi at her home the next day. He feels that Nomi has too much talent to be performing as a stripper, not to mention that he, too, considers it to be something similar to prostitution. Nomi angrily rebuffs him once more.

Nomi later discovers Cristal has arranged for her to have an audition as an ensemble dancer in Goddess. At the audition, the callous director of Goddess, Tony Moss ([[Alan Rachins]]), refers to Nomi as "Pollyanna" because of her outfit. Nomi dashes backstage, removes her blouse and dances in her underwear, but she notices Cristal watching silently from the darkened theater. When Nomi is told to use ice to make her nipples hard for the second part of the audition, she gets upset and leaves. Cristal approaches her as she cries backstage, and Nomi tells Cristal that she hates her. Leaving the Stardust upset, Nomi finds James working as a bellhop and he takes her back to his apartment. They have an intimate moment as James demonstrates a dance number that he conceived in honor of Nomi and her career as a private dancer.

Despite the audition, Nomi gets the job and immediately quits the Cheetah. She excitedly rushes over to tell James about her new job, but she finds him having an intimate moment with another woman; ironically, one of her co-dancers at the Cheetah. Meeting with the producers of Goddess, Nomi wears a brand new dress she bought at Versace, mispronouncing it "Vur-SAYSS" in front of everyone. Nobody corrects her on it except Zach, who tells her she looks beautiful and has great taste.

Cristal calls a truce and takes Nomi out for lunch, and they discover they have similar backgrounds. Cristal, however, calls Nomi a whore again, which Nomi angrily denies. The way Cristal sees it, they are all whores because they exchange sexual titillation for cash. Cristal also acknowledges that she is attracted to Nomi, but Nomi does not consider herself bisexual. Nevertheless, she allows Cristal to engage her in an erotic dance when they are alone, allowing Cristal to pull down her top and caress her bare breasts. As she leans in for a kiss, Cristal sneers at her "See, darlin? You ARE a whore." Nomi storms out again in a fury.

From this point on, the two are rivals once more. Cristal repeatedly takes malicious swipes at Nomi in a never-ending attempt to portray Nomi as a cheap whore, including sending Nomi on a promotional appearance with Zach's assistant, Phil Newkirk ([[Greg Travis]]). Cristal knows from experience that Nomi will be approached to have sex for cash. Nomi furiously rejects Phil's proposition and she mistakenly thinks she has an ally in Zach, who pretends to bawl Phil out over the incident.

One night, Nomi agrees to a car ride from Zach, and they end up at his large estate. Nomi seduces Zach, and they have sex in his swimming pool. As Nomi leaves the next morning, Zack mentions that there is an audition for Cristal's understudy<U+2014>a rivalry between two other showgirls has led to an onstage sabotage incident, where one of the rivals breaks her knee. Zach tells Nomi she should try out for the position. At the audition, Cristal senses a shift in the tide; Zach suggests Nomi as Cristal's understudy, and the choreographer agrees that Nomi has what it takes. Tony Moss disagrees but makes a remark about Cristal's age. Cristal also finds out that Zach slept with Nomi, and Zach gloats over it. When Nomi gets the position, Cristal is furious, and Nomi feels she finally has the upper hand. As a result, Cristal threatens to leave the show, and the producers reverse their decision. Nomi is, of course, furious; her clumsy grab for power has alienated most of the other dancers, and now Cristal seems to be in control.

Nomi goes to see James perform his number at the Crave Club, where he and his co-dancers are booed off the stage. James takes it fairly well, telling Nomi that he is giving up dancing to work in a grocery store now that his girlfriend is pregnant. Nomi bids him farewell.

During the performance of Goddess that night, Cristal taunts Nomi about her disappointment. As the dancers leave the stage, Nomi impulsively pushes Cristal down a flight of stairs, injuring her badly and sending her to the hospital. Molly knows Nomi pushed Cristal, but another dancer backs up Nomi's story and pretends that she saw the whole thing. With Cristal unable to perform, Nomi ends up getting Cristal's lead in the show, where she makes a dazzling debut and is suddenly the talk of the town.

Things seem to be going well for Nomi; she has finally secured the fame and fortune she initially sought. However, at the opening night party, Molly is brutally raped and beaten by famous musician Andrew Carver ([[William Shockley (actor)]]) and his two security guards. Molly is taken to the hospital to treat her injuries, and Zach tells Nomi that they will give Molly some money to keep quiet; their primary interest is in protecting their high-profile celebrity client, not in seeking justice for Molly. Zach then confronts Nomi with the truth he has just discovered: Nomi is actually a runaway and former prostitute named Polly Ann Costello; her father murdered her mother and then killed himself, and she has been arrested several times for drug possession, prostitution, and assault with a deadly weapon. Finally confronted with her seedy past, and frightened at who she has become and what lies ahead, Nomi decides to flee Las Vegas, but not before she pays a visit to Andrew Carver. Because Carver has made propositions to her from the moment he met her, Nomi has no problem inviting herself up to his hotel room. Once they are alone, she strips for him, but then pulls out a switchblade and swears that she will kill him if he makes a sound. She then proceeds to kick him repeatedly with her boots until he is bloodied and unconscious.

Later, Nomi bids goodbye to a semi-conscious Molly, informing her that she obtained some kind of vengeance for her. Nomi also visits the hospital room of Cristal, who doesn't seem particularly bitter about Nomi's stunt that she pulled. Cristal tells Nomi that she, too, got ahead by similar means. "There's always someone younger and hungrier than you coming down the stairs after you," Cristal says. Nomi says goodbye, but grants Cristal a passionate kiss before she leaves.

The movie comes full circle when Nomi coincidentally hitches a ride to Los Angeles with the very same guy who robbed her in the beginning, and attacks him for what he did to her, and both drive in the direction of LA.

==Reception==
''Showgirls''' subject matter was relatively controversial: [[rape]], [[lesbian]]ism, and [[interracial relationship]]s were just some of the topics explored. The film's gratuitous nudity, simulated sex, and $2 million screenplay<ref>Maureen Dowd, "Bucks and Blondes: Joe Eszterhas Lives The Big Dream", [[New York Times]], May 30, 1993.</ref> (written by [[Joe Eszterhas]], who had worked with director Paul Verhoeven before) did not lend itself to what might have been a provocative film. The 1998 film ''[[Burn Hollywood Burn]]'', also written by Eszterhas, contains a reference to ''Showgirls'' as a "terrible" film.

''Showgirls'' received a 14% positive on the film-critics Aggregate Site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that ''Showgirls'' received "some bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible".<ref>Ebert, Roger. "An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', February 27, 1998.</ref> Despite Ebert's views, the movie was heralded as [[List of films considered the worst|one of cinema's worst]], winning seven [[1995 Golden Raspberry Awards]] or "Razzies" (from a record 13 nominations). Verhoeven gamely appeared in person at the Razzies ceremony to accept his award for Worst Director; ''Showgirls'' would later win a record-setting eighth Razzie Award for Worst Picture of the Last Decade in 2000. 

Due to ''Showgirls''' poor reception, ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'', a 1996 film about nude dancers starring [[Demi Moore]], had to be distanced from ''Showgirls'' in advertisements;<ref>Nashawaty, Chris. "[http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,292286_7|23752||0_0_,00.html Demi Goes Undercover: Moore's 'Striptease' Bumps into Trouble]", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 04/26/96. Retrieved 16 August 2006</ref> ''Striptease'' nonetheless won the next year's Razzie Award for Worst Picture. Rena Riffel, who played Penny/Hope in ''Showgirls'', also was cast in ''Striptease'', as Tiffany Glass. 

The term "''Showgirls''-bad" has been adopted by film critics and fans to refer to films considered guilty pleasures, or "so-bad-they're-good".<ref>[http://www.porktartare.com/sight/sight_reviews.html Anonymous review of ''Catwoman'', PorkTartare.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=5&csid1=390 Anonymous review of ''Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows'' by Exclaim.ca]</ref><ref>[http://nymag.com/arts/all/features/16521/index.html Sternbergh, Adam. "Springtime for the Undulating Curve of Shifting Expectations!"] ''[[New York Magazine]]'' March 26, 2006</ref> To date ''Showgirls'' holds the honor of being the highest-grossing NC-17 production earning $20,350,754 at the North American Box Office.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/mpaa.htm?page=NC-17&p=.htm|title= Domestic Grosses by MPAA Rating - NC-17|accessdate= 2008-08-16|publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>

===Cult status===
Since its release, the movie has achieved [[cult classic|cult status]]. According to writer [[Naomi Klein]], [[irony|ironic]] enjoyment of the film initially arose among those with the video before MGM capitalized on the idea. MGM noticed the video was performing well because "trendy twenty-somethings were throwing ''Showgirls'' irony parties, laughing sardonically at the implausibly poor screenplay and shrieking with horror at the aerobic sexual encounters".<ref>[[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]], ''[[No Logo]]'', Vintage Canada Edition, 2000, p. 79.</ref>

''Showgirls'' is shown at [[midnight movie]]s alongside such films as ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''. It is heralded as one of the best "bad movies", a [[Camp (style)|camp]] classic in the vein of ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]''. Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100 million from video rentals <ref name="ReferenceA"/> and became one of [[MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070428172642/http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS - MGM's official page for Showgirls DVD-->]</ref>. 

The rights to show the movie on [[television|TV]] were eventually purchased by the [[VH1]] network. However, because of the film's rampant, gratuitous nudity, a [[censorship|censored]] version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed [[breast]]s and [[genitals]]. Also, several scenes were removed entirely. Berkley refused to redub her lines,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} so a noticeably different actress' voice can be heard on the soundtrack.

As revealed on the DVD release, a sign showing the distance to Los Angeles in the last shot of the film hinted at a sequel in which Nomi takes on Hollywood. 
The film was also ranked #36 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine's "The Top 50 Cult Movies list.<ref name= "EWCult">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 3, 2008 | url = http://www.filmsite.org/cultfilmsew2.html | accessdate = 2008-09-04 }}</ref>

Recent years have seen a reevaluation of the movie's merits. Critics such as [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] and [[Charles Taylor (film critic)|Charles Taylor]], as well as filmmaker [[Jacques Rivette]], have gone on the record defending ''Showgirls'' as a serious satire. Actor [[Patrick Bristow]], who plays choreographer Marty, defended the movie as "not that bad" except "that horrible rape scene."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} [[Quentin Tarantino]] has stated that he enjoyed ''Showgirls'', referring to it as the "only [...] other time in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation movie]]", comparing it to ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Udovitch |first=Mim |editor=Peary, Gerald |title=Quentin Tarantino: Interviews |year=1998 |publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi |isbn=1578060516 |chapter=Mim Udovitch/1996 |pages=172<U+2013>173 }}</ref>

''Showgirls'' has been compared to the 1950 film ''[[All About Eve (film)|All About Eve]]'' as a remake, update, or ripoff of that film.[http://www.jabootu.com/acolytes/brandiweed/showgirls.htm]

==Awards==
The film earned a record thirteen [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie]] nominations in 1996, and would take home a whopping seven awards<U+2014>a record later tied by ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' in 2001.  ''Showgirls'' would later win an eighth Razzie in 2000; ''Battlefield Earth'' would again tie this number in 2005.  (The single-year record of seven Razzies was broken when the film ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]'' won eight awards in 2008.)

==DVD releases==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:117136_s.jpg|left|thumb|Showgirls V.I.P. DVD Edition.]] -->In 2004, MGM released "The V.I.P. Edition"  of ''Showgirls'' in a special boxed set containing two shot glasses, movie cards with [[drinking game]]s on the back, a deck of playing cards, and a nude poster of Berkley with a pair of suction-cup [[pasties]] so viewers can play "pin the pasties on the showgirl."

The DVD itself includes several bonus features, including a "how-to" tutorial for giving a lapdance hosted by real strippers, and a special "trivia track" feature that can be turned on or off. When left on, it adds humorous comments and [[factoid]]s in the vein of VH1's ''[[Pop Up Video]]'' that relate to the scenes as they play out. It also includes "The Greatest Movie Ever Made: a commentary by [[David Schmader]]."

In 2007, MGM re-released the V.I.P. edition DVD without the physical extras.

On June 15, 2010, MGM released a 15th Anniversary "Sinsational Edition" in a two-disc dual-format Blu-ray/DVD edition<ref name= "Blu-ray">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Showgirls 15th Anniversary Blu-ray Announced | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = April 12, 2010 | url = http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=4424 | accessdate = 2010-04-12 }}</ref>. This edition contains most of the same bonus features as the VIP edition DVD, except the trivia text feature has been reformatted. The NC-17 edit of the film is used.

The trivia track on the 2010 edition contains some errors, such as a statement that some of the dancers featured in the film were recruited from the [[XFL]] football league cheerleaders, an impossibility as the XFL wasn't formed until 2000.
