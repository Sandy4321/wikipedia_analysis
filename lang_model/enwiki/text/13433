'''George Oliver Plunkett''' (1895<U+2013>1940) was an [[Irish Republican]] and a leading member of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] from 1916 to 1940, when he died on a [[hunger strike]] while [[interned]] in the [[Curragh]].<ref>p81, Michael Hopkinson, ''Frank Henderson's Easter Rising: Recollections of a Dublin Volunteer (Irish Narratives)'', Cork University Press, 1998</ref> He was the son of the [[Sinn Fein]] politician [[George Noble Plunkett]], a papal count and curator of the [[National Museum of Ireland|National Museum]], and the younger brother of [[Joseph Mary Plunkett]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[Chief of Staff]] who was executed after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].

==Early life==
George was born in 1895, probably in [[Dublin]] where his parents lived at the time. He was named after his father and his famous ancestor the [[Blessed]] [[Oliver Plunkett]], [[Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]], the last Catholic priest to be [[martyr]]ed in England and who was made a  [[saint]] in 1975. He was one of seven children, including; [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Mary]] (1887), Mona Maria (c1890), Geraldine (1892), George (1895) and John "Jack" (c1898). Like Joseph he was sent to be educated at the exclusive [[Stonyhurst College]], and is recorded there in the 1911 [[Census in the United Kingdom|England Census]].<ref>http://www.1911census.co.uk/search/results4.aspx?x=1390793183</ref>

==Easter Rising==
Although overshadowed by his elder brother [[Joseph Plunkett]], George was an important [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] man in his own right. He joined the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1914 and in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was a Captain and in command of the [[Kimmage]] Garrison, a band of draft-dodgers and men-on-the-run (including [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]) who stayed at his father's Larkfield estate in Kimmage, south of [[Dublin]] making bombs for the rising. Famously on [[Easter Monday]] he waved down a tram at with his revolver at [[Harold's Cross]] ordered his heavily-armed ruffians on board, took out his wallet and said "Fifty-two [[Tuppence|tuppenny]] tickets to the city centre please".<ref>p41, Michael McNally: Easter Rising 1916, ''Birth of the Irish Republic (Campaign 180)'', Osprey Publishing Ltd, 2007</ref> Arriving at [[Liberty Hall]] in style they marched with [[James Connolly]] and [[Patrick Pearse]] to seize Dublin's [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO). When Connolly gave the order to attack George shouted "Take the GPO" and charged in.<ref name="Barton-p206">p206, Brian Barton: ''From Behind a Closed Door: Secret Court Martial Records of the Easter Rising'', Blackstaff Press Ltd, 2005</ref> The GPO was the headquarters of the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the week-long Rising and George remained there throughout. At one point he risked being shot when he went to comfort a wounded British soldier, the enemy holding fire once they saw he was on a mission of mercy. 

He surrendered with his brother and the rest of the headquarters on Saturday 29 April, 1916. He was [[court-martial]]led with his brother Jack Plunkett on 4 May 1916 and both were sentenced to death by shooting, which was commuted to ten years penal servitude by Lt-Gen Sir [[John Maxwell]], who had ordered their brother [[Joseph Plunkett|Joseph's]] execution.<ref name="Barton-p206"/> His father and mother were also arrested and imprisoned. His sister Geraldine wrote;

<blockquote>
''"When the newspapers came out on Saturday the 6th (May 1916) we saw that George and Jack had also been sentenced to death and the sentence commuted to ten years. Jack told me afterwards that he had been told first of the death sentence and that the officer had then paused for a whole minute before telling him it had been commuted. Jack and George were brought to Mountjoy Jail for a few days, and then brought in a cattle boat to Holyhead. They spent six months in Portland Prison before being moved to Parkhurst, on the Isle of Wight. I got some South African medal ribbon because it was green, white and orange and made it into a bow which I wore everywhere. A big policeman in Dame Street stopped me and said the tricolour would get me into trouble. I said, 'I have one brother shot and two brothers sentenced to death and my father and mother in jail. He said 'You're Plunkett, you can wear it'."''<ref>http://www.aafarmar.ie/reviews.asp?titleID=123, Geraldine Plunkett Dillon, ''All in the Blood'', A&A Farmar Book Publishers, 2006</ref>

==Black and Tan War==
George was released due in the 1917 amnesty and returned to Ireland. He became a [[commandant]] in the IRA. On 20 October 1917, he addressed a huge [[Sinn Fein]] meeting in Dungarvan Square with his father and a Volunteer cavalry section as a [[guard of honour]]. As a member of IRA GHQ George travelled the county putting IRA volunteer companies on a proper war footing. The Irish War of Independence - the "[[Black and Tan]] War" - broke out when [[Eamon de Valera]] re-declared Irish Independence in 1919. On the night of 18<U+2013>19 March 1921 he commanded the IRA volunteers of the D<U+00E9>ise Brigade from West [[Waterford]]) and caught a British military convoy in the [[Burgery ambush]] two miles northeast of [[Dungarvan]]. The convoy included [[Black and Tans]] and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and after a firefight they were forced to retreat. An old flute-player arrived on the scene and refused to leave and followed the IRA to Kilgobinet, George said "Well, one thing he can say is that he saw the English running from the Irish".<ref name="O'Faol<U+00E1>in 2003">{{cite web

Pat Keating of the Comeragh was wounded and Geroeg went out under fire to help him, as he had done in the Easter Rising, and the IRA retreated to safety in the [[Comeragh Mountains]].

==Irish Civil War and After==
George sided with the IRA against the [[Irish Free State]] in the civil war and both he and Jack Plunkett fought at the [[Four Courts]] when the war began. They were captured and imprisoned again in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] where they went on hunger strike until George looked "like a death's head".<ref>pp149-153, Niamh O'Sullivan and Se<U+00E1>n O'Keeffe, ''Every Dark Hour: A History of Kilmainham Jail'', Liberties Press, 2007</ref> He was transferred to [[Mountjoy Prison]] and later in 1922 Judge Crowley ordered his release as his arrest was illegal under [[habeas corpus]]. In 1929 the rift between the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] was bridged for a period with the formation of Comhairle na Poblachta (Council for the Republic). In one body "were included [[Maud Gonne MacBride]]; solid [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] men like George Plunkett and [[Se<U+00E1>n MacBride]]; [[Mary MacSwiney]], [[JJ O'Kelly]] and the de jure Republicans; the Republican Left like [[Frank Ryan]] and [[Mick Fitzpatrick]]; firm Sinn F<U+00E9>in people like [[Joe Clarke]]..." This was only papering over the cracks and they soon split again. He was a member of the IRA Army Council and on 12 January 1939 was one of the seven signatures of the IRA's declaration of war on the United Kingdom in order to liberate [[Northern Ireland]]. This lead to the [[S-Plan]] bombing campaign of England in 1939-40 and George and Jack Plunkett being interned in the [[Curragh]]. They went on [[hunger strike]] and George died as a result in 1940, aged 45.
