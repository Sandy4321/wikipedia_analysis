'''Andrew Van De Kamp''' is a fictional character on the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. [[Shawn Pyfrom]] plays the sociopathic,<ref name "Greg"/> atheist, bisexual 19-year-old son of [[Bree Hodge|Bree Van De Kamp]] and the late [[Rex Van De Kamp|Rex Van De Kamp]]. 

Andrew first appeared in the pilot of Desperate Housewives and had a recurring role throughout Season 1 as Bree's increasingly delinquent son. Expelled from school and eventually sent to juvenile boot camp, Andrew is removed when he told his mother he was gay. Although he later admitted he "[[bisexual|liked both vanilla and chocolate]]", he also claimed he had originally said he was gay to get out of the camp. While Andrew has specified that technically he is bisexual, he refers to himself as gay in almost every instance. Nevertheless, he had seen how his mother reacted and believed that she would never accept him for who and what he was. This hurt Andrew so much he believed the only way to deal with it was to stop loving Bree first, so when she rejected him, it would not hurt so much. 

Andrew was made a regular character in Season 2, in which he deliberately set out to provoke Bree as far as he could. This backfired when, finally unable to cope, Bree abandoned him on the streets to fend for himself. Andrew returned home eight months later at [[Orson Hodge]]'s behest in Season 3, currently airing. He has so far only made small appearances. As one of the few LGBT teens on television secure with their sexuality, Andrew's storylines have been well received by gay groups. However, his attitude to his mother and various crimes have also garnered negative criticism. [[Marc Cherry]] has stated that this season Andrew will be a "changed man".<ref>Moylan, Brian, ([[September 15]], [[2006]]), [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2006/9-15/arts/feature/feature.cfm The good, the bad and the <U+2018>Ugly<U+2019>], Washington Blade.

Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp.

Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew be removed from the camp immediately, saying "Our son just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp.

===Season 2===

Set just weeks after Rex's death, Andrew's first opening shot in Season 2 is to claim Bree is incapable of having murdered his father because "it takes guts to kill somebody".<ref>Season 2, "[[You'll Never Get Away from Me]]", approx. 21:30.</ref> He resents [[George Williams (Desperate Housewives)|George Williams]] for dating Bree while Rex was still alive, and is very rude to him when he sees the two together.<ref>Season 2, "[[My Heart Belongs to Daddy (Desperate Housewives episode)|My Heart Belongs to Daddy]]", approx. 09:10.</ref> Bree blackmails Andrew with swim club subs into attending dinner with George.<ref>Season 2, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy", approx. 13:00.</ref> In response, Andrew imitates Bree's pleasure moan to provoke George, who tries to ground him but won't tell Bree why, and she refuses to punish Andrew without a reason.<ref>Season 2, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy", approx. 21:00.</ref> George decides to get rid of Andrew by kissing his mother during his swim meet, which so angers him he jumps out of the pool and attacks George.<ref>Season 2, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy", approx. 39:40.</ref> That evening, Andrew packs his bags for Camp Hennessey a second time.

[[Image:AndrewandJustininbed.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Andrew tries to provoke Bree as far as possible - including exhibiting his sexuality in front of her.]]
After George dies, Bree brings Andrew back from the camp, telling him that George killed Rex in order to marry her; Andrew is disgusted that his father is dead because of her.<ref>Season 2, "[[Coming Home (Desperate Housewives episode)|Coming Home]]", approx. 07:30.</ref> As a result, Andrew invites Justin to sleep over. He confides to him his reasons for hating Bree, saying: {{blockquote|Last year, when she found out that I liked guys, she freaked out. She said that, if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell. So, since I knew that I couldn't change, it suddenly hit me that, one day, my own mother was going to stop loving me. So, I decided to stop loving her first. That way, it wouldn't hurt so bad.<ref>Season 2, "Coming Home", approx. 24:30.</ref>}} He also confides his wish for his mother to slip up so that he can "take her down".<ref>Season 2, "Coming Home", approx. 25:10.</ref> Later, when Bree confesses to Andrew that George didn't commit suicide, he overdosed and asked her for an ambulance, and instead she sat down and waited for him to die, Andrew is provided with the "slip up" that he was waiting for.<ref>Season 2, "Coming Home", approx. 32:00.</ref>

How can you not love someone like that?<ref>Season 2, "Don't Look at Me", approx. 24:00.</ref>}} Bree persuades Justin to supply her with gay magazines and videos, which she plants among Andrew's things for his grandparents to find; they then leave Andrew behind, and revoke his trust fund.<ref>Season 2, "Don't Look at Me", approx. 36:10.</ref> In an attempt to make peace, Bree invites Justin to dinner.<ref>Season 2, "Don't Look at Me", approx. 38:40.</ref><br><br>

So, here we are. I was right. I..I win.<ref>Season 2, "I Know Things Now", approx. 37:30.</ref>}} Bree simply replies "Good for you", and drives away.

===Season 3===
[[Image:Andrewvandekampseason3.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Orson persuades Andrew to come home. He succeeds where Bree does not.]]

Eight months after the end of Season 2, Bree is about to leave for her honeymoon with [[Orson Hodge|Orson]] when she sees a news report on television about homeless teenagers, in which Andrew is interviewed.<ref>Season 3, "[[A Weekend In the Country (Desperate Housewives episode)|A Weekend In the Country]]", approx. 1:30.</ref> Horrified at what has happened to him, she cancels her honeymoon and sets out to retrieve Andrew, eventually finding him in a soup kitchen; she asks him to come back but he refuses.

I'm somebody else now", and runs.<ref>Season 3, "A Weekend In the Country", approx. 23:00.</ref> When Orson sees how guilty Bree feels, he finds Andrew himself and buys him lunch.<ref>Season 3, "A Weekend In the Country", approx. 33:10.</ref> During their conversation, Andrew admits he prostituted himself when desperate for money, and asks Orson not to tell his mother, before realising what he's said and correcting himself.<ref>Season 3, "A Weekend In the Country", approx. 37:20.</ref> Orson doesn't try to force Andrew to come home but instead points out that the reason he is living on the streets is to punish his mother, and ultimately he will only destroy himself.<ref>Season 3, "A Weekend In the Country", approx. 37:50.</ref> Andrew doesn't initially appear to heed this, but returns home the next day at the end of "[[A Weekend In the Country (Desperate Housewives episode)|A Weekend In the Country]]".<!--<ref>Season 3, "A Weekend In the Country", approx. 41:35.</ref> Don't need this ref.-->

Bree is delighted, but insists on concocting a reason for Andrew's long absence.<ref>Season 3, "[[Like It Was (Desperate Housewives episode)|Like It Was]]", approx. 3:10.</ref> Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted to see one of his former clients at a school science fair.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 15:50.</ref> Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 16:20.</ref> Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a previous client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 30:00.</ref> She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 31:00.</ref> Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instil moral values, "I mean, we know the difference between right and wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 35:30.</ref> Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off.<ref>Season 3, "Like It Was", approx. 36:40.</ref> Andrew has since got a job working at [[Tom Scavo|Tom's]] pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.<ref>Season 3, "[[I Remember That]]", approx. 15:20. </ref>

It is Andrew who convinces Austin to leave Fairview after he makes Danielle pregnant.<ref>Season 3, "[[The Little Things You Do Together]]", approx. 30:40. </ref>

==Characterization==

Andrew is partially based on writer [[Marc Cherry]] himself, who copied much of Bree's dialogue from his own mother's reaction when he came out to her.<ref>Keck, William, ([[April 14]], [[2005]]) [http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-04-14-housewives-van-de-kamps_x.htm A soapy coming-out party], USA today. Retrieved October 14, 2006.</ref> Andrew can be selfish and manipulative, and regularly uses other people to get what he wants, for example, persuading his boyfriend Justin to hit him so he can claim Bree is abusing him. He has also committed a range of crimes, from being expelled from school for smoking [[marijuana]], to [[Anything You Can Do (Desperate Housewives episode)|running over]] Mama Solis while drunk.<ref>Squires, Chase ([[April 23]], [[2005]]), [http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/23/Floridian/The_bad_boy_of_Wister.shtml The bad boy of Wisteria Lane], ''St. Petersburg Times''. Retrieved March 19, 2007.</ref> After Bree hushed up the accident for him, he then refused to feel bad, reasoning "She's an old lady! I have my whole life ahead of me!"<ref>Fashingbauer, Gael ([[February 10]], [[2006]]), [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11114374/ When two <U+2018>Wives<U+2019> go to war], MSNBC.com. Retrieved March 19, 2007.</ref> Marc Cherry has referred to him as being [[sociopathic]].<ref name "Greg"/> In Season 3, however, Andrew seems to have matured after spending eight months living on the streets.

While fans have heatedly debated his sexual orientation, Shawn Pyfrom has denied that Andrew is totally homosexual, implying he is bisexual.<ref>Stewart, Jenny, ([[2005]]) [http://www.gay.com/entertainment/news/?sernum=1016 "Desperate Housewives" keeps us guessing], Gay.com. Retrieved October 14, 2006.</ref> In "[[The Little Things You Do Together]]", he refers to Austin as a "dog" and himself as a "dog-lover". Whatever Andrew is, he is one of a few LGBT teens on television secure with his sexuality.<ref>Kennedy, John, ([[May 12]], [[2006]]), [http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=fdfbd8b1-fe7b-46d6-b2d0-ef67a0a2e166&k=54471||Kicked off Wisteria Lane], Canada.com. Retrieved October 14, 2006.</ref> March Cherry has commented, "[Andrew Van De Kamp] is perhaps the most empowered gay teen in the history of television. He's gay and he doesn't care."<ref>Los Angeles Daily News ([[February 21]], [[2007]]), [http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_09/page9.cfm Page containing quote at SGN.org]. Retrieved March 19, 2007.</ref>

From Andrew's hurt reaction to his mother's rejection of him, it appears that he deeply loves his mother, as his determination to hurt her in Season 2 is so he can "stop loving her first". He also loves and respects his father, and only Rex who can get him to stop tormenting Bree in Season 1, albeit briefly. Later on in Season 2, Carl, another strong male figure, has some similar success in forcing Andrew to stop harassing Bree temporarily. In Season 3, it is Orson, and not Bree, who persuades Andrew to return home and whom he continues to respect throughout the season.

==Critical reception==

As Andrew is a minor character in ''Desperate Housewives'', he is rarely mentioned by critics. However, his storylines have occasionally attracted press coverage. In 2005, when Andrew kisses his boyfriend Justin in "[[Impossible (Desperate Housewives episode)|Impossible]]", gay groups applauded a primetime television show willing to show a gay kiss in a romantic relationship; only six network television shows had done so in the past twenty years, as opposed to thirty for lesbian kisses.<ref>Warn, Sarah, ([[February 21]], [[2005]]), [http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2005/2/housewives2.html Desperate Housewives Outs Gay Teen With a Kiss (page 2)], afterelton.com.

Shawn Pyfrom has stated that he has received many letters from gay teens who have been encouraged by Andrew's ease with his sexuality as one of the few secure and confident [[LGBT]] teenage characters on television.<ref name="Canada">Kennedy, John, ([[May 12]], [[2006]]), [http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=fdfbd8b1-fe7b-46d6-b2d0-ef67a0a2e166&k=54471||Kicked off Wisteria Lane], Canada.com.
