The '''Roman Empire''' ({{lang-la|<small>IMPERIVM ROMANVM</small>}}) was the post-[[Roman Republic|Republican]] period of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman civilization]], characterised by an [[autocracy|autocratic]] form of government and large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]].<ref>"Roman Empire", Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008</ref> The 500-year-old Roman Republic, which preceded it, had been weakened through several [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]].{{#tag:ref|During the struggles of the Late Republic hundreds of senators were killed or died, and the [[Roman Senate]] had been refilled with supporters of the [[First Triumvirate]] and later those of the [[Second Triumvirate]].|group=nb}} Several events are commonly proposed to mark the transition from Republic to Empire, including [[Julius Caesar]]'s appointment as perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] (44&nbsp;BC), and the [[Battle of Actium]] ({{Nowrap|2 September}} 31&nbsp;BC), though the Roman Senate's granting to [[Octavian]] the [[honorific]] ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' is most common ({{Nowrap|16 January}} 27&nbsp;BC).{{#tag:ref|Octavian/Augustus officially proclaimed that he had saved the Roman Republic and carefully disguised his power under republican forms; [[consul]]s continued to be elected, [[tribune]]s of the plebeians continued to offer legislation, and senators still debated in the [[curia|Roman Curia]]. However, it was Octavian, and every effective emperor thereafter, who influenced everything and controlled the final decisions, and in final analysis, had the [[Roman legions|legions]] to back him up, if it ever became necessary.|group=nb}}

The first two centuries of the empire were characterized by the [[Pax Romana]], which was a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity.<ref>"Pax Romana". Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> Though Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the republic, it continued under the emperors. Notably, parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD, while Roman dominion in Europe, Africa and especially Asia was strengthened during this time. Numerous uprisings were successfully put down, notably those in Britain and Judea, though the latter uprising triggered the suicide of the unpopular [[Emperor Nero]] and a brief civil war.<ref>Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero. 49</ref> The empire would reach its greatest territorial extent under the emperor [[Trajan]] in 117 AD, though most of his gains were given up under his successor.<ref>Parker, Philip, "The Empire Stops Here". p.2.</ref> In the view of [[Dio Cassius]], a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor [[Commodus]] in 180 AD marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron"<ref>Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E. Cary</ref><U+2014>a famous comment which has led some historians, notably [[Edward Gibbon]], to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. Following the collapse of the troubled [[Severan dynasty]], the Roman Empire was engulfed by period of civil wars and social unrest termed the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].<ref>Brown, P., The World of Late Antiquity, London 1971, p. 22.</ref>

In the late third-century, the emperor [[Diocletian]] stabilized the empire and established the practice of dividing authority between four co-emperors (known as the [[tetrarchy]]).<ref>Potter, David. The Roman Empire at Bay. 296<U+2013>98.</ref> Disorder began again soon after his reign, but order was resorted by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who was the first emperor to convert to [[Christianity]] and who established the new capital of the eastern empire, [[Constantinople]]. During the following decades the empire was often divided along an East/West (Constantinople/Rome) axis. [[Theodosius&nbsp;I]] was the last emperor to rule over east and west, and died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.<ref>Chester G. Starr, ''A History of the Ancient World, Second Edition.''

''Asimov's Chronology of the World.'' Harper Collins, 1989. p. 110.</ref> The empire in the east (known today as the [[Byzantine Empire]] but referred to in its own day as simply the "Roman Empire") continued in various forms until 1453 with the death of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine&nbsp;XI]] and the [[Fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]] by [[Mehmed II]], leader of the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref>Asimov, p. 198.</ref>

Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed, particularly Europe, and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world.

==Government==
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire|Constitution of the Late Roman Empire|Executive Magistrates of the Roman Empire}}

===Emperor===
{{Main|Roman emperor}}
The powers of an emperor (his ''[[imperium]]'') existed, in theory at least, by virtue of his "tribunician powers" (''potestas tribunicia'') and his "proconsular powers" (''imperium proconsulare'').<ref name="Abbott, 342">Abbott, 342</ref> In theory, the tribunician powers (which were similar to those of the [[Plebeian Tribune]]s under the old republic) made the Emperor's person and office sacrosanct, and gave the Emperor authority over Rome's civil government, including the power to preside over and to control the Senate.<ref name="Abbott, 357">Abbott, 357</ref>

The proconsular powers (similar to those of military governors, or [[Proconsul]]s, under the old Republic) gave him authority over the Roman army. He was also given powers that, under the Republic, had been reserved for the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and the [[Roman assemblies|assemblies]], including the right to declare war, to ratify treaties, and to negotiate with foreign leaders.<ref name="Abbott, 345">Abbott, 345</ref>

The emperor also had the authority to carry out a range of duties that had been performed by the [[Roman Censors|censors]], including the power to control Senate membership.<ref name="Abbott, 354">Abbott, 354</ref> In addition, the emperor controlled the [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious institutions]], since, as emperor, he was always ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' and a member of each of the four major priesthoods.<ref name="Abbott, 345" /> While these distinctions were clearly defined during the early Empire, eventually they were lost, and the emperor's powers became less constitutional and more monarchical.<ref name="Abbott, 341">Abbott, 341</ref>

Realistically, the main support of an emperor's power and authority was the military. Being paid by the imperial treasury, the legionaries also swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor ''([[Sacramentum (oath)|sacramentum]])''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Roman Army|first=Adrian |last=Goldsworthy|chapter =The Life of a Roman Soldier|page=80|isbn=0-500-05124-0|year=2003|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London}}</ref>

The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but most emperors chose their own successors, usually a close family member. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his new status and authority in order to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the ''[[donativum]]'', a monetary reward.

===Senate===
{{Main|Senate of the Roman Empire}}
{{See also|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Curia Iulia.JPG|left|200px|thumb|upright|The [[Curia Julia]] in the [[Roman Forum]], the seat of the Senate]]
While the Roman assemblies continued to meet after the founding of the Empire, their powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate, and so senatorial decrees (''senatus consulta'') acquired the full force of law.<ref name="Abbott, 385">Abbott, 385</ref>

In theory, the Emperor and the Senate were two equal branches of government, but the actual authority of the Senate was negligible and it was largely a vehicle through which the Emperor disguised his autocratic powers under a cloak of republicanism. Although the Senate still commanded much prestige and respect, it was largely a glorified [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] institution. Stripped of most of its powers, the Senate was largely at the Emperor's mercy.

Many emperors showed a certain degree of respect towards this ancient institution, while others were notorious for ridiculing it. During Senate meetings, the Emperor sat between the two [[Roman Consul|consuls]],<ref name="Abbott, 383">Abbott, 383</ref> and usually acted as the presiding officer. Higher ranking senators spoke before lower ranking senators, although the Emperor could speak at any time.<ref name="Abbott, 383" /> By the 3rd century, the Senate had been reduced to a glorified municipal body.

===Senators and equestrians===
{{More|Equestrian order}}
No emperor could rule the Empire without the Senatorial order and the [[Equestrian order]]. Most of the more important posts and offices of the government were reserved for the members of these two aristocratic orders. It was from among their ranks that the provincial governors, legion commanders, and similar officials were chosen.

A senator had to be wealthy; one of the basic requirements was the wealth of 12,000 gold [[aureus|aurei]]<ref>Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#41 ''paragraph 41'']</ref> (about 100&nbsp;kg of gold), a figure which would later be raised with the passing of centuries. The career of a young aristocrat was influenced by his family connections and the favour of patrons. The son of a senator was expected to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', the "[[career ladder|career track]]", and the more prestigious positions were restricted to senators only.  As important as ability, knowledge, skill, or competence, patronage was considered vital for a successful career and the highest posts and offices required the Emperor's favour and trust.

Below the Senatorial order was the Equestrian order. The requirements and posts reserved for this class, while perhaps not so prestigious, were still very important. Some of the more vital posts, like the governorship of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] (Latin ''Aegyptus)'', were even forbidden to the members of the Senatorial order and available only to equestrians.

==Military==
{{Main|Military of ancient Rome|Roman army|Roman navy}}

 under [[Hadrian]] (ruled 117<U+2013>138) showing the location of the Roman legions deployed in AD 125.]]

===Legions===
During and after the civil war, Octavian reduced the huge number of the [[Roman legion|legions]] (over 60)<ref name="tcra50">''The complete Roman army'' by Adrian Goldsworthy, 2003 chapter ''The Army of the Principate'', p.50; ISBN 0-500-05124-0</ref> to a much more manageable and affordable size (28).<ref name="tcra50" /> Several legions, particularly those with doubtful loyalties, were simply disbanded. Other legions were amalgamated, a fact suggested by the title ''Gemina'' (Twin).<ref name="tcra50" />

In AD 9, Germanic tribes wiped out three full legions in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. This disastrous event reduced the number of the legions to 25. The total of the legions would later be increased again and for the next 300 years always be a little above or below 30.<ref>''The complete Roman army'' by Adrian Goldsworthy, 2005 chapter ''The Army of the Principate'', p.183; ISBN 0-500-05124-0</ref>

Augustus also created the [[Praetorian Guard]]: nine [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] ostensibly to maintain the public peace which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians also served less time; instead of serving the standard 25 years of the legionaries, they retired after 16 years of service.<ref>''Rome and her enemies'' published by Osprey, 2005 part 3 ''Early Empire 27BC&nbsp;<U+2014> AD 235'', chapter 9 ''The Romans'', section ''Remuneration'', p.183; ISBN 978-1-84603-336-0</ref>

===Auxilia===
While the [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxilia]] (Latin: ''auxilia'' = supports) are not as famous as the legionaries, they were of major importance. Unlike the legionaries, the auxilia were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with [[Roman citizenship]], also extended to their sons. According to [[Tacitus]]<ref>[[Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' IV.5</ref> there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries. Since at this time there were 25 legions of around 5,000 men each, the auxilia thus amounted to around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments.<ref>Goldsworthy (2003) 51</ref>

===Navy===
The [[Roman navy]] (Latin: ''Classis'', lit. "fleet") not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions, but also helped in the protection of the frontiers in the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. Another of its duties was the protection of the very important maritime trade routes against the threat of pirates. Therefore it patrolled the whole of the Mediterranean, parts of the [[Atlantic|North Atlantic]] (coasts of Hispania, Gaul, and Britannia), and also had a presence in the [[Black Sea]]. Nevertheless the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.<ref>''The complete Roman army'' by Adrian Goldsworthy 2003, chapter ''After Service'', p.114; ISBN 0-500-05124-0</ref>

==Provinces==
[[File:Baalbek-Bacchus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Bacchus]] in [[Baalbec]], [[Lebanon]]]]
{{Main|Roman province}}
Until the [[Tetrarchy]] (296 AD), Roman provinces (Latin ''provincae'') were administrative and territorial units of the Roman Empire outside of [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Under the Republic, provinces had been administered by former consuls and [[praetor]]s,<ref name="paragraph 47">Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augusts [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#47 ''paragraph 47'']</ref> that is, by the senatorial order. Some provinces continued as [[senatorial province]]s under the Empire. Due to their location, away from the borders, and to the fact that they were under established Roman sovereignty and control, these provinces were largely peaceful and stable. Only a single legion was based in a Senatorial province: [[Legio&nbsp;III Augusta]], stationed in the Senatorial province of [[Africa Province|Africa]] (modern northern Algeria). 

Augustus created [[Imperial province]]s.<ref name="paragraph 47" /> Most, but not all, of the Imperial provinces were relatively recent conquests and located at the borders. The bulk of  the legions were stationed at the frontiers ''([[limes]])'' and under direct Imperial control.

The [[Egypt (Roman province)|Imperial province of Egypt]] was crucial to the Empire as its major "[[breadbasket]]" and for the [[grain supply to the city of Rome]]. Egypt was considered the personal province of the Emperor, and Senators were forbidden even to visit. The governor of Egypt and the commanders of any legion stationed there were chosen by the Emperor from the equestrian order.

The status of a province was subject to change; it could change from Senatorial to Imperial, or vice-versa. This happened several times <ref name="paragraph 47"/> during Augustus' reign. Another trend was to create new provinces, mostly by dividing older ones, or by expanding the Empire.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Persecution of religion in ancient Rome}}
[[File:Rome Pantheon.JPG|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the present structure built during [[Hadrian]]'s reign, was dedicated to the worship of all Roman deities.]]
As the Empire expanded, and came to include people from a variety of cultures, the worship of an ever increasing number of [[deity|deities]] was tolerated and accepted. The Imperial government, and the Romans in general, tended to be very tolerant towards most religions and cults, so long as they did not cause trouble. This could easily be accepted by other faiths as Roman liturgy and ceremonies were frequently tailored to fit local culture and identity. Since the Romans practiced polytheism they were also able to easily assimilate the gods of the peoples the Empire conquered.<ref name="early christian art">{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Allen|title=Early Christian Art: An Introduction|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Early-Christian-Art-An-Introduction.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> An individual could attend to both the Roman gods representing his Roman identity and his own personal religion, which was considered part of his personal identity. There were periodic persecutions of various religions at various points in time, most notably that of Christians.

===Imperial cult===
In an effort to enhance loyalty, the inhabitants of the Empire were called to participate in the [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] to revere (usually deceased) emperors as [[demigod]]s.<ref>See also Harland, P. A., "Honours and Worship: Emperors, Imperial Cults and Associations at Ephesus (First to Third Centuries C.E.)", Studies in Religion/Sciences religieuses 25 (1996) 319<U+2013>334.</ref> Few emperors claimed to be Gods while living, the exceptions being emperors who were widely regarded at the time to be insane (such as [[Caligula]]). Doing so in the early Empire would have risked revealing the shallowness of what the Emperor [[Augustus]] called the "restored Republic" and would have had a decidedly eastern quality to it. Since the tool was mostly one the Emperor used to control his subjects, its usefulness would have been greatest in the chaotic later Empire, when the emperors were often Christians and unwilling to participate in the practice.<ref name="ReferenceA">Fishwick, Vol 3, 1, 42: see also Plutarch (based on Varro, Quaestionaes Romanae, 14</ref>

Usually, an emperor was deified after his death by his successor in an attempt by that successor to enhance his own prestige. This practice can be misunderstood, however, since "deification" was to the ancient world what canonization is to the Christian world. Likewise, the term "god" had a different context in the ancient world.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This could be seen during the years of the [[Roman Republic]] with religio-political practices such as the disbanding of a Senate session if it was believed the gods disapproved of the session or wished a particular vote. Deification was one of the many honors a dead emperor was entitled to, as the Romans (more than modern societies) placed great prestige on honors and national recognitions.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The importance of the Imperial cult slowly grew, reaching its peak during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. Especially in the eastern half of the Empire, imperial cults grew very popular. As such it was one of the major agents of [[romanization (cultural)|romanization]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The central elements of the cult complex were, apart from a temple; a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]] or [[amphitheatre]] for gladiator displays and other games and a [[Thermae|public bath complex]]. Sometimes the imperial cult was added to the cults of an existing temple or celebrated in a special hall in the bath complex.

===Absorption of foreign cults===
Since Roman religion did not have a core belief that excluded other religions, several foreign gods and cults became popular. The worship of [[Cybele]] was the earliest, introduced from around 200&nbsp;BC.<ref>Beard, Mary, The Roman and the Foreign: The Cult of the 'Great Mother' in Imperial Rome, in Nicholas Thomas and Caroline Humphrey, eds., Shamanism, History, and the State (Ann Arbor, University of Michigan, 1994) pp. 168</ref> [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] were introduced from Egypt a century later. [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and [[Sol Invictus]] were quite important and [[Mithras]] became very popular with the military.<ref>In Greek "both votary and god are called Bacchus." Burkert, Greek Religion 1985:162. For the initiate as Bacchus, see Euripides, Bacchantes 491. For the god, who alone is Dionysus, see Sophocles Oedipus the King 211 and Euripides Hippolytus 560.</ref> Several of these were [[Mystery cult]]s. In the 1st century BC [[Julius Caesar]] granted Jews the freedom to worship in Rome as a reward for their help in Alexandria.<ref>David W. J. Gill, ''The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting'', p.467, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1994</ref>

===Religious conflicts===
====Druids====
[[Druid]]s were considered as essentially non-Roman: a prescript of [[Augustus]] forbade Roman citizens to practice "druidical" rites. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]] xxx.4.</ref> that under [[Tiberius]] the druids were suppressed<U+2014>along with diviners and physicians<U+2014>by a decree of the Senate, and [[Claudius]] forbade their rites completely in AD&nbsp;54.<ref name="paragraph 25">Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 ''paragraph 25'']</ref>

[[File:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Relief from the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome depicting a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] and other spoils from the Temple of Jerusalem carried in [[Roman triumph|triumph]]]]
====Judaism====
While Judaism was largely accepted, as long as Jews paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish Tax]] after AD 70, there was [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire|anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire]]<ref>Christine Shepardson, Anti-Judaism and Christian Orthodoxy, p.23, CUA Press, 2008</ref> and there were several [[Jewish-Roman wars]]<ref>Flavius Josephus, The Great Roman-Jewish War, Courier Dover Publications, 2004</ref>.

The ''Crisis under [[Caligula]]'' (AD 37<U+2013>41) has been proposed as the "first open break between Rome and the Jews", even though problems were already evident during the [[Census of Quirinius]] in AD 6 and under [[Sejanus]] (before AD 31).<ref>H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256: "The reign of Gaius Caligula (37-41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the [[Julio-Claudian]] empire. Until then&mdash;if one accepts [[Sejanus]]' heyday and the trouble caused by the [[Census of Quirinius|census after Archelaus' banishment]]&mdash;there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire&nbsp;... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides.&nbsp;... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]].&nbsp;... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]]."</ref>

Until the rebellion in Judea in AD&nbsp;66, Jews were generally protected. To get around Roman laws banning secret societies and to allow their freedom of worship, Julius Caesar declared Synagogues were colleges. Tiberius<ref>Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#36 ''paragraph 36'']</ref> forbade Judaism in Rome but they quickly returned to their former protected status. Claudius expelled Jews from the city; however, the passage of Suetonius is ambiguous: "Because the Jews at Rome caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus he [Claudius] expelled them from the city."<ref name="paragraph 25"/> ''Chrestus'' has been identified as another form of ''Christus''; the disturbances may have been related to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|arrival of the first Christians]], and that the Roman authorities, failing to distinguish between the Jews and the early Christians, simply decided to expel them all.

Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between [[Christianity and Judaism|Christians and Jews]] prior to Nerva's modification of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]] in 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax; Christians did not.<ref>Wylen, Stephen M., ''The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction'', Paulist Press (1995), ISBN 0-8091-3610-4, Pp 190<U+2013>192.; Dunn, James D.G., ''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D.&nbsp;70 to 135'', Wm.

[[Christianity]] emerged in [[Iudaea Province|Roman Judea]] as a [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish religious sect]] in the 1st century AD. The religion gradually spread out of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], initially establishing major bases in first [[Antioch]], then [[Alexandria]], and over time throughout the Empire as well as beyond.  

At first, imperial authorities viewed Christianity as a Jewish sect rather than a distinct religion. No emperor issued general laws against the faith or its Church, and persecutions, such as they were, were carried out under the authority of local government officials.<ref>Graeme Clarke, "Third-Century Christianity," in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 616; W.H.C.

[[Suetonius]] mentions in passing that during the reign of [[Nero]] "punishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous [[Religion in ancient Rome#Superstitio|superstition]]" ''(superstitionis novae ac maleficae)''.<ref>Suetonius, ''Life of Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#16 16.2]: ''afflicti suppliciis Christiani, genus hominum superstitionis novae ac maleficae.''</ref> He gives no reason for the punishment.

One of the earliest persecutions occurred in [[Gaul]] at [[Persecution in Lyon|Lyon in 177]]. Persecution was often local and sporadic, and some Christians welcomed [[Christian martyr|martyrdom as a testament of faith]].<ref>Entry on "martyrdom," ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 411f.</ref> The [[Decian persecution]] (246<U+2013>251) was a serious threat to the Church, but while it potentially undermined the religious hierarchy in urban centers, ultimately  it served to strengthen Christian defiance.<ref>W.H.C.

[[Constantine&nbsp;I]] (sole ruler 324<U+2013>337) became the first Christian emperor, and in 380 [[Theodosius&nbsp;I]] established Christianity as the official religion.

By the 5th century Christian hegemony had rapidly changed the Empire's identity even as the Western provinces collapsed.<ref>Ekelund, Robert Burton; H<U+00E9>bert, Robert F.: ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=FP08EXnwP3YC The Marketplace of Christianity]'', pg. 60, The MIT Press, Nov. 2006, ISBN 978-0-262-05082-1</ref> Those who practiced the traditional polytheistic religions were persecuted, as were Christians regarded  as heretics by the authorities in power.

The language of Rome before its expansion was [[Latin]], and this became the empire's official language. By the time of the imperial period Latin had developed two [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]: the "high" written [[Classical Latin]] and the "low" spoken [[Vulgar Latin]]. While Classical Latin remained relatively stable, even through the [[Middle Ages]], Vulgar Latin as with any spoken language was fluid and evolving. Vulgar Latin became the [[lingua franca]] in the western provinces, later evolving into the modern [[Romance languages]]: [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], etc. Greek and Classical Latin were the languages of literature, scholarship, and education.

Although Latin remained the most widely spoken language in the West, through to the [[fall of Rome]] and for some centuries afterwards, in the East the [[Greek language]] was the literary language and the lingua franca.<ref>Fergus Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire: Power and Belief under Theodosius&nbsp;II (408<U+2013>450)''. Sather Classical Lectures, Vol. 64. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006. Pp. 279.

They generally left established customs in place and only gradually introduced typical Roman cultural elements including the Latin language.<ref name="Freeman1">Freeman (1999), pp.389<U+2013>433</ref> Along with Greek, many other languages of different tribes were used but almost without expression in writing.

Greek was already widely spoken in many cities in the east, and as such, the Romans were quite content to retain it as an administrative language there rather than impede bureaucratic efficiency. Hence, two official secretaries served in the Roman Imperial court, one charged with correspondence in Latin and the other with correspondence in Greek for the East.<ref name="Lee">Lee I.

ISBN 0-521-22989-8</ref> This further spreading of "Hellenistic" culture (and therefore language) was largely due to the extensive infrastructure (in the form of entertainment, health, and education amenities, and extensive transportation networks, etc.) put in place by the Romans and their tolerance of, and inclusion of, other cultures, a characteristic which set them apart from the xenophobic nature of the Greeks preceding them.<ref name="Freeman1"/>

Since the Roman annexation of Greece in 146 BC, the Greek language gradually obtained a unique place in the Roman world, owing initially to the large number of Greek slaves in Roman households.<ref name="Freeman1"/> In Rome itself Greek became the second language of the educated elite.<ref name="Freeman1"/><ref>McDonnell/MacDonnell, ''Roman Manliness: Virtus and the Roman Republic''{{Verify credibility|date=January 2008}}</ref> It became the common language in the early [[Christian Church|Church]] (as its major centers in the early Christian period were in the East), and the language of scholarship and the arts.

However, due to the presence of other widely spoken languages in the densely populated east, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] (which was also extensively spoken in North Africa), Greek never took as strong a hold beyond Asia Minor (some urban enclaves notwithstanding) as Latin eventually did in the west. This is partly evident in the extent to which the derivative languages are spoken today. Like Latin, the language gained a [[Diglossia|dual nature]] with the literary language, an [[Attic Greek]] variant, existing alongside spoken language, [[Koine Greek]], which evolved into [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] or Byzantine Greek (Romaic).<ref>''Greek Language'', [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9366082/Greek ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'']</ref>

By the 4th century AD, Greek no longer held such dominance over Latin in the arts and sciences as it had previously, resulting to a great extent from the growth of the western provinces. This was true also of Christian literature, reflected, for example, in the publication in the early 5th century AD of the [[Vulgate|Vulgate Bible]], the first officially accepted Latin [[Bible]]. As the Western Empire [[Decline of the Roman Empire|declined]], the number of people who spoke both Greek and Latin declined as well, contributing greatly to the future [[Eastern Europe|East]]<U+2013>[[Western Europe|West]] / [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]<U+2013>[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] cultural divide in Europe.

Important as both languages were, today the [[Romance language|descendants of Latin]] are widely spoken in many parts of the world, while the Greek dialects are limited mostly to Greece, [[Cyprus]], and small enclaves in [[Turkey]] and [[Southern Italy]] (where the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] retained control for several more centuries). To some degree this can be attributed to the fact that the western provinces fell mainly to "Latinised" [[Germanic Christianity|Christian]] tribes whereas the eastern provinces fell to Muslim Arabs and Turks for whom Greek held less cultural significance.
<!--The major languages of the Roman Empire were [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Greek was the long established [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean and very important in the eastern provinces, while the influence of Latin was stronger in the western provinces and there it slowly gained in importance. The imperial bureaucracy worked in both languages, and two official secretaries<ref name="Lee" /> dealt with the correspondence, in Greek for the eastern provinces, and in Latin for the western provinces.

By the time of the imperial period Latin had evolved [[diglossia|into two languages]]: the 'high' written [[Classical Latin]] and the 'low' spoken [[Vulgar Latin]]. While Classical Latin remained relatively stable, Vulgar Latin was, as with any spoken language, continually fluid and slowly evolving. Greek had also evolved into [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Koine Greek]]. Greek and Classical Latin were considered the languages of literature, scholarship, and education. One of the passages of ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' even tells us that, as a barbarian addressed emperor [[Claudius]] in both Greek and in Latin, the reply of the emperor began with: "''Since you come armed with both our languages...''".<ref>Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', Life of Claudius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#42 ''paragraph 42'']</ref> Claudius is also the last known person to study and to write [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] which seems to have died out in the 1st century AD.

Nearly all educated persons in the East could speak Greek, just as all educated persons in the West spoke Latin and Greek, but a great proportion of ordinary people spoke neither. In the enormous and multi-ethnic empire many other languages were spoken, some even gaining local official status during some periods. [[Aramaic language#Late Old Western Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] were spoken in certain eastern provinces and, in addition to Greek, became accepted literary languages used by the local elite. Also important were [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] in Armenia, while [[Punic language|Punic]] seems to have entered a period of slow decline. Hard knowledge about the various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] dialects and languages is sadly lacking.-->

Life in the Roman Empire revolved around the city of Rome, and its famed [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city also had several [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]],<ref>Jones, Mark Wilson ''Principles of Roman Architecture.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.</ref> [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]], and many [[tavern]]s, [[Thermae|baths]] and [[brothel]]s. Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]], and in the [[capital city]] of Rome, to the residences on the elegant [[Palatine Hill]], from which the word "''palace''" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city centre, packed into apartment blocks.

Most Roman towns and cities had a [[Roman Forum|forum]] and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. [[Aqueduct (Roman)|Aqueducts]] were built to bring water to urban centres<ref name="Kevin Greene, "Technological Innovation and Economic Progress in the Ancient World: M.I.

Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed a large numbers of slaves. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the [[Roman villa|villas]].

Many aspects of Roman culture were taken from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].<ref name="Scott, 404">Scott, 404</ref> In [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]], the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the [[arch]] and the [[dome]].

The centre of the early social structure was the family,<ref name="Abbott, 1">Abbott, 1</ref> which was not only marked by [[bloodline|blood relations]] but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas.<ref name="Abbott, 2">Abbott, 2</ref> The [[Pater familias]] was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death.<ref name="Abbott, 6">Abbott, 6</ref> Originally, only patrician aristocracy enjoyed the privilege of forming familial clans, or ''gens'', as legal entities; later, in the wake of political struggles and warfare, clients were also enlisted. Thus, such plebian ''gentes'' were the first formed, imitating their patrician counterparts.<ref>''Social History of Rome'' By G<U+00E9>za Alf<U+00F6>ldy, David Braund, 1985</ref>

[[Slavery]] and slaves were part of the social order; there were [[slave trade|slave markets]] where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally [[mutilation]] and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/slavery_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Resisting Slavery in Ancient Rome|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dl.ket.org/latinlit/mores/slaves/|title=Slavery in Ancient Rome|accessdate=2008-06-20|'''publisher=Kentucky Educational Television}}</ref> Professor Gerhard Rempel from the [[Western New England College]] claims that in the city of Rome alone, during the Empire, there were about 400,000 slaves.<ref>[http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc1/lectures/12romanday.html The Romans at Work and Play].

The city of Rome had a place called the [[Campus Martius]] ("Field of Mars"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[racing]]. [[equestrianism|Riding]], throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities.<ref name="austin-roman1">Austin, Roland G. "Roman Board Games. I", ''Greece & Rome'' 4:10, October 1934. pp. 24<U+2013>34.</ref>

In the countryside, pastimes also included fishing and hunting. [[Board game]]s played in Rome included [[Dice]] (Tesserae or [[Venus Throw|Tali]]), Roman Chess ([[Ludus latrunculorum|Latrunculi]]), Roman [[Draughts|Checkers]] (Calculi), [[Tic-tac-toe]] (Terni Lapilli), and [[Ludus duodecim scriptorum]] and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon.<ref name="austin-roman1"/> There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, as well as musical and theatrical performances.

The ''toga picta'' was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The ''toga pulla'' was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status: patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. Men typically wore a [[toga]], and women a [[stola]]. The woman's ''stola'' looked different from a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The Romans also invented [[socks]] for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals.<ref name="Romans' crimes of fashion revealed"/>

In the later empire after [[Diocletian]]'s reforms, clothing worn by soldiers and non-military government bureaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, ''clavi'', and circular roundels, ''orbiculi'', added to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements usually consisted of geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures.<ref>Sumner and D'Amato, G. and R. (2002).

Romans had simple food habits. Staple food was simple, generally consumed at around 11 o'clock, and consisted of bread, salad, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat left over from the dinner the night before. The Roman poet, [[Horace]] mentions another Roman favourite, the [[olive]], in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "As for me, olives, [[endive]]s, and smooth [[Althaea (genus)|mallows]] provide sustenance."<ref>"Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea levesque malvae." Horace, ''Odes 1.31.15'', ca 30 BC</ref> The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table. Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups.

Wine was considered a staple drink,<ref name="Phillips pg 46-56">Phillips pp 46<U+2013>56</ref> consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite cheap. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for [[alcoholism]], whose debilitating physical and psychological effects were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals.

Roman literature was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest works we possess are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the empire expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. [[Virgil]] represents the pinnacle of Roman epic poetry. His ''[[Aeneid]]'' tells the story of flight of Aeneas from [[Troy]] and his settlement of the city that would become Rome. The genre of satire was common in Rome, and satires were written by, among others, [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]]<ref>[[Lucilius]]<U+2014>the acknowledged originator of Roman Satire in the form practiced by Juvenal<U+2014>experimented with other meters before settling on dactylic hexameter.</ref> and [[Persius]]. Many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists. Portrait sculpture<ref>{{cite journal |last=Toynbee |first=J. M. C. |year=1971 |month=December |title=Roman Art |journal=The Classical Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=439<U+2013>442 |accessdate= 2007-12-11 |doi=10.1017/S0009840X00221331 |jstor=708631}}</ref> during the period utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. Advancements were also made in relief sculptures, often depicting Roman victories.

Music was a major part of everyday life. The word itself derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''<U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE>'' (''mousike''), "(art) of the [[Muses]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891|title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus}}</ref> Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and maneuvers. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.

Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the [[civil engineering]] and building [[construction]] [[technology]] became developed and refined. The [[Roman concrete]] has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently.<ref>W. L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire, rev. ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1982, fig. 131B; Lechtman and Hobbs "Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution"</ref> The architectural style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centres under Roman control and influence.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Ancient Rome}}
Following various military conquests in the [[Greek East]], Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own system.<ref name="Legacy">The Legacy of Roman Education (in the Forum), Nanette R. Pacal, The Classical Journal, Vol. 79, No. 4. (Apr.<U+2013>May 1984)</ref> Home was often the learning centre, where children were taught [[Roman law]], [[convention (norm)|customs]], and physical training to prepare the boys for eventual recruitment into the [[Roman army]]. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction<ref name = "Ox"/> from their mothers in the art of [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[weaving]], and [[sewing]].

Education nominally began at the age of six. During the next six to seven years, both boys and girls were taught the basics of [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[arithmetic]]. From the age of twelve, they would be learning [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[grammar]] and [[literature]], followed by training for [[public speaking]]. [[Eloquence|Oratory]] was an art to be practised and learnt, and good orators commanded respect. To become an effective orator was one of the objectives of [[education]] and [[learning]]. In some cases, services of gifted slaves were utilized for imparting education.<ref name="Ox">Oxford Classical Dictionary, Edited by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, Third Edition.

===Currency===

{{Main|Roman currency|Roman Imperial currency}}
The imperial government was, as all governments, interested in the issue and control of the currency in circulation. To mint coins was an important political act: the image of the ruling emperor appeared on most issues, and coins were a means of showing his image throughout the empire. Also featured were predecessors, empresses, other family members, and [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]]. By issuing coins with the image of an heir his legitimacy and future succession was proclaimed and reinforced. Political messages and imperial propaganda such as proclamations of victory and acknowledgements of loyalty also appeared in certain issues.

Legally only the emperor and the Senate had the authority to mint coins inside the empire.<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/antiquities/coins/roman_coins.html USASK.ca]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> However the authority of the Senate was mainly in name only. In general, the imperial government issued gold and silver coins while the Senate issued bronze coins marked by the legend '''''"SC"''''', short for ''Senatus Consulto'' "by decree of the Senate". However, bronze coinage could be struck without this legend. Some Greek cities were allowed to mint<ref>[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/begin4.html Dougsmith.ancients.info]</ref> bronze and certain silver coins, which today are known as ''Greek Imperials'' (also ''Roman Colonials'' or ''Roman Provincials''). The imperial mints were under the control of a chief financial minister, and the provincial mints were under the control of the imperial provincial procurators. The Senatorial mints were governed by officials of the Senatorial treasury.

[[Augustus|Octavian]], the grandnephew and heir of [[Julius Caesar]], had made himself a central military figure during the chaotic period following Caesar's assassination. In 43 BC at the age of twenty he held his first [[Roman consul|consul]]ship and became one of the three members of the [[Second Triumvirate]], a political alliance with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], and [[Mark Antony]].<ref>Eck, Werner; translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider; new material by Sarolta A. Tak<U+00E1>cs. (2003) The Age of Augustus. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p12</ref> In 36 BC, he was given the power of a [[Plebeian Tribune]], which gave him veto power over the Senate and the ability to control the [[Plebeian Council]], the principal legislative assembly. These powers made himself and his position [[sacrosanct]]. The triumvirate ended in 32&nbsp;BC, torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members: Lepidus was forced into exile and Antony, who had allied himself with his lover Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], committed suicide in 30&nbsp;BC following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] (31 BC) by the fleet of Octavian commanded by his general [[Agrippa]]. Octavian subsequently annexed Egypt to the empire.<ref>Paul K. Davis, 100 Decisive Battles from Ancient Times to the Present: The World<U+2019>s Major Battles and How They Shaped History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 63.</ref>

Now sole ruler of Rome, Octavian began a full-scale reformation of military, fiscal and political matters. In 29&nbsp;BC, he was given the authority of a [[Roman Censor]] and thus the power to appoint new senators.<ref name="Abbott, 267">Abbott, 267</ref> The senate also granted him a unique grade of [[Proconsul]]ar ''imperium'', giving him authority over all proconsuls, the military governors of the Empire.<ref name="Abbott, 269">Abbott, 269</ref> The powers had he now secured for himself were in effect those that his predecessor Julius Caesar had secured for himself years earlier as [[Roman Dictator]].

The provinces at the frontiers where the vast majority of legions were stationed, newly classified as [[imperial provinces]], were now under the control of Octavian. The peaceful provinces were given to the authority of the Senate and were classified as [[senatorial provinces]].<ref>Eck, Werner; translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider; new material by Sarolta A. Tak<U+00E1>cs. (2003) The Age of Augustus. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. p40</ref> The legions, which had reached an unprecedented number of around fifty because of the civil wars, were concentrated and reduced to twenty-eight. Octavian also created nine special [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] to maintain peace in Italy, keeping at least three stationed in Rome. The cohorts in the capital became known as the [[Praetorian Guard]].

In 27 BC, Octavian offered to transfer control of the state back to the [[Roman senate|senate]].<ref name="Abbott, 267" /> The Senate refused the offer, which in effect was a ratification of his position within the state. Octavian was also granted the title of "Augustus" by the Senate,<ref name="Abbott, 268">Abbott, 268</ref> and took the title of ''[[Princeps]]'' or "first citizen".<ref name="Abbott, 269" /> As the adopted heir of Julius Caesar, Octavian, now referred to as "Augustus", took ''Caesar'' as a component of his name. By the time of the reign of [[Vespasian]], the term ''Caesar'' had evolved from a family name into a [[Caesar (title)|formal title]].

Augustus completed the conquest of [[Hispania]], while subordinate generals expanded Roman possessions in [[Africa Province|Africa]] and [[Asia Minor]]. Augustus' final task was to ensure an orderly succession of his powers. His greatest general and stepson [[Tiberius]] had conquered [[Pannonia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Raetia]], and temporarily [[Germania]] for the Empire, and was thus a prime candidate. In 6&nbsp;BC, Augustus granted tribunician powers to his stepson,<ref name="Abbott, 272">Abbott, 272</ref> and soon after he recognized Tiberius as his heir. In 13&nbsp;AD, a law was passed which extended Augustus' powers over the provinces to Tiberius,<ref name="Abbott, 273">Abbott, 273</ref> so that Tiberius' legal powers were equivalent to, and independent from, those of Augustus.<ref name="Abbott, 273" /> In 14&nbsp;AD Augustus died at the age of seventy-five, having ruled the empire for forty years.

====Julio-Claudian dynasty====
{{Main|Julio-Claudian dynasty}}
[[File:Caligula RIC 0033.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Caligula on a [[sestertius]] (37<U+2013>38 AD), with the reverse depicting his three sisters [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], [[Julia Drusilla|Drusilla]], and [[Julia Livilla]] as the divine personifications [[Securitas]], [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]], and [[Fortuna]]]]

Augustus was succeeded by his stepson Tiberius, the son of his wife [[Livia]] from her first marriage. Augustus was a scion of the ''[[gens]] [[Julius|Julia]]'' (the Julian family), one of the most ancient [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] clans of [[ancient Rome|Rome]], while Tiberius was a scion of the ''[[Claudius (gens)|gens Claudia]]''. Their three immediate successors were all descended from the ''gens Claudia'', through Tiberius's brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. They also descended from the ''gens Julia'', emperors [[Caligula]] and [[Nero]] through [[Julia the Elder]], Augustus's daughter from his first marriage, and emperor [[Claudius]] through Augustus's sister [[Octavia Minor]]. Historians refer to their dynasty as the "[[Julio-Claudian Dynasty]]".<ref>Brill's New Pauly, "Julio-Claudian emperors"</ref>

The early years of Tiberius's reign were relatively peaceful. However, his rule soon became characterized by paranoia. He began a series of treason trials and executions, which continued until his death in 37.<ref>Pliny the Elder, Natural Histories XXVIII.5.23.</ref> The logical successor to the much hated Tiberius was his 24-year-old grandnephew Caligula. Caligula's reign began well, but after an illness he became tyrannical and insane. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the senate debated the merits of restoring the Republic.<ref name="Abbott, 293">Abbott, 293</ref>

Due to the demands of the army, however, Claudius was ultimately declared emperor. Claudius was neither paranoid like his uncle Tiberius, nor insane like his nephew Caligula, and was therefore able to administer the Empire with reasonable ability. Claudius ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine,<ref name="nameOfRomeP269">Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 269</ref> setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction.<ref name="luttwakP38">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 38</ref> In his own family life he was less successful, as he married his niece, who may very well have poisoned him in 54.<ref>Scramuzza, Vincent (1940). The Emperor Claudius Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p29</ref>

Nero, who succeeded Claudius, focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade, and increasing the cultural capital of the Empire. Nero, though, is remembered as a tyrant, and was forced to commit suicide in 68.

====Military emperors====
{{Campaignbox Year of the Four Emperors}}

Nero was followed by a brief period of civil war, known as the "[[Year of the Four Emperors]]". Augustus had established a standing army, where individual soldiers served under the same military governors over an extended period of time. The consequence was that the soldiers in the provinces developed a degree of loyalty to their commanders, which they did not have for the emperor. Thus the Empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have disintegrated at any time.<ref name="Abbott, 296">Abbott, 296</ref> Between {{Nowrap|June 68}} and {{Nowrap|December 69}}, Rome witnessed the successive rise and fall of [[Galba]], [[Otho]] and [[Vitellius]] until the final accession of [[Vespasian]], first ruler of the [[Flavian dynasty]]. These events showed that any successful general could legitimately claim a right to the throne.<ref name="Abbott, 298">Abbott, 298</ref>

[[File:Roman Colosseum With Moon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vespasian]] commissioned the [[Colosseum]] in Rome.]]
In AD 69, [[Marcus Salvius Otho]] had the Emperor [[Galba]] murdered<ref>Tacitus, ''The Histories'', Book 1, ch. 41</ref><ref>Plutarch, ''Lives'', Galba</ref> and claimed the throne for himself,<ref name="luttwakP51">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 51</ref><ref name="classicalworldP542">Lane Fox, ''The Classical World'', p. 542</ref> but [[Vitellius]] had also claimed the throne.<ref>Tacitus, ''The Histories'', Book 1, ch. 57</ref><ref name="livesotho">Plutarch, ''Lives'', Otho</ref> Otho left Rome, and met Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]],<ref name="grandstrategyP52">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 52</ref> after which the Othonian troops fled back to their camp,<ref>Tacitus, ''The Histories'', Book 1, ch. 44</ref> and the next day surrendered to the Vitellian forces.<ref>Tacitus, ''The Histories'', Book 1, ch. 49</ref> Meanwhile, the forces stationed in the Middle East provinces of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] and [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] had acclaimed [[Vespasian]] as emperor.<ref name="grandstrategyP52"/> The armies of Vespasian and Vitellius met in the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum]],<ref name="grandstrategyP52"/><ref>Tactitus, ''The Histories'', Book 3, ch. 18</ref> after which the Vitellian troops were driven back into their camp.<ref>Tactitus, ''The Histories'', Book 3, ch. 25</ref> Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, was declared emperor.

Vespasian, though a successful emperor, continued the weakening of the Senate which had been going on since the reign of Tiberius. Through his sound fiscal policy, he was able to build up a surplus in the treasury, and began construction on the [[Colosseum]]. [[Titus]], Vespasian's successor, quickly proved his merit, although his short reign was marked by disaster, including the eruption of Mount [[Vesuvius]] in [[Pompeii]]. He held the opening ceremonies in the still unfinished Colosseum, but died in 81. His brother [[Domitian]] succeeded him. Having exceedingly poor relations with the Senate, Domitian was murdered in September 96.

====Nerva-Antonine dynasty====
[[File:Colonnatraiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Forum of Trajan]], [[Trajan's Column]], and the [[Basilica Ulpia]]]]
The next century came to be known as the period of the "[[Nerva<U+2013>Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]", in which the successions were peaceful and the Empire was prosperous. Each emperor of this period was adopted by his predecessor. The last two of the "Five Good Emperors" and Commodus are also called [[Antonines]].<ref>McKay, John P.; Hill, Bennett D.; Buckler, John; Ebrey, Patricia B.; & Beck, Roger B. (2007)</ref> After his accession, [[Nerva]], who succeeded Domitian, set a new tone: he restored much confiscated property and involved the Senate in his rule.
Starting in the year 101, [[Trajan]] undertook two military campaigns against gold-rich [[Dacia]], which he finally conquered in 106 (see [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]]).<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 322</ref><ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 213</ref><ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 215</ref> Following an uncertain number of battles, Trajan marched into Dacia,<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 222</ref> besieged the Dacian capital and razed it to the ground.<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 223</ref> With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently [[Roman-Parthian Wars#Roman Empire vs Parthia|invaded the Parthian empire]] to the east. In 112, Trajan marched on [[Armenia]] and annexed it to the Roman Empire. Then he turned south into [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], taking several cities before declaring [[Mesopotamia]] a new province of the Empire, and lamenting that he was too old to follow in the steps of [[Alexander the Great]]. During his rule, the Roman Empire expanded to its largest extent, and would never again advance so far to the east.<ref>Nelson, Eric (2002). Idiots guide to the Roman Empire.. Alpha Books. pp. 207<U+2013>209. ISBN 0-02-864151-5.</ref>

[[Hadrian]]'s reign was marked by a general lack of major military conflicts, but he had to defend the vast territories that Trajan had acquired.

[[Antoninus Pius]]'s reign was comparatively peaceful.<ref>Bury, J. B. A History of the Roman Empire from its Foundation to the Death of Marcus Aurelius. p525</ref> During the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]], Germanic tribes launched many raids along the northern border. The period of the "Five Good Emperors", also commonly described as the [[Pax Romana]] ("Roman Peace") was brought to an end by the reign of [[Commodus]]. Commodus was the son of Marcus Aurelius, breaking the scheme of adoptive successors that had turned out so well. Commodus became paranoid and slipped into insanity before being murdered in 192.<ref>Dio Cassius 72.36.4.</ref>

====Severan dynasty====
The [[Severan Dynasty]], which lasted from 193 until 235, included several increasingly troubled reigns.<ref>Simon Swain, Stephen Harrison and Jas Elsner (eds), Severan culture (Cambridge, CUP, 2007).</ref> A generally successful ruler, [[Septimius Severus]], the first of the dynasty, cultivated the [[Roman army|army]]'s support and substituted equestrian officers for senators in key administrative positions.<ref>Birley, Anthony R. (1999) [1971]. Septimius Severus: The African Emperor. London: Routledge. p113.</ref> In 197, he waged a brief and successful war against the Parthian Empire, during which time the Parthian capital was sacked, and the northern half of Mesopotamia was restored to Rome.

[[File:Severus210AD.png|thumb|left|Extent of the empire in 210 AD, during the reign of Septimius Severus]]
Severus' successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while. Most notably, he extended full Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire. In 217, Caracalla marched on Parthia from Edessa.<ref name="historyP279">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 279</ref> Increasingly unstable and autocratic, Caracalla was assassinated while on the march by [[Macrinus]],<ref>"Caracalla" The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary.

In 230, the first Sassanid emperor attacked Roman territory,<ref name="grandStrategyP151"/>

[[Alexander Severus]], the last of the dynasty, was proclaimed emperor, but was unable to control the army and was assassinated in 235.<ref>Dio, 60:20:2</ref><ref name="declineP130"/> His murderers raised in his place [[Maximinus Thrax]], who was in turn murdered<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', p. 131</ref> when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the senatorial candidate for the throne, [[Gordian&nbsp;III]].

===Crisis of the Third Century===
{{Main|Crisis of the Third Century|Diocletian|Tetrarchy}}
in 243, Gordian's army defeated the Sassanids at the [[Battle of Resaena]].<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 235</ref> His own fate is not certain, although he may have been murdered by his successor, [[Philip the Arab]], who ruled for only a few years before the army proclaimed another general as emperor, this time [[Decius]], who defeated Philip and seized the throne.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', p. 135</ref> [[Gallienus]], emperor from AD 260 to 268, saw a [[Gallienus usurpers|remarkable array of usurpers]].

A military that was often willing to support its commander over its emperor meant that commanders could establish sole control of the army they were responsible for and usurp the imperial throne. The so-called [[Crisis of the Third Century]] describes the turmoil of murder, usurpation and in-fighting that is traditionally seen as developing after the murder of Alexander Severus in 235.<ref name="grantP280">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 280</ref> During the near-collapse of the Roman Empire between 235 and 284, 25 emperors reigned, and the empire experienced extreme military, political, and economic crises.

[[File:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Relief from a 3rd-century sarcophagus depicting a battle between Romans and Germanic warriors; the central figure is perhaps the emperor [[Hostilian]] (d. 251)]]
The essential problem of large tribal groups on the frontier remained much the same as the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries; the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat. Some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 146</ref><ref>Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 282</ref> The assembled warbands of the Alamanni frequently crossed the border, attacking Germania Superior such that they were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory did not come until 268. In that year the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the [[Goths]], from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the end result of a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', p. 624</ref> The Alamanni seized the opportunity to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer and then routed in the [[Battle of Naissus]].<ref name="historyP285">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 285</ref> The Goths remained a major threat to the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat.

The Alamanni on the other hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They defeated [[Aurelian]] at the [[Battle of Placentia (271)|Battle of Placentia]] in 271 but were beaten back for a short time, only to reemerge fifty years later. The core problems would remain and cause the eventual destruction of the western empire.

===Tetrarchy===
[[File:Venice <U+2013> The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''The Tetrarchs'', a [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] sculpture [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked]] from a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] palace in 1204, Treasury of [[Mark the Evangelist|St Mark's]], [[Venice]]]]

The accession of [[Diocletian]], who reigned from 284 until 305, marks the end of the period conventionally known as the Crisis of the Third Century. Diocletian was able to address many of the acute problems experienced during this crisis, including a treaty in 297 with [[Narseh]] that produced a peace between Rome and the Sassanid Empire that lasted until 337.

Diocletian, a usurper himself, defeated [[Carinus]] to become emperor.  Diocletian saw the vast empire as ungovernable, and therefore split the Roman Empire in half and created two equal emperors to rule under the title of [[Augustus (honorific)|''Augustus'']]. In doing so, he effectively created what would become the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. In 293 authority was further divided, as each ''Augustus'' took a junior Emperor called a [[Caesar (title)|''Caesar'']] to provide a line of succession. This constituted what is now known as the Tetrarchy ("rule of four").  Some small measure of stability again returned, with the empire split into a tetrarchy of two greater and two lesser emperors, a system that staved off civil wars for a short time until AD 312. The transitions of this period mark the beginnings of [[Late Antiquity]].<ref>Glen W. Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 49.8 (May 1996:29-43) p 34</ref>

===Constantinian dynasty===
The Tetrarchy effectively collapsed with the death of [[Constantius Chlorus]], the first of the [[Constantinian dynasty]], in 306. Constantius's troops immediately proclaimed his son [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] as ''Augustus''. A series of civil wars broke out, which ended with the entire empire being united under Constantine. In 312, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good. Constantine legalised Christianity definitively in 313 through the ''[[Edict of Milan]]''.<ref>Potter, David Stone, The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180-395, Routledge, 2004. p334.</ref>From AD&nbsp;314 onwards, he defeated Licinius in a series of battles. Constantine then turned to Maxentius, beating him in the [[Battle of Verona (312)|Battle of Verona]] and the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]]. 

[[File:ConstantineEmpire.png|thumb|left|The Roman Empire in 337 AD during the reign of Constantine the Great.]]
Just before the death of [[Constantine&nbsp;I]] in 337, [[Shapur&nbsp;II]] broke the peace and renewed what would become a twenty-six-year conflict with the Sassanid Empire, attempting with little success to conquer Roman fortresses in the region. 

In 361, after further episodes of civil war, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] became emperor. His [[edict]] of toleration in 362 ordered the reopening of pagan [[Temple (Roman)|temples]], and, more problematically for the [[Christian Church]], the recalling of previously exiled Christian [[bishop]]s. Julian eventually resumed the war against [[Shapur&nbsp;II]] of Persia, although he received a mortal wound at the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] and died in 363. The Romans were victorious but were unable to take the city and were forced to retreat. There were several later wars.<ref>Gibbon. "Decline and Fall" chapter 23</ref> Julian's officers then elected [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] as emperor. Jovian ceded territories won from the Persians as far back as [[Trajan]]'s time, and restored the privileges of Christianity, before dying in 364.

===Valentinian dynasty===
[[Image:Solidus Valens.jpg||thumb|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] issued by Valens (ca. 376), with reverse depicting Valens and his brother Valentinian I holding jointly the [[Sovereign's Orb|orb]] representing global power]]

Upon Jovian's death, [[Valentinian I]], the first of the [[Valentinian dynasty]], was elected Augustus, and chose his brother [[Valens]] to serve as his co-emperor.<ref>Kulikowski, M. Rome's Gothic Wars: from the third century to Alaric. 2007. pg 162</ref> In 365, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] managed to bribe two [[Roman legion|legions]], who then proclaimed him Augustus. War between the two rival Eastern Roman Emperors continued until Procopius was defeated, although in 367, eight-year-old [[Gratian]] was proclaimed emperor by the other two. In 375 Valentinian&nbsp;I led his army in a campaign against a [[Germanic tribes|Germanic tribe]], but died shortly thereafter. Succession did not go as planned. Gratian was then a 16-year-old and arguably ready to act as Emperor, but the troops proclaimed his infant half-brother emperor under the title [[Valentinian&nbsp;II]], and Gratian acquiesced.<ref>Theodosian Code 16.10.20; Symmachus Relationes 1<U+2013>3; Ambrose Epistles 17<U+2013>18.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its own problems with Germanic tribes. One tribe fled their former lands and sought refuge in the Eastern Roman Empire. Valens let them settle on the southern bank of the Danube in 376, but they soon revolted against their Roman hosts. Valens personally led a campaign against them in 378.<ref name="ReferenceB">Ammianus Marcellinus, Historiae, book 31, chapters 12<U+2013>14.</ref> However this campaign proved disastrous for the Romans. The two armies approached each other near [[Adrianople]], but Valens was apparently overconfident of the numerical superiority of his own forces over the enemy. Valens, eager to have all of the glory for himself, rushed into battle, and on {{Nowrap|9 August}} 378, the Goths inflicted a crushing defeat on the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]], resulting also in the death of Valens.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 378  on the Eastern Empire at the [[Battle of Adrianople]].<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31.</ref><ref>Jordanes, ''The Origins and Deeds of the Goths'', 138.</ref> Contemporary historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] estimated that two-thirds of the Roman soldiers on the field were lost. The battle had far-reaching consequences, as veteran soldiers and valuable administrators were among the heavy casualties, which left the Empire with the problem of finding suitable leadership. Gratian was now effectively responsible for the whole of the Empire. He sought however a replacement Augustus for the Eastern Roman Empire, and in 379 chose [[Theodosius&nbsp;I]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Theodosian dynasty===
[[File:Theodosius-1-.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodosius I, as depicted on the ''[[Missorium of Theodosius I|Missorium Theodosii]]'' (388 AD)]]
Theodosius, the founder of the [[Theodosian dynasty]], proclaimed his five-year-old son [[Arcadius]] an Augustus in 383 in an attempt to secure succession. [[Hispanic]] [[Celt]] general [[Magnus Maximus]], stationed in [[Roman Britain]], was proclaimed Augustus by his troops in 383 and rebelled against Gratian when he invaded [[Gaul]]. Gratian fled, but was assassinated. Following Gratian's death, Maximus had to deal with Valentinian&nbsp;II, at the time only twelve years old, as the senior Augustus. Maximus soon entered negotiations with Valentinian&nbsp;II and Theodosius, attempting and ultimately failing to gain their official recognition. Theodosius campaigned west in 388 and was victorious against Maximus, who was captured and executed. In 392 [[Valentinian&nbsp;II]] was murdered, and shortly thereafter [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]] arranged for the appointment of [[Eugenius]] as emperor.<ref>Williams, Stephen and Gerard Friell, Theodosius: The Empire at Bay, Yale University Press, 1994. p134.</ref>

The eastern emperor Theodosius I refused to recognise Eugenius as emperor and invaded the West again, defeating and killing Arbogast and Eugenius. He thus reunited the entire Roman Empire under his rule. Theodosius was the last Emperor who ruled over the whole Empire. As emperor, he made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire.<ref>Edict of Thessolonica": See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2</ref> After his death in 395, he gave the two halves of the Empire to his two sons Arcadius and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. The Roman state would continue to have two different emperors with different seats of power throughout the 5th century, though the Eastern Romans considered themselves Roman in full. The two halves were nominally, culturally and historically, if not politically, the same state.

===Fall of the Western Roman Empire (395<U+2013>476)===
{{Main|Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Decline of the Roman Empire|Migration Period}}
[[File:Roman Empire 460 AD.png|thumb|right|310px|The Roman Empire in 460 during the reigns of Majorian ''(west)'' and Leo I ''(east)''.]]
After 395, the emperors in the [[Western Roman Empire]] were usually figureheads, while the actual rulers were military strongmen. In 475 Orestes had revolted against Emperor [[Julius Nepos]], causing him to flee to Dalmatia.<ref>Ensslin, Wilhelm, <U+201C>Julius Nepos<U+201D>, in Paulys Realencyclop<U+00E4>die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Band XVI,2 (1935), S. 1505<U+2013>1510.</ref> Orestes then proclaimed his own son Romulus Augustus to be emperor, but could not get sanction from the Eastern Empire nor homage from scattered remnants of the Western Empire outside Italy (which was under his immediate military control.)  A few months later, in 476 Orestes refused to honor his promises to the [[Foederati]], (Germanic mercenaries in the service of the empire) who had supported his revolt against Nepos, for lands in Italy. The dissatisfied mercenaries, led by [[Odoacer]], revolted, killing Orestes and removing Romulus Augustus. Odoacer ruled Italy as a king and refused imperial titulature, so the year 476 is generally used to mark the end of the Western Roman Empire.<ref>Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned over Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind." Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XXXVI</ref>

Odoacer quickly conquered the remaining provinces of Italy, and was greeted as a liberator by the Roman Senate. Eastern Roman Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] soon received two deputations. One was from the Senate; it returned the Imperial regalia and requested that the division of the empire should be formally abolished and Zeno should reign alone, endorsing Odoacer's governance of Italy. The second deputation was from Nepos, asking for military support to regain control of the Italian Peninsula.<ref>Malchus, fragment 10, translated in C.D. Gordon, The Age of Attila, pp. 127-129</ref> Zeno declined to abolish the Western Empire, but acceded to the requests to legitimize Odoacer's rule, naming him ''patrician.'' He urged Odoacer and the Senate, however, to recognize Nepos' authority and invite him to return to Italy. Nepos was not invited back, but Odoacer was careful to observe the formalities of the exiled emperor's titular status, often invoking his name and even minting coins with his image. Upon Nepos' death in 480, Zeno claimed Dalmatia for the East, but Odoacer, claiming his duty as vassal to arrest and punish the killers of the Western Emperor, invaded and took control of the country. He also did try and execute the assassins. When Odoacer supported the revolt of [[Illus]] and Leonitus (484-488), Zeno responded by declaring his own menacing ally [[Theodoric the Great]], [[Ostrogoths]], to be King of Italy.  Theodoric invaded, crushed Odoacer, and took possession of Italy in 489.

The Empire became gradually less Romanised and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigothic assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than by foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself "King of Italy" instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman<U+2014>it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476.

The Roman people were by the 5th century "bereft of their military ethos"<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 285</ref> and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf. Many theories have been advanced in explanation of the decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century<ref>Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 361</ref> to the fall of Constantinople in 1453.<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 231</ref>

Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point. Disagreement persists since the decline of the Empire had been a long and gradual process rather than a single event.

===Eastern Roman Empire (476<U+2013>1453)===
{{Main|Byzantine Empire}}
[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|The entry of [[Ottoman sultan|Turkish sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] into [[Constantinople]], by the Italian painter [[Fausto Zonaro]] (1854<U+2013>1929)]]
As the Western Roman Empire declined during the 5th century, the richer Eastern Roman Empire would be relieved of much destruction, and in the mid 6th century the Eastern Roman Empire (generally today called the Byzantine Empire) under the emperor [[Justinian&nbsp;I]] reconquered Italy and parts of [[Illyria]] from the [[Ostrogoths]], North Africa from the [[Vandals]], and southern [[Hispania]] from the [[Visigoths]]. The reconquest of southern Hispania was somewhat ephemeral, but North Africa served the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] for another century, parts of Italy for another five centuries, and parts of Illyria even longer.

Of the many accepted dates for the end of the classical Roman state, the latest is 610. This is when the Emperor [[Heraclius]] made sweeping reforms, forever changing the face of the empire. Greek was readopted as the language of government and Latin influence waned. By 610, the Eastern Roman Empire had come under definite Greek influence, and could be considered to have become what many modern historians now call the Byzantine Empire.  However, the Empire was never called thus by its inhabitants, who used terms such as ''Romania'', ''Basileia Romaion'' or ''Pragmata Romaion'', meaning "Land of the Romans" or "Kingdom of the Romans", and who still saw themselves as Romans, and their state as the rightful continuation of the ancient empire of Rome.

During the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century, the Empire lost its possessions in Africa and the [[Levant]] to the Arab-Islamic [[Caliphate]], reducing Byzantine lands to [[Anatolia]], the [[Balkans]] and southern Italy. The [[sack of Constantinople]] at the hands of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 is sometimes used to date the end of Eastern Roman Empire: the destruction of Constantinople and most of its ancient treasures, total discontinuity of leadership, and the division of its lands into rival states with a Catholic-controlled "Emperor" in Constantinople itself was a blow from which the Empire never fully recovered.

Nevertheless, the Byzantines recovered Constantinople itself and reestablished the Empire in 1261, and continued to call themselves Romans until their fall to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. That year the eastern part of the Roman Empire was ultimately ended by the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. Even though [[Mehmed&nbsp;II]], the conqueror of Constantinople, declared himself the Emperor of the Roman Empire (''Caesar of Rome / Kayser-i Rum''), and even though this capture was in some ways far less catastrophic than the sack, [[Constantine&nbsp;XI]] is usually considered the last Roman Emperor. The Greek ethnic self-descriptive name "[[Romios|Rhomios]]" (''Roman'') survives to this day.

{{Main|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}
The American magazine ''National Geographic ''described the legacy of the Roman Empire in ''The World According to Rome'':
{{quote|The enduring Roman influence is reflected pervasively in contemporary language, literature, legal codes, government, architecture, engineering, medicine, sports, arts, etc. Much of it is so deeply embedded that we barely notice our debt to ancient Rome. Consider language, for example. Fewer and fewer people today claim to know Latin <U+2014> and yet, go back to the first sentence in this paragraph. If we removed all the words drawn directly from Latin, that sentence would read; "The."<ref>Reid (1997), p. 54.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The final statement is not entirely accurate (in terms of the linguistic etymology): many words with Latin roots, such as ''engineering'' and ''sports'', were borrowed from French<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=engineer |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sport |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref> and were thus derived indirectly, while the main verb and the preposition in the first sentence are native English (Germanic) forms, though with close Latin parallels (''est'', ''in'') due to shared [[Indo-European]] history. However, the point pertaining to the pervading influence is valid.|group=nb}} }}

Several states claimed to be the Roman Empire's successors after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The [[Holy Roman Empire]], an attempt to resurrect the Empire in the West, was established in 800 when [[Pope Leo&nbsp;III]] crowned [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Charlemagne]] as [[Roman Emperor]] on [[Christmas Day]], though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalised for some decades. After the fall of [[Constantinople]], the [[Muscovy|Russian Tsardom]], as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] tradition, counted itself the [[Third Rome]] (Constantinople having been the second). These concepts are known as [[Translatio imperii]].

When the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, [[Mehmed&nbsp;II]] established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire. He even went so far as to launch an invasion of Italy with the purpose of "re-uniting the Empire", although [[Papal States|Papal]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] armies stopped his march on Rome at [[Otranto]] in 1480. Constantinople was not officially renamed [[Istanbul]] until {{Nowrap|28 March}} 1930.

Excluding these states claiming its heritage, if the traditional date for the founding of Rome is accepted as fact, the Roman state can be said to have lasted in some form from 753&nbsp;BC to the fall in 1461 of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] (a successor state and fragment of the Byzantine Empire which escaped conquest by the Ottomans in 1453), for a total of 2,214 years. The Roman impact on Western and Eastern civilisations lives on. In time most of the Roman achievements were duplicated by later civilisations. For example, the technology for [[cement]] was rediscovered 1755<U+2013>1759 by [[John Smeaton]].

The Empire contributed many things to the world, such as a calendar with [[leap year]]s, the institutions of Christianity and aspects of modern [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classicistic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]]. The extensive system of roads that was constructed by the [[Roman Army]] lasts to this day. Because of this network of roads, the time necessary to travel between destinations in Europe did not decrease until the 19th century, when steam power was invented. Even modern [[astrology]] comes to us directly from the Romans.

The Roman Empire also contributed its form of government, which influences various constitutions including those of most European countries and many former European colonies. In the United States, for example, the framers of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] remarked, in creating the [[Presidency]], that they wanted to inaugurate an "Augustan Age". The modern world also inherited legal thinking from [[Roman law]], fully codified in [[Late Antiquity]]. Governing a vast territory, the Romans developed the science of [[public administration]] to an extent never before conceived or necessary, creating an extensive civil service and formalised methods of tax collection.

While in the West the term "Roman" acquired a new meaning in connection with the church and the [[Pope]] of Rome the Greek form [[Romaioi]] remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and is still used by [[Greeks]] in addition to their common appellation.<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, History of Europe, The Romans, 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

The Roman Empire's territorial legacy of controlling the Italian peninsula would serve as an influence to [[Italian nationalism]] and the unification (''[[Risorgimento]]'') of Italy in 1861.
