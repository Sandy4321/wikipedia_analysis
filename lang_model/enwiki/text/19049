'''Lambir Hills National Park''' is situated near [[Miri]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]], on the island of [[Borneo]]. It is a small park, composed largely of mixed dipterocarp forest. A census of all trees in a 52 hectare plot found 1175 different species. The forest has many birds and small mammal species, but large mammals such as gibbon and sun bear are absent or very rare due to the size of the forest and illegal hunting.
