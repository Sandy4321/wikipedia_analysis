The '''Turban Head eagle''', also known as the '''Capped Bust eagle''', was a ten-dollar gold piece, or [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]], struck by the [[United States Mint]] from 1795 to 1804. The piece was designed by [[Robert Scot]], and was the first design in the eagle series, which would continue until the Mint ceased striking gold coins for circulation in 1933.  The common name is a misnomer; [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] does not wear a turban but a cap, believed by some to be a ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'' or Liberty cap: her hair twisting around the headgear makes it appear to be a turban.

The eagle was the largest denomination authorized by the [[Coinage Act of 1792]], which established the Mint.  It was not struck until 1795, as the Mint first struck copper and silver coins.  The number of stars on the obverse was initially intended to track the number of states in the Union, but that idea was eventually abandoned in favor of using 13 stars in honor of the original states.  The initial reverse, featuring an eagle with a wreath in its mouth, proved unpopular and was replaced by a heraldic eagle.

Increases in the price of gold made it profitable for the coins to be melted for their gold content, and in 1804, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] ended coinage of eagles<U+2014>the denomination would not again be struck for circulation for a third of a century.  Four 1804-dated eagles were struck in 1834 as part of sets of US coins to be given to foreign potentates.  These differ from the eagles struck for circulation dated 1804, and are among the most valuable US coins.
==Inception==
In 1791, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a resolution authorizing President [[George Washington]] to establish a mint.  Feeling that the action was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive act which would govern the new facility.  The result was the [[Coinage Act of 1792]], pursuant to which the highest denomination authorized to be struck was the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.<ref>Albanese, pp. 54<U+2013>55.</ref>

The passage of the Coinage Act was followed by the establishment of the Mint; by 1793, it was striking cents and half cents.<ref>Hobson, p. 113.</ref>  Coinage of precious metal pieces was delayed; Congress had required that the assayer and chief coiner each post a security bond of $10,000, a huge sum in those days.  In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner's bond to $5,000 and the assayer's to $1,000, and President Washington's appointees to those positions were able to qualify and take office.  Silver coinage began that year.<ref>Lange, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref>

The first deposit of gold to be struck into coins was made at the Mint in February 1795.<ref>Albanese, p. 61.</ref>  Around May 1795, the first Mint director, [[David Rittenhouse]] set engraver [[Robert Scot]] the task of preparing dies for an issue of gold coins.<ref name = "b512">Breen, p. 512.</ref>  Before the work came to fruition, Rittenhouse resigned in June, and was replaced by [[Henry deSaussure]].  The new director took office on July 9, 1795, and pressed to have the gold coin project completed with great speed.<ref name = "al"/>  DeSaussure also publicized that the Mint would be striking gold pieces, the new nation's first.<ref name = "b512"/>  The first [[half eagle]]s (five-dollar pieces) were struck 22 days later. <ref name = "al"/> Coinage of eagles followed shortly afterwards, although the exact date is uncertain. <ref name = "al"/>  The dies for the eagle are believed to have been prepared by Scot and by longtime Mint employee [[Adam Eckfeldt]].<ref name = "breen"/>

The first eagles were struck from gold supplied in part by the [[Bank of Pennsylvania]].<ref name = "breen"/>  There is a legend that Washington provided the gold for the first 400 eagles, though numismatic author Dean Albanese deems the tale unlikely:  holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in unproductive cash.  Albanese suggests, though, that the fact that many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear means that Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to give to dignitaries.<ref name = "al">Albanese, pp. 57<U+2013>59.</ref>

==Design==
[[File:Gilbert Stuart 002.jpg|thumb|left|This woman, painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]] around 1793, wears a [[mob cap]].]] 
The three designs for the Turban Head eagle<U+2014>the obverse and the two reverses<U+2014>are all by Scot.  They are identical to designs used on other silver and gold coins of the period, the more so since the Mint did not yet put denominations on gold pieces.<ref>Albanese, pp. 60<U+2013>61.</ref>  The origin of Scot's obverse is uncertain.  Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]] suggests a similarity between Scot's portrayal of Liberty on the eagle and the portrait on the [[1792 half disme]] (deemed by some the first Federal coinage), and speculates that the ultimate inspiration may have been [[Martha Washington]], the President's wife.<ref name = "v35">Vermeule, p. 35.</ref>  He also contends that a bust should have drapery only if intended as part of a statue: "Greco-Roman classicism has been misunderstood here".<ref name ="v35">Vermeule, p. 35.</ref> Numismatic historian [[Walter Breen]] believes that probably Scot "copied some unlocated contemporaneous engraving of a Roman copy of a Hellenistic goddess, altering the hair, adding drapery and an oversize soft cap".<ref name = "b512"/>  Breen disputes Vermeule's belief that the cap is a ''pileus'', the hat given to emancipated slaves as a symbol of their freedom.   In support of that position, he reproduces an 1825 letter from then-Mint Director [[Samuel Moore (congressman)|Samuel Moore]], stating that the cap on the gold coins was "not the Liberty cap in form, but probably conforming to the fashionable dress of the day".<ref>Breen, pp. 518<U+2013>519.</ref>  Numismatic author David Lange contends the headgear is a [[mob cap]], much in fashion at the time.<ref>Lange, p. 18.</ref>

The reverse which appeared on the eagle from 1795 to mid-1797 depicts an eagle perched on a branch, and clutching a victory wreath, surrounded by the nation's name.<ref>Albanese, p. 61.</ref>  Vermeule contends that the appearance of the bird is "difficult to describe" but that it has "a healthy individuality and an almost-rustic charm".<ref name = "v35"/>  Breen suggests that the branch is from a palm tree, and that this is in tribute to deSaussure, a [[South Carolina|South Carolinian]].<ref name = "b544">Breen, p. 544.</ref>  The reverse coined beginning in 1797 featured a heraldic eagle based on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].  Breen points to what he deems a blunder on Scot's part:  the bird holds both arrows and an olive branch, but carries the arrows in the dexter, or dominant right claw, symbolizing a preference for war over peace.<ref>Breen, p. 545.</ref>

==Production==
The first eagles were struck in August and September 1795; 1,097 eagles were made available for circulation on September 22.  Four hundred of these were immediately paid out to the Bank of Pennsylvania.  One piece was put aside for the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.  Another eagle was reportedly presented to President Washington and is said to be at his home, [[Mount Vernon]], although it is not certain the piece was from the first batch of eagles.<ref name = "breen"/>

In the 1790s, the production of coin dies was difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.  Mechanical reproduction of such dies was not yet possible; accordingly, coins of the same year struck from different dies can be distinguished from each other.  Dies still in use at the end of the year often saw continued use, sometimes with the date re-engraved.<ref>Albanese, pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref>  These different dies are reflected in significant varieties today:  some 1795 eagles have 13 leaves on the palm branch, others only nine.<ref name = "g135">Guth and Garrett, p. 135.</ref>

Minting of eagles was interrupted in late 1795 because of the death of the Assayer to the United States Mint, Albion Cox.  At that time, the Mint used unpowered [[screw press]]es to strike coins:  striking such large coins using muscle power was difficult, and few Turban Head eagles show the entire design strongly.  At the end of 1795, the Mint had 176&nbsp;eagles on hand; coinage resumed (with 1795-dated dies) in late March 1796, after most of the stock on hand had been paid out.<ref name = "breen"/>

As the half eagle approximated the size of a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] and the French [[louis d'or]], it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions.  DeSaussure is believed to have struck half eagles first for this reason in consultation with bank officals.  The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.<ref name = "breen"/>

The eagles originally had 15 stars on the obverse, representing the fifteen states as of 1795.  With the admission of [[Tennessee]] as a state in 1796, a sixteenth star was added to the obverse.  The first 1796 eagles were delivered by the Mint on June 2, the day after Tennessee's admission.<ref name = "choice"/>  Numismatic historian [[Walter Breen]] notes that as Tennessee's statehood had been uncertain due to opposition in Congress until shortly before the actual admission, the 16-star eagles most likely were not prepared until just before it became a state on June 1.<ref name = "breen">[[Walter Breen|Breen, Walter]].  "United States Eagles 1795<U+2013>1933".  ''Numismatic Scrapbook Magazine'', September 25, 1967, pp. 1723<U+2013>1729.</ref>  Other 1796 coins, with smaller denominations, are known to have been struck on polished blanks for presentation in connection with the statehood celebrations; it is likely eagles were struck in this way as well.<ref name = "b544"/>  With the possibility of additional states being added to the Union in years to come, Mint officials decided to have the obverse feature only 13 stars, representing the original states of the Union.<ref name = "choice">Hobson, pp. 113, 115.</ref>  All 1798 and later eagles have only 13 stars on the obverse, however some 1798 eagles have nine stars on the left and four on the right, while others have seven on the left and six on the right.  All 1798 eagles were prepared from dies originally dated 1797, and then re-engraved.<ref>Garrett and Guth, pp. 317<U+2013>318.</ref>  The Mint's coinage was decreased due to [[yellow fever]] epidemics in Philadelphia in 1796, 1797, 1801, and 1803; it struck few eagles then, giving priority to more popular coins.<ref name = "breen"/>

The public disliked Scot's reverse design, deeming the depicted eagle scrawny and unworthy of a great nation, such as the United States aspired to be.  The new Mint director, [[Elias Boudinot]], asked Scot to redesign the reverse.  The so-called Heraldic Eagle design was struck on [[quarter eagle]]s as early as 1796, but did not appear on the eagle until the following year, with the other gold denomination, the half eagle, following in 1798.<ref>Albanese, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref>  The initial design (dubbed by some the "Plain Eagle") had been struck in relatively small numbers:  only 13,344 Plain Eagle pieces were struck over the design's three-year life.<ref name = "g135"/>  Only 2,000 pieces were struck in 1798, but the following year, demand for the eagle surged, and over 37,000 were struck.<ref>Guth and Garrett, p. 136.</ref>

The precious metal composition of US coins was calculated so that gold would be fifteen times as valuable per ounce as silver.  By the turn of the nineteenth century, the price of gold in terms of silver had risen to approximately 15.75 to one.  This made it profitable for merchants to buy gold coins at face value using silver coins, and export the gold to Europe.  Gold vanished from circulation in the United States by 1800.<ref>Hobson, p. 115.</ref>  By 1801, almost no bullion was being deposited at the Mint, causing the [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson administration]] to consider its closure.  The eagle was especially desired by these exporters, as the larger size and value made it more convenient to handle.<ref>Lange, p. 41.</ref>  Although the MInt remained open, on December 31, 1804, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] ordered that eagles and [[Draped Bust dollar|silver dollars]] no longer be struck, ending the Turban Head eagle series.<ref name = "b546">Breen, p. 546.</ref>  Coinage of eagles did not resume until 1838 (after Congress revalued gold, eliminating the incentive to melt gold coins), when a new design, by [[Christian Gobrecht]] was struck.<ref name = "y260">Yeoman, p. 260.</ref><ref>Hobson, p. 116.</ref>

==1804 issues==

[[File:1804 eagle crosslet 4.jpg|thumb|right|1804 Crosslet 4 eagle.]] 
[[File:1804 eagle plain 4.jpg|thumb|right|1804 Plain 4 eagle, the only one on public display.]] 
Although the Mint coined 1803-dated eagles into 1804, a total of 3,757 eagles dated 1804 were struck in that year.  These pieces, dubbed the "Crosslet 4" variety, were heavily melted at the time, and the few known today are very collectible.<ref>Garrett and Guth, p. 320.</ref>  [[R.S. Yeoman]], in his latest "Red Book" valuing US coins, values the Crosslet 4 at $165,000 in [[Mint state|MS]]-63 ranging down to $19,000 in more circulated, Fine-12 condition.<ref>Yeoman, p. 260.</ref>

In 1834, the United States Government intended to present a set of then-current US coin to four Asian rulers the US had either made agreements with or else hoped to treat with.  Neither the silver dollar nor the eagle had been struck since 1804, however they were considered current coins.  Mint Director Moore decided to strike [[1804 silver dollar|1804-dated dollars]] and eagles for the sets, and four 1804 eagles were struck.  They differ from the pieces struck thirty years previously, lacking a crosslet on the right side of the crossbar of the 4.<ref>Albanese, pp. 134<U+2013>138.</ref>  Two were presented, to the [[Sultan of Muscat]] and the [[King of Siam]], before the diplomat, [[Edmund Roberts]], died of disease in [[Macao]], and his mission was abandoned.  The remaining two sets were returned to the United States.<ref>Albanese, pp. 144<U+2013>145.</ref>

The existence of the Plain 4 pieces was revealed in 1869, when one was reproduced in the ''American Journal of Numismatics''.  The significance and history of the pieces was not at first known, and the revelation prompted no particular excitement.  How the pieces returned to US authorities came to be dispersed is not known.  The set given to the King of Siam was sold at auction by descendants of [[Anna Leonowens]], who served as schoolteacher to the children of King [[Mongkut]] of Siam in the 1860s, though how it came into her possession is uncertain.  Today, three of the pieces are in private collections, the fourth is in the Money Museum of the [[American Numismatic Association]] in [[Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]]. The Siam set sold most recently for $8.5 million.  Albanese believes that the eagle in that set is not the original, but another of the four purchased to replace one sold to a collector.<ref>Albanese, pp. 150<U+2013>153.</ref>
