'''Tengah Air Base''' {{airport codes|TGA|WSAT}} is a [[military airbase]] of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] located at [[Tengah, Singapore|Tengah]], in the western part of [[Singapore]]. The airbase is the most important airfield of the RSAF as it houses the bulk of RSAF's fixed-wing frontline squadrons, home to all of RSAF's [[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne early warning and control (AEWC)]] assets, most of the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C/D Fighting Falcons]] and a large number of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]]. The air base goes by the motto of ''"Always Vigilant"'', which is supported by its main motif, a chess board [[Knight (chess)|Black Knight piece]] symbolic of the aircraft<U+2019>s operational readiness in Tengah. The sword represents war<U+2019>s heraldic sword of destruction, while the state is depicted by the castle.

Prior to [[Singapore]]'s independence, it was a [[Flight|flying]] [[Royal Air Force station]] known as '''RAF Tengah'''.

==History==
===RAF Tengah===
[[File:RAF Tengah Crest.jpg|thumb|left|RAF Tengah [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest Badge]]]]
'''RAF Tengah''' was commissioned in 1939. Tengah airfield was the target of [[carpet bombing]] when seventeen Japanese navy bombers conducted the [[first air raid on Singapore]], shortly after the [[Battle of Malaya]] began. It was also the first airfield to be captured when Japanese forces [[Battle of Sarimbun Beach|invaded Singapore]].

After the Japanese capture of Singapore, ''Tengah'' came under the control of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] while the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] took over the other two RAF stations of [[Sembawang Air Base|RAF Sembawang]] and [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]] as Singapore was split into  north-south sphere of control. This effectively ensured that the Japanese Army took control of the south, including the administrative hub and population center of Singapore City, while the Japanese Navy took command of the north, which included the [[Singapore Naval Base|Royal Navy dockyard]] at [[Sembawang]].

===Malayan Emergency===
During the [[Malayan Emergency]], ''Tengah'' was used to house [[Avro Lincoln]]s of the Royal Air Force and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] which performed bombing missions on [[Communist terrorism|communist terrorist]] bases/hideouts of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] deep in the jungles of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. In 1953 No 45 Squadron was equipped with DH Hornets and re-equipped with DH venoms in 1954 in Butterworth when No 45 Squadron was amalgamated with No 33 Squadron] T.11's of [[No. 60 Squadron RAF|60 Squadron]], joined by [[No. 14 Squadron RNZAF|14 Squadron]] of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]. In 1958 they were joined by [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 Squadron]] and [[No. 75 Squadron RNZAF]], both equipped with  [[English Electric Canberra]] B.2. The RAAF retained their Lincolns, with [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|1 Squadron]], until the end of the emergency.

===''Konfrontasi''===
[[File:Lightning.inflight.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|An English Electric Lightning F.6 similar to those operated by 74 Squadron from ''Tengah'']]

During the period of [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation]], the RAF deployed [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|74 Squadron]] with its [[English Electric Lightning]] F.6 followed by [[No. 20 Squadron RAF|20 Squadron]] with its [[Hawker Hunter]] fighter aircraft in addition to the [[Gloster Javelin]]s of 60 Squadron and [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|64 Squadron]], to the air base to help bolster the air defence of Singapore and Peninsula Malaysia against infrequent air incursions from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s and [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]s of the [[Indonesian Air Force]].

On 3 September 1964, an Indonesian Air Force [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] crashed into the [[Straits of Malacca]] while [[List of C-130 Hercules crashes#.C2.A0Indonesia|trying to evade interception]] by a Javelin FAW.9 of 60 Squadron.<ref>Conboy, p. 161.</ref> On 30 April 1968, the Gloster Javelins of 60 Squadron flew their last RAF operational sorties from ''Tengah'' and the squadron was disbanded the same day.<ref>Wixley, p. 422.</ref>

===V bomber detachment===
[[File:Avro Vulcan Malaysia.jpg|thumb|An Avro Vulcan B.1A bomber touching down, a detachment of these bombers were deployed to ''Tengah'' & ''Butterworth'' during the period of Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation]]

As a show of force to deter the Indonesian President Sukarno from launching an all-out war during this period, the RAF also deployed a [[V bomber]] force detachment to ''Tengah'' in the form of [[Handley Page Victor]] B.1A bombers from [[No. 15 Squadron RAF|15 Squadron]] in August 1963, which was rotated with those dispersed to [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Butterworth]] in Malaysia. The detachment of Victor bombers was replaced in October 1964 by a detachment of [[Avro Vulcan]] B.1A bombers from [[No. 12 Squadron RAF|12 Squadron]], these were subsequently pulled back to [[RAF Akrotiri]] in December that same year. In August 1965, [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|9 Squadron]] resumed RAF's Vulcan bomber detachment to ''Tengah'', followed by [[No. 35 Squadron RAF|35 Squadron]] in December 1965, these were in turn replaced by 9 Squadron again in February 1966. After June 1966, 9 Squadron returned to ''Akrotiri'' following the end of the confrontation.

According to British MoD documents declassified in 2000, up to 48 [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons]] were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at ''Tengah'', between 1962 and 1970, for possible use by the V bomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/12/31/stinwenws02015.html|title=Britain Kept Secret Nuclear Weapons In Singapore & Cyprus|last=Tom|first=Rhodes|date=31 December 2000|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=United Kingdom|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20010610212649/http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2000/12/31/stinwenws02015.html|archivedate=31 December 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avrovulcan.org.uk/1_group_presentation/darwindust.htm|title=Vulcans in camera: Vulcans in the far east|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref>

===British Pullout===
The RAF station [[East of Suez|closed at the end of March 1971]] and ''Tengah'' was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (later the Republic of Singapore Air Force) by 1973, after the British pullout. Despite this, the base continued to host British and Commonwealth air forces and troops under the auspices of the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] (FPDA) until 1976.

===Tengah Air Base===
It was renamed '''Tengah Air Base (TAB)''' in 1971, when it was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC). Currently, the air base houses aircraft such as the [[Northrop Grumman]] [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]]s and the [[Lockheed Martin]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon#F-16C/D|F-16C/D Fighting Falcon]]s.
