'''Matija Skurjeni''' (1898<U+2013>1990) was a [[Croatia]]n painter associated with the [[na<U+00EF>ve art]] movement.

== Background==
Skurjeni was born on September 14, 1898 in Veternica, Croatia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crnkovi<U+0107>|first=Vladimir|title=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti.|year=2000|publisher=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti.|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-6660-11-3|pages=144}}</ref>    His father worked as a carpenter and died in an accident felling a tree when Matija was a boy. As one of eight children, Skurjeni was forced to quit school at the age of seven to work as a shepherd in Veternica. He learned to read and write from his older siblings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malekovi<U+0107>|first=Vladimir|title=Skurjeni|year=198?|publisher=Sveu<U+010D>ili<U+0161>na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|isbn=1000019505|pages=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kelemen|first=Boris|title=Matija Skurjeni: Retrospektiva 1924-1975|year=1977|publisher=Galerija primitivne umjetnosti|location=Zagreb}}</ref>   At the age of twelve, Skurjeni found work building the [[Karlovac]] railways, but soon apprenticed a painter in [[Metlika]].  At the age of eighteen, Skurjeni served as a soldier in [[World War I]] on the Russian and Italian fronts.  After one year of service, he was wounded at Castel Tessino. He served once more as a soldier from 1921 until 1922 when he contracted [[malaria]]. After serving in the army, Skurjeni worked as a miner on his land near Golubovec, but preferred his more artistic occupations. He therefore finished his apprenticeship in Metlika and moved to [[Zagreb]], where he worked with the painters <U+201C>Broz-Gubec-Zako<U+0161>ek.<U+201D> In 1928, he was hired at the State Railways in Zagreb<U+2019>s workshop where he worked until retiring in 1956. In 1964, Skurjeni helped found the Association of Independent Na<U+00EF>ve Artists of Croatia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelemen|first=Boris|title=Matija Skurjeni: Retrospektiva 1924-1975|year=1977|publisher=Galerija primitivne umjetnosti|location=Zagreb}}</ref>

Skurjeni fell ill in 1975 and ceased painting. In 1984, he gifted a portion of his paintings and sketches to the municipality of Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107>, building the foundation of the Matija Skurjeni Gallery. He died in [[Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] on October 4, 1990.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crnkovi<U+0107>|first=Vladimir|title=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti.|year=2000|publisher=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti.|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-6660-11-3|pages=144}}</ref>

== Artistic Development  ==
In 1924, Skurjeni commenced copying [[oleograph]]s, making drawings on packing paper and coloring it with wall paint. These oleographs primarily contained religious images. At this time, Skurjeni was still considered a craftsman rather than a professional painter. 
In 1945, Skurjeni joined a Workers<U+2019> Cultural Society headed by Vinko Je<U+0111>ut that hosted evening courses funded by its instructors. The classes, which lasted until 1949, sought to instruct individuals about formal artistic techniques and initiate artists to the socialist realist movement. Skurjeni<U+2019>s paintings from this time period certainly reflect the movement, including figures with a more regular and proportionate anatomy, such as oval shaped heads. The Cultural-Educational Societies of Zagreb<U+2019>s art sections considered Skurjeni<U+2019>s art too primitive, however, and it was never exhibited in their shows in the 1950s.

The Belgrade Exhibition Pavilion opened the first exhibit of Yugoslav na<U+00EF>ve artists in 1957 in which Skurjeni<U+2019>s work <U+201C>Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107>ka rampa<U+201D> (Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107> Ramp) appeared, thus launching him into the realm of professional artists. Skurjeni began to receive international recognition as he exhibited with Vinko Je<U+0111>ut and other [[Yugoslav Railways]] employees. During the next several years Skurjeni forged a strong relationship with the Zagreb Gallery of Primitive Art and its director Dr. Mi<U+0107>a Ba<U+0161>i<U+010D>evi<U+0107> with whom he often collaborated.<ref>Kelemen. Matija Skurjeni: Retrospektiva 1924-1975</ref> 

From 1958, Skurjeni's style distinguished itself from other na<U+00EF>ve painters through his paradigmatic work.<ref>Crnkovi<U+0107>, Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti.</ref>  In the early 1960s, Skurjeni associated with the avant-garde artists of Zagreb who called themselves the Gorgon. He participated in their first exhibition entitled <U+201C>Salon G<U+201D> and then continued to use the Gorgon motif throughout his career, including pieces such as: <U+201C>Gorgon,<U+201D> <U+201C>In the Honor of the Gorgon,<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Gorgon Castle.<U+201D> However, while associated with several avant-garde artists, Skurjeni<U+2019>s style never conformed to the movement.<ref>Kelemen.

Skurjeni is considered one of the most influential independent na<U+00EF>ve artists, along with [[Ivan Rabuzin]] and [[Emerik Feje<U+0161>]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti|title=Postav|url=http://www.hmnu.org/vodic.asp|publisher=Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti}}</ref>   However, Skurjeni differs from many other na<U+00EF>ve artists in that his work often focuses on the beyond through symbolism, metaphor and the inclusion of many fantastical elements. He concentrates less on physical spaces than many other na<U+00EF>ve artists and hosts his paintings in a realm of imagination and dreams in a world he referred to as, <U+201C>beyond the real.<U+201D> His pictures often depict spatially and temporary separate actions converging in one tableau, especially in his studies.<ref>Vladimir Crnkovi<U+0107>, Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti. Zagreb: Hrvatski muzej naivne umjetnosti, 2000, p.145</ref>  Nevertheless, many motifs from Skurjeni<U+2019>s own life appear in his work, such as trains, mines, the gorgon, ruins, gypsies, astronauts and landscapes from Zagorje.<ref>Kelemen. Matija Skurjeni: Retrospektiva 1924-1975.</ref> He paints the working world but according to his own deformed characteristics.<ref>Malekovi<U+0107>,  p.7</ref>  Many of his motifs find links from his childhood and comment on political development.<ref>Kelemen.

The first written plans for the Matija Skurjeni Gallery appeared on July 2, 1984, when Skurjeni and his collaborator Milka Kobe<U+0161><U+0107>ak discussed donating several of his works to the municipality of [[Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107>]]. The Palace in Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107> opened the Matija Skurjeni Gallery July 15, 1987, proclaiming him an honorary citizen the same year. Up until 2000 the Gallery remained a part of the Brdovec Museum when, on November 20, the Minister of Culture announced the transition from the Matija Skurjeni Gallery to the Matija Skurjeni Museum after Kobe<U+0161><U+0107>ak bequeathed upon her death her own collection of Skurjeni<U+2019>s works to the city of Zapre<U+0161>i<U+0107> and the Skurjeni Gallery, leading the city to demand a more permanent exhibition space.

The Museum's permanent collector and guide is Vladimir Malekovi<U+0107> who also serves as director for the Museum of Art in Zagreb.<ref>Malekovi<U+0107>, Vladimir, Matija Skurjeni, Branko Bali<U+0107>, Ives Hervochon, and Nino Vrani<U+0107>.
