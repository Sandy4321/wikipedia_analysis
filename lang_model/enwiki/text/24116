The airfield included large hangars that fell into disrepair when the Soviets were ousted.

When the Americans and their local allies ousted the [[Taliban]], American forces took possession of the former Soviet base.  The Americans didn't need the volume of hangar space, so a detention facility was built inside large unused hangars.  Like the first facilities built at Guantanamo's [[Camp X-Ray]], the cells were built of wire mesh.  However, only captives held in [[solitary confinement]] have a cell of their own.<ref name=RadioFreeEurope20061005/>  The other captives share larger open cells with other captives.

According to some accounts, captives were provided with shared buckets to use as toilets, and did not have access to running water.

"I can't speak to what the conditions may be like now. But in my tenure, the prison population lived in an abandoned Soviet warehouse. The warehouse had a cement floor and it was a huge square-footage area.

"On the floor of that, what must have been some sort of an airplane hangar, six prison cages were erected, which were divided by [[concertina wire]] ... Those prison cages had a wooden floor, a platform built above the cement floor of the hangar. Each prisoner had a bunch of blankets, a small mat, and in the back of each one of those cages was a makeshift toilet, the same type of toilet that the soldiers used, which was a 50-gallon drum, halved with diesel fuel put in the bottom of it and a wooden kind of seat to that platform ... It's very similar, incidentally, to the conditions that the soldiers lived in; almost identical."}}

==Legal status of detainees==

The Bush Administration avoids using the label "[[prisoner of war]]" when discussing the detainees held at Bagram, preferring to immediately classify them as "[[unlawful enemy combatants]]."  This way, it is not necessary under the [[Geneva Conventions]] to have a [[competent tribunal]] determine their classification.  (In previous conflicts such as Vietnam, [[Army Regulation 190-8 Tribunal]]s determined the status of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].)

The administration also initially argued that these detainees could not access the US legal system.  However, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' confirmed that captives in US jurisdiction did indeed have the right to access US courts. ''Rasul v. Bush'' determined that the [[Executive Branch]] did not have the authority, under the [[United States Constitution]], to suspend the right for detainees to submit [[habeas corpus|writs of habeas corpus]].

Another consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Rasul v. Bush'' was the establishment of [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s to review and confirm the information that initially lead each captive to be classified as an enemy combatant.  The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) convened these tribunals for every captive in Guantanamo Bay, but they did not apply to Bagram. The current legal process governing the status of Bagram captives is the Enemy Combatant Review Board, described by [[Eliza Griswold]] in the ''[[The New Republic]]''<ref name=TheNewRepublic20070502>

{{quotation|Prisoners don't even have the limited access to lawyers available to prisoners in Guant<U+00E1>namo. Nor do they have the right to Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which Guant<U+00E1>namo detainees won in the 2004 Supreme Court ruling in ''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.'' Instead, if a combat commander chooses, he can convene an Enemy Combatant Review Board (ECRB), at which the detainee has no right to a personal advocate, no chance to speak in his own defense, and no opportunity to review the evidence against him. The detainee isn't even allowed to attend. And, thanks to such limited access to justice, many former detainees say they have no idea why they were either detained or released.}}

==Captives access to video link==

==Captives reported to have been held in Bagram==

According to Tim Golden of the ''New York Times'' the number of captives held in Bagram has doubled since 2004, while the number of captives held in Guantanamo has been halved.<ref name=NYTimes20080107>
