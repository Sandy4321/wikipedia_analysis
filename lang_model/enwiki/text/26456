'''''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]; meaning "City Square Sesame"), is one of the first [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|international co-productions]] of the American children's television program ''[[Sesame Street]]''.  Its first season premiered in Mexico in 1972, and was immediately a ratings hit.  It also aired throughout Latin America, to a potential audience of 25 million children in 34 countries.  Unlike some of the earliest co-productions, which consisted of dubbed versions of ''Sesame Street'' with local language voice-overs, ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' was a true co-production.  Half of the show was adapted from the American show, and half was original material, created in Mexico by Mexican writers, performers, and producers.  The first season consisted of 130 half-hour episodes.  The show's goals, similar to the process begun in the U.S., were developed by local experts in television, child development, and early education during curriculum seminars in Caracas, Venezuela.  ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo's'' goals emphasized problem solving and reasoning, and also included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child's environment.  Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions.  Early reading skills were taught through the [[whole language]] method.  The show's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.

The show's set consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region.  New [[Muppet]] and human characters were created.  In all, four seasons of ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' were filmed.  The first season resulted in some of the highest ratings in Mexico.  The fourth season, filmed in 1995, was broadcast in the U.S., making it the first foreign-language co-production shown in the U.S.  Studies conducted after the first season of ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' showed that it had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience.  Highly significant difference were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show.  Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show.  Characters from the show participated in campaigns promoting health and nutrition; in 2009, the Sesame Workshop, the organization responsible for the American show, was awarded the "Champion of Health" award by the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) for its efforts.

== Background ==
A few months after the 1969 debut of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS]] in the US, producers from several countries all around the world approached the [[Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|versions of ''Sesame Street'']] in their countries.<ref name="cole-148">Cole ''et al.'' p. 148</ref>  Co-creator [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the [[Muppets]] were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created".<ref name="world">{{cite AV media| people = Knowlton, Linda Goldstein and Linda Hawkins Costigan (producers) | year = 2006| title = The World According to Sesame Street| medium = documentary| publisher = Participant Productions }}</ref>  She hired former [[CBS]] executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in other countries.  By summer 1970, he had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call "co-productions".<ref>Davis, pp. 209<U+2014>210</ref>

Cooney was surprised that other countries were interested in producing their own versions of the American show.]]

As of 2006, there were 20 active co-productions.<ref name="world"/>  In 2001, CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street,<ref>Cole et al., p. 147</ref> and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.<ref>Gikow, p. 263</ref>  Doreen Carvajal of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that income from the co-productions accounted for US$96 million in 1994.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/12/business/media/12sesame.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print&|title = Sesame Street Goes Global: Let's All Count the Revenue|last = Carvajal|first = Doreen|date = 12 December 2005|work = The New York Times|accessdate = 29 June 2014}}</ref> Cole stated, "Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world".<ref>Cole ''et al''., pp. 169<U+2014>172</ref>  Most of the early international versions were what Cole called "fairly simple",<ref name="cole-148" /> consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]].  Studies conducted on the effects of several co-productions found that viewers of these shows gain basic skills from watching them.<ref>Gikow, pp. 252<U+2014>253</ref>

==Production==
''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' debuted in Mexico on the [[Televisa]] network in 1972.<ref name="abelardo">{{Cite web|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/meet-sesame-streets-global-cast-of-characters-148607164/#GrZdX6lqLegkt3CQ.99?no-ist|title = Meet Sesame Street's Global Cast of Characters: Abelardo - Mexico Plaza S<U+00E9>samo|date = 6 November 2009|accessdate = 31 July 2014|website = Smithsonian.com}}</ref><ref name="nashua" />  According to ''Sesame Street'' producer Gregory J. Gettas, ''Plazo S<U+00E9>samo'' was one of Sesame Street's first true co-productions, programs that were developed using a variant of a flexible model, called the CTW model, created by the producers and creators of the American show, in the countries they aired.<ref name="cole-148" /><ref>Gettas, p. 57</ref>  Like the American show in the late 1960s, the producers and researchers in Mexico conducted a curriculum seminar in [[Caracas, Venezuela]].  The goals they developed, however, were significantly different than the goals developed in the U.S.  For example, the ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' team emphasized problem solving and reasoning.<ref name="gettas-58" />  Their educational goals included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child's environment.<ref name="gettas-59">Gettas, p. 59</ref>  Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions.<ref name="gettas-58" />  The show was designed to address the educational needs of the region's 25 million children in 34 countries,<ref name="abelardo" /> including its target audience of 7 million children between the ages of 3 and 6 in Mexico alone.  Despite their common language, the show's Latin American viewers had a wide variety of customs and lifestyles.<ref name="nashua" /><ref name="gettas-59"/>  The show's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.<ref name="nashua" />

The American-produced and dubbed segments were analyzed for cultural appropriateness.  If any segments were considered "too American", meaning that they contained English writing on the screen, showed the American flag, or overtly referred to American history, they were removed.  The board was responsible for choosing content from the CTW's inventory, and it had to satisfy the curriculum goals chosen by the Latin American researchers.<ref name="gettas-58" />  They chose to teach reading through the [[whole language]] method, which emphasizes teaching children to recognize entire words or phrases, as opposed to [[phonetics]], the way the American show taught reading.<ref name="gettas-59" />  The Mexican producers and writers designed a distinctive set that appeared different than the American set and consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region.  The set included a background of mountains, a vacant lot with playground equipment, houses, a combination repair shop and store-cafe, and the plaza's central fountain and benches.<ref name="nashua" /><ref name="gettas-58" />  New music, written and performed by Latin American artists, was recorded, and writers and performers from Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela, were hired.<ref name="gettas-58" />

New Muppet characters were created and performed by puppeteers trained in Mexico City.<ref name="gettas-58">Gettas, p. 58</ref>  Abelardo, an "indigenous, soft-spoken orange-and-yellow crocodile",<ref name="nashua" /> was modeled after the American show's [[Big Bird]], and like Big Bird, was a full-body puppet that was controlled by the puppeteer from inside the costume.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/meet-sesame-streets-global-cast-of-characters-148607164/#GrZdX6lqLegkt3CQ.99?no-ist|title = Abelardo- Mexico Plaza S<U+00E9>samo|date = 6 November 2009|accessdate = 7 August 2014|website = Smithsonian.com}}</ref>  Paco, a grouchy green parrot, was based on [[Oscar the Grouch]].  Abelardo and Paco were both played by Justo Martinez.<ref name="nashua" />  The Muppets Beto and Enrique, who were based upon [[Bert and Ernie]] of the American show, were called  "national favorites" by the UPI less than three years after the show's premiere.  In 1975, Enrique and Beto were used to promote Mexico's nationwide free vaccination campaign.<ref name="nashua">{{Cite news|url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19750226&id=obRKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f5QMAAAAIBAJ&pg=956,464164|title = Television in Review: Sesame Street South of the Border|date = 26 February 1975|work = The Nashua Telegraph|accessdate = 8 August 2014|agency = UPI|publication-place = Nashua, New Hampshire|page=25}}</ref>

130 half-hour episodes of the show's first season were shot in [[Mexico City]] entirely in Spanish, under the control of a Mexican research and production team.  About half the show's material was adapted from the American show and dubbed into Spanish, while the other half was produced in Mexico and included animation, live-action films, and studio sequences with human actors and [[The Muppets |Muppets]].  A Mexican board of advisers, who set curriculum goals for the show, approved all content, both Mexican and American, something that followed the newly established policies of the CTW.  Mexican psychologist Rogelio Diaz-Guerrero was the first chair of the show's advisory board, which was later expanded to include child-development and educators from other Latin American countries, so that ''Plazo S<U+00E9>samo'' could be broadcast throughout Central and South America, including the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.<ref>Gettas, pp. 57<U+2014>58</ref>

The third season, which was filmed in 1983 and consisted of 130 half-hour episodes,<ref name="gettas-59" /> had different goals than the previous seasons.  One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, "a matter of critical importance in an area of the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high".<ref name="gettas-59" />  The third season of the show included characters created to "expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models".<ref name="gettas-59" />  The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities.  They cast performers in two different families.  The first family was more traditional and consisted of a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children.  The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home.  Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.<ref name="nashua" /><ref name="gettas-59" />  As of 1990, the third season was still airing in reruns.<ref name="gettas-59" />

In 1995, a fourth season of ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' was produced.  It featured a larger cast of children, more original music, and a new set designed by renowned Mexican architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]].  The season focused on a more innovative curriculum, developed by a board of Latin American educators and [[UNICEF]], and included topics such as health, hygiene, safety issues, cooperation, counting, and the alphabet.  The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, for the purpose of promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children's first teachers.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Univision and Children's Television Workshop Announce National Rollout of 'Plaza Sesamo'|date = 11 December 1995|publisher = PR Newswire|work=The Free Library|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/UNIVISION+AND+CHILDREN'S+TELEVISION+WORKSHOP+ANNOUNCE+NATIONAL...-a017842236|accessdate = 10 August 2014}}</ref>  The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; it was the first time an original co-production was shown in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Univision and Children's Television Workshop Announce the Introduction of 'Plaza Sesamo' in the United States|date = 28 March 1995|publisher = PR Newswire}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Now, Big Bird en Espanol|last = Freeman|first = Michael|date = 3 April 1995|journal = MediaWeek|issue = 14|volume = 5}}</ref>  As [[Gary Knell]], an executive at the CTW stated, "Our mission is to educate all kids.  And the fact is, in the U.S., especially in cities like Los Angeles, there's an enormous number of Spanish-speaking households".<ref name="greenbigbird">{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-27/entertainment/ca-51581_1_plaza-sesamo|title = A Green Big Bird? : 'Plaza Sesamo,' the Spanish-language version of 'Sesame Street,' is prospering in the U.S. amid debate over whether the program hurts or helps bilingualism|last = Cobo-Hanlon|first = Leila|date = 27 March 1996|work = The Los Angeles Times|accessdate = 10 August 2014}}</ref>  

The fourth season was test-marketed for American audiences in April on PBS and [[Univision]] stations in Miami, Dallas, and Los Angeles.  The test-run was successful, so PBS and Univision began airing it nationally in December; it reached 92% of the country's Mexican-speaking households.  At first, ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo's'' producers were concerned that the show would be attacked, but ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "even some staunch opponents of bilingual education concede that ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' has its merits".<ref name="greenbigbird" />  ''The L.A. Times'' also stated that its broadcast in the U.S. was an acknowledgment that Spanish was a prominent language in the U.S. and that more children were bilingual.  The show's supporters believed that exposure to an educational program like ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' would result in the transfer of Spanish skills to English and increase literacy in both languages.  Bilingual education opponents disagreed, but were not against the show's entertainment value.  According to Knell, the CTW found that watching the Spanish version did not draw children away from the English version.<ref name="greenbigbird" />

In 2012, ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' celebrated its 40th anniversary with the creation of a new website and a traveling photo exhibit.  In December 2013, the show's 15th season premiered with 52 episodes.  Segments were shot throughout Latin America; it was the first time the show was filmed in Colombia.  Its curriculum focused on math, literacy, diversity, and health.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Production to Begin on Plaza S<U+00E9>samo Season 15|date = 8 October 2013|publisher = Sesame Workshop|url = http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/production-to-begin-on-plaza-sesamo-season/|accessdate = 14 October 2014}}</ref>  A stakeholders meeting was convened in Bogot<U+00E1> in October 2012, consisting of interested parties from government and the private sector, and included officials from [[UNICEF]].<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Plaza S<U+00E9>samo kicks off 40th Anniversary with Stakeholders Meeting in Bogot<U+00E1>|date = 25 October 2012|publisher = Sesame Workshop|url = http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/production-to-begin-on-plaza-sesamo-season/|accessdate = 14 October 2014}}</ref>

== Influence ==
When ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo's'' first season premiered, it was the highest rated TV program ever broadcast in Mexico.<ref name="gettas-58" />  The UPI reported that all three seasons of the show had some of the highest ratings in Mexico; its second season, which premiered in 1975, "had piled on ratings that only Mexico's popular [[Telenovela|soap operas]] could rival".<ref name="nashua" />  Gettas claimed that ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' was "the model for all subsequent ''Sesame Street'' co-productions throughout the world".<ref name="gettas-58" />  He also stated that the first season "had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience".<ref name="gettas-58" />  In 1974, a study was conducted by American and Mexican researchers that studied the effect of ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo'' on its viewers.  Highly significant differences were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show.<ref>Diaz-Guerrero & Holtzman, p. 632</ref> &nbsp;Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show.<ref>Diaz-Guerrero & Holtzman, p. 643</ref>

In 1995, Parque Plaza S<U+00E9>samo, a 12-acre theme park based on the show, was opened in [[Monterrey, Mexico]], within the gates of the theme park Parque Fundidora.  It is the first theme park of its kind in Mexico.  According to a press release announcing its opening, Parque Plaza S<U+00E9>samo includes water rides, live entertainment, interactive, and educational elements.  It is privately owned, with Mexican investments, and featuredsthe show's characters licensed with the CTW.  Visitors to the park tended to come from Mexico and Southern Texas.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Flagship Theme Park Parque Plaza Sesame Opens in Monterrey, Mexico as First of Five 'Sesame Street' Parks Planned in Mexican Venture|date = 8 October 1995|publisher = PR Newswire|work = The Free Library|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FLAGSHIP+THEME+PARK+PARQUE+PLAZA+SESAMO+OPENS+IN+MONTERREY,+MEXICO+AS...-a017590805|accessdate = 10 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2003, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) and the Sesame Workshop collaborated in a program promoting vaccinations.  Their promotion reached over 147 million children and adults.  In 2007, the Workshop participated in an extensive health promotion in Mexico; they put many of the characters of ''Plaza S<U+00E9>samo ''on milk containers, which were given to schools, with positive messages about nutrition and exercise.  Studies showed that the promotion was effective.  Children choose healthy food associated with the show's characters, and 68 percent of families exposed to the promotion reported positive changes in their children's nutrition and hygiene habits.  In 2009, the Workshop was awarded the "Champion of Health" award by PAHO for its efforts.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Sesame Workshop's "Plaza S<U+00E9>samo" Receives "Champion of Health Award" From PAHO|date = 30 September 2009|publisher = Pan American Health Organization|location = Washington, D.C.|url = http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1851&Itemid=1|accessdate = 7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesameworkshop.org/what-we-do/our-initiatives/mexico/|title = Latin America: Plaza S<U+00E9>samo|accessdate = 7 August 2014|website = Sesame Workshop.org}}</ref> In response to [[2009 flu pandemic in Mexico|a flu pandemic in Mexico]], various national celebrities appeared in public service announcements with the ''Plaza'' Muppets, discussing flu prevention.<ref>{{cite news|title=Department of Health and Human Services; Three Federal Agencies Join with Sesame Workshop to Launch National PSA Campaign Stressing Healthy Habits to Prevent H1N1 Flu Infection|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Bioterrorism Week|publisher=NewsRX|date=14 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title="Plaza S<U+00E9>samo" educa sobre la gripe porcina|url=https://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/plaza-sesamo-educa-sobre-la-gripe-porcina|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=People en Espa<U+00F1>ol|publisher=Time Inc.|date=30 April 2009|language=Spanish}}</ref>
