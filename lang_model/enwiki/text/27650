"'''Baseball's Sad Lexicon'''", also known as "'''Tinker to Evers to Chance'''" after its refrain, is a 1910 [[baseball]] [[poetry|poem]] by [[Franklin Pierce Adams]]. The poem is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] fan watching the [[Chicago Cubs]] infield of [[shortstop]] [[Joe Tinker]], [[second baseman]] [[Johnny Evers]], and [[first baseman]] [[Frank Chance]] complete a [[double play]].

Tinker, Evers, and Chance began playing together with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the [[National League]] pennant four times between 1906 and 1910, often defeating the Giants en route to the [[World Series]].

The poem was first published in the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'' on July 12, 1910. Popular among [[sportswriter]]s, numerous additional verses were written. The poem gave Tinker, Evers, and Chance increased popularity. It has been credited with their elections to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946.

==Background==
[[Frank Chance]] joined the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1898 as a reserve catcher, backing up [[Tim Donahue]] and [[Johnny Kling]]. [[Frank Selee]], the Cubs' manager from 1902 to 1905, decided that Chance would be better suited as a [[first baseman]]. Chance at first opposed the move and even threatened to quit, but ultimately obliged.<ref name=sabr_chance>{{sabrbio1|21604876|Frank Chance|Gregory Ryhal|September 20, 2012}}</ref>

[[Joe Tinker]] was a [[third baseman]] in [[minor league baseball]], but in 1902 made the Cubs as a [[shortstop]], replacing [[Barry McCormick]].<ref name=sabr_tinker>{{sabrbio1|bc0df648|Joe Tinker|Lenny Jacobsen|2009-10-15}}</ref> [[Johnny Evers]] made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base.<ref name=sabr_evers>{{sabrbio1|efe76f7c|Johnny Evers|David Shiner|October 15, 2009}}</ref> Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to [[second base]] to back up [[Bobby Lowe]].<ref name=sabr_evers/>

Lowe suffered a knee injury late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time.<ref name=sabr_evers/> Tinker, Evers, and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902.

The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the [[National League]] pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs clinched the pennant after defeating the Giants in part due to [[Merkle's Boner]]. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off of [[Christy Mathewson]],<ref name=sabr_tinker/> and Evers alerted [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Hank O'Day]] to Merkle's baserunning gaffe.<ref name=sabr_evers/> In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a [[triple (baseball)|triple]] off of Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.<ref name=sabr_tinker/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E14FE3B5A17738DDDA00894D8415B888CF1D3 |title=The Cubs Win The Pennant - Hit Mathewson for Four Runs in Third Inning of Decisive Game and Beat the Giants.

From 1906 to 1910, the Cubs turned 491 double plays, the third-most in the NL during that time. According to [[Bill James]]' formula, "expected double plays", the Cubs led the NL with 50 more double plays than expected during those five seasons.<ref>Rob Neyer and Eddie Epstein (2000). ''Baseball Dynasties''. pp. 37-38.</ref> From 1906 through 1910, the "Tinker, to Evers, to Chance" double play happened 54 times in 770 [[games played]], and the trio did not collaborate on a double play during any of their 21 [[World Series]] games.<ref name=houk/> In 1906, the trio committed 194 [[error (baseball)|errors]], though this was in part due to poor field conditions and scorers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom |last=Verducci |url=http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1016975/index.htm |title=New York's foursome ranks with the best ever |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=September 6, 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

Adams wrote the poem for his column "Always in Good Humor" in the ''Evening Mail'';<ref name=mlb.com/> he signed it with his nickname, FPA. Adams, a native of Chicago and a former newspaper columnist there, penned the poem on his way to the [[Polo Grounds]] to see the Cubs<U+2013>Giants game. The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses.<ref name=tribune/>

On the poem's 100th anniversary, Tim Wiles, director of research at the Baseball Hall of Fame [http://baseballisms.com/baseballs-sad-lexicon.html revealed] a recent discovery. The poem was part of series of poems published in the ''New York Evening Mail'' and the ''Chicago Tribune''.  During the research process, combing the archives in the New York Public Library and the Center for Research Libraries, they have uncovered 29 poems, 15 of which detail a specific play or game that had occurred during the 1910 season, with "Baseball's Sad Lexicon" the first poem published.

==After publication==
In 1911, the Giants overcame the Cubs, capturing the first of three consecutive league championships.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10913F93A5517738DDDAC0894D8415B818DF1D3 |title=Giants Win Pennant - Matty In The Box - Shutout in Brooklyn Clinches First Honors in National League for New York|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1911 |accessdate=May 9, 2013}}</ref> The trio played their final game together on April 12, 1912.<ref name=mlb.com/> Hospitalized for a brain injury suffered while playing, club owner [[Charles Webb Murphy]] released Chance when they argued about Murphy's releasing other players with high salaries.<ref name=sabr_chance/> Murphy named Evers manager for the 1913 season, which displeased Tinker, who was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref name=sabr_tinker/> Murphy fired Evers after one season, and a number of baseball people made an effort to drive Murphy out of baseball. This involved the [[National League]] president [[John K. Tener]], and [[Charles P. Taft]]. The effort was successful, and  ''[[Sporting Life (US sports journal)|Sporting Life]]'' commemorated the affair with this variation on the poem:

<blockquote>
:Brought to the leash and smashed in the jaw,
:Evers to Tener to Taft.
:Hounded and hustled outside of the law,
:Evers to Tener to Taft.
:Torn from the Cubs and the glitter of gold,
:Stripped of the guerdons and glory untold,
:Kicked in the stomach and cut from the fold,

==Impact and legacy==
Chance died in 1924. Evers died in 1946, and Tinker the next year.

Despite their celebrated success at turning spectacular plays in collaboration, relations between the teammates were said to have been often strained.

==In popular culture==
[[Ogden Nash]]'s poem "[[Line-Up For Yesterday]]", written in 1949, references the poem:
<blockquote>
:'E' is for Evers

</blockquote>

The phrase and double-play combination helped inspire the song "O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg" in the 1949 musical film, ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out to the Ball Game]].''<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gxrmVhcJjAUC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22O%27Brien+to+Ryan+to+Goldberg%22+tinker+evers+chance+sinatra&source=bl&ots=MdoGaFPLwf&sig=eCchFf6ui58h7dkw5GIQKpiHXxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4g2MUaalGoLfiAL1z4CgCA&sqi=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22O%27Brien%20to%20Ryan%20to%20Goldberg%22%20tinker%20evers%20chance%20sinatra&f=false|title=Baseball in the classroom: essays on teaching the national pastime|editor=Edward J.

In [[Raymond Chandler]]'s ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]'', detective [[Philip Marlowe]] goes through his mail, opens it, and tosses it into the waste bin, remarking, "Mail slot to desk to wastebasket, Tinker to Evers to Chance."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The expression is still used on occasion today, to characterize any process that happens with smoothness and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as "like clockwork" or "a well-oiled machine." An advertisement for ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', a [[2003 in film|2003 film]], used the tagline in reference to [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Julianne Moore]].<ref name=tribune/>

The poem has been set to music and recorded by Chicago singer/songwriter guitarist [[Chris McCaughan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwm.accuraty.us/Magazine/ItemDisplay/tabid/807/itemId/1665/pageId/4/catpageid/1/Default.aspx |title=Still Stripped Down <U+2013> Chris McCaughan Returns with Side Project Sundowner |publisher=Iwm.accuraty.us |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>  The song, also titled "Baseball's Sad Lexicon," appears on the 2010 album ''We Chase The Waves'', by his solo project, [[Sundowner (band)|Sundowner]].
