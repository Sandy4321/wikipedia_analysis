'''New Jersey Route 413''' is a state highway in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It is an eastward extension of the longer [[Pennsylvania Route 413]] into New Jersey. The western terminus is in [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]] in the middle of the [[Burlington-Bristol Bridge]] crossing of the [[Delaware River]] at the New Jersey&ndash;Pennsylvania state border; the eastern terminus is at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 130 (New Jersey)|U.S. Route 130]]. Despite the east-west orientation, Route 413 runs north-south, but PA Route 413 is signed north-south. Prior to the [[1953 renumbering]], Route 413 was '''New Jersey State Highway Route S25''', a prefixed spur of [[New Jersey Route 25]].

== Route description ==
New Jersey Route 413 begins at the state line, midway along the Burlington&ndash;Bristol Bridge, as a continuation of Pennsylvania Traffic Route 413. The highway heads northward, heading along Reed Street, and there is an intersection with Delaware Avenue West, and soon after, intersections with West Pearl Street, and a local highway. Passing a few residences, Route 413 intersects with West Pearl Street, and enters a more commercial type of region. The next intersection with Brown Street is jammed with houses, and nearby is a large parking lot.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=40.072568&lon=-74.86416&zoom=18&q1=40.071386%2C-74.864503&q2=40.081484%2C-74.869503|title=Overview map of NJ 413|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Incorporated|year=2009|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>

At the intersection with Veterans Drive and Conover Street, Route 413 splits into a divided highway, and the highway intersects with with West Broad Street. After West Broad Street, Route 413 merges back in, passing several more commercial buildings and heading into John Fitzgerald Kennedy Park. The route parallels to the east of Washington Street, where it heads into a roundabout and terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 130 (Camden Avenue) in Burlington.<ref name="yahoo"/> 

== History ==
In the 1927 renumbering of highways in New Jersey, U.S. Route 130 was assigned as a part of New Jersey State Highway Route 25, which made up [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 1]] and [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] as well. During that renumbering in 1927, Route 413 was originally '''New Jersey State Highway Route S-25''', a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 25. The highway remained intact along its alignment in Keim Road to the Burlington&ndash;Bristol Bridge until January 1, 1953.<ref name="nj413">{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/11.html#413|title=413|last=Alpert|first=Steve|coauthors=Moraeski, Dan|date=2009|work=Moraeski, Dan|publisher=Alps' Roads|pages=1|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>

On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department performed a second renumbering of state  highways. State Highway Route 25, which had run at the southern terminus with Route 130, was decommissioned for the sole designation. Since State Highway Route 25 was decommissioned, State Highway Route S-25 would be orphaned and was decommissioned that day. The Highway Department renumbered S-25's alignment to NJ 413, which continued as [[Pennsylvania Route 413]].<ref name="nj413" />
