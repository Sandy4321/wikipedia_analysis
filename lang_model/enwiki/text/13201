'''Bayley-Ellard High School''' was a Roman Catholic secondary school in [[Madison, New Jersey]]. Established in 1880, it was one of the oldest parochial high schools in the area. The school closed in 2005 due to declining enrollment.

==History==
The '''School of Our Lady of the Assumption''' in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], founded by Rev. Bernard McQuid in 1850, was the forerunner of the Bayley-Ellard school. A parish grammar school, it was expanded and renamed the '''Bayley School''' in 1880 to honor Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]]. A two year business course was added to the grammar school curriculum around 1900.

Msgr. Edward Ellard introduced a four-year curriculum in 1920, making Bayley the first Catholic high school in the area.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mgr. E. J. Ellard, Morristown, Dead |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA061EF835541B728DDDAF0994D0405B878FF1D3 |work=New York Times |date=1937-08-16 |page=19 |quote=He was vice president and active head of All Souls Hospital, Morristown, and the founder of Bayley High School here. }}</ref> In 1943, Miss Margaret Hawes bequeathed $100,000 toward the purchase of a new school building to be named in honor of Msgr. Ellard. The forty acre Walker Estate in [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]] was purchased. The doors of '''Bayley-Ellard High School''' were opened in September of 1949, making Bayley the first diocesan Catholic high school in the  [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson|Paterson Diocese]]. The school was staffed by the [[Sisters of Charity]], [[Sisters of Christian Charity]], and [[Dominican Sisters]].

It was announced the school would be closing at the end of the 2004-05 school year in May 2005.<ref>{{cite news |author=Associated Press |title=Morris County Catholic school set to close |work=Press of Atlantic City |date=2005-05-22 |id=NewsBank ID 10A45AB5708B0748 }}</ref>

==Campus==
The school was sited on the former Walker Estate. Original buildings included a Colonial Revival mansion, conservatory and carriage house. Bishop's Hall, a classroom-gymnasium complex, was added in 1967, and a new sports complex consisting of football, soccer-lacrosse, baseball, and softball fields was completed later. The borough of Madison purchased the sports fields four years after the school's closing.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Schillaci |title=Madison is buying Bayley-Ellard fields |url=http://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2009/04/madison_is_buying_bayleyellard.html |work=The Star-Ledger |date=2009-04-30 }}</ref>
