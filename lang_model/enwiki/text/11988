'''Bristol Customshouse and Post Office''' is a historic two-story rectangular Italian palazzo style brick building that was used as a [[post office]] and [[customshouse]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], United States. The land for the site was acquired for $4,400 and the building was designed by [[Ammi B. Young]] and completed in 1858 for a cost of $22,135.75. The {{convert|46|ft|m}} by {{convert|32|ft|m}} building and is constructed of deep red brick and has three arched openings on each of its sides and stories that are lined with sandstone moldings. The archways protrude from the side of the building and the center archway serves as the first floor with the adjacent archways housing large windows that are barred with iron. As it typical of the style, the second floor is more elaborate with a shallow balcony of iron supported by iron brackets and the paneling of the upper facade's surmounting entablature is elaborately decorative. The sides and rear are similar to the front facade, but include blind recesses and the molding is of a browner sandstone. The building was abandoned in 1962 and acquired by the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) in 1964. The YMCA has an adjacent structure and used the building as an ante-space until 1990. Currently, the building is used as offices. The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is historically significant as it is an example of the Italian [[palazzo]] mode of architecture. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

The land for the site was acquired on April 19, 1856 for $4,400 and constructed in 1857 for a cost of $22,135.75.<ref name=book3 /> It was completed in 1858, from the design by [[Ammi B. Young]], the Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is a two-story rectangular Italian [[palazzo]] style brick building that rests upon a raised granite base.<ref name=nom /> The building is about {{convert|46|ft|m}} by {{convert|32|ft|m}} and is heated by steam.<ref name="book3">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mrJCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA643&lpg=PA643&dq=Bristol+Customs+House+and+Post+Office&source=bl&ots=7kGYajuSWE&sig=eaDuxHPymDbvaw17SoojVDWTzQw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1hN1U9CTJuvJsQTVtIDwCg&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Bristol%20Customs%20House%20and%20Post%20Office&f=false | title=A History of Public Buildings Under the Control of the Treasury Department: (Exclusive of Marine Hospitals and Quarantine Stations.) | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | year=1901 | pages=523}}</ref> The front facade is made of deep red brick that is has three large arched openings on both stories and a "greyish sandstone molding outlines the arches on both floors and caps the piers which separate the first-floor arches and a decisive molding of the same material forms a belt between the two stories."<ref name=nom /> The archways protrude from the side of the building and the center archway serves as the first floor with the adjacent archways housing large windows that are barred with iron. As it typical of the style, the second floor is more elaborate with a shallow balcony of iron supported by iron brackets and the paneling of the upper facade is "understated, but the surmounting entablature is heavy and elaborately decorated."<ref name=nom /> The cornice as the visual top of the building and conceals the low hipped roof that is only visible from a distance. The sides and rear are similar to the front facade, but include blind recesses and the molding is of a browner sandstone.<ref name=nom />

Alterations to the building are evident in an old photograph, dated to circa 1860-1869, which shows pedimented dormer in the center of the roof, that is believed to have been an addition that has since been removed. According to ''Bristol, Rhode Island: The Bristol renaissance'', a photo of the building dated to circa 1900 still shows the present of the pedimented dormers.<ref name="book2">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=45m3nFS5K3QC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Bristol+Customs+House+and+Post+Office+YMCA&source=bl&ots=4iqYV0hpwI&sig=pM0iJVJMOe4QeG3APJf8MjZcYu0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QQ91U4iKCdHesASN94CQCA&ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Bristol%20Customs%20House%20and%20Post%20Office%20YMCA&f=false | title=Bristol, Rhode Island: The Bristol renaissance | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Simpson, Richard | year=1998 | pages=21}}</ref> A postcard that was postmarked in 1920 also shows the dormers and the adjacent YMCA building.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.cardcow.com/401697/post-office-ymca-hope-street-bristol-rhode-island/ | title=Post Office & Y.M.C.A. Hope Street | publisher=Card Cow}}</ref> Also present in the photograph are two chimneys on the front facade and it is evidenced that the side chimney probably arose near the front, however, only one chimney is extant in the rear. This rear chimney was described as "apparently altered" without future explanation in the National Register of Historic Places nomination.<ref name=nom />

The 1971 nomination form noted that the then-current state of the building was in a state of neglect. The front area served as the postal sorting rooms, office and mail boxes with the original iron columns visible between the wood panels of the clerks' windows and the wooden [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]]. The tile floors were noted to be an alteration, but the second floor stair landing has what appeared to be original tiling. The second floor was accessible via cast iron stairs with iron railings, that lead up the customs quarters that had a large room with "seven sets of iron-framed windows, with heavy iron sills and interior
shutters."<ref name=nom /> This room was described as "impressively large" because of its {{convert|17|ft|m}} high ceilings and {{convert|8|ft|m}} paneled door, the floor is made of hard wood and a "very plain marble fireplace is in one corner of the large room."<ref name=nom /> The supports of the building stem from the cellar where granite piers support horizontal iron beams that hold up iron columns on the first floor.<ref name=nom />

== Service ==
The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office was used as a Post Office and Customs House, as its name implies, until it was abandoned in 1962.<ref name=nom /><ref name="use1">{{cite web | url=http://www.onlinebristol.com/walking-tours-of-bristol/historic-bristol-walking-tour.html | title=Historic Bristol Walking Tour | publisher=Online Bristol | accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref> Records show that $1,071.75 in repairs and $68.36 for "mechanical equipment" was spent by the United States government between July 1908 and June 1909.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IIwUAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA6-PA28&lpg=RA6-PA28&dq=Bristol+Customs+House+and+Post+Office&source=bl&ots=KEGamryvR2&sig=zhAPeU2Ge8bz23cLZhvC3UbVJO0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1hN1U9CTJuvJsQTVtIDwCg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Bristol%20Customs%20House%20and%20Post%20Office&f=false | title=United States Congressional Serial Set (61st Congress, 2d session, House Documents - Volume 133) | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | year=1910}}</ref> The [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) acquired the building in 1964, the building was attached to a YMCA swimming pool structure and was used as an ante-space until 1990.<ref name=nom /><ref name=use1 /> It was remodeled and currently is used as offices.<ref name=use1 />

== Importance ==
The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is historically significant as "an example of the rediscovery of the Italian palazzo mode of architecture after the long proliferation-of the Greek Revival."<ref name=nom /> Though Young designed dozens of building for the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], he was a master of the [[Greek Revival]] style and his designs varied throughout the years during the popularization of subsequent styles. Young also designed the [[United States Customshouse (Providence, Rhode Island)|United States Customshouse in Providence, Rhode Island]] a year prior, but its design reflected a more "classical, academic theme" in a more Tuscan style.<ref name=nom /> The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office "serves as an excellent example of a style that is little represented in a town which has fine buildings of other styles and periods, and is a reminder of what was once one of the most active seaports in the northeast".<ref name="nom">{{cite web | title=National Register of Historic Places nomination - Bristol Customshouse and Post Office | publisher=National Park Service | date=1971 | accessdate=15 May 2014 | author=Bene, Christopher}}</ref>
