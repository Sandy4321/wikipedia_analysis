'''B'Nai Jacob Synagogue''' is a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregation in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]]. Established in 1898, it was originally [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]. It constructed its current synagogue building in 1915, and joined the Conservative movement in the 1950s. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2004.

==History==
The first Jewish settlement in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]] in the 19th century was dominated by [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]] Jews, and in the early 1880s, there was an organized German congregation.  By 1884, this had dissolved as most of the original German pioneers died out and their children left town.  In 1886 there were about 20 Jewish families in town.<ref>Bertha Goldenberg, letter to [http://books.google.com/books?id=7Z4VAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA127 The Sabbath Visitor], Cincinnati, Vol. 16, No. 3? (June? 1886); page 127.</ref>  The Ottumwa Jewish cemetery, founded by the Ottumwa Hebrew Association in 1876, was the lasting legacy of this period of Ottumwa's history.<ref name=AJY5676>Henrietta Szold, ed., Ottumwa, [http://books.google.com/books?id=aMI8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA180 American Jewish Yearbook 5668], Jewish Publication Society, 1907; page 180.</ref>

[[Edna Ferber]] lived in Ottumwa as a child in the 1890s.  Her father operated The Fair, an Ottumwa [[department store]].  At the time, Ottumwa was a coal mining town, and the antisemitism of the town had a lasting influence on Ferber.  She wrote of her years in Ottumwa: "I don't think that there was a day when I wasn't called a sheeny."<ref>Eileen H. Watts,  Avery, Edna Ferber, Jewish American Writer:  Who Knew? in [Modern Jewish Writers in America], Evelyn Gross Avery, ed., 2007; pages 41<U+2013>42.</ref><ref>Michael W. Lemberger and Leigh Michaels, [http://books.google.com/books?id=33popDxxNp8C&pg=PA40 Ottumwa], Arcadia, 2007; page 40.</ref>

By the turn of the 20th century, Ottumwa had fewer than 50 Jewish families, immigrants from Germany and across eastern Europe.  Most were "in the junk and second-hand business", but there were also laborers, shoemakers, tailors and one prominent merchant.  Some families were extremely observant, "wearing two types of [[Tefillin|phylacteries]]", while others believed "in no Judaism at all."  One local Jew had a personal [[Torah]] scroll and a private [[mikvah]], but there was no organized community.<ref>Simon Glazer ,Ottumwa, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AI1uAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PA314 The Jews in Iowa], Koch Brothers, Des Moines, 1904; pages 314<U+2013>315.</ref>

In the early 1900s, many people called the area around the 300, 400 and 500 blocks of Main Street "Jew Town" because the stores in the neighborhood were mostly owned by Jewish families, many of who lived above their stores.<ref name="Courrier2005">B'Nai Jacob Synagogue in Ottumwa Turns 90, Ottumwa Courier, Sept. 13, 2005; weblink [http://state29.blogspot.com/2005/09/bnai-jacob-synogogue-in-ottumwa-turns.html] as of Dec. 6, 2010.</ref>  The B'Nai Jacob congregation was organized in 1898.  In 1907, the congregation was located at 404 E. Main St., and had 15 members out of an estimated Jewish population of 150.  The [[Hebrew school]] had 15 pupils and met once per week.  By 1919, the Jewish population of Ottumwa had risen to 412 and the congregation had moved one block into the current building.  The school still only had one teacher on staff, but there were 21 pupils and the school met daily.<ref name=AJY5676 /><ref>Harry Schneiderman, ed., Ottumwa, [http://books.google.com/books?id=32tIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA374 American Jewish Yearbook 5680] vol. 21., Jewish Publication Society, 1919; page 374.</ref>  The B'nai Jacob congregation numbered around 250 in the 1930s and 1940s. The synagogue affiliated with the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement in the 1950s.

== Building ==
[[File:B'NaiJacobOttumwaInteriorFromNorth.jpg|thumb|right|The sanctuary as seen from the North corner, with the [[Torah ark]] at the left, the reader's desk in the center, and the women's balcony at the upper right.  As originally built, the [[bimah]] was centered below the [[chandelier]].]]
B'Nai Jacob's [[Renaissance Revival|Renaissance]]<ref name=NRHPWapello/><ref name=Archiplanet/> or [[Art Deco|Deco]] [[Vernacular Architecture|Vernacular]]<ref name=Preisler/> synagogue building at 529 East Main Street (at Union Street) was constructed in 1915.  The architects were L.T. Chrisman and company and [[George M. Kerns]].<ref name=NRHPWapello/> The exterior is brick, with an addition in the back holding a kitchen and social hall, built some time in the 1950s.

As originally built, the [[bimah]] was in the center of the sanctuary, but in an earlier modernization of the building, the central bimah was removed.  The woodwork around the [[Torah ark]] is original, as is the 7-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] in front of the ark.  

The sanctuary features a woman's gallery against the south-west wall, built over the front entrance foyer and classroom, although it is rarely used. In traditional Judaism, women were seated separately from men, separated by a [[mechitza]] which frequently took the form of a balcony.  The separation of men and women at B'Nai Jacob ended when one woman's health problems prevented her from climbing the stairs to the balcony.

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 10, 2004 (reference number 4000815),<ref name=NRHPweekly/> and underwent major historic restoration in 2004<U+2013>2005.<ref name="Courrier2005" /><ref name=Buhrman2010/>
