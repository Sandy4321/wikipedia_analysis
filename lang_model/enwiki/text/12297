"'''Saddlesore Galactica'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] of the American animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on February 6, 2000. In the episode, the [[Simpson family]] rescues a [[diving horse]] named Duncan from the abuse of his owner and keeps him as a pet. When the cost of keeping Duncan rises, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] train him to be a [[racehorse]]. Duncan wins several races and, as a result, Homer is threatened with death by a group of [[jockey]]s. Meanwhile, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is upset over her school unfairly losing the musical band competition at a state fair and writes a letter to [[President Clinton]] in protest. 

The episode features several guest appearances; [[race caller|horse race caller]] [[Trevor Denman]] starred as himself, commentating the races in the episode, and voice artist [[Jim Cummings]] provided the animal sounds made by Duncan. [[Randy Bachman]] and [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] of rock band [[Bachman<U+2013>Turner Overdrive]] appeared as themselves in a performance at the state fair. "Saddlesore Galactica" was written by [[Tim Long]] and directed by [[Lance Kramer]]. A number of [[meta-references]] are included in the episode, such as the character [[Comic Book Guy]] telling the Simpsons that they have owned a horse before in the episode "[[Lisa's Pony]]".

Around 9.6 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD, along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. "Saddlesore Galactica" is despised by many television critics and fans according to Long. It has been cited by [[About.com]]'s Nancy Basile as one of the season's worst episodes, and by Marco Ursi of ''[[Maclean's]]'' as the worst episode of the series. Criticism has been directed at its outlandish plot, which, among other things, features elf-like jockeys who lure Homer into their secret lair where they threaten him to stop Duncan from winning.

==Plot==
[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and the other members of [[Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary]]'s school band enter a music competition together at a state fair, performing [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]]'s "[[Living in America (song)|Living in America]]". However, they lose to the Ogdenville Elementary band, which performs [[John Philip Sousa]]'s "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]" and uses red, white, and blue [[glowstick]]s to form a flag. Lisa accuses Ogdenville of cheating as the use of visual aids is against the rules of the competition. She later writes a letter to [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], complaining about the situation. At the fair, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] see a horse named Duncan that can dive into pools. The Simpsons take Duncan home after his sleazy owner is accused of [[animal cruelty]] and flees. However, they end up having financial issues because of Duncan; it costs them US$500 a week to keep him. 

Homer and Bart try to think of a way that Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him. Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and suggests that he should be a [[racehorse]]. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the [[jockey]]. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named "Furious D", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a nose ring. He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which turns out to be a secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be murderous elf-like creatures who want Homer to have Duncan lose the upcoming race. They threaten to eat Homer's brain if he does not comply. Though intimidated at first, Homer later vows to deal with those "murderous trolls". 

At the Springfield Derby, Duncan wins the race, and the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart. With the help of [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing to start a new life as a [[Stud (animal)|stud]]. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.

==Meta-references==
The episode is heavily self-referential and contains a number of [[meta-references]].<ref name="gray"/><ref name="classroom"/><ref name=Ursi/> When the Simpsons take Duncan home from the fair, [[Comic Book Guy]] points out to the Simpsons that they have already taken in a horse as a pet (as seen in "[[Lisa's Pony]]"), and that "the expense forced Homer to work at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], with hilarious consequences."<ref name="gray"/><ref name=Sepinwall>{{cite news|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=Mmmm... 300 episodes Homer's odyssey continues as 'The Simpsons,' America's favorite animated family, reaches a comic milestone|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2003-02-16|page=001}}</ref> In another scene later in the episode, when Lisa points out to Marge that Marge is showing signs of gambling problems, Comic Book Guy shows up again wearing a T-shirt that says "Worst Episode Ever" and tells Lisa: "Hey, I'm watching you!"

Jonathan Gray analyzed the self-referentiality in ''The Simpsons'' in his 2006 book ''Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality'', writing that "Sitcoms constantly 'reset' themselves, living in [...] an 'existential circle' in which nothing really changes, and every episode starts more or less where the last one started; and ''The Simpsons'' frequently plays with this sitcom clock, and with the amnesia of sitcom memory. The family members often forget important events in their 'history' [...]".<ref name="gray"/> Gray noted that in "Saddlesore Galactica", "the action continues as normal, as sitcom memory (or lack thereof) is pointed out but comically not acted upon. Thus, where David Grote [author of ''The End of Comedy: The Sit-Com and the Comedic Tradition''] (1983: 67) notes that sitcom episodes 'live in a kind of time-warp without any reference to the other episodes,' producing a situation whereby everything 'remains inviolate and undisturbed, no matter what transitory events may occur' (1983: 59), ''The Simpsons'' comically reflects upon this."<ref name="gray"/>

According to Long, "Saddlesore Galactica" is considered by many critics and fans as one of the worst episodes in the history of the show, particularly for the scenes featuring the jockey elves.<ref name="Long">Long, Tim.

"Saddlesore Galactica" has received some more positive reviews too, though. While reviewing the eleventh season of ''The Simpsons'', DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: "I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can<U+2019>t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment."<ref name=Jacobson/> [[DVD Talk]]'s Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as "fun".<ref name="dvdtalk"/>
