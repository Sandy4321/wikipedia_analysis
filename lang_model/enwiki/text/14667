'''Anthony "Tony" Adamle''' (May 15, 1924 <U+2013> October 7, 2000) was a professional [[American football]] [[linebacker]] and [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) and the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played his entire career for the [[Cleveland Browns]] before retiring to pursue a medical degree.

Adamle grew up in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and was a star fullback on his [[Collinwood High School (Cleveland)|Collinwood High School]] football team. He attended [[Ohio State University]] in 1942, but his college career was cut short by [[World War II]]. After a stint in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], Adamle returned to finish his education at Ohio State in 1946. He soon dropped out of school, however, and joined the Browns. Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning the [[1950 NFL Championship Game|1950 championship]] and advancing to the [[1951 NFL Championship Game|1951 championship]] but losing to the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Adamle left the Browns after the 1951 season to pursue a medical degree, but he came out of retirement briefly in 1954 as the Browns won another [[1954 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship]].

Adamle left football for good after the season, earning a medical degree from [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland in 1956. He settled with his family in [[Kent, Ohio]], where he ran a medical practice up until his death in 2000. He was a team physician for his local high school and for [[Kent State University]] for more than 35 years. Adamle's son [[Mike Adamle|Mike]] played in the NFL as a fullback in the 1970s before retiring and becoming a sports broadcaster.

==Professional career==

Adamle was eligible to play for the Buckeyes again in 1947, but decided to leave school and join the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).<ref name="Adamle drops out">{{cite news|last=Cobbledick|first=Gordon|title=Plain Dealing|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=April 3, 1947|page=18|quote=The management of the Cleveland Browns is emphatic in its statement that no effort was made to induce Tony Adamle, the bone buster from Collinwood, to drop out of Ohio State athletics in favor of a professional career. Nevertheless Adamle did drop out and signed a Browns contract ... Those factors, reading from left to right, were Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis. Those four, members of the Browns' championship professional team last fall, are back in Ohio State, enjoying the advantages of the higher learning <U+2013> and enjoying them in style.}}</ref> Adamle had been selected with the 105th pick in the [[1947 NFL Draft]] by the [[Chicago Bears]], and he told Cleveland head coach [[Paul Brown]], who coached Ohio State's varsity team between 1941 and 1943, that he would join the Bears if the Browns did not sign him.<ref name="PFR on Adamle" /><ref name="Adamle a surprise">{{cite news|last=Sauerbrei|first=Harold|title=Dewar And Adamle Are Browns' Big Surprises|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=August 6, 1947|page=18}}</ref> "I would be a pretty sick fellow today, knowing what I do about Tony, if [[George Halas]] had gotten him," Brown said before the season began.<ref name="Adamle a surprise" />

Adamle's decision to drop out was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and he was allowed to leave college.<ref name="Adamle drops out" /> The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out.<ref name="Adamle drops out" /> Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by [[Gene Fekete]], [[Dante Lavelli]], [[Lou Groza]] and [[Bill Willis]], four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.<ref name="Adamle drops out" />{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=70}}

With the Browns starting in [[1947 Cleveland Browns season|the team's 1947 season]], Adamle played as a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]. He competed with [[Marion Motley]] at the position, and said he was "not working to be a second-stringer".<ref name="Adamle wants to be first-stringer">{{cite news|last=Sauerbrei|first=Harold|title=Groza Misses, but He Is Using Wet Football|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=August 8, 1947|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|page=18}}</ref> Adamle was a straight-talker and was not afraid to stand up to Brown, a cold disciplinarian who was the team's coach between 1946 and 1962.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=70}}<ref name="Paul Brown PFR stats">{{cite web|title=Paul Brown Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/BrowPa0.htm|publisher=Pro Football Reference|accessdate=October 15, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KNjkXwuO|archivedate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Brown was impressed with Adamle's candor and held him in respect.{{sfn|Piascik|2007|p=70}} Before the seventh game of the 1947 season, a matchup against the [[Chicago Rockets]] that October, Adamle replaced Motley as the team's starting fullback.
