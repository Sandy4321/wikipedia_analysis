The '''Super Nintendo Entertainment System''' or '''Super NES''' (also called '''SNES'''{{hcref|a|Several common pronunciations exist}} and '''Super Nintendo''') is a [[16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by [[Nintendo]] in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Japan]] and [[South-East Asia]], the system is called the {{nihongo|'''Super Family Computer''', '''Super Famicom'''|<U+30B9><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30DF><U+30B3><U+30F3>|S<U+016B>p<U+0101> Famikon}}, or '''SFC''' for short. In [[South Korea]], it is known as the '''Super Comboy''' and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.  Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of [[regional lockout]] prevent direct compatibility.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).  The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities that compensated for its relatively slow [[CPU]], compared to other consoles at the time.  Additionally, the system's support for numerous enhancement chips (which shipped as part of certain game cartridges) helped to keep it competitive in the marketplace.

The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the [[16-bit era]] despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis]] console.<!-- See "Market share" for details -->  The SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era, and although Nintendo has dropped all support for the console, it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, and emulation enthusiasts, many of whom are still making "homebrew" ROM images.

== History ==
To compete with the popular NES/Famicom, [[NEC Corporation|NEC]] launched the [[Turbografx-16]]/PC-Engine in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]], and [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]] in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]].  Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES.  However, the NES would continue to dominate the gaming market for several years before Sega's system finally became successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |title=[[Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children]] |origyear=1993 |edition=First |publisher=Random House, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-679-40469-4 |accessdate=2007-07-03 |pages=pp. 353&ndash;356 |quote=The Genesis continued to flounder through its first couple of years on the market, although Sega showed Sisyphean resolve.&hellip; [By mid-1991] Sega had established itself as the market leader of the next generation.}}</ref>  Nintendo executives were initially reluctant to design a new system, but they reconsidered when the NES hardware began to show its age.  Seeing its dominance in the market slipping, Nintendo was compelled to create a new console to compete with its 16-bit rivals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

===Launch===
Designed by [[Masayuki Uemura]], the designer of the original Famicom, the Super Famicom was released in Japan on [[November 21]], [[1990]] for [[Japanese yen|<U+00A5>]]25,000 ([[United States dollar|US$]]210).  It was an instant success: Nintendo's initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out within hours, and the resulting social disturbance led the Japanese government to ask video game manufacturers to schedule future console releases on weekends.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

With the Super Famicom quickly outselling its chief rivals, Nintendo reasserted itself as the leader of the Japanese console market.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

In August of [[1991 in video gaming|1991]],{{cref|b}} Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, a redesigned version of the Super Famicom, in North America for US$199.  The SNES was released in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in April [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] for [[Pound sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]150, with a [[Germany|German]] release following a few weeks later. The [[PAL region]] versions of the console use the Japanese Super Famicom design, except for labeling and the length of the joypad leads.

The Super NES and Super Famicom launched with only a few games, but these games were well-received in the marketplace.  In Japan, only two games were initially available: ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[F-Zero]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |title=[[Game Over: How Nintendo Zapped an American Industry, Captured Your Dollars, and Enslaved Your Children]] |origyear=1993 |edition=First |publisher=Random House, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-679-40469-4 |accessdate=2007-07-03 |pages=p. 361}}</ref>  In North America, ''Super Mario World'' shipped with the console, and other initial titles included ''F-Zero'', ''[[Pilotwings]]'' (which demonstrated the console's "Mode 7" pseudo-3D rendering capability), ''[[SimCity]]'', and ''[[Gradius III]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3155264 |title=Out to Launch: Wii |author=Jeremy Parish |date=[[2006-11-14]] |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

===Console wars===
The rivalry between Nintendo and Sega resulted in the fiercest console war in video game history.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=Roseville, California |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |pages=p. 431 | quote=''Sonic'' was an immediate hit, and many consumers who had been loyally waiting for Super NES to arrive now decided to purchase Genesis.&hellip; The fiercest competition in the history of video games was about to begin.}}</ref> Sega positioned the Genesis as the "cool" console, with edgy advertisements occasionally [[Genesis does what Nintendon't|attacking the competition]] and more mature titles aimed at older gamers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

The Super NES eventually won the war and dominated the American 16-bit console market,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=Roseville, California |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |pages=p. 497}}</ref> and would even remain popular well into the 32-bit generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/printable/article/id,128295/printable.html |title=A Brief History of Game Consoles, as Seen in Old TV Ads |author=Danny Allen |publisher=PC World |date=[[2006-12-22]] |accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref>

===Changes in policy===
During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system &ndash; the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year, those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges.  However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1990, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=Roseville, California |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |pages=pp. 308, 372, 440&ndash;441}}</ref>

Nintendo also maintained a strict [[Nintendo policy#Censorship|censorship policy]] that, among other things, limited the amount of violence in the games on its systems.  One game, ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', would challenge this policy.  A surprise hit in arcades in 1992, ''Mortal Kombat'' features splashes of blood and [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|finishing moves]] that often depict one character dismembering the other. Because the Genesis version retained the gore while the SNES version did not, it outsold the SNES version three to one.<ref name="Kent_MK">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |publisher=Prima Publishing |location=Roseville, California |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |pages=pp. 461&ndash;480}}</ref><ref name="1UP_MK">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152604 |title=Purple Reign: 15 Years of the Super NES |author=Ray Barnholt |date=[[2006-08-04]] |publisher=1UP.com |pages=p. 4 |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref>

Game players were not the only ones to notice the violence in this game; Senators [[Herb Kohl]] and [[Joe Lieberman]] convened a Congressional hearing on [[December 9]], [[1993]] to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children.{{cref|c}} While Nintendo took the high ground with moderate success, the hearings led to the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Association|Interactive Digital Software Association]] and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]], and the inclusion of ratings on all video games.<ref name="Kent_MK"/><ref name="1UP_MK"/>  With these ratings in place, Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed. Consequently, the SNES port of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' was released uncensored, and this time Nintendo's version outsold Sega's.<ref name="Kent_MK"/><ref name="1UP_MK"/>

===The 32-bit era and beyond===
While other companies were moving on to [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit systems]], [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and Nintendo proved that the Super NES was still a strong contender in the market.  In November 1994, Rare released ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'', a platform game featuring 3D models and textures pre-rendered on [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] workstations.  With its detailed graphics, careful game design and high-quality music, ''Donkey Kong Country'' rivaled the quality of games that were being released on newer 32-bit CD-based consoles.  In the last 45 days of 1994, the game sold 6.1 million units, making it the fastest-selling video game in history to that date.  This game sent a clear message that early 32-bit systems had little to offer over the Super NES, and helped to clear the field for the more advanced consoles on the horizon.<ref name="Kent_DKC">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

In October [[1997 in video gaming|1997]], Nintendo released a redesigned ''SNES 2'' in North America for US$99, which included the pack-in game ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2467396.html |title=Super NES Lives! |author=Chris Johnston |publisher=GameSpot |date=[[1997-10-29]] |accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Like the earlier [[NES 2]], the new model was slimmer and lighter than its predecessor, but it lacked S-Video and RGB output, and it was among the last major SNES-related releases in the region.  A similarly redesigned ''Super Famicom Jr.'' was released in Japan at around the same time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2462190.html |title=Super Fami Gets Face-Lift |author=Yutaka Ohbuchi |publisher=GameSpot |date=[[1998-01-16]] |accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref>

Nintendo of America ceased production of the SNES in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=2&c=1249 |title=Super Nintendo Entertainment System 2 |work=OLD-COMPUTERS.COM Museum |accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref> about a year after releasing ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'' (its last first-party game for the system) on [[November 27]], [[1997]]. The last SNES title to be released in the U.S. was a version of ''[[Frogger]]'' in 1998. In Japan, Nintendo continued production of the Super Famicom until September [[2003 in video gaming|2003]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6029220.html |title=Nintendo to end Famicom and Super Famicom production |author=Hirohiko Niizumi |publisher=GameSpot |date=[[2003-05-30]] |accessdate=2007-07-15}}</ref> and new games were produced until the year 2000, ending with the release of ''Metal Slader Glory Director's Cut'' on [[December 1]], [[2000]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n02/shvc/index.html |title=<U+30B9><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30DF><U+30B3><U+30F3> (Super Family Computer) |accessdate=2007-05-19 |author=Nintendo Japan |authorlink=Nintendo |language=Japanese}}</ref>  Some consider the SNES to embody the "[[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] of video games", citing its many groundbreaking games and the perceived focus on gameplay over  graphics and technical gimmicks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?articles/gold_era.htm |title=The Golden Era |accessdate=2005-02-01 |author=Mattias Liedholm}}</ref> Others question this romanticism, believing the system was just another step in the evolution of video game technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoland.com/home2.htm?articles/gld_era2.htm |title=The Golden era - Just for the nostalgics? |accessdate=2005-09-09 |author=Silent Axis}}</ref>

In recent years, many SNES titles have been ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]], which has similar video capabilities. In [[2005 in video gaming|2005]], Nintendo announced that SNES titles would be made available for download via the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/615/615089p1.html |title=E3 2005: Nintendo's E3 2005 Press Conference |accessdate=2007-04-14 |date=[[2005-05-17]] |publisher=IGN}}</ref>

==Emulation==
Like the NES before it, the SNES has retained interest among its fans even following its decline in the marketplace. It has continued to thrive on the second-hand market and through console emulation. Many gamers discovered the SNES after its decline. The SNES has taken much [[History of the Nintendo Entertainment System#The twilight years .281995.E2.80.93present.29|the same revival path as the NES]].

[[Image:Zsnes-gui.png|thumb|ZSNES v1.51 user interface]]
[[Console emulator|Emulation]] projects began with the initial release of VSMC in 1994, and Super Pasofami became the first working SNES emulator in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zophar.net/articles/art_14-3.html |title=The History of Emulation |author=Sam Pettus |date=[[1999-10-24]] |accessdate=2007-07-18}}</ref> During that time, two competing emulation projects&mdash;Snes96 and Snes97&mdash;merged to form a new initiative entitled [[Snes9x]].<ref name="snes9x-readme">([[2007-05-01]]) Snes9x readme.txt v1.51.

Nintendo took the same stance against the distribution of SNES [[Read-only memory|ROM]] image files and emulation as it did with the NES, insisting that they represented flagrant [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp |title=Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.) |author=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Proponents of SNES emulation cite discontinued production of the SNES, the right of the owner of the respective game to make a personal backup, [[space shifting]] for private use, the desire to develop [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the system, the frailty of SNES [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s and consoles, and the lack of certain foreign imports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/EmuFAQ2000/EmuFAQ_Y2KAddendum2.htm |title=The Question of ROMs |work=EmuFAQ Addendum |author=Chuck Cochems |date=[[2000-03-11]] |accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> Despite Nintendo's attempts to stop the proliferation of such projects, emulators and ROM files continue to be available on the Internet.

The SNES was one of the first systems to attract the attention of amateur fan translators: ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' was the first major work of [[fan translation]], and was completed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web | author=Spinner 8 | title=Final Fantasy V | url=http://www.romhacking.net/trans/353/#translation | work=[http://www.romhacking.net Romhacking.net] | accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>

==Technical specifications==

The [[Central processing unit|CPU]] is a Nintendo-custom [[Ricoh 5A22|5A22]] processor, based around a [[16-bit]] CMD/GTE [[WDC 65816|65c816]] core. The CPU employs a variable bus speed depending on the memory region being accessed for each instruction cycle: the input clock is divided by 6, 8, or 12 to obtain the bus clock rate. Non-access cycles, most [[Memory-mapped I/O|register]] accesses, and some general accesses use the divisor of 6. WRAM accesses and other general accesses use the divisor of 8. Only the controller port serial-access registers use the divisor of 12.<ref name="anomie_memmap">{{cite web |url=http://www.romhacking.net/docs/memmap.txt |title=Anomie's SNES Memory Mapping Doc |accessdate=2007-04-21 |author=anomie |format=text }}</ref>

The chip has an 8-bit data bus, controlled by two address buses. The 24-bit "Bus&nbsp;A" is used for general accesses, while the 8-bit "Bus&nbsp;B" is used for support chip registers (mainly the video and audio processors).<ref name="anomie_memmap"/> Normally only one bus is used at a time, however the built in [[direct memory access|direct memory access (DMA)]] unit places a read signal on one bus and a write signal on the other to achieve block transfer speeds of up to 2.68&nbsp;[[MB]]/s&nbsp;([[Mebibyte|MiB]]/s).<ref name="anomie_regs">{{cite web |url=http://www.romhacking.net/docs/regs.txt |title=Anomie's Register Doc |accessdate=2007-04-21 |author=anomie |format=text }}</ref>

The DMA unit has 8 independant channels, each of which can be used in two modes. General DMA transfers up to 64&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]] in one shot, while [[Horizontal blanking interval|H-blank]] DMA (HDMA) transfers 1<U+2013>4 bytes at the end of each video [[scanline]]. HDMA is typically used to change video parameters to achieve effects such as perspective, split-screen, and non-rectangular windowing without tying up the main CPU.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

The 5A22 also contains an 8-bit parallel I/O port (which was mostly unused in the SNES); controller port interface circuits, including both [[Serial communications|serial]] and [[Parallel communications|parallel]] access to controller data; a 16-bit [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] unit; and circuitry for generating [[Non-Maskable interrupt|NMI]] [[interrupt]]s on [[Vertical blanking interval|V-blank]] and [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] interrupts on calculated screen positions.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

The picture processing unit (PPU) consists of two separate but closely tied IC packages, which may be considered as a single entity. It also contains 64&nbsp;[[KB]]&nbsp;([[Kibibyte|KiB]]) of [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] for storing video data (VRAM), 544 bytes of object attribute memory (OAM) for storing [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] data, and 512 bytes of color generator RAM (CGRAM) for storing [[Palette (computing)|palette]] data. The PPU is clocked by the same signal as the CPU, and generates a pixel every 2 or 4 cycles. Both NTSC and PAL systems use the same PPU chips, with one pin per chip selecting NTSC or PAL operation.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

Images may be output at 256 or 512 pixels horizontal resolution and 224, 239, 448, or 478 pixels vertically. Vertical resolutions of 224 or 239 are usually output in [[progressive scan]], while 448 and 478 resolutions are [[interlace]]d. Colors are chosen from the [[List of palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB color space]], for a total of 32,768 possible colors. Graphics consist of up to 128 sprites and up to 4 background layers, all made up of combinations of 8x8 pixel ''tiles''. Most graphics use palettes stored in CGRAM, with color 0 of any palette representing transparency.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

Sprites can be 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels, each using one of 8 16-color palettes and tiles from one of two blocks of 256 in VRAM. Sprites may be flipped horizontally and vertically as a whole. Up to 32 sprites and 34 8x8 sprite tiles may appear on any one line; exceeding these limits causes excess sprites or tiles to be dropped. Each sprite lies on one of 4 planes, however a lower-numbered sprite will always cover a higher-numbered sprite even if the latter is on a higher priority plane. This quirk is often used for complex clipping effects.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

Background layers in most modes range from 32x32 to 128x128 tiles, with each tile on one of two planes ("foreground" and "background") and using one of 8 palettes. Tiles are taken from a per-layer set of up to 1024 (as VRAM permits) and can be flipped horizontally and vertically. Each layer may be scrolled both horizontally and vertically. The number of background layers and the size of the palettes depends on the mode:<ref name="anomie_regs"/>
* '''Mode&nbsp;0''': 4&nbsp;layers, all using 4-color palettes.
* '''Mode&nbsp;1''': 3&nbsp;layers, two using 16-color palettes and one using 4-color palettes.
* '''Mode&nbsp;2''': 2&nbsp;layers, both using 16-color palettes. Each tile can be individually scrolled.
* '''Mode&nbsp;3''': 2&nbsp;layers, one using the full 256-color palette and one using 16-color palettes. The 256-color layer can also directly specify colors from an 11-bit (RGB443) colorspace.
* '''Mode&nbsp;4''': 2&nbsp;layers, one using the full 256-color palette and one using 4-color palettes. The 256-color layer can directly specify colors, and each tile can be individually scrolled.
* '''Mode&nbsp;5''': 2&nbsp;layers, one using 16-color palettes and one using 4-color palettes. Tile decoding is altered to facilitate use of the 512-width and interlaced resolutions.
* '''Mode&nbsp;6''': 1&nbsp;layer, using 16-color palettes. Tile decoding is as in Mode&nbsp;5, and each tile can be individually scrolled.
[[Image:Mode 7 Test-0000.png|thumb|right|A typical Mode&nbsp;7 screen]]
* '''[[Mode 7|Mode&nbsp;7]]''': 1&nbsp;layer of 128x128 tiles from a set of 256, which may be interpreted as a 256-color one-plane layer or a 128-color two-plane layer. The layer may be rotated and scaled using [[matrix transformations]]. HDMA is often used to change the matrix parameters for each scanline to generate perspective effects.

Background layers may be individually [[pixelization|pixelized]], and layers and sprites can be individually [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipped]] and combined by color addition or subtraction to generate more complex effects and greater color depths than can be specified directly.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

The PPU may be instructed to ''latch'' the current pixel position at any time during image output, both by game software and by the device attached to controller port&nbsp;2. The game software may then read back this latched position. The PPU may also be used for fast 16-bit by 8-bit signed multiplication.<ref name="anomie_regs"/>

The audio subsystem consists of an 8-bit [[Sony]] [[SPC700]], a 16-bit [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], 64&nbsp;[[KB]]&nbsp;([[Kibibyte|KiB]]) of [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] shared by the two chips, and a 64 byte [[Booting|boot ROM]]. The audio subsystem is almost completely independent from the rest of the system: it is clocked at a nominal 24.576&nbsp;MHz in both NTSC and PAL systems, and can only communicate with the CPU via 4 registers on Bus&nbsp;B.<ref name="anomie_apudsp">{{cite web |url=http://www.romhacking.net/docs/apudsp.txt |title=Anomie's S-DSP Doc |accessdate=2007-04-21 |author=anomie |format=text }}</ref><ref name="anomie_spc700">{{cite web |url=http://www.romhacking.net/docs/spc700.txt |title=Anomie's SPC700 Doc |accessdate=2007-04-21 |author=anomie |format=text }}</ref>

RAM is accessed at 3.072&nbsp;MHz, with accesses [[Time-division multiplexing|multiplexed]] between the SPC700 ({{fraction|1|3}}) and the DSP ({{fraction|2|3}}). This RAM is used to store the SPC700 program and [[Call stack|stack]], the audio sample data and [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] table, and the DSP's echo buffer.<ref name="anomie_apudsp"/>

The SPC700 runs programs (uploaded using the boot ROM program) to accept instructions and data from the CPU and to manipulate the DSP registers to generate the appropriate music and sound effects. The DSP generates a 16-bit waveform at 32&nbsp;[[Kilohertz|kHz]] by mixing input from 8 independent voices and an 8-tap [[Finite impulse response|FIR filter]] typically used for [[reverberation]]. Each voice can play its PCM sample at a [[Frequency modulation synthesis|variable rate]], with [[Gaussian interpolation]], [[Panning (audio)|stereo panning]], and [[ADSR envelope|ADSR]], linear, non-linear, or direct volume envelope adjustment. The voice and FIR filter outputs are mixed both for direct output and for future input into the FIR filter. All audio samples are [[ADPCM]] compressed using [[Bit Rate Reduction]].<ref name="anomie_apudsp"/>

Hardware on the cartridge, expansion port, or both can provide stereo audio data for mixing into the DSP's analog audio output before it leaves the console.<ref name="anomie_ports"/>

Since the audio subsystem is mostly self-contained, the state of the audio subsystem can be saved as an [[SPC700 sound format|.SPC]] file, and the subsystem can be emulated in a stand-alone manner to play back game music.

The console contains 128&nbsp;[[KB]]&nbsp;([[Kibibyte|KiB]]) of [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]].

=== Regional lockout ===
Nintendo employed several types of [[regional lockout]], including both physical and hardware incompatibilities.

[[Image:SNES Cartridge Comparison bottom.jpg|thumb|A cartridge shape comparison<small><br />''Top'': Japanese and PAL design<br />''Bottom'': North American design</small>]]
On a physical level, the game paks are shaped differently for different regions. North American cartridges have a rectangular bottom with inset grooves matching protruding tabs in the console, while other regions' cartridges are narrower with a smooth curve on the front and no grooves. The physical incompatibility can be overcome with use of various adapters, or through [[modding|modification]] of the console.<ref name="SNES-faq">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/snesfaq.txt |title=Super Nintendo/Famicom F.A.Q. |accessdate=2007-04-14 |author=Lou Cassaniti |date=[[1999-03-03]] |format=text}}</ref>

Internally, a regional lockout chip (CIC) within the console and in each cartridge prevents PAL region games from being played on Japanese or North American consoles and vice versa. The Japanese and North American machines have the same region chip. The console CIC releases the reset signal to the rest of the system only after completing a handshake with the chip in the cartridge.<ref name="SNES-faq"/> This can be overcome through the use of adapters, typically by inserting the imported cartridge in one slot and a cartridge with the correct region chip in a second slot. Alternatively, disconnecting one pin of the console's lockout chip will prevent it from locking the console; hardware in later games can detect this situation, so it later became common to install a switch to reconnect the lockout chip as needed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.com/markk/Consoles/SNES_Lockout.txt |title=Disabling the Super NES/Super Famicom "Lockout Chip" |accessdate=2007-04-14 |author=Mark Knibbs |date=[[1997-12-27]] |format=text}}</ref>

PAL consoles face another incompatibility when playing out-of-region cartridges: the [[NTSC|NTSC video standard]] specifies video at 60&nbsp;Hz while [[PAL]] operates at 50&nbsp;Hz, resulting in approximately 16.7% slower gameplay. Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in [[letterbox]]ing of the output image. Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and therefore can be played in NTSC systems without issue, while others will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60&nbsp;Hz mode supported by most PAL televisions. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes.<ref name="SNES-pal-switch">{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/markk/Consoles/SNES_50-60Hz_Switch.txt

All versions of the SNES are predominantly gray, although the exact shade may differ. The original North American version has a boxy design with purple sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever. The Japanese and European versions are more rounded, with darker gray accents and buttons. The North American SNES&nbsp;2 and the Japanese Super Famicom Jr. are both smaller with a rounded contour, however the SNES&nbsp;2 buttons are purple where the Super Famicom Jr. buttons are gray.

All versions incorporate a top-loading slot for game cartridges, although the shape of the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges. The card-edge connector has 62 pads, however many cartridges only connect to the middle 46. All versions also incorporate two 7-pin controller ports on the front of the unit, and a plug for a [[power supply]] and a Nintendo-proprietary "multi-out" A/V connector on the back.<ref name="anomie_ports">{{cite web |url=http://www.romhacking.net/docs/%5B195%5Dports.txt |title=Anomie's SNES Port Doc |accessdate=2007-07-13 |author=anomie |format=text }}</ref> The multi-out connector, later used on the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], can output [[RF connector|RF]], [[RGB]], [[S-Video]], and [[composite video]] signals.<ref name="SNES-faq"/> Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover on the bottom of the unit<ref name="anomie_ports"/> and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; newer versions use the RF capability of the multi-out connector.
{{-}}

===Game cartridge===
While the SNES can address 128&nbsp;[[Mb]]&nbsp;([[Mebibit|Mib]]), only 117.75&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]] are actually available for cartridge use. A fairly normal mapping could easily address up to 95&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]] of ROM data (48&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]] at FastROM speed) with 8&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]] of battery-backed RAM.<ref name="anomie_memmap"/> However, most available memory access controllers only support mappings of up to 32&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]]. The largest games released (''[[Star Ocean (video game)|Star Ocean]]'' and ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]'') contain 48&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]] of ROM data, while smallest games contain only 2&nbsp;[[Mebibit|Mb]].

Cartridges may also contain battery-backed SRAM to save the game state, extra working RAM, custom coprocessors, or any other hardware that will not exceed the maximum current rating of the console.

== Peripherals ==
[[Image:Snes control.jpg|thumb|252px|right|The European and Australian SNES controller]]
The SNES standard controller adds two additional buttons to the standard NES design, arranging the four in a diamond shape, and two shoulder buttons. It also features an ergonomic design later used for the NES 2. The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporate the system's logo in the colors of the four action buttons, while the North American version colors them lavender and purple to match the redesigned console. Many believe that several later consoles derive their controller design from the SNES, including the [[PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[PlayStation 3|PS3]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Wii_Remote#Classic_Controller|Wii (Classic Controller)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wii.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=6355 |title=Evolution of Controllers |author=Sud Koushik |publisher=Advanced Media Network |date=[[2006-01-30]] |accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2006/05/sonys_copycat_p.html |title=Sony's Copycat Policy |author=Chris Bateman |publisher=Only a Game |date=[[2006-05-11]] |accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3143627 |page=4 |title=Controller's History Dynamite |author=Chris Kohler |publisher=1UP.com |date=[[2005-09-13]] |accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gifford.co.uk/~coredump/gpad.htm |title=Evolution of the Game Pad |author=John Honniball |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shamoozal.com/nerdlog/2007/04/27/snes-controller-the-most-influential-game-pad-ever/ |title=SNES Controller: The Most Influential Game Pad Ever? |author=Phil |publisher=Shamoozal Nerdlog |date=[[2007-04-27]] |accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngeb.net/systSNES.shtml |title=SYSTEMS - SNES |work=NGEB |author=Alex Ricciardi, Sam Speer |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref><!-- Yes, that's a lot of sources. The claim that "several later consoles derive their controller design from the SNES" requires strong citation as it is a somewhat controversial statement. -->

Throughout the course of its life, a number of peripherals were released which added to the functionality of the SNES. Many of these devices were modeled after earlier add-ons for the NES: the [[Super Scope]] is a [[light gun]] similar to the [[NES Zapper]] (though the Super Scope features wireless capabilities) and the [[Super Advantage]] is an [[Video arcade|arcade]]-style [[joystick]] with adjustable turbo settings akin to the [[NES Advantage]]. Nintendo also released the [[SNES Mouse]] in conjunction with its ''[[Mario Paint]]'' title. [[Hudson Soft]], under license from Nintendo, released the [[Super Multitap]], a multiplayer adapter for use with its popular series of ''[[Bomberman]]'' games. Some of the more unusual controllers include the [[BatterUP]] baseball bat and [[TeeV Golf]] golf club.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/peripherals/index.html |title=Super NES/Famicom Peripherals |publisher=gamersgraveyard.com |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

While Nintendo never released an adapter for playing NES games on the SNES, the [[Super Game Boy]] adapter [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] allows games designed for Nintendo's portable [[Game Boy]] system to be played on the SNES. The Super Game Boy touted a number of feature enhancements over the Game Boy, including palette substitution, custom screen borders, and (for specially enhanced games) access to the SNES console.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/peripherals/supergameboy.html |title=Super GameBoy |publisher=gamersgraveyard.com |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

Like the NES before it, the SNES saw its fair share of unlicensed third-party peripherals, including a new version of the [[Game Genie]] [[cheat cartridge]] designed for use with SNES games and a variety of game copier devices. In general, Nintendo proved to be somewhat more tolerant of unlicensed SNES peripherals than they had been with NES peripherals.

Soon after the release of the SNES, various companies began marketing backup devices such as the [[Super Wildcard]], [[Super Pro Fighter Q]], and [[Bung Enterprises|Game Doctor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emucamp.com/red/SNES/index.shtml |title=SNES Backup Units |publisher=RED #9 |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> These devices were sold to create a backup of a cartridge, in the event that it would break. However, they could also be used to play copied [[ROM image]]s that could be downloaded from [[Bulletin board system|BBSes]] and the Internet, or to create copies of rented video games, often violating [[Copyright infringement of software|copyright]] laws in many jurisdictions.

[[Image:Satellaview with SuperFamicom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Satellaview]] with Super Famicom]]
Japan saw the release of the [[Satellaview]], a [[modem]] which attached to the Super Famicom's expansion port and connected to the [[St. GIGA]] [[satellite radio]] station. Users of the Satellaview could download gaming news and specially designed games, which were frequently either remakes of or sequels to older Famicom titles, released in installments. Satellaview signals were broadcast from [[April 23]], [[1995]] through [[June 30]], [[2000]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=258&page=2 |title=NintendOnline  |author=Glen Bayer |publisher=N-Sider.com |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> In the United States, the similar but relatively short-lived [[XBAND]] allowed users to connect to a network via a dial-up modem to compete against other players around the country.

During the SNES's life, Nintendo contracted with two different companies to develop a [[CD-ROM]]-based peripheral for the console to compete with [[Sega|Sega's]] CD-ROM based addon, [[Sega CD]]. Ultimately, negotiations with both [[Sony]] and [[Philips]] fell through, and the two companies went on to develop their own consoles based on their initial dealings with Nintendo (the [[PlayStation]] and the [[CD-i]] respectively), Philips also gaining the right to release a series of CD-i titles based on popular Nintendo franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279 |title=SNES-CD Profile |accessdate=2007-04-14 |author=Glen Bayer |publisher=N-Sider.com}}</ref>

== Enhancement chips ==
{{main|List of Super NES enhancement chips}}
[[Image:SNES Star Fox.png|thumb|right|''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]'', the first game to utilize the [[Super FX]] chip, as shown with the polygonal models that compose a large portion of the game's graphics]]
As part of the overall plan for the SNES, rather than include an expensive CPU that would still become obsolete in a few years, the hardware designers made it easy to interface special coprocessor chips to the console. This is most often characterized by 16 additional pins on the cartridge card edge.<ref name="anomie_ports"/>

The Super FX is a [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] CPU designed to perform functions that the main CPU could not feasibly do. The chip was primarily used to create 3D game worlds made with polygons, texture mapping and light source shading. The chip could also be used to enhance 2D games.<ref name="snes9x-readme">([[2007-05-01]]) Snes9x readme.txt v1.51. ''snes9x.com''. Retrieved on [[2007-07-03]].</ref>

The Nintendo fixed-point [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) chip allowed for fast vector-based calculations, bitmap conversions, both 2D and 3D coordinate transformations, and other functions.<ref name="overload-dsp">{{cite web |url=http://users.tpg.com.au/advlink/dsp/ |title= Digital Signal Processing |work=Overload's Puzzle Sheet |accessdate=2007-05-09 |author=Overload |date=[[2006-05-29]]}} Refer to the command summaries for all four DSP versions.</ref> Four revisions of the chip exist, each physically identical but with different [[microcode]]. The DSP-1 version, including the later 1A and 1B bug fix revisions, was most often used; the DSP-2, DSP-3, and DSP-4 were used in only one title each.<ref name="nsrt-chip-info">{{cite web |url=http://nsrt.edgeemu.com/INFO/chipinfo.htm |title=SNES Add-on Chip information |accessdate=2007-05-09 |author=Nach |coauthors=Moe, Lord Nightmare}}</ref>

Similar to the 5A22 CPU in the console, the SA-1 chip contains a 65c816 processor core clocked at 10&nbsp;MHz, a memory mapper, DMA, decompression and bitplane conversion circuitry, several programmable timers, and CIC region lockout functionality.<ref name="snes9x-readme"/>

In Japan, games could be downloaded for a fee from [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power kiosks]] onto special cartridges containing [[flash memory]] and a MegaChips MX15001TFC chip. The chip managed communication with the kiosks to download ROM images, and provided an initial menu to select which of the downloaded games would be played. Some titles were available both in cartridge and download form, while others were download only. The service was closed on [[February 8]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=16 |title=Nintendo Power |publisher=N-Sider.com |accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

Many cartridges contain other enhancement chips, most of which were created for use by a single company in a few titles;<ref name="nsrt-chip-info"/> the only limitations are the speed of the Super NES itself to transfer data from the chip and the current rating of the console.

==Market share==

{{cnote|a|The acronym ''SNES'' can be pronounced by English speakers as a single word (compare "NATO") in different ways, an initialism (compare "IBM"), or as a hybrid (compare "JPEG"); some even claim ''SNES'' should be pronounced "Super Nintendo" or "Super NES". In written English, the choice of [[A and an|indefinite article]] can be problematic due to these differences in pronunciation.<!--

Yes, these sources are forum posts. Yes, various policies consider forum posts unreliable as '''secondary''' sources. However, these are being used as '''primary''' sources through a logical extension of the WP:V#SELF policy (and WP:IAR, if you prefer). In short, besides being used in an article about the author, it makes perfect sense to allow the SPS to source a statement "Author says X" in any article. Here, this is repeated for many authors and condensed to refer to the authors as part of a relevant group. See [[WP:RS/N#"How do you pronounce SNES?"]] for further explanation and discussion.
