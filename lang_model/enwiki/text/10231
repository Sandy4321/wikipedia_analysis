The '''Apollo spacecraft''' was composed of five combined parts designed to accomplish the American [[Project Apollo|Apollo program]]'s goal of landing astronauts on the [[Moon]] by the end of the [[1960s]] and returning them safely to [[Earth]].  The spacecraft was made up of (from top to bottom) the '''[[Launch Escape System]]''', the '''[[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]]''', the '''[[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]]''', and the '''[[Lunar Module]]''' inside the '''Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter'''. These components were assembled atop launch vehicles including the [[Saturn I (rocket)|Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] (earth orbit checkout missions), and the [[Saturn V]] (primarily lunar landing missions).

The design was based on the [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] approach: two docked [[spacecraft]] were sent to the Moon and went into lunar orbit. While one separated and landed, the other remained in orbit. The two craft later rendezvoused and docked in lunar orbit, and one spacecraft returned the crew to Earth.

==Command Module (CM)==

[[Image:Command Module diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Apollo Command Module]]
The Command Module was the control center for the Apollo spacecraft and living quarters for the three crewmen. It contained the pressurized main crew cabin, crew couches, control and instrument panel, [[Apollo PGNCS|optical and electronic guidance systems]], communications systems, environmental control system, batteries, [[heat shield]], reaction control system, forward docking hatch, side hatch, five windows and the parachute recovery system. It was the only part of the Apollo/Saturn launch vehicle that returned to Earth intact.

==Service Module (SM)==
{{Main|Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|l1=Apollo Service Module}}
[[Image:Service Module diagram.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Apollo Service Module]]
The Service Module was a portion of the spacecraft that was unpressurized and contained fuel cells, batteries, a high gain antenna, radiators, water, hydrogen, oxygen, a reaction control system and propellant to enter and leave lunar orbit, and service propulsion systems. On Apollo 15, 16 and 17 it also carried a scientific instrument package, mapping camera and a small sub-satellite to study the moon.

A major portion of the service module was taken up by propellant and the main rocket engine. Capable of multiple restarts, this engine placed the Apollo spacecraft into and out of lunar orbit, and was used for mid-course corrections between the earth and the moon.

The Service Module remained attached to the Command Module throughout the mission. It was jettisoned just prior to reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.

==Lunar Module (LM)==

[[Image:Lunar Module diagram.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Apollo Lunar Module]]

The Lunar Module was the portion of the Apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon and returned to lunar orbit and was the first true "spaceship" since it was designed to fly solely in the vacuum of space. It was divided into two major parts, the Descent Module and the Ascent Module. It supplied life support systems for two astronauts for a total of four to five days. The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by the [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Company]] led by Tom Kelly.

The Descent Stage contained the landing gear, landing radar antenna, descent rocket engine, and fuel to land on the moon. It also had several cargo compartments used to carry among other things, the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages [[ALSEP]], the Modularized Equipment Transporter (MET) (a hand-pulled equipment cart used on [[Apollo 14]]), the [[Lunar Rover]] (moon car - [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16|16]] and [[Apollo 17|17]]), surface television camera, surface tools and lunar sample collection boxes.

The Ascent Stage contained the crew cabin, instrument panels, overhead hatch/docking port, forward hatch, [[Apollo PGNCS|optical and electronic guidance systems]], reaction control system, radar and communications antennas, ascent rocket engine and fuel to return to lunar orbit and [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with the Apollo Command and Service Modules.

==Launch Escape System (LES)==

[[Image:Apollo Pad Abort Test -2.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Pad Abort Test, showing pitch motor and launch escape motor in operation]]
{{See also|Apollo abort modes}}
The purpose of the Apollo [[launch escape system]] was to pull the Command Module (which contained the crew cabin) away from the launch vehicle in an abort.  The emergency could be a pad fire, exploding launch vehicle or a launch vehicle going off course.

The Launch Escape System would work automatically (or through manual activation) to fire a solid fuel escape rocket and open a canard system to direct the Command Module away from, and off the path of, a launch vehicle in trouble. The Launch Escape System would then jettison and the Command Module would land with its [[parachute]] recovery system.

If the emergency happened on the launch pad, the Launch Escape System would lift the Command Module to a sufficient height to allow the recovery parachutes to deploy safely before coming in contact with the ground.

===Major components of the Launch Escape System===
*'''Nose Cone and Q-Ball'''<U+2014>The nosecone of the LES contained sensors to sense [[Dynamic pressure|aerodynamic pressure]] ("Q"), and thereby determine the angle of attack, airspeed, and attitude of the spacecraft and launch vehicle. This structure, known as the Q-ball,<ref>http://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/01_Day1_Pt1.htm</ref> relayed this information to the command module and the launch vehicle guidance system.
*'''Q-Ball cover'''<U+2014>The Q-ball's [[pitot tube]]s, which could easily be clogged by debris, were protected by a styrofoam cover that was removed a few seconds before launch.<ref>http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ap15fj/video/ap15_liftoff.mpg</ref>  The Q-ball cover was split in half vertically and held together by a {{convert|2|in|mm|sing=on}} rubber band. A razor blade was positioned behind the rubber band, pinched between the halves of the cover. A wire rope was connected to the top and bottom of the razor blade and to both halves of the cover. The wire rope was routed through a pulley on the hammerhead crane at the top of the launch umbilical tower (LUT) down to a tube on the right side of the {{convert|360|ft|m|sing=on}} level of the LUT. The wire rope was connected to a cylindrical weight inside a tube. The weight rested on a lever controlled by a pneumatic solenoid valve. When the valve was actuated from the Launch Control Center (LCC), the pneumatic pressure of 600 PSI GN2 (nitrogen gas) rotated the lever down allowing the weight to drop down the tube. The dropping weight pulled the wire rope, which pulled the blade cutting the rubber band, and the wire rope pulled the halves of the cover away from the launch vehicle. The apparent overengineering of this simple system was due to the fact that the launch escape system, which depended on the Q-ball data, was armed 5 minutes before launch, so retraction of the Q-ball cover was a life-critical part of a possible pad abort.
*'''Canard Assembly and Pitch Motor'''<U+2014>These worked in combination to direct the Command Module off a straight path and to the side during an emergency. This would direct the Command Module off the flight path of an exploding launch vehicle. It would also direct the Command Module to land off to the side of any launch pad fire and not in the middle of it.
*'''Tower Jettison Motor'''<U+2014>A smaller solid fuel motor that jettisons the Launch Escape System after it is no longer needed. This usually happens after second stage ignition. 
*'''Launch Escape Motor'''<U+2014>The main [[solid fuel rocket motor]] that, firing through four rocket nozzles, pulls the Command Module rapidly away from a launch emergency.
*'''Launch Escape Tower'''<U+2014>Assembly that attaches the Launch Escape System rocket motors to the Command Module.
*'''Boost Protective Cover'''<U+2014>Hollow conical structure that fit over the Command Module during launch. It protected the Command Module heat shield and windows during ascent through the atmosphere. It also protected the Command Module from rocket exhaust should the Launch Escape System have to be used.

==Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)==

[[Image:ApolloSpacecraftLMAdapterDiagram.png|thumb|250px|left|Apollo Spacecraft-to-LM Adapter]]

The Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) was a conical aluminum structure which supported the Service Module above the Saturn [[S-IVB]] rocket stage. It protected the [[Lunar Module]] (LM), the '''Service Propulsion System''' engine nozzle, and the launch vehicle to Service Module umbilical during launch and ascent through the atmosphere. 

The SLA was composed of four fixed {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} panels bolted to the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] on top of the [[S-IVB]] stage, which were connected via hinges to four {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} panels which would open from the top similar to flower petals.

The SLA was made from {{convert|1.7|in|mm|abbr=off}} thick aluminum honeycomb material.<ref>http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730010176_1973010176.pdf</ref> The exterior of the SLA was covered by a thin ({{convert|0.03|<U+2013>|0.2|in|mm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) layer of cork and painted white to minimize thermal stresses during launch and ascent.<ref>http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-3.html</ref>

The Service Module was bolted to a flange at the top of the longer panels, and power to the SLA multiply-redundant pyrotechnics was provided by an umbilical. Because a failure to separate from the [[S-IVB]] stage could leave the crew stranded in orbit, the separation system used multiple signal paths, multiple detonators and multiple explosive charges where the detonation of one charge would set off another even if the detonator on that charge failed to function.

Once in space, the astronauts pressed the 'CSM/LV Sep' button on the control panel to separate the Command and Service Module (CSM) from the launch vehicle. [[Detonating cord]] was ignited around the flange between the Service Module and SLA, and along the joints between the four SLA panels, releasing the Service Module and blowing apart the connections between the panels. Dual-redundant pyrotechnic thrusters at the lower end of the SLA panels then fired to rotate them around the hinges at 30-60 degrees per second.

[[Image:ApolloSpacecraftLMAdapterSeperation.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Artist's conception of SLA panel separation in space on the Apollo 8 mission.]]

On the Apollo 7 flight the SLA panels were retained on the [[S-IVB]], but concerns about collision between the CSM and the SLA panels when docking with the [[Lunar Module]] led to a decision that the Saturn V launches would release the panels during the separation process. When they opened to an angle of approximately 45 degrees the hinges connecting the moving panels to the fixed panels disengaged, and springs pushed the panels away from the [[S-IVB]] at a velocity of around five miles per hour. Hence by the time the astronauts had rotated the Command/Service Module through one hundred and eighty degrees in preparation for [[space rendezvous|docking]], the panels were a safe distance away with no chance of a collision occurring.

The [[Lunar Module]] was connected to the SLA at four points around the lower panels. After the astronauts docked the CSM to the LM, they blew charges to separate those connections and a guillotine severed the LM to [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] umbilical. After the charges fired, springs pushed the LM away from the [[S-IVB]] and the astronauts were free to continue their trip to the Moon.

Note 1: The Service Modules for all Apollo spacecraft were jettisoned before earth re-entry, so all have burned up in the Earth's atmosphere.<br />
Note 2: Lunar orbits are generally unstable, so spacecraft jettisoned in lunar orbit would eventually strike the Moon. However, the impact sites would be unknown.
