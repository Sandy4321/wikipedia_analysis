The '''''Spetsai''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''<U+0398>/<U+039A> <U+03A3><U+03C0><U+03AD><U+03C4><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>''''') was a Greek [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] battleship of the {{sclass-|Hydra|ironclad|4}} that served in the [[Royal Hellenic Navy]] from 1890 until 1920. She was named after the [[Saronic Gulf]] island of [[Spetses]], which played a key role in the war at sea during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. ''Spetsai'' she was ordered in 1885 in response to a crisis in the Balkans and Ottoman naval expansion. The ship was launched in 1889 and delivered to Greece by 1902. She was armed with a main battery of three {{convert|10.8|in|abbr=off}} guns and five {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=off}} guns, and had a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|abbr=off}}.

''Spetsai'' and her sisters saw extensive service with the Greek Navy. They participated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco&ndash;Turkish War]] in 1897 until the [[Concert of Europe|Great Powers]] intervened and prevented the Greek Navy from capitalizing on their superiority over the [[Ottoman Navy]]. ''Psara'' saw action in the [[First Balkan War]] at the [[Naval Battle of Elli]] and was present at the [[Naval Battle of Lemnos]], but was too slow to actively engage the Ottoman forces. She did not see action during [[World War I]], and  was used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was sold for scrapping.

{{main|Hydra class battleship}}
In 1885, Greece ordered three new ironclads of the {{sclass|Hydra|battleship|4}}.<ref name=GG382>Gardiner & Gray, p. 382</ref> ''Spetsai'' was ordered from the ''[[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e]]'' shipyard in [[Le Havre]], France during the premiership of [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]. The ship, named for the island of [[Spetses|Spetsai]], was launched on 26 October 1889, and by 1892, she and her sister-ships [[Greek battleship Hydra|''Hydra'']] and [[Greek battleship Psara|''Psara'']] were delivered to the Greek fleet.<ref>Brassey, p. 25</ref><ref name=G387>Gardiner, p. 387</ref><ref>''The Chinese Times'', p. 488</ref><ref>Neal, p. 603</ref> The ship was {{convert|334|ft|8|in}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|51|ft|10|in|abbr=on}} and a mean [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|18|ft|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|4808|MT|sp=us}} as built. She was powered by a pair of steam engines of unknown type; they were rated at {{convert|6700|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|17|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|500|MT|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G387/>

''Spetsai''{{'}}s main battery consisted of three {{convert|10.8|in|abbr=on}} guns. Two guns were mounted forward in [[barbette]]s on either side of the forward [[superstructure]]; these were L/34 guns. The third gun, a L/28 gun, was placed in a [[gun turret|turret]] aft. The secondary battery consisted of four {{convert|5.9|in|abbr=on}} L/36 guns in [[casemate]]s were mounted below the forward main battery, and a fifth 5.9-inch gun was placed on the [[centerline (ship marking)|centerline]] on the same deck as the main battery. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included four {{convert|3.4|in|abbr=on}} L/22 guns, four 3-pounder guns, four 1-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder revolver cannons. The ship was also armed with three {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship was armored with a mix of [[Schneider Electric|Creusot]] and [[Compound armour|compound steel]]. The [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|12|in|abbr=on}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} of armor.<ref name=G387/>

==Service history==
''Spetsai'' saw limited action in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco&ndash;Turkish War]] in 1897, as the Royal Hellenic Navy was unable to make use of its superiority over the Ottoman Navy. The [[Ottoman Navy]] had remained in port during the conflict, but a major naval intervention of the [[Concert of Europe|Great Powers]] prevented the Greeks from capitalizing on their superiority.<ref name=GG382/> The conflict was centered on the island of [[Crete]], which was the object of an international naval demonstration in 1897&ndash;1898; the Great Powers mediated a solution to the conflict that saw Crete returned to Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 220</ref> In 1897&ndash;1900, ''Spetsai'' and her sister-ships were partially rearmed; ''Spetsai'' was modified at the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e|La Seyne shipyard]]. Their small-caliber guns were replaced with one {{convert|3.9|in|abbr=on}} gun forward, eight 9-pounder guns, four 3-pounders, and ten 1-pounder revolver cannons. One of the 14-inch torpedo tubes was replaced with a {{convert|15|in|abbr=on}} weapon.<ref name=G387/><ref>Mason, p. 293</ref> In 1908&ndash;1910, the old 5.9&nbsp;in guns were replaced with new, longer L/45 models.<ref name=GG383>Gardiner & Gray, p. 383</ref>

The [[Balkan League]], of which Greece was a member, declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]] in October 1912.<ref>Hall, p. 24</ref> Two months later, the Ottoman fleet attacked the Greek navy, in an attempt to disrupt the naval blockade surrounding the [[Dardanelles]].<ref name=Hall/> The Ottoman fleet, which included the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s [[SMS Kurf<U+00FC>rst Friedrich Wilhelm|''Turgut Reis'']], [[SMS Weissenburg|''Barbaros Hayreddin'']], the outdated ironclad battleships [[Ottoman ironclad Mesudiye|''Mesudiye'']] and [[Ottoman ironclad Assar-i Tewfik|''Assar-i Tewfik'']], nine destroyers, and six torpedo boats, sortied from the Dardanelles in the morning, at 09:30. The smaller ships remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north, remaining near to the coast. The Greek flotilla, which included the [[armored cruiser]] [[Greek armored cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']] and ''Spetsai'' and her sisters, had been sailing from the island of [[Imbros]] to the patrol line outside the straits. When the Ottomans were sighted, the Greeks altered course to the northeast in order to block the advance of their opponents. In the ensuing [[Naval Battle of Elli]], the Ottoman ships opened fire first, at 09:50, from a range of about 15,000&nbsp;yards; the Greeks returned fire ten minutes later, by which time the range had decreased significantly to 8,500&nbsp;yards. At 10:04, the Ottoman ships completed a 16-point turn, which reversed their course, and steamed for the safety of the straits in a disorganized withdrawal.<ref name=Fotakis>Fotakis, p. 50</ref> Within an hour, the [[rout]]ed Ottoman ships had withdrawn into the Dardanelles.<ref name=Hall>Hall, pp. 64&ndash;65</ref>

The [[Naval Battle of Lemnos]] resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster ''Georgios Averof'' away from the Dardanelles. The [[protected cruiser]] [[Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye|''Hamidiye'']] evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch ''Georgios Averof'' to hunt down ''Hamidiye''. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach ''Georgios Averof'' from her position. ''Georgios Averof'', ''Spetsai'', and her two sisters appeared approximately 12&nbsp;miles from Lemnos; when the powerful Greek cruiser was spotted, the Ottomans turned to retreat with ''Georgios Averof'' in pursuit. She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase. ''Spetsai'' and her sisters were too slow to keep up with ''Georgios Averof'', and played no active part in the engagement.<ref name=Fotakis/>

At the outbreak of World War I at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], decided to remain neutral. The [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers landed troops in [[Salonika]] in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve for the remainder of the war.<ref name=GG383/> ''Spetsai'' was decommissioned in 1920 and used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was broken up for scrap.<ref>Paizis-Paradellis, p. 166</ref>
