The series also spurred the release of three [[anime|animated]] productions, two full length [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films, and several literary adaptations.

''Final Fantasy'' features several common elements and themes that have appeared in most of the titles. The games also feature many similar gameplay elements. Many titles in the series have been commercially successful and received an overall positive reception. In addition, the series is well known for its visuals, music, innovation, and use of technology. The video game series and several specific games within it have been credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts and features that are widely used in console RPGs.<ref name="GS-FFHistory">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/| title = The History of Final Fantasy| author = Vestal, Andrew| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref><ref name="IGN-GC-RPG">{{cite web| title = State of the RPG: GameCube| url = http://cube.ign.com/articles/634/634965p1.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| author = Casamassina, Matt| date = 2005-07-19| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy'' is the the fourth-[[List of best-selling video games#Franchises|best-selling video game franchise]],<ref name="Edge177"/> with over 75 million units sold worldwide as of March 2007.<ref name="BerlinCon">{{cite web| url = http://www.square-enix.com/eu/en/whatsnew/ffxi_berlin_convention_uk.pdf| title = Experience Final Fantasy XI 2007 at the Berlin eSports Convention| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| accessdate = 2007-09-28}}</ref>

== Overview ==
=== Common elements ===
{{main|Common elements of Final Fantasy}}
Though each ''Final Fantasy'' story is independent, many themes and elements of [[gameplay]] recur throughout the series. The concept of summoning legendary creatures to aid in battle has persisted since ''[[Final Fantasy III]]''; some common summons include Shiva, Ifrit, and Bahamut.<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/> Other common creatures include Chocobos and Moogles, and have appeared in various capacities.<ref name="IGN-Evo">{{cite web| url = http://au.ps2.ign.com/articles/756/756635p1.html| title = The Evolution of Final Fantasy| author = Kolan, Patrick| publisher = [[IGN]]| date = [[2007-01-18]]| accessdate = 2007-11-03}}</ref> Some spin-off titles have cameo appearances of characters from other games. In most cases merely the names are reused, so that each game has its own unique collection of characters in totally unrelated worlds. For example, there has been a character, sometimes playable, named [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]] in each game since ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''.<ref>{{cite web| author = Coik, Kevin| url = http://www.gamingworldx.com/features/thoff-past.shtml| title = The History of Final Fantasy : The Past| publisher = Gaming World X| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> However, the name is the only common thread, as the actual appearance and personalities differ. Various different character classes are another reoccurring theme in the games, and are specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters.<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/><ref name="IGN-Evo"/>

=== Gameplay ===
==== Game screens ====
The ''Final Fantasy'' games typically have several types of screens, or modes of interaction, broadly categorised by function. Screens are accessed either by the player's actions or by the game due to specific events or requirements. Such screens include: ''Battle screens'', ''Field Screens'', ''World Screen'', ''Menu screens'', ''[[Cutscene]]s'', and ''[[Minigame]]s''. The player normally controls the character interaction with the environment via Battle, Field, and World screens; minigames are sometimes used for this as well.

[[Image:FFIV overworld map.PNG|200px|thumb|''Final Fantasy II SNES (US)'' world screen]]
"Battle screens" facilitate battles in an [[arena]], usually with a change of scale and a background that usually generically represents where the battle is occurring in the game. For example, a random battle in a [[desert]] will have a desert backdrop.<ref name="FF-Retro-1">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/22250.html| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part I| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = [[2007-07-15]]| accessdate = 2007-11-03}}</ref> Battles are normally either plot-relevant or [[random encounter]]s. In the past two titles, ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII|XII]]'', battles screens have been omitted by having battle sequences occur on the main field screen.<ref name="FF-Retro-8">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/24494.html| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part VIII| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = [[2007-09-04]]| accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref><ref name="FF-Retro-9">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/25003.html| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part IX| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = [[2007-09-15]]| accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref> "Field screens" are where the main interaction between the characters occurs. Most of the exploration of the world occurs on these screens, as well as most of the dialogue. Exploration is normally done through multiple interconnected field screens. In the first ten titles (except ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''), players could navigate the main character, which represented the whole party, around the environment. Since ''Final Fantasy XI'', multiple characters have been shown in on the Field screen, and battles have been incorporated into the Field screen. 

The "World screen" is a low-scale map of the in-game world used to symbolize traveling great distances that would otherwise slow the plot progression. TThe party can often traverse this screen by means of [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airships]], [[Chocobo]]s, and other modes of transportation.<ref name="FF-Retro-1"/> "Menu Screens" are used for navigating the party's status, equipment, and abilities, as well as accessing the game options.<ref name="IGN-Evo"/> This screen is usually presented in a very simple table layout. "[[Cutscene]]s" are non-interactive playbacks that usually provide instructions for the player or advance the plot. They can either be pre-rendered video, also known as [[full motion video]], or they can be executed with the same engine as any of the first three modes. "[[Minigame]]s" are smaller games within the game. They are not normally required to advance the story of the game. There have been several different types of [[Minigames of Final Fantasy|minigames in ''Final Fantasy'']].

==== Battle system ====
{{main|Final Fantasy battle systems}}
[[Image:Activetimebattle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Screenshot]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'' during a battle. The enlarged bars represent the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system used in several ''Final Fantasy'' installments.]]
Combat in the ''Final Fantasy'' series started with a simple menu-driven, [[Turn-based game|turn-based]] battle system, but later included more real-time and semi-real-time elements as the series progressed.<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/> The series went into complete real-time in ''Final Fantasy XI'' and ''Final Fantasy XII''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r17264.htm| title = Final Fantasy XI Review| publisher = GameZone Online| author = Sandoval, Angelina| date = [[2004-03-30]]| accessdate = 2007-09-30}}</ref><ref name="FFXIIguide">{{cite book |editor=BradyGAMES |title=Final Fantasy XII Official Strategy Guide |year=2006 |publisher=DKPublishing |isbn=0-7440-0837-9 |pages=35<U+2013>36}}</ref> The traditional, turn-based battle system was used in the first three games. At the beginning of each combat round, the player chooses all of the battle commands. These commands would then be carried out, but in an order from the fastest to slowest characters. 

The turn-based battle systems were later replaced by the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] starting with ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', which was, in turn, replaced by the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Conditional Turn-Based|Conditional Turn-Based]] (CTB) system in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', and then finally by [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Real Time Battle|Real Time Battle]] systems starting with ''Final Fantasy XI''. At [[E3]] of 2006, Square Enix presented a short demo of ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'', in which the battles had a battle menu for inputting commands at the bottom of the screen but was not well-noticed because the battles themselves appeared to be completely cinematic in nature.<ref>{{cite web| author=Square Enix| year=2006 | title=E3 2006 - Square Enix ~ Final Fantasy XII| url=http://na.square-enix.com/e306/titles/fabula/ff13| publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>

Most games in the series utilize an [[Experience point|experience level]] system for character advancement. The experience points are normally accumulated in battle. Battles also use a point-based system for casting magical spells. Since ''Final Fantasy III'', most games in the series feature a variety of "special commands", such as the ability to steal items from enemies, or performing a leap attack. Often these special attacks are integrated into the [[Final Fantasy character classes|job system]], which has appeared in several games in the series and spin-offs.

Different examples include ''[[Final Fantasy Mystic Quest]]'', which was developed for a United States audience, and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', which featured numerous references and themes found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games. In [[2003 in video gaming|2003]], the series' first direct sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', was released.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy X-2 - Release Summary| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasyx2/similar.html?mode=versions| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2007-10-03}}</ref> There have been several new series of games that have originated from or are heavily rooted in the ''Final Fantasy'' series.

== Music ==
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy}}
''Final Fantasy'' is the first Japanese-origin video game franchise to mass market its [[soundtrack]]s in the United States. The international popularity of [[video game music]] began to surge with the success of the ''Final Fantasy'' series. [[Nobuo Uematsu]] was the chief [[composer|music composer]] of the ''Final Fantasy'' series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. His music has played a large part in the popularity of the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise abroad. Uematsu is also involved with the rock group [[The Black Mages]], which has released two albums of [[arrangement|arranged]] ''Final Fantasy'' tunes.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://na.square-enix.com/uematsu/profile/index.html| title = Nobuo Uematsu's Profile| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref> Other composers who have contributed to the series include [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Hitoshi Sakimoto]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Artist: <U+6D5C><U+6E26><U+6B63><U+5FD7>| publisher = [[Music Brainz]]| url = http://musicbrainz.org/artist/deff82b2-f269-47fc-b0bc-383a5c911acb.html| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Artist: <U+5D0E><U+5143><U+4EC1>| publisher = [[Music Brainz]]| url = http://musicbrainz.org/artist/53a2cda4-31d0-405e-8a9d-5027c2479ebb.html| accessdate = 2007-10-08}}</ref>

While the music in the games offer wide variety, there are some frequently reused themes. The games often open with a piece called "Prelude", which is a simple [[arpeggio]] theme in the early games, with further melodies added in later games.<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/><ref name="IGN-Evo"/><ref name="FF-Retro-1"/> The battle sequences that end in victory for the player in the first ten installments of the series would be accompanied by a victory fanfare that used the same nine-note sequence to begin the fanfare, and it has become one of the most recognized pieces of music relating to the ''Final Fantasy'' series. Other memorable tunes include the Chocobo's theme, the Moogle's theme, and a piece originally called "Ahead on Our Way" in ''Final Fantasy I'', which was in fact the opening theme and is now usually played during the ending credits of the game and called "Prologue"; in many cases, this theme is also known simply as "Final Fantasy".<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/> Notably in the character-driven ''Final Fantasy'' incarnations, a significant element in each game's musical score is the use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name="Edge177"/> In nearly all ''Final Fantasy'' games, the most important characters and plot elements have their own theme music.

[[Square Co.|Square]] first entered the Japanese [[Computer and video game industry|video game industry]] in the mid [[1980s]], developing a variety of simple [[console role-playing game|RPGs]], [[racing game]]s, and [[platform game|platformers]] for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Famicom Disk System]] (FDS), a disk-based [[peripheral]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]]. By 1987, declining interest in the FDS had placed Square on the verge of [[bankruptcy]]. At approximately the same time, Square designer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] began work on an new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based Famicom, inspired in part by [[Enix]]'s popular ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]''. Sakaguchi had plans to retire after the completion of the project, so it was named ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="IntroSE"/><ref name="HS-MobyG">{{cite web| url = http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,33334/| title = Developer Bio - Hironobu Sakaguchi| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| accessdate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> The name has also been attributed to the company's hopes that the project would help with their financial woes.<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/> ''Final Fantasy'' reversed Square's lagging fortunes,<ref name="IntroSE"/> and became their flagship franchise.<ref name="Edge177"/>

Following the success of the first game, Square began work on a second installment. Unlike a typical sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' featured entirely different characters, with a setting and story bearing only some thematic similarities to its predecessor. Some of the [[gameplay]] elements, such as the [[character advancement]] system, were also completely changed.  This approach to future installments has continued throughout the series, with each major ''Final Fantasy'' game introducing a new world, a new cast of characters, and a new system of gameplay.

=== Design ===

Artistic design, including character and monster design work, was handled by Japanese artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]] from ''Final Fantasy'' through ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', as well as title logo designs for all of the main series and all of the image illustrations from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' onward. Following Amano's departure, he was replaced by [[Tetsuya Nomura]],<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/> who continued to work with the series through ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', with the exception of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', in which character designs were handled by [[Shukou Murase]], Toshiyuki Itahana and Shin Nagasawa.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy9/tech_info.html| title = Final Fantasy IX - Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> Nomura is also the character designer of the ''[[Final Fantasy VII#Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]],'' and all three installments of the upcoming ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy XIII]]''. 

Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and [[Akihiko Yoshida]]. Mihara was the character designer for ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''<ref>{{cite web| author = GameFAQs staff| date = [[2003-11-20]]| title = Final Fantasy XI Info| url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/data/197345.html| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> and Yoshida served as character designer for the spin-off title ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', as well as the Square-produced ''[[Vagrant Story]]''. He has recently became more involved with the series as the character designer of ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' and the ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' remake. [[Kazushige Nojima]] was the series' primary scenario writer since ''Final Fantasy VII''. In October 2003, he resigned from Square Enix to form his own company, [[Stellavista]]. He partially or completely wrote the stories for ''Final Fantasy VII'', ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', ''Final Fantasy X'', and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''. He has also worked as the scenario writer for the spin off series, ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/tech_info.html| title = Kingdom Hearts II Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2007-11-07}}</ref> Square Enix continues to contract story and scenario work to Nojima and Stellavista.

=== Graphics and technology ===
''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Family Computer]] in [[1987 in video gaming|1987]]. It featured small [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] representations of the leading party members on the main world screen because of graphical limitations, while in battle screens, more detailed, full versions of all characters would appear in a side-view perspective. The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] installments used updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality music and sound than in previous games, but they were otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design.

[[Image:FFVII cutscene aeris.jpg|thumb|''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' was the first game in the series to incorporate pre-rendered [[cut scene]]s.]]
Late in the 16-bit generation, Square showed an [[Final Fantasy VI#Interactive CG Game|interactive SGI technical demonstration]] of ''Final Fantasy'' for the next generation.<ref name="FFVII-Dev">{{cite web| author = The Final Fantasy VII Citadel site staff| year = 2005| title = Hironobu Sakaguchi Interview| url = http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_sakaguchi.shtml| publisher = The Final Fantasy VII Citadel| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> Many assumed that it was a precursor to a new ''Final Fantasy'' title for the [[Nintendo 64]] [[video game console]]. [[1997 in video gaming|1997]] saw the release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' for the Sony [[PlayStation]] and not the [[Nintendo 64]] as many had originally anticipated.<ref>{{cite web| author = Sutherland, Kenny| publisher = Lost Levels Online| url = http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/| title = Elusions: Final Fantasy 64| accessdate = 2007-10-02}}</ref> This was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster and more expensive [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]s, as opposed to the slower and cheaper, though higher capacity, [[compact disc]]s used on rival systems.<ref>{{Citation| last=PSM Staff| publication-date=September 2007| date=| title=10 Years of PlayStation Through the Eyes of PSM| periodical=[[PSM (magazine)|PSM]]| publisher= [[Future Publishing|Future US Inc.]]| issue=127| pages=34-43}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy VII'' introduced [[3D computer graphics|3-dimensional graphics]] with fully [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII -Review| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasy7/review.html| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| author = Kasavin, Greg| date = [[1997-09-29]]| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII (PS1) - Review| url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3111173&sec=REVIEWS| publisher = [[1UP.com]]| date = [[2004-05-09]]| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> It was because of this switch to 3D that a [[CD-ROM]] format was chosen over a cartridge format.<ref name="FFVII-Dev"/> 

Starting with ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', the series adopted a more [[photorealism|photo-realistic]] look.<ref name="development2">{{cite web | author=Coxon, Sachi | year=1998 | title=Interview with ''Final Fantasy VIII'' developers | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/ff8iview2.html | work=PlayStation Japan | accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> Like ''Final Fantasy VII'', some [[full motion video]] sequences would have video playing in the background, with the [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygonal]] characters composited on top. ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'' returned briefly to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series. It still maintained, and in many cases slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques utilized in the previous two games in the series. ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]],<ref name="FFX-Releases"/> and made use of the much more powerful hardware to render many cutscenes in real-time, rather than in pre-rendered [[full motion video|FMV]] sequences. Rather than having 3D models moving about in pre-rendered backgrounds, the game featured full 3D environments; giving it a more dynamic look, though the camera angle was fixed. It was also the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to introduce [[voice acting]], occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.<ref>{{cite web| author = Square Enix North America site staff| year = 2001| title = Behind The Game The Creators| url = http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| work = Square Enix.com| accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref>

Taking a temporary divergence, ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' used the PlayStation 2's online capabilities as an [[MMORPG]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/359/359081p1.html| title = Final Fantasy XI -- Big Plans, Big Money| author = IGN Staff| publisher = [[IGN]]| date = [[2002-05-10]]| accessdate = 2007-10-02}}</ref> Initially released for PlayStation 2 with a PC port arriving 6 months later, ''Final Fantasy XI'' was also released on the [[Xbox 360]] nearly four years after its first release in Japan.<ref>{{cite web| title = Shippin' Out 4/17-4/21: Final Fantasy XI Online, Brain Age| url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/longestjourney2wt/news.html?sid=6147765| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| author = Thorsen, Tor| date = [[2006-04-17]]| accessdate = 2007-10-02}}</ref> This was the first ''Final Fantasy'' game to use a free rotating camera.

== Merchandise and other media ==
{{see|List of Final Fantasy media}}
[[Square Enix]] has expanded the ''Final Fantasy'' series into various different mediums. In addition to the games, there have been [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films, animated series, books, and different types of merchandise.<ref name="Edge177"/> Many of the games have been re-released on multiple platforms, and several have been adapted into [[manga]] and [[novel]]s. ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics Advance]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy: Unlimited]]'' have been adapted into [[radio drama]]s. Many of the titles' official soundtracks have been released for sale as well. Companion books, which normally provide in-depth game information, have also been published. In Japan, they are published by Square and are called [[Ultimania]] books. In North America, they take the form of standard [[strategy guide]]s.

=== Anime and films ===
[[Image:Final fantasy ver1.jpg|thumb|130px|Theatrical release poster of ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'']]
There have been several [[anime]] and [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[film]]s produced that are based either directly on individual ''Final Fantasy'' games or on the series as a whole. The first was an [[Original video animation|OVA]] titled ''[[Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals]]'' and was based on ''[[Final Fantasy V]]''. The story was set on the same world as the game though 200 years in the future. It was released as four 30-minute episodes first in Japan in 1994 and later released in the United States by [[Urban Vision]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals (OAV)| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=613| publisher = AnimeNewsNetwork| accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref> In [[2001 in film|2001]], [[Square Pictures]] released their first feature film, ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]''.

=== Literary adaptations ===
Several of the video games have either been adapted into or have had [[spin-off]]s in the form of [[manga]] and [[novel]]s. The first was the novelization of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' in 1989<ref>{{cite web| title = <U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30A4><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30B8><U+30FC>2 <U+5922><U+9B54><U+306E><U+8FF7><U+5BAE>| url = http://books.yahoo.co.jp/book_detail/05959031| work = Yahoo!

== Reception ==
The ''Final Fantasy'' series has been overall critically well received and commercially successful, though each installment has seen different levels of success. As of March 2007, the series has sold over 75 million units worldwide.<ref name="BerlinCon"/> The series and several specific games within it have been credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts and features that are widely used in [[console role-playing game|console RPGs]].<ref name="GS-FFHistory"/><ref name="IGN-GC-RPG"/> In addition, it has been praised for the quality of its visuals and soundtracks. In July 2007, [[Edge (magazine)|''Edge'' magazine]] criticized the series for a number of related titles that include the phrase "''Final Fantasy''" in their titles, which are considered to be not of the same quality as previous titles. They also commented that with the departure of [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the series might be in danger of growing stale.<ref name="Edge177"/> Many ''Final Fantasy'' games have been included in various lists of top games. Two games were listed on [[GameFAQs]]' "The 10 Best Games Ever" contest in Fall 2005, with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' voted as the "Best Game Ever." Six other ''Final Fantasy'' titles were included in the additional 90 games listed.<ref name="gamefaqs2">{{cite web| author = GameFAQs Site Staff | year = 2005| title = Fall 2005: 10-Year Anniversary Contest - The 10 Best Games Ever| url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10 | publisher = [[GameFAQs]]| accessdate = 2007-10-02}}</ref> [[GameFAQs]] has also held a contest for the best video game series ever, with ''Final Fantasy'' being the runner-up, behind ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/bse|title=Summer 2006: Best.
