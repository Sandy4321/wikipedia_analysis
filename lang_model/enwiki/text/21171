The '''Wabash and Erie Canal''' was a shipping [[canal]] that linked the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] to the [[Ohio River]] via an artificial waterway. The canal provided traders with access from the Great Lakes all the way to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Over 460 miles long, it was the longest canal ever built in North America.

The canal known as the Wabash & Erie in the 1850s and thereafter, was actually a combination of four canals: the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] from the [[Maumee River]] near [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Paulding County, Ohio|Junction, Ohio]], the original Wabash and Erie Canal from Junction, Ohio to [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], the Cross Cut Canal from Terre Haute, Indiana to [[Worthington, Indiana]] (Point Commerce), and the Central Canal from Worthington to [[Evansville, Indiana]].

==Construction==
[[Image:Canal design.JPG|thumb|Canal design or prism]] The [[United States Congress]] provided a land grant on March 2, 1827 for the canal's construction. On January 5, 1828, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] accepted the grant and appointed three commissioners.<ref name="grant">Charles R. Poinsatte, <cite>Fort Wayne During the Canal Era 1828-1855</cite> ([Indianapolis:] Indiana Historical Bureau, 1969), 33-34.</ref> These commissioners concluded that the canal would have to extend into [[Ohio]] and petitioned that state to appoint a commission of their own. The state legislature approved the plan and new commissioners appointed. After several legislative battles begun by proponents of the railroad, the Indiana General Assembly approved the borrowing of $200,000 to begin construction. February 22, 1832 ground was broken and construction began.<ref name="Poinsatte2">Poinsatte, 35-36</ref> Construction of the canal reached [[Logansport, Indiana|Logansport]] by 1837.<ref>Poinsatte, 80.</ref>
The [[Panic of 1837]] devastated Indiana's program of [[internal improvements]], but did not stop construction entirely.<ref>Poinsatte, 81.</ref> The canal reached Lafayette by 1843, Terre Haute by 1848 and Evansville by 1853.<ref>Andrew R. L. Cayton, <cite>Frontier Indiana</cite> (Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996), 285.</ref>
During the summer of 1991, the Gronauer Lock was uncovered at [[New Haven, Indiana]], during the construction of I-469. This is the only intact wooden timber lock discovered. Part of the Gronauer Lock is now on display at the [[Indiana State Museum]].

The high-line sections of the canal proved to be high maintenance and the cost of their repair is what eventually led to the collapse of the canal company. The worst offender was the common [[muskrat]] which were plentiful in the area. They would build burrows in the sides of the canal walls and once they tunneled through on the opposite side the water quickly washed out the entire wall of the levee which rendered the canal useless until it could be repaired.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indiana and Indianans|author=Dunn, Jacob Piatt|year=1919|publisher=American Historical Society|page=399}}</ref>

==Operation==
[[Image:Wabash and Erie Canal boat (Delphi).png|thumb|right|A boat on the canal in Delphi.]]
The canal began operation in the summer of 1843. It only operated for about a decade before it became apparent that the canal was not economicially viable. Even when canal boats were operated at extremely slow speeds, the banks rapidly eroded, and the canal had to be constantly dredged to be operable. [[Terre Haute]], Indiana, housed the headquarters of the canal from 1847 through 1876, when the canal lands were sold at an auction conducted by resident trustee Thomas Dowling at the [[Vigo County]] Court House.

The last canalboat on the Wabash Canal made its last docking in 1874 in [[Huntington, Indiana]], but other sections shut down years earlier. In 1887, [[Paulding County, Ohio]] residents put the final nail in the canal system's coffin: unhappy with [[mosquito|mosquitoes]] breeding in the stagnant waters of Six Mile Reservoir, they cut the dike and drained it in the [[Reservoir War]]. There were several other "reservoir wars" during the canal's colorful history over the same issue, including the Clay County Canal War in [[Indiana]].

The right-of-way through Fort Wayne was purchased by the New York, Chicago and Lake Erie Railway (the [[Nickel Plate Road]]) which ran from Buffalo to Chicago. This allowed the railway to run straight through the heart of a major midwestern city without razing a single home. The canal right-of-way was also directly adjacent to downtown, which made the new railway quite convenient for passengers and many businesses. The canal from [[Napoleon, Ohio|Napoleon]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] was paved over to make [[U.S. Route 24]].

==Route==
[[Image:Wabash and Erie Canal map.jpg|thumb|right|The Wabash and Erie canal in [[Indiana]].]]
The Wabash & Erie Canal travels 497 miles from [[Toledo, Ohio]] on [[Lake Erie]] to [[Evansville, Indiana]] on the [[Ohio River]].  Its route takes it along the left bank or north side of the [[Maumee River]] from Toledo to the south side right bank near Defiance, Ohio and eventually to the headwaters at [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].  From here, it follows the historic Indian portage to the [[Wabash River]].  Following the Wabash River, again on its north side, this is now the right bank. The canal heads downstream to Delphi.  At this location, it crosses to the left bank (eastside).  Continuing down the Wabash to [[Terre Haute]], the canal turns southeast from the Wabash, using several other riverways, until reaching the Ohio River in [[Evansville]].

===Maumee River Section===
The [[Miami and Erie Canal]] runs from [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].  The route as far as the Napoleon Bend was used by the Wabash & Erie Canal to reach [[Lake Erie]].  The joint route includes the following towns and cities.

Toledo, '''Bend View Metro park''' (towpath), '''Side Cut Metro park''' (towpath & 3 of 6 locks).  Providence (operating canal section).

Maumee, Waterville, '''Providence/Grand Rapids''' (locks and other canal features), Independence.

'''Defiance'''
At [[Defiance, Missouri|Defiance]], the Miami and Erie Canal crossed the Maumee River and turned south up the [[Auglaize River]].  This route carried the canal southward to the divide with the Great Miami and eventually the Ohio River at Cincinnati.  Meanwhile, the Wabash & Erie Canal continued west along the [[Maumee River]] to the portage at Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The two canals split at [[Junction, Ohio]].

====New Haven-Indiana====
Gronauer Lock No 2 "Wabash and Erie Canal lock was discovered here June 1991 during excavation for highway construction. It was built 1838<U+2013>1840 by Henry Lotz and named for lock keeper Joseph Gronauer. The rare, well-preserved timber-frame design lock measured 115 by 40 feet; lock chamber was 90 by 15 feet; two-thirds of the total structure was excavated and removed."

"Numerous artifacts and 750 pieces of timber were recovered. After extensive preservation treatment, approximately 5 percent of total lock structure is included in an Indiana State Museum Exhibit. Wabash and Erie Canal, America<U+2019>s longest at approximately 460 miles, linked Lake Erie at Toledo, Ohio with Ohio River at Evansville 1853."<ref name="Indiana State Historic Marker">Indiana State Historic Marker</ref>

[[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] is located at an old portage between the Maumee River and the [[Wabash River]].  Here, the canal crossed 5 miles to the Little Wabash River and headed downstream through Indiana.  Since this was the highest point on the canal (i.e. the summit), Fort Wayne became known as the "Summit City."

Other locks were at First St. and Byron St. The Canal was completed from Fort Wayne to Huntington on July 3, 1835, and from Toledo to Evansville, 459 miles, in 1854. The Canal preceded the railroad to Huntington by 20 years, spurring early settlement. The Canal was abandoned in 1873.''<ref name="Indiana State Historic Marker"/>

Here in Delphi, the canal crossed the Wabash from the right bank (northside) to the left bank (southside).  A dam was built across the Wabash River at Pitts to create a slack water area to allow the boats to cross the river without an aqueduct.

===Cross Cut Canal Section===
Eel River Section
Between Terre Haute and Worthington, the canal route left the Wabash River and was legally considered to be the Cross Cut Canal.  This created a link to the Central Canal and a route to Evansville.  Since no other section of the Cross Cut Canal was contemplated nor built, it is considered historically to be part of the Wabash and Erie Canal.

Or the [[Indiana Central Canal]].
[[Image:Indiana Central Canal.JPG|thumbnail|Indiana Central Canal in Indianapolis]]
From Newberry south, the W&E Canal followed the route of the Central Canal.  The Central Canal was planned from Logansport, through Indianapolis and south to Evansville.  Only the section from Newberry south and a few miles in Indianapolis were built.

==Travel==
Travel along the canal was accomplished by canal packets.  There were freight and passenger packets.  The passenger packet consisted of a series of rooms along the length.  Towards the front was the main saloon.  Here meals were taken.  This room was converted into a men's dorm for sleeping.  The ladies saloon was towards the back of the boat.  It was the women's sleeping dorm at night.

Packets were pulled by three horses, oxen, or a mixture of oxen and horses.  The most common problems identified in journals of that time were, heat, mosquitoes, and the close proximity to the other passengers.<ref>Indiana, A History; William E. Willson, Indiana University Press; Bloomington; 1966; pg 178</ref>
