Shakespeare was born and raised in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].

Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1590 and 1613. His early plays were mainly [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] and [[Shakespearean history| histories]], genres he raised to the peak of sophistication and artistry by the end of the sixteenth century. Next he wrote mainly [[Shakespearean tragedy| tragedies]] until 1608, producing plays, such as ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'', considered some of the finest in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote [[Shakespeare's late romances| tragicomedies]] and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime; and in 1623, two of his former acting colleagues published the [[First Folio]], a collected edition of his works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.

Shakespeare was a respected poet and playwright in his own day; but his reputation would not rise to its present heights until the nineteenth century.  The [[Romantics]], in particular, acclaimed his artistry; and [[George Bernard Shaw]] mocked the nineteenth-century reverence of Shakespeare among [[Victorian era| Victorian]]s as "[[bardolatry]]".<ref>Bertolini, John Anthony (1993). ''Shaw and Other Playwrights''. Pennsylvania: Penn State Press, 119. ISBN 027100908X.</ref> In the twentieth century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today, constantly performed and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.

William Shakespeare (also spelled Shaxpere, Shakspere, Shak-speare, and Shake-speare){{Ref_label|c|c|none}} was the son of [[John Shakespeare]], a successful [[glove|glover]] and [[alderman]] originally from [[Snitterfield]], and [[Mary Arden]], the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 14<U+2013>22.</ref>  He was born in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and baptised on [[26 April]] [[1564]].

At the age of 18, Shakespeare married the 26-year-old [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]. The [[consistory court]] of the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Diocese of Worcester]]  issued a marriage licence on [[27 November]] [[1582]]. Two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds the next day as surety that there were no impediments to the marriage.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 77<U+2013>78.</ref> The couple may have arranged the ceremony in some haste, since the Worcester [[chancellor]] allowed the [[Banns of marriage| marriage banns]] to be read once instead of the usual three times.<ref>[[Michael Wood (historian)|Wood, Michael]] (2003).

After the birth of the twins, there are few historical traces of Shakespeare until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. Owing to this gap in the records, scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years".<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 95.</ref> Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many [[wikt:apocryphal| apocryphal]] stories.

=== London and theatrical career ===
It is not known exactly when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592.<ref>[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|Chambers, E.K.]] (1930). ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 287, 292. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/353406&tab=editions OCLC 353406.]</ref> He was well enough known in London by then to be attacked in print by the playwright [[Robert Greene]]: 

<blockquote>...there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his ''Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide'', supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute ''Johannes factotum'', is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.<ref>Greenblatt, 213.</ref></blockquote> 

Scholars differ on the exact meaning of these words,<ref>Greenblatt, 213.<br><U+2022> Schoenbaum, 153.</ref> but most agree that Greene is accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his station in trying to match university-educated writers, such as [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Nashe]] and Greene himself.<ref>Ackroyd, 176.</ref> The phrase "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" refers to a line from ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]''. Along with the pun "Shake-scene", it identifies Shakespeare as Greene<U+2019>s target.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 151<U+2013>52.</ref>

Greene<U+2019>s attack is the first recorded mention of Shakespeare<U+2019>s career in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene<U+2019>s remarks.<ref>Wells, Stanley (2006). ''Shakespeare & Co.'' New York: Pantheon, 28.

''The Elizabethan Stage''. Vol 2. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 208<U+2013>209. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/336379 OCLC 336379.]</ref>

In 1599, a partnership of company members built their own theatre on the south bank of the [[Thames]], which they called the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]]. In 1608, the partnership also took over the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars indoor theatre]]. Records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that the company made him a wealthy man.<ref>Chambers, ''William Shakespeare'', Vol 2: 67<U+2013>71.</ref> In 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, [[New Place]], and in 1605, he invested in a share of the [[parish]] [[tithes]] in Stratford.<ref>Bentley, G.

Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|quarto]] editions from 1594. By 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the [[title page|title pages]].<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 188.<br><U+2022> Kastan, David Scott (1999).

The 1616 edition of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Works'' names him on the cast lists for  ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus, His Fall]]'' (1603).<ref>[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, Joseph Quincy]] (1923). ''A Life of William Shakespeare.''  Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 275. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/1935264 OCLC 1935264.]</ref> The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson<U+2019>s ''[[Volpone]]'' is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.<ref>Wells, ''Shakespeare & Co.'', 28.</ref> However, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after then, although we cannot know for certain what roles he played.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 200.</ref> In 1610, [[John Davies of Hereford]] wrote that "good Will" played "kingly" roles.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 200<U+2013>201.</ref> In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father.<ref>Rowe, N., ''Account''.</ref> Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in ''[[As You Like It]]'' and the Chorus in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'',<ref>Ackroyd, 357.<br><U+2022> Wells, ''Oxford Shakespeare'', xxii.</ref> though scholars doubt the sources of the information.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 202<U+2013>3.</ref> 

Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford during his career. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the [[parish]] of St. Helen's, [[Bishopsgate]], north of the River Thames.<ref>Honan, Park (1998). ''Shakespeare: A Life''. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 121. ISBN 0198117922.</ref> He moved across the river to [[Southwark]] by 1599, the year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.<ref>Shapiro, 122.</ref> By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] with many fine houses. There he rented rooms from a French [[Huguenot]] called Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.<ref>Honan, 325; Greenblatt, 405.</ref> In 1612, he was called as a witness in a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary.<ref>Honan, 326.<br><U+2022> Ackroyd, 462<U+2013>464.</ref> In March 1613, he bought a [[gatehouse]] in the Blackfriars [[priory]];<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 272<U+2013>274.</ref> and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, [[John Hall (physician)|John Hall]].<ref>Honan, 387.</ref>

After 1606<U+2013>7, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 279.</ref> His last three plays were collaborations, probably with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]],<ref>Honan, 375<U+2013>78.</ref> who succeeded him as the house playwright for the King<U+2019>s Men.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 276.</ref>

=== Death ===

[[Image:ShakespeareMonument cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shakespeare's funerary monument]] in Stratford-upon-Avon]]

Rowe was the first biographer to pass down the tradition that Shakespeare retired to Stratford some years before his death;<ref name="Ac">Ackroyd, 476.</ref> but [[retiring| retirement]] from all work was uncommon at that time,<ref>Honan, 382<U+2013>83.</ref> and Shakespeare continued to visit London.<ref name="Ac">Ackroyd, 476.</ref> He died on [[23 April]] [[1616]],<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 25, 296.</ref> and was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 287.</ref> and Judith had married [[Thomas Quiney]], a [[vintner]],  two months before Shakespeare<U+2019>s death.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 292, 294.</ref>

In his will, Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 304.</ref> The terms instructed that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body".<ref>Honan, 395<U+2013>96.</ref> The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.<ref>Chambers, ''William Shakespeare'', Vol 2: 8, 11, 104.<br><U+2022> Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 296.</ref> The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare<U+2019>s direct line.<ref>Chambers, ''William Shakespeare'', Vol 2: 7, 9, 13.<br><U+2022> Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 289, 318-19.</ref> Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one third of his estate automatically. He did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation.<ref>Ackroyd, 483.<br><U+2022>  [[Roland Frye|Frye, Roland Mushat]] (2005 ).

Shakespeare was buried in the [[chancel]] of the [[Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon|Holy Trinity Church]] two days after his death.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 306<U+2013>07.<br><U+2022> Wells, ''Oxford Shakespeare'', xviii.</ref> Sometime before 1623, a [[Shakespeare's funeral monument| monument]] was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing.

Scholars have often noted four periods in Shakespeare's writing career.<ref>[[Edward Dowden|Dowden, Edward]] (1881). ''Shakspere''. New York: Appleton & co, 48<U+2013>9. [http://worldcat.org/oclc/8164385 OCLC 8164385.]</ref> Until the mid-1590s, he wrote mainly comedies influenced by Roman and Italian models and history plays in the popular chronicle tradition. His second period began in about 1595 with the tragedy ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ended with the tragedy of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1599. During this time, he wrote what are considered his greatest comedies and histories. From 1600 to 1608, his "tragic period", Shakespeare wrote mostly tragedies, and from about 1608 to 1613, mainly [[tragicomedy|tragicomedies]], also called [[Shakespeare's late romances|romances]].

The first recorded works of Shakespeare are ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and the three parts of ''[[Henry VI Part 1| Henry VI]]'', written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date, however,<ref>Frye, 9.<br><U+2022> Honan, 166.</ref> and studies of the texts suggest that ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' may also belong to Shakespeare<U+2019>s earliest period.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 159<U+2013>61.<br><U+2022> Frye, 9.</ref> His first [[Shakespearean history| histories]], which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of [[Raphael Holinshed| Raphael Holinshed's]] ''Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland'',<ref>Dutton, Richard; and Jean Howard (2003).

His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.<ref>Shapiro, 150.<br><U+2022>  Gibbons, Brian (1993).

Shakespeare's so-called "tragic period" lasted from about 1600 to 1608, though he had written [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]] before this and also wrote the so-called [[Problem plays (Shakespeare)| "problem plays"]]  ''[[Measure for Measure]] '' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well| All's Well That Ends Well]]''.<ref>[[Andrew Cecil Bradley|Bradley, A.

In his final period, Shakespeare turned to [[Shakespeare's late romances| romance]] or [[tragicomedy]] and completed three more major plays: ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]''.

It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays.

After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new [[James I of England|King James]]. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between [[1 November]] [[1604]] and [[31 October]] [[1605]], including two performances of ''The Merchant of Venice''.<ref>Wells, ''Oxford Shakespeare'', xxii.</ref> After 1608, they performed at the indoor [[Blackfriars Theatre]] during the winter and the Globe during the summer.<ref>Foakes, 33.</ref> The indoor setting, combined with the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]<!--or perhaps [[Jacobean literature]]?--> fashion for lavishly staged [[masques]], allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In ''Cymbeline'', for example, Jupiter descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt.

The actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous [[Richard Burbage]], [[William Kempe]], [[Henry Condell]] and [[John Heminges]]. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including ''Richard III'', ''Hamlet'', ''Othello'',  and ''King Lear''.<ref>Ringler, William Jr. (1997)."Shakespeare and His Actors: Some Remarks on King Lear".

In 1623, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's Men, published the [[First Folio]], a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays.

== Poems ==
In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], Shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]''. He dedicated them to [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Henry Wriothesley, earl of Southampton]]. In ''Venus and Adonis'', an innocent [[Adonis]] rejects the sexual advances of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]; while in ''The Rape of Lucrece'', the virgin [[Lucretia|Lucrece]] is raped by the lustful [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]].<ref>Rowe, John; Brian Gibbons; and A.R.

Published in 1609, the ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'' were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.<ref>Wood, 178.<br><U+2022> Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 180.</ref> Even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in ''The Passionate Pilgrim'' in 1599, [[Francis Meres]] had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's "sugred Sonnets among his private friends".<ref>Honan, 180.</ref> Few analysts believe that the published collection follows Shakespeare's intended sequence.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 268.</ref> He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about pure love for a fair young man (the "fair youth"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial "I" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though [[Wordsworth]] believed that with the sonnets "Shakespeare unlocked his heart".<ref>Honan, 180.<br><U+2022> Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 180.</ref> The 1609 edition was dedicated to a "Mr. W.H.", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems. It is not known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, [[Thomas Thorpe]], whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories, or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication.<ref>Schoenbaum, ''Compact'', 268<U+2013>269.</ref> Critics praise the ''Sonnets'' as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.<ref>Wood, 177.</ref>

==Style==
{{main|Shakespeare's style}}

Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.<ref>Clemen, Wolfgang (2005). ''Shakespeare's Dramatic Art: Collected Essays'', 150. London; New York: Routledge. ISBN 0415352789.</ref> The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical<U+2014>written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' has been described as stilted.<ref>Frye, 105, 177.<br><U+2022>   Clemen, Wolfgang (2005). ''Shakespeare's Imagery''.  London; New York: Routledge, 29. ISBN 0415352800.</ref> 

Soon, however, Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening [[soliloquy]] of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' has its roots in the self-declaration of [[the Vice|Vice]] in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard<U+2019>s vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.<ref>Brooke, Nicholas, "Language and Speaker in Macbeth", 69; and [[M. C. Bradbrook|Bradbrook, M.C.]], "Shakespeare's Recollection of Marlowe", 195: both in ''Shakespeare's Styles: Essays in Honour of Kenneth Muir''. Edwards, Philip; Inga-Stina Ewbank, and G.K. Hunter (eds.) (2004 edition). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521616948.</ref> No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.<ref>Clemen, ''Shakespeare's Imagery'', 63.</ref> By the time of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

[[Image:Pity.jpg|thumb|''Pity'' by [[William Blake]], 1795, [[Tate Britain]], is an illustration of two similes in ''Macbeth'': "And pity, like a naked new-born babe, / Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd / Upon the sightless couriers of the air".]]

Shakespeare's standard poetic form was [[blank verse]], composed in [[iambic pentameter]]. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the [[End-stopping|end of lines]], with the risk of monotony.<ref>Frye, 185.</ref> Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Shakepeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:<ref>''Hamlet'', Act 5, Scene 2, 4<U+2013>8. Wright, George T (2004). "The Play of Phrase and Line". In ''Shakespeare: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, 1945-2000''. Russ McDonald (ed.). Oxford: Blackwell, 868. ISBN 0631234888.</ref>

:''Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting''
:''That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay''
:''Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly<U+2014>''
:''And prais'd be rashness for it<U+2014>let us know'' 
:''Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well...''

After ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic [[A. C. Bradley]] described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".<ref>Bradley, 91.</ref> In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included [[enjambment|run-on lines]], irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.<ref name="McDxxxxii">McDonald, 42<U+2013>6.</ref> In ''[[Macbeth]]'', for example, the language darts from one metaphor to another ("was the hope drunk when you dressed yourself"; "pity, like a naked new-born babe"). The listener is challenged to complete the sense.<ref name="McDxxxxii">McDonald, 42<U+2013>6.</ref> The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.<ref>McDonald, 36, 39, 75.</ref>

Shakespeare's poetic genius was allied with a practical sense of the theatre.<ref>Gibbons, 4.</ref> Like all playwrights of the time, Shakespeare dramatised stories from sources such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Holinshed]].<ref name="Gibbons">Gibbons, 1<U+2013>4.</ref> He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.<ref>Gibbons, 1<U+2013>7, 15.</ref> As Shakespeare<U+2019>s mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In his [[Shakespeare's late romances|late romances]], he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.<ref>McDonald, 13.<br><U+2022>   Meagher, John C (2003).

Shakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature. In particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of [[characterisation]], [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[language]], and [[genre]].<ref>Chambers, E. K (1944). ''Shakespearean Gleanings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 35.

Between the [[The Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the seventeenth century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[Ben Jonson]].<ref>Grady, ''Shakespeare Criticism'', 269.</ref> [[Thomas Rymer]], for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. But poet and critic [[John Dryden]] rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, "I admire him, but I love Shakespeare".<ref>[[John Dryden|Dryden, John]] (1668). "An Essay of Dramatic Poesy". Cited by Grady in ''Shakespeare Criticism'', 269; For the full quotation, see [[Harry Levin|Levin, Harry]] (1986). "Critical Approaches to Shakespeare from 1660 to 1904". In ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare Studies''. Wells, Stanley (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 215. ISBN 0521318416.</ref> For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the eighteenth century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius.  A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1765 and [[Edmond Malone]] in 1790, added to his growing reputation.<ref>Grady, ''Shakespeare Criticism'', 270<U+2013>271.<br><U+2022>   Levin, 217.</ref> By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.<ref>Dobson, Michael (1992).

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], Shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]; and the critic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] translated his plays in the spirit of [[German Romanticism]].<ref>Levin, 223.</ref> In the nineteenth century, critical admiration for Shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.<ref>Sawyer, Robert (2003).

He claimed that the new [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] plays had made Shakespeare obsolete.<ref>Grady, ''Shakespeare Criticism'', 276.</ref>

The modernist revolution in the arts during the early twentieth century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the [[avant garde]]. The [[German expressionism|Expressionists]] in Germany and the [[Futurism (art)|Futurists]] in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director [[Bertolt Brecht]] devised an [[epic theatre]] under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's "primitiveness" in fact made him truly modern.<ref>Grady, Hugh (2001). "Modernity, Modernism and Postmodernism in the Twentieth Century's Shakespeare".

=== Religion ===

=== Sexuality ===

{{main|Sexuality of William Shakespeare}}

Few details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married the 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on [[26 May]] [[1583]]. Scholars have pointed to Shakespeare's sonnets, particularly the twenty-six so-called [[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|"Dark Lady"]] sonnets addressed to a married woman, as evidence of affairs with women.<ref>Fort, J. A. "The Story Contained in the Second Series of Shakespeare's Sonnets." ''The Review of English Studies''. (Oct 1927) 3.12, 406<U+2013>414.</ref> In recent decades, some scholars have claimed to find hints in Shakespeare's work that he was [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense [[friendship]] rather than sexual love.<ref>Casey, Charles (Fall 1998).

===Classification of the plays===
[[Image:Gilbert Shakespeares Plays.jpg|thumb|right|''The Plays of William Shakespeare''. By [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], 1849.]]

Shakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the [[First Folio]] of 1623, listed below according to their folio classification as [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]], [[Shakespearean history|histories]] and [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]].<ref>Boyce, Charles (1996). ''Dictionary of Shakespeare''. Ware, Herts, UK: Wordsworth, 91, 193, 513. ISBN 1853263729.</ref> Shakespeare did not write every word of the plays attributed to him; and several show signs of collaboration, a common practice at the time.<ref>Thomson, Peter (2003). "Conventions of Playwriting". In ''Shakespeare: an Oxford Guide''. Stanley Wells and Lena Cowen Orlin (eds). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 49. ISBN 0199245223.</ref> Two plays not included in the First Folio, ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', are now accepted as part of the canon, with scholars agreed that Shakespeare made a major contribution to their composition.<ref>Kathman, 629.<br><U+2022> Boyce, 91.</ref> No poems were included in the First Folio.

In the late nineteenth century, [[Edward Dowden]] classified four of the late comedies as [[Shakespeare's late romances|romances]], and though many scholars prefer to call them [[Tragicomedy|''tragicomedies]]'', his term is often used.<ref>Edwards, Phillip (1958). "Shakespeare's Romances, 1900<U+2013>1957." ''Shakespeare Survey'' 11: 1<U+2013>10.<br><U+2022> Snyder, Susan, and Curren-Aquino, Deborah, T (eds.) (2007). ''The Winter's Tale''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Introduction. ISBN 0521221587.</ref> These plays and the associated ''Two Noble Kinsmen'' are marked with an asterisk (*) below. In 1896, [[Frederick S. Boas]] coined the term "[[problem plays]]" to describe four plays: ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>Schanzer, Ernest (1963). ''The Problem Plays of Shakespeare.'' London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1<U+2013>10. ISBN 041535305X.</ref> "Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies", he wrote. "We may therefore borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays."<ref>[[Frederick S. Boas| Boas, F.S]] (1896), ''Shakspere and his Predecessors'', 345. Quoted by Schanzer, 1.</ref> The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though ''Hamlet'' is definitively classed as a tragedy.<ref>Schanzer, 1.<br><U+2022> [[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]] (1999). ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human.'' New York: Riverhead Books, 325<U+2013>380. ISBN 157322751X.<br><U+2022> Berry, Ralph (2005). ''Changing Styles in Shakespeare''.  London; New York: Routledge, 37. ISBN 0415353165.</ref> The other problem plays are marked below with a double dagger (<U+2021>).

Plays thought to be only partly written by Shakespeare are marked with a dagger (<U+2020>) below. Other works occasionally attributed to him are listed as lost plays or apocrypha.
