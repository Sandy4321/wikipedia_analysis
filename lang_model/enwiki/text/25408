'''Josef Carl Peter Jacobs''' (15 May 1894 <U+2013> 29 July 1978) was a German [[flying ace]] with 48 victories during the First World War. His total tied him with [[Werner Voss]] for fourth place among German aces.

==Background==
Josef Carl Peter Jacobs was born in Kreuzkapelle, [[Rhineland]], [[German Empire]] on 15 May 1894,<!--presumably [[:de:Kreuzkapelle (Much)]]--> and learned to fly in 1912,<ref name=lines135>Franks et al 1993, pp. 135-136.</ref> aged 18.  As a schoolboy in [[Bonn]], he had been fascinated by the activities he saw at the nearby [[Flying training|flying school]] in Hangelar. There he learned to fly, under the tutelage of Bruno Werntgen.<ref name="vW">van Wyngarden, ''Early German Aces'', p.54-55</ref> When war broke out, he joined up for the [[Luftstreitkr<U+00E4>fte|Imperial German Army Air Service]] to train as a [[aviator|pilot]] with ''Fliegerersatz-Abteilung'' (Replacement Detachment) 9.<ref name=lines135/>

==Military service==
===1915 <U+2013> 1916===
On 3 July 1915, Jacobs was posted to FA 11 (a [[reconnaissance]] squadron) for a year, flying long-range sorties over Allied lines, his first flight occurring the evening of his arrival. His first victory over a [[France|French]] [[Caudron]] occurred in February 1916, however, it was unconfirmed, due to lack of independent witnesses. After leave in April, Jacobs was posted to ''[[Fokkerstaffel-West]]'' to fly a [[Fokker E.III]] ''Eindecker'' and he finally achieved his first official victory, over an enemy aircraft on 12 May when he shot down a two-seater [[Caudron]] crewed only by its pilot.<ref name="vW"/> At the end of July, Jacobs and his unit had been pulled back for what became a month's aerial bodyguard duty, protecting General Headquarters at [[Charleville-Mezi<U+00E8>res|Charleville]]. On 1 September, Jacobs left this duty that disgusted him, and returned to a front line assignment flying a [[Fokker E.III]]. On the 19th, he upgraded to a [[Fokker D.II]]. His old comrade in arms, [[Max Ritter von Mulzer]], died in a crash a week later. On the 29th, Jacobs fell ill from dysentery; the sickness waylayed him for several weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |pages= 82<U+2013>83 }}</ref>

''Fokker Staffel West'' became [[Jasta 12]] on 6 October 1916, and Jacobs remained with it, although a month later he transferred to [[Jasta 22]], then under the command of Oberleutnant Erich H<U+00F6>nemanns, who was a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=''Early German Aces of World War I'' |page= 83 }}</ref>

===1917 <U+2013> 1918===
He achieved his second victory (this time over a Caudron RIV) in January 1917. He achieved three officially confirmed and eight more unconfirmed victories whilst at ''Jasta'' 22, where he remained until 2 August 1917, when he transferred to [[Jasta 7]] as its [[Staffelf<U+00FC>hrer]] (commander).<ref name=lines135/>

From early 1918 onwards, Jacobs started flying the [[Fokker Dr.I]] [[triplane]] with Jasta 7, and had his aircraft finished in a distinctive black scheme. The Dr I was his favoured mount until October 1918 and he used its manouevibility to his advantage, becoming the triplane's highest scoring ace, with over 30 confirmed victories.<ref name=lines135/>

Jacobs' victory tally slowly rose, until at 24 victories (achieved on July 19, 1918) he was awarded the coveted ''[[Pour le M<U+00E9>rite]]''. Jacobs would remain with ''Jasta'' 7 until the armistice; his final victory tally was 48 enemy aircraft and balloons.  Jacobs continued to fight against the [[Bolshevik]] forces in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] area in 1919, with [[Gotthard Sachsenberg]] and [[Theo Osterkamp]] in ''Kommando Sachsenberg''.<ref name=lines135/>

==Post World War I==
After combat against the [[Spartakists]], Jacobs briefly became a flying instructor in the [[Turkey|Turkish]] Army, before completely withdrawing from military activity. He became a director in the [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]] works and later owned his own aircraft manufacturing company in Erfurt in the 1930s. In addition to aviation, Jacobs was a keen participant in bob sleighing and car and speedboat racing.<ref name=lines135/> 

When the [[NSDAP]] came into power he became a Major in the Reserves,<ref name=lines135/>  although refused to join the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' after being asked by [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]].{{cn|date=February 2013}} Jacobs moved his company to the [[Netherlands]], and at one stage went into hiding, after refusing to let G<U+00F6>ring become a major shareholder in his company.<ref name=lines135/> 

Jacobs moved to [[Bavaria]] after World War II. He owned a [[crane (machine)|crane]] operation, became president of The German Bobsleigh Society, and aided aviation historians of World War I. He died in [[Munich]] on 29 July 1978.<ref name=lines135/>
