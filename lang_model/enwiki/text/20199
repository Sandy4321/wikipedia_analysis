==Major League career==
Killefer made his major league debut on September 13, {{By|1909}} with the [[1909 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]].<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/> After the [[1910 St. Louis Browns season|1910]] season in which the Browns finished in last place, Killefer was released to the [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]].<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> Under the tutelage of Bisons manager, [[George Stallings]], Killefer developed into a refined catcher.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> 

His contract was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies on August 19, [[1911 Philadelphia Phillies season|1911]], and he played his first game as a starter on October 3rd.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> The Phillies pitcher on that day was Grover Cleveland Alexander and the game marked the first of 250 times the pair teamed up as a [[Battery (baseball)|battery]] in the major leagues.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> Although he was a light-hitter, Killefer became known for his strong defensive skills.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> In [[1913 Philadelphia Phillies season|1913]], he led [[National League]] catchers with 166 [[Assist (baseball)|assists]], 130 baserunners [[caught stealing]], a 50.6% caught stealing percentage, and finished second in [[putout]]s and [[fielding percentage]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1913-fielding-leaders.shtml 1913 National League Fielding Leaders at Baseball Reference]</ref>

In {{By|1914}}, Killefer made news when it was reported that he had signed with the [[Chicago Whales]] of the [[Federal League]], although he denied the report.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> When the Phillies offered him a salary increase, he decided to sign with the Phillies, which led the Federal League to file a lawsuit against him and the Phillies.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/> A judge ruled against the Federal League and Killefer remained with the Phillies.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/>

From [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|1915]] to [[1917 Philadelphia Phillies season|1917]], Alexander and Killefer solidified their reputation as the best battery in baseball, with Alexander posting three consecutive 30-win seasons.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/alexape01.shtml Grover Cleveland Alexander at Baseball Reference]</ref> Killefer had one of his best seasons for the Phillies in 1917.

After the {{By|1917}} season, in one of the most lopsided trades in major league history, the financially-strapped Phillies sent Killefer and Alexander to the Chicago Cubs for two players and $55,000 in cash.<ref name="Bill Killefer at The Baseball Biography Project"/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=6TMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=bill+killefer+baseball+digest&lr=&cd=3#v=onepage&q=bill%20killefer%20baseball%20digest&f=false Baseball Digest, October 1987, Vol. 46, No. 10, ISSN 0005-609X]</ref> With the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], Killefer was credited with strengthening their pitching staff.<ref name="''Babe Ruth and the 1918 Red Sox''">[http://books.google.com/books?id=MA-DAzLDuZkC&pg=PA241&dq=bill+killefer&lr=&cd=27#v=onepage&q=bill%20killefer&f=false ''Babe Ruth and the 1918 Red Sox'', Allan Wood, iUniverse, 2000, ISBN 0595148263, 9780595148264]</ref> The Cubs won the {{By|1918}} National League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] before losing to the [[1918 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1918 World Series|World Series]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1918_WS.shtml 1918 World Series at Baseball Reference]</ref> Killefer had another strong season in [[1919 Chicago Cubs season|1919]], hitting a career-high .286 batting average and leading National League catchers in fielding percentage, putouts and assists.<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1919-fielding-leaders.shtml 1919 National League Fielding Leaders at Baseball Reference]</ref> He served as [[player-manager]] for the Cubs in [[1921 Chicago Cubs season|1921]] before retiring as a player at age 33.

In a 13 year career, Killefer played in 1035 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 751 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 3150 [[at bats]] for a .238 career batting average along with 4 [[home run]]s and 240 [[runs batted in]].<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/> He had a career fielding percentage of .977.<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/> While he wasn't a powerful [[Batting (baseball)|hitter]], he possessed a strong throwing arm and a talent for working with pitchers.<ref name="''Babe Ruth and the 1918 Red Sox''"/> Killefer led [[National League]] catchers in [[fielding percentage]] four consecutive seasons from [[1916 Philadelphia Phillies season|1916]] to [[1919 Chicago Cubs season|1919]].<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LSsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86&dq=july+2001+fielding+leaders+baseball+digest&cd=4#v=onepage&q=july%202001%20fielding%20leaders%20baseball%20digest&f=false Baseball Digest, July 2001, Vol. 60, No. 7, ISSN 0005-609X]</ref> He also led the league three times in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing.<ref name="Bill Killefer at Baseball Reference"/> His reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the [[Deadball Era]], catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]]s and [[stolen base]] attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the [[spitball]] pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9S0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=baseball+digest+defensive+catchers#v=onepage&q=baseball%20digest%20defensive%20catchers&f=false ''For Catchers, The Name of the Game is Defense'', by George Vass, Baseball Digest, May 2005, Vol. 64, No. 3, ISSN 0005-609X]</ref> Richard Kendall of the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] devised an unscientific study that ranked Killefer as the most dominating fielding catcher in major league history.<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/bb_catchers/catchers/dominate.htm Dominating Fielding Catchers at The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers]</ref>
