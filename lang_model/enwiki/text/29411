The '''Common Firecrest''', ''Regulus ignicapilla'', also known as the '''Firecrest''', is a very small [[passerine]] bird in the [[kinglet]] family. It breeds in most of [[Temperateness|temperate]] Europe and northwestern Africa, and is partially [[bird migration|migratory]], with birds from central Europe wintering to the south and west of their breeding range. Firecrests in the [[Balearic Islands]] and north Africa are widely recognised as a separate [[subspecies]], but the population on [[Madeira]], previously also treated as a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species, the [[Madeira Firecrest]], ''Regulus madeirensis''. A fossil ancestor of the Firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone.

This kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts. It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white [[supercilium]]. The head crest, orange in the male and yellow in the female, is [[display (zoology)|displayed]] during breeding, and gives rise to the English and scientific names for the species. This bird superficially resembles the [[Goldcrest]], which largely shares its European range, but the Firecrest's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The [[Bird vocalization|song]] is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly lower-pitched than those of its relative.

The Common Firecrest breeds in [[Flowering plant|broadleaved]] or [[pinophyta|coniferous]] woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Seven to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone. Both parents feed the chicks, which [[fledge]] 22<U+2013>24 days after hatching. This kinglet is constantly on the move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of [[tit (bird)|tits]]. Despite some possible local declines, the species is not the subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large European population and an expansion of its range over the last century. It may be hunted and killed by [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], and can carry parasites. It is possible that this species was the original "king of the birds" in European folklore.

== Description ==

The Common Firecrest is a small plump bird, 9&nbsp;cm (3.5&nbsp;in) in length with a wingspan of 13<U+2013>16&nbsp;cm (5.1<U+2013>6.3&nbsp;in),<ref name=BWP/> and weighs 4<U+2013>7&nbsp;g (0.15<U+2013>0.25&nbsp;oz). It has bright olive-green upperparts with a bronze-coloured patch on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with brownish-grey on the breast and flanks. It has two white wingbars, a tiny black pointed bill, and brownish-black legs. The head pattern is striking, with a black eye stripe, long white [[supercilium]], and a crest which is bright yellow in the female and mainly orange in the male. The sexes are very similar, apart from the crest colour, although the female is a little duller in [[plumage]] and on average slightly smaller. Juveniles have a grey tinge to the duller upperparts, and lack the coloured crown; the other head markings are present, but duller than in the adult. By their first winter, only the [[flight feather|flight]] and tail feathers remain [[moulting|unmoulted]], and the young birds are virtually indistinguishable from the adults in the field. This kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally, and its flight is weak and whirring, with occasional quick evasive turns.<ref name= Baker/>

Adult Firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species; [[Pallas's Warbler]] has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white. The juvenile Common Firecrest might be confused with the Goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages.<ref name= Baker/> The Firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's Warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump. There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile Firecrest with the [[Yellow-browed Warbler]], which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs. The Yellow-browed Warbler also lacks the pale half circle present below the young Firecrest's eye.<ref name= Barthel>{{cite journal || last= Barthel | first= Peter H | year=2003 | title= Juvenile firecrests ''Regulus ignicapilla'' as a confusion risk with yellow-browed ''Phylloscopus inornatus'' and Pallas's warblers ''P. proregulus'' | journal= Limicola | volume= 17 | issue = 3 |language = German | pages= 139<U+2013>151}}</ref>

=== Voice ===
The [[Bird vocalization|contact call]] is three or four thin high notes, similar to that of Goldcrest, but slightly lower in pitch,<ref name= Mullarney>{{cite book | last = Mullarney | first = Killian | coauthors = Svensson, Lars; Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter |title = Collins Bird Guide | year = 1999 | publisher = London: Collins | page = 336| isbn = 000219728-6}}</ref> ''zit-zit-zit'' rather than ''see-see-see''.<ref name= Simms/> The song is a succession of call notes in a longer and slightly more varied sequence. Typically there are 11<U+2013>14 notes per song, becoming louder and faster, with the final three notes slightly different from the preceding ones: ''zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zirt.zirt.zirt''. The song usually lasts 0.5<U+2013>2.5 seconds, shorter than the 3.5<U+2013>4.0 seconds for the Goldcrest, and may be repeated up to eight times a minute. In May and June, singing is most frequent after dawn, but continues less often throughout the day. Later in the breeding season, song becomes largely confined to the morning.<ref name= Simms/>

The song of the Mediterranean subspecies of Common Firecrest, ''R.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;balearicus'', is very similar to that of the [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate]] form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran Firecrest from Common Firecrest is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls. Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more [[harmonic]]s than those of the continental subspecies.<ref name= Constantine>{{cite book | last = Constantine | first = Mark | coauthors= The Sound Approach| title = The Sound Approach to Birding: A Guide to Understanding Bird Sound | year = 2006 | location = Poole |  publisher = The Sound Approach | isbn =9081093312 |page =137 }}</ref><ref name= Packert>{{cite journal | last= P<U+00E4>ckert | first= Martin | coauthors = Martens, Jochen; Hofmeister, Tanja | month= January | year= 2001 | title= Laut<U+00E4>u<U+00DF>erungen der Sommergoldh<U+00E4>hnchen von den Inseln Madeira und Mallorca (''Regulus ignicapillus madeirensis, R. i. balearicus'') | journal= Journal f<U+00FC>r Ornithologie |language = German | volume= 142| issue = 1 | pages= 16<U+2013>29 | doi =  }}</ref> Male Goldcrests and Madeiran Firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the Common Firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, because the songs of the Common Firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.<ref name= Simms/><ref name= Packert/>

There are two widely recognised subspecies of Common Firecrest, nominate ''R.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;ignicapilla'' and Mediterranean ''R.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;balearicus'' (Jordans, 1923).

There are a few [[Pleistocene]] (2.6&nbsp;million to 12,000&nbsp;years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant ''Regulus'' species, mostly Goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of Firecrest. A left [[ulna]] from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil  species, ''[[Regulus bulgaricus]]'', from 2.6&ndash;1.95&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|mya]].

== Distribution and habitat ==

[[File:Cork oak.jpg|thumb|Cork woodland is favoured for breeding.]]
The Common Firecrest breeds in lowland [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|broadleaf forest]], preferring [[Quercus suber|cork oak]] and [[alder]] where available, otherwise [[beech]] and [[holly]]. It also uses mixed broadleaf and [[pinophyta|conifer]] woodland, and stands of [[spruce]], [[abies alba|European silver fir]], [[Cedrus|cedar]] and [[pine]]s, often with undergrowth of [[juniper]], [[ivy]] and wild [[rose]]. In drier [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to 2,800&nbsp;m (9,200&nbsp;ft).<ref name= Baker/> Unlike more specialised birds such as [[Eurasian Nuthatch]] and [[Eurasian Treecreeper|Common Treecreeper]], both of which forage on trunks, the crests do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size.<ref name= Teller<U+00ED>a>{{cite journal | last= Telleria | first= J L  | coauthors= Santos, T  | year=1995 | title= Effects of forest fragmentation on a guild of wintering passerines: the role of habitat selection | journal = Biological Conservation | volume= 71 | pages= 61<U+2013>67 | url =http://www.ucm.es/info/zoo/bcv/pdf/1995_BiolCons_71_61.pdf |format = PDF}}</ref> In winter it is less reliant on conifers than the Goldcrest, moving from forest to fringes and scrub.

The nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and southern Latvia.

The Common Firecrest is [[monogamy|monogamous]]. The male sings during the breeding season, often with its crest raised, and has a [[display (zoology)|display]]  which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern. This differs from the display of the plainer-faced Goldcrest, which bows its head to emphasise the crest. The breeding territory is about 0.5&nbsp;hectares (1.2&nbsp;acres), and may overlap with neighbouring Goldcrest territories. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against Goldcrests with the crest raised and a great deal of wing-fluttering,<ref name= Simms/> but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between the species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other;<ref name= Becker>{{cite journal | last= Becker | first= Peter H | year= 1977 | title= Verhalten auf Laut<U+00E4>u<U+00DF>erungen der Zwillingsart, interspezifische Territorialit<U+00E4>t und Habitatanspr<U+00FC>che von Winter- und Sommergoldh<U+00E4>hnchen (''Regulus regulus'', ''R. ignicapillus'') |language = German | journal= Journal f<U+0169>r Ornithologie | volume= 118 | issue = 3 | pages= 233<U+2013>260 | doi = 10.1007/BF01643534 }}</ref> in other circumstances, the two kinglets learned to ignore each other's songs.

Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young.<ref name=BWP/> This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has a life expectancy of less than two years.<ref name = BTO/>

Although their ranges overlap substantially, [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] between Goldcrests and Firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female Goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male Firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.<ref name =hbw/>

=== Feeding ===

[[File:Orchesella cincta.jpg|upright|thumb|Firecrest parents mainly feed young chicks during their first four days of life with [[springtail]]s (average length 4&nbsp;mm) after which time larger food items are given as the chicks grow.]]
All species of kinglet are almost exclusively [[insectivore|insectivorous]], preying on small [[arthropod]]s with soft [[cuticle]]s, such as [[springtail]]s, [[aphid]]s and spiders. They also feed on the [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will hover to catch flying insects. Although the similarly sized Firecrest and Goldcrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that reduce direct competition for food. Common Firecrests prefer larger prey than Goldcrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, Firecrests will also eat the large [[orb-weaver spider|orb-web spider]]s (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).<ref name = hbw/>

The Common Firecrest feeds in trees, exploiting mainly the upper surface of branches in [[pinophyta|conifer]]ous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. This is in contrast to the Goldcrest, which frequently feeds on the undersides of branches and leaves. In winter, flocks of Common Firecrests cover a given distance about three times faster than do Goldcrests, and ignore the smallest prey items preferred by their relative; large invertebrates are killed by beating them repeatedly against a branch.<ref name = hbw/> The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; Firecrests have broader bills with longer [[feather|rictal bristle]]s (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The Firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while standing, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the Goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has a deep grooves in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while Firecrests have a smoother underside to the foot.<ref name= Leisler >{{cite journal | last= Leisler | first= Bernd | coauthors= Thaler, Ellen | year=1982 | title= Differences in morphology and foraging behaviour in the goldcrest ''Regulus regulus'' and firecrest ''R. ignicapillus'' | journal= Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume= 19 | pages= 277<U+2013>284 | url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf19/anz19-277-284.pdf |format = PDF }}</ref>

Young Common Firecrests are fed almost exclusively with springtails; larger food items are not accepted, and spiders are occasionally regurgitated. From the fifth day onwards, the nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells, the latter being needed for bone growth. After the second week, the food includes larger moths and caterpillars, as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults, such as [[Opiliones|harvestmen]], [[earwig]]s, and [[centipede]]s.<ref name="hbw"/>

In winter, the Firecrest joins loose flocks of other wanderers such as [[tit (bird)|tits]] and warblers.<ref name= Baker/> This kinglet, like other species that prefer [[mixed-species foraging flock]]s in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds.<ref name= Herrera>{{cite journal || last= Herrera | first= Carlos M | year= 1979 | title= Ecological aspects of heterospecific flocks formation in a Mediterranean passerine bird community | journal= Oikos | volume=33 | issue = 1 | pages= 85<U+2013>96 | url = http://www.plant-animal.es/pdfs/Herrera.1979.Oikos.pdf |format = PDF }}</ref> In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables for fatty food, sometimes with Goldcrests or warblers such as the [[Chiffchaff|Common Chiffchaff]] and [[Blackcap]].<ref name= Simms/> The kinglet's digestive system is adapted to an entirely insectivorous diet, whereas ''[[typical warbler|Sylvia]]'' warblers include fruit in their autumn diet. A Spanish study compared that genus with the insectivorous Firecrest and ''[[Leaf-warbler|Phylloscopus]]'' warblers. The results showed that, relative to body weight, the insect-eaters had shorter intestines, but longer gut passage times than the ''Sylvia'' species. The insect-eaters are also generally slightly smaller than the [[omnivore]]s.<ref name= Jordano >{{cite journal || last= Jordano | first= Pedro | year= 1987 | title= Frugivory, external morphology and digestive system in Mediterranean sylviid warblers ''Sylvia'' spp. | journal= Ibis | volume=129 | pages= 175<U+2013>189 | url = http://ebd10.ebd.csic.es/pdfs/Jordano_1987_Ibis_Sylvia%20morphology%20and%20frugivory.pdf |format = PDF }}</ref>

[[File:Accipiter nisus Meneer Zjeroen.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Eurasian Sparrowhawk]] is a major predator of small songbirds.]]

The invasive [[Argentine Ant]] (''Linepithema humile'') is common in the Mediterranean area, and reduces [[arthropod]] numbers by removing most native ant species. The reduction in prey items is greatest in the tree canopy, and has a greater effect on species like the Firecrest that feed high in the foliage. Less food is available for chicks, and parents have to spend more time foraging.<ref name= Argentine >{{cite journal || last= Estany-Tigerstr<U+00F6>m | first= David | coauthors= Bas, Josep Maria;  Pons, Pere | year=2010 | title= Does Argentine ant invasion affect prey availability for foliage-gleaning birds?  | journal= Biological Invasions | volume= 12 | pages= 827<U+2013>839 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/r10315356g7841m5/fulltext.pdf |format = PDF | doi = 10.1007/s10530-009-9504-6}}</ref>

== In culture ==

[[Aristotle]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird which had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title.<ref>Aristotle, ''[[History of Animals]]'', 9.11.</ref><ref>Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 10.74</ref> Following from this legend, in much European folklore the [[Eurasian Wren|Wren]] has been described as the "king of the birds" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the ''Regulus'' species, the fiery crowns of the Goldcrest and Firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles,<ref name= zeus>{{cite book || last = Cook | first = Arthur Bernard | coauthors= | title = Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion | year = 1914 | publisher =Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page = 52, footnote 4}}</ref> and, because of the legend's reference to the "smallest of birds" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny Wren.<ref name = Suolahti>{{cite book || last = Suolahti | first = Viktor Hugo | title = Die deutschen Vogelnamen : eine wortgeschichtliche Untersuchung | year = 1909 | publisher = Karl J Trbner| language = German | location = Strassbourg | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/diedeutschenvoge00suol#page/80/mode/2up | pages =80<U+2013>85 }}</ref><ref name= Cocker>{{cite book | last = Cocker | first = Mark | coauthors= Mabey, Richard | title= Birds Britannica |year=2005 |location = London | page =232 | publisher = Chatto & Windus | isbn = 0701169079}}</ref> The confusion was assisted by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the [[Ancient Greek]] words for the Wren (<U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2> ''basileus'', "king") and the crests (<U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2> ''basiliskos'', "kinglet").<ref name= arnott>{{cite book || last = Arnott | first =William Geoffrey  | title = Birds in the ancient world from A to Z | year = 2007  | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 041523851X |page = 35 |}}</ref> In English, the association between the Firecrest and Eurasian Wren was reinforced by the kinglet's old name of "Fire-crested Wren".<ref name= Doubleday>{{cite book || last = Doubleday | first = Henry | location = London | title = A Nomenclature of British Birds | year = 1865 | publisher = John van Voorst | edition = 4 |page = 10 |url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=Fu0DAAAAQAAJ&ots=GmWS9MdqIK&dq=A%20nomenclature%20of%20British%20birds&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>
