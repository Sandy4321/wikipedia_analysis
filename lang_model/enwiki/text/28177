The '''1956 BOAC Argonaut accident''' occurred on 24 June 1956 when a [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC)  four-engined [[Canadair North Star|Canadair C-4 Argonaut]] airliner [[Aircraft registration|registered]] ''G-ALHE'' crashed into a tree on departure from [[Kano Airport]] in [[Nigeria]], three crew and 29 passengers were killed.<ref name="CAA" /><ref name="Times53830" />

==Accident==
At 17:21 the Argonaut departed Runway 25 at Kano Airport on the way to Tripoli in Libya.<ref name="CAA" /> The flight was from Lagos to London and had made a scheduled stop at Kano.<ref name="CAA" /><ref name="Times53830" /> It was raining as the aircraft reached 250 feet when the aircraft began to lose height.<ref name="CAA" /> The pilot applied full power but the aircraft continued to descend until it hit a tree about 1<U+00BD> miles from the end of the runway.<ref name="CAA" /> Three of the seven crew members and 29 of the 38 passengers were killed in the crash, two crew and two passengers were seriously injured.<ref name="CAA" /> 

==Investigation==
A team from the British Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and BOAC flew out from London on the 25 June in a chartered [[Canadair North Star|Canadair Argonaut]] to help in the investigation.<ref name="Times53567" /> The Nigerian investigation team of four was led by the Director of Civil Aviation.<ref name="Times53567" />

==Inquiry Report==
The Board of Inquiry concluded "The accident was the result of a loss of height and airspeed caused by the aircraft encountering, at approximately 250ft after take-off, an unpredictable thunderstorm cell which gave rise to a sudden reversal of wind direction, heavy rain, and possible downdraft conditions. The formation of the cell could not have been predicted by the meteorological forecaster at Kano airport, nor was it visible to the pilot in command before taking off. In the circumstances, no blame can be attached to the pilot in command for taking off."<ref name="Times53598" /> 

The report also recommended that the [[International Civil Aviation Organisation]] urgently consider investigating the special hazards to aircraft inherent in taking off or landing in close proximity to thunderstorms.<ref name="Times53598" />

The Kano accident was one of the first to a large airliner to be attributed directly to the weather phenomenon later to be more widely known by the term "[[microburst]]", and the subsequent analysis of the tragedy contributed importantly to a better understanding of a grave and hitherto under-appreciated danger to aviation.
