==History==

A formal agreement to build a station at Harringay was made between the [[British Land Company]] and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] in April 1884.<ref name=Kay>Peter Kay, ''The Great Northern Main Line in London - Harringay Station'', The London Railway Record, Issue 56, July 2008, North London Railway Historical Society, Connor & Butler</ref> The Land Company needed the station to serve housing it was building to the east of the railway line on the site of [[History of Harringay (1880<U+2013>present)#1880 to 1940|Harringay House]], so it contributed <U+00A3>3,500 to the cost and agreed to bear the working costs of the station for an initial period. Contracts to build  the station (including the footbridge) and a road bridge over the [[Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway|Tottenham & Hampstead]] line went to S.W. Pattinson of Ruskington for <U+00A3>8,000 and <U+00A3>3,999 respectively in August the same year.<ref name=fcc/>

The station was constructed with an up platform as an island serving the ''up main'' and ''up slow'', and a single-sided down platform serving the ''down slow'' only. A 300ft long footbridge was constructed to give access to the station. It stretched from a station approach road off Wightman Road to the west side of the cutting, where Quernmore Road would eventually be built some fifteen years later. A booking office was built on the footbridge above the platforms.<ref name=Kay/>

The station opened to passenger traffic on 1 May 1885 with a staff complement of a station master, two assistant clerks, two ticket collectors, and three porters. Although it had been agreed that the station would be named ''Harringay Park'', the GNR public timetable from May 1885 shows that station was in fact named ''Harringay'' from the outset.  A goods yard was built to the east of the line, but the exact date it opened for public traffic is not recorded.<ref name=Kay/>

In 1900 when the a second ''down slow'' passenger line was added and the down platform was made an island and widened throughout.<ref name=Kay/>

The 1885 Booking Office building suffered fire damage in the 1960s and had been almost entirely removed by 1969.<ref name=fcc/> It was replaced by a small timber shack which still serves as a ticket office today.

The station was renamed "Harringay West" on 18 June 1951, but reverted to "Harringay" on 27 May 1971.<ref name=Kay/>

In 1975 the platform layout was altered with the west sides of both acting as single sided platforms.<ref name=fcc/> A replacement waiting room/canopy block was provided on each. <ref name=fcc/>

Since 1976 only the central part of the footbridge, and the girders built to carry the old booking office building, remain from the 1885 station structure.

Under plans approved in 1897, the station was to be served by the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway|Great Northern and Strand Railway]] (GN&SR), a tube railway supported by the GNR which would have run underground beneath the GNR's tracks from [[Alexandra Palace railway station|Alexandra Palace]] to Finsbury Park and then into central London. The GN&SR stations on each side would have been the same as the main line stations. The GN&SR route and stations north of Finsbury Park were cancelled in 1902 when the GN&SR was taken over by [[Charles Yerkes|Charles Yerkes']] consortium which planned to merge it with the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway to form the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway from Finsbury Park to [[Hammersmith]] (now part of the [[London Underground|London Underground's]] [[Piccadilly line]]).<ref name=Lost>{{cite book |last=Badsey-Ellis |first=Antony |title=London's Lost Tube Schemes |origyear=2005 |publisher=Capital Transport |pages=77 and 138 |isbn=185414-293-3 }}</ref>

==Infrastructure ==

Trains calling at this station use the low-speed rail tracks in front of the platforms; there are five more tracks passing through and around the vicinity of the station. Two of these are used for high-speed [[National Express East Coast]], [[Hull Trains]] and other First Capital Connect services and the other three are used for freight services. Occasionally when these lines are busy the low-speed tracks are used for the faster services.<ref>Joe Brown (2006). London Railway Atlas. Ian Allan Publishing.</ref>

These trains use dual-voltage [[British Rail Class 317|class 313 EMUs]] because these are the only units cleared to run to Moorgate (however, some weekend services may use class 317s as these run to Kings Cross).<ref>[http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?iCmsPageId=233&sMethod=ViewArchive&iForumId=15&sQuestionNumber=&sAskedby=&sSearchFor=&iSectionId=5 ''Meet the Directors'', First Capital Connect website]</ref>

Harringay has a ticket office on the footbridge connecting it to Wightman and Quernmore roads.<ref name=fcc/> Its opening hours are:

*Monday - Friday: 06:05 - 14:35
*Saturday: 07:05 - 15:35 
*Sundays: closed.<ref name=fcc/>

In Autumn 2008, a new SHERE self-service ticket machine, accepting both cash and credit cards, was installed here and at other local FCC stations.<ref name=fcc/>

The station has four electronic timetables, one per platform, one inside the ticket office and one outside the ticket office(for when it is closed), this station is also fitted with a hearing loop.

There is a basic waiting room and sheltered area on each platform with some bench seating. 
The station has cycle access but no wheelchair access.<ref name=NREW/>

A payphone is situated just outside the station on Quernmore Road and shops both here and just beyond the Wightman Road exit.
