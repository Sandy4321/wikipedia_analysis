"'''Dirrty'''" is a song performed by American singer [[Christina Aguilera]] featuring rapper Reggie "[[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]" Noble.  The song was written by Aguilera and Redman along with [[Jasper Cameron]], Balewa Muhammad, and [[Rockwilder]] for Aguilera's second studio album ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' (2002).  It received mixed reviews from music critics.

"Dirrty" was released in September 2002 as the album's [[lead single]] (see [[2002 in music]]). It was unsuccessful in the U.S., only reaching number 48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], but was better received elsewhere, cracking the Top 10 of 17 countries and topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the [[Irish Singles Chart]]. "Dirrty" was nominated for "[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]" at the [[45th Grammy Awards]].

The song is best remembered for its accompanying [[music video]], for which Aguilera was allowed creative control.  The video brought her sexuality to the forefront and depicted various [[sexual fetishes]], from [[mud wrestling]] to [[sthenolagnia]].  It eliminated the [[teenybopper]], "[[girl next door]]" image that she had accumulated from her previous work.

Aguilera had worked with [[hip hop producer]] Rockwilder during the recording of "[[Lady Marmalade]]" (2001).  Late in the making of ''Stripped'', Aguilera approached him again, wanting him to help produce a seriously "down and dirty" song to announce her comeback and new public image.  Aguilera suggested using Redman's "[[Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)]]" (2001) as a guide, and the resulting "Dirrty" was a remake of its precursor.<ref>Hiatt, Brian.  [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,385297,00.html "'Dirrty' Work"].  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.  October 29, 2002. Retrieved June 16, 2007.</ref> She later included a sequel titled "Still Dirrty" on her 2006 album ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]''.

"Dirrty" is a hip pop song composed in the key of [[G minor]].

Retrieved June 16, 2007.</ref>  Aguilera decided to use a misspelling for the title as a way to personalize the song, also considering "Dirtee" or "Dirrdy".  She decided on "Dirrty" as a reflection of the music video, commenting, "I felt like having two r's, kind of like grrr<U+2026>Gritty<U+2026>underground, illegal stuff going on."<ref>Moss, Corey.

==Critical reception==
"Dirrty" received mixed reviews from music critics.  [[Allmusic]] referred to it as a "non-song" and found that Aguilera's [[vocal range]] in the song was too narrow.<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]].

[[Linda Perry]], who had worked with Aguilera on "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]", stated that she and Aguilera's management had recommended it as the lead single from ''Stripped'' but that Aguilera insisted on "Dirrty" instead.  [[RCA Records]], however, stated that it had agreed with Aguilera to release "Dirrty" to attract attention to Aguilera and the album.<ref>Hiatt, Brian.

The song's music video was directed by [[David LaChapelle]].  It depicts what was described as "a post-apocalyptic orgy".<ref name="blender">Duerden, Nick.

Wearing a [[bikini]] and [[chaps]], she is lowered from a cage into a [[boxing ring]] and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers.  A masked woman is lowered into the ring, and the two engage in [[foxy boxing]].
