'''''Bala Mitrula Katha''''' is a 1972 [[Telugu language|Telugu]] movie directed by [[K. Varaprasada Rao]], starring [[Jaggayya]], [[Krishnam Raju]], [[Gummadi Venkateswara Rao|Gummadi]] and [[Nagabhushanam]]. It is a story of friendship of two kids of different social status and the support of their teacher amid the political and village backdrop.

==Plot==
Satyam and Dharmaiah are friends and favorite students of Bhavani Prasad. Satyam is the son of Bhushaiah, a rich landlord. Dharmaiah is the son of Kotaiah, a laborer. The story starts with Bhavani Prasad teaching his students about the need for unity among people of all castes and creeds and the song "Gunna Mamidi Komma Meedha" that epitomizes his teachings and friendship.

Nagaraju, an unruly kid, is the son of Papaiah, village president. Animosity between land lord politicians Papaiah and Bhushaiah is reflected in the lives of their children. Nagaraju challenges Satyam about their ability to buy tickets for a circus show. Satyam unsuccessfully tries to get money from his parents, Bhushaiah and Santhamma. As part of the plan to extract money, Dharmaiah lies that Satyam committed suicide. Santhamma dies of shock and Satyam and Dharmaiah decide to never lie again. The rest of the story is about how they stand with truth despite the hardships they face.

Teacher Prasad files a case against Papaiah about mixing salt in ammonia fertilizer. His student Dharmaiah gives evidence before the collector and causes President Papaiah to lose reputation and his father Kotaiah to lose his job. Dharmaiah escapes from the house and hides in Bhushaiah's farm house to avoid the ire of his father. Kotaiah searches for his son and reaches the farm house. Bhushaiah's group catches Kotaiah and misunderstands that Papaiah sent him to steal his rival's herd. Satyam comes to rescue and gives evidence before the collector to save Kotaiah. None of the village elders, Papaiah, Bhushaiah and Kotaiah, can understand the intensity of the friendship between Dharmaiah and Satyam and their commitment to truth. Satyam and Dharma escape from village and face several problems in the city. Prasad comes to know that militant revolutionaries led by his childhood friend are going to kill Papaiah and tells Satyam and Dharma to inform Papaiah. Militants, villagers and police face a triangular fight and the rebel leader is  killed. The movie ends with village elders Bhashaih, Papaiah and Kotaiah recognizing the need for honest people like Dharma and Satyam in village.
