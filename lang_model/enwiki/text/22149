It is represented by the [[chemical symbol|symbol]] '''H'''. At [[standard temperature and pressure]], hydrogen is a [[Transparency (optics)|colorless]], [[odorless]], [[nonmetal]]lic, [[tasteless]], highly [[combustion|flammable]] [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] [[gas]] with the [[molecular formula]] H<sub>2</sub>. With an [[atomic weight]] of 1.00794, hydrogen is the lightest element.

Hydrogen is the most [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] chemical element, constituting roughly 75% of the universe's elemental mass.<ref>{{cite web | last=Palmer | first=David | date=1997-09-13 | url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/971113i.html | title=Hydrogen in the Universe | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2008-02-05 }}</ref> [[Star]]s in the [[main sequence]] are mainly composed of hydrogen in its [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state.

The most common [[isotope]] of hydrogen is [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (name rarely used) with a single [[proton]] and no [[neutron]]s. In [[ionic compound]]s it can take a negative charge (an [[Ion|anion]] known as a [[hydride]] and written as H<sup>-</sup>), or as a positively-charged species H<sup>+</sup>. The latter [[Ion|cation]] is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species. Hydrogen forms compounds with most elements and is present in [[water]] and most [[organic compound]]s. It plays a particularly important role in [[acid-base reaction theories|acid-base chemistry]] with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the [[Schr<U+00F6>dinger equation]], the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

[[Image:hydrogen atom.svg|thumb|right|Depiction of a hydrogen atom showing the diameter as about twice the [[Bohr model]] radius (image not to scale).]]

The [[ground state]] [[energy level]] of the electron in a hydrogen atom is <U+2212>13.6&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]], which is equivalent to an ultraviolet [[photon]] of roughly 92&nbsp;[[metre|nm]].<ref>{{cite web

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the sun. However, the [[electromagnetic force]] attracts electrons and protons to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by [[gravity]]. Because of the discretization of [[angular momentum]] postulated in early [[quantum mechanics]] by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.<ref>{{cite web

===Covalent and organic compounds===
While H<sub>2</sub> is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Millions of [[hydrocarbon]]s are known, but they are not formed by the direct reaction of elementary hydrogen and carbon (although [[synthesis gas]] production followed by the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to make hydrocarbons comes close to being an exception, as this begins with coal and the elemental hydrogen is generated in situ).{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more [[electronegative]], such as [[halogen]]s (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I); in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge.<ref>{{cite web

However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and since it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry.<ref name="hydrocarbon"/>

In [[inorganic chemistry]], hydrides can also serve as [[bridging ligand]]s that link two metal centers in a [[coordination complex]]. This function is particularly common in [[group 13 element]]s, especially in [[borane]]s ([[boron]] hydrides) and [[aluminium]] complexes, as well as in clustered [[carborane]]s.<ref name="Miessler" />

===Hydrides===
Compounds of hydrogen are often called [[hydride]]s, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" implies that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H<sup><U+2212></sup>, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more [[electropositive]] element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1916 for group I and II salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 with the electrolysis of molten [[lithium hydride]] (LiH), that produced a [[stoichiometric]] quantity of hydrogen at the anode.<ref name="Moers">{{cite journal

}}</ref> For hydrides other than group I and II metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group II hydrides is BeH<sub>2</sub>, which is polymeric. In [[lithium aluminium hydride]], the AlH<sub>4</sub><sup><U+2212></sup> anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III). Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, there are over 100 binary borane hydrides known, but only one binary aluminium hydride.<ref name="Downs">{{cite journal

===Protons and acids===
{{see|Acid-base reaction}}
Oxidation of hydrogen, in the sense of removing its electron, formally gives H<sup>+</sup>, containing no electrons and a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] which is usually composed of one [[proton]]. That is why H<sup>+</sup> is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of [[acid]]s. Under the [[Bronsted-Lowry theory]], acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton H<sup>+</sup> cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals, because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures assocated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the [[electron cloud]]s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or [[cation]]ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "H<sup>+</sup>" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "[[hydronium]] ion" (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are thought more realistically physically to be organized into clusters that form species closer to H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>.<ref name="Okumura">{{cite journal

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the [[atom]]ic and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] they interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[Aurora (phenomenon)|aurora]]. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the [[Interstellar medium]]. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the [[Universe]] up to [[redshift]] ''z''=4.<ref>{{cite journal

Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H<sub>2</sub> (for data see table). However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 [[part per million|ppm]] by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to [[atmospheric escape|escape from Earth's gravity]] more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen (in chemically combined form) is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface.<ref name="ArgonneBasic">{{cite web

===Discovery and use===
{{main|Timeline of hydrogen technologies}}
Hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub>, was first artificially produced and formally described by T.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical theory]] arrived. Maxwell observed that the [[specific heat capacity]] of H<sub>2</sub> unaccountably departs from that of a [[diatomic]] gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H<sub>2</sub> because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.<ref name="Berman">{{cite journal

==Production==
{{seedetails|Hydrogen production}}
H<sub>2</sub> is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the [[hydrogenation]] of [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling [[redox|reducing]] equivalents in biochemical reactions.

===Laboratory===
In the [[laboratory]], H<sub>2</sub> is usually prepared by the reaction of acids on metals such as [[zinc]] with [[Kipp's apparatus]].
:[[zinc|Zn]] + 2 H<sup>+</sup> <U+2192> Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

[[Aluminium]] can also produce H<sub>2</sub> upon treatment with bases:
::2 Al + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 OH<sup>-</sup><U+2192> 2 Al(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

The [[electrolysis of water]] is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the [[anode]] while gaseous hydrogen forms at the [[cathode]]. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is between 80<U+2013>94%.<ref>{{cite web

In 2007, it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and [[gallium]] in pellet form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen. The process also creates [[alumina]], but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, since hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.<ref>{{cite web| last=Venere | first=Emil | date=May 15, 2007| url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007a/070515WoodallHydrogen.html| title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells| publisher=Purdue University | accessdate=2008-02-05 }}</ref>

===Industrial===
{{main|Hydrogen production}}
Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways, but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]].<ref name="Oxtoby">{{cite book
 | first=D. W. | last=Oxtoby | year=2002
 | title=Principles of Modern Chemistry
 | edition=5th edition | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole
 | isbn=0030353734 }}</ref> At high temperatures (700<U+2013>1100&nbsp;<U+00B0>C; 1,300<U+2013>2,000&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield [[carbon monoxide]] and H<sub>2</sub>.
:[[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]] + [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] <U+2192> [[carbon monoxide|CO]] + 3 H<sub>2</sub>

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (20&nbsp;atm; 600&nbsp;[[inHg]]) since high pressure H<sub>2</sub> is the most marketable product. The product mixture is known as "[[synthesis gas]]" because it is often used directly for the production of [[methanol]] and related compounds. [[Hydrocarbon]]s other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:
: [[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]] <U+2192> C + 2 H<sub>2</sub>

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of H<sub>2</sub>O. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the [[water gas shift reaction]], especially with an [[iron oxide]] catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of [[carbon dioxide]]:<ref name="Oxtoby" />
: CO + H<sub>2</sub>O <U+2192> [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>

Other important methods for H<sub>2</sub> production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:<ref>{{cite web| title = Hydrogen Properties, Uses, Applications| publisher = Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.| year = 2007| url = http://www.uigi.com/hydrogen.html| accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref>
: 2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> 2 CO + 4 H<sub>2</sub>

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:<ref name="Oxtoby" />
: C + H<sub>2</sub>O <U+2192> CO + H<sub>2</sub>

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the [[Haber process]] for the [[Ammonia production|production of ammonia]], hydrogen is generated from natural gas.<ref>{{cite web| last = Funderburg| first = Eddie| title = Why Are Nitrogen Prices So High?| publisher = The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation | year = 2008| url = http://www.noble.org/Ag/Soils/NitrogenPrices/Index.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref> [[Electrolysis]] of [[brine]] to yield [[chlorine]] also produces hydrogen as a co-product.<ref>{{cite web| last = Lees| first = Andrew| title = Chemicals from salt| publisher = BBC | year = 2007| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/chemistry/usefulproductsrocks/chemicals_saltrev3.shtml| accessdate = 2008-03-11}}</ref>

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for [[water splitting]], around a dozen of these cycles such as the [[iron oxide cycle]], [[cerium(IV) oxide-cerium(III) oxide cycle]], [[zinc zinc-oxide cycle]], [[sulfur-iodine cycle]], [[copper-chlorine cycle]] and [[hybrid sulfur cycle]] are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf|title=Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water|format=PDF}}</ref> A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress07/ii_f_1_perret.pdf | title = Development of Solar-Powered Thermochemical Production of Hydrogen from Water, DOE Hydrogen Program, 2007 | author = Robert Perret | accessdate = 2008-05-17 |format=PDF}}</ref>

==Applications==
Large quantities of H<sub>2</sub> are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of H<sub>2</sub> is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the production of [[ammonia]]. The key consumers of H<sub>2</sub> in the petrochemical plant include [[hydrodealkylation]], [[hydrodesulfurization]], and [[cracking (chemistry)#Hydrocracking|hydrocracking]]. H<sub>2</sub> has several other important uses. H<sub>2</sub> is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and [[Vegetable oil|oils]] (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of [[methanol]]. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of [[hydrochloric acid]]. H<sub>2</sub> is also used as a [[reducing agent]] of metallic [[ore]]s.<ref>{{cite web

==Biological reactions==
{{see|Biohydrogen|Biological hydrogen production}}
H<sub>2</sub> is a product of some types of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]] and is produced by several [[microorganism]]s, usually via reactions [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[iron]]- or [[nickel]]-containing [[enzyme]]s called [[hydrogenase]]s. These enzymes catalyze the reversible [[redox]] reaction between H<sub>2</sub> and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during [[pyruvate]] [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to water.<ref>{{cite book

[[Water splitting]], in which water is decomposed into its component protons, electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the [[light reaction]]s in all [[photosynthetic]] organisms. Some such organisms<U+2014>including the alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'' and [[cyanobacteria]]<U+2014>have evolved a second step in the [[dark reaction]]s in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H<sub>2</sub> gas by specialized hydrogenases in the [[chloroplast]].<ref>{{cite journal

Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|parahydrogen/orthohydrogen]] ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.<ref name=NASAH2/>
