This article delineates the [[infrastructure]] comprising the [[Singapore Changi Airport]], the main airport in [[Singapore]],  and a major aviation hub in Southeast Asia. The airport is located approximately {{convert|17.2|km|abbr=on}} northeast<ref name="AIP">[http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-1.pdf Aerodrome Geographical and Administrative Data, Services and Facilities] and [http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD_2-11.pdf Meteorological Information and Runway Physical Characteristics]</ref> from the commercial centre in [[Changi]], on a {{convert|13|km2|sqmi}} site.

==Background==
Given limited land resources in Singapore, [[Singapore Changi Airport]] was designed for both current and future needs as the country's primary airport. The airport was designed to be capable of doubling in size using reclaimed land with enough space for two more runways and at least two new passenger terminal buildings.

The master plan for the existing airport initially involved a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals in the near future. Phase 1 included the construction for the first passenger terminal, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} control tower,.<ref name="Facts & Statistics">{{cite web| title= Changi Airport <U+2013> Facts & Statistics| publisher= Singapore Changi Airport| url= http://www.changiairportgroup.com/export/sites/caas/assets/media_release_2012/21_Mar_2012.pdf}}</ref> Construction for the second phase would commence immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 additional aircraft parking bays, a second fire station and a third cargo agents' building.

==Air traffic control tower==
[[File:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Singapore Changi Airport - Air Traffic Control Tower]]
The Air traffic control tower (ATC) was constructed as part of Phase One of the Changi Airport redevelopment plan. The iconic tower is situated between Changi International Airport 2 runways and stands at about 81 m Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). It provides aerodrome control service to aircraft landing and departing Changi Airport and aircraft maneuvering within the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html |title= Singapore Changi Control Tower | publisher= Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS)}}</ref>

==Runways==
Changi Airport has two parallel runways, 02L/20R and 02C/20C, each {{convert|4000|by|60|m|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="AIP"/> 02L/20R was completed and opened in 1981 as part of the airport's first phase. It has a [[displaced threshold]] of {{convert|740|m|abbr=on|0}} leaving the rest of the runway at {{convert|3260|m|abbr=on|0}} long.<ref name="AIP"/> 02C/20C, formerly 02R/20L, was built completely on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] and opened with phase&nbsp;2, {{convert|1.6|km|abbr=on}} apart from 02L/20R. Four [[instrument landing system]]s (ILS) are installed on the two runways to guide [[landing]] aircraft safely under all weather conditions. Both runways are also used by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] as part of [[Changi Airbase (West)|Changi Airbase]].

A new parallel runway 02R/20L (named 01/19 when opened in 2004) was built {{convert|1.8|km|abbr=on}} to the east of 02C/20C, currently used only by [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] aircraft as part of Changi Airbase (East). The existing Runway 3, currently used by the military, will be extended from 2.75&nbsp;km to 4&nbsp;km to handle larger passenger aircraft. Almost 40&nbsp;km of new taxiways will also be built to connect the runway with the current airport. New facilities such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will need to be built as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/budget-2013-third-runway-changi-airport-2020-20130313 | title=Budget 2013: Third runway for Changi Airport by 2020 | publisher=The Straits Times | date=13 March 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>

==Airport Hotel==
[[File:Crowne Plaza Changi Airport, Singapore - 20120320.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport]]
Voted as one of the "World's Top 10 Airport Hotels" at the 2011 World Airport Awards, the Crowne Plaza Hotel is linked to Changi Airport's Terminal 3 via a covered link bridge, with Terminals 1 and 2 reachable by Skytrain which located within the immediate vicinity of Changi Airport. lt is 9-storey high and has 320 guest rooms.<ref>[http://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/singapore/sincp/hoteldetail Crowne Plaza Changi Airport - Singapore]</ref>Separate transit hotels for transit passengers are available at all 3 terminals, without having to clear immigration.



==Airbus A380 operations==
[[File:Singapore Airlines A380-800(9V-SKD) (4693344489).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Singapore Airlines A380-800 (9V-SKD)]]
[[File:Qantas and Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 at Changi Airport Prasertwit.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Qantas & Singapore Airlines A380]]
With Changi-based Singapore Airlines being the launch customer for the Airbus A380, works to ensure full capability in handling the large aircraft were given priority in time for its introduction in October 2007. The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] spent [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate holdrooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{convert|70|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}}. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater for the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | title=First Gate at Singapore Changi Airport is Ready for Airbus 380 | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>

==Jewel Changi Airport==
[[File:Project Jewel.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of 'Jewel Changi Airport', the new mixed-used complex set to be set to be constructed on the carpark site fronting Changi Airport's Terminal 1. The complex is being designed to be architecturally iconic, with a stunning glass and steel facade. (Photo: Changi Airport Group).]]
Announced in August 2013, this is a new terminal structure intended as a mix-use complex.<ref name="Jewel">{{cite web | url=http://www.changiairport.com/our-business/media#/pressrelease/view/changi-airport-group-to-develop-iconic-mixed-use-complex-895406?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=Subscription&utm_content=pressrelease | title=Changi Airport Group to develop iconic mixed-use complex | publisher=Changi Airport Group | date=19 August 2013| accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> It will be situated on a 3.5-hectare site where the Terminal 1 car park now resides. Project Jewel is a joint venture between Changi Airport (51%) and [[Capitaland|CapitaMalls Asia]] (49%). Essentially, a new multi-storey underground car park of about 2,500 car park spaces will replace the existing facilities, while an indoor garden (with a waterfall) will be built above. The new building will sit between the three existing terminal buildings, enabling passengers to transfer via the new complex, whilst being an attraction and shopping destination in itself. The design will consist of a circular structure, reminiscent of a doughnut, with a large garden located at the centre and water falling from the edge of the circular atrium opening. There would also be a hotel of about 130 rooms as part of the project.<ref name="Project Jewel"/>

As part of the project, Terminal 1 will be expanded to allow more space for the arrival hall, baggage claim areas and taxi bays. These enhancements will increase T1's passenger handling capacity to 24 million passenger movements per annum by 2018.<ref>{{cite web | title = Singapore Changi Airport breaks new ground with Jewel | url = http://www.jewelchangiairport.com/assets/doc/press-releases/singapore_changi_airport_breaks_new_ground_with_jewel.pdf| date = 5 December 2014}}</ref>

==Passenger terminals==
Changi Airport currently has three terminals, T1, T2, and T3, with a total annual handling capacity of 66&nbsp;million. Terminals&nbsp;1, 2, and 3 are directly connected via a monorail people mover system, with airside passengers being able to freely move between the terminals without going through immigration. Transport within and between these three terminals is also provided by [[people mover]]s and the [[Singapore Changi Airport#Inter-terminal transportation|skytrain system]], although it is also possible to walk between the terminals on foot for landside visitors.

A former Budget Terminal, capable of handling 7&nbsp;million passenger per year, was purpose-built for [[low-cost carrier]]s. It was physically separated from the main terminals towards the south, where connections were possible via a free [[Public transport bus service|shuttle bus]] service to and from Terminal&nbsp;2. Demolition began in 2013 to make way for a new and bigger Terminal&nbsp;4.<ref name="demolition">{{cite news|title=Demolition starts on Budget Terminal|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1251688/1/.html|accessdate=1 February 2013|date=1 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/demolition-work-budget-terminal-begins-make-way-t4-20130201#2 | title=Demolition work for Budget Terminal begins to make way for T4 | publisher=The Straits Times | date=1 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Terminal 1 ===
[[File:Singapore airport pool.jpg|thumb|left|Swimming pool in the transit area of Terminal 1]]
Singapore Changi Airport's oldest terminal operated as the sole terminal from its opening on 1 July 1981 right up until the opening of Terminal 2 nine years later. Configured in a H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges which may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two finger piers to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000<ref>http://www.changiairportgroup.com/export/sites/caas/assets/media_release_2012/12_July_2012.pdf</ref> m<U+00B2> and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.

On 7 March 2012, Minister of State for Transport [[Josephine Teo]] said that the open-air car park between Terminal&nbsp;1 and Changi's iconic control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will increase Terminal&nbsp;1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park spaces. With this expansion, Terminal&nbsp;1's handling capacity will increase from 21 to 24&nbsp;million passengers per annum. The expansion of Terminal&nbsp;1 will go together with Terminal&nbsp;4.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1187569/1/.html Steering committee set up to chart Changi Airport's future development].

=== Terminal 2 ===
[[File:Changi Airport, Terminal 2, Departure Hall.JPG|thumb|Terminal 2 Departure Hall.]]

Terminal&nbsp;2 opened on 22 November 1990 as part of Phase II in the original airport masterplan. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Deploying a linear configuration parallel to the runways, it is located adjacent to Terminal&nbsp;1 towards the south, and heralded the opening of the original skytrain system linking the two terminals via the landside. All Singapore Airlines and SilkAir flights moved to the new terminal when it opened, along with several Southeast Asian carriers including [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[PAL Express]], and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]]. They were joined by several airlines, some of which are allied to Singapore Airlines, in particular [[Lufthansa]], both fellow [[Star Alliance]] members. [[Air France]] was a former user before moving back to Terminal&nbsp;1. Other former users include [[Air Canada]] and [[Austrian Airlines]], which ceased operations to Changi in October 2006. [[Etihad Airways]] was the latest airline to operate from Terminal&nbsp;2 when it commenced flights in September 2007. [[All Nippon Airways]] moved to Terminal&nbsp;2 from 1 October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ana.co.jp/eng/guides/airports/int/sin/sin_e_hd.html |title=Travel Information: Singapore |publisher=Ana.co.jp |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> Now Singapore Airlines flights departing for Southeast Asia, Indian Subcontinent, the Middle East and Africa use this terminal.

Changi Airport was the second in Asia (after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]) to open a dedicated terminal catering to the budget traveller. The name of the Budget Terminal was decided as a result of a naming contest open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|title= Completion of Singapore's "Budget Terminal"| publisher= Changi airport| url= http://www.changiairportgroup.com/export/sites/caas/assets/media_release_2006/2006_PDF/9_Jan_2006.pdf| accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> However, the terminal is not included in the numbering scheme, even though it is the '''third''' terminal to be opened when it opened on 26 March 2006; and Terminal 3 is actually the fifth terminal to be opened at the airport.

To offer lower [[landing fee]]s, handling fees and [[Airport Improvement Fee|airport taxes]], it cuts back on amenities such as aerobridges, elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal.

In September 2008, expansion works costing $10&nbsp;million began and took seven months to complete. The terminal was then able to handle seven million passengers a year, up from originally 2.7&nbsp;million. There are more boarding gates, check-in counters, shops and dining options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/Travel/News/Story/A1Story20080707-75100.html |title=Cited Mon, 7 Jul 2008 The Straits Times |publisher=Asiaone.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> In addition, air-conditioning has been installed for arriving passengers.

On 2 March 2012, it was announced that the Budget Terminal would be closed on 25 September 2012 and demolished to make way for Terminal 4.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1186306/1/.html | title = New Changi Terminal 4 to replace Budget Terminal | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 1 March 2012| accessdate = 1 October 2012}}</ref> All airlines previously operating from the Budget Terminal moved to Terminal 2, after the last flight departed Budget Terminal at 2&nbsp;am on 25 September. Construction of Terminal 4 began in 2013, and is expected to be completed by 2017. It will have a capacity for 16 million passengers per annum, up from the previous 7 million of the Budget Terminal, and will not have aerobridges. It also promises to have a wider choice of retail and food and beverage offerings compared to the current Budget Terminal.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1186306/1/.html New Changi Terminal 4 to replace Budget Terminal].

On 25 September 2012, Budget Terminal officially closed its doors to the public, with its airlines operations moved to Terminal 2 on the same day.<ref>{{cite web | title = Closure of Budget Terminal | url = http://www.changiairport.com/at-changi/our-terminals/closure-of-budget-terminal | date = 25 September 2012}}</ref>

=== JetQuay CIP Terminal ===
JetQuay CIP Terminal, the airport's '''fourth''' terminal, is a privately run terminal, located next to T2. JetQuay provides private check-in, baggage handling, and immigration clearance services. It is the second luxury airport terminal in world to open after the Lufthansa First Class Terminal in [[Frankfurt Airport]]. However, unlike the Lufthansa First Class Terminal, JetQuay is an elite, dedicated CIP (Commercially Important People) terminal that can be used by any passenger travelling in any class, on any airline, through any of the main terminals (T1, T2, or T3).

=== Terminal 3 ===

[[File:Changi Airport Terminal 3 butterfly garden.JPG|thumb|Butterfly garden, Terminal&nbsp;3]]
[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Shops lined along the transit area in Terminal&nbsp;3]]
Terminal 3, the airport's '''fifth''' terminal, became operational on 9 January 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Changi-T3-opens-for-business-1851956.html |title=Singapore Changi Terminal&nbsp;3 Opens |publisher=Dfnionline.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> increasing the airport's annual passenger capacity by 22&nbsp;million. The test flight out of Terminal 3 was a Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to Perth. The flight departed T3 at 5:30&nbsp;pm local time, landing in Perth International Airport at approximately 11:30&nbsp;pm. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The terminal has 28 [[Jet bridge|aerobridge]] gates, with eight capable of handling the Airbus A380. While the other two terminals use separate waiting areas for different gates, Terminal 3 has common waiting areas for some of the gates.

Like other new airports in the region, it has a structure mainly made of glass, with big transparent spaces inside the terminal. However, unlike these newer airports, it incorporates "natural" features and "warm" tone extensively to balance the sterile feel of glass and steel. For example, the column is given a wood-like cladding and the floor of the terminal is mostly cream/ beige colour. The roof has been designed to allow natural light to enter the building, with 919 [[Window#Skylight|skylights]]. A {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}-high "Green Wall" with hanging creepers and waterfall was incorporated to enhance the tropical feel. The Green Wall, designed by Singapore based Landscape Design firm Tierra Design, also helps to regulate the internal temperature of the terminal with the occasional misting. The interior architecture of Terminal 3 recently won the Honour Award from ASLA,<ref name="ASLA">{{cite web|title = Changi Airport Terminal 3 Interior Landscape, Singapore |publisher = American Society of Landscape Architects|date= 12 May 2009|url = http://www.asla.org/2009awards/043.html}}</ref>

Singapore Airlines operated the first flights into Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008, with flight SQ001 from San Francisco via Hong Kong arriving at 1150 hours to a welcome ceremony by Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Lim Siang Keat Raymond]] and the chairman of CAG, Liew Mun Leong. The first departure flight, SQ318, took off at 1250 hours bound for London-Heathrow. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Since then, its regional and [[Flight length|long-haul flights]] bound for North/South America, Europe, East Asia and Oceania depart from the new terminal while all other flights depart from Terminal 2, becoming the first and only airline to operate from multiple terminals in Changi Airport.

[[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Jet Airways]], [[Qatar Airways]] and [[United Airlines]] also moved operations to the terminal on 1 January 2008,<ref>{{Cite news| title= Four airlines to join SIA at new Terminal 3 when it opens on Jan 9 | publisher= Channel NewsAsia| date= 25 October 2007| url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/307749/1/.html}}</ref><ref>[http://www.changiairportgroup.com/export/sites/caas/assets/media_release_2008/2008_PDF/25_Mar_2008.pdf China Eastern Airlines, Jet Airways, Qatar Airways and United Airlines Ready for Take-Off at Changi Airport Terminal 3].

=== Terminal 4 ===
[[File:Terminal 4.jpg|thumb|left|Changi Airport Terminal 4 presents a new passenger travel experience through its unique terminal design and innovative use of technology is slated to open by 2017.]]
The construction of the new Terminal 4, commenced in November 2013.<ref>http://www.changiairportgroup.com/export/sites/caas/assets/media_release_2013/Media-Release-Changi-Airport-breaks-ground-for-Terminal-4-FINALWEB-.pdf</ref> Under a new concept of Fast And Seamless Travel at Changi (FAST@Changi) it will see options such as self-service check-in, self-bag tagging, automated baggage drop, immigration clearance and departure gates being rolled out extensively in the new building. The new Terminal 4 will be a two-storey, 25-metre-high building with a gross floor area of 195,000 square metres (seven times larger than the previous Budget Terminal). 17 stands will be available for narrow body aircraft, 4 stands for wide body planes. A bridge across Airport Boulevard will be constructed to enable buses and other airside vehicles to move from T4 to distant aircraft stands. There will also be a new dedicated 68-metre-high Ramp Control Tower constructed. While great emphasis has been placed on high technology with in the new terminal space, it will be connected to the Terminal 2 by a conventional Airport Shuttle Bus rather than the automated Skytrain that links the other terminals.

Local cultural and heritage items will be used in decorating the terminal interior. The retail space will feature traditional Peranakan shop front facades. Completion of the terminal is expected in 2017.<ref name="Jewel"/>

Concurrent with the development of Terminal 4, major airfield works will also be undertaken at Changi Airport to increase the number of aircraft parking stands to support the needs of all airlines operating at Changi. A 38-hectare land plot south of Terminal 3, housing the airport nursery as well as a reservoir, will be converted into an aircraft parking area to house 17 narrow-body and nine wide-body aircraft stands. An overhead vehicular bridge across Airport Boulevard will be constructed to enable buses and other airside vehicles to move from T4 to these aircraft stands. Including new aircraft stands to be constructed at the T4 site, the number of parking stands at Changi Airport will be increased by 24% to more than 180. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Cathay Pacific]] is the first airline that will operate at Changi Airport's Terminal 4 when it opens in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/transport/story/cathay-pacific-first-confirm-it-will-move-changi-airport-t4-2017-2014|title=Cathay Pacific first to confirm it will move to Changi Airport T4 in 2017}}</ref>

=== Terminal 5 ===
A fifth terminal, Terminal 5, will be ready in the next decade as announced by [[Ministry of Transport (Singapore)|Transport Minister]], [[Lui Tuck Yew]] on 7 May 2013. Terminal 5 will be built on 1,080 hectares of reclaimed land in Changi East, making it one of the largest terminals in the world. The terminal could handle a capacity of 50 million passengers annually. With the addition of the fifth terminal, Changi Airport will be able to cater to more than 135 million passengers every year. With the national carrier at Terminal 5, each alliance of airlines such as [[SkyTeam]] and [[Oneworld]] could also operate out of dedicated terminals. Terminal 5 is also expected to have more self-service facilities and bigger lounges.<ref name="channelnewsasia1"/><ref name="channelnewsasia2"/> Terminal 5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport. This will allow the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals, maximum passenger convenience and airfield operational efficiency.

In order to create a contiguous and integrated airfield, the existing Changi Coast Road and the park connector beside it will be replaced with a new at-grade road and park connector further east, along the eastern coastline. Works are expected to start in the second half of 2014. The road infrastructure will be improved to ensure convenient access to Terminal 5. The terminal will also be connected to the MRT network. More details will be released after engineering studies are completed. The adequacy of bus services to the airport will also be reviewed. These plans will ensure that all airport users and staff are able to travel to the airport easily and conveniently.<ref>{{cite web | title = Changi developments to open path to new opportunities | url = http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mot/press_release/P-20130830-2/AttachmentPar/0/file/C2036%20Media%20Release%20(media).pdf | date = 6 May 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Changi Airport, Terminal 2, Restricted Area 9.JPG|thumb|Extensive foliage in Terminal 2 provides relaxation for passengers in the transit area.]]
The airport has over {{convert|70000|m2|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} of space spread between its three main terminals for shopping and eating outlets, with Terminal 3 having the largest amount of retail space at {{convert|20000|m2|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Lifestyle/Taste/Story/STIStory_195597.html |title=Strait Times |work=Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>

From two different lounges with 24-hour napping areas, showers and spa facilities, to hotel and pool amenities, this airport also includes Singapore Tours (created for those in transit for more than 5 hours who are granted a special pass to leave the airport on one of two city tour options<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.changiairport.com/at-changi/leisure-indulgences/free-singapore-tour |title=Free Singapore Tour Courtesy Changi Airport}}</ref>), Nature Trail (with six themed garden reserves) and comprehensive dining and entertainment options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiaacer.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/best-layover-airport-list/|title=Changi Airport|accessdate=8 May 2008}}</ref>

In terms of sales, the airport outstrips other shopping malls in Singapore, including those in top tourist spot [[Orchard Road]]. The Changi Airport Group derives 55% of its total annual revenue from non-aeronautical sources,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/1060102/1/.html |title=S$1m cash prize awaits lucky shopper at Changi Airport <U+2013> Channel NewsAsia |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=31 May 2010|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> such as office and warehouse rental. The airport derives the majority of its commercial revenue from the duty-free shopping, with the most popular items being liquor and tobacco, perfume and cosmetics, and luxury goods.

In addition to a wide array of duty-free shops and eating outlets, Changi Airport has five garden areas, some outdoors and some indoors. Open to customers of the airport, the gardens are: Cactus Garden (T1 <U+2013> outdoor), Sunflower Garden (T2 <U+2013> outdoor), Orchid Garden (T2 <U+2013> indoor), Enchanted Garden (T2 <U+2013> indoor), and Butterfly Garden (T3 <U+2013> outdoor). Changi Airport has numerous business centres located around the airport. Within the international transit area of the interconnected Terminals 1,2 and 3,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.changiairport.com/getting-around/getting-around-the-airport/inter-terminal-transfer |title=Inter-Terminal Transfer at Changi}}</ref> internet and games facilities, prayer rooms, showers, spas, gym, swimming pool and a hotel are provided. Various lounge areas are provided, some including children's play areas or televisions showing news, movie and sport channels.

Passengers at Changi Airport will soon be able to board their flights faster, with the introduction of self-boarding gates. The Changi Airport Group (CAG) has been conducting trials of the self-boarding gates at a common gatehold room in Terminal 2 since May with [[Lufthansa]]. The self-boarding gates are just one component of a fast and seamless travel (FAST) initiative which CAG will be rolling out across terminals at the airport. Since April 2014, the gates have been progressively introduced in common gatehold rooms in all three terminals. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The on-going trial of a number of self-service functions <U+2013> check-in, bag tagging and bag drop <U+2013> will run for about three months until August 2014. It will enable CAG to assess improvements and adjustments needed for the hardware and software of the various systems.

Two self bag-drop units and four self check-in kiosks have been fitted alongside the [[Jetstar]] check-in counters in Terminal 1. Passengers on selected [[Jetstar]] flights are invited to use these self-service options. At the self check-in kiosk, passengers print their boarding pass as well as baggage tag after checking in. After tagging their baggage, they can drop it off at the self bag-drop counter. A receipt is provided for checked-in baggage. Instructional videos and signs are available to guide passengers, and on-ground staff are also present to provide assistance. Since the trial started in early-May, about 1,000 passengers have used the FAST facilities. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

====Ground handling====
[[File:Singapore changi airport ground handling emirates.JPG|thumb|An [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] [[Boeing 777-300]] and [[Cathay Pacific]] [[Boeing 747-400]] being serviced at Terminal 1]]

Ground handling services are handled by two companies: [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]] (SATS) and [[Dnata]]. SATS is the dominant player with close to 70% of the market in the airport. [[Dnata Singapore]], formerly Changi International Airport Services (CIAS), was formed in 1977 by the [[PSA International|Port of Singapore Authority]] and five airlines ([[Air France]], [[China Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V.]] (KLM; Royal Dutch Airlines) and [[Lufthansa]]). It handles the remaining market share.

In the early 2000s, the government decided to introduce competition into the market by offering an additional license. [[Swissair]]'s Swissport won the 10-year license and commenced operations on 2 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090415005215/http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archivedate= 15 April 2009| title= Swissport handles its first flight in Singapore <U+2013> four months earlier than planned| accessdate=20 January 2008| date= 2 March 2005| work= News Releases| publisher= Swissport International| quote= 2 March 2005 <U+2013> Swissport commenced its operations at Singapore's Changi Airport today, becoming the airport's third ground handling provider; Swissport's new licence at Changi is valid for ten years and covers passenger, baggage and cargo handling services.}}</ref>

As Swissair folded and was subsequently taken over by [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the latter became the company's first customer. [[Adam Air]] chose Swissport as its ground handler in 2005, while Tiger Airways followed suit in 2006. Other customers of Swissport include [[Swiss World Cargo]], [[AirAsia]], and [[Cardig Air]]. Former customers of Swissport include [[Australian Airlines]]. Swissport ceased operation on 31 March 2009 due to massive losses. Asia Pacific Star was launched on 1 April, is a subsidiary of SATS, and is the new player concentrating mainly on budget carriers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgesingapore.com/the-daily-edge/business/2865-sats-launches-low-cost-ground-handling-unit-asia-pacific-star.pdf |title=SATS launches low-cost ground-handling unit Asia-Pacific Star |publisher=Theedgesingapore.com |date=10 March 2009|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> It handles [[Tiger Airways]], [[South East Asian Airlines]], [[Jetstar Asia]], [[Valuair]], [[Lion Air]].

CIAS underwent restructuring when its shareholding was bought over by [[Dubai]]'s [[Dnata]] in 2004, being relaunched in August 2011 with a new branding.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theemiratesgroup.com/english/our-brands/airport-aviation-handling/dnata-singapore.aspx | title=Our Brands | work=The Emirates Group | accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> Its security services were amalgamated into the new Temasek-owned [[Aetos Security Management]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.temasek.com.sg/mediacentre/newsreleases?detailid=8530 | title=Formation of AETOS Security Management Pte Ltd | publisher=Temasek Holdings | date=31 March 2004| accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref>
