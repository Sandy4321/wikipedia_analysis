The '''Third Battle of Chattanooga''' (popularly known as '''''The'' Battle of Chattanooga''', and including the '''Battle of Lookout Mountain''' and the '''Battle of Missionary Ridge''') was fought from [[November 23]] to [[November 25]] [[1863]], in the [[American Civil War]]. By defeating the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces of General [[Braxton Bragg]], [[Union Army]] [[Major General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] eliminated the last Confederate control of [[Tennessee]] and opened the door to an invasion of the [[Deep South]] that led to the [[Atlanta Campaign]] of 1864.

==Background==
After their disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 40,000 men of the Union [[Army of the Cumberland]] under [[Major General]] [[William Rosecrans]] retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Confederate General Braxton Bragg's [[Army of Tennessee]] besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. His pursuit to the city outskirts had been leisurely, giving the Union soldiers time to prepare defenses. Bragg's troops established themselves on [[Missionary Ridge]] and [[Lookout Mountain]], both of which had excellent views of the city, the [[Tennessee River]] (which flows through the city) and the Union's supply lines. Confederate artillery atop Lookout Mountain controlled access by the river, and Confederate cavalry launched raids on all supply wagons heading toward Chattanooga, which made it necessary for the Union to find another way to feed their men.

The Union government, alarmed by the potential for defeat, sent reinforcements. On [[October 17]], Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant received command of the Western armies, designated the Military Division of the Mississippi; he moved to reinforce Chattanooga and replaced Rosecrans with Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]]. Devising a plan known as the "Cracker Line", Grant's chief engineer, [[William Farrar Smith|William F. "Baldy" Smith]], launched a surprise amphibious landing at Brown's Ferry that opened the Tennessee River by linking up Thomas's Army of the Cumberland with a relief column of 20,000 troops led by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], thus allowing supplies and reinforcements to flow into Chattanooga, greatly increasing the chances for Grant's forces. In response, Bragg ordered Confederate [[Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]] to force the Federals out of Lookout Valley. The ensuing [[Battle of Wauhatchie]] ([[October 28]] to [[October 29]]) was one of the war's few battles fought exclusively at night. The Confederates were repulsed, and the Cracker Line was secured.  

Bragg weakened his forces by sending Longstreet's corps against Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]] near [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. When Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] arrived with his four divisions (20,000 men) in mid-November, Grant began offensive operations.

==Initial movements==
On [[November 23]], Union forces under Thomas struck out and advanced east to capture a line from Orchard Knob and Indian Hill to Bushy Knob, and including Bald Knob (now the site of Chattanooga National Military Cemetery), placing them halfway to the summit of Missionary Ridge. The advance met little Confederate resistance. Bragg moved Walker's division (under Brig. Gen. [[States Rights Gist]]) from Lookout Mountain to strengthen his left flank.

==Battle of Lookout Mountain==
[[Image:Chattanooga Battle.png|thumb|400px|Battle of Chattanooga]]
The plan for [[November 24]] was a two-pronged attack&mdash;Hooker against the Confederate left, Sherman the right. Hooker's three divisions struck at dawn at Lookout Mountain and found that the defile between the mountain and the river had not been secured. They barreled right through this opening; the assault ended around 3:00 p.m. when ammunition ran low and fog had enveloped the mountain. This action has been called the "Battle above the Clouds" because of that fog. Bragg withdrew his forces from the southern end of the mountain to a line behind Chattanooga Creek, burning the bridges behind him.

Sherman crossed the Tennessee River successfully, then took what he thought was the north end of Missionary Ridge but was actually a completely separate rise known as Billy Goat Hill. The division of [[Patrick Cleburne]] was rushed in to reinforce the Confederate right flank at Tunnel Hill on the north end of the ridge. No attack occurred on this flank on [[November 24]].

==Battle of Missionary Ridge== 
On [[November 25]], Grant changed his plan and called for a [[double envelopment]] by Sherman and Hooker. Thomas was to advance after Sherman reached Missionary Ridge from the north. The Ridge was a formidable defensive position, manned in depth, and Grant knew that a frontal assault against it would be suicidal, unless it could be arranged in support of the [[flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]] by Sherman and Hooker. As the morning progressed, Sherman was unable to break Cleburne's line, and Hooker's advance was slowed by the burned bridges on the creek. At 3:30 p.m., Grant was concerned that Bragg was reinforcing his right flank at Sherman's expense. Hence, he ordered Thomas to move forward and try to seize the first of three lines of Confederate entrenchments to his front. 

The Union soldiers moved forward and captured the first line but were subjected there to punishing fire from the two remaining Confederate lines up the ridge. Most of Thomas's troops had been at the disastrous loss at Chickamauga and had suffered taunts by Sherman's and Burnside's newly arrived forces. Now they were under fire from above with no apparent plan to advance or move back. Without orders, the Union soldiers continued the attack against the remaining lines. They advanced doggedly up the steep slope, shouting "Chickamauga, Chickamauga!" until they finally overwhelmed and captured the remaining Confederate lines. Bragg had placed his artillery and trenches of the infantry along the actual crest of the ridge, rather than the [[military crest]], and they were unable to provide effective fire. Nonetheless, the Army of the Cumberland's ascent of Missionary Ridge was one of the war's most dramatic events. A Union officer remembered that
{{cquote|little regard to formation was observed. Each battalion assumed a triangular shape, the colors at the apex. ... [a] color-bearer dashes ahead of the line and falls. A comrade grasps the flag. ... He, too, falls. Then another picks it up ... waves it defiantly, and as if bearing a charmed life, he advances steadily towards the top ...<ref>Catton, p. 439.</ref>}}

Grant was initially furious that his orders had not been followed exactly. Thomas was taken by surprise as well, knowing that he would be blamed if the assault failed. But it succeeded. By 4:30 p.m., the center of Bragg's line broke and fled in panic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat eastward to the Chickamauga River (also known as South Chickamauga Creek).

==Aftermath==
During the night, Bragg ordered his army to withdraw toward Chickamauga Station (currently the site of Lovell Air Field) and the following day began retreating from there toward [[Dalton, Georgia]], in two columns taking two different routes. During the retreat, minor battles were fought at Chickamauga Station, at Shepherd's Run in Hickory Valley, at Cat Creek (Mackey Branch) in old Concord community, and at Graysville, Georgia.  The date, [[November 26]], was coincidentally the first official American [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]].

The pursuit ordered by Grant was effectively thwarted at the [[Battle of Ringgold Gap]]. Casualties for the Union Army amounted to 5,824 (753 killed, 4,722 wounded, and 349 missing) of about 56,000 engaged; Confederate casualties were 6,667 (361 killed, 2,160 wounded, and 4,146 missing, mostly prisoners) of about 44,000. When a chaplain asked General Thomas whether the dead should be sorted and buried by state, Thomas replied "Mix 'em up. I'm tired of [[States' rights]]."<ref>Eicher, p. 613.</ref>

One of the Confederacy's two major armies was routed. The Union held Chattanooga, the "Gateway to the Lower South." It became the supply and logistics base for Sherman's 1864 Atlanta Campaign, as well as for the Army of the Cumberland, and Grant had won his final battle in the [[Western Campaign of the American Civil War|West]] prior to receiving command of all Union armies in March 1864.
