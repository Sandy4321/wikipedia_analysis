'''Merseyside''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>m<U+025D><U+02D0>zisa<U+026A>d}}) is a [[metropolitan county]] in [[North West England]], with a population of 1,365,900. Taking its name from the [[River Mersey]], the title "Merseyside" came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974, after the passage of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and the county consists of five [[metropolitan borough]]s adjoining the [[Mersey Estuary]], including the [[Liverpool|City of Liverpool]].

[[Merseyside County Council]] was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. However, the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference.<ref name="Office of National Statistics">[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/ons_geography/Gazetteer_v3.pdf Office of National Statistics] - Gazetteer of the old and new geographies of the United Kingdom, p48.

Merseyside is divided into two parts by the Mersey Estuary: the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]] is located to the west of the estuary on the [[Wirral Peninsula]]; the rest of the county is located on the eastern side of the estuary. The eastern boroughs of Merseyside border [[Lancashire]] to the north and [[Greater Manchester]] to the east, and both parts of Merseyside, west and east of the estuary, border [[Cheshire]] to the south.

The territory comprising the county of Merseyside previously consisted of the [[county borough]]s of [[Birkenhead]], [[Wallasey]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bootle]], [[Southport]] and [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]. Birkenhead and Wallasey were part of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Cheshire, whilst Liverpool, Bootle, Southport and St Helens were part of the administrative county of Lancashire.

==History==
[[Image:Seaforth Docks.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port of Liverpool]] docks, at [[Seaforth, Merseyside|Seaforth]]. Merseyside lies at the [[River Mersey|Mersey Estuary]].]]
Merseyside was designated as a "Special Review" area in the [[Local Government Act 1958]], and the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1966)|Local Government Commission for England]] started a review of this area in 1962, based around the core county boroughs of [[Liverpool]]/[[Bootle]]/[[Birkenhead]]/[[Wallasey]]. Further areas, including [[Widnes]] and [[Runcorn]], were added to the Special Review Area by Order in 1965. Draft proposals were published in 1965, but the commission never completed its final proposals as it was abolished in 1966.

Instead, a [[Royal Commission]] was set up to review English local government entirely, and its report (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]) proposed a much wider Merseyside metropolitan area covering southwest Lancashire and northwest Cheshire, extending as far south as [[Chester]] and as far north as the [[River Ribble]]. This would have included four districts: [[Southport]]/[[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], [[Liverpool]]/[[Bootle]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]/[[Widnes]] and [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]]/[[Chester]].

In 1970 the [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (which operates under the ''Merseytravel'' brand) was set up, covering the Liverpool and Wirral [[conurbation]]s, but excluding St. Helens.

The Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the incoming [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government, but the concept of a two-tier metropolitan area based on the Mersey area was retained. A [[White Paper]] was published in 1971. The [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Bill]] presented to Parliament involved a substantial trimming from the White Paper, excluding the northern and southern fringes of the area, excluding Chester, Ellesmere Port (and, unusually, including Southport, whose council had requested to be included). Further alterations took place in Parliament, with [[Skelmersdale]] being removed from the area, and a proposed district including St Helens and [[Huyton]] being subdivided into what are now the metropolitan boroughs of [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]].

Merseyside was created on 1 April, 1974 from areas previously parts of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]], along with the county boroughs of Birkenhead, Wallasey, Liverpool, Bootle, and St Helens. Following the creation of Merseyside, Merseytravel expanded to take in St Helens and Southport.

Between 1974 and 1986 the county had a two-tier system of local government with the five boroughs sharing power with the [[Merseyside County Council]]. However in 1986 the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] abolished the county council along with all other metropolitan county councils, and so its boroughs are now effectively [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]].

Merseyside however still exists legally, both as a metropolitan and [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].<ref name="Office of National Statistics"/><ref name="Metropolitan Counties and Districts"/><ref name="North West England Counties"/>

==Geography==
[[Image:Merseyside aerial photograph.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of Merseyside]]
{{seealso|List of places in Merseyside}}
Merseyside is divided into two parts by the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] Estuary, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] is located on the west side of the estuary, upon the [[Wirral Peninsula]] and the rest of the county is located on the east side of the estuary. The eastern part of Merseyside borders onto [[Lancashire]] to the north, [[Greater Manchester]] to the east, with both parts of the county bordering [[Cheshire]] to the south. The territory comprising the county of Merseyside previously formed part of the [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of Lancashire (east of the River Mersey) and Cheshire (west of the River Mersey).

The two parts are linked by two [[Mersey Tunnels|road tunnels]], [[Mersey Railway|a railway tunnel]], and the famous [[Mersey Ferry]].

==Identity==
To express location within the Merseyside area by the preposition ''on'' - thus "on Merseyside" as opposed to "in Merseyside" - was traditionally the more usual. However, the logic of suggestions in support of this from some quarters (that, after all, one would always be "on<U+201D> the side of the Mersey, not "in" it) falls down; since it is, in fact, entirely possible to be situated [both] "in" or "on" [either] <U+201C>side<U+201D> of the River Mersey and area(s) thus designated. Therefore, more recent usage tends to draw distinctions between the geographical "Merseyside" - for which "on" is considered appropriate - and the Metropolitan county of "Merseyside", for which "in" is used.

MORI polls in the boroughs of Sefton and Wirral in the 2000s showed that more residents in these boroughs identified strongly to Merseyside than to Lancashire or Cheshire respectively (but was less likely to be "very strong" as opposed to "fairly strong").<ref>[http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/9335 Sefton poll], where 51% residents belonged strongly to Merseyside, and compared with 35% to Lancashire;  [http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/templates/search/document.cfm/9357 Wirral poll], where 45% of residents belonged strongly to Merseyside; compared with 30% to Cheshire.  In both boroughs, "very strongly" ratings for the historic county were larger than that for Merseyside, but "fairly strongly" was lower.</ref>

==Local government==
[[Image:Merseyside CoA.svg|thumb|right|Arms of the [[Merseyside County Council]].]]
===Metropolitan boroughs===
Merseyside contains the [[metropolitan borough]]s of [[Liverpool]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]].

===County level functions===
Despite the abolition of the county council some local services are still run on a county-wide basis, now administered by [[Local government in the United Kingdom#Joint-boards|joint-boards]] of the five metropolitan boroughs; these include the: 

*[[Merseyside Police]]
*[[Merseyside Fire Service|Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service]]
*[[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive|Merseytravel]] (who are also responsible for the [[Merseyrail]] network)
*[[Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority]]
*Merseyside Pension Scheme, administered by Wirral Borough Council, with offices in Liverpool

Several organisations are still recognised using the old name of "Merseyside". The court service at [[Magistrates Courts, Liverpool|Liverpool's Magistrate Court]] for example, registered the domain merseysidemcc.org.uk on 25 March 2000, more than a decade after the Merseyside Council was abolished.

==Greater Merseyside==

Other nearby towns that are not part of Merseyside, such as [[Skelmersdale]], [[Ormskirk]], [[Warrington]], [[Runcorn]], [[Widnes]] and [[Ellesmere Port]], the designation "[[Greater Merseyside]]" has sometimes been adopted for the area unofficially although has a semi-official usage by some local authorities and organisations and is used by Geographers' A-Z Map Company for their Merseyside Street Atlas.<ref>[http://www.a-zmaps.co.uk/?nid=60&iid=1603&pts=1,2,3,4,5,6,&s=Liverpool&t=0&st=1 Merseyside Street Atlas]</ref>
However, a separate '[[City region]]', comprising Merseyside and [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], is more officially recognised as Greater Merseyside, although it has also been referred to as [[Liverpool City Region]].
