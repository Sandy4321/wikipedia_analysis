'''HMS ''Hurricane'''''  was an [[G and H class destroyer|H-class]] [[destroyer]] that had originally been ordered by the [[Brazilian Navy]] in the late 1930s with the name ''Japarua'', but was bought by the [[Royal Navy]] after the beginning of [[World War II]] in September 1939 and later renamed. When completed in June 1940, the ship was temporarily assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] before she began escorting convoys and conducting [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]]. She was badly damaged during a German air raid on [[Liverpool]] in May 1941 and her repairs were not completed until the beginning of 1942. ''Hurricane'' was then assigned as the [[flotilla leader]] of [[Escort Group (naval)|Escort Group]] B1 assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]], escorting convoys in the North Atlantic for the next two years. The ship was torpedoed by a German [[submarine]] on [[Christmas Eve]] 1943, and had to be [[scuttled]] the next day as she was unable to steam back to port. 

==Description==
''Hurricane'' displaced {{convert|1350|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1883|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Hurricane'' carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of fuel oil, giving her a range of {{convert|5530|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.<ref name=w78>Whitley, p. 109</ref> The ship's complement was 152 officers and men.<ref name=l3>Lenton, p. 163</ref>

The vessel was designed for four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear, but 'Y' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Hurricane'' had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&nbsp;inch Vickers Mark III]] [[machine gun]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref name=w78/> One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while [[fitting-out]]. The ship's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.<ref>English, p. 141</ref><ref>Friedman, p. 226</ref> She was fitted with an [[ASDIC]] set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.<ref>Brown, p. 164</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
Little data on ''Hurricane''{{'}}s modifications during the war has survived, although it is known that she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] AA gun by October 1940.<ref>Friedman, p. 241</ref> The ship's short-range AA armament may been augmented by two [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] guns on the wings of the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and the .50-calibre machine gun mounts may have also been replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. The ship's [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] may have been removed in exchange for a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication radar. A [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted mid-way through the war. The ship probably also received a [[HF/DF]] [[radio direction finder]] mounted on a pole [[mainmast]].<ref name=l3/>

==Service==
''Japarua'' was ordered by Brazil on 6 December 1937 from [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 3 June 1938 and she was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II. Renamed HMS ''Hurricane'', the ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 September and commissioned on 21 June 1940.<ref>English, p. 127</ref> She was assigned to the [[9th Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Home Fleet upon commissioning until new construction replaced the losses suffered over the previous few months. ''Hurricane'' then began escorting convoys and conducting anti-submarine patrols until May 1941. On 17 September, the ship rescued survivors of the {{SS|City of Benares}}, a small passenger ship evacuating 90 children from the United Kingdom to Canada, and the freighter {{SS|Marina|1935|6}}. She rescued 451 survivors from the freighter {{SS|City of Nagpur}} and landed them at [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]] on 1 May 1941.<ref name=e4>English, p. 134</ref>

''Hurricane'' was bombed and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool during the night of 7/8 May. She was struck by a bomb that passed through the hull and detonated underneath her. The explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and ''Hurricane'' was moved to [[Bidston Dock]] lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.<ref name=e4/>

The ship was repaired and returned to service in January 1942 as flotilla leader of Escort Group B1 assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force. ''Hurricane'' remained as the leader for the next two years.<ref name=e4/> Whilst escorting Convoy OS 62/KMS 36, the ship was hit by an [[G7es torpedo|acoustic T5 torpedo]] fired by [[German submarine U-415|''U-415'']] on the evening of 24 December 1943.<ref>Rohwer, p. 294</ref> The torpedo homed in on the ship's propeller noises and blew off {{convert|30|ft|1}} of her stern. The explosion killed three and wounded nine of her crew, and rendered her unable to move. The following morning, she was scuttled by the destroyer {{HMS|Watchman|D26|2}} at {{coord|45|10|N|22|05|W}}.<ref name=e4/>
