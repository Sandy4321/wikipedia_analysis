'''Pyramid Head''', also known as {{Nihongo|"Triangle Head"|<U+4E09><U+89D2><U+982D>|Sankaku Atama}} in Japan,<ref name="director"/> is a [[List of Silent Hill monsters|monster]] from the [[survival horror|survival-horror]] ''[[Silent Hill]]'' [[List of video game franchises|video game series]], published by [[Konami]]. Introduced in the 2001 installment ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', he stalks the primary [[player-character]] James Sunderland, who comes to Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his deceased wife, and executes James' companion Maria<U+2014>who strongly resembles James' wife except for her provocative clothes and behavior<U+2014>multiple times. He also sexually assaults several monsters over the course of the game. The ''Silent Hill'' series frequently makes use of psychology and symbolism: Pyramid Head represents James' wish to be punished for his "sins".

[[Masahiro Ito]], the designer of ''Silent Hill 2''{{'}}s monsters, created him with the goal of having "a monster with a hidden face".<ref name="Making of"/> Known for the large triangular helmet which conceals his head, Pyramid Head is unusual for a video game antagonist since he lacks a voice, a visible face, [[back-story]], and reason for his actions.<ref name="PH Allure 1"/> He has since appeared in the 2006 film ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' as "Red Pyramid", in the 2007 first-person shooter ''[[Silent Hill: The Arcade]]'' as a [[boss (gaming)|boss]], and in the fifth installment of the series, ''[[Silent Hill: Homecoming]]'', as the "Bogeyman". He has also made an appearance outside of the ''Silent Hill'' series as a selectable character in the 2008 [[Nintendo DS]] title ''[[New International Track & Field]]''. Critical reaction to him in ''Silent Hill 2'' has been favorable for his appearance and role as an element of James' psyche.

==Design and characteristics==
Of the creatures that appeared in ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', only Pyramid Head features an "overtly masculine" appearance.<ref name="PH Allure 1"/> Pyramid Head resembles a pale, muscular man covered with a white, blood-soaked robe reminiscent of a butcher's smock. Pyramid Head does not speak, but grunts and moans painfully inside the helmet.<ref name="PH Allure 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_112/1372-Seeing-Red|title=The Escapist: Seeing Red: The Repulsive Allure of Pyramid Head <U+2013> Page 1|author=Gonz<U+00E1>lez, Christina|date=2007-08-28|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|''The Escapist'']]|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> His most outstanding feature is a large red, triangular helmet that covers his head completely.<ref name="PH Allure 1"/> [[Masahiro Ito]], the designer of ''Silent Hill 2''{{'}}s monsters, wanted to create "a monster with a hidden face", which lead him to add the pyramid-shaped helm. According to him, the possibility of pain is suggested, because of the triangle's sharp right and acute angles.<ref name="Making of">Konami. ''The Making of Silent Hill 2 DVD''. KCET, 2002.</ref> At times, it appears that Pyramid Head is in pain and suffering.<ref name="PH Allure 1"/> His weapons consist of the deadly and heavy Great Knife, which the player can later find and use as a weapon for the rest of the game,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Silent Hill 2|developer=Konami (Team Silent)|publisher=Konami|date=2001-09-21|platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''On-screen text:''' I got a great knife.}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game|title=Silent Hill 2|developer=Konami (Team Silent)|publisher=Konami|date=2001-09-21|platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''On-screen text:''' Massive weapon wielded by Pyramid Head.

As revealed by Konami's ''The Book of Lost Memories'', Pyramid Head's appearance was a variation of the outfits of the executioners from the fictional history of the town, who wore red hoods and ceremonial robes to make themselves similar to [[List of Silent Hill monsters#Common enemies 3|Valtiel]],<ref name="pp 84-85">{{cite book|title=The Book of Lost Memories|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Konami]]|location=Japan|date=2003|pages=84<U+2013>85|chapter=1: The Magician|isbn=4757181450}}</ref> a monster who appears in ''[[Silent Hill 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/482701/page_5.html|title=Silent Hill 3 Guide/Walkthrough <U+2013> Enemies|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> Pyramid Head was created from "the townspeoples' idolatrous ideologies".<ref name="pp 84-85"/> Pyramid Head also shares traits with Valtiel, such as similar gloves, cloth stitching, and following the protagonist of the game.<ref name="pp 84-85"/> [[Christophe Gans]], the director of the [[2006 in film|2006 film]] adaption ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', suggests that Pyramid Head "was one of the executioners in the original history of the town" and that "there is not one particular or exclusive manifestation of him as an entity."<ref name="PH film names"/>

==Appearances==
===''Silent Hill 2''===
After receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, and arriving in the foggy town of Silent Hill to search for her, the protagonist and primary [[player-character]] James Sunderland encounters Pyramid Head several times over the course of the game. He first appears from behind a gate and makes no attempt to attack him.<ref name="PH Allure 1"/> Later in an apartment, James walks in on his rape and murder of two Mannequins<U+2014>creatures made of two sets of hips and legs.<ref name="Alexander analysis"/> Terrified and panicked, James hides in a closet and shoots Pyramid Head with a handgun several times, which causes him to leave. James witnesses Pyramid Head's rape of another creature when near a flooded stairway and Pyramid Head attempts to kill him. After a few minutes, sirens sound in the distance and Pyramid Head descends the stairway, removing the water.<ref name="Well Played analysis">{{cite web|url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/content/silent-hill-2-doris-c-rusch|title=Staring Into The Abyss <U+2013> A Close Reading of Silent Hill 2|date=2009-03-10|work=Well Played 1.0: Video Games, Value and Meaning|author=Rusch, Doris C.|publisher=ETC-Press|accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>

As James flees into an elevator, the doors shut before she can join him. He struggles to open the doors to save her, but Pyramid Head kills her. However, in the [[labyrinth]] beneath Toluca Prison, James finds her alive and unharmed behind a locked grate. She displays a memory that only he and Mary shared, before trying to [[seduce]] him. He leaves, promising to find a way to her, and discovers that Pyramid Head walks a corridor nearby, now carrying a spear. James reaches the room behind the grate soon afterwards, but finds her dead. Pyramid Head makes his final appearance just before the final boss, where two Pyramid Heads take part in the encounter. They kill Maria yet again and after pursuing him around the room for a while, both commit [[suicide]].<ref name="Well Played analysis"/><ref name="Alexander analysis">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/07/the_aberrant_gamer_sundering_the_mind.php|title=Column: The Aberrant Gamer - 'Sundering the Mind'|author=Alexander, Leigh|date=2007-07-19|publisher=GameSetWatch|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref>

===Film===
Pyramid Head makes an appearance in the [[2006 in film|2006 film adaption]] ''Silent Hill'' as "Red Pyramid" and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella.
