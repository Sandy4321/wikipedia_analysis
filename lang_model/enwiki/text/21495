Lampeter is believed to be the first town in Wales to field a rugby union team when in 1850 the Reverend Professor Rowland Williams brought the game with him from Cambridge to St. David's College, Lampeter.<ref>''Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981'', David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp22 ISBN 0708307663</ref>  Although no evidence exists of the origination of Lampeter RFC as a separate club team from Lampeter College there is written proof of a match in the [[Western Mail (Wales)|''Western Mail'']] between the college team and a Lampeter club in 1879. In 1881 the ''Carmarthen Journal'' reported a club from Lampeter was represented in the formation of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]]. <ref>''Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981'', David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp41 ISBN 0708307663</ref> In 1885 Lampeter RFC fielded their first [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh]] international player, E.M. Rowlands, in a game against [[England national rugby union team|England]]. <ref>''Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981'', David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp471 ISBN 0708307663</ref>
