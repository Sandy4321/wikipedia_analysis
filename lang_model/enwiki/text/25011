'''Shane Kalani del Rosario''' (September 23, 1983 <U+2013> December 9, 2013) was an [[Americans|American]] professional [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] and [[Muay Thai|kickboxer]].  He competed in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]'s [[Heavyweight (MMA)|Heavyweight]] division, [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]], [[M-1 Global]], [[ShoXC]], and [[King of the Cage]].  He held the distinction of being the first American to become the WBC Muay Thai World Heavyweight Champion.

==Early life==
Del Rosario was born and raised in [[Orange County, California]], and was of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] descent. He started training as a fighter at the age of 17 with [[Marco Ruas]]. Del Rosario then attended and graduated from college with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]] out of [[UC Irvine]].

==Kickboxing career==
Del Rosario competed as a Heavyweight in [[Muay Thai]] on the World Championship Kickboxing series of [[kickboxing]] events and In Sync Productions Inc.

On November 9, 2006, Shane Del Rosario fought Tyler Grear. After surviving a spinning backfist that stunned him in round one, Del Rosario dropped Grear with a power punch early in round two. Grear could not beat the referee's 10-count as Del Rosario was declared the winner by knockout at 16 seconds of the second round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefightgame.tv/wck_kickboxing_november_9_2006_fight_gallery_results.htm|title=Full Rules Muay Thai Recap at The San Manuel Indian Bingo & Casino|publisher=The FIGHT GAME Tv}}</ref>

After defeating Justin Carver by first round knockout on January 11, 2007, Shane then fought reigning [[WBC Muay Thai]] International Heavyweight Champion [[Ricardo van den Bos]] for the vacant WBC Muay Thai World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rosario dominated van den Bos throughout the majority of the bout. After dropping van den Bos twice in round number two, Del Rosario landed a knee that finished Ricardo van den Bos at the last second of the round. He was then declared the winner by knockout at 3:00 of round two and the new WBC Muay Thai World Heavyweight Champion. He would also become the first [[People of the United States|American]] to have won the WBC Muay Thai World Heavyweight title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefightgame.tv/wck_muay_thai_september_8_2007_recap_results.htm|title=World Championship Muay Thai Recap \ Results|publisher=The FIGHT GAME Tv}}</ref>

Del Rosario's first career loss came in his first title defense against [[Dutch people|Dutch]] kickboxer [[Ginty Vrede]]. Going into the bout as the fan favorite, he appeared to hurt Vrede in the opening round. Vrede came back with a powerful hook that stunned del Rosario and forced a standing eight-count by referee Steve Mazzagatti. After beating the count, del Rosario was dropped by an immediate high kick. The referee stopped the fight at 2:24 of the first round and declared Vrede the new WBC Muay Thai World Heavyweight Champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefightgame.tv/wck_muay_thai_january_12_2008_recap_results.htm|title=WCK: Full Rules Muaythai Recap|publisher=The FIGHT GAME Tv}}</ref>
