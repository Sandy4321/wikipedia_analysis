He performs as '''T.M.Revolution''' (TMR), which stands for  {{nihongo|''Takanori Makes Revolution''|<U+8CB4><U+6559><U+304C><U+9769><U+547D><U+3092><U+8D77><U+3053><U+3059>|Takanori ga kakumei o okosu}}.  Although most of his songs were written by [[Akio Inoue]] and composed/arranged by [[Daisuke Asakura]] (also TMR<U+2019>s former producer), T.M.Revolution is Nishikawa<U+2019>s solo project.

Nishikawa debuted as TMR with the release of his first single {{nihongo|''Dokusai -monopolize-''|<U+72EC><U+88C1> -monopolize-|}} in May 1996.  Later that year, his third single {{nihongo|''HEART OF SWORD ~Yoake Mae~''|HEART OF SWORD <U+FF5E><U+591C><U+660E><U+3051><U+524D><U+FF5E>|}} was used as the third ending song for the [[anime]] series ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', further expanding his fan base.  He also contributed six songs to the ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'' franchise <U+2013> three for ''Gundam SEED'' and three for ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny|Gundam SEED Destiny]]''.  Nishikawa has guest starred as a minor character in each of those anime series that featured his songs.

T.M.Revolution is the first artist to be signed to [[Tofu Records]], a record label (affiliated with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music Japan]]) promoting j-pop artists in [[North America]].  Tofu released three of his most recent studio albums: ''coordinate'' (2003), ''SEVENTH HEAVEN'' (2004), and ''vertical infinity'' (2005).  Nishikawa made his North American live debut at [[Otakon]], a large [[Fan convention|anime convention]] in 2003.  He has also performed at [[Pacific Media Expo]] in 2004 and at the [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nishikawa was born to a government worker (father, Yasuhiro) and a dentist (mother, Kazuko).<ref><U+201C>Names of Takanori<U+2019>s Parents,<U+201D> ''Winds-Turbo Blog: Trivia'', 14 April 2006, accessed 29 July 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbotrivia/diary/200604140003/>.</ref>  He attended {{nihongo|Mikami Elementary School|<U+4E09><U+4E0A><U+5C0F><U+5B66><U+6821>|Mikami Sh<U+014D>gakk<U+014D>}}<ref>Marimaru, <U+201C>Takanori Bus Tour: Mikami Elementary School,<U+201D> ''Winds-Turbo Blog'', 15 June 2006, accessed 27 July 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200606150000/>.</ref> as a child.  Nishikawa was close to his grandfather (a retired policeman), whom he visited every day after school, since his parents were always working.  Under the encouragement of his grandfather, Takanori studied [[kendo]] until age ten, when his grandfather passed away due to illness.<ref>Taka, <U+201C>Live Report in Omiya on 5 May,<U+201D> Ibid., 7 May 2006, accessed 27 July 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200605070000/>.</ref>

Nishikawa also attended {{nihongo|Yasu Junior High School|<U+91CE><U+6D32><U+4E2D><U+5B66><U+6821>|Yasu Ch<U+016B>gakk<U+014D>}}<ref>Marimaru, <U+201C>Takanori Bus Tour: Yasu Junior High School,<U+201D> Ibid., 21 June 2006, accessed 27 July 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200606210000/>.</ref> and {{nihongo|Yasu High School|<U+6ECB><U+8CC0><U+770C><U+7ACB><U+91CE><U+6D32><U+9AD8><U+7B49><U+5B66><U+6821>|Shiga Kenritsu Yasu K<U+014D>t<U+014D> Gakk<U+014D>}}.<ref>Ibid., <U+201C>Takanori Bus Tour: Yasu High School,<U+201D> Ibid., 12 June 2006, accessed 27 July 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200606120000/>.</ref>  While in junior high, Takanori began to consider a career in music.<ref name="interview">Jonathan Mays, interview with T.M.Revolution, <U+201C>Sound Decision,<U+201D> ''[[Anime News Network]]'', 10 June 2004, accessed 5 August 2006 <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/sound-decision/2004-06-10>.</ref>  He dropped out of high school and left Shiga to pursue his dream.
Takanori was also married to Yumi Yoshimura of PuffyAmiYumi from 1999 to 2002. He divorced her after finding out that she was meeting someone else.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

===Luis-Mary===
Nishikawa joined a [[Visual Kei|visual kei]] band Luis-Mary in 1990 as the vocalist.  His band nickname {{nihongo|Haine|<U+7070><U+732B>||}} and his appearance at the time would eventually become the inspiration for Nishikawa<U+2019>s character in ''Gundam SEED Destiny'' ([[Heine Westenfluss]]).  Luis-Mary released three singles, ''Rainy Blue'', ''Whisper(in your eyes)'', and ''Drive me mad''. The band broke up in 1993.

===Debut as T.M.Revolution===
In 1995, Daisuke Asakura signed on with Nishikawa under the FunHouse label, now owned by [[BMG|BMG Japan]].  They released one single, ''BLACK OR WHITE?'', under the name '''Daisuke Asakura expd. Takanori Nishikawa'''.<ref>hybrid_incubi, <U+201C>Behind the Music: Takanori Nishikawa,<U+201D> ''tmrevolutionist'', 28 June 2006, accessed 29 July 2006 <http://community.livejournal.com/tmrevolutionist/141135.html>.</ref>  This song was rerecorded in 1997<ref name="jawiki"><U+201C><U+897F><U+5DDD><U+8CB4><U+6559> [Takanori Nishikawa],<U+201D> ''Wikipedia'' (Japanese ed.), 23 July 2006, accessed 29 July 2006 <http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=<U+897F><U+5DDD><U+8CB4><U+6559>&oldid=6768716#.E3.82.B7.E3.83.B3.E3.82.B0.E3.83.AB>.</ref> and also rearranged in 2000 as TMR<U+2019>s twelfth single (''BLACK OR WHITE? version 3'').  The original <U+201C>BLACK OR WHITE?<U+201D> song also appears as the third track on TMR<U+2019>s first album ''MAKES REVOLUTION'' (1996).  Nishikawa participated in a mini three-band event in November 1995.  His fan club, turbo, was established shortly afterwards, in December 1995.  In early 1996, Nishikawa made several radio appearances announcing the debut of his solo project.  On March 22, 1996, the project was given the name T.M.Revolution, with Asakura named as TMR<U+2019>s producer.<ref name="tmr"><U+201C>Biography of Takanori<U+2019>s Music Works,<U+201D> ''100% Takanori Nishikawa Site'', accessed 7 August 2006 <http://www.takanori-nishikawa.com/turbo_biofiles_biography.shtml>.</ref>

===''MAKES REVOLUTION'' era===
''Dokusai -monopolize-'' was released on May 13, 1996 under the Antinos Records label.  It reached #28 on the [[Oricon]] charts.  Nishikawa<U+2019>s performance on [[NHK]]<U+2019>s music variety show ''Pop Jam'' (which he would, later in his career, cohost for eleven months) helped boost sales, eventually selling out all first press copies of the single.  His second single, {{nihongo|''Hesoshukujo -Venus-''|<U+81CD><U+6DD1><U+5973> -<U+30F4><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30CA><U+30B9>-|}} was released two months later, followed by the release of TMR<U+2019>s first album (''MAKES REVOLUTION'') another month later.

===''restoration LEVEL<U+279D>3'' era===
''HEART OF SWORD ~Yoake Mae~'' was released in November 1996 and was used as the third ending song for ''Rurouni Kenshin''.  It later replaced <U+201C>Fourth Avenue Cafe<U+201D> (by rock band [[L'Arc~en~Ciel]]) as the fourth ending song, due to drug charges laid against a (now former) member of that band at the time.  <U+201C>HEART OF SWORD ~''Yoake Mae''~<U+201D> became a fan favourite that sold 360,000 copies and reached #16 on the [[Oricon]] charts.  Nishikawa<U+2019>s second album, ''restoration LEVEL<U+279D>3'' [sometimes called {{nihongo|''Ishin Level<U+279D>3''|<U+7DAD><U+65B0><U+30EC><U+30D9><U+30EB><U+279D>3|}}] was released in February 1997, which reached #5 on the Oricon charts.

===''triple joker'' era===
Nishikawa released three singles, ''LEVEL 4'', ''HIGH PRESSURE'', and ''WHITE BREATH'', in 1997.  ''HIGH PRESSURE'' became TMR<U+2019>s breakthrough single, selling 800,000 copies.  ''WHITE BREATH'' sold over one million copies and became the first TMR single to reach #1 on the Oricon charts.  Nishikawa performed ''WHITE BREATH'' on the 48th edition of ''[[K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen]]'', an annual music show televised by NHK.  Less than a month later, his third album ''triple joker'' was released and went on to sell two million copies.  {{nihongo|''Aoi Hekireki''|<U+84BC><U+3044><U+9739><U+9742>|}}, the first track from ''triple joker'', was recut as a single in February 1998 and it was used in a [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] JOG commercial.<ref name="tmr" />  Nishikawa<U+2019>s three albums were also released in other parts of Asia, and he visited [[Taiwan]] in April 1998 to promote ''triple joker''.

===''the force'' era===
''HOT LIMIT'', released in June 1998, sold 900,000 copies and became Nishikawa<U+2019>s second #1 single.  Nishikawa also performed at the 49th edition of ''K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen''.  His fourth album, ''the force'', was released in March 1999 and featured album mixes of the four singles (''HOT LIMIT'', ''THUNDERBIRD'', ''Burnin<U+2019> X<U+2019>mas'', ''WILD RUSH'') that followed ''Aoi Hekireki''.  Shortly after ''the force'' was released, Nishikawa performed two concerts at [[Tokyo Dome]] to a total audience of 100,000.

===the end of genesis T.M.Revolution turbo type D===
In 1999, Nishikawa announced the end of T.M.Revolution.<ref name="tmr"/>  He and Daisuke Asakura went on to form '''the end of genesis T.M.R.evolution turbo type D''' (or TMR-e, for short).  The name implied it was an <U+201C>evolution<U+201D> of TMR.  Asakura also appeared in their music videos and performed alongside Nishikawa.  Three singles were released under that name, all in 1999: {{nihongo|''Kager<U+014D>''|<U+967D><U+708E> -KAGEROH-|}}, {{nihongo|''Gekk<U+014D>''|<U+6708><U+8679> -GEKKOH-|}}, and {{nihongo|''Setsugen -winter dust-''|<U+96EA><U+5E7B> -winter dust-|}}.  Their only album, ''Suite Season'', was released in February 2000.  Nishikawa and Asakura started becoming more distant from each other, and Nishikawa reverted back to his original [[stage name]] in April 2000.

===''progress'' era===
''BLACK OR WHITE? version 3'', a self-cover, was released in April 2000.  It was used as a professional baseball theme song on [[Nippon Television]].<ref name="tmr" />  Two other singles [''HEAT CAPACITY'' and {{nihongo|''Madan ~Der Freisch<U+00FC>tz~''|<U+9B54><U+5F3E> <U+FF5E>Der Freisch<U+00FC>tz<U+FF5E>|}}], a [[remix album]] (''DISCORdanza: Try My Remix ~Single Collections~''), and studio album (''progress''; TMR<U+2019>s fifth) were also released in 2000.

===''coordinate'' era===
''BOARDING'' was released in February 2001.  The title track of the single was used as a theme song to a drama called {{nihongo|''To Make Divided a House''|<U+5225><U+308C><U+3055><U+305B><U+5C4B>|Wakaresase Ya}}.<ref name="tmr" />  Nishikawa started self-producing, with the release of his sixteenth single (''Out of Orbit ~Triple ZERO~'') one year later.  (Asakura continued to compose music for TMR.)  His compilation album ''B<U+2606>E<U+2606>S<U+2606>T'' was released the next month.  Epic Records Japan purchased Antinos Records that year, and all albums on the Antinos catalogue were re-released under the Epic label on July 1, 2002.  <U+201C>THUNDERBIRD<U+201D> inspired anime director [[Mitsuo Fukuda]] to ask Nishikawa to perform the first opening song for ''Gundam SEED'' (<U+201C>INVOKE<U+201D>).  ''INVOKE'', released in September 2002, sold 250,000 copies and reached #2 on the Oricon charts.  Nishikawa also voice acted as [[Miguel Aiman]] early in that series and narrated a recap episode of ''Gundam SEED''.

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Zgmf-1017-miguel.jpg|right|90px|thumb|ZGMF-1017 GINN Miguel Aiman Custom]] -->

''coordinate'', his sixth original album, was released in March 2003.  The cover was a closeup of the customized orange [[GINN#ZGMF-1017 GINN Miguel Aiman Custom|GINN]] that Nishikawa<U+2019>s ''Gundam SEED'' character piloted.  (Orange is Nishikawa<U+2019>s favourite colour.<ref><U+201C>The Color that Represents T.M.Revolution is Orange,<U+201D> ''Winds-Turbo Blog: Trivia'', 14 April 2006, accessed 10 August 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbotrivia/diary/200604140001/>.</ref>)  {{nihongo|<U+201C>Meteor<U+201D>|Meteor -<U+30DF><U+30FC><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30A2>-||}}, an album track from ''coordinate'', was used as an insert song to ''Gundam SEED''.  The album mix of <U+201C>THUNDERBIRD<U+201D>, originally from ''the force'', was also included on this album.  Later that year, Nishikawa became the first artist to be signed under Tofu Records, and ''coordinate'' was the first album released by Tofu.  The Tofu release of ''coordinate'' also included <U+201C>HEART OF SWORD ~''Yoake Mae''~<U+201D> as a [[bonus track]].  Nishikawa made his debut North American performance at Otakon in August 2003, to a massive audience who filled both the ballroom and overflow room (an exhibition hall) of the [[Baltimore Convention Center]] to their entirety.

===''SEVENTH HEAVEN'' era===
Nishikawa released his eighteenth single, {{nihongo|''Albireo''|Albireo -<U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30D3><U+30EC><U+30AA>-|}}, in February 2004.  ([[Albireo]] is a bright star from the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].)  <U+201C>Albireo<U+201D> was used in a music variety show on [[Nippon Television]] called ''AX MUSIC-TV'', where it was #49 on the show<U+2019>s <U+201C>power play<U+201D> list.<ref name="7th"><U+201C>SEVENTH HEAVEN<U+201D>, track list, ''Sony Music Online Japan'', 2004, accessed 13 October 2006 <http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Arch/ES/TMRevolution/ESCL-2679/>.</ref>  ''SEVENTH HEAVEN'', his aptly named seventh album, was released in March 2004.  Tofu Records released ''SEVENTH HEAVEN'' a few weeks later and Nishikawa performed at Pacific Media Expo in May 2004.  <U+201C>Zips<U+201D>, a track from ''SEVENTH HEAVEN'', was used as an insert song for the first ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Special Edition]]'' movie.  <U+201C>Wheel of Fortune<U+201D> was used as a [[Formula Nippon]] theme song on [[Fuji Television]].<ref name="7th" />

===''vertical infinity'' era===
Nishikawa was asked to sing the ending theme song of the Japanese theatrical release of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (<U+201C>Web of Night<U+201D>), because of his performance at PMX 2004 and his relations at Sony Music Japan.  ''Web of Night'', released in late July 2004, also included a rearrangement of <U+201C>Tears Macerate Reason<U+201D> (originally from ''SEVENTH HEAVEN'') and an English version of the song (translated by Lynne Hobday).  Nishikawa shot the <U+201C>Web of Night<U+201D> PV in both languages.  He also attended the world premiere of ''Spider-Man 2'' wearing a traditional Japanese [[kimono]].<ref>Jonathan Mays, <U+201C>Sound Decision: TMR at Spider-Man 2,<U+201D> ''Anime News Network'', 15 July 2004, accessed 7 August 2006 <http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/sound-decision/2004-07-15>.</ref>

{{nihongo|<U+201C>ignited<U+201D>|ignited -<U+30A4><U+30B0><U+30CA><U+30A4><U+30C6><U+30C3><U+30C9>-||}} was used as the first opening song of ''Gundam SEED Destiny'', which premiered in October 2004.  The release of the ''ignited'' single was originally scheduled for October 27, but its release date was pushed back to November 3 for unknown reasons.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  ''ignited'' was the first TMR single to reach #1 on the Oricon charts since 1998, becoming the 900th #1 single in the Oricon chart.  It was #53 on the [[2004 Oricon Top 100 Singles]] chart, having sold 161,324 copies.

Nishikawa also voice acted as [[Heine Westenfluss]] for several episodes of ''Gundam SEED Destiny''.  His character was directly modelled after Nishikawa himself, as opposed to ''SEED''<U+2019>s Miguel Aiman.  Heine<U+2019>s hairstyle resembled Nishikawa<U+2019>s [[Luis-Mary]] hairstyle, and his name was a play on Nishikawa<U+2019>s pseudonym with that band (Haine).  [Heine<U+2019>s first name is written as {{nihongo|Haine|<U+30CF><U+30A4><U+30CD>|}} in [[katakana]].]  The surnames of both Nishikawa and Westenfluss mean <U+201C>west river<U+201D> in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (<U+897F><U+5DDD>) and [[German language|German]] (Westenflu<U+00DF>), respectively.  Interestingly, ''ignited''<U+2019>s title is closely similar to the [[Mobile weapons|mobile suit]] ([[ZGMF-X2000 GOUF Ignited|GOUF Ignited]]) that Nishikawa<U+2019>s ''GSD'' character piloted.

''vertical infinity'' was released on January 26, 2005 by Epic and exactly six months later by Tofu Records.  The infinity symbol (<U+221E>), when facing vertically or turned sideways, looks like the number [[8 (number)|8]].  That is also the number of original studio albums Nishikawa has released to date as T.M.Revolution.  ''vertical infinity'' included album mixes of <U+201C>Web of Night<U+201D> (both Japanese and English versions) and <U+201C>ignited<U+201D>.  It also included two English-language tracks, <U+201C>BRING IT ON<U+201D> (written by Nishikawa) and <U+201C>CHASE / THE THRILL<U+201D> (written by Hobday).  <U+201C>CHASE / THE THRILL<U+201D> was used as the Japanese theme song of the [[X Games]].<ref>Amos Wong, <U+201C>Second Revolution,<U+201D> ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]]'' (US ed.), September 2005, accessed 7 August 2006 <http://community.livejournal.com/tmrevolutionist/56990.html>.</ref>{{Verify source|date=August 2007}} }}  ''vertical infinity'' marked a significant change in T.M.Revolution<U+2019>s musical style, as only half of the album was arranged by Daisuke Asakura, while Nishikawa arranged or co-arranged the other tracks.

===UNDER:COVER era===
With preparations for T.M.Revolution<U+2019>s tenth anniversary in May 2006 and other commitments, Nishikawa was unable to visit North America in 2005.  In April 2005, he began cohosting NHK<U+2019>s music variety show ''Pop Jam'' with [[NHK Broadcasting Center]] announcer {{nihongo|Yuriko Murakami|<U+6751><U+4E0A> <U+7531><U+5229><U+5B50>||}} and comedy duo {{nihongo|UN JASH|<U+30A2><U+30F3><U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30C3><U+30B7><U+30E5>|Anjasshu}}.  Nishikawa<U+2019>s twenty-first single, {{nihongo|''vestige''|vestige -<U+30F4><U+30A7><U+30B9><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30B8>-|}}, was released in August 2005.  It was his fourth single, and second consecutive, to reach #1 on the Oricon charts.  <U+201C>vestige<U+201D> was used as an insert song for ''Gundam SEED Destiny''.  <U+201C>crosswise<U+201D>, the other track, was used as the theme song for [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Sengoku BASARA]]''.  ''vestige'' was #54 on the [[2005 Oricon Top 100 Singles]] chart, with 176,028 copies sold that year.

The ''vestige'' single came with a unique password that was used to vote online (on T.M.Revolution<U+2019>s official website) for which songs would appear on an upcoming self-cover album.  These songs would be rearranged and re-recorded.  Ten songs were originally planned for this album, but due to the overwhelming amount of votes, fifteen tracks were recorded instead.<ref>violetcloud, <U+201C>...........OMG,<U+201D> ''tmrevolutionist'', 25 October 2005, accessed 8 August 2006 <http://community.livejournal.com/tmrevolutionist/66312.html>.</ref>  The <U+201C>self-cover best album<U+201D>, titled ''UNDER:COVER'', was released on January 1, 2006 and was ranked #8 on the Oricon charts.  ''UNDER:COVER'' came in two editions, limited (or first press) and regular.  The regular edition contained fourteen tracks.  The limited edition came with fourteen tracks, a bonus track on a separate disc (instrumental version of <U+201C>Meteor<U+201D>, Daisuke Asakura<U+2019>s only contribution to the album), and a poster (which listed the names of all the people who selected the tracks).  The rearrangement of <U+201C>Zips<U+201D> was used as an insert song to the first ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: Special Edition]]'' movie.

Nishikawa performed the ''UNDER:COVER'' mix of <U+201C>WHITE BREATH<U+201D> at the 56th edition of ''K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen'', his third appearance and his first since 1998.  His cohosting duties on ''Pop Jam'' came to an end in March 2006.  His tenth anniversary celebration was held at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in [[Osaka]] on May 13, 2006.  That day, it was announced that Nishikawa will perform at USJ, near Peter Pan<U+2019>s Neverland, on his 36th birthday on September 19, 2006.<ref><U+201C>On September 19, T.M.Revolution Special Day at Universal Studios Japan,<U+201D> ''Winds-Turbo Blog'', 14 May 2006, accessed 8 August 2006 <http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200605140000/>.</ref>  His second compilation album, ''1000000000000'' (a one followed by 12 zeroes), was released on June 7, 2006.  It was a two disc set that contained the A-sides of all twenty-one singles released to date, and was ranked #1 on the Oricon charts.  The corresponding DVD, released three weeks later, contained all twenty-four TMR PVs made.  Nishikawa has also stared in a drama called ''Nursing <U+00C9>toile'' in autumn 2006.<ref><U+201C>Appearance on Drama in Autumn,<U+201D> Ibid., 10 June 2006, accessed 8 August 2006 He has also shown that T.M. Revolution is still alive, by doing various holiday-themed shows on Japanese pop stations in December 2006.<http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/windsturbo/diary/200606100001/>.</ref>

===Abingdon boys school era===
Nishikawa has done work with his side-band, [[Abingdon Boys School]]. Ex-[[Wands (band)|Wands]] guitarist Hiroshi Shibasaki joined the band. On December 6, 2006, they released a single, entitled "INNOCENT SORROW," and released another single entitled "HOWLING" on May 15, 2007.
