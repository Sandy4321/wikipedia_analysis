Its [[capital (political)|capital]] and [[List of cities in Croatia|largest city]] is [[Zagreb]]. The country is divided into [[Counties of Croatia|20 counties]] and the city of Zagreb. Croatia covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and has diverse, mostly [[Continental climate|continental]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]s. Croatia's [[Adriatic Sea]] coast is long and traced by [[List of islands of Croatia|more than a thousand islands]]. The country's population is 4.29&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Croats]], and the main religion is [[Roman Catholicism]].

In the early 7th century the Croats arrived in area of present-day Croatia. They organised the state into two dukedoms by the 9th century. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925 AD, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of [[Kings of Croatia|Kings]] [[Peter Kre<U+0161>imir IV of Croatia|Peter Kre<U+0161>imir IV]] and [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Dmitar Zvonimir]]. Croatia entered a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian<U+2013>Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]] the [[Parliament on Cetin|Croatian Parliament]] elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg]] to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Croatia was included in the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]] that declared independence from [[Austria<U+2013>Hungary]] and co-founded the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. A [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatian state]] briefly existed during [[World War II]] as a [[fascist]] [[puppet state]]. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Second Yugoslavia]]. In June 1991, Croatia declared [[Statehood Day (Croatia)|independence]], which came into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration.

Since the fall of [[communism]] and the end of the war of independence, Croatia has achieved a high standard of [[List of countries by Human Development Index|human development]] and [[List of countries by income equality|income equality]], and ranks high amongst Central European nations in terms of education, health, quality of life and economic dynamism. The [[International Monetary Fund]] classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the [[World Bank]] identified it as a [[high income economy]]. Croatia is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], [[CEFTA]] and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. Croatia is an [[Acceding countries#Historical enlargements|acceding]] state of the [[European Union]], with [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union#Date of accession|full membership]] expected in July 2013. As an active participant in the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008<U+2013>2009 term.

The [[service sector]] dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the [[industrial sector]] and [[agriculture]]. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a notable source of income during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important [[international trade|trading partner]]. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]]. Internal sources produce a significant portion of [[energy in Croatia]]; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a [[universal health care]] system and free [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], while supporting [[Culture of Croatia|culture]] through numerous public institutions and through corporate investments in [[Media of Croatia|media]] and [[Croatian literature|publishing]]. The nation prides itself in its cultural, [[Croatian art|artistic]] and scientific contributions to the world, as well as in [[Croatian cuisine|its cuisine]], [[Croatian wine|wines]] and [[Sport in Croatia|sporting achievements]].

The [[ethnogenesis]] of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories, ''Slavic'' and ''Iranian'' being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the ''Slavic'' theory, proposes migration of [[White Croats]] from the territory of [[White Croatia]] during the [[Migration Period]].

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories, with the partition formed in 1538. The military territories would become known as the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and were directly controlled by the Austrian emperor. [[Hundred Years' Croatian<U+2013>Ottoman War|Ottoman advance]]s in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and stabilisation of borders. During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1667<U+2013>1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained but western [[Bosnia]], which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.<ref name="frucht422"/> The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. [[Dalmatia]], the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the [[Cretan War (1645<U+2013>1669)|Fifth]] and the [[Ottoman<U+2013>Venetian War (1714<U+2013>1718)|Seventh Ottoman<U+2013>Venetian War]]s.<ref name=Lane409>Lane (1973), p. 409</ref> The [[Croatian<U+2013>Ottoman Wars|Ottoman wars]] instigated great demographic changes.

Between 1797 and 1809 the [[First French Empire]] gradually occupied the entire eastern [[Adriatic]] coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland, ending the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and the [[Ragusan]] republics, establishing the [[Illyrian Provinces]].<ref name="frucht422"/> In response the [[Royal Navy]] started the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807<U+2013>1814|blockade of the Adriatic Sea]] leading to the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Vis]] in 1811.<ref name="Adkins359-362">Adkins, pp. 359<U+2013>362</ref> The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia topo.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Topographic map of Croatia]]
Croatia is located in [[Southeast Europe]] bordering Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in the east, [[Slovenia]] in the west, [[Hungary]] in the north and [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the south. It lies mostly between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42<U+00B0>]] and [[47th parallel north|47<U+00B0> N]] and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13<U+00B0>]] and [[20th meridian east|20<U+00B0> E]]. Part of the territory in the extreme south is separated from the rest of the mainland by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around [[Neum]].<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

The territory covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, consisting of {{convert|56414|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of land and {{convert|128|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of water. It is the 127th largest country largest in the world.<ref name="CIA"/> Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Dinaric Alps]] with the highest point of the [[Dinara]] peak at {{convert|1831|m|ft|abbr=off}} near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south<ref name="CIA"/> to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire south-west border. Insular Croatia consists of over [[List of islands of Croatia|a thousand islands and islets]] varying in size, 48 of which are [[List of inhabited islands of Croatia|permanently inhabited]]. The largest islands are [[Cres]] and [[Krk]],<ref name="CIA"/> each of them having an area of around 405&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The hilly northern parts of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and the flat plains of [[Slavonia]] in the east (which is part of the [[Pannonian Basin]]) are traversed by major rivers such as [[Sava]], [[Drava]], [[Kupa]] and [[Danube]]. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of [[Vukovar]] in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Significant natural resources include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and hydropower.<ref name="CIA"/>

[[Karst topography]] makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geografija.hr/clanci/1011/rasirenost-krsa-u-hrvatskoj|title=Ra<U+0161>irenost kr<U+0161>a u Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Presence of Karst in Croatia|language=Croatian|publisher=Croatian Geographic Society|date=18 December 2006|author=Mate Matas|accessdate=18 October 2011|work=geografija.hr}}</ref> There are 49 caves deeper than {{convert|250|m|2|abbr=on}} in Croatia, with 14 of them deeper than {{convert|500|m|2|abbr=on}} and three deeper than {{convert|1000|m|2|abbr=on}} (the Lukina jama-Trojama, Slovacka jama and Velebita cave systems). Croatia's most famous lakes are the [[Plitvice Lakes National Park|Plitvice lakes]], a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over [[dolomite]] and [[limestone]] cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.<ref name="BBC-Plitvice">{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110617-the-best-national-parks-of-europe|title=The best national parks of Europe|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:2005 1031Image0011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plitvice Lakes National Park]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]]]
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|-3|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on}} (in January) and {{convert|18|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on}} (in July). The coldest parts of the country are [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterized by the [[Mediterranean climate]], as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas<U+2014>the lowest temperature of {{convert|-35.5|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on}} was recorded on 3 February 1919 in [[<U+010C>akovec]], and the highest temperature of {{convert|42.4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=on}} was recorded on 5 July 1950 in [[Karlovac]].<ref name="DZS-Stat2010">{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]]|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2010/SLJH2010.pdf|format= PDF|title=2010 <U+2013> Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia|month=December|year=2010|accessdate= 7 October 2011}}</ref>

Mean annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off}} and {{convert|3500|mm|in|abbr=off}} depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, [[Lastovo]], [[Bi<U+0161>evo]], [[Svetac]]) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia, however in the latter case, it is mostly occurring during the [[growing season]]. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar. Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as [[Bora (wind)|bura]] or less frequently as [[sirocco]]. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and [[Kor<U+010D>ula]], where more than 2700&nbsp;hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2000&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

===Biodiversity===

[[File:Kopacki rit2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kopa<U+010D>ki Rit]] nature park, one of the largest [[wetlands]] in Europe]]
Croatia can be subdivided between a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia<U+2014>Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are [[karst]] habitats which include submerged karst, such as [[Zrmanja]] and [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave [[vertebrate]]<U+2014>the [[olm]]. Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover {{convert|2490000|ha|abbr=off}} representing 44% of Croatian land surface. The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity">{{cite book|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection, [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|format=PDF|url=http://www.vukovarsko-srijemska-zupanija.com/upload/paragrafi_upload/2011-3-21_58011335_BiodiversityofCroatia.pdf|title=Biodiversity of Croatia|year= 2006|editor1=Jasminka Radovi<U+0107>|editor2=Kristijan <U+010C>ivi<U+0107>|editor3= Ramona Topi<U+0107>|isbn=9537169200|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> In terms of [[phytogeography]], Croatia is a part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]].

There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of [[invertebrate]]s discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s alone.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> The most serious threat to them is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by appearance of invasive alien species, especially [[Caulerpa taxifolia]] algae. The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the [[Benthic zone|benthic habitat]]. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

There are 444 [[protected areas of Croatia]], encompassing 9% of the country. Those include 8 [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks in Croatia]], 2 strict reserves and 10 [[nature park]]s. The most famous protected area and the oldest [[national park]] in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]]. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the [[Natura 2000]] network.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

[[Military of Croatia|Croatian Armed Forces]] (CAF) consist of the [[Croatian Army|Army]], [[Croatian Navy|Navy]] and [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Air Force]] branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia|General Staff]], which reports to the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Defence Minister]], who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff.<ref name="CAFstructure">{{cite web|url=http://www.osrh.hr/data/about_en.asp|title=Chain of Command in the CAF|publisher=Croatian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=9 September 2011}}</ref>

[[Privatization]] and the drive toward a [[market economy]] had barely begun under the new Croatian Government when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the war, the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the revenue-rich tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%.

[[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2011 was estimated at 6.61&nbsp;billion Euros. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Vjesnik|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=D37B6CB1-C728-44FE-94C7-8C80B4EA582F|language=Croatian|title=Iako <U+010D>ini gotovo petinu BDP-a, i dalje niskoprofitabilna grana doma<U+0107>e privrede|trans_title=Even though it comprises nearly a fifth of the GDP, it is still a low-profit branch of the national economy|author1=Tomislav Pili|author2=Davor Verkovi<U+0107>|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref> Since the conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 10&nbsp;million tourists each year.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/> The most numerous are tourists from [[Germany]], Slovenia, Austria and the [[Czech Republic]] as well as Croatia itself.

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast. [[Opatija]] was the first holiday resort since the middle of the 19th century.

Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] urban planning took place, for instance in Vara<U+017E>din and Karlovac.<ref name="Vara<U+017E>din-CTB-Baroque">{{cite web|publisher=[[Vara<U+017E>din County]] Tourist Board|url=http://www.turizam-vzz.hr/en/posjetite/varazdin/|title=Vara<U+017E>din <U+2013> Baroque Capital of Croatia|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="JL-Karlovac-Baroque">{{cite news|newspaper=Jutarnji list|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/najljepsi-gradovi-sjeverne-hrvatske---karlovac--ozalj--ogulin/877654/| title= Najljep<U+0161>i gradovi Sjeverne Hrvatske <U+2013> Karlovac, Ozalj, Ogulin|trans_title=The Most Beautiful Cities of the Northern Croatia <U+2013> Karlovac, Ozalj, Ogulin|language=Croatian|date=14 August 2010|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> Subsequent influence of the [[Art Nouveau]] was reflected in contemporary architecture.<ref name="IPU-Art-Nouveau">{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Instituta za povijest umjetnosti|issn=0350<U+2013>3437| publisher=Institute of Art History (Croatia)|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.hart.hr/uploads/documents/354.pdf|author=Dar<U+00AD>ja Rado<U+00AD>vi<U+0107> Mahe<U+00AD><U+010D>i<U+0107>|title=Sek<U+00AD>ven<U+00AD>ca se<U+00AD>ce<U+00AD>sije <U+2013> ar<U+00AD>hite<U+00AD>kt Lav Kal<U+00AD>da|trans_title=Sequence of the Art Nouveau <U+2013> Architect Lav Kalda|year=2006|volume=30|pages= 241<U+2013>264|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong influence of [[renaissance architecture]] in major urban areas exemplified in works of [[Giorgio da Sebenico|Juraj Dalmatinac]] and [[Nikola Firentinac]].

Besides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia, there is a long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the [[Trogir Cathedral]] was made by [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]], representing the most important monument of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] sculpture in the Balkans. The [[Renaissance in Croatia|Renaissance]] had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the [[Hundred Years' Croatian<U+2013>Ottoman War]]. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]]. The nineteenth and the twentieth centuries brought about affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts, most notable being bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]].<ref name="Essehist-Strossmayer">{{cite journal|journal=Essehist|publisher=[[University of Osijek]] <U+2013> Faculty of Philosophy|issn=1847-6236|year=2011|month=September|volume=2|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=95675|title=Josip Juraj Strossmayer <U+2013> Ro<U+0111>eni Osje<U+010D>anin|trans_title=Josip Juraj Strossmayer <U+2013> Native of Osijek|language=Croatian|pages=70<U+2013>73|author=Pavao Nuji<U+0107>|accessdate=10 October 2011}}</ref> Croatian artists of the period achieving worldwide renown were [[Vlaho Bukovac]] and [[Ivan Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107>]].<ref name="MVPEI-Art"/>

Croatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. The coastal regions draw upon culinary influences of Greek, Roman and other [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, as well as condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]] and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] culinary styles. In that area, meats, freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant.<ref name="HTZ-cuisine">{{cite web|publisher=Croatian National Tourist Board|url=http://croatia.hr/en-GB/Discover-Croatia/Gastronomy-and-enology|accessdate=13 October 2011|title=Gastronomy and enology}}</ref>

There are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental region in the north-east of the country, especially Slavonia is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm.<ref name="HTZ-cuisine"/> Annual production of wine exceeds 140&nbsp;million litres.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/> Although beer arrived in the country relatively late in the 18th century,<ref name="skenderovic">{{cite news|url=http://www.matica.hr/HRRevija/revija032.nsf/AllWebDocs/skenderovic|title=Kako je pivo do<U+0161>lo u Hrvatsku|last=Skenderovi<U+0107>|first=Robert|year=2002|work=[[Hrvatska revija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> the annual consumption per capita was 83.3&nbsp;litres in 2008 which placed Croatia 15th among the world's countries.<ref name="kirin">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirinholdings.co.jp/english/news/2009/1221_01.html|title=2008 Per-Capita Beer Consumption by Country|date=21 December 2009|work=Kirin Institute of Food and Lifestyle Report Vol. 22|publisher=[[Kirin Brewery Company]]|accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref>
