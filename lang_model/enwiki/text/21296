The '''Valens Aqueduct''' ({{lang-tr|Bozdo<U+011F>an Kemeri}}, meaning "Aqueduct of the grey falcon"; {{lang-gr|<U+0386><U+03B3><U+03C9><U+03B3><U+03CC><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+1F54><U+03B4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>, ''Ag<U+014D>g<U+00F3>s tou h<U+00FD>datos''}}, meaning simply "[[aqueduct]]") was the major water-providing system of medieval [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]], in [[Turkey]]). Restored by several [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]]s, it is one of the most important landmarks of the city.
 
==Location==
The aqueduct stands in Istanbul, in the quarter of [[Fatih]], and spans the valley between the hills occupied today by the [[Istanbul University]] and the [[Fatih Mosque|Mosque of Fatih]]. The surviving section is 921 meters long, about 50 meters less than the original length.<ref name=ma196>Mamboury, 196</ref> The ''Atat<U+00FC>rk Bulvar<U+0131>'' highway passes under its arches.

==History==
===Byzantine period===
[[Image:AqueductOfValensInVefa20070407 01.jpg|right|200px|thumb|An arch of the eastern section of the Aqueduct in [[Vefa]]. Behind it lies the [[Kalenderhane Mosque|Mosque of Kalenderhane]], which was built on a [[Roman bath]] that was supplied by the aqueduct.]]
The construction of a water supply system for the city (then still called [[Byzantium]]) had begun already under Emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref>Evans, p. 30</ref> Under [[Constantine I]], when the city was rebuilt and increased in size, the system needed to be greatly expanded to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population.<ref name=ma193>Mamboury, 193</ref>

The Valens aqueduct, which originally got its water from the slopes of the hills between [[Ka<U+011F><U+0131>thane]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]],<ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref> was merely one of the terminal points of this new wide system of aqueducts and canals - which eventually reached over 250 km in total length, the longest such system of Antiquity - that stretched throughout the hill-country of [[Thrace]] and provided the capital with water. Once in the city, the water was stored in three open  reservoirs and over a hundred underground [[cistern]]s, such as the [[Basilica Cistern]], with a total capacity of over 1 million cubic meters.<ref>Evans, p.31</ref>

The exact date that construction on the aqueduct began is uncertain, but it was completed in the year 368 during the reign of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Valens]], whose name it bears. It lay along the valley between the third and fourth hills of [[Constantinople]], occupied respectively at that time by the [[Capitolium of Constantinople|Capitolium]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> According to tradition, the aqueduct was built using the stones of the walls of [[Chalcedon]], pulled down as punishment in 366 after the [[Valens#Revolt of Procopius|revolt]] of [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]].<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> The structure was inaugurated in the year 373 by the [[Praefectus urbis|urban prefect]] Klearchos, who commissioned a ''[[Nymphaeum]] Maius'' in the [[Forum of Theodosius]], that was supplied with water from the aqueduct.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref>{{cref|a}}

After a severe drought in 382, [[Theodosius I]] built a new line (the ''Aquaeductus Theodosiacus''), which got water from the northeastern region known today as Belgrade Forest.<ref name=ma193>Mamboury, 193</ref> Other works were executed under [[Theodosius II]], who decided to distribute the water of the aqueduct exclusively to the Nymphaeum, the [[Baths of Zeuxippus|Baths]] and the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]].<ref name=ma193>Mamboury, 193</ref> The aqueduct, possibly damaged by an earthquake, was restored under [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], who connected it with the Cistern of the [[Basilica]] of [[Illus]]{{cref|b}} (identified today either with the ''[[Basilica Cistern|Yerebatan]]'' or with the ''Binbirdirek'' ([[Turkish Language|Turkish]]: "thousand and one columns") cistern, and was finally repaired in 576 by [[Justin II]], who built a separated pipe.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> <ref name=ma194>Mamboury, 194</ref>

The aqueduct was cut by the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege of 626]], and the water supply was reestablished only after the great drought of 758 by Emperor [[Constantine V]].<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> The Emperor had the whole water supply system repaired by a certain Patrikios, who used a large labour force coming from the whole of Greece and Anatolia.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref>

Other maintenance works were accomplished under Emperors [[Basil II]] (in 1019) and [[Romanos III Argyros]].<ref name=mw274>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 274</ref> <ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref>

The last Byzantine Emperor who took care of the aqueduct was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]].<ref name=ma194>Mamboury, 194</ref> Neither during the [[Latin Empire]] nor during the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] age were any repair works executed, but by that time the population of the city had shrunk to about 40,000 - 50,000 inhabitants, so that the water supply was not a very important issue anymore.<ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref> Nevertheless, according to [[Ruy Gonz<U+00E1>les de Clavijo]], a [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] diplomat who traveled to Constantinople en route to an embassy to [[Timur]] in 1403, the aqueduct was still functioning.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref>

===Ottoman period===
[[Image:Aqueduct of Valens in Istanbul.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Aqueduct of Valens today]]
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453), Sultan [[Mehmet II]] repaired the whole water supply, which was then used to bring water to the imperial palaces of ''Eski Sarayi'' (the first palace, built on the third hill) and [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace|Topkap<U+0131> Sarayi]], and connected it with a new line coming from the northeast. The great earthquake of 1509 destroyed the arches near the [[<U+015E>ehzade Mosque|Mosque of <U+015E>ehzade]], which was erected some time later. This gave rise to the hypothesis that they were cut, in order to allow a better view from the nearby mosque. The repairs to the water-supplying net continued under [[Beyazid II]], who added a new line.<ref name=mw274>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 274</ref>

Around the middle of the 16th century, [[Suleyman I]] rebuilt the arches (now [[Ogive#Architecture|ogival]]) 47 up to 51 (counted from the west) near the Mosque of <U+015E>ehzade, and commissioned the Architect [[Sinan]] to add two more lines, coming from the Forest of Belgrade (''Belgrat Ormanl<U+0131>'').<ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref> The increased flow allowed the distribution of water to the ''K<U+03B9>rk<U+00E7>e<U+015F>me'' ("Forty fountains") quarter, situated along the aqueduct on the [[Golden Horn]] side, and so called after the many fountains built there under Suleyman.<ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref>

Under Sultan [[Mustafa II]], five arches (41-45) were restored, respecting the ancient form. An inscription ''in situ'', dated 1696/97, commemorates the event.<ref name=mw274>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 274</ref> His successor [[Ahmed III]] repaired again the distribution net.<ref name=mw274>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 274</ref>

In 1912, a 50-meter-long part of the aqueduct near the Mosque of Fatih was pulled down.<ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref> In the same period, a ''Taksim'' ("distribution plant", ''lit.'' [[Taksim Square#History|'division']]) at the east end was erected. <ref name=ma202>Mamboury, 202</ref>

==Description==
The Aqueduct of Valens had a length of 971 m and a maximum height of ca. 29 m (63 m above sea level) with a constant slope of 1:1000.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> Arches 1-40 and 46-51 belong to the time of Valens, arches 41-45 to Mustafa II, and those between 52 and 56 to Suleyman I.<ref name= ey78>Eyice, 78</ref> Arches 18-73 have a double order, the others a single order.<ref name=ey78>Eyice, 78</ref><ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> 

Originally the structure ran perfectly straight, but during the construction of the [[Fatih Mosque|Mosque of Fatih]] - for unknown reasons - it was bent in that section.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref> The [[masonry]] is not regular, and uses [[ashlar]] blocks and bricks.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> The first row of arches is built with well-squared stone blocks, the upper row is built with four to seven courses of stones alternated with a bed of smaller material (''[[Cement|opus caementitium]]'') clamped with iron [[Clamp (tool)|cramps]].<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref> The width of the aqueduct varies  from 7.75 m to 8.24 m.<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener, 273</ref> The pillars are 3.70 m thick, and the arches of the lower order are four meters wide.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref>

The water comes from two lines from the northeast and one coming from the northwest, which join together outside the walls, near the [[Walls of Constantinople#The Gates|Adrianople Gate (Edirne Kap<U+0131>)]].<ref name=ma196>Mamboury, 196</ref> Near the east end of the aqueduct there is a distribution plant, and another lies near [[Hagia Sophia]]. The water feeds the zone of the imperial palace.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref> The daily discharge in the 1950s amounted to 6,120 cubic meters.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref> During Byzantine times, two roads important for the topography of medieval Constantinople crossed under the eastern section of the aqueduct.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury, 203</ref>
