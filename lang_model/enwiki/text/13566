'''Rehoboth Beach''' is a city in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], [[Delaware]], [[United States]]. According to 2006 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city is 1,556.<ref name=popest2>{{cite web | year = [[June 21]] [[2006]] | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2005-04-10.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population for All Incorporated Places in Delaware | format = [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] | work = 2005 Population Estimates | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division | accessdate = November 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>  A popular regional vacation destination, Rehoboth Beach's seasonal population expands to over 75,000 in the summer.

==History==
The city was founded in 1873 as the '''Rehoboth Beach Camp Meeting Association''' by the Rev. Robert W. Todd, of St. Paul's [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], as a site for [[Methodist]] [[camp meeting]]s in the spirit of similar resorts on the [[New Jersey]] shore, such as [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey|Ocean Grove]].  The Camp Meeting Association disbanded in 1881, and in 1891, the location was incorporated by the [[Delaware]] General Assembly as "Henlopen City", shortly after which it was renamed to Rehoboth Beach.

'''[[Rehoboth (Bible)|Rehoboth]]''' is a name of Biblical appellation, meaning "place [or space] for all". 
also named after Rehovot, a city in Israel (In modern Hebrew, the same means 'streets').  The name is strikingly fitting, due to Rehoboth Beach's ability to blend its distinct communities.  Rehoboth appears four times in the [[Old Testament]] as, variously, a well dug by [[Isaac]] (Wadi er-Ruheibeh) (Gen. 26:22), a city on the [[Euphrates River]] (Gen. 36:37; 1 Chr. 1:48), and one of the cities of [[Asshur]] (Gen. 10:11). Consequently, the name had obvious appeal to the religious founders of the city.

==Modern resort town==
The town often bills itself as "The Nation's Summer Capital" due to the fact that it is a frequent summer vacation destination for [[Washington, D.C.]], residents as well as visitors from [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and in lesser numbers, [[Pennsylvania]].  Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, and nightlife.  

Still famous for its beaches, wooden boardwalk, eclectic shops, amusements, and sporting activities, today's Rehoboth Beach is also known as one of the mid-Atlantic coast's popular [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] getaways because of the large number of gay-owned and operated businesses and because of the gay-frequented stretch of beach near Queen Street, known as Poodle Beach. <ref>http://www.funmaps.com/index.cgi/nextState=DestinationDisplay/where:geographicalLocation=27</ref><ref>http://www.gay.com/travel/premium/?sernum=291</ref>

Rehoboth Beach serves as an alternative to nearby and much more developed [[Ocean City, Maryland]].  Rehoboth Beach, together with the towns of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]], [[South Bethany, Delaware|South Bethany]], and [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]], comprises Delaware's beach resorts and is [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]'s most densely populated and fastest-growing area.

[[Reader's Digest]] named the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk as "Best of America". This celebration of the quirky, amazing and truly extraordinary was featured in the May 2006 issue.{{NCite|date=September 2007}} Additionally, [[AARP]] has named Rehoboth Beach as one of five dream towns as "Best Places to Retire". <ref>http://www.retirementindelaware.com/pdf/AARPDreamTowns.pdf</ref>

The town has several festivals including the [[Sea Witch Festival]], the [[Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival]], and the [[Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival]] every year.
