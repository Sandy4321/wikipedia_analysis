'''Brittany Ferries''' is a French [[ferry]] company that runs ships between [[France]] and [[England]], France and [[Ireland]], France and [[Spain]], and England and Spain. 

==History==

===1970s and 1980s===
[[File:Brittany ferries route map home-page 260x336.jpg|right|thumb|Brittany Ferries routes]]

In January 1973, following the provision of the deep-water [[Port of Bloscon-Roscoff|port at Roscoff]], the company commenced operations at the instigation of [[Alexis Gourvennec]], when the existing ferry companies showed reluctance about providing a service from Roscoff to Plymouth. The company began sailings between [[Roscoff]] in [[Brittany]] and [[Plymouth]] in the South West of England, using the freight ferry ''Kerisnel''. The company's primary aim at that time was to provide a service to Brittany's [[cauliflower]] and [[artichoke]] farmers, giving them easier access to the British market. In the summer of 1973, Vedettes Armoricaines operated a service between Plymouth and Roscoff using the passenger only ferry ''Poseidon'' which they had acquired from [[Stena Line]], and Brittany Ferries acted as the agents in the United Kingdom for this service.<ref>''Cruising Monthly'', newsletter of Coastal Cruising Association, and other contemporary journals, 1973</ref>  In 1974 ''Kerisnel'' was replaced by ''Penn-Ar-Bed'', which carried both passengers and vehicles.  Such was the success of the Plymouth-Roscoff service that a larger ship, the ''Cornouailles'', was ordered and entered service in 1977. New routes were developed in the late 1970s, and the company continued to grow. Routes to [[Saint-Malo]], [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in Ireland were operated by the ''Armorique'' and the ''Prince of Brittany'', and in the early 1980s a second ship was chartered for the Saint-Malo route. The ''[[MV Wickersham|Goelo]]'', an attractive-looking vessel, left the fleet in preparation for the new ship to be introduced in 1982.  The ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'' replaced the ''Armorique'' for the Santander and Cork services, allowing her to operate alongside the ''Prince of Brittany'' on the Saint-Malo route, while the ''Cornouailles'' maintained the original routes from Roscoff.

The ''Benodet'' operated between Plymouth and Roscoff for just one year before being redeployed as part of Brittany Ferries' new venture, [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]].  The ''Tregastel'' replaced her and continued on the Plymouth to Roscoff route until 1989.  The Cork route was operated by ''Tregastel'' and ''Quiberon'', later to be joined by ''Celtic Pride'', operated by Swansea Cork Ferries, supplying a midweek Cork-Roscoff round trip.

In 1985 Brittany Ferries further expanded by buying Truckline Ferries, which operated freight-only ships  ''[[MV Coutances|Coutances]]'' and ''Purbeck'' between [[Poole]] in England and [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in France.

In 1986, Brittany Ferries introduced the ''[[MV Duc de Normandie|Duc de Normandie]]'', which operated a new route from Caen to the increasingly popular port of Portsmouth.  The former Roscoff ship ''Cornouailles'' was transferred to the Truckline Ferries route from Poole to Cherbourg, introducing passenger services on this route.  This service was also very successful, and new ships were introduced over the next few years.  Meanwhile, a second (chartered) ship, the ''Gotland'' was installed on the Caen service in 1988, as well as a new Truckline Ferries vessel, the {{MV|Normandie Shipper||2}} in 1989. In addition to the Portsmouth-Caen services, from 1986 a Truckline Ferries ferry ran from Poole to Caen during the summer to cope with the seasonal demand on Brittany's standard ships by holiday makers. However, the introduction of larger ships in 2006, and the sale of the original "truckliners", meant that this service was discontinued.

In 1989 the cruise ferry ''[[MV Bretagne|Bretagne]]'' was introduced on the Santander and Cork routes.  She displaced the ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'', which transferred to the Roscoff route.  ''Tregastel'' replaced ''Cornouailles'' on the Poole-Cherbourg Truckline Ferries passenger route along with ''Corbiere'' (formerly the ''Benodet'' who had been transferred to [[British Channel Island Ferries|Channel Island Ferries]]).  ''Cornouailles'' was sold to British Channel Island Ferries and was renamed ''Havelet''.  A second-hand purchase was introduced on the St Malo route, the ''Duchesse Anne''. which was to run alongside the ''Armorique''.  This allowed the ''Prince of Brittany'' to be transferred to the Caen route under its new name the ''Reine Mathilde''.

===1990s===
At the end of 1991, the ''Reine Mathilde'' left the fleet ready for the introduction of the new cruise ferry the ''Normandie'' on the Caen route.  The ''Corbiere'' and ''Tregastel'' also stepped down in preparation for the new Truckline Ferries ship, the ''Barfleur''.  During 1992, the Truckline Ferries freight vessel, ''Purbeck'', and the St Malo ship ''Armorique'' both stepped down.

In 1993, the final new ship of the 1990s was introduced.  The [[MV Val de Loire|''Val de Loire'']] was purchased from [[TT-Line]] and partially rebuilt for service on the [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and Cork routes.  The vessel replaced the ''Bretagne'' which transferred to the St Malo route, allowing the ''Duchesse Anne'' to operate new services between Poole, St Malo, Cork, Roscoff and Plymouth.  Following further financial difficulties in the mid-1990s, these new routes were ended and the ''Duchesse Anne'' left the fleet.  The ''Normandie Shipper'' was also sold, but the ex-Truckline Ferries vessel ''Purbeck'' was later chartered back by the company for use on various routes, primarily Portsmouth-Caen.  In 1999, the ''Barfleur'' was repainted in Brittany Ferries colours, ending the Truckline Ferries tradition on the route.

===2000s===
In 2001 a new fast ferry service began to operate between Poole and Cherbourg in partnership with [[Condor Ferries]].  The fast ''Normandie Vitesse'' could make the voyage in just over two hours.  In 2002, a new ship, the ''Mont St Michel'', was due to enter service between Portsmouth and Caen.  The ''[[MV Duc de Normandie|Duc de Normandie]]'' was transferred to the Roscoff route in July, whilst the ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'' was sent to Caen to cover until the new ship arrived.  The ''Mont St Michel'' was delayed until December however.  The ''[[MV Quiberon|Quiberon]]'' spent the remainder of the year on the busiest Brittany Ferries route.  She had been with the company for almost 21 years when she was sold in 2003.  In 2004, another new ship, the ''Pont-Aven'', was introduced on the Santander & Cork routes.  She could travel much faster than the rest of the fleet, cutting journey times by a quarter.  This allowed the ''Val de Loire'' to join the ''Bretagne'' on the St Malo route.  Both ships also provided a new mid-week link to Cherbourg from Portsmouth.

In late 2004, the company withdrew the ''[[MV Duc de Normandie|Duc de Normandie]]'' from the fleet.  The ''Bretagne'' transferred to the Roscoff route, leaving the ''Val de Loire'' at St Malo.  The ''Coutances'' was also earmarked for disposal, but then a change of heart resulted in its refit, losing her Truckline Ferries livery in favour of the new Brittany Ferries logo.

More changes occurred in 2005 with the withdrawal of [[P&O Ferries|P&O]]'s French routes from Portsmouth.  A new fastcraft, the ''Normandie Express'' was chartered to operate between Portsmouth and Cherbourg and Caen.  In addition, the Poole-Cherbourg ship ''Barfleur'' was redeployed to operate a triangular service between Portsmouth, Poole and Cherbourg.  A new ship was announced, in part a replacement for the ''Coutances''. The ship was named the ''Cotentin''. ''Purbeck'' was to have returned from operating in New Zealand and cover the Portsmouth-Cherbourg link but this plan was dropped. ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg link in November 2005.

The former flagship of the fleet (from 1993 until the arrival of the ''Mont St Michel'') ''Val de Loire'' left the fleet in February 2006, having been sold to [[DFDS]] and renamed ''King of Scandinavia''. In the meantime, Brittany Ferries had taken a 2 year charter of the DFDS ship ''Duke of Scandinavia'', which was renamed ''Pont-L'Abb<U+00E9>'' and ran on the Plymouth-Roscoff route.  The ''Bretagne'' returned to the Portsmouth-St Malo route. Brittany Ferries also announced a new build for the Plymouth-Roscoff route, to be launched early 2008.  In February 2006 the ''Normandie Express'' was brought under the French flag, she was later purchased by the company in early 2007.  Brittany Ferries new freight ship, the ''Cotentin'', entered service on 26 November 2007 with the 23:45 Cherbourg-Poole service.  The new ship also operated a weekly service to Santander from Poole. It was announced on 19 December 2007 that the company had purchased the ''Pont-L'Abb<U+00E9>'' from DFDS. On 1 May 2008 MV Coutances completed her last sailing for the company - having been with Truckline Ferries] for 30 years and with Brittany Ferries since 1985.  In early 2009, the ''[[MV Armorique|Armorique]]'' was launched on the Plymouth-Roscoff route, replacing the ''Pont L'Abbe''. For 2009, the ''Pont-Aven'' operated a new Portsmouth to Santander service once a week (cutting the previous Plymouth to Santander route to once a week).

===2010s===
In late 2009, the new Poole-Santander freight-only service was deemed a success and the frequency was doubled: there would now be two services a week operated by ''Cotentin''. In November 2009, the ''[[MV Armorique|Armorique]]'' was laid up for the rest of the Winter season. Major changes were announced in December 2009. The ''Barfleur'' was withdrawn from service at the end of January 2010 after nearly 18 years service on the Poole-Cherbourg route. The service was temporarily serviced by the ''Armorique'' which came back to service earlier than originally planned. The Poole-Santander service reverted to one sailing a week with the ''Cotentin'' covering freight on the Poole-Cherbourg service in the absence of ''Barfleur''. The ''Condor Vitesse'' continued to operate one round sailing a day in the summer months between the two ports. The ''Cap Finist<U+00E8>re'' ran between Portsmouth and Santander twice a week and also operated three round trips a week between Portsmouth and Cherbourg. In September 2010, Brittany Ferries announced plans to serve the [[Portsmouth]]-[[Bilbao]] route recently abandoned by [[P&O Ferries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldaily.co.uk/AsiaPacificNews/Detail.aspx?Section=20510|title=Brittany Ferries saves Portsmouth-Bilbao route|work=Travel News UK|date=September 27, 2010|accessdate=October 8, 2010 
}}</ref> The route started on 27 March 2011.

In February 2011, ''Barfleur'' returned to the Poole-Cherbourg route on a seven-month trial basis after being laid up for a year. Her final crossing of 2011 was 3 October. The return of ''Barfleur'' allowed ''Cotentin'' to run two Poole-Santander trips a week. However, with ''Barfleur'' being laid up again, the Poole-Santander sailings reverted to one trip a week. On 23 March, it was announced that ''Barfleur'' was to be chartered to [[DFDS Seaways]] for use on their [[Dover]]-[[Calais]] route. Her first sailing on the route was on 27 April.

On 1 April 2011, the new [[Portsmouth International Port]] (PIP) terminal, used by Brittany Ferries, [[LD Lines]] and [[Condor Ferries]], was opened to the public. An official opening ceremony took place on 13 May 2011. This modern, stylish, eco-friendly building replaced the previous terminal building that stood from 1976 until its well needed replacement occurred in 2011.

On 21 September 2012, Brittany Ferries cancelled sailings indefinitely following two days of wildcat strikes caused by crew members who were unhappy with changes in working terms and conditions. Meetings took place between management and unions to negotiate the management proposals. A vote was taken on 30 September by union members to decide if the management proposals would be accepted. The crew members accepted the proposal and services resumed on 2 October after 12 days without services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.bfenthusiasts.com/showthread.php?t=11155|title=BF industrial dispute September 2012 - the aftermath|work=BFEnthusiasts|date=2 October 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> During this period, Brittany Ferries made special arrangements with [[P&O Ferries]] and [[MyFerryLink]] to accept Brittany Ferries tickets on the [[Dover]]-[[Calais]] route, any unused tickets were refunded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19671784|title=Brittany Ferries services halted 'until further notice'|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref> Services were not affected on the [[Poole]]-[[Cherbourg]] route which was being operated by [[Condor Ferries]].

The 2012 season was the last year of the Poole-Cherbourg fastcraft operation with [[Condor Ferries]]. For the first time since 2001, the Condor vessel operating the Poole-Cherbourg summer service was the ''Condor Express'' rather than the ''Condor Vitesse''.

In May 2013, Brittany Ferries introduced a new route with services from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Le Havre]] using their high-speed vessel, ''Normandie Express''.

In October 2013, Brittany Ferries<U+2019> freight service from Poole-Santander terminated and [[MV Cotentin|Cotentin]], who served the route, is now being chartered by Stena Line.

On 5 November 2013, Christophe Mathieu, Deputy Managing Director of Brittany Ferries and Sandie Dawe, Chief Executive of [[VisitBritain]] signed an agreement to run a joint marketing campaign designed to attract more French tourists to the UK. The agreement commits both parties to a three-year campaign with a promotional match-funded spend of <U+00A3>1.5 million, and is the first time Brittany Ferries has entered into such an arrangement with VisitBritain.

It was announced on the 14 January 2014 that the company has ordered a <U+00A3>225 million (270 million euros) Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) powered cruise-ferry, which will be built by STX France in St Nazaire. This vessel is to be put into service late spring 2017 and is the first ferry from the UK to use LNG fuel- a colourless, odourless gas which emits around 25% less carbon dioxide during combustion than oil and is sulphur-free.

On Friday 7 February 2014, Brittany Ferries announced that as from the end of March the former Visentini-built [[DFDS Seaways]] [[Norman Voyager]] will operate on [[Le Havre]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Santander, Spain|Santander]].

During the weekends the ferry will sail on [[Portsmouth]] <U+2013> [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. Demand for freight capacity is high during the weekend, but also passengers are interested in such a service.

On weekdays the [[Norman Voyager]], which has been renamed 'Etretat', will sail on [[Portsmouth]] <U+2013> [[Le Havre]], a route that was successful last year when Brittany Ferries introduced the catamaran [[HSC Normandie Express]]. The latter will again sail on [[Portsmouth]] - [[Le Havre]] during the high season of 2014. The <U+201C>new<U+201D> ro-pax ferry will sail year-round.

==Future fleet==

In March 2011, Brittany Ferries and shipbuilder [[STX Europe]] announced that they were embarking on a new joint study project to develop a new generation of passenger ferries. Powered by dual-engine fuels, the new ships will burn liquefied natural gas ([[LNG]]) in combination with a high efficiency electric propulsion system, reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 15-20% compared with the current fleet.

On 14 January 2014, Brittany Ferries officially announced that they have ordered the new Gas-Powered Cruise Ferry with [[STX Europe]] in [[St Nazaire]], [[France]] contracted to build the vessel.

Brittany Ferries and STX France have been co-operating for two years on a study regarding the feasibility of powering a Cruise-Ferry by [[LNG]]. The ship, costing some 270 million euros (<U+00A3>225 million) will be built by STX France in [[St. Nazaire]] and she will enter service in late spring 2017.

This new ship will replace Brittany Ferries' current flagship, [[MV Pont-Aven]], which will move to the [[Portsmouth]]-[[St Malo]] route. It is rumoured that [[MV Bretagne]] will leave the fleet in 2017, although this has not been confirmed by the company.

Operating on the longer routes between [[UK]] and [[Spain]], she will have many of [[MV Pont-Aven]]'s features, such as an indoor swimming pool, two cinemas, restaurants, pet kennels, and so on. In addition, she will have 30 pet-friendly cabins which have proved so popular on the Company's other ship to Spain, [[MV Cap Finist<U+00E8>re]], as well as a quiet reading lounge, an observation area,  and a sophisticated spa treatment room with panoramic views. The latest technology will be applied and free [[Wi-Fi]] will be available in every cabin and throughout the ship.

On board, there will be 675 cabins, including 12 Commodore Suites, 51 Deluxe cabins, 30 pet-friendly cabins and 15 wheelchair-accessible cabins.

:Brittany Ferries began operating on this route in 2004 using the ''[[MV Bretagne|Bretagne]]'' and ''[[MS King of Scandinavia|Val de Loire]]'' in direct competition with the [[P&O Ferries]] service.  Following P&O's withdrawal from the route Brittany Ferries introduced the ''Normandie Express'' to operate during the summer season with a conventional service for the rest of the year.  The route became a seasonal service after the end of the 2006 summer season with the service recommencing on 23 March 2007 and closing again on 29 October 2007. A limited conventional service for freight was provided by the ''Coutances'' to reposition the ship from Portsmouth to Poole once a week between the end of November 2007 and 1 May 2008. Regular passenger services resumed in Summer 2008 and Summer 2009.

*[[Plymouth]]-[[St Malo]] ('''''Armorique, Bretagne''''')
In the winter, during refit season, this route is used so that both ''[[MV Armorique]]'' and ''[[MV Bretagne]]'' can be moved between the [[Portsmouth]] to [[St Malo]] route and also the [[Plymouth]] to [[Roscoff]] route.

*[[HSC Normandie Express]] operates a more seasonal service between [[Portsmouth International Port]] and [[Le Havre]], generally operating between May and October.

===Exceptional services===
During the 'refit season' (roughly early January until before the Easter break), many ships undergo major maintenance and refurbishment.  It is not uncommon to, as a positioning move, operate a service from Plymouth - St Malo - Portsmouth, or vice-versa.  These services are generally noted in the printed and on-line timetables, and are open to passengers.

==Onboard facilities==
Brittany Ferries' vessels have a variety of onboard facilities.  These include shops, self-service and [[A la carte]] restaurants, bars and cafes.  All vessels have their own [[bureau de change]], except for the [[MV Cap Finist<U+00E8>re|Cap Finist<U+00E8>re]] and the [[MV Armorique|Armorique]] which, alternately, provide an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] that dispenses [[Euros]].  Most vessels have a [[Movie theater|cinema]] and [[gambling]]/[[Arcade game|gaming machines]].  In the past, the on-board shops often included a [[photography]] shop with film developing and printing facilities; however, the increase in popularity of [[digital photography]] has led to these shops being removed. In late 2009 Brittany Ferries installed a WiFi service across its fleet of traditional ferries and in April 2013 free Wi-Fi was introduced on board, in the public areas on each vessel. In July 2012, spa treatment areas were added to the [[MV Pont-Aven|Pont-Aven]] and the [[MV Cap Finist<U+00E8>re|Cap Finist<U+00E8>re]]. In these on-board spas a wide range of treatments are available from manicures and pedicures to facials and massages.

[[HSC Normandie Express]] has more limited facilities, such as a smaller shop and a bar/cafe.

==Brittany Ferries <U+00C9>conomie==
Brittany Ferries <U+00C9>conomie operates budget crossings between [[Portsmouth International Port]] and [[Le Havre]], and [[Portsmouth International Port]] and [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. Crossings are operated aboard [[MV <U+00C9>tretat]], the former [[Norman Voyager]]. There are cabins, each en-suite but without carpets. Brittany Ferries have also introduced Pet Friendly cabins onboard Etretat, as these have proved popular on their Spanish Crossings aboard [[MV Cap Finist<U+00E8>re]].

[[MV <U+00C9>tretat]] is designed for passengers who want a reasonable fare, but without the cruise-style experience Brittany Ferries offer on all their other ships.
