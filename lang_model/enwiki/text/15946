'''Devil's Tower Road''' is a road in the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. The road in northeastern Gibraltar runs south of [[Gibraltar International Airport]], from [[Winston Churchill Avenue]] east to [[Eastern Beach Road]]. It was named after [[Devil's Tower (Gibraltar)|Devil's Tower]], a [[seventeenth century]] [[watchtower]] that was formerly at the eastern end of the road. [[Prehistoric]] man resided in what is now the Devil's Tower Road area, with [[Neanderthal]] remains found at [[Forbes' Quarry]] and the Devil's Tower [[rock shelter]]. The former discovery, made in 1848, represents the first discovery in history of a Neanderthal skull, known as [[Gibraltar 1]].

In 2007, the [[Government of Gibraltar]] revealed plans for a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]. By 2011, Devil's Tower Road had been changed to a [[dual carriageway]], with on-street parking eliminated. A new access road was planned, such that Winston Churchill Avenue, which crosses the [[runway]], would no longer serve as the main road to the [[Gibraltar-Spain border]]. Rather, an access road would connect with the eastern end of Devil's Tower Road, pass through an underground tunnel, and after emerging north of the runway, extend to the west.  However, the contractor [[Obrasc<U+00F3>n Huarte Lain|OHL]] stopped working on the project and, by August 2011, had lost the <U+00A3>34M contract. In 2012, OHL initiated legal proceedings against the Government of Gibraltar, and the government started the tender process for the access road and tunnel project for the second time.

Prehistoric man resided in what is now the Devil's Tower Road area, at Forbes' Quarry, in the north face of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. This was the site of the 1848 discovery of the first Neanderthal skull by Lieutenant [[Edmund Henry R<U+00E9>n<U+00E9> Flint]] of the [[Royal Artillery]].<ref name=seven/><ref name=geology>{{cite journal|coauthors=Stringer, Christopher B.|title=Gibraltar woman and Neanderthal Man|journal=[[Geology Today]]|date=September-October 1997|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/78902886/Gibraltar-Woman-and-Neanderthal-Man|accessdate=9 October 2012|author=Rose, Edward P.

Lieutenant Flint, secretary of the [[Gibraltar Scientific Society]], presented his discovery to the organization on 3 March 1848.<ref name=geology/><ref name=hominid/> Eight years later, in 1856, remains were discovered in a cave of the [[Neander Valley]] near [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Germany]]. Those remains were described in 1864 as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' by W. King of [[Queen's College, Galway]], now University College.<ref name=geology/> Later that year, the Gibraltar Skull was sent to [[England]] and exhibited  at the 1864 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], with its similarity to the Neander Valley remains noted. However, it wasn't until the early [[twentieth century]] that it was realized that Gibraltar 1 was the skull of a Neanderthal. If its significance had been understood in the [[nineteenth century]], Neanderthal Man would probably have been Gibraltar Man.<ref name=seven/><ref name=geology/><ref name=hominid/>  

More evidence of Neanderthal occupation was found at the Devil's Tower [[Mousterian]] rock shelter, also at the north face of the Rock of Gibraltar. In 1926, the skull of a Neanderthal child, [[Gibraltar 2]] or Devil's Tower Child, was discovered by [[archaeologist]] [[Dorothy Garrod]].<ref name=geology/><ref name=hominid>{{cite web|title=Hominid Hunting - The Rock of Gibraltar: Neanderthals' Last Refuge|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/hominids/2012/09/the-rock-of-gibraltar-neanderthals-last-refuge/|date=19 September 2012|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Buxton, L.

[[File:Nueva terminal gibraltar.JPG|thumb|240px|right|New terminal at [[Gibraltar International Airport]]]]
In May 2007, the Government of Gibraltar revealed plans for the new terminal at Gibraltar International Airport, as well as the new road to the North Front. Following the [[C<U+00F3>rdoba Airport Agreement]], it was decided that the main road that led to the area north of the airport runway would no longer cross the runway. Rather, it would be diverted, such that its first leg was along Devil's Tower Road. At the junction with Eastern Beach Road, there would be a roundabout. The new road, a four lane road, with two lanes in each direction, would U-turn to the north and parallel Eastern Beach Road. Then, it would go through a tunnel at the eastern end of the runway. After emerging on the north, the new road would parallel the frontier extending to the west. The road would then split, with one branch to the terminal, North Front, and Winston Churchill Avenue, and the other to the loop and frontier. Winston Churchill Avenue would continue to cross the runway, but would only be used for emergencies or other exceptions. Pedestrian traffic across the runway would be unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Air Terminal at Gibraltar Airport|url=http://www.gibraltarairterminal.com/at-the-airport/airport-news/41-airport/122-new-air-terminal-at-gibraltar-airport.html|work=gibraltarairterminal.com|publisher=GibraltarAirTerminal.com|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=17 May 2007}}</ref> 

In May 2009, the government announced that Devil's Tower Road would be changed to a [[divided highway]], to connect the new road at the North Front with Winston Churchill Avenue. In addition, the route of the eastern end of Devil's Tower Road would be adjusted to link it with the new roundabout adjacent to [[Eastern Beach, Gibraltar|Eastern Beach]]. The redevelopment of the road continued into 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Road to North Front - Devil's Tower Road Works|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2009/105-2009.pdf|work=gibraltar.gov.gi|publisher=[[Government of Gibraltar]]|accessdate=8 October 2012|date=21 May 2009}}</ref><ref name=removed>{{cite news|title=Two Bishops' Names See Devil Removed From Our Streets|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21735|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]|date=17 May 2011}}</ref> After the change of Devil's Tower Road to a dual carriageway, parking on the road was eliminated. Instead, parking spaces were made available at a new parking garage on Devil's Tower Road and an enlarged parking lot at Forbes' Quarry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Government establishes North District Pilot Parking Scheme|url=http://www.7daysgibraltar.com/article.php?id=4677|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=7 Days - Gibraltar's Free Weekly Newspaper}}</ref>

In May 2011, the Government of Gibraltar revealed that it was renaming Devil's Tower Road as North Front Avenue. The Government indicated that the change was justified by the slight realignment of the eastern portion of the road, such that it would no longer pass in close proximity to the former site of Devil's Tower. However, that proposal met with opposition due to the historical significance of the road, as well as the unnecessary inconvenience to residents. Both the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]] and the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Gibraltar)|Progressive Democratic Party]] expressed their opposition.<ref name=vox/><ref name=removed/><ref>{{cite news|title=Heritage Trust Supports Retaining Old Street Names|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21879|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=2 June 2011}}</ref> The [[Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party]] (GSLP)/Liberal Opposition suggested instead that the road be named Bishop Devlin Avenue to commemorate the late Bishop [[Bernard Patrick Devlin|Bernard Devlin]], the former pastor of St. Theresa's Church.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opposition Suggest Devil's Tower Name to be Wholly Changed|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=20948|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=27 January 2011}}</ref> On 2 June 2011, a one hour silent protest organized by lawyer Patrick Canessa was held over the announced plans to change the names of both Devil's Tower Road and [[Cannon Lane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Save Cannon Land and Devil's Tower Road - 1 hour silent protest|url=http://www.facebook.com/events/133560173388008/?ref=nf|work=facebook.com|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Protestors Fire Broadside over Cannon Lane|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21899|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=4 June 2011}}</ref>
