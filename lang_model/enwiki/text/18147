== History ==
{{details|History of Woking}}

Woking's history starts in 673AD. Woking began around this time as a settlement of a [[Wessex]] tribe, followers of Wocca. The name has been corrupted and was spelt as Woccingas, Wochinges, Wokynge, Wochynghe at different times. 

Woking appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Wochinges''. It was held partly by [[William the Conqueror]] and partly by Ansgot and Godfrey from Bishop Osbern of [[Exeter]]. Its domesday assets were: 3<U+00BD> [[hide (unit)|hides]]; 1 church, 2 [[Mill (grinding)|mills]] worth 13s 10d, 31 [[plough]]s, 46 acres of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] worth 161 [[hog (swine)|hogs]]. It rendered <U+00A3>24 10s 0d. Also 15s to the sheriff each year.<ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book]</ref>

Modern Woking was formed around the [[railway station]] built over 150 years ago at the junction between trains to the south coast,  the [[South West England|south-west of England]] and the necropolis railway to [[Brookwood Cemetery]]. This [[cemetery]] was developed by the [[London Necropolis Company]] as an overflow burial ground for London's dead.  Later, Woking was home to the first [[crematorium]] in the United Kingdom (St Johns) and the first [[mosque]] in the UK (on Oriental Road). The Shahjehan Mosque was commissioned by [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Shahjehan]], [[Begum of Bhopal|Begum]] of [[Bhopal (princely state)|Bhopal]] (1868-1901), one of the four female Muslim rulers of Bhopal who reigned between 1819 and 1926.

== Politics ==

The [[Woking (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Woking]] has historically been a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] [[safe seat]], with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] the principal opposition in the last two [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general elections]]. Its current [[Member of Parliament]] is [[Humfrey Malins]], who has a majority of around 6,500. The borough council is currently run by the Conservatives.

== Facilities ==

Woking has a modern shopping centre called [[The Peacocks]] and an older shopping area, Wolsey Place.<ref>[http://www.wolseyplace.co.uk/ Wolsey Place web site]</ref>

The main area for evening entertainment is around Chertsey Road<ref>[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=500738&y=158860&z=1&sv=500750,158750&st=4&ar=Y&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf Map showing Chertsey Road]</ref> which contains restaurants serving a number of [[cuisine]]s and there are also numerous bars and pubs. The Ambassadors cinemas<ref name=AmbassadorsNewVictoria>[http://www.theambassadors.com/woking/ Web site for the Ambassadors cinemas and New Victoria Theatre]</ref> and  [[New Victoria Theatre]]<ref name=AmbassadorsNewVictoria> </ref> can be accessed via the top floor of The Peacocks.

Woking has indoor swimming pools, "Pool in the Park",<ref>[http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisuretourism/leisurecentreandpoolhome/pool/ Pool in the Park web site]</ref> and a separate leisure centre. Outdoor facilities include a [[skatepark]], [[tennis court]]s, [[five-a-side football]] pitches, a [[cricket pitch]] (during the summer), [[bowling green]]s, a [[crazy golf]] course, and a children's adventure playground.  These leisure facilities are all located within the attractively landscaped Woking Park<ref>[http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisure/recreation/venues Woking Park web site]</ref> near to the town centre.

The scene at St Peter's Church, Old Woking is an inspiration for many local artists, as is another local beauty spot at the lock at St John's Lye.<ref>[http://www.surreyartists.co.uk/aaw/websites/surreyartists/david_drury_2.htm (a)] [http://www.surreyartists.co.uk/aaw/websites/surreyartists/david_drury_3.htm (b)] Two sites on David Drury, a local artist</ref>

There is also a [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighter painted silver and mounted on a pole roughly ten metres tall outside the Big Apple family entertainment complex. This was used to promote the previous Planets family entertainment complex, designed to look like a space craft, and has never been removed. However, originally the craft was black with various logos and livery on it. These were removed when the Planets complex was taken over.

== Energy policy ==

:''See related article: '''[[Energy policy of the United Kingdom]]''' 

Woking council is one of country's leaders in adopting greener energy technologies. Several [[cogeneration|combined heat and power stations]] provide [[district heating]] and [[electricity]], and electricity is also provided by a combination of [[Hydrogen economy|hydrogen fuel]] cells and [[solar cell]]s dispersed throughout the borough. These are linked via an innovative private electricity distribution system operating completely off the public [[Electric power transmission|power grid]].

In order to do this the local government laid new power lines to all locations on the Woking [[sustainable community energy system]] (due to [[Department of Trade and Industry]] regulations). Should the public power grid fail, central Woking would continue to have an energy supply.<ref name=Energypolicy>
{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/renewable/Story/0,2763,1131002,00.html|title= Woking shines in providing renewable energy|first=Paul|last=Brown|publisher=The Guardian|date=[[2004-01-26]]}}</ref>

The cost for providing this  is approximately [[Pound sterling|UK<U+00A3>]]0.01/[[kilowatt-hour|kWh]] less than for public electricity. It has been reported that the [[borough]] saves UK<U+00A3>974,000 a year in energy costs if the installation costs are ignored.<ref name=Energypolicy> </ref> By March 2004 the initiatives had also cut the borough's [[carbon dioxide|carbon emissions]] by 17.24%, and those of the council by 77.4%.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=5234 London Climate Change Authority Press Release]</ref>

Woking Station Canopy, which was approved by Woking Councillors in March 2004, is being built in 2007. It is equipped with photovoltaic cells to collect sunlight and convert it into energy.<ref>[http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=000044FD9112.C0A801C2.00004C3D.001C Woking government news ''Final stage of the canopy to Albion Way'']</ref> 

On Friday 23rd March 2007, Prince Charles opened a climate change exhibition in Woking. The exhibition, which is a joint venture by Business in the Community and BCSC and endorsed by the Climate Group, featured display stands with information on issues like recycling, energy use, transport, waste reduction and food sources.  He also inspected work on the Albion Square canopy. After the launch, the prince took lunch at Auberge. He then gave a speech to introduce Al Gore<U+2019>s film An Inconvenient Truth, which was being viewed by local business leaders.

Accordingly, there are frequent trains to and from [[Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] (via [[Clapham Junction]]), a journey taking approximately half an hour.  There is also the twice hourly [[Waterloo via Weybridge railway service|Waterloo/Woking stopping service]] that calls at many stations between Waterloo and Woking.

A canopy has been built between the station and the main shopping area of the town. It stretchs from the railway station entrance (town - platform 1 - side) to Albion House and includes landscaping of the area which, along with the canopy, creates a new entrance to the town from the railway station.<ref>[http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=000044FD9112.C0A801C2.00004C3D.001C Woking borough press release]</ref>

== Sport ==

'''Football'''

Woking has a [[non-League football|non-League]] [[football club]], [[Woking F.C.]], that competes in the [[Conference National|Nationwide Conference]] (tier 5).  The origin of the club's [[nickname]], the "Cards", is disputed.  One attractive proposal is that the name was acquired because Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], after whom the smaller of the two shopping centres is named, was staying with [[King Henry VIII]] at [[Woking Palace]] (the remains of which can be seen near the [[River Wey]] at Old Woking) when he heard he had been made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1515.  A more prosaic alternative is that the Cards are so named because of the [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal red]] in one half of their home strip. It is interesting to note that this colour was chosen because of the town's link to Cardinal Wolsey.
