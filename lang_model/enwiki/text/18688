The '''Hungarian Revolution'''<ref>Alternate references are "Hungarian Revolt" and "Hungarian Uprising"; "Revolution" is used as it conforms to both English [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26566.htm (see U.S. Department of State background on Hungary)] and Hungarian ("forradalom") conventions.  Princeton's [[WordNet]][http://wordnet.princeton.edu/] distinguishes between Revolution and its alternates as a matter of either succeeding to overthrow a government ("revolution") or merely trying (alternates).  The 1956 Hungarian event, although shortlived, is a true "revolution" in that the sitting Government was indeed deposed.  Unlike "coup d'etat" or "putsch" which imply action of a few, the 1956 revolution was effected by the masses.</ref><!-- Suggestion: if someone could find a Hungarian Gov't publication, or a Hungaraian encyclopedia that referred to the "revolution" it might be used to show that the word is common usage for this event in Hungary --> '''of 1956''' was a spontaneous nationwide [[revolt]] against the [[People's Republic of Hungary|authoritarian communist government]] of [[Hungary]] and its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] imposed policies, lasting from [[October 23]] until [[November 10]] of 1956.<!-- The state police are part of the regime; no need to state the obvious. In any case, what is the non-AVH police force if not also state police? Answer: The police supported the revolution and fought with the people, the <U+00C1>VH (State Police) fought against the revolutionaries / the casual Western reader may understand "security police" akin to "security guards" but "state police" is unambiguous, this will change to "State Security Police"--> It began as a student demonstration which attracted thousands as it marched through central [[Budapest]] to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]].  A student delegation entering the Radio Building attempting to broadcast [[Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956|their demands]] was  detained. When the delegation's release was demanded by the demonstrators outside, they were fired upon by the [[State Protection Authority|State Security Police]] (<U+00C1>VH) from within the building. The news spread quickly and disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital. 

The revolt spread quickly across [[Hungary]], and the government fell. Thousands organized into militias, battling the State Security Police (<U+00C1>VH) and Soviet troops. Pro-Soviet communists and <U+00C1>VH members were often executed or imprisoned, as former prisoners were released and armed. Impromptu councils wrested municipal control from the communist party, and demanded political changes.  The new government formally disbanded the <U+00C1>VH, declared its intention to withdraw from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and pledged to re-establish free elections.  By the end of October, fighting had almost stopped and a sense of normalcy began to return.

Although it had previously agreed to a ceasefire, the [[Politburo]] reversed itself and now moved to quash the revolution. On [[November 4]], a large Soviet force invaded Budapest using artillery and air strikes, killing thousands of civilians. Organized resistance ceased by [[10 November]] [[1956]], and mass arrests began.  An estimated 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. By January 1957 the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. Soviet actions alienated many Western [[Marxism|Marxists]], yet strengthened Soviet control over [[Eastern Europe]], cultivating the perception that communism was both irreversible and monolithic.

Public discussion about this revolution was suppressed in Hungary for over 30 years, but since the thaw of the 1980's has been a subject of intense study and debate.<ref>{{cite conference | first = G<U+00E9>mes | last = Andreas  | authorlink =  | coauthors = James S.

== Prelude==
After [[World War II]], the Soviet military occupied Hungary and [[salami tactics|gradually replaced]] the freely-elected [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|government]] with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]].<ref name="UNPara47">"By 1948, leaders of the non-Communist parties had been silenced, had fled abroad or had been arrested, and in 1949, Hungary officially became a People<U+2019>s Democracy. Real power was in the hands of M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi, a Communist trained in Moscow. Under his r<U+00E9>gime, Hungary was modelled more and more closely on the Soviet pattern. Free speech and individual liberty ceased to exist. Arbitrary imprisonment became common and purges were undertaken, both within and outside the ranks of the Party. In June 1949, the Foreign Minister, L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk, was arrested; he was charged with attempting to overthrow the democratic order and hanged. Many other people were the victims of similar action.(1) This was made easier by the apparatus of the State security police or <U+00C1>VH, using methods of terror in the hands of the r<U+00E9>gime, which became identified with R<U+00E1>kosi<U+2019>s r<U+00E9>gime in the minds of the people."

===Postwar occupation===
After World War II, Hungary fell under the Soviet [[sphere of influence]] and was occupied by the [[Red Army]].<ref>The Library of Congress: [http://www.photius.com/countries/hungary/national_security/hungary_national_security_soviet_southern_grou~105.html Country Studies; CIA World Factbook] Retrieved 13 October 2006</ref> By 1949 the Soviets had concluded a [[Comecon|mutual assistance treaty]] with Hungary which granted the Soviet Union rights to a continued military presence, assuring ultimate political control.<ref>In 1949 the ruling communist parties of the founding states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance were also linked internationally through the [[Cominform]] [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Library of Congress Country Studies Appendix B -- Germany (East)]</ref>

Hungary began the postwar period as a multiparty free democracy.  Elections of 1945 produced a [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|coalition government]] under Prime Minister [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Tildy]].<ref>Norton, Donald H. (2002).

In 1945, Soviet Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov]] forced the freely-elected Hungarian government to yield the Interior Ministry to the [[Hungarian Communist Party]].  Communist Interior Minister [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk]] established the [[State Protection Authority|Hungarian State Security Police]], later known as the <U+00C1>VH, which employed brutal means such as torture to suppress political opposition.<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter II.N, para 89(xi) (p. 31)] {{PDF}}</ref> The brief period of [[multiparty]] [[democracy]] came to an end when the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (Hungary)|Social Democratic Party]] to become the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]], standing its candidate list unopposed in 1949.

===Political repression and economic decline===
[[Image:nkm343.jpg|120px|thumb|left|[[M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi]]]]
Hungary became a [[People's Republic of Hungary|communist state]] under the totalitarian leadership of  [[M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi]].  The Security Police (<U+00C1>VH) began a series of purges in which dissidents were denounced as <U+201C>[[Titoism|Titoists]]<U+201D> or <U+201C>western agents<U+201D>, and forced to confess in [[show trials]].<ref name="Tokes317">T<U+0151>k<U+00E9>s, Rudolf L.

Gati describes "the most gruesome forms of psychological and physical torture...The reign of terror (by the R<U+00E1>kosi government) turned out to be harsher and more extensive than it was in any of the other Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe." He further references a report prepared after the collapse of communism, the Fact Finding Commision ''Torvenytelen szocializmus'' (Lawless Socialism): "Between 1950 and early 1953, the courts dealt with 650,000 cases (of political crimes), of whom 387,000 or 4 percent of the population were found guilty. (Budapest, Zrinyi Kiado/Uj Magyarorszag, 1991, 154).</ref>

The R<U+00E1>kosi government thoroughly politicized Hungary's educational system in order to supplant the educated classes with a "toiling intelligentsia".<ref>{{hu icon}} In February 1950, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party defined the supplantion of bourgeois leaders as its main goal. J<U+00F3>zsef Darvas, the Minister of Education and Religion from February 1950, wrote about secondary educational reforms in the pedagogical magazine ''K<U+00F6>znevel<U+00E9>s'' ([[17 September]] [[1950]]): "The conversion of different grammar schools to industrial technical institutes, agricultural technical institutes, economical vocational high schools and training-colleges for school teachers and kindergarten instructors tends to the success of the [[planned economy|five year plan]]  by supplying many of the needed technicians." On [[30 October]] 1950, new guidelines were set for the colleges and universities: Marxism-Leninism should be the main subject in all classes, and studying the [[Russian language]] became mandatory. By the end of 1951, 107 new course books were issued, 61 of which were translations of texts used in Soviet universities. The number of students had to be increased by an additional 30,000 over the next five years. {{cite journal

On [[March 5]], [[1953]], [[Joseph Stalin]] died, ushering in a period of [[destalinization|moderate liberalization]] in which most European communist parties developed a reformist wing. In Hungary, [[Imre Nagy]], who had a reformist economic and political platform, replaced M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi, "Stalin's Best Hungarian Disciple", as Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite paper | author = J<U+00E1>nos M.

On [[May 14]], [[1955]], the [[Soviet Union]] created the [[Warsaw Pact]], binding Hungary to the Soviet Union and its [[satellite state]]s in Eastern Europe. Among the principles of this alliance were "respect for the independence and sovereignty of states" and "noninterference in their internal affairs".<ref>{{cite web | last = Halsall | first = Paul (Editor)

In 1955, the [[Austrian State Treaty]] and ensuing declaration of neutrality established [[Austria]] as demilitarized and neutral. This raised Hungarian hopes of also becoming neutral.

R<U+00E1>kosi's resignation in July of 1956 emboldened students, writers and journalists to be more active and critical in politics. Students, assisted by the Writers<U+2019> Union, started a series of intellectual forums examining the problems facing Hungary.

On [[16 October]] [[1956]], university students in [[Szeged]] snubbed the official communist student union, the DISZ, by re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), a democratic student organization, previously banned under the R<U+00E1>kosi dictatorship.<ref name="Crampton295"/> Within days, the student bodies of [[P<U+00E9>cs]], [[Miskolc]], and [[Sopron]] followed suit.

===Interlude===
====Hungarian political changes====
[[Image:Imre_nagy1.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Imre Nagy]], head of the National Government formed on 27 October]]
The rapid spread of the uprising in the streets of Budapest and the abrupt fall of the Ger<U+0151>-Heged<U+0171>s government left the new national leadership surprised, and at first disorganized. Nagy, a loyal Party reformer described as possessing "only modest political skills"<ref>{{cite book | last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press | date = 2006 | month = September  | id = ISBN 0804756066 }} (page 52)</ref>, initially appealed to the public for calm and a return to the old order. Yet Nagy, the only remaining Hungarian leader with credibility in both the eyes of the public and the Soviets, "at long last concluded that a popular uprising rather than a counter-revolution was taking place."<ref>{{cite book | last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press | date = 2006 | month = September  | id = ISBN 0804756066 }} (page 173)</ref> Calling the ongoing insurgency "a broad democratic mass movement" in a radio address on [[October 27]], Nagy formed a government which included some non-communist ministers.  This new National Government abolished both the <U+00C1>VH and the one-party system.<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter II.F (Political developments), paragraph 66 (p. 22)] {{PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Zinner | first = Paul E. | title = Revolution in Hungary | publisher = Books for Libraries Press | date = 1962 | id = ISBN 0836968174 }}</ref> Because of its short tenure, the National Government could not clarify its policies, which were strongly influenced by popular opinion.  Editorials stressed that Hungary should be a neutral, multiparty [[social democracy]].<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary''(1957) [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter XII.D (Reassertion of Political Rights), paragraph 583 (p. 179) and footnote 26 (p. 183)] {{PDF}}</ref> Many political prisoners were released, most notably [[J<U+00F3>zsef Cardinal Mindszenty]]. Political parties which were previously banned, such as the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders]] and the [[Social Democrats]], reappeared to form a coalition government. 

Local revolutionary councils formed throughout Hungary at the town and district levels, generally without involvement from the preoccupied National Government in Budapest, and assumed various responsibilities of local government from the defunct communist party apparatus.<ref name=rc>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter XI (Revolutionary and Workers' Councils), paragraph 485-560 (pp. 154-)] {{PDF}}</ref> By [[30 October]], these councils had been officially sanctioned by the Hungarian Workers' (Communist) Party, and the Nagy government asked for their support as "autonomous, democratic local organs formed during the Revolution".<ref name=rc/> Likewise, [[workers' councils]] were established at industrial plants and mines, and many unpopular regulations such as production norms were eliminated.  The workers' councils strove to manage the enterprise whilst protecting workers' interests; thus establishing a socialist economy free of rigid party control.<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) [http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter II.E (Revolutionary and Workers' Councils), paragraph 63 (p. 22)] {{PDF}}</ref> Local control by the councils was not always bloodless; in [[Debrecen]], [[Gyor]], [[Sopron]], [[Mosonmagyar<U+00F3>v<U+00E1>r]] and other cities, crowds of demonstrators were fired upon by the <U+00C1>VH, with many lives lost. The <U+00C1>VH were disarmed, often by force, in many cases assisted by the local police.<ref name=rc/>

==== Soviet perspective ====
On 24 October, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Soviet Central Committee]] discussed the political upheavals in Poland and Hungary. A delegation in Budapest reported that the situation was not as dire as had been portrayed. Khrushchev stated that he believed that Party Secretary Ern<U+0151> Ger<U+0151>'s request for intervention on 23 October indicated that the Hungarian Party still held the confidence of the Hungarian public. In addition, he saw the protests not as an ideological struggle, but as popular discontent over unresolved basic economic and social issues.<ref name = satellite/>

Although it is widely believed that Hungary's declaration to exit the Warsaw Pact caused the Soviet military to crush the Revolution, minutes of the 31 October meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Party indicate that this declaration was only one of several contributing factors.<ref name = presidium>{{cite web  | title = Working Notes and Attached Extract from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting, October 31, 1956  | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents  | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive  | date = November 4, 2002  | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc6.pdf  | format = {{PDF}}  | accessdate = 2006-07-08}}</ref> Although a hard-line faction around [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] was pushing for intervention, Khrushchev and Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]] were initially opposed to intervention. After some debate, the Presidium at first decided not to remove the new Hungarian government. 

Soon however, several key tendencies alarmed the Presidium and cemented the hard-line position:<ref>{{cite web  | last = Rainer | first = J<U+00E1>nos M. | title = Decision in the Kremlin, 1956 -- the Malin Notes  | work = Paper presented at Rutgers University | publisher = The Institute for the History of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution  | date = [[1996-11-01]] | url = http://www.rev.hu/archivum/rmj1.html | accessdate = 2006-09-07 }}</ref>
*Simultaneous movements towards multiparty parliamentary democracy, and a democratic national council of workers, which could "lead towards a capitalist state." Both movements challenged the pre-eminence of the Soviet Communist Party in Eastern Europe and perhaps Soviet [[hegemony]] itself. For the majority of the Presidium, the workers' direct control over their councils without Communist Party leadership was incompatible with their idea of socialism.<ref>{{cite book| last = Arendt| first = Hannah | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Origins of Totalitarianism | publisher = Harcourt| date = 1951| location = New York| url =  | pages = pp. 480-510| id = ISBN 0-15-670153-7}}</ref>
*With the Western powers involved in the [[Suez Crisis]], the Presidium was concerned with a perception of weakness by the Soviet Union in dealing with a regional uprising within the Eastern Bloc. Referring to France, Britain and the United States, Khrushchev reportedly stated "To Egypt, they will then add Hungary."<ref name = presidium/>
*Khrushchev stated that members of the Soviet party would not understand a failure to respond with force in Hungary. [[De-Stalinization]] had alienated the more conservative elements of the Party, who were alarmed at threats to Soviet influence in Eastern Europe. On June 17, 1953, workers in [[East Berlin]] staged an [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprising]], demanding the resignation of the government of the [[German Democratic Republic]]. This was quickly and violently put down with the help of the Soviet military, with 84 strikers killed and wounded and 700 arrested.<ref>Cold War International History Project (CWIHP), [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction=va2.document&identifier=5034CF83-96B6-175C-9D4EF24C4DBDEABE&sort=Collection&item=Germany%20in%20the%20Cold%20War Report from A.

Additionally, by late October, unrest was noticed in some regional areas of the European Soviet Union: while this unrest was minor, it was intolerable.
*Hungarian neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact represented a threat to the Soviet defensive and ideological [[buffer zone]] of [[satellite nation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Okv<U+00E1>th | first = Imre  | title = Hungary in the Warsaw Pact: The Initial Phase of Integration, 1957 - 1971  | journal = The Parallel History Project on NATO and the Warsaw Pact | date = 1999 | url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_4/texts/introduction_okvath.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-04 }} by permission of the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich and the National Security Archive at the George Washington University on behalf of the PHP network</ref> Soviet international relations in central Europe were influenced by a deeply-ingrained fear of invasion from the West, which cemented the Soviet concept of a necessary defensive buffer of allied states in central Europe.

With this combination of political and foreign policy considerations, the Presidium decided to break the de facto ceasefire and crush the Hungarian revolution. The plan was to declare a "Provisional Revolutionary Government" under J<U+00E1>nos K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r, who would appeal for Soviet assistance to restore order.

By 9:30 p.m. on 3 November, the Soviet Army had completely encircled Budapest.  At 3:00 a.m. on 4 November, Soviet tanks penetrated Budapest along the Pest side of the Danube in two thrusts: one up the Soroks<U+00E1>ri road from the south and the other along the V<U+00E1>ci road from the north.  This effectively split the city in half before a single shot was fired.  Armored units crossed the Danube into Buda and at 4:25 a.m. fired the first shots at the army barracks on Buda<U+00F5>rsi road.

Despite Cold War rhetoric by the West espousing a rollback of the domination of Eastern Europe by the USSR, and Soviet promises of the imminent triumph of socialism, national leaders of this period as well as later historians saw the the failure of the uprising in Hungary as evidence that the Cold War in Europe had become a stalemate.<ref>Johns Hopkins University Professor Charles Gati, in his book ''Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt'' (see Further reading, below), agreed with a 2002 essay by Hungarian historian Csaba Bekes "Could the Hungarian Revolution Have Been Victorious in 1956?". Gati states: "Washington implicitly acknowledging the division of the continent into two camps, understood that Moscow would not let go of a country bordering on neutral but pro-Western Austria and an independent Yugoslavia, so it shed ...tears over Soviet brutality, and exploited the propaganda opportunities..." (p. 208)</ref> [[Heinrich von Brentano]], Foreign Minister of West Germany, recommended that the people of Eastern Europe be discouraged from "taking dramatic action which might have disastrous consequences for themselves."

In France, moderate communists, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] resigned, questioning the policy of supporting Soviet actions by the [[French Communist Party]]. The French philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] wrote an [[The Blood of the Hungarians|open letter]] criticizing the West's inaction.

In December 1991, the preamble of the treaties with the dismembered Soviet Union, under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and Russia represented by [[Boris Yeltsin]], apologized officially for the 1956 Soviet actions in Hungary. This apology was repeated by Yeltsin in 1992 during a speech to the Hungarian parliament.<ref name = cnn/>

On [[13 February]], 2006, the [[US State Department]] commemorated the Fiftieth anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.
