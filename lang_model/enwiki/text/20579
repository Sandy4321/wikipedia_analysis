'''''Waptia fieldensis''''' is an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[arthropod]] from the [[Middle Cambrian]] [[Burgess Shale]] ''[[Lagerst<U+00E4>tte]]'' of [[Canada]]. It grew to a length of about {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and resembled modern [[shrimp]] in both morphology and [[Habit (biology)|habit]]. It had a large bivalved [[carapace]] and a segmented body terminating into a pair of tail flaps. It was an active swimmer, feeding on organic particles it gathers from the seafloor substrate.

Based on the number of individuals, ''Waptia fieldensis'' is the third most abundant arthropod from the Burgess Shale Formation, with thousands of specimens collected. It was among the first [[fossil]]s found by the American [[paleontologist]] [[Charles D. Walcott]] in 1909. He described it in 1912 and named it after two mountains near the discovery site <U+2013> [[Mount Wapta]] and [[Mount Field (British Columbia)|Mount Field]]. 

''Waptia fieldensis'' is the only species classified under the [[genus]] '''''Waptia'''''. Although it bears a remarkable resemblance to modern [[crustacean]]s, its [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] affinities remain unclear. It is currently classified as a [[stem group]] crustacean and tentatively included in the [[clade]] [[Crustaceomorpha]].

==Description==
''Waptia fieldensis'' had a maximum body length of {{convert|8|cm}}.<ref name="bs"/> The [[exoskeleton]] was very thin and easily distorted from [[fossilisation]]. It possessed a large bivalved [[carapace]] that was narrow at the front with wide posterior margins that covered the [[cephalon]] and most of the [[thorax]]. The cephalon had five short [[somite]]s (body [[Segmentation (biology)|segments]]) with three to five pairs of small and poorly preserved feeding appendages.<ref name="walcott">{{cite journal|author=Charles D.

The [[thorax]] is divided into two groups of somites. The anterior group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past the margins of the carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are [[biramous]], but they are assumed to be the [[endopodite]]s, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the [[exopodite]]s, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.<ref name="walcott"/><ref name="berg">{{cite book|author=Jan Bergstr<U+00F6>m & Xian-Guang Hou|editor=Stefan Koenemann & Ronald A.

The posterior thoracic group is made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace.<ref name="walcott"/> They bear a fringe of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans.<ref name="berg"/> Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive.

==Taphonomy==
Specimens of ''Waptia fieldensis'' were recovered from the [[Burgess Shale]] ''{{lang|de|[[Lagerst<U+00E4>tte]]}}'' of [[Canada]], which dates from the [[Middle Cambrian]] period (510 to 505 million years ago).<ref name="morris1986">{{cite journal|author=Simon Conway Morris|year=1986|title=The community structure of the Middle Cambrian Phyllopod Bed (Burgess Shale)|journal=Palaeontology|volume=29|issue=Part 3|pages=423<U+2013>467}}</ref> The locality was once about {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} underwater; it was located at the bottom of a warm and shallow tropical sea adjacent to a submarine [[limestone]] cliff (now the [[Cathedral Limestone Formation]]). [[Undersea landslide]]s caused by the collapse of parts of the limestone cliff would periodically bury the organisms in the area (as well as organisms carried by the landslides) in fine-grained mud that later became [[shale]].<ref name="hagadorn">{{cite book|author=James W.

Based on the number of individuals, ''Waptia fieldensis'' constitutes about 2.55% of the total number of organisms recovered from the Burgess Shale, and 0.86% of the [[Greater Phyllopod bed]].<ref name="caron"/> This makes them the third most abundant arthropods of the Burgess Shale (after ''[[Marrella]]'' and ''[[Canadaspis]]'').<ref name="gould"/><ref name="morris1986"/> The [[National Museum of Natural History]] alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the Burgess Shale.<ref name="taylor2">{{cite journal|author=Rod S.

==Taxonomy==
''Waptia fieldensis'' is the only [[species]] accepted under the [[genus]] ''Waptia''. It is classified under the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Waptiidae]] (established by Walcott in 1912), the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Waptiida]] (established by [[Leif St<U+00F8>rmer]] in 1944), and (tentatively) the [[clade]] [[Crustaceomorpha]].<ref name="taylor2"/><ref name="mikko">{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~mhaaramo/metazoa/protostoma/arthropoda/crustacea/crustaceomorpha.html|title=Crustaceomorpha <U+2013> crustaceans and related arthropods|author=Mikko Haaramo|date=October 4, 2007|publisher=Mikko's Phylogeny Archive|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref> Early restorations of ''Waptia fieldensis'' by [[Charles R.

}} Some authors have suggested that it may be allied to [[crustacean]]s, but like many [[Cambrian]] crustaceomorphs, the [[Arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]] were not preserved, making it impossible to reliably classify them within the crustacean [[crown group]]. Others propose that it may only be distantly related to crustaceans, being at least a [[stem group]] of crustaceans or even of all arthropods.<ref name="bs"/> Despite being one of the first species recovered and being the the third most abundant fossils of the Burgess Shale, there is still no in-depth work on the morphology of ''Waptia fieldensis''.<ref name="taylor2"/> 

In 1975, an apparently very similar species was described from the [[Lower Cambrian]] (515 to 520 million years ago) [[Maotianshan Shale]] ''{{lang|de|Lagerst<U+00E4>tte}}'' of [[Chengjiang]], [[China]]. It was originally placed within the "ostracod"-like genus ''[[Mononotella]]''. In 1991, Xian-Guang Hou and Jan Bergstr<U+00F6>m reclassified it under the new genus ''[[Chuandianella]]'' when additional discoveries of more complete specimens made its resemblance to ''W. fieldensis'' more apparent. Like ''W. fieldensis'', ''C. ovata'' had a bivalved carapace with a median ridge, a pair of caudal rami, a single pair of antennae, and stalked eyes. In 2004, Jun-Yuan Chen tentatively transferred it to the genus ''Waptia''. However, ''C. ovata'' had eight abdominal somites in contrast to five in ''W. fieldensis''. Its limbs were biramous and were undifferentiated, unlike those of ''W. fieldensis''.<ref name="taylor2"/> Other authors deemed these differences to be enough to separate it from ''Waptia'' to its own genus.<ref name="bs"/><ref name="liu">{{cite journal|author=Hu-Qin Liu & De-Gan Shu|year=2004|title=New information on ''Chuandianella'' from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang Fauna, Yunnan, China|trans_title=<U+6F84><U+6C5F><U+5316><U+77F3><U+5E93><U+4E2D><U+5DDD><U+6EC7><U+866B><U+5C5E><U+5316><U+77F3><U+7684><U+65B0><U+4FE1><U+606F>|journal=Journal of Northwest University (Natural Science Edition)|language=Chinese|volume=34|issue=4|pages=453<U+2013>456|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?anno=2&hl=en&rurl=translate.google.com.ph&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&twu=1&u=http://www.lw23.com/pdf_a4456a32-3294-4029-9188-02baf761bc8f/lunwen.pdf&usg=ALkJrhgmLDJobZvG70e4mgRGhvPrmjI4nw}}</ref> 

In 2002, a second similar species, ''[[Pauloterminus spinodorsalis]]'', was recovered from the Lower Cambrian [[Sirius Passet]] ''{{lang|de|Lagerst<U+00E4>tte}}'' of the [[Buen Formation]] of northern [[Greenland]]. It was also identified as a possible waptiid. Like ''C. ovata'' it had biramous undifferentiated appendages, but it also had only five abdominal somites like ''W. fieldensis''. However, the poor preservation of the ''P. spinodorsalis'' specimens, particularly of the appendages on the head, make it difficult to ascertain its taxonomic placement. This is compounded by the evidence that the fossils of ''P. spinodorsalis'' may in fact be moults ([[exuvia]]e), and not of the actual animal.<ref name="taylor2"/>
