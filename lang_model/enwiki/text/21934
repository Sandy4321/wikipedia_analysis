The '''Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory''', also known as the '''Stewart Observatory''' (a name adopted in the 1980s), is a small [[observatory]] located on the grounds of the [[University of Toronto]]. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by [[Edward Sabine]] to determine the cause of fluctuations in [[magnetic declination]]. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that [[sunspot]]s were responsible for this effect on [[Earth's magnetic field]].<ref name=schools/> When this project ended in 1853, the observatory was taken over by the Canadian government, greatly expanded in 1855, and operated as the primary meteorological station and official Canadian timekeeper for over fifty years. The Observatory is the country's oldest surviving scientific institution,<ref name="gcca"/> and is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.<ref name="chang">{{Cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041030003827/http://www.exn.ca/apollo/Links/index.cfm?ID=19990514-61 |title =Astronomy in Canada |author= Chang, Gloria |publisher= The Discovery Channel |year= 1999 |date= May 14, 1999|accessmonthday=July 24 |accessyear= 2008}}</ref>

[[Compass]]es tend to "wander" from north when measurements are taken at different locations or even at a single location over a period of time. The astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] first noted this and the problems it would cause for [[navigation]] in 1701.<ref>Gurney, pg. 27</ref> It was further believed that whatever was causing this effect might also be causing changes in the weather, and so that studying magnetic variance might lead to better weather prediction.<ref>Thomas, ''The Toronto Observatory''</ref>

In 1833 the British Association for the Advancement of science commissioned [[Edward_Sabine#The_Magnetic_Crusade|a series of magnetic measurements]] across the [[United Kingdom]]. Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the [[Royal Artillery]], a multi-year measuring project began, with the results to be published in 1838.<ref name=thiessen309>Thiessen, pg. 309</ref> As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] wrote to [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], then President of the [[Royal Society]], stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe.<ref name=thiessen309/> At the seventh meeting of the Royal Society in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that "the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit" and mapping its variations would be "regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking".<ref>Qtd. in Thiessen, pg. 308, from ''Report of the Seventh Meeting of the British Association of the Advancement of Science'', 1838</ref>

In 1837, the [[University of Dublin]] funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at [[Greenwich]]. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in 1838 their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided.<ref name=thiessen309/> In 1839 the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in [[Cape Town]], [[St. Helena]], [[Hobart, Tasmania]], and (eventually) [[Toronto]].<ref name=thiessen310>Thiessen, pg. 310</ref> Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on [[Saint Helen's Island]] off [[Montreal]], but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead.<ref>Thiessen, pg. 312</ref> The team arrived in 1839, and set up camp at [[Fort York]] in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings.  The observatory was given {{convert|10|acre|ha}} of land to the west of King's College; the [[Ontario Legislature]] now occupies the area on which the college was located.<ref name=thiessen310><ref name=Thiessen>Thiessen, pg. 331</ref>

The observatory, officially "Her Majesty's Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory at Toronto", was completed the following year. It consisted of two log buildings, one for the magnetic instruments and the other a smaller semi-buried building nearby for "experimental determinations".  The north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a [[theodolite]] used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time.  The buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible; when metal was required, non-magnetic materials such as [[brass]] or [[copper]] were used.<ref name="gcca">{{Cite web |url=http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/sciences/magnetic_observatory.asp |title=Canada's First Magnetic Observatory |publisher=Canadian Space Agency |year=2005|accessmonthday=July 24 |accessyear= 2008}}</ref> A small barracks was built nearby to house the crew.

Using the measurements from the Toronto and Hobart sites, Sabine noticed both short-term fluctuations in magnetic declination over a period of hours, and longer-term variations over months.  He quickly concluded that the short term variations were due to the day/night cycle, while the longer term ones were due to the number of visible sunspots. He published two introductory papers on the topic in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.  The first, in 1851, was a collection of early measurements; the second in 1852 correlated with [[Heinrich Schwabe]]'s sunspot measurements, which had been made widely available in Alexander von Humboldt's ''Cosmos'', also published in 1851.<ref name="thomas">Thomas</ref>  With further data collected from the Toronto site, Sabine was able to demonstrate conclusively that the eleven-year [[sunspot cycle]] caused a similarly periodic variation in the Earth's magnetic field.<ref name="gcca"/> He presented a third and conclusive paper on the topic in 1856, "On Periodical Laws Discoverable in the Mean Effects of the Larger Magnetic Disturbances", in which he singled out the Toronto site for particular praise.<ref name="sabine">Sabine</ref>

==Meteorological service==

In 1853 the Royal Society's project was concluded, and the observatory was set to be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station under the direction of the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Ministry of Marine and Fisheries]]. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.<ref name=b109>Beattie, pg. 109</ref>

The current building was designed in 1853 by local architect [[Frederick William Cumberland|Frederick Cumberland]], who was also working on the design of [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], which was being built just north of the Observatory to replace King's College. The new observatory design called for a stone building, with an attached tower containing the theodolite. The new building was completed in 1855, and stands directly opposite the entrance of today's [[Convocation Hall]].<ref name=b109/>

During its time as a meteorological station, the Observatory collected reports from 312 observation stations in Canada and another 36 in the United States. Each station was equipped with a "Mercurial Barometer, two Thermometers (a maximum and a minimum Thermometer), an Anemometer to measure the velocity of the wind, a Wind Vane and a Rain Gauge".<ref name=schools/> Reports were sent in coded form to the Observatory at 8&nbsp;am and 8&nbsp;pm every day, [[Eastern Standard Time]] (then known as "75th meridian time"), and used to produce a chart predicting the weather for the following 36 hours. These predictions were then telegraphed across the country, and charts were distributed to newspapers and the Board of Trade, where they could be viewed by the public. With the installation of telephones, the Observatory also offered weather reports on demand, which was an important service to fruit vendors, who used the reports to plan shipping.<ref name=schools/>

Among its other uses, in 1880, measurements from the site were used as part of the effort to develop [[standard time]].<ref name="UTMSI">{{Cite web |url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/utmusi/observatory.html |title= The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory |publisher=University of Toronto Museum of Scientific Instruments|accessmonthday=July 24 |accessyear= 2008}}</ref> The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to [[Ottawa]]'s [[Dominion Observatory]]. At exactly 11:55&nbsp;am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an electrical signal from the Observatory.<ref name=schools>Hodgins</ref>

In 1881 the observatory's director, Charles Carpmeal, suggested adding a quality telescope to the observatory. He felt that direct solar observations would lead to a better understanding of sunspot effects on weather (as late as 1910 the observatory's then-director, R. F. Stupart, noted that "sun spots have more to do with our weather conditions than have the rings around the moon."<ref name=schools/>). Coincidentally, the Canadian government (having [[Canadian Confederation|formed in 1867]]) was interested in taking part in the major international effort to accurately record the December 1882 [[Transit of Venus]].

Funds were provided for the purchase of a 6-inch (150&nbsp;mm) [[refracting telescope]] from [[T. Cooke & Sons]]. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable to take part in the transit measurements due to bad weather,<ref name="chang"/><ref name=beattie117>Beattie, pg. 117</ref> and missed the 1895 [[Transit of Mercury]] for the same reason.<ref name=b115>Beattie, pg. 115</ref>

[[Image:Louis B Stewart Observatory.JPG|thumb|The observatory viewed looking north-northeast, with Hart House in the background. The rotation of the tower is more obvious here: compare the location of the windows with the images above.]]

By the 1890s, the observatory had become crowded by the rapidly growing university. Electrification of the tramways along [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] just to the south, and the large quantities of metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments.<ref name=beattie117/> A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in [[Agincourt, Toronto|Agincourt]]&mdash;now a suburban area in the northeast of the city&mdash;leaving the campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.<ref name="geo">In turn, in 1968 the Agincourt observatory was replaced by one in Ottawa.  See {{Cite web |url= http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/obs/ott_e.php |title= Ottawa Observatory |publisher= Natural Resources Canada |year= 2005 |accessmonthday=July 24 |accessyear= 2008}}</ref>

By 1907, new university buildings completely surrounded the observatory; dust from the construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and move to a new building at the north end of campus on [[Bloor Street]], trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land.<ref name=beattie118>Beattie, pg. 118</ref> There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.

The university assumed ownership of the now-disused Observatory building and was originally going to abandon it. [[Louis Beaufort Stewart]], a lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, campaigned for it to be saved for the Department of Surveying and Geodesy. He eventually arranged for the building to be re-constructed on a more suitable site. Demolition work was carried out in 1907: the stones were simply left in place over the winter, and were used the following year to construct a re-arranged building just east of the main University College building (south of [[Hart House]]).<ref name="faught">Faught</ref><ref name=beattie118/>

In 1930 the Meteorological Office no longer used the Cooke telescope, and agreed to donate it to the university if they would handle its removal. Both the telescope and the observatory dome were moved to the Stewart Observatory.<ref>Beattie, pg. 123</ref> The telescope moved once again in 1952 to the [[David Dunlap Observatory]] north of the city, and in 1984 it was donated to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]]. The Department of Surveying and Geodesy used the observatory until the 1950s. Since then the office areas have been used for a variety of purposes, including a police substation and a telephone switchboard.<ref name=beattie117/> The Old Observatory was handed over to the Students' Administrative Council (now [[University of Toronto Students' Union]]) in 1953, which has used the building since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.sa.utoronto.ca/sg/detail.lasso?orgreference=114 |title= University of Toronto Students<U+2019> Union (UTSU) (formerly known as the Students<U+2019> Administrative Council (SAC))|date=2003 |publisher=Office of Student Affairs, University of Toronto |accessmonthday=July 27 |accessyear= 2008|quote=Main Office - St. George Campus, Stewart Observatory}}</ref>  The dome, now unused, receives a yearly multi-color paint job by engineering students.
