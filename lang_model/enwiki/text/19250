'''''Journals of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the private journals of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], and published in 1997, 15 years after her death. It was edited by David Harriman with the approval of Rand's estate.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, her private papers were left to her student and heir, [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Starting in 1983, Peikoff began authorizing the publication of excerpts from her journals and other unpublished writings. From 1983 to 1994, several such excerpts appeared in ''[[The Objectivist Forum]]''<ref>The excerpts published in ''The Objectivist Forum'' were:<br/>"Philosophic Journal" (August 1983)<br/>"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (December 1983)<br/>"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (April 1984)<br/>"Philosophic Notes" (August 1984)<br/>"Notes for The Fountainhead" (December 1984)</ref> and ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]''.<ref>The excerpts published in ''The Intellectual Activist'' were:<br/>"From Ayn Rand's Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (January 1992)<br/>"Notes on Scene in Roark's Apartment" (January 1993)<br/>"Notes on the Thomas Committee" (November 1993)<br/>"'Memory-Storing' Epistemology" (January 1994)<br/>"Ayn Rand's Journals: Selections from The Moral Basis of Individualism" (November 1995)<br/>"From Ayn Rand's Journals: Notes on The Fountainhead" (January and March 1997)</ref> David Harriman, a physicist and a speaker for the [[Ayn Rand Institute]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=5256  |title=David Harriman |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> edited Rand's journals for publication in book form. The hardcover edition of the fully edited ''Journals of Ayn Rand'' was published in 1997. A paperback edition followed in 1999.

==Contents==
In a foreword for the book, Peikoff describes Rand's journals, with a few exceptions, as being "written for herself, for her own clarity" and not intended for publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=vii}}</ref> A preface by Harriman describes the material as being about three-quarters of Rand's "''working'' journals", collected from "numerous boxes of papers she left behind at her death". He describes his editing as consisting of "selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatory comments."<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=xv}}</ref> He says that "not a great deal of line editing was required", and that his editorial insertions and "omissions of passages" are marked in the published text.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pages=xvi-xvii}}</ref>

The majority of the book consists of Rand's edited journals, divided into five major sections. The first section, titled "Early Projects" includes scenarios for silent movies that Rand developed when she first moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. There are also notes and outlines for her first published novel, ''[[We the Living]]'' and for another early novel that was never completed. Entries in an early "philosophic journal" from April and May 1934, are described by Rand as "the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher."<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=66}}</ref>

The second section, titled "''The Fountainhead''", consists material related to her [[The Fountainhead|novel of that name]]. She took extensive notes from her research on architecture, and created profiles for each character, often based on information about real people. There are several outlines of the plot and notes she made while the novel was being written.

The third section, titled "Transition Between Novels", includes draft material for three unfinished projects. The first was a non-fiction book to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. The second was a movie about the development of the [[atomic bomb]], tentatively titled ''Top Secret''. The third was an essay called "To All Innocent Fifth Columnists", to be circulated by a proposed organization of conservative intellectuals that never formed. This section also reprints a transcript of Rand's 1949 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], along with her own notes about the committee's efforts to investigate [[Communism]].

The fourth section, "''Atlas Shrugged''", has her notes and outlines for her [[Atlas Shrugged|final novel]]. In addition to planning for characters and plot points, her notes include research on the railroad and steel industries, and thoughts on various philosophical issues to be addressed in the novel.

The fifth and final section, "Final Years", covers the years 1955 to 1977. It includes notes about "psycho-epistemology" and ideas for two possible books. One was a non-fiction book about Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. The other was a novel to be titled ''To Lorne Dieterling''.

==Reception==
Objectivist philosopher [[David Kelley]] described the material in Rand's journals as "contain[ing] a number of passages that explain key points in her philosophy more fully and clearly than anything she published." Kelley called the book "a treasure" and said Harriman's editing was "skillful", although he criticized Harriman for not providing more complete notes on cases where Rand had later changed her positions from those documented in the journal entries.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Autobiography of an Idea |url=http://www.objectivistcenter.org/showcontent.aspx?ct=74 |first=David |last=Kelley |authorlink=David Kelley |journal=Navigator |volume=1 |issue=6 |month=February |year=1998}}</ref> Writing for the [[libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], [[Walter Olson]] said the book was "a less-than-ideal place to start for those not already closely familiar with the Russian-born author's work." However, he said it did "furnish a deep popcorn bowl of sheer fan value" for those interested in Rand.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/30499.html |title=The Writerly Rand |first=Walter |last=Olson |authorlink=Walter Olson |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |month=February |year=1998 |volume=29 |issue=9}}</ref>

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', conservative writer [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] offered his "harsh assessment" that the insights Rand had about the dangers of collectivism were "made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it." For aspiring writers, he said, "The journals' central lesson is that one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Wonder That Is Me |first=David |last=Brooks |authorlink=David Brooks (journalist) |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/05/books/the-wonder-that-is-me.html?pagewanted=all |date=October 5, 1997 |page=38}}</ref> This review produced responses in the form of a short article in ''Liberty'' calling it an "uninformed hatchet job"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Babbling Brooks |journal=[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]] |first=Ralph |last=Raico |month=January |year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |page=11}}</ref> and a letter from philosopher [[Allan Gotthelf]] calling it "the usual sneers".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rand is not going to go away |url=http://www.capitalism.org/journals/letters/letter2.htm |first=Allan |last=Gotthelf |authorlink=Allan Gotthelf |date=November 15, 1997 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

In a bibliography of Rand's works, [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] said the book "illustrates Rand<U+2019>s dedication to her craft and her meticulous preparation for writing."<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=88}}</ref> Both Brooks and Gladstein indicated that the term 'journals' was misleading because the material focuses on Rand's works and ideas, instead of more personal thoughts.

Reviews of the book were also published in the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''The Washington Post'', and ''The Tampa Tribune''. 

===Concerns about editing===
In a review of the book in [[Liberty (1987)|''Liberty'']] magazine, [[Stephen D. Cox|Stephen Cox]] questioned the editorial choices made by Harriman. He said that Harriman tried "to steer a middle course" between casual and scholarly readers of Rand's work, but he wondered "where should the line be drawn?" He cited examples given by Harriman as the types of passages omitted, saying some of them were "precisely the kind of note that scholars want to see". Cox also said that Harriman's editing for grammar and "wordiness" were insufficiently explained, which acted "to undermine the objective authority of the text."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Cox |authorlink=Stephen D. Cox |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/liberty.htm |title=The Evolution of Ayn Rand |journal=Liberty |month=July |year=1998 |volume=11 |number=6 |pages=50-51}}</ref>

In an article in next issue of ''Liberty'', Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] raised additional concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in ''The Intellectual Activist'' with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to [[Albert Jay Nock]] in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to noted in the text, and said, "When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Chris Matthew |last=Sciabarra |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/liberty.htm |title=Bowdlerizing Ayn Rand |journal=Liberty |month=September |year=1998 |volume=11 |number=7 |page=65}}</ref> Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}</ref>

While writing a biography of Rand, historian Jennifer Burns worked with the original journals in the Ayn Rand Archives, and compared the material there with published versions. She said Rand's journals had been edited in ways that are "significant and problematic."<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=291}}</ref> Burns said Harriman's changes "significantly alter Rand's meaning" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into "a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear."<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=292}}</ref> In an entry on her blog describing her experiences at the archives, Burns said the staff of the archives "heartily disapproved" of how the book was edited.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the Rand Archives, Part 2: The edited letters and diaries |url=http://www.jenniferburns.org/blog/65-in-the-rand-archives-part-2-the-edited-letters-and-diaries |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |date=September 13 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>
