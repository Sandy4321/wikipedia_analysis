'''Alexander Bichkov''' (known as Russia's Rambo) was a man who lived alone in a Russian forest for nearly 20 years, possessing a great arsenal, occasionally stealing from and "terrorizing" locals, and burning down nearby houses. He was shot to death by police on March 14, 2008.

Speculation would seem that it appears that the terrorized locals would destroy Bichkov's animal traps, perhaps being his main source of nutrition and life.
Although the locals seem to have claimed that he was so scary looking and such a terrifying entity that without protection their children could have been harmed, although no sources indicate as such.
