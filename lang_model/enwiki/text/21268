Nemicandra was a prolific author and a specialist in summarizing and giving lucidly the essence of teachings in various fields; ''sa<U+1E43>grahas'' (collections) and ''s<U+0101>ras'' (essence) were his specialty. He who also wrote ''Trilokas<U+0101>ra'' (essence of cosmology), ''Labdhis<U+0101>ra'' (essence of attainments), ''K<U+1E63>apa<U+1E47>as<U+0101>ra'' (essence on destruction of karmas), and  ''Gomma<U+1E6D>as<U+0101>ra'' (essence of  Gommata, a treatise on soul and Karma).<ref name=balbir1>Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of Introduction </ref> Altghough not much is known about him from his own works, at the end of the ''Trilokas<U+0101>ra'' and of the ''Gomma<U+1E6D>as<U+0101>ra'', he introduces himself as a pupil of Abhayanandi, V<U+012B>ranandi, Indranandi and Kanakanandi.

In the second verse Jiva is defined ; and tbe several Characteristics of Jiva men<U+00AC>tioned in the definition are taken up one by one in verses 3<U+2013>14 After this detailed description of Jivas the author proceeds to describe Ajivas<U+2014>Pudgala, Dharma, Dharma, Akasa and Kala, each of which is defined in verses 16<U+2013>22.
