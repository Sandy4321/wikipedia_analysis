'''Ickenham''' is a suburban area, centred on an old village in [[Greater London]], and is part of the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]].

While no major historical events have taken place in Ickenham, settlements dating back to the [[Roman occupation of Britain]] have been discovered during archaeological surveys, and the area appears in the Domesday Book. Buildings from the [[14th century|14th]], [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th]] centuries remain standing and have been restored in recent years.

The village was originally split into four manors, which became two: Ickenham and Swakeleys. The old manorial home of Swakeleys, a [[17th century]] [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] mansion [[Swakeleys House]] still exists for corporate use. Ickenham's manorial home, Manor Farm, now forms part of Long Lane Farm. A military station, [[RAF West Ruislip]], was opened in 1917. Its final use was for the Navy Exchange of the [[U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom]] command between 1975 and 2006.

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 Census]], Ickenham at that time had a population of 329,<ref name="Bowlt p.133">{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

===Toponomy===
Ickenham appears in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' three times under the name 'Ticheham'. Translated from [[Latin]], the second entry reads:
{{cquote|Manor Ickenham answers for 9<U+00BD> hides.{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} 3 men-at-arms and 1 Englishman hold it from Earl Roger.

The ''Domesday Book'' describes the land as being predominantly flat and composed of [[London clay]] with the exception of [[alluvium]] along the banks of the [[River Pinn]]. Of the few archaeological surveys of Ickenham carried out, one in 1994 by the [[Museum of London]] found a system of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fields, dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries along with pottery fragments. Research suggest that the area may have been abandoned for a period following the departure of the Romans from Britain around AD 410.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

===Early developments===
[[File:Swakeleys House - April 2011.JPG|thumb|right|Swakeleys House was built in 1638]]
Ickenham was originally divided into the four manors of Ickenham, Tykenham, Swalcliff (Swakeleys) and Herses (Hercies). Tykenham and Herses were within the parish of [[Hillingdon]], though Herses subsequently became part of the manor of Swalcliff.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Ickenham |last=Hughes |first=Morris. W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |location=Uxbridge |isbn=0-907869-04-1 |page=13 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> These manors were eventually merged to form the main manors of Ickenham and Swakeleys. The original lord of the manor of Ickenham was Geoffrey de Mandeville, from whom it passed to William de Brock and then, in 1334, to John Charlton whose son John owned Swakeleys from 1350. By the mid-14th century, Ickenham was owned by the Shorediche family who retained possession until 1819.<ref name="Hughes p.17">{{cite book |title=The Story of Ickenham |last=Hughes |first=Morris. W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |location=Uxbridge |isbn=0-907869-04-1 |page=17 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>

The Crosier family, major landowners in north-west Middlesex, moved to Ickenham in the 16th century. They established their manorial home as Sherwyns, and owned Home Farm and Sears house in 1624. After the Shorediche family  Milton Farm was bought by William Crosier in 1685. Edward Hilliard become the direct descendent of the final member of the Crosier family, John Crosier. Under the Hilliards, Milton Farm was sold to become part of the Swakeleys estate in 1816, and Hill Farm become [[RAF Northolt|Northolt Aerodrome]] in 1916.<ref name="Bowlt p.17"/> The Shorediche family built their manor house on a track off Long Lane. Originally called Ickenham Hall, it was let out to farmers in 1818 and renamed Manor Farm,<ref name="Bowlt p.17">{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |location=Uxbridge |isbn=0-907869-04-1 |page=15 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>

Swakeleys manor, subordinate to Ickenham, was named after Robert Swalcliffe, who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century. He appears in records as Robert de Swalclyve and Robert de Wykeham, reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in [[Oxfordshire]]. In 1347, he owed <U+00A3>40 to a money lender, Roger Rikeman, which he was unable to pay, and so his land in Ickenham was passed by Rikeman in 1350 to John de Charlton.<ref name="Hughes p.17"/>

A descendent of John de Charlton, the first Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and [[Member of Parliament]] for Middlesex. He died in 1465, at which point his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor. Sir Richard was killed fighting on the side of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] during the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485. The victor of the battle, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], named him in his [[Act of Attainder]], though he granted Sir Richard's wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor. However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas' death in 1510, the manor passed to Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the [[Earl of Devon]], [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Henry Courteney]] in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.<ref name="Hughes p.17"/>

[[File:St Giles'_Church_-_April_2011.jpg|thumb|right|St Giles' church dates back to 1335]]
The lords of the manor of Swakeleys resided at [[Swakeleys House]], though the house that stands today was not the first on the site. The original dated to around the 1300s and was probably constructed of [[Wattle-and-daub|wattle]] and timber. It was subject to extensive remedial work, much lamented at the time, while under the ownership of John Bingley. Bingley later sold the estate to Sir Edmund Wright, a future [[Lord Mayor of London]], in 1629, and the current house was built of brick in 1638.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

A church at Ickenham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and it is likely that residents travelled to nearby [[Harefield]] for services. The original [[nave]] and [[chancel]] of St Giles' church have been dated to 1335 while the nave was extended west in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stgileschurch.co.uk/history/index.htm |title=History |author= |date= |work= |publisher=St Giles' Church, Ickenham |accessdate=11 April 2011}}</ref> The bell turret was built in the [[15th century]] and a brick aisle added in 1575.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

'The Pump' is a significant local landmark. Donated to the village by Charlotte Gell, this water pump stands close to the village pond at the intersection of Swakeleys Road and Long Lane. After Gell's death in 1863, under the provisions of her will a water pump was sunk for the benefit for the community in 1866. The village pond next to the pump was dug at the same time as the {{convert|144|foot}} well for the pump was sunk in order to accomodate waste from the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Images of England: Ickenham |last=Skinner |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-3411X |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> An older pond on the other side of the village was filled in with the excavated earth from the new one.<ref>{{cite book |title=Around Ruislip |last=Newbery |first=Mary |authorlink= |coauthors=Cotton, Carolynne; Packham, Julie Ann; Jones, Gwyn |year=1996 |publisher=The Chalfont Publishing Company |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-0688-4 |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> In 1857 Gell had also donated some of her land near St Giles's Church for five [[almshouse]]s to be built for longstanding servants of the Gell household or Ickenham residents who were members of the [[Church of England]]. No more than three people were allowed to live in the houses at one time. The cottages remain and are maintained by the local church. Next to the pump stands the Coach & Horses public house, first licensed for the sale of alcohol in 1759 but of 16th century origin. The house was used for manorial courts throughout the [[19th century]] until the last was held in 1878.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

On 25 September 1905, following lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened a small [[Railway halt|halt]] on their line between [[Harrow on the Hill|Harrow]] and [[Uxbridge]]. The railway company had been reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached with the construction of the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors.<ref name="Bowlt p.133"/> The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ickenham.co.uk/history/1900.html |title=The Arrival of Public Transport The Metropolitan Railway |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ickenham Online |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref> The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ickenham.co.uk/history/1920.html |title=The Suburb That Never Was! |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ickenham Online |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref> Ickenham Halt was later rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ickenham.co.uk/history/1970.html |title=1970s |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ickenham Online |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref>

The [[marathon]] event of the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London passed through Ickenham and Uxbridge on its way to the [[White City Stadium]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Around Ruislip |last=Newbery |first=Mary |authorlink= |coauthors=Cotton, Carolynne; Packham, Julie Ann; Jones, Gwyn |year=1996 |publisher=The Chalfont Publishing Company |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-0688-4 |page=20 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>

As a result of the railway, more commuters gradually moved to Ickenham and travelled to work in London. On 5 July 1922, {{Convert|1382|acres}} of the Swakeleys estate was auctioned for development, thereby significantly reducing its size. Roads laid out for the new development were Warren Road, Swakeleys Drive, Court Road, Milton Road, Ivy House Road, The Avenue and Thornhill Road (originally named Park Road). Other land bordering the [[River Pinn]] was designated as public open land.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

The road was widened to become a [[dual carriageway]] in 1937. Milton Farm, one of the farms on the former Swakeleys estate was demolished in 1939. The farm's pond and listed barn were cleared to make way for housing in what became Milton Road and Milton Court, though marketed as "Ickenham Garden City".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Ickenham |last=Hughes |first=Morris.

A military station, operated by the Royal Air Force and later the [[United States Navy]], was opened on part of Home Farm close to the parish boundary with Ruislip in 1917, later becoming known as [[RAF West Ruislip]]. The site was used originally for the British No. 4 Maintenance Unit, together with the RAF Records division. It became involved in the repair of aircraft equipment and later in the servicing of American vehicles from [[RAF South Ruislip]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

[[File:St Giles's Church and village pump.jpg|thumb|right|St Giles' church and the Pump, circa 1900]]
The original village school was built on Ickenham High Road in 1866, although by 1920 it had become overcrowded. Older children were moved to the village hall in 1928 under the name Ickenham Temporary Council School. In 1929 the village school closed and its infant pupils also moved to the village hall. The road was widened in 1934 necessitating demolition of the school building along with the original Fox & Geese public house.<ref>{{cite book |title=Images of England: Ickenham |last=Skinner |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-3411X |page=58 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>

The village pump remained in use until December 1914, while the the handle was removed in 1921 by the local council for safe keeping but was never returned. The pump was restored in 2004 in partnership with a local building company,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ickenhamchurchnews.co.uk/0311/index.htm |title=Local Heritage Site Work Gets The Go Ahead |author= |date=November 2003 |work= |publisher=Ickenham Church News |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> and a similar handle was fitted during the works.<ref name="Skinner"/>

Breakspear Primary School was built in 1937, followed by Glebe Primary in 1952 on the other side of the railway line.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ickenham & Harefield Past |last=Bowlt |first=Eileen.

The village hall, designed by Clifton Davy, was built on part of Church Farm in 1926. Opened by [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]], as well as becoming the temporary village school the hall also became a restaurant during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and went on to be used as a bank and a [[polling station]]. A police telephone box was constructed next to the Pump in February 1936, and became operational on 4 May 1936.<ref>{{cite book |title=Images of England: Ickenham |last=Skinner |first=James |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-3411X |page=18 |pages= |url= |accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> Church Farm opposite St Giles' church was demolished after the Second World War and replaced with shops, while new roads were built in the area. By 1951 the population of Ickenham had reached 7,107, and this had risen to 10,370 by 1961 and 11,214 by 1971. The ford over the River Pinn on Swakeleys Drive, nicknamed "The Splash", was replaced in 1957 by a road bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Ickenham |last=Hughes |first=Morris.
