'''Tristan Tzara''' (born '''Samuel''' or '''Samy Rosenstock''', also known as '''S. Samyro'''; [[April 4]] or [[April 16]], [[1896]]<ref name="enotestt">[http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/tzara-tristan "Tristan Tzara 1896<U+2013>1963"], in Susan Salas, Laura Wisner-Broyles, ''Poetry Criticism'', Vol. 27, Gale Group Inc., 2000, [http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com]; retrieved [[April 23]], [[2008]]</ref>&ndash;[[December 25]], [[1963]]) was a [[Romania]]n and [[France|French]] [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. A [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] influenced by the work of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara co-founded the magazines ''[[Simbolul]]'' together with [[Ion Vinea]], with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry, and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in [[Switzerland]]. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Z<U+00FC>nfte of Z<U+00FC>rich|Z<U+00FC>ntfhaus z<U+00FC>r Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. A main promoter of Dada culture, he represented its [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].

After moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the "presidents of Dada", joined the staff of ''[[Litt<U+00E9>rature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in Dada's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. Subsequently, he was involved in the major polemics which led to the movement's split, defending his principles against [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his plays ''[[Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> gaz]]'' ("The Gas Heart") and ''[[Mouchoir de nuages]]'' ("Handkerchief of Clouds"). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually rallied with Breton's Surrealism, and, under its influence, wrote his celebrated [[utopia]]n poem ''[[L'Homme approximatif]]'' ("The Approximate Man"). During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he took distance from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].

Tristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth, and was later married to [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].

==Name==
''S. Samyro'', a partial [[anagram]] of ''Samy Rosenstock'', was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s.<ref>Cernat, p.108-109</ref> A number of  undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature ''Tristan Ruia'', and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name ''Tristan''.<ref name="pcern109">Cernat, p.109</ref><ref name="jycmelusine">{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surr<U+00E9>aliste sur la colline de Montmartre''], at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism]; retrieved [[April 23]], [[2008]]</ref>

In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the ''Tzara'' part of his pseudonym in 1915.<ref name="pcern109"/> Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the "infamous pun" ''Triste <U+00C2>ne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for "Sad Donkey Tzara").<ref name="pcern109"/> This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan <U+0162>ara'' and ''Tr. Tzara'', in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his text long after committing them to paper).<ref>Cernat, p.109-110</ref>

In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun on the [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] ''trist <U+00EE>n <U+0163>ar<U+0103>'' ("sad in one's country"); Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbi<U+00E8>re]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera.<ref name="pcern110">Cernat, p.110</ref> Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]].<ref name="pcern110"/>

==Biography==
===Early life and  ''Simbolul'' years===
Tzara was born in [[Moine<U+015F>ti]], [[Bac<U+0103>u County]], in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Moldavia]]. His parents were [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanians]] who reportedly spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their first language;<ref>Cernat, p.35</ref> his father and grandfather were entrepreneurs in the forestry business.<ref name="iliv241">Livezeanu, p.241</ref> Owing to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]], and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.<ref name="iliv241"/> He moved to [[Bucharest]] at the age of eleven, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin [[boarding school]].<ref name="iliv241"/> It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the [[Saint Sava National College]]<ref name="iliv241"/> or as the Sf<U+00E2>ntul Gheorghe High School.<ref>Cernat, p.48-51</ref> 

In October 1912, when Tzara was aged sixteen, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing ''[[Simbolul]]''. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds.<ref name="pcern99">Cernat, p.99</ref> Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague [[Jacques G. Costin]], who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.<ref>Cernat, p.186-194</ref>

Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors. Alongside their close friend and mentor [[Adrian Maniu]] (an [[Imagism|Imagist]] who had been Vinea's tutor),<ref>Cernat, p.51</ref> they included [[N. Davidescu]], [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[I. M. Ra<U+015F>cu]], [[Eugeniu Speran<U+0163>ia]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Eugeniu <U+015E>tef<U+0103>nescu-Est]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]], as well as from journalist and layer [[Poldi Chapier]].<ref name="pcern49">Cernat, p.49</ref> In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, [[Alexandru Macedonski]].<ref name="pcern49"/> ''Simbolul'' also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and [[Iosif Iser]].<ref>Cernat, p.50, 100</ref> 

Although the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] of the period. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412</ref> Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming "an interface between arts", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].<ref>Cernat, p.47</ref> Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in stayle which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[G<U+00E2>rceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.<ref>Cernat, p.116-121</ref>

===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===
Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.<ref>Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109</ref> At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.<ref>Cernat, p.99, 100-108</ref> ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.<ref name="pcern99"/> According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was "totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment."<ref>Cernat, p.100</ref> During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri <U+015F>i Proz<U+0103>]]'', and [[Constantin R<U+0103>dulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revist<U+0103> Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>]]'' published his known poem ''Veri<U+015F>oar<U+0103>, fat<U+0103> de pension'' ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl") in June 1915.<ref>Cernat, p.108-109</ref>

Tzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying Mathematics and Philosophy, but did not graduate.<ref name="iliv241"/><ref name="ttunifi">{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html "Tristan Tzara"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved [[April 23]], [[2008]]</ref> In autumn 1915, he left Romania for the city of [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], in neutral [[Switzerland]]. Janco, together with his brother [[Jules Janco|Jules]], had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]].<ref>Cernat, p.110-111</ref> Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Zurich|local university]],<ref name="iliv241"/><ref name="mrdada">Marta Ragozzino, "Tristan Tzara", in ''Art e Dossier'', March 1994, Giunti, p.48</ref> shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the ''[[ETH Zurich|Technische Hochschule]]'', in the Altinger Guest House<ref>Cernat, p.111</ref> (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel).<ref>Richter, p.137</ref> His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] political statement.<ref>Cernat, p.132; Livezeanu, p.241, 249</ref> After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French.<ref name="ttunifi"/> The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogs between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care.<ref name="pcern116">Cernat, p.116</ref> Most of these pieces were first printed only in the [[interwar period]].<ref name="ttunifi"/><ref>Cernat, p.116, 130, 138, 153</ref>

It was in Z<U+00FC>rich that the Romanian group met with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Hugo Ball]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] poet and pianist, and his young wife [[Emmy Hennings]], a [[music hall]] performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.<ref>Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14</ref> Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel Slodki]], "readily agreed to take part in the cabaret."<ref>Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14</ref> According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, "Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry<!-- sic -->."<ref>Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14</ref> In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].<ref>Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14</ref> He was soon after involved in Tzara's "simultaneist verse" performance, "the first in Z<U+00FC>rich and in the world", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].<ref>Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30</ref>

===Birth of Dada===
[[Image:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]
It was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.<ref name="pcern112">Cernat, p.112</ref> The same type of performances took place at the [[Z<U+00FC>nfte of Z<U+00FC>rich|Z<U+00FC>ntfhaus z<U+00FC>r Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.<ref>Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48</ref> According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for at long as it lasted, "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired."<ref>Gendron, p.75</ref> Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vach<U+00E9>]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].<ref>Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173</ref>

In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: "[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for "international magazine"]."<ref name="hrich14">Richter, p.14</ref> Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: "The magazine shall be published in Z<U+00FC>rich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada."<ref name="hrich14"/> The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.<ref name="hrich123">Richter, p.123</ref>   

A secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.<ref name="hrich32">Richter, p.32</ref> Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of "[[hobby horse]]" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.<ref>Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32</ref> Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.<ref>Cernat, p.115-116</ref> Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for "mother" in an unspecified [[Italian dialects|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].<ref>Cernat, p.116; Londr<U+00E9>, p.397; Richter, p.31-32</ref>

===Dadaist promoter===
Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.<ref>Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londr<U+00E9>, p.396; Richter, p.33</ref><ref name="mrdada"/> This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.<ref>Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59</ref> With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of "an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater."<ref name="bgend77">Gendron, p.77</ref>

He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]], [[Paul <U+00C9>luard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].<ref name="hrich33">Richter, p.33</ref><ref name="jycmelusine"/> Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a "very cool and distant attitude to this new movement" before being approached by the Romanian author.<ref name="hrich33"/> In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''<U+2014>Richter describes his "energy, passion and talent for the job", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.<ref>Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33</ref> He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.<ref>Richter, p.45, 69-70</ref>

As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].<ref>Cernat, p.193</ref> Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: "we had swallowed Futurism<U+2014>bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated."<ref name="hrich33"/> Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.<ref>Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)</ref> Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the group Dada was poet and painter [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.<ref name="buddevo">S. Batchelor, "Existence, Enlightenment and Suicide: The Dilemma of Nanavira Thera", in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), ''The Buddhist Forum'', Vol. IV (Seminar Papers 1994-1996), [[Routledge]], London, 1996, p.11-13. ISBN 0728602555</ref>

The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent [[Italy|Italian]] visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as "fathers of Dada".<ref>Richter, p.39-40, 46</ref> He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),<ref name="jycmelusine"/> and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine.<ref name="hrich167">Richter, p.167</ref> In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Z<U+00FC>rich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in [[Berlin]]<U+2014>[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]].<ref>Hofman, p.7-8; Richter, p.102-114</ref> With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], whom he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland.<ref>Richter, p.137, 155, 159</ref> Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.397; Richter, p.137-138</ref>

As e result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called "Dada presidents", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Th<U+00E9>odore Fraenkel]].<ref>Richter, p.201</ref> Richter notes: "I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description."<ref>Richter, p.200-201</ref>

===End of World War I===
The shows Tzara staged in Z<U+00FC>rich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].<ref>Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39</ref> Hans Richter speaks of a "pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" (''see [[<U+00C9>pater la bourgeoisie]]'').<ref>Richter, p.24</ref> In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Z<U+00FC>rich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.<ref>Richter, p.66-67</ref> Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.<ref>Richter, p.47-48</ref> While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq po<U+00E8>mes'' ("Twenty-five poems").<ref name="rcard530">Cardinal, p.530</ref>

A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Z<U+00FC>rich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.<ref>Richter, p.70-74</ref> In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in [[New York City]], sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use "Dada" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: "Dada belongs to everybody").<ref>Hofman, p.12</ref> The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself "switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and anti-art into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness."<ref>Richter, p.71</ref> The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[K<U+00E4>the Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].<ref>Richter, p.74-78</ref> It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' ("Final Dissolution"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.<ref>Richter, p.78-80</ref>

Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.<ref>Richter, p.80</ref> Richter, who admits that the magazine was "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918-19|German revolts of 1918]], which "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change."<ref>Richter, p.80</ref> The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was "an association of revolutionary artists."<ref>Richter, p.80</ref> According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.<ref>Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. ISBN 0520223950</ref> 

Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.<ref name="pcern115">Cernat, p.115</ref> In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.<ref>Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183</ref> When Vinea submitted his poem ''Dolean<U+0163>e'' ("Grievances") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.123-124</ref>

===Paris Dada===
In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivi<U+00E8>re]] in editing the [[Paris]]-based magazine ''[[Litt<U+00E9>rature]]''.<ref>Cardinal, p.529-530; Hofman, p.12-14; Richter, p.167, 173</ref><ref name="mrdada"/> Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an "Anti-[[Messiah]]" and a "prophet".<ref name="hrich168">Richter, p.168</ref> Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display.<ref name="hrich168"/> Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.<ref name="hrich168"/>

He is often described as the main figure in the ''Litt<U+00E9>rature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada.<ref>Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.167</ref><ref name="mrdada"/> When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine "decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada."<ref name="hrich167"/> He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''.<ref>Hofman, p.13-14; Richter, p.173, 179-180</ref> At around that time, he met [[United States|American]] author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',<ref>"''Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''", in ''The Cambridge Handbook of American Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1986 p.13. ISBN 0521307031; Armstrong, p.496</ref> and the artist couple [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]] (with whom he worked in tandem for "poem-dresses" and other simultaneist literary pieces).<ref name="tgdelau">Tag Gronberg, "Sonia Delaunay's Simultaneous Fashions and the Modern Woman", in Whitney Chadwick, Tirza True Latimer (eds.), ''The Modern Woman Revisited: Paris between the Wars'', [[Rutgers University Press]], Piscataway, p.114-115. ISBN 0813532922</ref>  

Tzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or [[Paul <U+00C9>luard]].<ref>Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.173-176</ref><ref name="enotestt"/><ref name="jycmelusine"/> Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Derm<U+00E9>e]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]].<ref>Richter, p.173-174</ref> The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,<ref name="bgend77"/> or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or cut off on stage.<ref>Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.181</ref> In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Universit<U+00E9> populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.<ref>Richter, p.175-176</ref> Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that it had a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]].<ref>Richter, p.175-176</ref>

Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre de l'<U+0152>uvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Derm<U+00E9>e and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Premi<U+00E8>re aventure c<U+00E9>leste de M. Antipyrine'' ("The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine").<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.398; Richter, p.179-183</ref> Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout "cra" and "cri" on a rising scale, was also performed.<ref>Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.182</ref> A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.<ref>Richter, p.180-182</ref>

The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation.<ref>Cernat, p.125</ref> Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war.<ref>Cernat, p.127</ref> [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sbur<U+0103>torul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary "extremism".<ref>Cernat, p.126-127, 299</ref>

===Dada stagnation===
[[Image:St-Julien-le-Pauvre-Chor.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 "Dada excursion"]]
By 1921, Tzara was by then involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with spirit of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.127-128; Richter, p.122-123</ref> He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status.<ref name="hrich123"/> According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether, and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself.<ref>Richter, p.182-183, 192-193</ref> The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.<ref name="rcard530"/>

In April 1921, through a booklet proclaiming the "new interpretation of nature applied this time not to art, but to life",<ref name="jycmelusine"/> Dada called on the Parisian public join them on a trip to [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]] church. As they distributed copies of the document, the authors shouted insulting or provocative slogans to passers-by.<ref name="jycmelusine"/> This "Dada excursion", conceived as a manner of avoiding stagnation, failed to gain needed attention, and other members of the Parisian group came to share Breton's feelings.<ref>Richter, p.183-184</ref>

A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barr<U+00E8>s]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin P<U+00E9>ret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barr<U+00E8>s).<ref>Richter, p.184-186</ref> P<U+00E9>ret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed.<ref>Richter, p.184, 186</ref> In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical.<ref>Richter, p.184-185</ref> During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in [[Austria]], at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' ("Dada in the Open Air") or ''Der S<U+00E4>ngerkrieg in Tirol'' ("The Battle of the Singers in [[Tyrol]]").<ref>Richter, p.186 (illustration 96)</ref> Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918<U+2013>1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.<ref>Cernat, p.128</ref>

Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there).<ref>Cernat, p.127-128</ref> After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto.<ref>Cernat, p.130, 138, 153</ref> Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: the two avoided each other for the rest of their lives, and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems.<ref>Cernat, p.115, 137</ref> [[Julius Evola]] also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition, and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to [[esotericism]] and fascism.<ref name="buddevo"/>

===''Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> barbe''===
[[Image:Theo van Doesburg kleine Dada soir<U+00E9>e.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s poster for a Dada soir<U+00E9>e (ca.1923)]]
Tzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for ''[[Le Journal de Peuple]]'', where the Romanian writer was denounced as "an impostor" avid for "publicity".<ref>Cernat, p.114; Richter, p.188</ref> In March, Breton initiated the ''Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit''. The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and [[Christian Schad]].<ref name="pcern114">Cernat, p.114</ref> Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]]'s control.<ref name="pcern114"/> Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it,<ref>Richter, p.187</ref> responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists.<ref name="pcern114"/> Rumors reported much later by [[United States|American]] writer [[Brion Gysin]] had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the [[Prefecture of Police]].<ref name="nzgysin">[[Nicholas Zurbrugg]], "Brion Gysin", in ''Art, Performance, Media: 31 Interviews'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], Minneapolis, p.190. ISBN 0816638322</ref>

In parallel, Dada came to terms with its impending dissolution, and, in May 1922, staged its own funeral.<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.398; Richter, p.191</ref> According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in [[Weimar]], where the Dadaists attended a festival of the [[Bauhaus]] art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: "Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions."<ref>Richter, p.191</ref>

With ''Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> barbe'' ("The Bearded Heart"), a manifesto and public performance, a large group of modernists signed in favor of marginalizing Breton and supporting Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and <U+00C9>luard, the pro-Tzara faction included [[Erik Satie]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Serge Charchoune]], [[Louis-Ferdinand C<U+00E9>line]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Ilia Zdanevich]], and [[Man Ray]].<ref>Richter, p.188</ref> It was during the group's soir<U+00E9>e of July 1923 that Tristan Tzara first presented to the public his play ''[[Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> gaz]]'' (with costumes designed by [[Sonia Delaunay]]),<ref name="tgdelau"/> but the show was just then interrupted by an angry Breton, who reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, causing a riot that was only stopped by the intervention of authorities.<ref>Richter, p.190-191</ref> The scandal involving Breton and Tzara meant that Dada's vaudeville declined in importance, and disappeared altogether after that date.<ref>Gendron, p.78</ref> 

Picabia took Breton's side against Tzara,<ref>Hofman, p.15; Richter, p.188, 190</ref> and replaced the staff of his ''391'', enlisting collaborations from [[Cl<U+00E9>ment Pansaers]] and [[Ezra Pound]].<ref>Richter, p.188, 190</ref> Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. Richter indicates: "Surrealism devoured and digested Dada."<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.398; Richter, p.191</ref> Tzara took distance from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, progressively, with its politics.<ref name="rcard530"/><ref name="enotestt"/><ref name="mrdada"/> In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists were collaborators of Richter and the Constructivist artist [[El Lissitzky]] on the magazine ''G''.<ref>Haftmann, in Richter, p.221</ref>

===Transition to Surrealism=== 
[[Image:Loos house Paris Aug 2006 003.jpg|thumb|250px|''Maison Tzara'', designed by [[Adolf Loos]]]]
Tzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play ''[[Mouchoir de nuages]]'', which was soon after included as an additional piece in the repertoire of [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.<ref>Lynn Garafola, ''Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance'', [[Wesleyan University Press]], Middletown, 2005, p.172. ISBN 0819566748</ref> He also collected his his earlier Dada texts as ''Sept manifestes Dada'' ("Seven Dada Manifestos"). They were positively reviewed by [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Henri Lefebvre]], who later became one of the author's friends.<ref>[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: the Adventures of a Concept from Luk<U+00E1>cs to Habermas'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1984, p.293. ISBN 0520057422</ref> 

In Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by ''Contimporanul'', which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the "new art demonstration" of 1925.<ref>Cernat, p.153, 156, 159, 186</ref> In parallel, the short-lived magazine ''Integral'', where [[Ilarie Voronca]] and [[Ion C<U+0103>lug<U+0103>ru]] were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work.<ref>Cernat, p.277, 287</ref>

In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in [[Stockholm]], where he married [[Greta Knutson]], with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927).<ref name="jycmelusine"/> A former student of painter [[Andr<U+00E9> Lhote]], she was known for her interest in [[phenomenology]] and [[abstract art]].<ref name="prsurrgk">"Greta Knutson", in [[Penelope Rosemont]], ''[[Surrealist Women]]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London & New York, 1998, p.69. ISBN 0485300885</ref> Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]], a former representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] whom he had met in Z<U+00FC>rich, to build him a house in Paris.<ref name="jycmelusine"/> The rigidly [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] ''Maison Tristan Tzara'', built in [[Montmartre]], was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of [[African art]].<ref name="jycmelusine"/> It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.<ref name="jycmelusine"/>

In 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris.<ref name="rcard530"/><ref name="enotestt"/> The same year, he issued the poetry book ''De nos oiseaux'' ("Of Our Birds").<ref name="rcard530"/> This period saw the publication of ''[[L'Homme approximatif]]'' (1931), alongside the volumes ''L'Arbre des voyageurs'' ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), ''O<U+00FA> boivent les loups'' ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), ''L'Antit<U+00EA>te'' ("The Antihead", 1933) and ''Grains et issues'' ("Seed and Bran", 1935).<ref name="enotestt"/> By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay.<ref name="pcern277">Cernat, p.277</ref> In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of ''Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> barbe'', starring Breton and other leading Surrealists.<ref name="ttzimdb">{{imdb|0879262}}</ref> Five years later, he signed his name to ''The Testimony against Gertrude Stein'', published by [[Eugene Jolas]]' magazine ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' in reply to Stein's memoir ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',<!-- sic --> in which he accused his former friend of being a [[megalomania]]c.<ref>Armstrong, p.496</ref>

The poet became involved in further developing [[Surrealist techniques]], and, together with Breton and [[Valentine Hugo]], drew one of the better-known examples of "[[exquisite corpse]]s".<ref>[[Ion Biberi]], ''Arta suprarealist<U+0103>'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1973, p.53. {{OCLC|22905196}}</ref> Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend [[Ren<U+00E9> Char]], and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]].<ref>"Ren<U+00E9> Char Bio-Bibliography", in ''Selected Poems of Ren<U+00E9> Char'' (edited by [[Mary Ann Caws]] and Tina Jolas), [[New Directions Publishers]], New York, 1992, p.xii. ISBN 0811211916</ref> Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time.<ref name="prsurrgk"/><ref name="jycmelusine"/> This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.<ref name="jycmelusine"/><ref name="prsurrgk"/>

At home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter [[Sa<U+015F>a Pan<U+0103>]], who corresponded with him over several years.<ref>Cernat, p.49, 106, 109, 116</ref> The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care.<ref name="pcern116"/> In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend [[Jacques G. Costin]], a ''Contimporanul'' affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.<ref>Cernat, p.192-194</ref>

===Affiliation with communism and Spanish Civil War===
Alarmed by the establishment of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German regime]], which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of [[anti-fascism]], and was close to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by [[Kurt Schwitters]] in [[Hanover]], works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, [[ration stamp]] with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule.<ref>Richter, p.153</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] in [[Spain]], he briefly left France and joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]].<ref>Livezeanu, p.245-246</ref><ref name="enotestt"/> Alongside [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] reporter [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Tzara visited [[Madrid]], which was besieged by the [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]] (''see [[Siege of Madrid]]'').<ref name="iliv246">Livezeanu, p.246</ref> Upon his return, he published the collection of poems ''Midis gagn<U+00E9>s'' ("Conquered Southern Regions").<ref name="enotestt"/> Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure ''Les po<U+00E8>tes du monde d<U+00E9>fendent le peuple espagnol'' ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists<U+2014>[[Nancy Cunard]] and [[Chile]]an poet [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref>Susan Robin Suleiman, "Committed Painting", in Denis Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 1994, p.938.

Although the poet was moving away from Surrealism,<ref name="rcard530"/> his adherence to strict [[Marxism-Leninism]] was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.<ref name="pbeit49">Beitchman, p.49</ref> [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of [[Utopia]], which combined communist messages with [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[psychoanalysis]] and made use of particularly violent imagery.<ref>Beitchman, p.48-49</ref> Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the [[party line]], maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.<ref name="spbuot">{{ro icon}} Sorin Pop, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=9785&print=true "Fran<U+00E7>ois Buot, Tristan Tzara.

However, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, <U+00C9>luard and communist writer [[Ren<U+00E9> Crevel]], organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]], who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of [[William Tell]] had alarmed them because it shared likeness with [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref>Carlos Rojas, ''Salvador Dal<U+00ED>, or the Art of Spitting on Your Mother's Portrait'', [[Penn State University Press]], University Park, 1993, p.98. ISBN 0271008423</ref> Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] notes that Tzara, who agreed with [[Stalinism]] and shunned [[Trotskyism]], submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of [[socialist realism]].<ref name="iliv251">Livezeanu, p.251</ref> At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public.<ref>Livezeanu, p.247-249</ref> This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.<ref name="iliv251"/>

===World War II and Resistance===
During [[World War II]], Tzara took refuge from the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation forces]], moving to the southern areas, controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].<ref name="enotestt"/><ref name="jycmelusine"/> On one occasion, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] publication ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' made his whereabouts known to the [[Gestapo]].<ref name="mrnnradi">{{fr icon}} [http://www.marianne2.fr/Tristan-Tzara,-radical,-mondain-et-anticonformiste_a41229.html?PHPSESSID=c3682e2fb29f923d2fc35498af3a6907 "Tristan Tzara, radical, mondain et anticonformiste"], in ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'', [[January 13]], [[2003]]</ref> 

He was in [[Marseille]] in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat [[Varian Fry]], were seeking to escape [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. Among the people present there were the anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] socialist [[Victor Serge]], anthropologist [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]], playwright [[Arthur Adamov]], philosopher and poet [[Ren<U+00E9> Daumal]], and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and [[Benjamin P<U+00E9>ret]], as well as artists [[Max Ernst]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Masson]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Jacques H<U+00E9>rold]], [[Victor Brauner]] and [[<U+00D3>scar Dom<U+00ED>nguez]].<ref name="dgmarse">Dani<U+00E8>le Giraudy, Mus<U+00E9>e de Marseille (eds.), ''Le jeu de Marseille: autour d'Andr<U+00E9> Breton et des surr<U+00E9>alistes <U+00E0> Marseille en 1940-1941'', <U+00C9>ditions Alors Hors du Temps, Marseille, p.79sqq</ref> During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new [[card game]], on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.<ref name="dgmarse"/> 

Some time afterwar his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the [[French Resistance]], rallying with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. A collaborator to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the [[Free French Forces]] clandestine radio station.<ref name="enotestt"/><ref name="jycmelusine"/> He lived in [[Aix-en-Provence]], then in [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]], and ultimately in [[Toulouse]].<ref name="jycmelusine"/> His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the ''[[Franc Tireurs Partisans]]''.<ref name="mrnnradi"/> In [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-allied and antisemitic Romania, the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors (''see [[Romania during World War II]]'').<ref>[[Radu Ioanid]], "The Romanian Press: Preparing the Ground for the Holocaust and Reporting on Its Implementation", in Robert Moses Shapiro, ''Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and International Journalism during the Holocaust'', Ktav, Hoboken, 2003, p.404. ISBN 0881257753</ref> 

In December 1944, five months after the [[Liberation of Paris]], he was contributing to ''[[L'<U+00C9>ternelle Revue]]'', a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control.<ref name="srsmemor">Susan Rubin Suleiman, ''Crises of Memory and the Second World War'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.30-31.

Upon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.<ref name="enotestt"/> During 1945, under the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].<ref name="iliv246"/> According to Livezeanu, he "helped reclaim the [[Southern France|South]] from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France]."<ref name="iliv251"/> In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, <U+00C9>luard, Aragon and Dal<U+00ED>, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on [[Radio in Paris|Parisian Radio]].<ref>"Drop Everything, Drop Dado", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[April 8]], [[1946]]</ref> In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF<ref name="rcard530"/> (according to other sources, he had been one since 1934).<ref name="enotestt"/>

===International leftism===
Over the following decade, Tzara lend his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in [[primitivism]], he became a critic of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]'s [[French colonial empires|colonial policy]], and joined his voice to those who supported [[decolonization]].<ref name="spbuot"/> Nevertheless, he was appointed [[cultural ambassador]] of the Republic by the [[Paul Ramadier]] cabinet.<ref>Livezeanu, p.244, 246, 247</ref> He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike <U+00C9>luard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to [[socialist realism]].<ref name="mrnnradi"/>

In 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate [[Naz<U+0131>m Hikmet]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a ''[[cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre]]'' for the pro-Soviet public opinion.<ref>G<U+00F6>ksu & Timms, p.212, 318</ref><ref name="mcmusic">Mark Carroll, ''Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.52.

===1956 protest and final years===
[[Image:Tristan Tzara grave.jpg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re du Montparnasse]]]]
In October 1956, Tzara went visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="mrnnradi"/><ref name="jfapung"/> This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illy<U+00E9>s]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]]).<ref name="jfapung"/> Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],<ref name="mrnnradi"/><ref name="jfapung"/> contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kass<U+00E1>k]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement "revolutionary".<ref name="jfapung"/> However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as "an abstract notion".<ref name="jfapung"/> The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of "[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns."<ref name="jfapung"/> 

His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On [[October 24]], Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did.<ref name="jfapung"/> Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as "the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand."<ref name="jfapung"/> 

He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, and dedicated himself to researching the work of 15th century poet [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Villon]],<ref name="spbuot"/> and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], focused on promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years.<ref name="mrnnradi"/> In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him.<ref>"Battle of the Nihilists", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[April 8]], [[1957]]</ref> In August 1960, one year after the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] had been established by [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], at a time when French forces were confronting the [[Algeria]]n rebels (''see [[Algerian War]]''). Together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lindon]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and other intellectuals, he addressed [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Michel Debr<U+00E9>]] a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence.<ref name="laduras">[[Laure Adler]], ''Marguerite Duras: A Life'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2000, p.233-234.

In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]].<ref name="enotestt"/> One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the [[International Congress on African Culture]], organized by English curator [[Frank McEwen]] and held at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]].<ref>[[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], ''Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent'', [[Jacana Media]], 2007, p.227.

==Literary contributions==
===Identity issues===
Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialog, in which "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" was stimulated by "young emancipated Jewish writers."<ref>Cernat, p.34</ref> Salomon Schulman, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,<ref>Cernat, p.35-36</ref> while [[United States|American]] poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].<ref>Olson, p.40</ref> According to literary historian [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s."<ref name="gcal887">C<U+0103>linescu, p.887</ref>  

Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Z<U+00FC>nfte of Z<U+00FC>rich|Z<U+00FC>ntfhaus z<U+00FC>r Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.<ref name="pcern115"/> He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moar<U+0103> la H<U+00E2>r<U+0163>a'' ("At the Mill in H<U+00E2>r<U+0163>a") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.<ref>Cernat, p.182, 405</ref> Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by "the sweet language of [[Moldavia]]n peasants".<ref name="iliv246"/>

Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].<ref>Cernat, p.37-38</ref> Like in the cases of Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a "modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]" means of breaking with "the peripheral condition",<ref>Cernat, p.38</ref> which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.<ref name="pcern110"/> According to the same author, two important elements in this process were "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an "[[Oedipus complex]]" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].<ref>Cernat, p.18</ref> Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.<ref>Cernat, p.398, 403-405</ref> In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing [[nationalism]]s, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].<ref name="pcern115"/> The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates."<ref name="pcern115"/>

With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as "Orientals".<ref name="pcern112"/> [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, unlike his German collaborators.<ref>Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59</ref> According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a "[[Latin peoples|Latin]]" temperament.<ref name="pcern112"/> This type of perception also had negative implications for the Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of "[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was "a barbarian".<ref name="pcern114"/> In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.<ref>Cernat, p.114, 115</ref> 

At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of "literary anarchism".<ref>Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329</ref> Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his "formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.<ref>Cernat, p.310</ref> Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the "[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit", of the "foreign plague" and of "[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]".<ref>[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreapt<U+0103> rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>'', [[Editura Funda<U+0163>iei Culturale Rom<U+00E2>ne]], Bucharest, 1995, p.457. ISBN 973-9155-43-X</ref>

===Symbolist poetry===
Tzara's earliest [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist poems]], published in ''Simbolul'' during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked [[Sa<U+015F>a Pan<U+0103>]] not to include them in editions of his work.<ref name="pcern49"/> The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]].<ref>Cernat, p.49, 52</ref><ref name="enotestt"/><ref name="mrdada"/> Attached to Symbolist [[musicality]] at that stage, he was indebted to his ''Simbolul'' colleague [[Ion Minulescu]]<ref>Cernat, p.49; Emil Manu, "Actualitatea lui Ion Minulescu", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Versuri <U+015F>i proz<U+0103>'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1986, p.8. {{OCLC|18090790}}</ref> and the [[Belgium|Belgian]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].<ref name="pcern49"/> Philip Beitchman argues that "Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism<U+2014>and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends."<ref>Beitchman, p.27</ref> However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.<ref>Cernat, p.49, 52-53</ref>

During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the "hanged man" motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se sp<U+00E2>nzur<U+0103> un om'' ("A Man Hangs Himself"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].<ref name="pcern52">Cernat, p.52</ref> ''Se sp<U+00E2>nzur<U+0103> un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada sp<U+00E2>nzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Ballad") and Vinea (''Visul sp<U+00E2>nzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Dream"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective.<ref name="pcern52"/> These pieces also include ''Vacan<U+0163><U+0103> <U+00EE>n provincie'' ("Provincial Holiday") and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna <U+015F>i c<U+00E2>ntecul dezertorului'' ("The Storm and the Deserter's Song"), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''.<ref>Cernat, p.97-98, 106</ref> The series is seen by Cernat as "the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure."<ref>Cernat, p.98</ref> The complete text of ''Furtuna <U+015F>i c<U+00E2>ntecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pan<U+0103>.<ref>Cernat, p.106</ref> At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri <U+015F>i Proz<U+0103>]]'' (1915).<ref>Cernat, p.55</ref>

Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, "since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing."<ref name="pbeit29">Beitchman, p.29</ref> Cernat notes: "That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted."<ref>Cernat, p.54</ref> In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautr<U+00E9>amont]].<ref>Beitchman, p.38-39, 46</ref> According to Beitchman, Tzara's uses the Symbolist message that "the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back."<ref>Beitchman, p.52</ref>

===Collaboration with Vinea=== 
The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).<ref>Cernat, p.117, 119</ref>

In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.<ref>Cernat, p.109, 119, 160</ref> However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being "meditative and melancholic", while Tzara's is "[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]".<ref name="pcern117">Cernat, p.117</ref> Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.<ref>Cernat, p.117-119</ref> His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:

In his ''<U+00CE>nsereaz<U+0103>'' (roughly, "Night Falling"), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:

Cernat notes that ''Nocturn<U+0103>'' ("Nocturne") and ''<U+00CE>nsereaz<U+0103>'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as "Rumanian poetry",<!-- sic --> and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation.<ref>Cernat, p.111, 120</ref> Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse,<ref name="ddintoarc">{{ro icon}} [[Dennis Deletant]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-01-12&art=3373 "<U+00CE>ntoarcerea Rom<U+00E2>niei <U+00EE>n Europa: <U+00EE>ntre politic<U+0103> <U+015F>i cultur<U+0103>"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 879, January 2007</ref> Ball's diary entry of [[February 5]], [[1916]], indicates that Tzara's works were still "conservative in style".<ref name="hrich16">Richter, p.16</ref> In C<U+0103>linescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that "bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness."<ref name="gcal887"/> In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: "As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...]."<ref name="ddintoarc"/> 

Alongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves "crawl like worms" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees "heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals", or wind wailing "with all the hopelessness of an orphanage",<ref name="gcal887"/> Samyro's poetry includes ''Veri<U+015F>oar<U+0103>, fat<U+0103> de pension'', which, Cernat argues, displays "playful detachment [for] the musicality of [[internal rhyme]]s".<ref name="pcern49"/> It opens with the lyrics:

The [[G<U+00E2>rceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of "pure poetry", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Val<U+00E9>ry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.<ref>Cernat, p.153, 288</ref>

===Dada synthesis and "simultaneism"===
Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].<ref>Haftmann, in Richter, p.216</ref><ref name="mrnnradi"/> Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group.<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.396; Richter, p.19, 191 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.216-217)</ref> In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire<ref>Cardinal, p.529; Richter, p.167</ref> and Marinetti.<ref>Cardinal, p.529</ref> Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and [[black comedy]] writings of Romania's [[Urmuz]].<ref>Cernat, p.128-129, 343, 346; Amy D. Colin, "Paul Celan's Poetics of Destruction", in Amy D. Colin (ed.), ''Argumentum E Silentio'', [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 1987, p.158. ISBN 3110105551</ref><ref name="ddintoarc"/> 

For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as [[Tyrol]]ian peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[M<U+0101>ori language]].<ref>Cernat, p.113, 115</ref> Bernard Gendron describes these soir<U+00E9>es as marked by "heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]",<ref>Gendron, p.73</ref> and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].<ref>Richter, p.19</ref>

With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's "simultaneist poetry", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].<ref name="hrich16"/> Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was "the value of the human voice."<ref>Richter, p.31</ref> Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."<ref>Richter, p.30-31</ref> Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison <U+00E0> louer'' ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.<ref name="gcal887"/>

Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by "extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence".<ref name="rcard530"/> Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.396-397</ref> had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.887; Londr<U+00E9>, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123</ref><ref name="rlword">Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs'', [[University of Illinois Press]], Urbana & Chicago, p.45. ISBN 0252014138</ref><ref name="nzgysin"/>

===Dada and anti-art===
The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],<ref name="enotestt"/> and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", using "the language of a sophisticated savage".<ref name="rcard530"/> Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for "compress[ing] what we think and feel",<ref>Richter, p.103</ref> and, according to Hans Richter, the genre "suited Tzara perfectly."<ref name="hrich33"/> Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs.<ref>Richter, p.33-35</ref> His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: "Dada means nothing", adding "Thought is produced in the mouth."<ref>Londr<U+00E9>, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35</ref> Tzara indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."<ref name="jycmelusine"/> In addition, Tzara, who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",<ref name="ipuranus">{{ro icon}} Ion Pop, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X. Uranus"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 96, September 2006</ref> probably approved of Serner's vision of a "final dissolution".<ref>Richter, p.48, 49</ref> According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society."<ref name="pbeit29"/>

Despite adopting such anti-artistic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of "furthening the cause of art."<ref>Richter, p.54</ref> He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem "as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers", which included the lyrics:

''La Revue Dada 2'', which also includes the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] line ''tralalalalalalalalalalala'', is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves.<ref>Richter, p.54</ref> This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that "Man is in search of a new language."<ref name="mlsconcr">Mary Lewis Shaw, "Concrete and Abstract Poetry: The World as Text and the Text as World", in Leonard M. Trawick (ed.), ''World, Self, Poem: Essays on Contemporary Poetry from the "Jubliation of Poets"'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1990, p.169. ISBN 0873384199</ref> C<U+0103>linescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to "shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]".<ref name="gcal887"/> Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.<ref name="hrich123"/>

The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts.<ref name="enotestt"/> Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le g<U+00E9>ant blanc l<U+00E9>preux du paysage'' ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the "skinny, idiotic, dirty" reader who "does not understand my poetry."<ref name="enotestt"/> He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures.<ref>Cardinal, p.530; Hofman, p.7</ref> The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became "destruction of the word for nothing".<ref name="dwslettr">David W. Seaman, "French Lettrisme<U+2014>Discontinuity and the Nature of the Avant-Garde", in Freeman G. Henry (ed.), ''Discontinuity and Fragmentation'', [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]], Amsterdam, 1994, p.163. ISBN 9051836341</ref> According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an "internal order", and read as "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious."<ref name="enotestt"/>

===Plays of the 1920s===
Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> gaz]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what theater critic Enoch Brater calls a "peculiar verbal strategy", it is the dialog between characters named Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.<ref name="ebra25">Brater, p.25</ref> They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other, and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.<ref name="ebra25"/> The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]], and its correspondent in the text culminates in a series of illegible words and doodles.<ref name="ebra26">Brater, p.26</ref> Brater includes ''Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> gaz'' among the "parodies of theatrical conventions".<ref name="ebra26"/> 

In his 1924 play ''[[Mouchoir de nuages]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose characteristic traits borrow the clich<U+00E9>s of conventional theater), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>Beitchman, p.31-32</ref> Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Mouchoir de Nuages'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names, and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the main protagonist, who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.<ref>Beitchman, p.32-34</ref> Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a "privileged position for art": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.<ref>Beitchman, p.34-35</ref>

===''L'Homme approximatif'' and later works===
After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].<ref name="enotestt"/> According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from "a studied inconsequentiality" and "unreadable gibberish" to "a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom."<ref name="rcard530"/> The critic also remarks: "Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision."<ref name="rcard530"/>

This is in particular the case of ''[[L'Homme approximatif]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].<ref name="rcard530"/><ref name="enotestt"/> While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.<ref>Beitchman, p.37-42</ref><ref name="enotestt"/> Cardinal calls the piece "an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty",<ref name="rcard530"/> while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the "excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.<ref>Beitchman, p.37-38</ref> The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.<ref>Beitchman, p.40-45</ref> One of the appeals in the text reads:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul
je ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi
un bruit glac<U+00E9> froiss<U+00E9> au carrefour jet<U+00E9> sur le trottoir humide
aux pieds des hommes press<U+00E9>s courant avec leurs morts
autour de la mort qui <U+00E9>tend ses bras
sur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.<ref name="jycmelusine"/>
</poem>

<poem>
I speak about who speaks who speaks I am alone
I am not that a small noise I have several noises in me
a ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement
with the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead
around death which extends its arms
on the dial of the hour only alive in the sun
</poem>
|
|}

The next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.<ref name="pbeit49"/><ref name="enotestt"/> The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as "fascinating",<ref>Beitchman, p.45</ref> was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''L'Homme approximatif'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.<ref>Beitchman, p.46-50</ref> People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.<ref>Beitchman, p.48</ref> ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.<ref>Beitchman, p.51</ref>

Cardinal notes: "In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along."<ref name="rcard530"/> The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.<ref name="enotestt"/> In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.<ref name="enotestt"/> He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Villon]], whom he deeply admired.<ref name="spbuot"/><ref name="mrnnradi"/>

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Beside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by ''[[unu (magazine)|unu]]''<!-- sic --> magazine, written by writer [[Sa<U+015F>a Pan<U+0103>]] and [[Moldov]], cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as artists [[Constantin Brancusi]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.889</ref> One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was [[Jacques G. Costin]], who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and [[Futurism]].<ref>Cernat, p.174, 193, 409</ref> ''[[Mouchoir de Nuages]]'' was notably praised by [[Ion C<U+0103>lug<U+0103>ru]] and his fellow theater chroniclers at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist theater could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.<ref name="pcern277"/> The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and Surrealist author [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art.<ref name="ipuranus"/> Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were [[Poland|Polish]] Futurist writer [[Bruno Jasie<U+0144>ski]],<ref>Nina Kolesnikoff, ''Bruno Jasie<U+0144>ski: His Evolution from Futurism to Socialist Realism'', [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], Waterloo, 1982, p.15.

ISBN 0804711666</ref> and [[Chile]]an poet and Dadaist sympathizer [[Vicente Huidobro]], who cited him as a precursor for his own ''[[Creacionismo]]''.<ref>{{es icon}} [[Vicente Huidobro]], [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/manifiesto1.htm ''El Creacionismo''], at the [[University of Chile]] [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ Vicente Huidobro site]; retrieved [[May 4]], [[2008]]</ref>

An immediate precursor of [[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdism]], he was acknowledged as a mentor by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]], who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.<ref>Rosette C. Lamont, ''Ionesco's Imperatives: The Politics of Culture'', [[University of Michigan Press]], Ann Arbor, 1993, p.4. ISBN 0472103105</ref> Tzara's style had an impact on the writings of [[Samuel Beckett]], in particular on his poetry (part of which he translated into English),<ref name="dbgodot"/> and Beckett's 1972 play ''[[Not I]]'' shares some elements with ''[[Le C<U+0153>ur <U+00E0> gaz]]''.<ref>Brater, p.25-26</ref> In the [[United States]], the Romanian author is cited as an influence on [[Beat Generation]] members. Beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]], who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and [[William S. Burroughs]].<ref>Josef Ja<U+0159>ab, "When All Met Together in One Room: Josef Ja<U+0159>ab Interviews Allen Ginsberg", in Heather Hathaway, Josef Ja<U+0159>ab, Jeffrey Melnick (eds.), ''Race and the Modern Artist'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, p.242-243. ISBN 0195123247</ref> The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the [[cut-up technique]], adopted by [[Brion Gysin]] and Burroughs himself.<ref name="rlword"/> Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were "going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a "Communist Party bureaucrat".<ref name="nzgysin"/>

Among the late 20th century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are [[Jerome Rothenberg]],<ref name="camroth">Christine A. Meilick, ''Jerome Rothenberg's Experimental Poetry and Jewish Tradition'', [[Lehigh University Press]], Bethlehem, 2005, p.46-47, 85sqq. ISBN 0934223769</ref> [[Isidore Isou]] and [[Andrei Codrescu]]. The former [[Situationist International|Situationist]] Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come in succession to Apollinaire and Dada,<ref name="mlsconcr"/> declared his [[Lettrism]] to be the last connection in the [[Charles Baudelaire]]-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging "a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote."<ref name="dwslettr"/> For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name ''Tristan Tzara''.<ref>Noemi Marin, "The Rhetoric of Andrei Codrescu: A Reading in Exilic Fragmentation", in Domnica R<U+0103>dulescu (ed.), ''Realms of Exile: Nomadism, Diasporas, and Eastern European Voices'', Lexington Books, New York, p.102. ISBN 0-7391-0333-4</ref>

In retrospect, various authors describe Tzara's Dadaist shows and street performances as "[[happening]]s", with a word employed by post-Dadaists and Situationists, which was coined in the 1950s.<ref>Beitchman, p.44; Londr<U+00E9>, p.397</ref> Some also credit Tzara with having provided an ideological source for the development of [[rock music]], including [[punk rock]], [[punk subculture]] and [[post-punk]].<ref>Beitchman, p.36; Thomas McLaughlin, ''Street Smarts and Critical Theory: Listening to the Vernacular'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, 1997, p.67.

===Tributes and portrayals===
In France, Tzara's work was collected as ''Oevres compl<U+00E8>tes'' ("Complete Works"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975,<ref name="rcard530"/> and an international poetry award is named after him (''Prix International de Po<U+00E9>sie Tristan Tzara''). An international periodical titled ''Caietele Tristan Tzara'', edited by the Tristan Tzara Cultural-Literary Foundation, has been published in [[Moine<U+015F>ti]] since 1998.<ref name="ocprofesor">{{ro icon}} Olti<U+0163>a C<U+00EE>ntec, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-profesor-inimos-din.html "Un profesor inimos din Moine<U+015F>ti <U+015F>i o societate cultural-literar<U+0103> atrag aten<U+0163>ia <U+00EE>ntregii lumii asupra Rom<U+00E2>niei"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', [[March 10]], [[2003]]</ref><ref>{{ro icon}} Oana T<U+0103>nase, [http://observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=9425&print=true "Pic Adrian: artist esen<U+0163>ialist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 189, October 2003</ref>

According to Paul Cernat, ''Aliluia'', one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a "transparent allusion" to Tristan Tzara.<ref>Cernat, p.181</ref> Vinea's fragment speaks of "the [[Wandering Jew]]", a character whom people notice because he sings ''La moar<U+0103> la H<U+00E2>r<U+0163>a'', "a suspicious song from [[Greater Romania]]."<ref>Cernat, p.181-182</ref> The poet is a character in [[India]]n novelist [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s ''Thieves of Fire'', part four of his ''The Bubble'' (1984),<ref>Suresh Chandra, ''Fresh Perspectives on Fiction'', Anmol Publications, New Delhi, 2005, p.78.

Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with the [[Gertrude Stein]]'s controversial memoir. One of his performances is enthusiastically recorded by [[Malcolm Cowley]] in his autobiographical book of 1934, ''Exile's Return'',<ref>"Lost Generation", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[June 4]], [[1934]]</ref> and he is also mentioned in [[Harold Loeb]]'s memoir ''The Way It Was''.<ref>"The Sun Also Rises (Contd.)", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[June 22]], [[1959]]</ref> Among his biographers is the French author Fran<U+00E7>ois Buot, who records some of the lesser-known aspects of Tzara's life.<ref name="spbuot"/> At some point between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is believed to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].<ref>[[J.

Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. [[Max Ernst]] depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait ''Au Rendez-vous des Amis'' ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922),<ref name="spbuot"/> while, in one of [[Man Ray]]'s photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an [[androgynous]] [[Nancy Cunard]].<ref>Maureen Moynagh, introduction to [[Nancy Cunard]], ''Essays on Race and Empire'', Broadview Press, Peterborough & Orchard Park, p.24.

In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps a steel, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moine<U+015F>ti.<ref name="ocprofesor"/>

Several of Tzara's Dadaist editions had illustrations by Picabia, Janco and [[Hans Arp]].<ref name="imjbokks"/> In its 1925 edition, ''Mouchoir de Nuages'' featured etchings by [[Juan Gris]], while his late writings ''Parler seul'', ''Le Signe de vie'', ''De m<U+00E9>moire d'homme'', ''Le Temps naissant'', and ''Le Fruit permis'' were illustrated with works by, respectively, [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>]],<ref>Jacques Lassaigne, ''Mir<U+00F3>: Biographical and Critical Study'', SKIRA, New York, 1963, p.128</ref> [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Nejad Devrim]]<ref name="imjbokks"/> and [[Sonia Delaunay]].<ref>[http://www.kb.nl/bc/koopman/1951-1960/c06-en.html ''Le fruit permis''], at the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|National Library of the Netherlands]]'s [http://www.kb.nl/bc/koopman/ Koopman Collectie]; retrieved [[April 26]], [[2008]]</ref> Tzara was the subject of an 1949 eponymous [[documentary film]] directed by the [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[J<U+00F8>rgen Roos]], and footage of him featured prominently in the 1953 production ''Les statues meurent aussi'' ("Statues Also Die"), jointly directed by [[Chris Marker]] and [[Alain Resnais]].<ref name="ttzimdb"/>

===Posthumous controversies===
The many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by "petty jealosies".<ref name="hrich32"/> 

In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[G<U+00E2>rceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.<ref>Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409</ref> In 1931, the young and modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Brancusi]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, p.331</ref> [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]] argued that "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.<ref>Cernat, p.367</ref> Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).<ref>Cernat, p.110, 367-368</ref> 

A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a "[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]".<ref name="pcern113">Cernat, p.113</ref> Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an "illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon", and denounced him as "the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature."<ref name="pcern113"/> Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]].

From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly-adopted emphasis on [[Nationalism|nationalist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to "[[protochronism]]", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, alongside Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou, as representatives of "Romanian initiatives" and "road openers at a universal level."<ref>Cernat, p.359</ref> Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.<ref>Cernat, p.129</ref>
