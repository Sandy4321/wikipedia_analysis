'''Palermo''' ({{IPA-it|pa<U+02C8>l<U+025B>rmo|lang|It-Palermo.ogg}}, [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: ''Palermu'', {{lang-la|Panormus}}, from {{lang-el|<U+03A0><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''Panormos'', {{lang-ar|<U+0628><U+064E><U+0644><U+064E><U+0631><U+0652><U+0645>}}, ''Balarm''; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: <U+05D6><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05D6>, ''Ziz'') is a city in [[Insular Italy]], the [[capital (political)|capital]] of both the [[autonomous area|autonomous region]] of [[Sicily]] and the [[Province of Palermo]]. The city is noted for its [[history]], [[culture]], [[architecture]] and [[gastronomy]], playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700&nbsp;years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

First settled by various Greek tribes, the city was founded in 734&nbsp;BC by the [[Phoenicia]]ns as ''Ziz''. The present name is derived from the Greek ''Panoremus'' meaning 'always fit for landing in'. Palermo then became part of the [[Roman Republic]], the Roman Empire and eventually part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], for over a thousand years. From 831 to 1072 it was under [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Arab rule]] during the [[Emirate of Sicily]] when it first became a capital. Following the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman reconquest]], Palermo became capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Eventually it would be united with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] until the [[Italian unification]] of 1860.

The population of Palermo [[Larger Urban Zones|urban area]] is estimated by [[Eurostat]] to be 855,285, while its [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe by population|metropolitan area]] is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2&nbsp;million people. In the central area, the city has a population of around 650,000 people. The inhabitants are known as Palermitans or, poetically, ''panormiti''. The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the [[Italian language]] and the [[Sicilian language]], in its Palermitan variation.

Palermo is Sicily's [[culture|cultural]], [[economy|economic]] and [[tourism|touristic]] capital. It is a city rich in [[history]], [[culture]], [[art]], [[music]] and [[food]]. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good [[Mediterranean]] weather, its renowned [[gastronomy]] and [[restaurant]]s, its [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] [[church (building)|church]]es, [[palace]]s and [[building]]s, and its [[nightlife]] and [[music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicilianculture.com/travel/palermo.htm |title=Travel: Palermo, Sicily |publisher=Sicilian Culture |date=2002-03-09 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> Palermo is the main Sicilian [[industry|industrial]] and [[commerce|commercial]] center: the main industrial sectors include [[tourism]], [[service (economics)|services]], [[commerce]] and [[agriculture]].<ref name="bcglocations.com">{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/Europe/Italy/Palermo |title=The Sunday Times guide: Palermo |publisher=Bcg.thetimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> Palermo currently has an [[Palermo Airport|international airport]], and a significant [[underground economy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
In fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the [[Mediterranean]] and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe. The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area.<ref>[http://www.pianostrategico.comune.palermo.it/index php Capital dell'euromediterraneo for redevelopment, development and promotion of the metropolitan area of Palermo]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>

[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is highly important in Palermitan culture. The [[patron saint]] of the city is [[Saint Rosalia]]. Her [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on July 15 is perhaps the biggest social event in the city. The area attracts significant numbers of [[tourism|tourists]] each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish [[market]] at the heart of Palermo, known as the ''Vucciria''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/travel/20journeys.html|publisher=NYTimes.com|title=In Palermo, Life Vibrates in a Fading Market|date=8 January 2008 | first=Danielle | last=Pergament | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Evidence for [[Colonisation|human settlement]] in the area now known as Palermo goes back at least to the [[Mesolithic]] period, perhaps around [[8th millennium BC|8000&nbsp;BC]], when a group of cave drawings at nearby Addaura represent a new level in the representation of the human figure.<ref>Sandars, Nancy K., ''Prehistoric Art in Europe'', Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), 1968 (nb 1st edn.), pp. 85-86</ref>  According to [[Thucydides]], the [[Sicani]] people arrived from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (perhaps [[Catalonia]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Sicily_-_History/id/5462681|publisher=Experience Festival|title=Sicily: Encyclopedia II <U+2013> Sicily <U+2013> History|date=7 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A7kGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=segre+sicano|publisher=Ensayo historico|title=Aapologetico de la literatura espa<U+00F1>ola contra los opiniones|date=7 October 2007}}</ref> During 734&nbsp;BC the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a sea trading peoples from the north of ancient [[Canaan]], built a small settlement on the natural habour of Palermo.

As the [[Roman Empire]] was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. The first were the [[Vandals]] in 440&nbsp;AD under the rule of their king [[Geiseric]].

After the Byzantines were betrayed by Admiral [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Euphemius]], who fled to [[Tunisia]] and begged the [[Aghlabid]] leader [[Ziyadat Allah I of Aghlabids|Ziyadat Allah]] to help him, there was a [[Muslim]] conquest of Sicily in 831, which took until 904 against fierce resistance. The [[Emirate of Sicily]] was established.<ref name = "stan"/> The Muslims rule within the whole island lasted for about 120&nbsp;years. Palermo (Balarm during Arab rule) displaced Syracuse as the prime city of Sicily.

Sicily, in 1194, fell under the control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. Muslims of Palermo emigrated and were and expelled during Holy Roman rule. After an interval of [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule (1266<U+2013>1282), Sicily came under control of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] dynasty. By 1330, Palermo's population had declined to 51,000.<ref name=Long>{{Cite journal|title=Princes and Merchants: European City Growth before the Industrial Revolution|author=J.

Palermo was also managed by [[Savoy]] between 1713 and 1717 and 1718<U+2013>1720 as result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. And by [[Austria]] between 1720 and 1734.

===Two Sicilies===
After the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), Sicily was handed over to the [[House of Savoy|Savoia]], but by 1734 it was again a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] possession. [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] chose Palermo for his coronation as [[King of Sicily]]. Charles had new houses built for the increased population, while trade and industry grew as well. However, Palermo was now just another provincial city as the royal court resided in Naples. Charles' son [[Ferdinand I of Two Sicilies|Ferdinand]], though disliked by the population, took refuge in Palermo after the [[French Revolution]] in 1798. His son [[Prince Alberto of Naples and Sicily|Alberto]] died on the way to Palermo and is buried in the city.

[[File:Sanesi - La rivoluzione di Palermo-12 gennaio 1848 - ca. 1850.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The revolution in Palermo (12 January 1848).]]
From 1820 to 1848 all Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on January 12, 1848, with a popular insurrection, the first one in Europe that year, led by [[Giuseppe La Masa]]. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was [[Ruggero Settimo]]. The Bourbons soon reconquered Palermo (May 1849), which remained under their rule until the appearance of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. This famous general entered Palermo with his troops (the <U+201C>Thousands<U+201D>) on May 27, 1860. After the [[plebiscite]] later that year Palermo and the whole of Sicily became part of the new [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] (1861).

===Italian unification and today===
From that year onwards, Palermo followed the history of [[Italy]] as the administrative centre of [[Sicily]]. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by more families, like the [[Florio]], the Ducrot, the [[Rutelli]], the [[Sandron]], the Whitaker, the [[Utveggio]], and other families. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards, the ''Via Roma'', ''Via Dante'', ''Via Notarbartolo'', and ''Viale della Libert<U+00E0>''. This roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the [[Art Nouveau]] style or ''Stile Liberty'' as it is known in Italy. Many of these were designed by the famous architect [[Ernesto Basile]]. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by [[Ernesto Basile]] for the [[Florio]] family, is a good example of Palermitan [[Art Nouveau|Liberty Style]]. The very large [[Teatro Massimo]] was designed in the same period by [[Giovan Battista Filippo Basile]], and built by the Rutelli & Mach<U+00EC> building firm of the industrial and old [[Rutelli]] Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.

During World War II, Palermo was untouched until the Allies began to advance up Italy after the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in 1943. In July, the harbour and the surrounding quarters were heavily bombed by the allied forces and were all but destroyed. Six decades later the city centre has still not been fully rebuilt, and hollow walls and devastated buildings can still be found.

In 1946 the city was declared the seat of the [[Sicilian Regional Assembly|Regional Parliament]], as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]]. Palermo's future seemed to look bright again. Many opportunities were lost in the coming decades, owing to incompetence, incapacity, [[political|corruption]] and [[abuse of power]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

The main topic of the modern age is the struggle against the [[Mafia]] and bandits like [[Salvatore Giuliano]], who controlled the neighbouring area of [[Montelepre]]. The Italian State had to share effective control of the territory, economic as well as administrative, with the Mafia families.

The so-called "[[Sack of Palermo]]" is one of the major visible faces of this problem. The term is used today to indicate the heavy building speculations that filled the city with poor buildings. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy had led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size. Instead of rebuilding the city centre the town was thrown into a frantic expansion towards the north, where practically a new town was built. The regulatory plan for the expansion was largely ignored. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city. The Mafia played a huge role in this process, which was an important element in the Mafia's transition from a mostly rural phenomenon into a modern criminal organisation. The Mafia took advantage of corrupt city officials (a former mayor of Palermo, [[Vito Ciancimino]], has been condemned for his bribery with Mafiosi) and protection coming from the Italian central government itself.

Many civil servants lost their lives in the struggle against the criminal organisations of Palermo and Sicily. These include the [[Carabinieri]] general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]], the region<U+2019>s president [[Piersanti Mattarella]], Padre [[Pino Puglisi]], a priest who had fought for the young people living in the suburbs, and courageous magistrates such as [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]].

Palermo is connected to the mainland by an international airport and an increasing number of maritime links. However, land connections remain poor. This and other reasons have until now thwarted the development of tourism. This has been identified as the main resource to exploit for the city's recovery, the legacy of three millennia of history and folklore.

===Climate===
Palermo experiences a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''). Winters are mild and wet, while Summers are warm to hot, and dry. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual ambient air temperature of {{convert|18.5|<U+00B0>C|1|abbr=on}}. It receives approximately 2,530&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year. Snow is rare but not impossible. In the late 40's and in the early 2000s it snowed as far as the harbour eight times. More often snow stopped on the edge of the city.

The average annual temperature of the sea is above {{convert|19|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}}, from {{convert|14|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}} in February to {{convert|26|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}} in August. In the period from May to November, the average sea temperature exceeds {{convert|18|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}} and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds {{convert|21|<U+00B0>C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="weather2travel">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/italy/sicily/palermo.php |title=Palermo Climate Guide |accessdate=}}</ref>

Palermo has a large architectural heritage and is notable for its many [[Norman architecture|Norman buildings]].

===Churches===
[[File:0482 - Palermo - Cattedrale - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 28-Sept-2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palermo Cathedral]].]]

[[File:Palermo-San-Cataldo-bjs-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo's Church]].]]

[[File:Palermo-Martorana-bjs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martorana|Chiesa della Martorana]]]]

*[[Palermo Cathedral]] is the city's cathedral and main church. It is characterized by the presence of different architectural styles, due to a long history of additions, alterations and restorations, the last of which occurred in the 18th century. The cathedral is located at Corso Vittorio Emanuele, corner of Via Matteo Bonello, Palermo.
*[[San Giovanni dei Lebbrosi]]
*[[San Giovanni degli Eremiti]] (St. John of the Hermits) is a church near the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]]. The church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century. In his ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', F. Elliot described it as "...&nbsp;totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]". The bell tower, with four orders of arcaded loggias, is, instead, a typical example of [[Gothic architecture]].
*[[Martorana|Chiesa della Martorana]], also known as ''Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio'' (''Saint Mary of the Admiral''), is annexed to the next-door church of [[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]] and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original church was built in the form of a compact [[cross-in-square]] ("Greek cross plan"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variation on the standard middle Byzantine church type. The three apses in the east adjoin directly on the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in contemporary Byzantine architecture in the Balkans and Asia Minor.<ref>Kitzinger, ''Mosaics'', 29<U+2013>30.</ref> In the first century of its existence the church was expanded in three distinct phases; first through the addition of a [[narthex]] to house the tombs of George of Antioch and his wife; next through the addition of a forehall; and finally through the construction of a centrally-aligned [[campanile]] at the west. The campanile, which is richly decorated with three orders of arches and lodges with mullioned windows, still serves as the main entrance to the church. Significant later additions to the church include the [[Baroque]] fa<U+00E7>ade which today faces onto the piazza. In the late 19th century, historically-minded restorers attempted to return the church to its original state, although many elements of the Baroque modifications remain.<ref>Kitzinger, ''Mosaics'', 42ff.</ref>

*[[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]] is a church building on the central Piazza Bellini. It is a notable example of [[Norman architecture]]. The church is annexed to that of [[Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio]].
*[[Santa Maria della Gancia]]
*[[Santa Maria della Catena]] was built in 1490<U+2013>1520, designed by [[Matteo Carnilivari]]. The name derives from the presence, on one of the walls, of a chain (Italian: ''[[:wiktionary:catena|catena]]'') which closed the Cala port.
*[[San Giuseppe dei Teatini]] is a Baroque church located near the [[Quattro Canti]], and is considered one of the most outstanding examples of the [[Sicilian Baroque]] in Palermo
*[[Oratorio di San Lorenzo, Palermo|Oratorio di San Lorenzo]]
*[[Oratorio del Rosario, Palermo|Oratorio del Rosario]]
*Santa Teresa alla [[Kalsa]] derives its name from [[Al-Khalisa]], an [[Arabic language|Arab]] term meaning ''elected''. The church, constructed in 1686<U+2013>1706 over the former emir's residence, is one of the most outstanding examples of [[Sicilian Baroque]]. It has a single, airy nave, with stucco decorations from the early 18th century.
*[[Santa Maria dello Spasimo]] was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. For this temple [[Raphael]] painted his famous ''[[Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary (Raphael)|Sicilia's Spasimo]]'', now in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]]. The church today is a fascinating open-air, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.
*the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Jesus]] (''Chiesa del Ges<U+00F9>'') was built by the Jesuits in the centre of the city in 1564, over a pre-existing convent of [[Basilian monk]]s. The edifice was further enlarged starting in 1591, becoming one of the most relevant examples of [[Sicilian Baroque]], though retaining some severe late Renaissance fashion. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the [[fresco]]es. The interior has a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] plan with a nave and two aisles, characterized by a particularly rich decoration of marbles, tarsias and stuccoes, especially in the [[Saint Anne|St. Anne's]] Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The Church of the Jesus is home to the Municipal Library, placed here in 1775.
*The church of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] was erected between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city. It was built at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the latter after an [[earthquake]]. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Mediaeval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa<U+00E7>ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by [[Antonello Gagini|Antonio]] and [[Giacomo Gagini]] and [[Francesco Laurana]], plus a noteworthy wooden choir dating from the 16th century. Of note are also the allegorical statues by Giacomo Serpotta (1723), also author of the stucco decoration.
*The church of the Magione (officially church of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]), an ancient example of Norman architecture, was founded in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]]

===Palaces and museums===
[[File:Palermo-Castle-bjs-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo dei Normanni]], seat of the Sicilian Regional Assembly.]]
[[File:Sicilia Palermo1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|left|Piazza Pretoria.]]
*[[Palazzo dei Normanni]], one of the most beautiful Italian palaces and a notable example of [[Norman architecture]], probably built over an Arab fortress. It houses the famous [[Cappella Palatina]].
*[[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] (1160) and [[Cuba, Palermo|Cuba]], magnificent castles/houses used by the kings of Palermo for hunting. Similar buildings were common in northern Africa, but today these two are the only ones remaining. The Zisa houses the Islamic museum. The Cuba was once encircled by water.
*[[Palazzo Chiaramonte]]
*[[Palazzo Abatellis]], with the Regional Gallery. It was built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical [[Gothic architecture|Catalan Gothic]] style, with [[Renaissance]] influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by [[Francesco Laurana]] (1471) and the ''Malvagna Triptych'' (c. 1510), by [[Jan Mabuse|Jan Gossaert]] and the famous ''Annunziata'' by [[Antonello da Messina]]. The exposition in the museum has been designed by the architect [[Carlo Scarpa]].
*The [[Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas]] is one the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] civilizations. It houses all the decorative parts from the Sicilian temples of [[Segesta]] and [[Selinunte]].

===City Walls===
Palermo has at least 2 circuits of City Walls - many pieces of which still survive. The first circuit surrounded the ancient core of the punic City - the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova)  and the Neopolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road E-W through this early walled City. The eastern edge of the walled City was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porto Nuovo.
[[File:Palermo corso alberto feb 12 2347.jpg|thumb|right|City Wall at Corso Alberto]]
[[File:Palermo City Wall via del bastione feb 12 .jpg|thumb|right|City Wall at Via Del Bastione]]

In the medieval period the wall circuit was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road E-W through the walled City. West gate was still Porta Nuova, the circuit continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this North East corner there was a defense, [[Castello a Mare]], to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at S Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porta Nuova. Source: Palermo - City Guide by Adriana Chirco, 1998, Dario Flaccovio Editore.

Several gates in the City Wall survive.

===Opera houses===
[[File:Palermo-Teatro-Massimo-bjs2007-02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Teatro Massimo]] opera house.]]
[[File:Palermo-Politeama-bjs-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Politeama]] theatre.]]
*The [[Teatro Massimo]] ("Greatest Theatre") was opened in 1897. It is the biggest in Italy, and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Op<U+00E9>ra National de Paris and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna), renowned for its perfect acoustics. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now carefully restored and has an active schedule. [[Enrico Caruso]] sang in a performance of ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' during the opening season, returning for ''[[Rigoletto]]'' at the very end of his career. It is the largest theater in Italy and the third largest in Europe (8000 sm) .
*The [[Teatro Politeama]] was built between 1867 and 1874

===Squares===
*[[Quattro Canti]] is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele]] and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (''[[mandamento|mandamenti]]''). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa<U+00E7>ades so that the square gets an almost octagonal form.
*Piazza Pretoria was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by [[Francesco Camilliani]], the Fontana Pretoria

===Other sights===

[[File:Palerm - Quattro Canti.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Quattro Canti]] at [[Christmas]] time.]]
The cathedral has a [[heliometer]] (solar "observatory") of 1690, one of a number<ref name="ref1">{{cite web|url=http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |title=A paper from University of Bologna describing Heliometers in Italian Cathedrals |publisher=Cis.alma.unibo.it |date=1995-12-06 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as [[Pinhole camera]], projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at [[noon|solar noon]] (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, ''[[Meridian (astronomy)|la Meridiana]] '' on the floor, running precisely N/S. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; [[zodiac|signs of the zodiac]] show the various other dates throughout the year.

The purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of [[time in physics|time]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|calendar]]. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24&nbsp;hour) day was measured from the moment of sun-rise, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. It was also important to know when the [[Equinox|Vernal Equinox]] occurred, to provide the correct date for [[Easter]].

The [[Orto botanico di Palermo]], founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of 10 ha.

One site of interest is the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[Capuchin catacombs of Palermo|Catacombs]], with many [[mummy|mummified]] [[Cadaver|corpse]]s in varying degrees of preservation.

Close to the city is the 600&nbsp;m-high Monte Pellegrino, offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.

In 2010, there were 655,875 people residing in Palermo, of which 1.2&nbsp;million live in the greater Palermo area, and of whom 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female. People under age 15 totalled 15.6%  of the population compared to pensioners who number 17.2. This compares with the Italian average of 14.1% (people under age 15) and 20.2% pensioners. The average age of Palermo resident is 40.4 compared to the Italian average of 42.8. In the ten years between 2001 and 2010, the population of Palermo declined by 4.5%, while the population of Italy, as a whole, grew by 6.0%. The reason for Palermo's decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and to [[Northern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/ |title=Informazioni, CAP e dati utili |publisher=Comuni-Italiani.it |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The current [[birth rate]] of Palermo is 10.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.3 births.

As of 2006, 97.79% of the population was of [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]]/[[Italians|Italian]] descent. The largest immigrant group came from [[South Asia]] (mostly from [[Sri Lanka]]): 0.80%, other European countries (mostly from [[Albania]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Ukraine]], ): 0.3%, and North Africa (mostly from [[Tunisia]]): 0.28%.<ref>http://demo.istat.it/str2006/dati/Palermo.zip</ref>

==Economy==
Being Sicily's administrative capital, Palermo is home to much of the region's main [[economy|economic]], [[finance|financial]], [[tourism|touristic]] and [[commerce|commercial]] life. The city currently hosts an [[Palermo Airport|international airport]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palermo-pmo.airports-guides.com/ |title=Palermo Falcone Borsellino Airport (PMO) Information: Airport in Punta Raisi Area, Italy |publisher=Palermo-pmo.airports-guides.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> and Palermo's [[economic growth]] over the years has brought to the opening of many new [[business]]es and [[entrepreneur]]ial opportunities. The economy mainly relies on [[tourism]] and [[service (economics)|services]], but also [[commerce]], [[shipbuilding]], [[trade]] and [[agriculture]].<ref name="bcglocations.com"/> The city, however, still has high [[unemployment]] levels, high corruption and a significant [[black market]] empire (Palermo being the home of the [[Sicilian Mafia]]). Even though the city still suffers from widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], inefficient [[bureaucracy]] and [[organized crime]] ([[Mafia]]), Palermo's crime level has gone down dramatically, [[unemployment]] has been decreasing and many new, profitable, strategies (especially regarding [[tourism]]) have been introduced, making the city safer and better to live in.<ref name="bcglocations.com"/>

==Education==
The local university is the [[University of Palermo]], the island's second oldest university. It was officially founded in 1806, although historical records indicate that medicine and law have been taught there since the late 15th century. The [[Orto botanico di Palermo]] (Palermo botanical gardens) is home to the university's Department of Botany and is also open to visitors.

==Sports==
Palermo has a professional [[football team]], [[U.S. Citt<U+00E0> di Palermo]], who compete in [[Serie B]]. The chairman is [[Maurizio Zamparini]] and the coach is [[Beppe Iachini]].

The [[Targa Florio]] was an open road endurance car race held near Palermo. Founded in 1906, it used to be one of the oldest [[sports car racing]] events until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns but has since run as a rallying event. Palermo was home to the grand depart of the 2008  [[Giro d'Italia]]. The initial stage was a {{convert|28.5|km|1|abbr=on}} long TTT ([[Team time trial|Team Time Trial]]) held on May 10.

[[Internazionali Femminili di Palermo]] is a [[WTA Tour]] Tier IV tournament in Palermo.

==Infrastructure==

===Public transportation===
Palermo has [[commuter rail]] called [[Palermo metropolitan railway service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subways.net/italy/palermo.htm |title=Palermo Subway Metro Light Rail |publisher=Subways.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref>

Palermo's public bus system is operated by [http://www.amat.pa.it/ AMAT] and it develops a net of {{convert|340|km|0|abbr=on}} divided by about 90 lines reaching every zone of the town.<ref>See {{it icon}} [http://www.amat.pa.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=88 Transport net by AMAT]</ref>

The [http://www.aziendasicilianatrasporti.it/ AST], with its [[Coach (bus)|coachs]] divided in 35 lines, links Palermo to all the cities of [[provincia di Palermo]] and the main in Sicily.

===Roads===
Palermo is a key node for the sicilian road network, being the junction between east [[Autostrada A19 (Italy)|A19]] [[highway]] to [[Trapani]], the south-east [[Autostrada A29 (Italy)|A29]] to [[Palermo International Airport|airport]] and [[Mazzara del Vallo]] and the south-west [[Autostrada A19 (Italy)|A19]] to [[Messina]] and [[Autostrada A20 (Italy)|A20]] to [[Catania]]. Palermo is one of the main city on the [[european route E90]]. Other national roads link Palermo to every place in Sicily.<ref>The three main national road starting from Palermo are the SS113, SS121, SS186 and the SS624.</ref>

===Airports===
[[Palermo International Airport]], also known as [[Palermo International Airport|Falcone-Borsellino Airport]], [[Palermo International Airport|Punta Raisi Airport]]: dedicated to [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]], two anti-mafia judges killed by the mafia in early 1990s, is located {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Palermo (Punta Raisi).

The airport's rail facility, known as [[Punta Raisi railway station]], can be reached by trains departing from [[Palermo Centrale railway station|Palermo Centrale]], [[Palermo Notarbartolo railway station|Palermo Notarbartolo]] and Palermo Francia.

[[Palermo-Boccadifalco Airport]] is the second airport of the city.

===Port===
The [[port of Palermo]], founded by [[Phoenicia]] over 2700&nbsp;years ago, is the main gate to reach [[Sicily]] together with [[port of Messina]]. From here the [[Ferry|ferries]] link Palermo to [[Cagliari]], [[Genoa]], [[Livorno]], [[Naples]], [[Tunis]] and others for a total of almost 2&nbsp;millions passengers yearly. It's an important port for the cruise ships. Traffic include also almost 5 mllions tonnes of cargo and 80.000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] yearly.<ref>See {{it icon}} [http://www.assoporti.it/sites/www.assoporti.it/files/statistiche/Movimenti_portuali_%202011_26giu12.pdf table from assoporti.it+</ref> The port has also links to the minor sicilian islands like [[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]] (in summer via [[Cefal<U+00F9>]]).

===National rail===
The main station of Palermo is [[Palermo Centrale railway station|Palermo Centrale]] and links through the [[Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane|Ferrovie dello Stato]] net to the other city of Sicily [[Agrigento]] [[Trapani]] [[Catania]] and through [[Messina]] and his [[Strait of Messina|strait]] to the rest of [[Italy]]. The railways also connect to the [[Palermo International Airport|Palermo airport]] with departures every thirty minutes.

==Patron saints==
The patron saint of Palermo is [[Saint Rosalia|Santa Rosalia]], who is widely venerated.
On 14 July, people in Palermo celebrate the ''Festino'', the most important religious event of the year. The Festino is a procession in the main street of Palermo to remember the miracle attributed to Santa Rosalia who, it is believed by the vast majority of people, freed the city from the [[Black Death]] in 1624. The cave where the bones of Santa Rosalia were discovered is on Monte Pellegrino (see above): when her relics were carried around the city three times, the plague was lifted. There is a Santuario marking the spot and can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city below.

Before 1624 Palermo had four [[patron saint]]s, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], [[Saint Christina of Bolsena|Saint Christina]], [[Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha|Saint Ninfa]] and [[Saint Olivia]].

[[Saint Lucy]] is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called [[cucc<U+00EC>a]]. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine through the intercession of St Lucia. A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the population was so hungry that they did not waste time in making flour but ate the grain as it had arrived.

[[Saint Benedict the Moor]] is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.

The ancient patron of the city was the [[Genius of Palermo]], [[genius loci]] and [[numen]] protector of the place, that became the laic patron of the modern Palermo.<ref>([[Italian language|It]]) Alberto Samon<U+00E0>.
