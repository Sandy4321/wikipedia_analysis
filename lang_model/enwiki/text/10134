'''The Florida Boys Quartet''' is a [[southern gospel]] vocal quartet founded in about 1946 by J.G. Whitfield. Originally named the Gospel Melody Quartet, the group was re-named in 1954.

== History ==
Roy Howard, the group's original lead singer, had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[1951]] and died shortly thereafter. [[Doyle Wiggins]] sang lead for about a year. When he left in [[1953]], he was replaced by [[Les Beasley]]. Beasley remained at the lead position through [[1999]], when he stepped aside and hired [[Josh Garner]] to fill the position. Beasley continued to play [[bass guitar]] and act as the group's master of ceremonies.

[[Glen Allred]] joined as baritone in [[1952]]; [[Darrell Stewart]] became the group's [[pianist]] in 1956. Allred, Stewart, and Les Beasley remained at their respective positions for over four decades. During this time, various tenors and basses sang with the group. [[Billy Todd]] joined the group as bass singer in the late 1950s, and stayed with the group until [[1972]]. He was replaced by [[Buddy Liles]], who had sung with the [[Orrell Quartet]], the [[Rhythm Masters]], the [[Landmark Quartet]], and the [[Rebels Quartet]]. Liles stayed with the group for over two decades.

Their final two albums, "Sing Your Blues Away" (2005) and "Keep On Singing" (2006), were received well by Southern Gospel fans, labeled by many as their best recordings.

In 2007, the Florida Boys had two personnel changes at relatively the same time, as long-time bass singer Gene McDonald left to work for a bus company, and tenor Harold Reed left to join the Kingsmen Quartet. McDonald was replaced by Butch Owens, and lead singer Josh Garner moved up to the tenor position, with Les once again singing lead for the group.

Then, in June of 2007, [[Les Beasley]] announced that the legendary quartet would be disbanding the following month. However, he also announced that they would come back together once more for a farewell appearance at the [[National Quartet Convention]] in September 2007.

At the "farewell concert" it was announced that, with the blessing of Les, Glen, and Darrell, the Florida Boys name would be continuing. The <U+201C>new<U+201D> Florida Boys will be an announced tenor, Charlie Waller - Lead, Buddy Burton - Baritone, Chris Cooper - Bass, and Joshua Pope - Piano.
