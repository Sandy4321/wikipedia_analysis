==History==
Barnes & Noble originated in 1873 when Charles Barnes opened a book-printing business in [[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]], [[Illinois]]. Their first true bookstore was set up by his son, William, in partnership with G. Clifford Noble, in 1917 in [[New York, New York|New York City]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Cynthia |last=Blair |title=1917: First Barnes & Noble Bookstore Opens in Manhattan |url=http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-ihiny021705story,0,5026610.htmlstory |publisher=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> The original bookstore was at 31 West 15th St., and opened during [[World War I]]. In 1932, at the height of the [[Great Depression]], the bookstore was moved to its current flagship location on 18th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]].<ref name=HobokenPatch>Tavani, Andrew. [http://hoboken.patch.com/articles/end-of-an-era-for-barnes-noble-in-hoboken "End of an Era for Barnes & Noble in Hoboken"] ''Hoboken Patch''; January 29, 2010</ref>

The business was purchased in 1971 by [[Leonard Riggio]], who oversaw the growth of the business. In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore to advertise on television, and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers<U+2019> list price.<ref>{{Cite document | title = Barnes & Noble History | url = http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our_company/history/bn_history.html#H3 | accessdate = 2008-06-13 | publisher = [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which were eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles, and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.

Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and in 1987 purchased the primarily [[shopping mall]]-based [[B. Dalton]] chain from [[Dayton Hudson]]. The last B. Dalton stores are slated to close in January 2010. The acquisition of 797 bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and as of the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/for_investors/annual_reports/bnannual99.pdf BarnesAndNobleInc.com]</ref>  B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.<ref>{{cite web |first=Warren |last=St. John |title=Barnes & Noble's Epiphany |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.06/barnes.html |date=1999-07-06 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref>

Before Barnes & Noble created its web site, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs.  It first began selling books online in the late 1980s, but the company<U+2019>s website was not launched until May 1997.<ref name=HobokenPatch/> According to the site, it now carries over 1 million titles.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/help/cds2.asp?PID=8184 About Barnes & Noble.com]; Barnes&Noble.com; Accessed September 4, 2010</ref>

In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named [[CEO]].  Barnes & Noble has been spending millions on legal fees to defend against a lawsuit by billionaire investor [[Ron Burkle]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Carl |last=Gutierrez |title=Brawl With Burkle Weighs On Barnes & Noble |url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/24/barnes-noble-retail-markets-equities-burkle.html?boxes=marketschannelnews |date=2010-08-24 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>  Burkle is engaged in a [[proxy fight]] against chairman Steve Riggio in an attempt to change the management and direction of Barnes & Noble.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Weinman |title=Barnes & Noble's Founder Digs In for Proxy Fight With Ron Burkle |url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/company-news/barnes-and-nobles-founder-digs-in-for-proxy-fight-with-ron-burkle/19600678/ |date=2010-08-19 |publisher=[[DailyFinance]] |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref>  Burkle is concerned about falling profits and disagrees with Barnes & Noble's e-book strategy.<ref>{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Wahba |title=TIMELINE-Ron Burkle's proxy fight for Barnes & Noble |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0310522720100903 |date=2010-09-03 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref>

===Steve Riggio, CEO and Vice Chairman===<!--section linked from "Steve Riggio"-->
Steve Riggio is vice chairman of the company and served on the board of directors. Riggio began his career at Barnes & Noble in 1975 after graduating from [[Brooklyn College]]. After getting his start in the buying and merchandising departments, he became general manager and vice president of the company<U+2019>s [[Advertising mail|direct mail]] division. He held this position from 1981 to 1987. Riggio became executive vice president of merchandising in 1987. Then, in 1995, he was appointed chief operating officer. He was appointed CEO in January 2003 and held that position till March 2010.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our_company/management_team/steve_riggio/steve_riggio.html Barnes & Noble Booksellers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition to his career at Barnes & Noble, Riggio serves on the board of directors of the [[National Book Foundation]], [[Association for the Help of Retarded Children]] and the [[National Down Syndrome Society]].

==Publishing==<!-- This section is linked from [[Nine Men's Morris]] -->
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.

Barnes & Noble began to publish books during the 1980s, when they started reissuing out-of-print titles. One of these titles, ''[[The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense]]'' by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], has sold over 250,000 copies.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/out_company/history/bn_history.html BarnesAndNobleInc.com]</ref> The reissued edition of ''[[The Columbia History of the World]]'' by [[John Garrity]], for example has sold over 1 million copies.<ref name=BNSiteHistory>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our_company/history/bn_history.html Barnes & Noble History]; Barnes & Noble Inc.; Accessed September 4, 2010</ref>

Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company<U+2019>s acquisition of [[SparkNotes]], an educational website and publishing company. Further expansions of the company<U+2019>s publishing business include the purchase of how-to publisher [[Sterling Publishing]] in 2003.<ref name=BNSiteHistory/>

From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint [[Barnes & Noble Classics Collection]]. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dustjacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, trade paperback and mass-market editions.

==Caf<U+00E9>s==
The first store to feature a caf<U+00E9> serving [[Starbucks]] beverages was in [[Springfield, New Jersey]] in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a cafe serving [[Starbucks]] beverages, [[Harney & Sons]] or [[Tazo]] Tea, [[FIJI Water|FIJI]] Bottled Water, bakery goods from [[The Cheesecake Factory]], candy from [[Godiva Chocolatier]]s, sandwiches and other specialty products.  Although the caf<U+00E9>s are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation; the prominent Starbucks logo is sometimes confusing for customers wanting to use Starbucks [[stored-value card]]s or the Starbucks Gold Card, which are not accepted (the Barnes & Noble Membership is accepted to receive a discount on any Cafe related good).

In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering [[Wi-Fi]] in the caf<U+00E9> area of selected stores, using the [[AT&T]] FreedomLink network. All 777 stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. As of July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/free-wifi-barnes-nobel-starbucks-att.html LAtimes.com]</ref>

==Community involvement==
Barnes & Noble hires community relations managers to engage in community outreach. The responsibilities of these managers include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children<U+2019>s storytimes and book groups. Community relations managers work closely with local schools and groups for the promotion of literacy and the arts. One of the things that Barnes & Noble does in the community is sponsor a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our_company/community/community.html Community page] at Barnes & Noble Booksellers; Accessed September 5, 2010</ref> Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs which raise funds for schools and libraries. The company also hosts an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. 1.16 million books were collected and distributed in 2007.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/our_company/community/Holiday_Book_Drive/holiday_book_drive.html Holiday Book Drive]; Barnes & Noble Booksellers; Accessed September 5, 2010</ref> To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge where if children read 8 books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the readers a free book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/summerreading/|title=Summer Reading Challenge|work=Barnes & Noble website |accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref>
