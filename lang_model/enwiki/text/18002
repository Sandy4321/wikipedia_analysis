'''Vellore Woods Public School''' is an elementary school in [[Woodbridge, Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It was opened in 2002 in the community of Vellore Woods. The school is a continuation of two other schools, one a log cabin [[one-room schoolhouse]] built in the 1830s, and the second a more impressive structure which, although closed in 1957, was an operating school from the 1860s and is still standing today.  The community itself was named after the town of [[Vellore]] in [[India]], site of a British victory in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

The school has several sports teams including :
[[Volleyball]] Team (Both genders, separate teams and a junior mixed team)
[[Basketball]] Team (Both genders, separate teams)
Boys [[Soccer]] Team,
[[Cross country running|Cross-Country]] Team (Both genders together)
[[Track and Field]] Team (Both genders together)

The school mascot is a [[wolf]]. The school is often referred as "Vellore Wolves" or "The Wolves"

The school's current principal is Mr. David Moore, and the current vice-principal is Ms. Mona Bongard.
