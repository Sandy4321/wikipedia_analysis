The '''''Dresden Triptych''''' (or '''''Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor''''', or '''''Triptych of the Virgin and Child''''') is a very small hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Jan van Eyck]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Alte Meister]], Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non-portrait signed with his personal motto, ''<small>ALC IXH XAN</small>'' ("I Do as I Can").<ref group=a>The words "As I Can" are a play on his name. Their spelling varies between examples, usually translated as ''Als ich can''. See Dhanens (1980), 188, 385</ref> the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian portraiture]] that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Elisabeth Dhanens describes it as "the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived".<ref name ="Dhanens246">Dhanens (1980), 246</ref>

The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] in an [[Annunciation]] scene painted in [[grisaille]], which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]] on her lap. On the left hand wing [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] presents a kneeling [[Donor portrait|donor]], while on the right St. [[Catherine of Alexandria]] stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering.  The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]], while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.

The work may have been intended for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th&nbsp;century-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged [[coats of arms]] on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the [[Giustiniani]] of [[Genoa]]&nbsp;<U+2013> an influential ''[[Albergo (family)|albergo]]'' active from 1362&nbsp;<U+2013> who established trade links with [[Bruges]] as early as the mid-14th century.

==Provenance and attribution==
The ''Dresden Triptych'' was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century.<ref name ="Dhanens246"/> It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by [[Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to [[Charles I of England]] in 1627.<ref name="Streeton" /> After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by Eberhard Jabach, the [[Cologne]]-based banker and art dealer for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the [[Elector of Saxony]], and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the [[Gem<U+00E4>ldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden Collection]], attributed to [[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer]],<ref name ="Dhanens246"/> until the German historian [[Aloys Hirt]] in 1830 established it as a van Eyck.<ref name="Streeton" /> In the mid-19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to [[Hubert van Eyck]] (d.&nbsp;1426) and a few years later to Jan.<ref name ="Dhanens246"/>

[[File:jan van Eyck 076.jpg|thumb|172px|''Lucca Madonna (van Eyck)|Jan van Eyck's ''Lucca Madonna'', c.&nbsp;1436. [[St<U+00E4>delsches Kunstinstitut]], Frankfurt]]
Van Eyck signed, dated and added his motto to the central panel, a fact only discovered when the frame was removed in the course of a mid-20th century restoration,<ref name="P<U+00E4>cht83"/> and confirmed with the 1959 discovery of the signature which is placed along with the words ''<small>IOHANNIS DE EYCK ME FECIT ET C[OM]PLEVIT ANNO D[OMINI MCCCCXXXVII.ALC IXH XAN</small>'' ("Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437. As I Can"). The word "completed" (''complevit'') may suggest the completion date, but as master painters of the era  typically had workshops to assist on major works, the wording can be seen as aggressively socially ambitious; perhaps an arrogant master painter indicating his workshop assistants had little material involvement in the panels, and that he was primarily responsible for its design and execution. This view is reinforced by the fact that it is the only non-portrait to contain van Eyck's motto, ''<small>ALC IXH XAN</small>''.<ref name="b60" /> Until the discovery of the signature the piece was variously dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s.<ref name = "Dhanens242"/> Because the panels are so definitely attributed they are often used as a touchstone to date van Eyck's other works; there are a number of evident stylistic developments, including the type of stained glass windows and mouldings around the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], and his ability at handling [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which can be used to determine if other works at least pre-date the triptych.<ref name="h152">Harbison (1991), 152</ref>

The central panel has often been compared to his unsigned and undated ''[[Lucca Madonna (van Eyck)|Lucca Madonna]]'' of c.&nbsp;1436. That work echoes the central panel of the Dresden triptych in a number of aspects, including the dark green canopy, the figuration and positioning of Mary, her heavily-folded dress, the orange and brown pigments of the floor, the geometric carpet and the wooden carvings.<ref name="h106" /> The Lucca Madonna is thought to be a portrait of the artist's much younger wife, [[Portrait of Margaret van Eyck|Margaret]].<ref>Harbison (1991), 97</ref>

==Description==
The work measures {{convert|33|<U+00D7>|27.5|cm|in}} including the frames.<ref name="Streeton" /> Given this miniaturist scale, the triptych probably functioned as a portable devotional piece, or ''altare portabile''.<ref name="h61"/> Members of the upper-classes and nobility acquired these through papal dispensation,<ref name="Streeton" /> to use during travel and typically during pilgrimage. Van Eyck's patron and employer [[Philip the Good]] owned at least one portable triptych
of which fragments survive.<ref name ="Luber24">Luber (1998), 24</ref>

The three inner panels comprise a typical ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]]'', a form established in Italy in the latter half of the 14th century with a [[patron saint]] presenting the donor, usually kneeling, to an enthroned "Deity or Mother of God".<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht81">P<U+00E4>cht (1999), 81</ref> John Ward believes the rich and complex [[iconography]] and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed in his religious panels served to highlight the co-existence the artist saw between the spiritual and material worlds. In his earlier paintings, subtle iconographical features&nbsp;<U+2013> referred to as disguised symbolism&nbsp;<U+2013> are typically woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]".<ref name="W11">Ward (1994), 11</ref> These elements include the apparition of the Virgin before the donor, whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life.<ref name="W11"/> In his religious panels after 1436, van Eyck's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced. Ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice, or he "decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and&nbsp;.... much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers."<ref>Ward (1994), 13</ref> According to Jacobs, the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed. This is most evident in the disparity between the monochromatic exterior and vivid inner panels.<ref name="Jacobs 2012 80">Jacobs (2012), 80</ref>

===Frames===
[[File:Dresden triptych Catherine and frame 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of the right panel showing St.&nbsp;Catherine and the inner mouldings of the protective frame]]

The triptych retains its original frames, which are both ornate and served to protect the piece from the effects of light and smoke during travel and when ''in situ''.<ref name="n239">Nash (2008), 239</ref>  The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions,<ref name="Streeton" /> and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a carved set of [[coat of arms]].<ref name = "Dhanens242"/> The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose. They are decorative, similar to margins in medieval manuscripts, and set the context for the imagery; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.<ref name="s146">Smith (2004), 146</ref> Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs, Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres, with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence. The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly, with St. Catherine's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels.<ref>Jacobs (2012), 83</ref>

The inscriptions on the central panel are fragments from the [[Book of Wisdom]] (7:26 and 7:29), and [[Ecclesiastes]] (24: 23<U+2013>24).<ref name ="Dhanens385">Dhanens (1980), 385</ref><ref group=a>The lettering on that panel reads: <small>''HEC EST SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM DISPOSTITIONEM STELLARUM LUCI COMPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR. CANDOR EST ENIM LUCIS AETERNAE ET SPECULUM SINE MACULA DEI MAIESTATIS ECT. EGO QUASI VITIS FRUCTIVICAVI SUAVITATEM ODORIS ET FLORES MEI FRUCTIS HONORIS ET HONESTATIS. ECO MATER PULCHARAE DILECTIONIS ET TIMORIS ET MAGNITUDINES ET SANCTAE SPEI''</small> ("She is more beautiful than the sun and above the whole order of the stars. Being compared with the light of day, she is found to excel. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the flawless mirror of God's majesty. As a vine I have brought forth a pleasant fragrance, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and probity. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of greatness, and of holy hope"). see Dhanens (1980), 385; Heath (2008), 110</ref> Those on the wing panels are taken from texts referring directly to the two saints.<ref name="Streeton" />

===Inner panels===
====Virgin and Child====
In the central panel the Virgin and Child are enthroned in a church [[nave]] within a columned [[basilica]] running on either side.<ref name="h106">Heath (2008), 106</ref> The columns are painted using a variety of dark red, orange and grey pigments, a colour scheme which Peter Heath describes as lending to a "sense of airy silence".<ref name="h107">Heath (2008), 107</ref> The throne is positioned on a [[dais]], before a lavishly detailed [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]] lying on a similarly geometrically designed tiled floor.<ref name="h106" /> The arms of the canopied throne and the arches to either side contain carved or sculptured figures, including tiny representations of [[Isaac]], and [[David and Goliath]],<ref>Dhanens (1980), 248</ref> although art historian Antje Maria Neuner reads this carving as showing [[Jephthah]] sacrificing his daughter.<ref name="h107" /> Mary wears a richly embroidered and as is typical for van Eyck, voluminous red robe, which effectively serves as a [[Baldachin|cloth of honour]].<ref>Purtle, Carol J. Review of "The Marian Paintings of Jan van Eyck", by Goodgal, Dana. ''Renaissance Quarterly'', Volume 36, No. 4, Winter, 1983. 590<U+2013>594</ref> The robe is placed over a blue square-cut underdress edged with a jewelled border.<ref name= "Weale29"/> In van Eyck's Marian paintings, he almost always clothes her in red writes P<U+00E4>cht, which makes her seem to dominate the space.<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht84"/> The Christ Child is naked and holds towards the donor a [[banderole]]<ref name="h106" /> adorned with a phrase from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (11:29), ''<small>DISCITE A ME, QUIA MITIS SUM ET HUMILIS CORDE</small>'' ("Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart").<ref name="b60" />

[[File:Jan van Eyck - Triptych of Mary and Child, St. Michael, and the Catherine - Google Art Project.jpg Crop.jpg|thumb|310px|Detail showing the Virgin and Child sitting on the canopied throne with multi-coloured marble columns to the left]]
Mary's presence in the church is symbolic; she and the child occupy the area where the altar would normally be situated.<ref name="b56">Borchert (2008), 56</ref> Like van Eyck's two other late Madonna portraits (''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'' of 1436 and ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' of c.&nbsp;1438<U+2013>40), Mary is unrealistically large and out of proportion to her surroundings. This reflects the influence of 12th- and 13th-century Italian artists such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]], who in turn drew on the tradition of monumental depictions of Mary from [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] icons. According to [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], Mary is presented as if about to "rise from her throne and advance into the same plane as St. Michael and St. Catherine, she would tower above them and also above the columns of the church."<ref name="C23" /> This idea is in keeping with van Eyck's tendency in such portraits to present Mary as if she was an apparition materialising before the donor in response to his prayer and devotion.<ref>Nash (2008), 283</ref> Van Eyck's Mary is here monumental, but less overwhelmingly large than in 13th century works. She is disproportionate to the architecture in her panel, but approximately proportional to the figures in the wings. This restraint evidences the beginning of van Eyck's mature phase, most evidently seen in the composition's "greater spatial depth".<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht82">P<U+00E4>cht (1999), 82</ref>

Christ's pose closely follows that of the ''Paele Madonna''; his body still leans towards the donor but here his head faces the viewer more directly.<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht84">P<U+00E4>cht (1999), 84</ref>

====Saints and donor wings====
[[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] and the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] occupy the right and left hand panels respectively. They appear to stand in either the aisles<ref name="C23">Campbell (2004), 23</ref> or [[Ambulatory|ambulatories]],<ref name="Streeton" /> and a few bays to the fore compared to the central panel.<ref name="h106" /> Their depictions are in keeping with the artist's evolving style: the aisles convey spaciousness, especially by the implied spaces out of view, while both saints subtly lean close to Mary. The use of perspective makes the saints appear small; according to P<U+00E4>cht they are "less solid than the massive figures in the ''Paele Madonna''. It was this Gothic daintiness that led many scholars&nbsp;... to place this among Jan van Eyck's early work".<ref name ="P<U+00E4>cht83">P<U+00E4>cht (1999), 83</ref> The two side panels are filled with light streaming through the windows that reflects off the saints' accoutrements, glinting from St. Michael's armour and St. Catherine's bejewelled steel sword.<ref name="h107"/>

[[File:Jan van Eyck Dresden Catherine.jpg|thumb|140px|Detail showing a crowned [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]]. She can be identified through the various [[hagiography|hagiographical]] objects around her.]]
On the right panel St. Catherine is presented as almost the essence of a gothic princess. She stands reading a book in "ravishing modesty",<ref name ="Dhanens246"/> with unbound blonde hair, which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', combined with her rich blue gown and [[tabard]] of white draped [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] showing her as the princess she was. A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck. The attributes associated with her are by her side: the sword with which she was beheaded her in her right hand, and the wheel used for her torture can be seen lying her feet.<ref name = "D250">Dhanens (1980), 250</ref> Like the woman in van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' she is "fashionably pear-shaped"; according to Heath her attire is "more dazzling than the Virgin's", mirroring St. Michael's splendid armour on the opposite panel.<ref name="h112">Heath (2008), 112</ref>

St. Catherine's presence can be attributed to a number of factors. At that period her reputation and popularity were second to Mary's; she was both an educated and outspoken woman during her lifetime&nbsp;<U+2013> characteristics that perhaps mirrored the donor's. She is absorbed in her book in a contemplative manner, which might be reflective of a donor with a similar temperament.<ref name="h110" /> The frame of her wing is inscribed with the words <small>''VIRGO PRUDENS ANELAVIT, GRANUM SIBI RESERVAVIT, VENTILANDO PALEAM. DISIPLINUS EST IMBUTA PUELLA COELESTIBUS, NUDA NUDUM EST SECUTA CHRISTUM PASSIBUS, DUM MUNDANIS EST EXUTA ECT''</small> ("The prudent virgin has longed for the starry throne where she has made her place ready; leaving the world's threshing floor, she saved the grain for herself by winnowing the chaff. The young girl has been steeped in heavenly learning. Stripped of everything, with sure footsteps she followed Christ until she was delivered from earthly affairs").<ref name="h112"/><ref name="Dhanens 1980 368"/>

[[File:Dresden Triptych Detail Archangel Michael with Donor 1.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|Detail of the Archangel Michael presenting the donor. Note the two faux bronze painted frames.]]
A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly-detailed buildings<ref name="b60">Borchert (2008), 60</ref> and hills before snowcapped mountains.<ref name="h112"/>

A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael.</small><ref name="Dhanens 1980 368">Dhanens (1980), 368</ref> Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet,<ref name= "Weale29">Weale (1903), 29</ref> while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards [[Orans|as if in prayer]], although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger,<ref name="h107" /> and is dressed in a long olive-green green [[houppelande]],<ref name="Streeton" /> at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian court]].<ref name="h61"/> The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur.  The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the ''Arnolfini Portrait''.<ref name = "D248ff"/>

The [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier ''van der Paele'' and ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'',<ref name = "D248ff"/> and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer.<ref>Teasdale-Smith (1981), 274</ref> Dhanens speculates that they might depict the [[sarcophagus]] of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] in [[Pisa]], which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander.<ref name = "D248ff">Dhanens (1980), 248<U+2013>249</ref> Ward compares the carving to a similar one found in the Washington ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''.<ref name = "Ward209"/> Unlike in van Eyck's earlier votive portraits the donor is positioned at a remove from the Marian apparition, and at a much smaller scale to Mary on a triptych wing.<ref name="h61">Harbison (1991), 61</ref>

The lettering running along the edges of the panel's frame consists of a prayer fragment from the liturgy for the [[Michaelmas|feast of St. Michael]]. The extract reads ''<small>HIC EST ARCHANGELUS PRINCEPS MILITAE ANGELORUM CUIUS HONOR PRAESTAT BENEFICIA POPULORUM ET ORATARIO PERDUCIT AD REGNA COELORUM. HIC ANGELUS MICHAEL DEI NUNTIUS DE ANIMABUS JUSTIS. GRATIA DEI ILLE VICTOR IN COELIS RESEDIT. A PACIBUS</small>'' ("This is Michael the Archangel, leader of the angelic hosts, whose privilege it is to grant favours to the people, and whose prayer leads them to the Kingdom of Heaven. The Archangel Michael is God's messenger for the souls of the just. By the grace of God, that great victor has taken his place in Heaven, on the side of peace'").<ref name="h110">Heath (2008), 110</ref>

===Outer panels===
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Small Triptych (outer panels) - WGA07615.jpg|190px|left|thumb|The closed view shows an ''Annunciation'', with imitation statues of the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] and Mary.]]
When the triptych is closed, the outer wings reveal an [[Annunciation]] scene with the [[Archangel Gabriel]] and Mary painted in [[grisaille]]. The figures form an [[Illusionism (art)|illusionistic]] imitation of sculpture, a conceit which van Eyck extends by  placing them on octagonal pedestals.<ref name="b60" /> The figures are illuminated by light from the left, a device van Eyck often used to imply the presence of God. A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]], hovers above Mary. Because the dove is also in grisaille but not attached to a pedestal and apparently floating unfixed above the saints, its presence serves to highlight that the viewer is not looking at sculpture but at a painted representation of sculpture.<ref>Jacobs (2012), 63</ref>

The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th-century [[polyptych]]s. The tradition originates from Byzantine art, with van Eyck largely responsible for re-popularising the practice.<ref name="j64">Jacobs (2012) 64</ref> Along with his ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the ''Dresden Triptych'' is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique, and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid-15th century.<ref>Jacobs (2012), 63<U+2013>64</ref> As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ, its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels.<ref name="h55">Harbison (1995), 55</ref>

[[File:Hugo van der goes portinari triptych closed.jpg|thumb|240px|Outer wings of [[Hugo van der Goes]]'s ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', c. 1475. [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], Florence. Van der Goes closely follows the convention established by van Eyck, although he omits the octagonal pedestals typical of actual sculpture.<ref name="h55"/>]]
The outer wings of 15th-century [[diptych]]s and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille. Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then-46&nbsp;day [[lent]]en period leading up to Easter. There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays, when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels.<ref name="h54-5">Harbison (1995), 54<U+2013>55</ref>

According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the outer panels are a "brilliant success&nbsp;... in imparting a sense of life to the supposed statues."<ref name = "D251"/> The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille outer panels wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the ''Ghent Altarpiece''.<ref name = "Ward209">Ward (1975), 209</ref>

==Architecture==
The depicted church is of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] elements. There are pointed [[Canopy (building)|canopies]] above Mary, and the nave is narrow, barely wide enough to contain her. It is walled by a [[colonnade]] joined by [[entablature]]s and capped with rounded arches.<ref name="h151" /> The columns are variously of pink, red and purple marble. Each of the capitals is decorated with faux carvings, some showing representations of the twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] under a small [[baldachin]]. The [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] is visible in the aisles but not in the central nave.<ref name = "D248ff"/> There are a number of implied spaces not visible to the viewer. The central panel contains two on either side of the pillars, others lead from the balcony above the throne, and there are unseen exits to hallways at the rear of the two wing panels.<ref name="h151">Harbison (1991), 151</ref> The east facing windows in the right hand wing resemble those in van Eyck's ''[[Rolin Madonna]]''.<ref name = "D248ff"/>

The centre panel's spatial depth marks an advancement in van Eyck's technique, especially when compared to his similar 1436 ''{{plain link|http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_van_Eyck_054-096.jpg|Diptych of the Annunciation}}'' or ''van der Paele'' panel, both of which are comparatively flat. The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin at the far end of the pictorial space, making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown.<ref name="P<U+00E4>cht83" /> The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne.<ref name="h106"/> This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the ''Lucca Madonna'' and van der Paele panels.<ref name = "D248ff"/>

As with van Eyck's earlier paintings of interiors, the building is not based on a particular place, but is an imagined and idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect and representational architectural space. This is evidenced by a number of features that would be unlikely in an actual contemporary church such as the sculptures that were more secular in nature. In detailing the structure he pays close attention to contemporary models, which he possibly combined with elements from ancient buildings. The columns contain "high [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] bases" found in early churches and on the [[Arch of Constantine]].<ref>Wood, Christopher. ''Forgery, Replica, Fiction: Temporalities of German Renaissance Art''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. 195<U+2013>96. ISBN 0-226-90597-7</ref> [[Craig Harbison]] believes that because the interior is not based on an actual building, the viewer is not burdened by preconceptions, a device which perhaps opens up the painting's "physiological" impact. In his view, the panels capture the moment when the donor's prayer and piety is rewarded by an apparition of the Virgin and Child. The novelty and unworldliness of the situation is highlighted by the unrealistic size of the Virgin compared to her surroundings.<ref name="h151" />

Light plays a central role in all panels, to an extent almost comparable to van Eyck's ''Madonna in the Church''. The arches and columns are bathed in daylight, echoed by the text of the inscriptions around the central frame allude to light and illumination.<ref name = "D251">Dhanens (1980), 252</ref> Van Eyck pays close attention to the saturating effects and gradations of the light, which enters from the left and spreads across the middle ranges of each panel. He often used light to indicate a divine ethereal presence.<ref>Smith (2003), 63</ref> Because the implied spaces found on either side of Mary and leading into each of the wing panels are bathed in this light, they can be seen as conduits for the divine.<ref name="h151" />

The triptych influenced [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s 1445<U+2013>50 ''[[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece]]'' in a number of aspects, most obviously in its disregard of scale, especially with Mary's size relative to the other figures and surrounding architecture. Van der Weyden develops the idea further, placing a large crucifixion towering above the figures and almost spanning the height of the central panel.<ref name="C23" />

The identity of the [[Donor portrait|donor]] has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy.<ref name="h61"/> Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchant.<ref name="Streeton"/> This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to [[Giovanni Mazone]]'s ''Virgin and Child'' altarpiece in [[Pontremoli]], [[Tuscany]], which may place it in the Italian region of [[Liguria]] at latest by the end of the 15th century.<ref name="h61" /> Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames<ref name="Streeton">Streeton, No<U+00EB>lle L.W.

Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost.<ref name = "Dhanens242"/> Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family,<ref group=a>The Rapondis had strong banking ties to the Burgundian dukes and were active in Paris and the Low Countries. See Small, Graham. "The City, the Duke and Their Banker: The Rapondi Family and the Formation of the Burgundian State (1384<U+2013>1430)". ''The Economic History Review''. Volume 60, No. 3 (Aug., 2007), 626<U+2013>627</ref> whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from [[Lucca]], who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in [[Wervik]] paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a [[stipend]] funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the donor's identity is lost, but she says of the piece that "it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels."<ref name = "Dhanens245">Dhanens (1980), 245</ref>

==Condition==
The triptych is in poor condition, having suffered damage and heavy paint loss, and has undergone a number of restorations.<ref name="c139">Campbell (2006), 139</ref>  The outer wooden frames, originally painted in grey and yellow marbling, were later overpainted in a design of black and red<ref name="Jacobs 2012 80" /> in the 16th or 17th centuries when "a faux turtle-shell design, imitating the then-fashionable veneer, replaced the earlier scheme of jaspered paint".<ref name="Streeton" /> An ebony surround was added to the inner frames for protection in the 1840s.<ref name="Streeton" /> There has been extensive repair work on the paint forming Mary's dress,<ref name="b60" /> with large areas of her gown repaired in 1844 by painter [[Eduard Bendemann]].<ref name="c139" /><!-- was there only one restoration in the 1840s w/ conflicting dates in sources? --> The badly damaged coats of arms have been retouched,<ref name = "Dhanens242">Dhanens (1980), 242</ref> while the frames have sustained impairment and are overpainted in areas.<ref name="h61"/> The painting was looted and taken to Moscow during the Second World War. It was returned in 1959 when it was cleaned, restored and underwent examination in a laboratory. This process revealed the ''<small>ALC IXH XAN</small>'' inscription on the inner moulding of the central frame in front of the tiled floor when a coat of brown paint was stripped away.<ref name="Streeton" /><ref name = "Dhanens242"/> The surround was removed during the 1959 restoration.<ref name="Streeton"/>
