This is a list of '''open-source software packages''': [[computer software]] licensed under an [[open-source license]]. Software that fits the [[Free software definition]] may be more appropriately called [[free software]]; the [[GNU]] project in particular objects to their works being referred to as <U+00BB>open source<U+00AB>. For more information about the philosophical background for open source software, see [[free software movement]] and [[Open Source Initiative]]. However, nearly all software meeting the [[Open Source Definition]] also meets [[The Free Software Definition]].  Software that meets either is listed here.
