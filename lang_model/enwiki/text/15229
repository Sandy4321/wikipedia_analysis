"'''No Hay Igual'''" is a song recorded by Canadian singer [[Nelly Furtado]] for her third studio album ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' (2006). It was written and produced by Furtado, [[Timbaland|Tim "Timbaland" Mosley]], [[Danja (record producer)|Nate "Danja" Hills]] and [[Nisan Stewart]], with vocal production by [[Jim Beanz]]. While working with Timbaland and Danja at [[The Hit Factory]] in Miami, Florida, [[Pharrell Williams]] introduced her to [[reggaeton]], a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to "No Hay Igual" "nearly on the spot". It is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[reggaeton]] song in which Furtado sings in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and raps in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] over a reggaeton rhythm.

"No Hay Igual" was released as the [[lead single]] of ''Loose'' on 11 April 2006 by [[Geffen Records]]. It received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]] with some of them calling the song a highlight on ''Loose'' and praising its production. A [[music video]] for the remix of "No Hay Igual" with [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]] was shot in [[La Perla, San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The video features Furtado and P<U+00E9>rez characters in various situations throughout the slum astride such as eating ice cream and playing [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]. Furtado performed a medley of "No Hay Igual" with "Party" (''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', 2002) on the [[Get Loose Tour]] in 2007. The live performance was included on Furtado's first live album ''[[Loose: The Concert]]'' (2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nelly-furtado-performs-her-hits-live-on-loose-the-concert-dvd-and-cd-releasing-dec-4-on-geffen-records-59879742.html|title=Nelly Furtado Performs Her Hits Live on 'Loose The Concert' DVD and CD Releasing Dec. 4 on Geffen Records|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

In August 2005, when it came time for Furtado to "lay down the tracks" for her third studio album ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'', she turned to [[hip hop music|hip hop]] producer [[Timbaland]], who she previously collaborated with on the remix to [[Missy Elliott]]'s "[[Get Ur Freak On]]" (2001).<ref name="Nelly Furtado Brings the Punk-Hop">{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nelly-furtado-brings-the-punk-hop-20060216|title=Nelly Furtado Brings the Punk-Hop|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Lash|first=Jolie|date=16 February 2006|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> [[Interscope Records]] president [[Jimmy Iovine]] played Furtado a few of Timbaland's latest productions, which she responded positively to.

Rene Perez, of Calle 13, said he hoped that the video would help them both reach new audiences: "It's a good opportunity for us both. More than the North American market, the European market really interests me and her because her family is Portuguese."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060629081749/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/06/26/1654778-ap.html|title=Furtado films video in Puerto Rico|publisher=[[Jam!]].

The video starts with Furtado walking under a stone bridge near which is an icon of [[Jesus Christ]]. As the video progresses she continues to walk and starts singing the song's lyrics. She then arrives at one building where P<U+00E9>rez is at the balcony putting his shirt on while Furtado interpreters the lyrics referring to him. He then starts joining her as other residents start starring at them. Scenes are intercut with both of them at a pastry shop, seductively eating ice cream. Then, P<U+00E9>rez is shown at an underground graffiti place rapping his verse on the song. Scenes are intercut with both of them at a club playing [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]. The video intercuts with scenes of Furtado and P<U+00E9>rez dancing while performing the song, crowded with other people around them. The video ends with both of them walking towards the bridge in an early morning.
