[[Major]] '''Kenneth George Mayhew''', [[Military William Order|RMWO]] ([[Honingham]], 18 January 1917) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] veteran from the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Mayhew is one of the few living knights of the [[Military William Order]], the highest [[Dutch honours system|honour]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

Conscripted in 1939 Mayhew served as an officer of the 1st Battalion of the [[Suffolk Regiment]]. He commanded a company which [[Normandy landings|landed in Normandy]] in 1944 and fought in the [[North West Europe Campaign]]. Mayhew was injured while fighting in the [[Netherlands]]. He resumed command of his company before being injured again and returning to the United Kingdom.

In 1946 Mayhew was [[Knighthood|knighted]] by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], receiving the fourth class (Knight) of the Military William Order. The chapter of the order lost contact with him in the 1980s until he was seen wearing his medal at a memorial service in 2011. He subsequently became an active member of the order.

== Early life ==
Mayhew was born in [[Honingham]] on 18 January 1917, as the son of a farmer.<ref name=defensie>{{cite web|url=http://www.boekje-pienter.nl/images/nieuws-03112011.pdf |title=En toen waren er weer acht... |publisher= [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Defensiekrant]] |language=Dutch |date=3 November 2011}}</ref> He attended [[Framlingham College]] before studying at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in Oxford, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938 and a Master of Arts degree in 1952. From 1936 to 1939 he played cricket for the [[Suffolk County Cricket Club]].<ref name=oldframlinghamian>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldframlinghamian.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=11817 |title=Major Kenneth Georhe Mayhew RMWO (R29-34) |publisher= [[Framlingham College|The Society of Old Framlinghamians]] |accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>

== Military service ==
[[File:Kenneth Mayhew.jpg|thumb|left|Second Lieutenant Mayhew, 1940<U+2013>41]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 Mayhew was [[Conscription|conscripted]]. In January 1940, he entered the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and following completion of his training became a second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the [[Suffolk Regiment]], [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Brigade]], [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]]. Originally scheduled to cross to Southern France in 1940 before the [[Fall of France]], the battalion stayed in the United Kingdom, and from 1942 they began preparing for an invasion of France and simulating landings.<ref name=defensie /><ref name=oldframlinghamian /><ref name=limburger>{{cite web|url=http://www.boekje-pienter.nl/images/nieuws-03112011.pdf |title=Vergeten oorlogsheld |publisher= [[Dagblad de Limburger]] |language=Dutch |date=4 November 2011}}</ref>

On 6 June 1944 Mayhew commanded a company equipped with 13 [[Universal Carrier|armoured infantry carriers]] that landed at [[Sword Beach]] in [[Normandy]], on D-Day.<ref name=defensie /><ref name=oldframlinghamian /> His unit captured the Hillman Battery, a 12-bunker complex defended by 150 men of the [[716th Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|736 Infantry Regiment]], as part of the liberation of [[Colleville-Montgomery|Colleville-sur-Orne]].<ref name=defensie /> They then fought during the [[Battle for Caen]], and on 28 June were part of [[Operation Charnwood]], fighting a battle at ''Ch<U+00E2>teau de la Londe'', which left 161 dead on the British side.<ref name=oldframlinghamian /><ref name=limburger /> His company liberated [[Flers, Somme|Flers]] and moved on towards [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=defensie />

The 1st Battalion were supposed to meet airlifted troops at [[Arnhem]] as part of [[Operation Market Garden]], which failed however. During battles in the Netherlands Mayhew's company took part in the liberation of [[Weert]] (22 September), [[Venray]] and [[Overloon]] (16<U+2013>19 October).<ref name=defensie /><ref name=limburger /> In Weert, Captain Mayhew was assisted by local resistance fighters. In order to locate German positions they often had to expose themselves to enemy fire, which resulted in several injuries among the company. On 16 October 1944, during the [[Battle of Overloon]], Mayhew was injured by shells while creating bridges for tanks across a stream at Venray. He was sent to a hospital in [[Brussels]], but returned to his company, against the orders of his doctors, in fear that his command might be given away to someone else. On 25 February 1945 he was again injured while advancing towards the [[Rhine]], and was evacuated back to the United Kingdom.<ref name=limburger />

== Knighthood ==
After the Second World War the government of the Netherlands wished to reward foreign soldiers for their services in liberating the country. They requested that foreign governments send recommendations for honours. In October 1945, the United Kingdom recommended Mayhew for the Order of the [[Bronze Lion]] or [[Bronze Cross (Netherlands)|Medal of the Bronze Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7400292 |title=Recommendation for Award for Mayhew, Kenneth George |publisher= [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> The Dutch government however decided that a higher honour should be awarded. On 24 April 1946, by [[Royal Decree]], Mayhew was [[Knighthood|knighted]] by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], receiving the fourth class (Knight) of the Military William Order.<ref name=GazetteRMWO>{{London Gazette|issue=38018|startpage=3320|endpage=|supp=y|date=18 July 1947|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> The Order is the highest and oldest military [[Dutch honours system|honour]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], bestowed for "performing excellent acts of Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty in battle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lintjes.nl/onderscheidingen/de-militaire-willems-orde |title=Military William Order - Official website |publisher= Chapter of the Military William Order |language=Dutch |accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> The award is comparable to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Victoria Cross]] and seldom awarded.

Instead he received the honour by mail.<ref name=defensie /> As of December 2014, Mayhew is one of only five knights still living.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3944564/gijs-tuinman-ridder-militaire-willems-orde-geslagen.html |title=Gijs Tuinman tot Ridder der Militaire Willems-Orde geslagen |publisher= [[NU.nl]] |language=Dutch |date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

== Later life ==
[[File:Zes ridders MWO.JPG|thumb|left|Mayhew (second from the right) with fellow knights of the Military William Order in 2012]]
After the war Mayhew became a representative in artificial fertilizers.<ref name=defensie /> In 1965, in honour of the 150 year anniversary of the Military William Order, Mayhew was received by Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] at [[Huis ten Bosch]]. In the 1980s contact with the chapter of the order was lost when Mayhew moved. The last contact with the order was in 1982, when he received a book about the Military William Order by mail. Mayhew was eventually presumed dead and went unnoticed when he attended the revealing of a monument in honour of the Suffolk Regiment in [[Weert]] in 1994.<ref name=limburger />

While attending a memorial service at Venray in September 2011, Mayhew was seen wearing decorations of the Military William Order. Only seven knights were known to be alive at the time and held in the highest regard, with the knighting of [[Marco Kroon]] in 2009, the first new knight in over half a century, receiving broad national media attention. As such, the discovery of an eighth knight was widely published. The chapter of the order confirmed his membership and informed the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Minister of Defence]] and Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]], the grandmaster of the order. The Dutch embassy in London sent a representative to Mayhew's home to reestablish contact. In May 2012 Mayhew visited the Netherlands where he was received by Queen Beatrix. He met with the other Dutch knights, and was presented with an appreciation medal from the municipality of Venray.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omroepvenray.nl/nieuws/2012/05/11/waarderingspenning-voor-oorlogsheld |title=Waarderingspenning voor oorlogsheld |publisher=Omroep Venray |language=Dutch |date=11 May 2012}}</ref><ref>Door de Wapenbroeders herontdekte Ridder Militaire Willems-Orde door Venray gehuldigd (in Dutch).

Since 2012 Mayhew has visited the Netherlands several times and has been active as a member of the Military William Order. In May 2013 he was an honorary guest at the annual [[Liberation Day (Netherlands)|Liberation Day]] ceremony in [[Wageningen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/21539236/__Capitulatie_herdacht__.html |title=Capitulatie herdacht in Wageningen |publisher=[[De Telegraaf]] |language=Dutch |date=6 May 2013}}</ref> and visited the [[Overloon War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?video/81334512/Drager+van+Militaire+Willemsorde+bezoekt+Oorlogsmuseum+Overloon.aspx |title=Drager van Militaire Willemsorde bezoekt Oorlogsmuseum Overloon |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]]. video on [[YouTube]] |language=Dutch |date=6 May 2013}}</ref> In May 2014 Mayhew opened the annual Liberation Day celebrations in Wageningen, attended by over 1800 veterans and 120.000 visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoogenlaag.nl/lokaal/1800_veteranen_bij_bevrijdingsdefil_3010709.html#.VJfpI14Ac |title=1800 veteranen bij bevrijdingsdefil<U+00E9> |publisher=Hooglaag.nl |language=Dutch |date=6 May 2014}}</ref> Later that month Mayhew baptised tulips in London, a gift from the Netherlands to mark the 70 year anniversary of Operation Market Garden, attended by representatives from the Dutch, British, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Polish and US armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/what-s-on/arts-culture/travel-tulips-for-dutch-liberators-1-6068317 |title=Travel: Tulips for Dutch Liberators |publisher=[[Hemel Hempstead Gazette]] |date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tgcmc.newsweaver.co.uk/gtnxtra/q28isdlwdw6 |title=Tory Chief Whip plants bulbs of Liberty at Kew |publisher=[[GTN News]] |accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> On 6 December 2014 he was an  honorary guest at the knighting of [[Gijs Tuinman]], one of only two knights present, out of only four alive at the time. The event, which was broadcast live on Dutch national television, saw Mayhew welcoming Tuinman as a new member of the order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/23410548/__Nieuwe_ridder_ging_door_vuur__.html |title=Nieuwe ridder ging door vuur voor z'n mannen |publisher=[[De Telegraaf]] |language=Dutch |date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

As a D-Day veteran and member of Suffolk Regiment, Mayhew attended several memorial services in Normandy in 1994, 2004 and 2014. These services were organised by a local association called "Les Amis du Suffolk R<U+00E9>giment" ([[French language|French]]: ''Friends of the Suffolk Regiment'') and the municipality of [[Colleville-Montgomery]], which was liberated by the Suffolk Regiment in 1944. In 2014, Mayhew met with a former German defender of Hillman Battery and also with a grandson of Colonel Ludwig Krug, the commander of Hillman Battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/70e-d-day-la-foule-au-site-hillman-pour-commemorer-la-liberation-2604063 |title=70e D-Day.
