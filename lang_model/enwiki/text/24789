'''''Adenanthos cuneatus''''' is a shrub of the [[Proteaceae]] family, native to the [[South Coast Western Australia|south coast]] of [[Western Australia]]. It was originally described by French naturalist [[Jacques Labillardi<U+00E8>re]] in 1805. Common names include '''Coastal Jugflower''', '''Flame Bush''', '''Bridle Bush''' and '''Sweat Bush'''. Growing to 2&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft) high and wide, it is erect to prostrate in habit, with wedge-shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair. The single red flowers are insignificant, and appear all year, though more so in late spring. The reddish new growth occurs over the summer.

The shrub grows on sandy soils in heathland. Pollinators include [[honeyeater]]s, particularly the [[Western Spinebill]], [[silvereye]], [[honey possum]] and bees. It is sensitive to [[dieback]], and hence requires a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in garden situations. A dwarf and prostate form are in cultivation.

==Description==
''Adenanthos cuneatus'' grows as an erect, spreading or prostrate shrub to 2&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft) high and wide. It has a woody base, known as a [[lignotuber]], from which it can resprout after bushfire. The wedge-shaped ([[cuneate leaf|cuneate]]) leaves are on short petioles, and are 2&nbsp;cm (0.8&nbsp;in) long, and 1<U+2013>1.5&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.6&nbsp;in) wide, with 3 to 5 (occasionally up to 7) rounded 'teeth' or lobes at the ends.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991: 61-62">Wrigley (1991): 61<U+2013>62.</ref><ref name="Nelson 1995: 331">Nelson (1995): 331.</ref> New growth is red and slightly [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]]. It glows bright red against the light, especially when the sun is low in the sky.<ref name="George 1984">{{cite book | author = George, Alex | year = 1984 | title = An introduction to the Proteaceae of Western Australia | publisher = Kangaroo Press | location = Kenthurst | isbn = 0-86417-005-X | page = 4}}</ref> New growth is mainly seen in summer, and the leaves in general are covered with fine, silvery hair. Occurring throughout the year but more often from August to November, the insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around 4&nbsp;cm (1.6&nbsp;in) long.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991: 61-62"/><ref name="Nelson 1995: 331"/> The pollen is triangular in shape and measures 31<U+2013>44 [[micrometre|<U+03BC>m]] in length, averaging around 34 <U+03BC>m.<ref name=hopper80>{{cite journal|title= Bird and Mammal Pollen Vectors in ''Banksia'' Communities at Cheyne Beach, Western Australia|author=Hopper, Stephen D.|journal= Australian Journal of Botany |volume=28|issue=1|pages=61<U+2013>75|year=1980}}</ref>

The species is similar in many ways to its close relative ''[[Adenanthos stictus|A.&nbsp;stictus]]''. The most obvious difference is in habit: ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' is a multi-stemmed, lignotuberous shrub that rarely grows over 2 m in height, where ''A.&nbsp;stictus'' is single-stemmed and non-lignotuberous, and commonly reaches 5 m in height. Leaves are similar, but the lobes at the leaf apex are regular and [[crenate]] (rounded) in ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'', but irregular and [[dentate]] (toothed) in ''A.&nbsp;stictus''.<ref name="Nelson 1978: 389">Nelson (1978): 389.</ref> Also, new growth does not have a red flush in ''A.&nbsp;stictus'', and juvenile leaves of ''A.&nbsp;stictus'' are usually much larger that adult leaves, a difference not seen in ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus''. The flowers of the two species are very similar, differing only subtly in dimension, colour and [[indumentum]].<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 139-144">Nelson (1975b): 139<U+2013>144.</ref>

==Taxonomy==
===Discovery and naming===
The first known botanical specimen of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' was collected in December 1792, by French botanist [[Jacques Labillardi<U+00E8>re]]. Labillardi<U+00E8>re was botanist to an expedition under [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]], which anchored in [[Esperance Bay]] on the south coast of Western Australia, on 9 December. Though the precise time and location of the collection is unknown, it is likely that it was made on 16 December, while searching the area between [[Observatory Point]] and [[Pink Lake (Western Australia)|Pink Lake]] for the [[zoologist]] [[Claude Riche]], who had gone ashore two days earlier, and failed to return. Following an unsuccessful search the following day, several senior members of the expedition were convinced that Riche must have perished of thirst or at the hands of the [[Australian Aborigine]]s, and counselled d'Entrecasteaux to sail without him. However Labillardi<U+00E8>re convinced d'Entrecasteaux to search for another day, and was rewarded not only with the recovery of Riche, but also with the collection of several highly significant botanical specimens, including the first specimens of ''[[Anigozanthos]]'' (Kangaroo Paw) and ''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' (West Australian Christmas Tree). ''Adenanthos cuneatus'' was probably also collected at this time.<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 24">Nelson (1975b) '''1''':24</ref><ref name="Duyker 2003">{{cite book|first = Edward|last = Duyker|year = 2003|title = Citizen Labillardi<U+00E8>re: A naturalist's life in revolution and exploration|location = Carlton|publisher = Miegunyah Press|isbn = 0-522-85160-6|pages = 133<U+2013>134}}</ref>

It would be thirteen years before Labillardi<U+00E8>re would publish a formal description of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'', and in the meantime there were several further collections: Scottish botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] collected a specimen on 30 December 1801, during the visit of [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] to [[King George Sound]];<ref name="FloraBase Brown 1 3258 2">{{cite web | title = ''Adenanthos cuneatus'' Labill. | work = Robert Brown<U+2019>s Australian Botanical Specimens, 1801<U+2013>1805 at the BM | publisher = [[FloraBase]], [[Western Australian Herbarium]] | url = http://florabase.calm.wa.gov.au/brown/search?brname=Adenanthos+cuneatus | accessdate = 2011-01-05}}</ref> and, fourteen months later, further King George Sound specimens were collected by [[Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour]], botanist to [[Nicolas Baudin]]'s voyage of exploration,<ref name="Nelson 1975a: 332">Nelson (1975a): 332.</ref> and "gardener's boy" [[Antoine Guichenot]].<ref name="Nelson 1976">{{cite journal | author = Nelson, E.

("On the seashore, grows, in great abundance, ''Adenanthos cuneata'', the softer-leaved ''Adenanthos sericea'', and a species of the same genus with rounded leaves.")}}

Labillardi<U+00E8>re eventually published the genus ''Adenanthos'', along with ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' and two other species, in his 1805 ''[[Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen]]''. He chose the specific name ''cuneata'', in reference to the leaves of this species, which are [[cuneate leaf|cuneate]] (triangular).<ref name="Nelson 1978: 389"/><ref name="Nelson 1975b: A126">Nelson (1975b) '''2''': A126.</ref> ''Cuneata'' has [[feminine gender]], consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardi<U+00E8>re to the genus.<ref name="Nelson 1978: 320">Nelson (1978): 320.</ref> He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the [[type species]] of ''Adenanthos'', but Irish botanist [[Ernest Charles Nelson|E. Charles Nelson]] has since chosen ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' as [[lectotype]] for the genus, since the [[holotype]] of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardi<U+00E8>re's description of it is the most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.<ref name="Nelson 1978: 318, 320">Nelson (1978): 318, 320.</ref>

===Synonymy===
In 1809, [[Richard Salisbury]], writing under [[Joseph Knight (horticulturist)|Joseph Knight]]'s name in the controversial ''[[On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae]]'', published the name ''Adenanthes'' {{sic}} ''flabellifolia'', listing ''A.&nbsp;cuneata'' as a synonym.<ref name="Knight 1809">{{cite book | author = Knight, Joseph; [Salisbury, Richard] | year = 1809 | title = [[On the Cultivation of the Plants Belonging to the Natural Order of Proteeae]] | page = 96}}</ref> As no [[type specimen]] was given, and no specimen annotated by Knight could be found, this was treated as a [[nomenclatural synonym]] of ''A.&nbsp;cuneata'', therefore rejected on the [[Priority (nomenclature)|principle of priority]].<ref name="Nelson 1978: 387">Nelson (1978): 387.</ref><ref name="APNI 21376">{{APNI | name = ''Adenanthos flabellifolius'' Knight [ nom. illeg. ] | id = 21376}}</ref>

Also synonymised with this species is ''Adenanthos crenata'', published by [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]]'s in [[Curt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel]]'s 1825 16th edition of ''[[Systema Vegetabilium]]''. Willdenow published both ''A.&nbsp;cuneata'' and ''A.&nbsp;crenata'', giving them different descriptions, but designating the same type specimen for both.<ref name="Willdenow 1825">{{cite book | author = Willdenow, Carl Ludwig | editor = Sprengel, Curt Polycarp Joachim | title = Systema vegetabilium | edition = 16th | page = 472}}</ref> Thus ''A.&nbsp;crenata'' was rejected under the principle of priority,<ref name="Nelson 1978: 387"/> and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus''.<ref name="APNI 21274">{{APNI | name = ''Adenanthos crenatus'' Willd.'' | id = 21274}}</ref>

===Infrageneric placement===
In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published the first infrageneric arrangement of ''Adenanthos'' in Volume 5 of his landmark ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. Bentham divided the genus into two [[taxonomic section|section]]s, placing ''A.&nbsp;cuneata'' in [[Adenanthos sect. Stenolaema|''A.''&nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaema'']] because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle.<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia | author = Bentham, George | year = 1870 | title = Adenanthos | encyclopedia = [[Flora Australiensis]] | volume = 5 | pages = 350<U+2013>356 | location = London | publisher = L. Reeve & Co.}}</ref> This arrangement still stands today, though ''A.''&nbsp;sect. ''Stenolaema'' is now renamed to the [[autonym (botany)|autonym]] [[Adenanthos sect. Adenanthos|''A.''&nbsp;sect. ''Adenanthos'']].

A [[phenetic]] analysis of the genus undertaken by  Nelson in 1975, yielded results in which ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' was grouped with ''A.&nbsp;stictus''. This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included ''[[Adenanthos forrestii|A.&nbsp;forrestii]]'', ''[[Adenanthos eyrei|A.&nbsp;eyrei]]'', ''[[Adenanthos cacomorphus|A.&nbsp;cacomorphus]]'', ''[[Adenanthos ileticos|A.&nbsp;ileticos]]'', and several hybrid and unusual forms of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus''.<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 123, 124">Nelson (1975b) '''1''': 123, 124.</ref> Bentham's sections were supported by Nelson's analysis, and so they were retained when Nelson published [[Nelson's taxonomic arrangement of Adenanthos|a taxonomic revision of the genus]] in 1978. He further subdivided ''A.''&nbsp;sect. ''Adenanthos'' into two subsections, with ''A.&nbsp;cuneata'' placed into [[Adenanthos subsect. Adenanthos|''A.''&nbsp;subsect. ''Adenanthos'']] for reasons including the length of its perianth,<ref name="Nelson 1978">Nelson (1978)</ref> but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of ''Adenanthos'', for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' series of monographs. By this time, the [[ICBN]] had issued a ruling that all genera ending in ''-anthos'' must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became ''cuneatus''.<ref name="Nelson 1995: 331"/>

===Hybrids===
''Adenanthos cuneatus'' apparently forms hybrids with other ''Adenanthos'' species quite readily, as four putative natural hybrids have been reported:
* [[Adenanthos <U+00D7> cunninghamii|''A.''&nbsp;<U+00D7> ''cunninghamii'']] (Albany Woollybush), a hybrid between ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' and ''[[Adenanthos sericeus|A.&nbsp;sericeus]]'', was first collected in 1827, and published as ''A.&nbsp;cunninghamii'' in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings are known to have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid,<ref name="Nelson 1995: 331"/> and this was confirmed by [[genetic analysis]] in 2002.<ref name=Advice>{{cite web | title=Adenanthos cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush) | work=Advice to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (the Committee) on Amendments to the list of Threatened Species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) | url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/adenanthos-x-cunninghamii.pdf  | accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> In appearance it is very similar to ''A.&nbsp;sericeus'', but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.<ref name="Cochrane 2004">{{cite journal | authpr = Cochrane, Anne; Barrett, S.; Byrne, M. | year = 2004 | title = A rare hybrid beauty <U+2014> Albany Woollybush | journal = Landscope | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 7-8 | publisher = Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), Government of Western Australia | location = Perth | url = http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,1966/ | accessdate = 2011-01-06}}</ref>
* A single plant discovered by Nelson near [[Israelite Bay]], where both putative parents co-occur, is regarded as a hybrid between ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' and ''[[Adenanthos dobsonii|A.&nbsp;dobsonii]]''. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'', but whereas ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of ''A.&nbsp;dobsonii'' (though ''A.&nbsp;cuneatis'' itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick [[indumentum]] of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'', being bright green the the sparse indumentum of ''A.&nbsp;dobsonii''. Flower colour is like that of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' but the [[style (botany)|style]] lacks an indumentum, like ''A.&nbsp;dobsonii''.<ref name="Nelson 1978: 391">Nelson (1978): 391.</ref>
* Two plants found near [[Twilight Cove]] are regarded as hybrids between ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' and ''[[Adenanthos forrestii|A.&nbsp;forrestii]]'', the only two ''Adenanthos'' species to occur in the area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by [[Alex George]] in 1974. They are about 5 km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'', but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed.<ref name="Nelson 1978: 392">Nelson (1978): 392.</ref>
* In his 1995 revision, Nelson refers to putative hybrids with ''A.&nbsp;dobsonii'' and ''[[Adenanthos apiculatus|A.&nbsp;apiculatus]]'', citing the 1978 paper in which he published putative hybrids with ''A.&nbsp;dobsonii'' and ''A.&nbsp;forrestii''.<ref name="Nelson 1995: 331"/> It is unclear whether the reference to ''A.&nbsp;apiculatus'' is an error or a fourth putative hybrid.

===Common names===
Several common names have been recorded for this species, some of which are highly localised. Two names allude its consumption by horses; ''Bridle Bush'', a name used east of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] refers to the fact that horses favour it as [[fodder]]; and ''Sweat Bush'', used around [[Hopetoun, Western Australia|Hopetoun]], derived from the claim that horses break out in [[sweat]] after consuming young growth. The common name of  ''Flame Bush'' is derived from the brilliant red new growth, and it is also known as ''Coastal Jugflower''.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991: 61-62"/><ref name="George 1984"/><ref name="Nelson 1978: 389"/> Nelson also records the use of the names ''Templetonia'' and ''Native Temp'', but ridicules them as obvious errors.<ref name="Nelson 2005">{{cite journal |  author = Nelson, Ernest Charles|authorlink=Ernest Charles Nelson | year = 2005 | title = The koala plant and related monickers | journal = Australian Systematic Botany Society Newsletter | issue = 125 | pages = 2<U+2013>3 | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/asbs/newsletter/pdf/05-dec-125.pdf | accessdate = 2011-01-06}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==

The most widely distributed ''Adenanthos'' species of the south coast,<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 299">Nelson (1975b): 299.</ref> ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' is common and locally abundant between [[King George Sound]] and [[Israelite Bay]], along the coast and up to 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) inland. There are also isolated populations extending west to [[Walpole, Western Australia|Walpole]], and in the [[Stirling Range]]. East of Israelite Bay there are a few isolated populations which occur as far east as [[Twilight Cove]].<ref name="Nelson 1978: 388">Nelson (1978): 388.</ref>

This species is restricted to [[siliceous]] sandplain soils, and will not grow in [[calcareous]] soils such as the [[limestone]] plains of the [[Nullarbor]], or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth.<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 262, 268">Nelson (1975b): 262, 268.</ref> This explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay: the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of [[cliff-top dune]]s of siliceous sand provide suitable habitat.<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 311">Nelson (1975b): 311.</ref> Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry, ''A.&nbsp;cuneatus'' tolerates a range of [[edaphic]] conditions: it grows in both [[laterite|lateritic]] sand and sands of [[marine]] origin,<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 252">Nelson (1975b): 252.</ref> and it tolerates [[pH]] levels ranging from 3.8 to 6.6.<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 254">Nelson (1975b): 254.</ref>

Consistent with these edaphic preferences, ''A. cuneatus'' is a frequent and characteristic member of the [[kwongan]] heathlands commonly found on the sandplains of [[Southwest Australia]].<ref name="Nelson 1978: 388"/> The climate in its range is [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]], with annual rainfall from 275&nbsp;mm to 1000&nbsp;mm (10<U+2013>40&nbsp;in).<ref name="Nelson 1975b: 261">Nelson (1975b): 261.</ref>

''Adenanthos cuneatus'' was taken to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in cultivation in Australia,<ref name = "Wrigley 1991: 61-62"/> and the western United States.<ref name="Nelson 2006">{{cite journal | author = Nelson, Ernest Charles | year = 2006 | title = ''Adenanthos'' Labill. - A Plantsman's Retrospect and Prospect | journal = Australian Plants | volume = 23|issue=186 | pages = 199<U+2013>214}}</ref> Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well,<ref name = "Wrigley 1991: 61-62"/> but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. Western Australian nurseryman [[George Lullfitz]] recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a [[Garden_design#Rock_garden|rockery]].<ref name="Lullfitz 1978">{{cite book | author = Lullfitz, George | title = Grow the West's Best Native Plants | location = Perth | publisher = Periodicals Division, West Australian Newspapers | page = 39}}</ref>

*''A.'' "Coral Drift" is a compact form in cultivation since at least the 1990s. It is 50<U+2013>70&nbsp;cm (20<U+2013>28&nbsp;in) tall and 1<U+2013>1.5 m (3<U+2013>5&nbsp;ft) wide. The grey foliage has pinkish purple new growth.<ref name="Nelson 2006"/>

*''A.'' "Coral Carpet" is a prostrate form which peaks at around 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) high and spreads to 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) across. The new foliage is a pinkish purple. A chance seedling from <U+2018>Coral Drift<U+2019>, it was originally developed by George Lullfitz of Lullfitz Nursery in [[Wanneroo, Western Australia|Wanneroo]]. It became available to the public in 2005, and has been registered successfully under Plant Breeders<U+2019> Rights.<ref name="Nelson 2006"/> <!-- on March 13, 2006.
