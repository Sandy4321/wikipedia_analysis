'''''Hulk''''' (also known as '''''The Hulk''''') is a 2003 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk (comics)|character of the same name]]. [[Ang Lee]] directed the film, which stars [[Eric Bana]] as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well as [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Josh Lucas]], and [[Nick Nolte]]. The film explores the origins of the Hulk, which is partially attributed to Banner's father's experiments on himself, and on his son. 

Development for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be directed by [[Joe Johnston]] and then [[Jonathan Hensleigh]]. More scripts had been written by Hensleigh, [[John Turman]], [[Michael France]], [[Zak Penn]], [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]], [[Michael Tolkin]], and [[David Hayter]] before Ang Lee and [[James Schamus]]' involvement. ''Hulk'' was shot mostly in [[California]], primarily in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. 

The film grossed over $245 million worldwide, higher than its $137 million budget, but still considered somewhat of a disappointment.  The film received mixed to very positive reviews from film critics. Many praised the writing, acting, character development of the film, and the music score by [[Danny Elfman]], but criticized the character origins differing from the comics and the dark, depressing story plot. Producer Avi Arad called the film a "windfall" for Marvel at the box office, and that ''Hulk'''s merchandising was successful enough to make a sequel. This eventually led to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ing with ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), which is also viewed as a [[Stand-alone_sequel#Stand-alone_sequels|stand-alone sequel]] as much of the plot of ''The Incredible Hulk'' is continuous of ''Hulk''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Ken P | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/491/491232p1.html | title = An Interview with Avi Arad | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2004-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-06-10}}</ref> 

==Plot==
{{plot|date=January 2013}}

David Banner is a [[genetics]] researcher who has figured out how to mutate human DNA so that the [[immune system]] can be even stronger causing the body to heal quickly from an injury or wound. He wants to use his research to create supersoldiers for the U.S. Army, but is denied permission to do it, so he experiments on himself. Once his wife gives birth to their son Bruce, David realizes his mutant DNA has been passed on and attempts to find a cure for his son's condition. In 1973, the government, represented by a then-[[Thunderbolt Ross|Lieutenant Colonel "Thunderbolt" Ross]], shuts down his research after learning of his dangerous experiments. David, in a fit of rage, causes a massive explosion of the facilities' gamma reactor, and in order to put an end to his fear of Bruce becoming a monster, arrives home to try to kill him, but however accidentally murders his wife. Banner, shocked and petrified by her death, is then put into a mental hospital, while 4-year-old Bruce is sent into foster care and adopted, suppressing the memories of his biological parents, believing them both to be deceased. The events surrounding his mother's death and his father's violent attack leaves Bruce unable to recall the details of his early childhood. He remembers his childhood in dreams, but never retains these memories after waking.
 	 
Years later, Bruce is a [[nuclear medicine|bionuclear]] researcher freshly-graduated at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The [[military-industrial complex]], represented by [[Major Glenn Talbot|Major Talbot]], becomes interested in the research of "[[nanomedicine|nanomeds]]",  to build a serum for regenerating soldiers. David reappears as a mysterious outcast in the city and begins infiltrating Bruce's life, working as a janitor in the lab building. Ross, now an Army general and the estranged father of Bruce's ex-girlfriend and co-researcher [[Betty Ross]], also begins to investigate. He becomes concerned both for his daughter's safety around Bruce and the fact that Bruce is working in the same field as David. After understanding that he is David's son, he strictly prohibits him to be anywhere near Betty. 

Bruce succumbs to an accident during a scientific experiment which exposes him to [[gamma radiation]] and the nanomeds, causing them to intertwine with Bruce's already-altered DNA. That night, his father confronts him, revealing their relationship and hinting at the mutation inside Bruce. Using samples of Bruce's DNA stolen from stray hair, he begins experimentation on animals. Soon after, the growing rage within Bruce stemming from all of the frustrations and stresses building up around him activates his irradiated DNA, transforming him into a huge, green, and muscular mutated moster (turning to [[The Incredible Hulk|Hulk]] for the first time).

After he destroys the lab he returns home, where he is found unconscious by Betty the following morning. When questioned by Betty he barely remembers his transformation. Ross arrives, suspicious, and places him under house arrest as well as taking over the lab. That night, David phones Bruce and tells him he has unleashed three mutant dogs to track down and kill Betty, whom he is angry at for being scolded by her about Bruce and only leaves her to be a test of determining further the Hulk. He is already enraged when he is attacked aggressively by Talbot for trying to escape the house, triggering another transformation. After seriously injuring Talbot and the guards, the Hulk heads off to Betty's cabin out in the woods and fights the three massive, deformed dogs. After Hulk rips them apart, saving Betty, he goes towards the lake to cool down. The next morning, Bruce is tranquilized and taken to a desert underground base. Betty pleads with her father to let her try to help Bruce control his transformations, but Ross remains extremely skeptical, believing Bruce will follow in his father's footsteps. In the meantime, David breaks into the lab and subjects himself to the nanomeds, gaining the ability to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he can touch ("''partake with the [[essence]] of all things''") and killing a police officer who interferes. 

Talbot, seeing an opportunity to profit from the Hulk's strength and regenerative capability, tries to anger him and obtain a sample of him in his superhuman form. Talbot puts him in a [[sensory deprivation]] tank and induces a nightmare that begins to trigger his repressed memories and transforms him into the Hulk, which leads eventually to Talbot's death. David appears to Betty at her house and offers to turn himself in, with one condition. In exchange, he wants to speak to Bruce one last time, as father and son and he tells her the whole, cloudy past story behind him, his wife, and Bruce, in which Betty finally understands what triggers his emotional problems. By now, The Hulk has escaped the base and fled into the desert. He battles army forces sent after him, defeating four [[M1A1 Abrams|Abrams tanks]], and four [[RAH-66 Comanche|Comanche helicopters]]. The Hulk soon learns to make prodigious leaps (like his comic-book counterpart), an ability that verges on the power of flight. In this manner, he makes his way to [[San Francisco]] rampaging the streets to find Betty, where he is confronted by two [[F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptors]]. Betty contacts her father and convinces him to let her meet the Hulk. He refuses to do so, but Betty explains that continuing to attack the Hulk will make him angrier and stronger. Seeing her while entirely surrounded by the army troops, his love for Betty overpowers his rage-induced Hulk state, and he transforms back into human form. 

After Ross once again has Bruce imprisoned, David is allowed to visit the base and talk to Bruce, albeit under heavily-armed guard. He has descended into full-blown megalomania by this point, and tells Bruce that he wants his real son, the Hulk; he tries to convince him assertively to surrender his power, but Bruce, who displays his anger towards his father for ruining his life that made him a monster, refuses. A power-lusting David bites off an electrical wire at the base, where he begins to radioactively ingest all its energy and mutate into a large, power-absorbing monster. Bruce then transforms into the Hulk and the two fly to a shore near a lake, where the battle starts. David is beaten by the Hulk repeatedly while trying to absorb his power, but while in the water of the lake, David demonstrates he gets more powerful if the Hulk keeps fighting him. He freezes Hulk in the water and taunts him to release his power. This reaches to a conclusion when Bruce allows his father to absorb his power, which proves too much for the unstable David to control, swelling his body into a huge [[amorphous]] form over the water. Ross orders a Gamma Charge Bomb fired on them from the F-22 Raptors, and both are presumed dead when no trace of them is found after the explosion. Bruce, who somehow survives the explosion in which David clearly dies, is unconsciously in his human form, remembering when his father said to him as a child while tucking him in bed, "Sweet dreams", which probably hints that his father might've still loved him. 

One year later, Bruce finds exile in the [[Amazon rainforest]] as a doctor in a medical camp. When soldiers try to steal some medical supplies from the camp, he confronts the ringleader. He says ''"Don't make me angry! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry!"'', a well-known quote from [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|the CBS television series]]. Bruce's eyes turn green, and above the rainforest [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], the loud roar of the Hulk can be heard as the screen fades to green.

==Cast==
*[[Eric Bana]] as [[Hulk (comics)|Dr. Bruce Banner]]: Bana was cast in October 2001, signing for an additional two sequels.<ref name=Rider/> Ang Lee felt obliged to cast Bana upon seeing ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'', and first approached the actor in July 2001.<ref name=Chopper>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2269 | title = Countdown to ''Hulk'': Ang Lee's new green destiny | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2003-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-06-17}}</ref> The role was heavily pursued by other actors. Bana was also in heavy contention for ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'', but lost out to [[Nicolas Cage]].<ref name=Rider/> Bana explained, "I was obsessed with [[The Incredible Hulk (television series)|the TV show]]. I was never a huge comic book reader when I was a kid, but was completely obsessed with the television show."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-12/27/12.00.film | title = Bana was TV ''Hulk'' Fan | publisher = [[Sci Fi Wire]] | date = 2001-12-27 | accessdate = 2010-04-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080401080622/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-12/27/12.00.film |archivedate = 2008-04-01}}</ref> It was widely reported [[Billy Crudup]] turned down the role. [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Steve Buscemi]] were reported to be in under consideration for the lead.<ref name=Hughes/> [[Edward Norton]], who went on to play the part in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', expressed interest in the role. Norton eventually turned down the part as he was disappointed with the script.<ref>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = Zak Penn on Norton as ''Hulk''! | publisher = [[Superhero Hype!]] | date = 2007-04-16 | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5506 | accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref><ref name=mull>{{cite news | title = Edward Norton talks Incredible Hulk | work= [[Total Film]] | date = 2008-03-07 | url = http://www.totalfilm.com/features/edward-norton-talks-incredible-hulk| accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

*[[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Betty Ross]]: Bruce's ex-girlfriend/co-researcher, as well as estranged daughter of General Ross. Betty is possibly the only way for the Hulk to lead back into his transformation of Bruce. Connelly was attracted to the role by way of director Ang Lee. "He's not talking about a guy running around in green tights and a glossy fun-filled movie for kids. He's talking along the lines of tragedy and psychodrama. I find it interesting, the green monster of rage and greed, jealousy and fear in all of us."<ref>{{cite news | title = Connelly Embraces ''The Hulk'' | publisher = [[Sci Fi Wire]] | date = 2001-12-10 | url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-12/10/13.00.film | accessdate=2010-04-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080214063756/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-12/10/13.00.film |archivedate = 2008-02-14}}</ref>

*[[Sam Elliott]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]]: A four star general and estranged father of Betty and the tertiary antagonist. Ross was responsible of prohibiting David Banner from his lab work after learning of his dangerous experiments. Elliot felt his performance was similar to his portrayal of [[Basil L. Plumley]] in ''[[We Were Soldiers]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | title = Elliott Talks ''Hulk'' | publisher = Comics2Film | date = 2002-02-28 | url = http://www.mania.com/elliott-talks-bihulkib_article_87814.html| accessdate = 2010-04-27}}</ref> Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being simply too excited to work with Ang Lee.

*[[Josh Lucas]] as [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]]: A ruthless former soldier who offers Banner and Betty Ross an opportunity to work for him in an attempt to start an experiment on self-healing soldiers. He is the secondary antagonist of the film. 

*[[Nick Nolte]] as [[Brian Banner|Dr. David Banner]]: The mentally unstable biological father of Bruce Banner who was also a genetics research scientist and had been locked away for several years for causing an explosion in the gamma reactor and accidentally killing his wife Edith. He is the main antagonist of the film. Paul Kersey portrays the young David Banner in flashbacks. Eventually he gains absorbing powers in the film, reminiscent of the comic book character [[Absorbing Man]], one of the characters that first appeared in the early scripts of the film. He also at one point becomes a towering creature composed of electricity, reminiscent of [[Zzzax]], one of the Hulk's enemies in the comic series.<ref name="Hater">{{cite news | author = KJB | title = David Hater Talks ''Hulk'' | publisher = [[IGN]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036564p1.html | accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

*[[Cara Buono]] as Edith Banner: Bruce's biological mother of whom he cannot remember. She is heard, but mostly appears in Bruce's nightmares.

*[[Celia Weston]] as Mrs. Krenzler: Bruce's [[adoption|adoptive]] mother who cared for him after the death of Edith and David's incarceration.

Hulk co-creator/[[executive producer]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[Lou Ferrigno]] [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as [[security guard]]s. [[Johnny Kastl]] and [[Daniel Dae Kim]] have small roles as soldiers.

==Development==
===Jonathan Hensleigh===
Producers [[Avi Arad]] and [[Gale Anne Hurd]] started the development for ''Hulk'' in 1990.<ref name=Hurd>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | url =http://www.mania.com/bcomiccon-ihulk-hulk-hulkib_article_88790.html | title = Comic-Con: ''Hulk'', ''Hulk'', ''Hulk''! | publisher = Comics2Film | date = 2002-08-06 | accessdate = 2010-04-27}}</ref> Hurd explained the Hulk became her favorite superhero as a child because "When girls are growing up, they're the ones who are picked on.

So, to me, the Hulk was wish fulfillment."<ref>{{cite news|author=Larry Carroll|title='Incredible Hulk' Producer Wants To Make A Sequel, Which Could Include Edward Norton|work=[[MTV]]|date=2008-10-24|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1597802/story.jhtml|accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> By December 1992 [[Marvel Studios]] was in discussions with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR101955 | title = Marvel Characters holding attraction for filmmakers | work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1992-12-12 | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> [[Michael France]] and [[Stan Lee]] were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept was to have the Hulk battle [[terrorists]], an idea France disliked. [[John Turman]], a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts, being heavily influenced by the ''[[Tales to Astonish#The Hulk and the Sub-Mariner|Tales to Astonish]]'' issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military,<ref name=dream/> the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and the atomic explosion origin from the comics,<ref name=make/> and [[Brian Banner]] as the explanation for Bruce's inner anger.

By late 1996 Hurd's husband [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] signed on as producer. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] was hired to use [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Hulk. For the second time, France was invited to write the script.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Comic Book Movies | publisher = [[Virgin Books]] | year = 2003 | location = [[London]] | pages = 261<U+2013>269 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6}}</ref> By April 1997 [[Joe Johnston]] was directing with the film's title as ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434784 | title = A Mania For Marvel | work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-04-14 | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> Universal wanted Hensleigh to write the script since he worked with Johnston on the financially successful ''[[Jumanji (film)|Jumanji]]''.

[[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were also brought on board to rewrite with Hensleigh still attached as director.<ref name=Hughes/> In October 1997, ''Hulk'' had entered [[pre-production]] with the creation of [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[computer animation]] already under way.

===Michael France===
Hensleigh found the rewriting process to be too difficult and dropped out, and felt he "wasted nine months in [[pre-production]]".<ref>{{cite news | author = Ken P | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/496/496784p2.html | title = An Interview With Jonathan Hensleigh | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2004-03-05 | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}</ref> It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure if this was a [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[adventure film|adventure]], or a [[comedy film|comedy]], and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a [[Jim Carrey]] or [[Adam Sandler]] movie."<ref name=Hughes/> France was writing the script on fast track from July&mdash;September 1999.

France stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his "amiable, [[nerd]]y genius" incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced [[Brian Banner]], Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father.<ref name=Hughes/> However, he has [[anger management]] issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The "Don't make me angry..." line from the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|TV series]] was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the [[Black Operation|black op]]s made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.<ref name=Hughes/>

===Ang Lee===
[[Michael Tolkin]] and [[David Hayter]] rewrote the script afterwards, despite positive response from the producers over France's script.

Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, "James Schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present.

==Production==
===Filming===
Filming began on March 18, 2002 in [[Arizona]], and moved on April 19 to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. This included [[Advanced Light Source]], [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley labs]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island military base]], and the sequoia forests of [[Porterville, California|Porterville]], before several weeks in the [[Utah]] and [[California]]n deserts. Filming then moved to the Universal backlot in [[Los Angeles]], using Stage 12 for the water tank scene, before finishing in the first week of August. Filming of ''Hulk'' constituted hiring 3,000 local workers, generating over $10 million into the local economy.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | title = Berkeley Workers Make Way For ''The Hulk'' | date = 2002-04-16 | url = http://www.mania.com/berkeley-workers-make-way-for-bithe-hulkib_article_88063.html | publisher = Comics2Film | accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = David E.Williams | title = Temper, Temper, | date = July 2003 | url = http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july03/cover/page2.html# | work= [[American Cinematographer]] | accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref><ref name=Marv>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | title = Marvel CC: ''Hulk'' TV, ''Daredevil'' Trailer 2, ''Punisher'', More! | date = 2002-08-09 | url = http://www.mania.com/marvel-cc-hulk-tv-daredevil-trailer-2-punisher-more_article_88811.html | publisher = Comics2Film | accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref><ref name=Leung>{{cite news | author = Kevin Leung | url = http://www.mania.com/bihulkib-smashes-san-fran_article_88162.html | title = ''Hulk'' Smashes San Fran! | publisher = Comics2Film | date = 2002-04-26 | accessdate = 2010-04-27}}</ref> [[Mychael Danna]], who previously collaborated with Lee on ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' and ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]'', was set to compose the [[film score]] before dropping out.

Eric Bana commented that the shoot was, "Ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways." Lee told him that he was shooting a Greek tragedy: he would be making a "whole other movie" about the Hulk at [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. An example of Lee's [[art film|art house]] approach to the film was taking Bana to watch a [[bare-knuckle boxing]] match.<ref name="beast"/> [[Visual effects supervisor]] [[Dennis Muren]] was on the set every day.<ref name=Hurd/> One of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for Bana was a [[split screen (film)|split screen]] technique employed by Lee to cinematically mimic the panels of a comic book page.
