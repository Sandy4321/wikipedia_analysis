Fox co-starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Leo and Me]]'' at the age of fifteen, and in 1979, moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to pursue an acting career at the age of eighteen.<ref name="actors"/> He was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the [[Television film|television movie]] ''Letters from Frank'', credited under the name "Michael Fox".  He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the [[Screen Actors Guild]], which does not allow duplicate registration names to avoid credit ambiguities, he discovered that [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], a veteran [[character actor]], was already registered under the name.<ref name="actors"/> As he explained in his autobiography, ''Lucky Man: A Memoir'', and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of "Andrew" or "Andy" Fox, so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on "J", in reference to actor [[Michael J. Pollard]].<ref name=MikeBio />

Fox<U+2019>s first feature film role was in [[Midnight Madness (film)|''Midnight Madness'']] (1980) credited as Michael Fox.  After this he played "Young Republican" [[Alex P. Keaton]] in the show ''[[Family Ties]]'' which aired on [[NBC]] for seven seasons, from 1982 to 1989.  Fox only received the role after [[Matthew Broderick]] was unavailable.<ref name=slate/>  ''Family Ties'' had been sold to the television network using the pitch "[[Hip (slang)|hip]] parents, [[Square (slang)|square]] kids,"<ref name=slate>[http://www.slate.com/id/2160944/pagenum/all/#page_start Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero]</ref> with the parents originally intended to be the main characters.  However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode.<ref name=slate/> At its peak, the audience for ''Family Ties'' drew one-third of America's households every week.<ref name="actors" /> Fox won three [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards for ''Family Ties'' in 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively.<ref name="Emmy" />  He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1989.<ref name=globes />  

[[Brandon Tartikoff]], one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box". After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your [[eating crow|crow in]]. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox". Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.<ref name="LuckyMan">{{Cite book

===''Back to the Future'' trilogy===
''[[Back to the Future]]'' tells the story of [[Marty McFly]] (Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent [[Time travel|back in time]] from 1985 to 1955. He meets his parents in high school, accidentally attracting his mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents to fall in love, while finding a way to return to 1985.
[[Eric Stoltz]] was already filming ''Back to the Future'' when [[Robert Zemeckis]], the director, felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.<ref name="Making">"Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)"</ref>  Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox.  During filming, Fox would rehearse for ''Family Ties'' from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m, then rush to the ''Back to the Future'' set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30 a.m.<ref name="actors" /> This schedule lasted for two full months.<ref name="actors" /> ''Back to the Future'' was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985, and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=backtothefuture.htm |title=Back to the Future Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' applauded the performances, arguing Fox and Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin]].<ref>{{cite web | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788826 | date = 1985-07-01 | title = Back to the Future | accessdate = 2008-10-09}}</ref> Two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' were released in 1989 and 1990, respectively.  

===Mid-career===
[[Image:Michael J. Fox with Rick Best.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Fox in September 1987]]
During and immediately after the [[Back to the Future (film series)|''Back to the Future Trilogy'']], Fox starred in ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' (1985), '' [[Light of Day]]'' (1987), [[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|''The Secret of My Success'']] (1987), ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1988) and ''[[Casualties of War]]'', (1989). 

In ''The Secret of My Success'', Fox played a graduate student from [[Kansas State University]] who moves to [[New York City]] where he has landed a job as a financier. The film was successful at the box office, taking $110 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo Website |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] in ''The Chicago Sun Times'' wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |publisher=''The Chicago Sun Times'' |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> 

In ''Bright Lights, Big City'' Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs.  The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in ''The Washington post'' criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".<ref name= "hinson">{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | coauthors = | title = ''City'' Blight | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>  Meanwhile Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".<ref name= "ebert">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Bright Lights, Big City'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = 2008-06-10 }}</ref> During the shooting of ''Bright Lights, Big City'', Michael was reunited with his on-screen girlfriend [[Tracy Pollan]] from ''Family Ties''. 

Fox then starred in ''[[Casualties of War]]'', a war drama about the [[Vietnam War]], alongside [[Sean Penn]].  ''Casualties of War'' was not a box office hit, but Fox, playing a Private serving in Vietnam, received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic<U+2019>s website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his Family Ties sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 1991, he starred in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon.  While relocating from Washington D.C. to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town. Michael Caton-Jones, from ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'', described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |publisher=Time Out Magazine |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer [[James Woods]]. Between 1992 and 1996, he continued making several films, such as ''[[For Love or Money (film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1993), ''[[Life With Mikey]]'' (1993) and ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' (1994).  Fox then played small supporting roles in political drama ''[[The American President (film)|The American President]]'' (1995) and comedy ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996).<ref name="actors"/> 

His last major film role was in ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996). ''The Frighteners'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating money out of customers for his "ghosthunting" business. However, a [[mass murder]]er comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, Kenneth Turan in ''The Los Angeles Times'' wrote; "The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and Alvarado, who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |title=The Frighteners Review |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=July 19, 1996 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

Fox has also done [[Voice acting|voice-over work]] providing the voice of Stuart Little in the [[Stuart Little (film)|''Stuart Little'']] movie and its [[Stuart Little 2|sequel]], both of which were based on the popular book by [[E.

===Illness and advocacy===
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological disorder. At present, there is no cure, but medications provide some relief from the symptoms. Fox manages his symptoms using the drug [[Sinemet]],<ref name="NPR Fresh Air">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1142526 "Fresh Air" interview by Terry Gross"] National Public Radio, April 2002.</ref> and he has also now had a [[thalamotomy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/06/parkinsons.deep.brain.stimulation/index.html |title=Brain implant better than meds for Parkinson's disease |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>

In his memoir, ''Lucky Man'', Fox wrote that he did not take his medication prior to his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee in 1998; "I had made a deliberate choice to appear before the subcommittee without medication. It seemed to me that this occasion demanded that my testimony about the effects of the disease, and the urgency we as a community were feeling, be seen as well as heard. For people who had never observed me in this kind of shape, the transformation must have been startling".<ref>[http://www.michaeljfox.org/about_aboutMichael_inHisOwnWords_excerpt.cfm Excerpt from ''Lucky Man,'' Chapter 8: Unwrapping the Gift].  From michaeljfox.org, accessed on February 08, 2010.</ref>

In an April 2002 [[NPR]] interview,<ref name="NPR Fresh Air"/> Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview: "Well, actually, I've been erring on the side of caution&nbsp;<U+2014> I think 'erring' is actually the right word&nbsp;<U+2014> in that I've been medicating perhaps too much, in the sense times the symptoms that people see in some of these interviews that have been on are actually [[dyskinesia]], which is a reaction to the medication. Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do...I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough Sinemet in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.' I say, Well, you sit across from [[Larry King]] and see if you want to tempt it."

In 2006, Fox starred in a [[campaign ad]] for [[Claire McCaskill]] expressing her support for [[stem cell research]]. In the ad, he visibly showed the effects of his Parkinson's medication. "As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research. In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures. Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope. They say all politics is local, but that's not always the case. What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans, Americans like me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6083472.stm |title=Michael J Fox makes stem cell ads |publisher=The BBC |date=October 25, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=2121909n |title=Michael J.
