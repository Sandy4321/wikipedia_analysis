'''D.C. United''' is an [[United States|American]] professional [[association football|soccer]] club located in [[Washington, D.C.]] that participates in [[Major League Soccer]], the [[United States]]' top-tier soccer league. The team's home field is the 45,596-seat [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]], owned by the District of Columbia and located on the [[Anacostia River]]. The team has proposed building a new 24,000-seat [[D.C.

Players such as [[Jaime Moreno]], [[Christian G<U+00F3>mez]], and [[Marco Etcheverry]] are among the team's most successful stars. D.C. United has a strong fan base, with three supporters' clubs and one of the highest attendance averages in Major League Soccer.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/29/AR2005072901752.html |title= New United Investors Win Trust |first= Steven |last= Goff |date= July 30, 2005 |work= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate= 2009-04-11}}</ref> The club's official nickname is the "Black-and-Red" and home uniforms are black and white with accents of red.

==History==
Prior to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the [[United States Soccer Federation]] fulfilled promises to [[FIFA]] by aiding in the foundation of a new professional league. On June 15, 1994, [[Major League Soccer]] selected [[Washington, D.C.]] out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the first seven teams, with three more added before the league's launch.<ref name=overview>{{cite web |url= http://web.mlsnet.com/about/ |title= General Overview |work= [[Major League Soccer]] |year= 2009 |accessdate= 2009-06-26}}</ref> The team's name was chosen as a reflection of European team names such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] or [[Newcastle United]]. D.C. United however departs from the common British practice in which "United" may refer to a club formed by the union of two existing constituent clubs.<ref name=united>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/korea-sport-footballculture-names-explain-3.htm |title=Football Culture.

[[Image:RFK.jpg|left|thumb|D.C. United won the 2004 Eastern Conference championship in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history.]]
On April 6, 1996, D.C. United played in the league's inaugural match against the [[San Jose Clash]] in [[Spartan Stadium (San Jose)|Spartan Stadium]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=overview/> In the league's early years, D.C. was the most successful of all the teams. [[Bruce Arena]], the club's first coach, led the team to the first "double" in modern U.S. soccer history in 1996, beating the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] to take the first [[MLS Cup]] and the [[USL First Division]] club the [[Rochester Raging Rhinos]] to win the [[U.S. Open Cup]]. D.C. repeated its MLS Cup victory in 1997 against the [[Colorado Rapids]], with the match hosted at RFK Stadium. The team also saw early successes in [[CONCACAF]] competitions, winning both the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup|Champions' Cup]] and the [[Interamerican Cup]] in 1998.<ref name=trophey/>

In October 1998, Arena left the team to direct [[United States men's national soccer team|the U.S. men's national team]]. Arena's departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team's fortunes.<ref name=FIFA/> While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach [[Thomas Rongen]], lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen's departure and his replacement by [[Ray Hudson]] in 2002. The team did not, however, fare much better under Hudson, and [[Piotr Nowak]] replaced him before the start of the 2004 season.<ref name=tradition>{{cite web |url= http://web.mlsnet.com/t103/load.jsp?section=about&content=tradition |title= D.C.

On November 18, 2003, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] made sports history by signing [[Freddy Adu]], a 14-year-old soccer prodigy and on January 16, 2004 he was officially selected by United with the first pick in the [[2004 MLS SuperDraft]]. When Adu entered United's regular-season opener as a second-half substitute on April 3, 2004, he became the youngest player in any professional sport in the United States since 1887.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6169400.stm |title= Doubts raised in US over Adu move |first= Matt |last= Slater |work= [[BBC News]] |date= November 22, 2006 |accessdate= 2009-06-27}}</ref> On December 11, 2006, D.C.

== Colors and badge ==
[[Image:DCUnitedOld.png|thumb|upright|Logo used from 1996 to 1998]]
The teams colors and original logo were announced on October 17, 1995 along with those of the other ten original teams during a presentation in [[New York City]].<ref name=overview/> Black and white are D.C. United's primary colors, though the team's nickname is the "Black-and-Red." Red is used to accent the home jersey while white is the main color of the team's away uniforms. Three stripes along the shoulder, in white at home and black on the road, represent the three jurisdictions of the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Virginia]], and [[Maryland]].  Before the team's current sponsorship deal with [[Volkswagen]], three strips were also used on the front of the jerseys.<ref name=tradition/> The team has also previously used white away uniforms with red stripes. White and red are the colors of the [[flag of Washington, D.C.]], and the stripes are also reminiscent of those used on the flag. [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeepers]] usually distinguish themselves with light blue colored shirts.

The team's original shield was implemented in 1996 consisting of the team's name, D.C. United, above a black [[Bald Eagle]] facing right on a red field, clawing three [[soccer ball]]s overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were again intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The bird, associated with the federal government based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. The current design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers, similar to the stripes on the uniform. At the center of the eagle is a single gold colored star and soccer ball, which represents the team's victory in [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[MLS Cup 1996|inaugural cup in 1996]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/dc-united-sc |title= D.C. United S.C. |work= FootballCrests.com |first= Doug |last= Hicks |accessdate= 2009-06-06}}</ref> The logo can also be adorned with four gold stars above it, representing the [[MLS Cup]]s the team has won.

== Stadium ==
[[File:RFK Stadium from Washington Metro.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] has been home to D.C. United for the team's entire existence.]]
[[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] (RFK) has been home to D.C. United since the team's founding in 1996. RFK was built in 1961 as a dual use [[baseball]] and [[American football]] stadium. Prior to 1996, it periodically hosted soccer matches, including the 1980 [[Soccer Bowl]], the 1993 [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and five matches during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. When the [[Washington Nationals]] baseball team shared the field from 2005 to 2007, there were criticisms regarding problems with the playing surface and even the dimensions of the field.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16346-2005Apr26.html |first= Steven |last= Goff |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= April 26, 2005 |accessdate= 2009-05-27}}</ref> The D.C.

In July 2006, D.C. United proposed building a new stadium along the [[Anacostia River]] as part of a redevelopment plan for [[Anacostia Park]]. However disputes with the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] over the proposal forced the team to consider other sites.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/20/AR2007072002470_pf.html |title= Talks Fall Apart On Stadium for D.C.

D.C. United has three major fan associations, [[La Barra Brava]], the [[Screaming Eagles (MLS supporters association)|Screaming Eagles]], and [[La Norte]]. Each group has a designated section of the home stadium. La Barra Brava, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "The Brave Fans," was founded in 1995 by [[Latino]] fans in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area, mostly [[Bolivia]]n immigrants in support of original United players [[Marco Etcheverry]] and [[Jaime Moreno]].

The two teams compete annually for the [[Atlantic Cup]], a competition instituted by the two teams' management that goes to the team that gets the most points across the teams' three meetings throughout the year.
