'''Mirrorthrone''' is a one-man [[Avant-garde metal]] band formed by Vladimir Cochet in 2000.

==Biography==
Mirrorthrone came into being in 2000, created by Vladimir Cochet, the only member of the one man project. In late 2001 and 2002, two demo CD's were recorded, which drew the attention of Red Stream Inc. After signing to Red Stream Inc. The first Mirrothrone album was ''[[Of Wind and Weeping]]''. It was received very well by the metal underground and others. The follow-up album, ''[[Carriers of Dust]]'' followed in 2006, and received even more positive reviews.

==Controversy==
The lyrics to "A Scream to Express the Hate of a Race" were frequently misinterpreted as being racist. As a result, Vladimir issued the following statement on Mirrorthrone's website:

:This is an answer to the polemic which is current at the moment on the Internet. '''No, Mirrorthrone is NOT racist, nazi, white pride or whatever you call it.''' The lyrics of the song "A Scream to Express the Hate of a Race" target the human race in its entirety. It attacks what is called the "nihilism" of a certain form of society that has been spreading around the globe and that envelops the "moral, social, religious and scientific" paradigms. I am not going to develop more for my aim is not to offer text analysis of what I have written; I only want to clarify the situation. Please read and understand at least a minimum before commenting. <ref name="Racism">[http://www.mirrorthrone.com/index.php?page=01 MirrorThrone.com]</ref>
