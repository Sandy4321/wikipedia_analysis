The '''Big Four Bridge''' is an abandoned six-span [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad]] [[truss bridge]] that crosses the [[Ohio River]], connecting [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], United States. It was completed in 1895, and updated in 1929. It has its largest [[span (architecture)|span]] at {{convert|547|ft}}, for {{convert|2525|ft|m}} in total. It gets its name from the defunct [[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]], which was nicknamed the "Big Four Railroad". 

Access to the Big Four Bridge is currently limited, as the access ways onto the bridge for the general public were removed in 1969, earning the Big Four Bridge the nickname '''"Bridge That Goes Nowhere"'''.  The bridge is presently being converted into a bicycle/pedestrian crossing. The [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] downstream, which carries [[U.S. 31]] across the river, is presently the only bridge allowing bicyclists and pedestrians travel between Louisville and its Indiana suburbs of [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]], [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]], and Jeffersonville.

==Description==
The Big Four Bridge is a six-span bridge, totaling {{convert|2525|ft|m|abbr=on}} long,<ref>{{cite book |last=Longest |first=David E. |title=Railroad Depots of Southern Indiana |url=http://books.google.com/?id=G8sddkoqS-gC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12 |year=2005 |publisher=Arcadia |isbn=0738539589}}</ref> with a clearance of {{convert|53|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The northernmost span is a [[rivet]]ed, eight-panel Parker through [[truss]]. The next three spans are {{convert|547|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, and are riveted, sixteen-panel Pennsylvania through trusses. The two southern spans are riveted, 10-panel Parker through trusses.<ref name = bh>{{cite web|url=http://bridgehunter.com/ky/jefferson/big-four/ |title=Bridgehunter - Big Four Railroad Bridge - Facts|publisher=BridgeHunter.com|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> It carried a [[single track (rail)|single track]] of railway.

==History==
[[Image:Old Big 4 Bridge.jpg|thumb|Photo of ''Big Four Bridge in Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana'', published in 1909]]  
The Big Four Bridge was first conceived in Jeffersonville in 1885 by various city interests. The Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was formed in 1887 to construct the Big Four Bridge, after a charter by the state of [[Indiana]]; Kentucky also chartered the company in 1888. The riverboat industry, a big economic factor in Jeffersonville, had requested that the bridge be built further upstream from the [[Falls of the Ohio]], but the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] approved the building site, even after the vocal protestations.<ref name="kleber">{{cite book|author=Kleber, John E.|title=Encyclopedia of Louisville|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813121000|year=2000|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pXbYITw4ZesC|page=89}}</ref>

===Construction===
Construction began on October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge would be the only Louisville bridge with serious accidents during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson.<ref name="kleber" />

The Big Four Bridge had one of the biggest bridge disasters in the United States, occurring on December 15, 1893 when a construction crane was dislodged by a severe wind, causing the [[falsework]] support of a truss to be damaged and the truss&mdash;with forty-one workers on it&mdash;to fall into the Ohio River. Twenty of the workers survived, but twenty-one died. The accident almost cost more lives, as a ferry crossing the Ohio River just barely missed being hit by the truss. Hours later, a span next to the damaged span also fell into the river, but was abandoned at the time, causing no injuries. As a result, falsework was longitudely reinforced to prevent further occurrences, and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on the bottom frame of the truss. Also, a new rule was enforced: "never trust a bolted joint any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place".<ref name="kleber"/>

The Big Four Bridge was finally completed in September 1895. Because of the location of the bridge and the growth of the [[Kennedy Interchange]], the interchange had to avoid the columns that were on the approach to the bridge, causing the interchange to have several two-lane ramps rather than a single stretch of highway, and helped earn the nickname [[Spaghetti Junction]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Chip Nold, Julie Segal, James Nold, Bob Bahr|title=The Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Ky & Southern Indiana|publisher=Published and distributed by Insiders' Pub.|isbn=1573800430|url= http://books.google.com/?id=LEOE3_1PUgwC|page=30|year=1997|location=Manteo, NC}}</ref> Due to the various accidents, the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was financially strapped after building the bridge, and later in 1895 sold it to the [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]-based [[Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]], also known as the Big Four Railroad. This gave the railway its first entry into the Louisville market, although the railroad would have likely used the bridge even if they had not bought it, as they desired access to Louisville.<ref name="kleber"/>

===Rail operation===
One effect of the opening of the Big Four Bridge was increased transportation of freight by rail, significantly decreasing the number of [[Packet (sea transport)|packet boats]] that at one time crossed the Ohio River by the dozens.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schrage, Robert. |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5yZ7olmuaAgC |title=Along the Ohio River:Cincinnati to Louisville|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=073854308X|year=2006|page=52}}</ref>

On February 19, 1904, a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]] train accidentally crossed the Big Four Bridge, due to engineer Dick Foreman falling asleep and going the wrong way at [[Otisco, Indiana]]. The fireman kept shoveling [[coal]] and did not pay attention. It was the [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]] that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back up all the way back to Otisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F06EFD91E3AE733A25753C2A9649C946597D6CF |title=ASLEEP AT THE THROTTLE.; Train Takes Wrong Route While Engineer Naps for an Hour|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|year= February 20, 1904|accessdate=2008-06-10 | format=PDF}}</ref>

On September 12, 1905, the first [[interurban]] crossed the Big Four Bridge. In January 1918, two interurbans collided on the Big Four Bridge, killing three and injuring twenty aboard.<ref>{{Cite document |url=http://books.google.com/?id=I4-LGQAACAAJ |title=An Informal History of Clark County, Indiana  |author=Gerald O.

Due to the increasing weight of the rail traffic, contracts were finalized in June 1928 to build a bigger Big Four Bridge, which opened on June 25, 1929. The new Big Four Bridge was built on the piers of the old bridge, a "novel building process", as it sped up the time necessary to build the new bridge; the old one served to reinforce the new one as it was being built. The old piers would still be used, but the falsework was entirely removed. During construction, the Big Four Bridge's usual rail traffic was routed over the [[Kentucky & Indiana Terminal Bridge]]. The interurbans that used the Big Four Bridge would instead disembark at [[Sellersburg, Indiana]] and have the passengers board buses into Louisville for the duration of the Big Four's reconstruction.<ref name="kleber"/>

===Ownership===
In 1988 [[Oscar Arias]], [[President of Costa Rica]], contacted Louisville mayor [[Jerry Abramson]] to inquire about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in [[Costa Rica]], as he believed it would be cheaper to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through.<ref>{{cite news|title=Costa Rican may want to buy Big Four Bridge, move it south|author=McDonough, Rick|date=1988-06-30|pages=1B|publisher=''[[Courier-Journal]]''}}</ref>

==Post-railway use==
[[Image:Big Four Bridge HAER 071206.jpg|thumb|300px|1975 picture of bridge]] 
The Big Four Bridge fell into disuse after the Big Four Railroad's parent company, the [[New York Central Railroad]], was merged into the [[Penn Central]] in 1968. The Big Four Bridge's former traffic was then routed over Louisville's [[14th Street Bridge (Ohio River)|Fourteenth Street Bridge]]. By 1969 both approach spans had been removed and sold for scrap. As a result, the Big Four Bridge became the first Louisville bridge to fall out of use, and gained the nickname "Bridge That Goes Nowhere".<ref name="kleber"/><ref name="Heim"/>

During the 1970s and 1980s, local radio station [[WLRS]]-102 FM lit up the Big Four Bridge as part of their "Bridge the Gap" [[Christmas]] promotion, which was used as a fund raiser for needy local families. Some of the lights spelled out "LRS 102".

After unsuccessful litigation to stop the project, the Big Four Bridge is, as of 2006, in the process of being converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of [[Louisville Waterfront Park]] and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion has been proposed and planned since the 1990s; funding is unclear as of 2007, although it may be funded as a part of the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]]. The [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] has pledged $1&nbsp;million for the project to build a ramp to the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville has pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8&nbsp;million, but is likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp is expected to cost $4&nbsp;million, but the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge is expected to cost $3&nbsp;million and take 18&nbsp;months, but funds are still dependent on the federal budget. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the [[Spring Street Freight House]]. However, the mayor of [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], [[Tom Galligan]], called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that the building of the column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the [[United States Coast Guard]] nor the Army Corps of Engineers have approved of the planned rampway.  Galligan said he would rather have a ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge.  Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an [[elevator]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Courier-Journal|title=Bridges money may be shifted|last=Shafer|first=Sheldon|date=2007-03-05}}</ref><ref>[http://www.news-tribune.net/clarkcounty/local_story_053124824.html Jeffersonville officials want redesigns for Big Four project] by David Mann ''[[The Evening News (Jeffersonville)|The Evening News]]'' February 27, 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-tribune.net/local/local_story_134114252.html |title=Workers will examine Big Four next month; not anticipating structural damage after fire|location= Jeffersonville|publisher= Evening News|date= May 13, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

The plans for bicycling include a suspension ramp that would allow bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due to the length of time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during [[Thunder Over Louisville]], bicyclists prefer the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kycyclist.org/mar2007/0061.html |title=Kentucky Cycling List Big Four Bridge Letter] |author= Jonathan Villines |publisher=Bicycle & Pedestrian Coordinator Louisville Metro Government|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

During Thunder Over Louisville, the Big Four Bridge sets the limit on how close private boats can get to the fireworks, which are centered two bridges away on the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge.

==Fires==
[[Image:Big 4 Fire VI.jpg|thumb|300px|Closeup of May 7, 2008 fire]] 

Since its closing, the bridge has seen occasional fires; two in the 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008. In 1987 Christmas lights posted on the bridge to promote a toy drive started the fire; both the Jeffersonville and Louisville Fire Departments fought six to eight hours to put out the blaze.<ref name="evening news">{{cite web|url=http://www.news-tribune.net/clarkcounty/local_story_129105311.html?keyword=secondarystory |title=Big Four Bridge fire<U+2019>s cause, damage not yet determined|author= David Mann|publisher= ''[[The Evening News (Jeffersonville)|The Evening News]]'' May 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref name="fire">{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080507/ZONE07/80507016 |title=Boat used to battle Big Four blaze|author= Jessie Halladay|publisher=[[Courier Journal]]'' May 7, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> 

On May 7, 2008 the bridge caught fire a quarter-mile (400&nbsp;m) north of the Louisville end, shortly after noon, {{convert|70|to|80|ft|abbr=on}} above the Ohio River;<ref name="fire"/> suspected to have started from an electrical problem.  This fire had more troubles due to the age and condition of the bridge; the wood tresses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters were not to be sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose which could reach the blaze upon the bridge. 

It took two and a half hours to control the fire. Navigation lights used for the heavy barge traffic were being changed at the time of the report, according to Mike Kimmel of Louisville Waterfront Development.  The Coast Guard shut down river traffic for about a mile around the bridge because debris was falling off the aging bridge.  An official determination on the cause of the fire was expected in June 2008.<ref name="wlky">{{cite web|url=http://www.wlky.com/news/16193470/detail.html |title=Crew Extinguish Big Four Blaze|publisher=[[WLKY-TV]] May 7, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080508/ZONE01/80508015/-1/NLETTER07 |title=Big Four Bridge check a month off|publisher= ''[[Courier-Journal]]'' May 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-tribune.net/local/local_story_134114252.html |title=Workers will examine Big Four next month; not anticipating structural damage after fire|publisher= ''(Jeffersonville) Evening News'' May 13, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>{{updateafter}}

By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway.<ref>http://www.whas11.com/topstories/stories/whas11-090717-localnews-big-four.4d9f5d31.html</ref>
