'''South Portland''' is a city in [[Cumberland County, Maine| Cumberland County]], [[Maine]], [[United States]], and is the fourth-largest city in the state. Founded in 1895, as of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the city population was 23,324. Known for its working waterfront, South Portland is situated on Portland Harbor and overlooks the skyline of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and the islands of Casco Bay. Due to South Portland's close proximity to air, marine and highway transportation options, the city has become a center for retail and industry in the region. 

South Portland is a principal city of the [[Portland, Maine|Portland]]&ndash;South Portland&ndash;[[Biddeford, Maine|Biddeford]], Maine [[Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
[[Image:Libertyshipportland.jpg|thumb|left|Liberty ships being built along the waterfront (August 1942)]]
South Portland was first settled in 1630, and it grew to become a small residential community with many farms. On March 15, 1895, it was incorporated as a town after it broke away from [[Cape Elizabeth]], based on a disagreement on a future source of public drinking water.  Three years later South Portland became a city, destined to receive its drinking water, like Portland, from [[Sebago Lake]], while Cape Elizabeth used wells or other local sources.

In 1940, the Todd-Bath Iron Shipbuilding Corp (later called the <U+201C>East Yard<U+201D>) was established to build cargo ships for Britain. When the United States became involved with World War II, the shipyard expanded to include the South Portland Shipbuilding Corp. (aka the <U+201C>West Yard<U+201D>), that later combined with the Todd-Bath yard to become the [[New England Shipbuilding Corporation]]. These shipyards built 236 of the 440 foot (134 m) long [[Liberty ship]]s, more than 10 percent of all the Liberty ships constructed during the war years. At its peak, the shipyard employed some 30,000 people, including thousands of women, who took over the jobs vacated by men going into the service. The shipyard gradually ceased operations after the war ended in 1945.  Remnants of the shipyards are visible, and there is a memorial to the shipyard and the workers at Bug Light Park. The park is also home to [[Portland Breakwater Lighthouse]], commonly referred to as "Bug Light". 

On South Portland's waterfront is [[Fort Preble]], which is a military fort established in 1808 to protect Portland Harbor. It was in operation during several American conflicts, including the [[United States Civil War]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. Nearby Fort Preble is [[Spring Point Ledge Light]], which was constructed by the federal government in 1897 to mark a dangerous rock ledge.

Over the last few decades, South Portland has become the retail capital of Maine. The Mill Creek shopping center, built in the 1950s, was the first such "strip mall" built in Maine: a line of stores under one long roof and a covered walkway.  Mill Creek has changed and grown significantly since, but the original layout still forms the core of the stores. The area in Mill Creek known as the Waterfront Market sits at the base of the [[Casco Bay Bridge]] and attracts shoppers from Scarborough, Cape Elizabeth and Portland. 

The need for a large mall in Maine emerged in the 1960s, as Portland's downtown district could not accommodate the growing retail market. A former pig farm in South Portland was chosen as the site for the project because it was close to I-95 and convenient from Portland. Beginning construction of the [[Maine Mall]] in the late 1960s marked the start of a major transition in the western part of South Portland: from a rural, agrarian landscape to the large retail center that exists today.

The oldest neighborhood in South Portland, and its former "retail corridor," is Ferry Village. Prior to the Casco Bay Bridge (or the one it replaced, the Million Dollar Bridge), ferries transported people and goods back and forth across the harbor to Portland. The landscape and the makeup of residents in Ferry Village were forever changed upon the close of the WWII shipyards. The Village has slowly bounced back and is now one of the more popular places in the city to live. 

Ferry Village also has one of the most active and involved neighborhood associations in Southern Maine. The [http://www.ferryvillageme.org/ Ferry Village Neighboorhood Conservation Association] (FVNCA) was formed in August 1985 to address the development boom in the 1980s which was quickly altering the character of the waterfront and many Greater Portland neighborhoods. FVNCA was instrumental in the formation of the [http://www.splandtrust.org/ South Portland Land Trust] as well as the City-managed Land Bank which provides seed money for the acquisition of available open space.

== Government and politics ==
South Portland utilizes a [[council-manager]] form of government.<ref>{{cite web | title=South Portland - City Council | url=http://www.southportland.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={0A44608D-885E-4B6C-9D32-D9DA33DC2D90} | work=City of South Portland | accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web | title=South Portland - Executive | url=http://southportland.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={FF753AA8-A088-4448-9E29-485925ADF3A7} | work=City of South Portland | accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>

The [[city council]] is made up of seven members elected by the citizens: one member from each of the five districts in the city, and two [[at-large]] members. Voters are allowed to vote for council candidates in all five districts, not just the district where they are registered to vote. 

The members of the council elect one of themselves as [[mayor]], which is primarily a ceremonial title. The mayor serves as chairman of the council. 

The city council is responsible for establishing [[policy]], passing [[local ordinance]]s, voting [[appropriation]]s, and developing an overall vision for the city.

The council appoints a [[city manager]] to oversee the daily operations of the government and implement the policies established by the council. The manager is an employee of the city and has a [[contract]] that specifies his or her duties and responsibilities. Ideally, the manager is considered [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|apolitical]].

=== Mayoral controversy ===
In December 2007, then-mayor James Soule made headlines around Maine and around the country when he proposed in his inaugural address that South Portland, along with the rest of coastal southern Maine, should [[secede]] from the state of Maine and form a new state.<ref>{{cite news |first=Josie |last=Huang |title=Mayor calls for secession from Maine |work=Portland Press Herald |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |url=http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/story.php?id=152570 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |first=Jenna |last=Russell |title=Mayor says Maine should be two states |work=Boston Globe |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/12/30/mayor_says_maine_should_be_two_states/ }}</ref> Soule referred to the state of Maine as an "oppressive regime" and said that South Portland, along with other coastal southern Maine cities and towns, contributes much more to the state than it receives in return. 

Soule's proposal was panned by the congressional delegation and by the governor, who called it "silly" and "counterproductive."

The proposal did not gain any traction, and Soule has not pursued it since then. Soule nominated himself for reelection as mayor in November 2008, but was defeated by Thomas Blake in a 6-1 vote. Soule voted for himself.<ref>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Hersey |title=Blake Wins Caucus By 6-1 Vote |work=The South Portlander |date=24 November 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2009 |url=http://www.southportlander.com/index.php/article/blake_wins_caucus_by_6_1_vote/ }}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 14.3&nbsp;[[square mile]]s (37.0&nbsp;[[km<U+00B2>]]), of which, 12.0&nbsp;square miles (31.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 2.3&nbsp;square miles (6.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (16.15%) is water.
