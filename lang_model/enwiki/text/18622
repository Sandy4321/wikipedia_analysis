'''211 North Ervay''' is a [[high rise]] located at 211 North Ervay Street in the [[City Center District, Dallas, Texas|City Center District]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The building rises 250 [[Foot (length)|feet]] (132 meters) and contains 20 floors of office space. The colorful building of [[Mid-Century modern|mid-twentieth century design]] is situated on a prominent city corner and adjacent to [[Thanks-Giving Square]].

==History==

The building was designed by architects Hedrick & Stanley for developer Leo Corrigan as his fourth major downtown office building (after the [[Corrigan Building]], [[Burt Tower]] and [[Adolphus Tower]]). The tower was built on a slim corner lot, 50 feet in width and 200 feet long, and replaced early commercial structures. Adjacent to the structure was the Palace Theater, one of many on Elm Street's historic Theater Row.<ref>"Corrigan Announces New 20-Story Building". ''The Dallas Morning News''. May 24, 1957.</ref>

The building's facade was covered with continuous glass windows along with alternating azure and aquamarine porcelain spandrels. The colorful design was a popular way to add color to otherwise bland urban skylines of the mid-twentieth century.<ref>http://dallaslibrary.org/texas/photogallery/downtownliving/211northervay.htm Dallas Public Library</ref> The ground floor, containing the main entrance on Ervay, was covered in granite and recessed to provide extra sidewalk width for street level retail space; the second floor was covered in mosaics. Opened in 1958 as a general office building, it was popular with insurance companies, law firms, and aviation-related companies. 

The building was sold in 1971 and 1977; the second sale resulted in a complete remodeling of the lobby, elevators and changes in the exterior facade of the first two levels.<ref>"211 N. Ervay Building Sold". ''The Dallas Morning News''. August 6, 1971.</ref><ref>"Group Buys Building at 211 North Ervay". ''The Dallas Morning News''. September 4, 1977.</ref> Over successive years occupancy rates slowly declined as modern skyscrapers  such as [[1700 Pacific]], [[Thanksgiving Tower]] and [[Comerica Bank Tower]] surrounded the building. The building was sold again in 1986, and by 1995 it was completely vacant.<ref>Steve Brown. "DOWNTOWN BUILDING ACQUIRED." The Dallas Morning News 21 Nov. 1986, HOME FINAL, BUSINESS: 1D. NewsBank.

In response, Preservation Dallas included the building in its inaugural list of Dallas<U+2019> Most Endangered Historic Places, citing its importance in the National Register's [[Dallas Downtown Historic District]] and an example of the vanishing "cool blue" architecture of the 1950s<ref>STEVE BROWN.

In 2005 3J Development purchased the building and planned to convert the building into residential units. The renovation plan, abandoned in 2007, would have altered the facade and removed the distinctive blue panels.<ref>STEVE BROWN. "211 N.
