As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there are 94,673 people, 39,596 households, and 16,788 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] is 1,499.9/km<U+00B2> (3,884.1/sq&nbsp;mi), making Boulder's population density higher than [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]'s and among the highest in the state; of Colorado's twenty-one largest cities, only [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]] and [[Northglenn, Colorado|Northglenn]] (two close-in Denver suburbs) have greater population densities. There are 40,726 housing units at an average density of 1,670.8/sq&nbsp;mi (645.2/km<U+00B2>). The racial makeup of the city is 88.33% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 1.22% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.48% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 4.02% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.05% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.50% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.40% from two or more races. 8.9% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino/Latina]] of any race.

There are 39,596 households out of which 20.0% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 33.3% are [[marriage|married couples]] living together, 6.5% have a female householder with no husband present, and 57.6% are non-families. 33.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 6.2% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.20 and the average family size is 2.84.

Boulder's population is younger than the national average, largely due to the presence of university students. The median age is 29 years compared to the U.S. median of 35.1 years.<ref>{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet - Boulder, Colorado (General Characteristics) | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=ChangeGeoContext&geo_id=16000US0807850&_geoContext=&_street=&_county=boulder&_cityTown=boulder&_state=04000US08&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010}}</ref> In Boulder, 14.8% of the residents are under the age of 18, 25.9% from 18 to 24, 33.0% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 7.8% are 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females there are 106.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and older, there are 107.4 males.

According to a 2007 estimate, the median household income in Boulder is $50,209, and the median family income is $85,807.<ref>{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet - Boulder, Colorado (Social Characteristics) | publisher = United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=16000US0807850&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US08%7C16000US0807850&_street=&_county=boulder&_cityTown=boulder&_state=04000US08&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=160&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry=}}</ref> Males have a median income of $41,829 versus $32,100 for females.

Out of the total population, 10.4% of those under the age of 18 and 6.5% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. The higher population poverty line is due to the large number of college [[students]] living in the area.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Flatirons Winter Sunrise edit 2.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Boulder's iconic rock formations, the [[Flatirons]].]]
The City of Boulder is in Boulder Valley where the [[Rocky Mountains]] meet the [[Great Plains]]. Just west of the city are imposing slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, known as the [[Flatirons]]. The Flatirons are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.

The primary water flow through the city is [[Boulder Creek (Colorado)|Boulder Creek]]. The creek was named well ahead of the city's founding, for all of the large granite boulders that have cascaded into the creek over the eons. It is from Boulder Creek that Boulder City and hence Boulder is believed to have taken its name. Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city. The creek is a tributary of the [[South Platte River]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 25.4&nbsp;square miles (65.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>). 24.4&nbsp;square miles (63.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 1.0&nbsp;square miles (2.6&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (3.94%) is water.

The [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]] (40 degrees north latitude) runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as Baseline Road today.

Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath Flagstaff Mountain just a few miles east of the continental divide and about 30 miles northwest of Denver.  Arapahoe glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.<ref>[http://bcn.boulder.co.us/basin/ Boulder Area Sustainability Information Network]</ref> The climate in Boulder is typically mild with dry, moderate summers and relatively comfortable winters. The city boasts more than 300 sunny or mostly sunny days each year.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2004-06-21-fla-sunshine_x.htm usatoday] 
</ref>  Nearby mountains shield Boulder from the most severe winter storms. Most precipitation occurs during the winter and spring months, with snowfall averaging 83.1&nbsp;inches. Snow can fall as late as May.

Boulder's winters are somewhat mild, and although large amounts of snow can fall, the effects of [[orographic lift]] usually dry out the air passing over the Front Range, shadowing the city from precipitation for much of the season. Temperatures during the winter generally average between 45<U+00B0>F (7<U+00B0>C) to 50<U+00B0>F (10<U+00B0>C) for the daytime highs, and overnight the temperatures plunge to typically settle between 17<U+00B0>F (-8<U+00B0>C) and 23<U+00B0>F (-5<U+00B0>C). These rather cold temperatures that occur overnight are mostly due to Boulder's "High-Desert" climate. Additionally, warm chinook winds occur as air passing over the mountains heats as it descends, in addition to the sunshine, quickly melting most snow accumulations and making Boulder's winters relatively mild.

The summer months in Boulder are warm, with daytime highs averaging between 80<U+00B0>F (27<U+00B0>C) and 90<U+00B0>F (32<U+00B0>C), and occasional days reaching 95<U+00B0>F (35<U+00B0>C) not uncommon. Lows in the summer are in the 50<U+00B0>F (10<U+00B0>C) - 60<U+00B0>F (16<U+00B0>C) range; rather cold due to Boulder's altitude and wind patterns.

The all time highest recorded temperature in Boulder of 104<U+00B0>F (40<U+00B0>C) occurred on June 23 and July 11, 1954. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Boulder was -24<U+00B0>F (-31<U+00B0>C), which occurred on February 5, 1989, and December 22, 1990.

==History==
[[File:Boulder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pearl Street Mall in Boulder]]
In the early to mid 1800s, the nomadic Southern [[Arapaho]] Native American tribe frequently wintered at the base of the foothills in the Boulder area. [[Chief Niwot]] and his band called the site their home. Other nomadic tribes included the Utes, Cheyennes, Comanches, and Sioux. 

The first recorded European settlers in the area were gold prospectors who arrived in 1858, when Boulder was part of the Nebraska Territory (The former boundary between Nebraska and Kansas territories is the present Baseline Road in Boulder).  The "Boulder City Town Company" was founded on February 10, 1859. Boulder's first school house was built in 1860, followed by the creation of the Colorado Territory in 1861. In 1871 then 'Boulder City' was incorporated. In 1873 the railroad was extended to Boulder and, in 1890, the [[Boulder Railroad Depot]] was constructed to serve as a station for the [[Union Pacific]] Railroad. In 1876 Colorado was granted statehood, and in that same year the University of Colorado at Boulder opened.

Mining gold, silver, and coal continued to be a prominent part of the local economy until the mid 1900s. A coal miners strike lasted from 1910 to 1915, causing a military presence in nearby [[Louisville, Colorado|Louisville]]. Mining's relevance in the local economy declined in the 1940s, when the city began actively recruiting clean industry, such as the National Bureau of Standards, which today is the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. (Home of the [[atomic clock]].)

Streetcars operated in Boulder from the late 1800s through 1931. [http://www.boulderbreeze.org/ A lobbying group exists] today to restore the streetcar to Boulder, albeit with a new route.

Boulder adopted an anti-saloon ordinance in 1907.<ref>{{cite web | title = A Boulder Timeline | publisher = Boulder History Museum | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | url = http://www.boulderhistorymuseum.org/history.timeline.html }}</ref> Statewide prohibition started in Colorado in 1916 and ended with the repeal of [[Prohibition|national prohibition]] in 1933.[http://www.ghostseekers.com/Timeline.htm]

Boulder was the second city in the United States to implement the Hare (or [[Single Transferable Vote]]) method of voting in 1917. It was repealed in 1947. 

On January 19, 1952, the [[Denver-Boulder Turnpike]] opened as a tollway between Boulder and the northern [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] suburb of [[Westminster, Colorado|Westminster]]. In 1967, the bonds for building the highway were paid off early, its tollway status was lifted, and it became part of [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 36]]. (Many still refer to the road as the Denver-Boulder Turnpike or simply Boulder Turnpike, however.) [http://www.mesalek.com/colo/us36.html#dbt] 

==Politics and government ==
Politically, Boulder is one of the most Democratic cities in Colorado. [[Boulder County, Colorado|Boulder County]], which includes Boulder's more conservative suburbs, is 37% Democratic, 27% Republican, and 36% independent. [http://www.co.boulder.co.us/clerk/elections/history/registration.htm] Although in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], Democratic views are prevalent in city politics, Boulder has the more widespread reputation as a pocket of liberal political views within its largely conservative state, garnering the oft-used nickname "The People's Republic of Boulder."

In 1974 the Boulder City Council passed Colorado's first ordinance prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Boulder voters, however, repealed the measure by referendum within a year. In 1975, Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex was the second in the United States to ever grant [[same-sex marriage]] licenses, prior to state laws being passed to prevent such issuance. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/14/MNG3R517N51.DTL] In 1987, Boulder voters reversed their 1974 vote, and the city became the first in the United States to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation by a direct vote of the people. In 1996, Boulder became the first city in [[Colorado]] to enact a [[smoking ban]] that included bars.

Coexisting with the liberal tendencies of the population at large are the less numerous but politically active conservative and libertarian residents. [[Bob Greenlee]], a Republican, was briefly the mayor of Boulder and ran against [[Mark Udall]] in 1998 for [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]]. The [[Promise Keepers]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] organization for men, was conceived of in Boulder in 1990 by then-coach of the University of Colorado football team [[Bill McCartney]]. The organization has since relocated to [[Denver]].[http://www.promisekeepers.org/Contact/Contact%20National%20Headquarters.aspx]

===Outdoor sports===
[[Image:Bouldercolorado.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hiking trails and rock climbing in Boulder are very popular at Chautauqua park.]]
Boulder is surrounded by more than 36,000 acres (149&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of recreational open space, conservation easements, and nature preserves<ref>http://www.bouldercounty.org/openspace/about_us/abt_images/protected_land_statistics.pdf</ref>. There are ample opportunities for hiking, biking, running, and rock climbing. Many of the trails start at the edge of the city, while others are a short drive away. The trails vary in difficulty: some are quite easy while there are some that are technically challenging. A [http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2794&Itemid=1036 trail map] is available online or from a variety of local retailers. The [http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3073&Itemid=1922 City of Boulder Open Space] website is a great resource for information about outdoor activities and volunteer opportunities.

World-class rock climbing is found in nearby Eldorado Canyon, near the small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community of [[Eldorado Springs, Colorado|Eldorado Springs]], six miles south of Boulder. Eldorado Canyon is a wonder of natural beauty, but it is most famous for its hundreds of world-renowned rock climbing routes. There are also high quality climbing routes available in the city open space, including climbing routes of varying difficulty on the [[Flatirons]] themselves. Boulder Canyon, directly west of downtown Boulder, also has many good routes. All three of these areas are affected by seasonal closures for wildlife.

==Transportation==
===Mass Transit===
Boulder has an extensive bus system operated by the [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD). The HOP, SKIP, JUMP, BOUND, DASH and STAMPEDE routes run throughout the city and connect to nearby communities on a frequent basis, with departures every ten minutes during peak hours, Monday-Friday. Other routes, such as the 201, 203, 204, 205, 206, 208 and 209 depart every 15 to 30 minutes. Regional routes, traveling between nearby cities such as Longmont (BOLT, J), Golden (GS), and Denver (B/BX/DM/HX/S/T), as well as Denver International Airport (AB), are also available. There are over 100 scheduled buses that run between Boulder and Denver on weekdays.  Boulder will be connected to downtown Denver with a BRT or Bus Rapid Transit route along US-36. This is being funded by [[FasTracks]] and construction is expected to begin in 2009 and to be completed in 2016. A [[commuter rail]] route is set to run through Boulder to [[Longmont]], with the station being on the intersection of 30th and Pearl Streets. Route, schedule and fare information is available on the RTD Web site at http://www.rtd-denver.com/, or by calling their Telephone Information Center at 303-299-6000. Real time arrival information for the HOP route is available at http://www.nextbus.com. Google also offers a transit trip planner for the Boulder-Denver region at http://www.google.com/transit

Beginning in 2014, commuter rail will travel between Longmont, Boulder and Denver, with stops in major communities along the way. This commuter rail line is funded by [[FasTracks]], a transit improvement plan funded by a 0.4% increase in the sales tax throughout the Denver metro area. [[Regional Transportation District|RTD]], the developer of FasTracks, and the City of Boulder are planning a transit-oriented development near Pearl and 33rd Streets to accommodate a Boulder Fastracks station. The development will feature the relocated [[Boulder Railroad Depot]], which may be returned to a transit-related use.

===Cycling===
Boulder, well-known for its [[bicycle culture]], boasts hundreds of miles of bike paths, lanes, and routes that interconnect to create a renowned network of bikeways usable year-round. Boulder has 74 bike and pedestrian underpasses that facilitate safer and uninterrupted travel throughout much of the city. The city offers a route-finding website  that allows users to map personalized bike routes around the city[http://www.gobikeboulder.net/]. In 2008 the city was recognized by the [[League of American Bicyclists]] as a Platinum-level [[bicycle friendly]] community.

Walk and Bike Month is celebrated throughout June, with Bike to Work Day held on the last Wednesday in June. The event is presented by [http://www.goboulder.net GO Boulder] and is produced by [http://www.communitycycles.org Community Cycles]. Begun in 1977 as Bike to Work Day, Boulder's annual celebration of biking is believed to be one of the oldest in the United States.

==Growth management==
Government preservation of open space around Boulder began with the [[Congress of the United States]] approving the allocation of 1,800&nbsp;acres (7.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon in 1899.

Since then, Boulder has adopted a policy of controlled urban expansion. In 1959, city voters approved the "Blue Line" city-charter amendment which restricted city water service to altitudes below 5750 feet, in an effort to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax for the acquisition of open space in an effort to contain [[urban sprawl]]. In 1970, Boulder created a "comprehensive plan" that would dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban-planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents' views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. A Historic-Preservation Code was passed in 1974, and a ''residential-growth management'' ordinance (the Danish Plan) in 1976. [http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2100&Itemid=1674] [http://bcn.boulder.co.us/lwv/lwvknow.html]

===Wildlife protection===
[[Image:Prairie-dog1.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Prairie Dogs enjoy special protection in Boulder.]]
The City of Boulder has created an ''Urban Wildlife Management Plan'' which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife.[http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/planning/wildlife_plan/index.htm] Also, the city's parks department has a Conservation Team which monitors parks (including wetlands, lakes, etc) to protect ecosystems.[http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/parks-recreation/CONSERVATION_TEAM/conservation_team_main.htm] From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.[http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/openspace/visitor/closure/closure.htm]

Traditionally, Boulder has avoided the use of chemical [[pesticides]] for controlling the insect population. However, with the threat of [[West Nile Virus]], the city began an ''integrative'' [http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/environmentalaffairs/ipm/documents/FinalWNVMosquitoPlan.pdf plan] to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides. Residents can ''opt-out'' of the program by contacting the city and asking that their areas not be sprayed.[http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/environmentalaffairs/ipm/2005_WNVs.html]

Under Boulder law, extermination of [[prairie dogs]] requires a permit. [http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1688&Itemid=1412]

Also in 2005, the city experimented with using [[goat]]s for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse [[knapweed]] and [[Canada thistle]], and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in the future weed control projects.[http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/comm/pressrelease/2005/0524briefs.htm#ParksandRecreationtousegoatsfornaturalweedcontrol]

Brown. In 1974, Lund bought out Brown's share of the press, and Brown moved on to found ''Soldier of Fortune'' magazine the following year.[http://www.paladin-press.com/history.aspx]

Instituted in 1978, ''Boulder Magazine'' is a full-color, seasonal magazine that covers local events, outdoor activities and Boulder culture.

Boulder was one of the few cities in the U.S. to have a sustained underground (pirate) FM radio station. Called KBFR (Boulder Free Radio) it operated at 95.3FM and streamed live on the internet at www.kbfr.org. It was operated from April 2000 to Jan of 2005 when its founders, under pressure from the FCC, took it off the air. At its peak it had over 50 DJ's, and had an international following via the Internet.

==Shopping==

One of the most popular sections of Boulder is the famous [[Pearl Street Mall]], home to numerous shops and restaurants. This four-block pedestrian mall is a social hotspot in Boulder, with dozens of restaurants of all kinds and specialty stores that include artisan shops and unique gadget shops. In the summer and on weekends, many street shows and acts can be found throughout the mall, along with street vendors and henna tattoo artists.

Boulder's traditional Downtown area, including the [[Pearl Street Mall]], is in the western part of present-day Boulder. During the 1950s and 1960s, the city grew to the east, since the west side is bounded by the foothills. Downtown is host to a variety of restaurants, bars, and boutique stores. However, it has few grocery, hardware, or department stores and is therefore more of a "shopping destination" than a neighborhood with stores supporting the local population.

The [[Twenty Ninth Street (Boulder, Colorado)|Twenty Ninth Street]] retail district opened in October 2006, located in central Boulder on the site of the former Crossroads Mall, east of Downtown.

Near the [[Pearl Street Mall]] the [[Farmers' Market]] opens every Saturday morning and Wednesday evening, April through October on 13th Street next to Central Park. The market was started in 1986 by regional farmers.[http://www.boulderfarmers.org/about.html]
