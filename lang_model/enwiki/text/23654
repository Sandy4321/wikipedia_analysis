The '''Chesma''' (Russian: ''<U+0427><U+0435><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430>'', sometimes transliterated as '''Tchesma''') was the second ship of the {{sclass|Ekaterina II|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her [[waterline]] armor [[Belt armor|belt]] was submerged. Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. ''Chesma'' spent her career as part of the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

When the crew of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} mutinied in June 1905,<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> the ship's crew was considered unreliable and she did not participate in the pursuit of the ''Potemkin''. ''Chesma'' did, however, escort ''Potemkin'' as {{ship|Russian battleship|Sinop||2}} towed her back to [[Sevastopol]] from [[Constanta]], [[Romania]], where ''Potemkin'' had sought asylum. ''Chesma'' was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907. Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full-scale armour trials. She was re-designated as ''Stricken Vessel Nr. 4'' on 22 April 1912 before being used as a gunnery target. Afterwards the ship served as a torpedo target for the [[destroyer]]s of the Black Sea Fleet. During these attacks ''Chesma'' settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid-1920s.

==Design and description==
[[File:Ekaterina II class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1896.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1896</center>]]
''Chesma'' was {{convert|331|ft|8.5|in|m|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|339|ft|3|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|68|ft|11|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|28|ft|10|in|m|1}} more than {{convert|28|in}} than designed. She displaced {{convert|11396|LT|t|lk=on}} at load, over {{convert|1200|LT|MT|abbr=on}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|10181|LT|t|abbr=on}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 21</ref>

''Chesma'' had two 3-cylinder [[Compound engine|vertical compound steam engines]] imported from the Belgian [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> anonyme John Cockerill|Cockerill]] company. Fourteen cylindrical [[Boiler (steam generator)|boilers]], also imported from Cockerill, provided steam to the engines. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|9000|ihp|lk=on}}, but they produced {{convert|9059|ihp|abbr=on}} on trials and gave a top speed of almost {{convert|16|knots|lk=on}}. At full load she carried {{convert|900|LT|MT}} of coal that provided her a range of {{convert|2800|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}} and {{convert|1367|nmi}} at {{convert|14.5|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 21, 29<U+2013>30</ref>

She differed from her [[sister ship]]s mainly in her main armament. She had six {{convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Model 1886 35-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns mounted in twin [[barbette]] mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30<U+00B0> across the bow and 35<U+00B0> abaft the beam, or a total of 155<U+00B0>. The rear mount could traverse 202<U+00B0>. They had a range of elevation from <U+2212>2<U+00B0> to +15<U+00B0>. ''Chesma''{{'}}s guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to [[list (watercraft)|list]] when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns as far as they could go to one side produced a list of 7.6<U+00B0> and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position.<ref name=m67>McLaughlin, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref> This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate. Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern.<ref name=m67/> They fired a 'light' shell that weighed {{convert|731.3|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or a 'heavy' shell that weighed {{convert|1003|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The 'light' shell had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2090|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} while the 'heavy' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The 'light' shell had a maximum range of {{convert|11600|yd|m}} when fired at an elevation of 15<U+00B0>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_12-35_m1886.htm|title=Russian 12"/35 (30.5 cm) Pattern 1886|date=11 September 2006|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref>

The seven {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[6 inch 35-calibre naval gun 1877|Obukhov Model 1877]] 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} five-barreled revolving [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were mounted in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against [[torpedo boat]]s. Four {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]]. She carried seven above-water {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes were mounted on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 26<U+2013>28</ref>

==History==
[[File:Chesma-IsklyuchonnoeSudnoNo4-1912-3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chesma serving as a target ship]]
''Chesma'' was named after the Russian victory at the [[Battle of Chesma]] in 1770. She was built by the [[Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company|Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT)]] at [[Sevastopol]]. She was laid down in late June 1883, launched on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 21, 30</ref> She served with the [[Black Sea Fleet]] until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, probably for mechanical problems. ''Chesma'' conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical [[observation balloon]]s and she was re-boilered the following year.<ref name=m0>McLaughlin, p. 30</ref> Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used [[Krupp armor]]. This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled, but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered. Her turrets were used to equip the pre-dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Ioann Zlatoust||2}}, then under construction.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 150, 157</ref> 

When the crew of the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Potemkin||2}} mutinied in June 1905, ''Chesma''{{'}}s crew was considered unreliable, and she did not participate in the pursuit of ''Potemkin''. She escorted ''Potemkin'' as {{ship|Russian battleship|Sinop||2}} towed her back to [[Sevastopol]] from [[Constanta]], [[Romania]], where ''Potemkin'' had sought asylum.<ref name=m0/>

The ship was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907.<ref name=m0/> Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full-scale armour trials. She was re-designated as ''Stricken Vessel Nr. 4'' on 22 April 1912. ''Chesma'' was fitted with a replica of the armour system used in the {{sclass|Gangut|battleship}}s to test its effectiveness.<ref name=m0/> She was towed into position and given a 7<U+00B0> list to simulate the descent angle of shells fired at long range. Ironically her own guns were used against her as ''Ioann Zlatoust'' anchored {{convert|750|m|sp=us}} away and fired 12-inch, {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} and 6-inch shells with reduced charges to simulate shells fired from approximately {{convert|16000|-|18000|yd}} away. These revealed significant weaknesses in the support structure for the armour plates and in the deck protection, but the ''Gangut''-class ships were too far along in construction to incorporate fixes.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 247<U+2013>48</ref> Afterwards she served as a torpedo target for the [[destroyer]]s of the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. During these attacks she settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid-1920s.<ref name=m0>McLaughlin, p. 30</ref>
