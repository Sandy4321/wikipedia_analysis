<onlyinclude> <!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below -->
The '''List of Florida birds''' lists every wild [[bird]] [[species]] ever seen in [[Florida]], as accepted by the [[Florida Ornithological Society]] [[Records Committee (Birding)|Records Committee]]. The following markings have been used:

* '''(I)''' - Introduced: Birds that have been introduced to Florida by the actions of man, either directly or indirectly.
* '''(i)''' - Introduced/native: Birds that naturally occur in Florida at certain seasons, or only in parts of the state, but also have populations in Florida that have been introduced by the actions of man, either directly or indirectly.
*'''(E)''' - [[Extinct]].
*'''(e)''' - Extirpated: A bird that, while it is not extinct, is no longer found in Florida.
*'''(A)''' - Accidental: Birds for which the FOSRC requests a full report for verification.</onlyinclude>

Birds listed as accidental should not be expected to be found anywhere in Florida with regularity.  Only birds that are considered to have arrived in Florida without human assistance; or introduced species with established, self-sustaining populations in Florida are included on this list.  This means that birds that are probable escapees are not included on this list.  The [[Barbary Dove|Ringed Turtle-Dove]] (''Streptopelia risoria'') was previously considered to be an established exotic, and, although occasional sightings are reported from residential areas, these birds are probable escapees, and evidence of a true self-sustaining population is lacking. It is, therefore, not included on this list.  There are 497 species on the Florida state checklist.

This list includes the [[Black-hooded Parakeet]], a species which is not on the [[List of North American birds]]. This species has been accepted as an introduced exotic by the FOSRC, however the [[American Birding Association]] has not yet ruled to add the species to the "official" North American list.

This list is presented in taxonomic order and follows ''The Check-list of North American Birds'' (7th ed., 46th supplement, 2005), published by the [[American Ornithologists' Union]]. The table of contents is grouped into [[passerine]]s (the largest [[order (biology)|order]] of birds) and non-passerines. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family accounts. Introduced, casual, accidental, extirpated and extinct species are included in the total species counts for North America and Florida.

The Bananaquit is a small passerine bird. It has a slender, curved bill, adapted to taking nectar from flowers and is the only member of the genus Coereba (Vieillot, 1809) and is normally placed within the family Coerebidae, although there is uncertainty whether that placement is correct (hence the assignment Genus: ''Coereba'' ''[[Incertae sedis]]'').

Many emberizid species have distinctive head patterns. There are species 275 world wide, 60 North American species and 33 Florida species.
