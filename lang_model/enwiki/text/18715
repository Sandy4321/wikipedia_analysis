To tell a story that mixes feelings of the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world]], the artistic and general director Marcos Schechtman and the director Fred Mayrink were to India to write the first scenes of '''''[[Caminho das <U+00CD>ndias]]'''''. Exactly on [[October 1]], [[2008]], different moments of history began to be recorded in two Indian cities: [[Jaipur]], known for its pink walls, and [[Agra]], famous for [[Taj Mahal]]. The chapters will bring the first meetings of the protagonists ''Maya'' ([[Juliana Paes]]) and ''Bahuan'' ([[M<U+00E1>rcio Garcia]]), the routine of ''Raj'' ([[Rodrigo Lombardi]]), the clashes between ''Opash'' ([[Tony Ramos]]) and ''Shankar'' ([[Lima Duarte]]) and the adaptation of Brazilian Camila ([[<U+00CD>sis Valverde]]) to a so different culture from her.

In addition to 40 people from the Brazilian team, the telenovela had the partnership of a local producer. Palaces, temples, festivals and a curious transit with cars, bikes, elephants and camels, draw the attention of the Brazilians. "''I feel the most privileged person in the world to be here. It is incredible diving in a so rich culture''", said the actress Juliana Paes. The cast was completely thrilled with the experience: Rodrigo Lombardi always tried to learn a new phrase in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] - the most spoken language in the place -; M<U+00E1>rcio Garcia not left his camera; <U+00CD>sis Valverde talked with the Indian consultants of the telenovela, and [[Betty Gofman]] delighted with the animals.

Most of the actors returned to [[Brazil]] on [[October 12]], after recording in the city of Jaipur, but Juliana Paes, M<U+00E1>rcio Garcia and Rodrigo Lombardi followed to Agra, where they were directed by Fred Mayrink. Without cast, Marcos Schechtman traveled with their lenses even the cities of [[Varanasi]], where is located the [[Ganges river]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Jodhpur]]. At the end of October, was also carried out a new journey and Marcos Schechtman captured images of a city designed for the future: [[Dubai]], in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. In history, the Indian driver ''Gopal'' ([[Andr<U+00E9> Gon<U+00E7>alves]]) shows the modern architecture and construction of the largest cranes in the world to ''Raul'' ([[Alexandre Borges]]) and ''Yvone'' ([[Leticia Sabatella]]), who visit the site as tourists.

== Setting ==

To recreate the environment where it becomes the story of ''Caminho das <U+00CD>ndias'', were constructed three scenographic cities at the [[Rede Globo#Centers|Globo Studios Complex]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. One represents the [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]] and brings the features of the Rio's neighbourhood. Already the other two reflect a bit of routine through Indian environments and specific elements of the country. In the plot, the writter [[Gl<U+00F3>ria Perez]] portrays different customs of [[India]] and use a poetic license to the state of [[Rajasthan]] where a redoubt peculiarities are concentrated in other regions of the country. It was with this orientation that Mario designed the largest scenographic city of ''Caminho das <U+00CD>ndias'', with an area of 6.000m<sup>2</sup>, where becomes the central story. 

Using the cities of [[Jaipur]], [[Jodhpur]] and [[Mumbai]] as references, the director of art built 42 shops and a temple in honor of the Hindu god [[Shiva]], with their interiors, in addition to the facades and entries of a cinema and homes of the four main Indian families of the story: that of Ananda, the Meeth, to ''Shankar'' and ''Pandit'' (Jos<U+00E9> de Abreu), which will be supplemented in the studio. These homes are located in the center, which received the terracotta color and is different from most poor, marked by a range of shades of blue. The other Indian scenographic city is smaller, but no less bold. In an area of 2.500m<sup>2</sup> were reproduced the [[Ganges river]] and one of its steps. The idea is to change the background image, using the back lot, a sort of "[[chroma key]]" with more depth, to get the feeling that the scenes take place in different places and times of the day. The challenge was great, but Mario is enthusiastic about the process and outcome of the work. An artificial lake was built at the beginning of the Globo Studios Complex and trails to put the cameras to film inside the water.

Reproductions of India certainly have more work to the art director, but the core of the Brazilian scenarios were also constructed with a wealth of details. The Lapa is represented in an area of 3.000m<sup>2</sup>, consisting of a store, some shops, two botequins and pastries from ''Dona Ashima'' ([[Mara Manzan]]), with only two indoor environments without. The Ashima's botequin, who will become a meeting point of the characters, also has oriental elements inside, which contrasted with the typical architecture of the neighborhood on his outside Rio de Janeiro. Other scenes of great relevance to the plot are the houses of ''Raul'' and ''Ramiro'' ([[Humberto Martins]]) and the clinic of ''Dr. Castanho'' ([[St<U+00EA>nio Garcia]]), mounted on external hiring. The hospital that centralizes the primary campaign's social novel received antiquated air, with bars on all windows, to highlight the lack of investment in the Brazilian institutions.

== Visual ==
The team of art production reproduced a true [[Culture of India|Indian universe]] before the cameras. Besides producing typical transport of that country, were assembled in different environments the cores of the weft and manufacture all the telenovela's graphic material. The art producer traveled to the recordings of ''Caminho das <U+00CD>ndias'' and to purchase specific objects of the country, but before taking the plane, had read books, sought information on the internet and talked a lot with the artistic director and general Marcos Schechtman and the writter Gl<U+00F3>ria Perez.

Despite the concern in getting more prepared, Ana not to be surprised when left foot in the state of Rajasthan. To represent the atmosphere, she and her team reproduced 12 "riquix<U+00E1>s", sort of charrete pulled by a man on a bicycle, and eight took tooks, three-wheeled motor vehicle, which circulate through the scenographic city, built in the Globo Studios Complex, in Rio de Janeiro. The Indian core of the telenovela received a very colorful ambiance, which is opposed to the clean aesthetic of the Brazilian scenarios.

The work is always done in partnership with the art director and set designer Mario Monteiro, and the 42 stores that he built at the place also received special treatment. The signs and labels for products sold in the establishments are all written in [[Hindi]], the most spoken language in India, and made by the Ana's team, which also produces the graphic material of the telemarketing center where ''Maya'' works, the Cadore Company and the hospital of Dr. Castanho.

== Costumes ==

To create the look of the Indian characters of the telenovela, the figurinist Em<U+00ED>lia Duncan studied all the codes of the Hindus clothing in order to adapt them to history. In India, women wear clothes like typical [[Sari]] - a wound tissue in the body - and [[Punjab]] - set of pants and long coat - and the men dress is commonly as the Western world, but with parts that refer to the [[1970s]]. Em<U+00ED>lia works with poetic license, bringing the traditional clothing, usually used in rituals, for the day-to-day and emphasizing the Indian culture minutely described in the text. There are many details in the Indian women's clothing, but the biggest challenge, according to the costumes, was mounting the wardrobe of men.

For the character ''Raj'', who lived in the [[United Kingdom]], Em<U+00ED>lia aside some influences from the European country, such as scarves and neck in Jodhpur pants, which appeared in the city same name and is currently used by the Polo team in India. Already ''Bahuan'' is less traditional and has more loose clothing, with American touches.

The tones are more sober, but as the black is a sign of bad omen in India, Em<U+00ED>lia left the Brazilian color to the core. The great contrast between the costumes of the two countries is given by ''Dayse'' ([[Betty Gofman]]), a Rio impressed with the Eastern culture that mixes colors and styles, not stick to the meaning of each piece to the caste system. The pattern of the other cores are the Brazilians that are commonly found in the street. Only in the clinic of Dr. Castanho we chose to wear the smock with doctors, a kind of jaleco, to distinguish them from the patients.
