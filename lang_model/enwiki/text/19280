===Early life and education===
Ben Daniels was born on [[10 June]] [[1964]]<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last=Shimmon|first=Katie|title=College days [Ben Daniels]|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5194596-108283,00.html|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' (''EducationGuardian'')|date=[[2005-05-17]]}}</ref> in [[Nuneaton]] in [[Warwickshire, England|Warwickshire]], [[England]].<ref name="IMDb">{{imdb name|0199842|Ben Daniels}}. Retrieved on [[28 December]] [[2007]].</ref> His father was an engineer at [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and later a grocer, while his mother owned a children's clothes shop. He has an older and a younger sister. Daniels has recalled: "I was quite a shy child, but quite disruptive as well. I was very sneaky and underhand."<ref name="ES">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Nick|title=Cutting it on stage|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-11498329-details/Cutting+it+on+stage/article.do|publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk, ''[[Evening Standard]]''|date=[[2004-06-17]]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}
</ref>

According to Daniels, drama lessons at [[Ordinary Level|O-levels]] gave him a voice, and when he attended [[sixth form]] studies at Stratford College in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] between 1980 and 1982, doing [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] in theatre studies and English literature, he attended [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] performances avidly.<ref name="ES"/> A fellow student recalled that Daniels, whom he knew as Dave, "was very serious about his work, and struck me as incredibly intelligent. ... You got the sense his mind was working; the cogs were ticking over".<ref name="Guardian"/> Daniels subsequently trained at the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA) for three years.<ref name="IMDb"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Ben Daniels &ndash; Augustin|url=http://www.finelinefeatures.com/passion/castbios.html|publisher=[[Fine Line Features]]|year=2005|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

[[Image:Ben daniels cuttingit.jpg|thumb|left|Daniels as Finn Bevan in ''[[Cutting It]]'' (2002&ndash;2005).]]

===Professional career===
One of Daniels' earliest roles was appearing as [[Justin Hayward]], the lead singer of [[The Moody Blues]], as a teenager in two of the band's [[music video]]s, ''[[The Other Side of Life|Your Wildest Dreams]]'' (1986) and ''[[Sur La Mer|I Know You're Out There Somewhere]]'' (1988). Since then, he has taken on parts in many UK television dramas, such as Robin in ''[[The Lost Language of Cranes]]'' (1991), based on [[David Leavitt]]'s 1986 book; the Biblical character [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]] in the 1997 [[Emmy]]-nominated TV film ''David''; the philandering Finn Bevan in ''[[Cutting It]]'' (2002&ndash;2005); and Nicholas Brocklehurst, the British Counsellor for External Affairs at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., in the [[BBC]] television mini-series ''[[The State Within]]'' (2006) &ndash; the latter role was notable for an unexpected same-sex kiss between Daniels' character and another person.<ref>{{cite web|last=Urban|first=Robert|title=Ben Daniels is our kind of gay actor|url=http://www.afterelton.com/archive/elton/people/2007/2/bendaniels.html|publisher=AfterElton.com|date=[[2007-02-15]]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> In 2008 he appeared in ''[[Lark Rise to Candleford]]'', a BBC production based on three semi-autobiographical novels about the English countryside written by [[Flora Thompson]].

Daniel has also played a number of real-life characters: German State Secretary Dr. [[Josef B<U+00FC>hler]] in ''[[Conspiracy (film)|Conspiracy]]'', 2001 a dramatization of the [[Wannsee Conference]] at which the [[Final Solution]] was endorsed; the English author and journalist [[Ian Fleming]], creator of [[James Bond]], in ''Ian Fleming: Bondmaker'' (2005); Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]'s spymaster, in ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV show)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (2005); and English writer [[Saki]] in ''Who Killed Mrs De Ropp?''

Daniels may be most recognizable to American audiences for appearing in the 1996 gay film ''[[Beautiful Thing]]'', written by [[Jonathan Harvey]] and based on his play of the same name. Daniels portrayed Tony, boyfriend of Sandra, the protagonist Jamie's mother. In an independent film directed by Lavinia Currier titled ''[[Passion in the Desert]]'' (1997), based on a [[short story]] by novelist [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]], Daniels, in one of the few films where he has the lead role, acted as a French soldier named Augustin Robert. His character becomes lost in the desert during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s invasion of Egypt and develops a strange bond with a leopard he meets.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0125980|title=Passion in the Desert}}. Retrieved on [[28 December]] [[2007]].</ref> ''Passion in the Desert'', which was nominated for a [[Golden Seashell]] award, also featured renowned French actor [[Michel Piccoli]] and was filmed in Jordan and in Utah, USA. Other feature films that Daniels has starred in are ''[[The Bridge (1992 film)|The Bridge]]'' (1992), [[Michael Winterbottom]]<U+2019>s ''[[I Want You (1998 film)|I Want You]]'' (1998); ''[[Madeline (1998 film)|Madeline]]'' (1998), in which he was cast as the somewhat sinister British tutor Leopold; and ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (2005), loosely based on the [[Doom (video game)|computer game]] of the same name. He was offered roles in the 2000 releases ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' with [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning actor/director [[Mel Gibson]], and in ''[[Vertical Limit]]'', but turned them down, stating: "The money was good, but it wasn't for me".<ref name="TVNZ">{{cite web|title=Interview with Ben Daniels|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410965/446930|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ)|year=[?2003]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

In the theatre, Daniels is in his element.

==Personal life==
Daniels is openly [[gay]] &ndash; he has remarked "Out? I've never been in"<ref name="ES"/> &ndash; and lives with stage actor Ian Gelder.<ref>A 2004 article about Daniels states that Ian Gelder was aged 55 years and that they had been partners for more than a decade: {{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Nick|title=Cutting it on stage|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-11498329-details/Cutting+it+on+stage/article.do|publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk, ''[[Evening Standard]]''|date=[[2004-06-17]]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> They began seeing each other during a production of [[Joe Orton]]'s ''[[Entertaining Mr Sloane]]''. Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, although he did not discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was "cautious about mentioning it when I left drama school, because [[AIDS|Aids]] was terrifying everyone and there was a huge, [[Homophobia|homophobic]] backlash." He decided to be open about being gay at the age of 24 years, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of [[Martin Sherman]]'s ''[[Bent]]''. Daniels has said:

{{quote|Homophobia is still shockingly prevalent in film and TV. I know I've lost work because of being gay, and it is always an issue. Even on a serious [[BBC Two|BBC2]] drama there will be some suit in some office going, "Hmmm, isn't he a poof?" I don't consider myself politically gay, but whenever I catch a whiff of that now, I'm on it like a ton of bricks.<ref name="ES"/>}}

In 2007, Daniels was ranked number 79 in the annual Pink List of 100 influential gay and lesbian people in Britain published by ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=The pink list 2007: The ''IoS'' annual celebration of the great and the gay|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2516664.ece|publisher=''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]''|date=[[2007-05-06]]}}</ref> down from number 47 in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shoffman|first=Marc|title=Ian McKellen ranked most influential gay man|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1863.html|publisher=''[[Pink News]]''|date=[[2006-07-03]]|accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

In his spare time, he is an amateur painter and [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga|Ashtanga yoga]] devotee.<ref name="TVNZ"/>
