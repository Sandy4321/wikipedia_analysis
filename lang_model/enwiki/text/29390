The '''Michigan Life Sciences Corridor''' (MLSC) is a [[United States dollar|$]]1 billion [[biotechnology]] initiative in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It started in [[1999]] with money from the state's settlement with the [[tobacco industry]]. The MLSC invests in biotech research at four Michigan institutions: the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], and the [[Van Andel Institute]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. The Michigan [[Economic Development Corporation]] administers the program.

==History==
In 1998, the State of Michigan, along with 45 other states, reached an [[United States dollar|$]]8.5 billion [[settlement (law)|settlement]] with the U.S. tobacco industry.<ref>O'Connor, Julie. "[http://www.research.wayne.edu/NewScience02/MLSC.pdf Wayne State major participant in Michigan Life Sciences Corridor research]".</ref> Former Governor [[John Engler]] created the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor in 1999 when he signed Public Act 120 of 1999.<ref>[http://www.msu.edu/~lsc/LifeSciences.pdf Michigan Public Act 120 of 1999].
</ref> The bill appropriated money from the state's settlement with the tobacco industry to fund biotech research at four of Michigan's largest research institutions.<ref>Truscott, John. "[http://www.state.mi.us/migov/gov/PressReleases/199907/LifeSciencesCorridorPR.htm Governor Signs Bill Creating "Life Sciences Corridor" in Michigan]". Michigan Executive Office press release. July 19, 1999.</ref> Under the management of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the MLSC allocated $1 billion over the course of 20 years, including $50 million in 1999 to fund research on [[aging]].<ref>[http://www.msu.edu/~lsc/history.htm MLSC Background and History].
</ref> The following year, the MLSC awarded $100 million to 63 Michigan universities.<ref>McMahon, Kathleen. "[http://medc.michigan.org/news/major/combo.asp?ContentId=DE45348C-DC00-4E00-B799-F7DEFFF391EA&QueueId=1&ContentTypeId=7 First Round of Life Sciences Corridor Funds Awarded]". Michigan Economic Development Corporation press release. December 14, 2000.</ref> In 2002, current Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] incorporated the MLSC into the Michigan Technology Tri-Corridor, adding funding for [[homeland security]] and [[alternative fuel]] research.<ref>Kurz, Matt. "[http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2003/0310/0304-x061.html Bailey named to Technology Tri-Corridor Committee]." October 21, 2003.</ref> With 14 years left in the program, the leaders of Michigan hope that such investments in [[high tech]] research will expand the State's economic base.
