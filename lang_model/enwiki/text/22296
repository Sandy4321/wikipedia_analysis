The '''[[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]] F-101 Voodoo''' was a supersonic military [[fighter]] flown by the [[USAF]] and the [[RCAF]]. Initially designed as a long-range bomber escort (known as a ''penetration fighter'') for the [[Strategic Air Command]], the Voodoo served in a variety of other roles, including the [[fighter bomber]], all-weather [[interceptor aircraft]] and [[reconnaissance|photo reconnaissance]] roles. Reconnaissance Voodoos saw extensive service during the [[Vietnam War]].

==Design and development==
Initial design on what would eventually become the Voodoo began just after [[World War II]] in response to a USAAF Penetration Fighter Competition in 1946 for a long-range high performance fighter to escort bombers, much as the [[P-51 Mustang]] had done in its time. After being awarded a contract (AC-14582), [[McDonnell]] built two prototypes, designated the [[XF-88 Voodoo|XF-88]]. The first prototype (#46-6525), powered by two Westinghouse XJ-34-WE-13 (3000 hp/2240 kW) flew from [[Edwards AFB, California|Muroc]] on [[20 October]] [[1948 in aviation|1948]]. Preliminary testing revealed that the top speed was a disappointing 640 mph (1,030 km/h) at sea level. After fitting McDonnell-designed afterburners, thrust was increased by 30% with corresponding performance increases in top speed, initial rate of climb and reduced takeoff distance.

Although the XF-88 won the "fly-off" competition against the competing [[Lockheed XF-90]] and [[North American XF-93]], the USAF (created in 1947) reevaluated the need for bomber escort and terminated the Penetration Fighter program in 1950. Analysis of [[Korean War|Korean war]] missions, however, revealed that current USAF strategic bombers were vulnerable to fighter interception. In 1951, the USAF issued a new requirement for a bomber escort with all major US manufacturers submitting designs. The McDonnell design was a larger and higher powered version of the XF-88, and won the bid in May 1951. The '''F-88''' was redesignated the '''F-101 Voodoo''' in November 1951.

Design work was relatively simple, as the only major change from the initial specification was to change the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] [[turbojets]] to a much more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney]] design. The new engines required certain changes to the intakes and a lengthened fuselage to triple the fuel load. The design was approved, and an order for 39 F-101As was placed in May 1953 without any prototypes built. Performance was considerably greater than the barely supersonic [[F-100 Super Sabre]], but would fall short of later Mach 2 class fighters. However the Mach 1.7 performance is very comparable to the current [[McDonnell Douglas]], now [[Boeing]] [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] which trades off maximum speed for turning performance.

The first flight of the F-101A was on [[21 September ]] [[1954 in aviation|1954]]. The end of the war in Korea and the development of the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] negated the need for fighter escort and [[Strategic Air Command]] withdrew from the program. The aircraft would be employed primarily as a two-seat air defence interceptor, nuclear fighter bomber and a reconnaissance platform which saw service over Cuba and Vietnam.

The Voodoo's replacement as a bomber would be the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II]]. While the Voodoo was a moderate success, it may have been more important as an evolutionary step towards  the Phantom, the most versatile and successful western fighter design of the 1960s if not all time. The Phantom would retain the twin engines, twin crew for interception duties, and a tail mounted well above and behind the jet exhaust.

==Operational history==
===F-101A / RF-101G===
[[image:F-101A Voodoo.png|thumb|F-101A Voodoo]]
Despite SAC's loss of interest, the aircraft attracted the attention of [[Tactical Air Command]], and the F-101 was reconfigured as a [[fighter bomber]], intended to carry a single [[nuclear weapon]] for use against battlefield targets such as airfields. With the support of TAC, testing was resumed, with [[Category II flight test]]s beginning in early 1955. A number of problems were identified during development. Many of these were fixed although the aircraft had a dangerous tendency toward severe [[pitch-up]] at high [[angle of attack]] that was never entirely solved. Around 2,300 improvements were made to the aircraft in 1955-56 before full production was resumed in November 1956. 

The first F-101A was delivered in May [[1957 in aviation|1957]] to the [[27th Strategic Fighter Wing]], replacing their [[F-84 Thunderstreak|F-84F Thunderstreak]]. The F-101A had two [[Pratt & Whitney J57|P&W J57-P-13]] [[turbojet]]s, each with 10,200 lbf (45.4 kN) dry and 15,000 lbf (66.7 kN) afterburning thrust. It had MA-7 fire-control radar for both air-to-air and air-to-ground use, augmented by an MA-2 [[toss-bombing]] system for delivering nuclear weapons. It was fitted with four [[M39 cannon]], and designed to carry a [[B28 bomb|Mk 28]] [[nuclear bomb]] (although it was theoretically capable of carrying conventional bombs or rockets, the Voodoo never used such weapons operationally). In service, one cannon was often removed to make room for a [[TACAN]] beacon receiver.

F-101 was the first aircraft in USAF inventory capable of exceeding 1000 mph in level flight. There were a number of speed records set by the Voodoo: a '''JF-101A''' set a world speed record of 1,942 km/h (1,207 mph) on [[December 12]], [[1957]], handily beating the previous [[Fairey Delta 2]] record, an '''RF-101A''' flew [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-[[New York]]-Los Angeles route in 6 hours, 46 minutes, and an '''F-101A''' flew from [[Carswell Air Force Base|Carswell, Texas]] to [[Bermuda]] without refueling.

A total of 77 F-101As were built. They were gradually withdrawn from service starting in 1966. Twenty-nine survivors were converted to '''RF-101G''' specifications with [[reconnaissance]] cameras in place of cannons and radar. These served with the [[Air National Guard]] through 1972.

===RF-101A===
In October 1953, the USAF requested that two F-101As be built as prototype '''YRF-101A''' tactical [[reconnaissance]] aircraft. These were followed by 35 '''RF-101A''' production aircraft. The RF-101A shared the airframe of the F-101A including its 6.33 [[g-force|''g'']] (62 m/s<U+00B2>) limit but replaced the radar and cannons with up to six cameras in the reshaped nose. It was unusual in having provision for both flying boom and probe-and-drogue [[in-flight refueling]]. RF-101A entered service in May 1957, replacing the [[B-57 Canberra|RB-57 Canberra]]. 

[[USAF]] RF-101As flew reconnaissance sorties over [[Cuba]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. 

In October 1959 eight RF-101As were transferred to [[Taiwan]], which used them for overflights of the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] mainland. Two were reportedly shot down.

===F-101B / CF-101B / EF-101B===
[[Image:Cf101 borden 1.jpg|right|thumb|CF-101 Voodoo displayed on the grounds of CFB Borden (Base Borden Military Museum).]] 
In the late [[1940s]], the Air Force had started a research project into future [[interceptor aircraft]] that eventually settled on an advanced specification known as the [[1954 Interceptor Project|1954 Interceptor]]. Contracts for this specification eventually resulted in the selection of the [[F-102]], but by 1952 it was becoming clear that none of the parts of the specification other than the airframe would be ready by 1954: the engines, weapons and fire control systems were all going to take too long to get into service. An effort was then started to quickly produce an interim supersonic design to replace the various subsonic interceptors then in service, and the F-101 airframe was selected as a starting point.

Although McDonnell proposed the designation '''F-109''' for the new aircraft (which was to be a substantial departure from the basic Voodoo), the USAF assigned the designation '''F-101B'''. The Voodoo was modified to carry a crew of two, with a larger and more rounded forward fuselage to hold a [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]] MA-13 fire control [[radar]]. It had transponders linking it to the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE)]] system, allowing it to be steered onto targets by ground controllers. The F-101B had uprated [[Pratt & Whitney J57|P & W J57-P-55]] engines each with 11,990 lbf (53.34 kN) dry and 16,900 lbf (75.2 kN) afterburning thrust, making it the only Voodoo not using the -13 engines. The new engines were substantially longer than J57-P-13s and to avoid a major redesign the afterburners were simply allowed to extend out of the fuselage by almost 8 ft (2.4 m). 

The F-101B had no cannons, instead, it carried four [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon]] [[air-to-air missile]]s on a rotating door in the fuselage weapons bay. Initial load was two GAR-1 (AIM-4A) [[semi-active radar homing]] and two GAR-2 (AIM-4D) [[infrared-guided]] weapons. After the first two missiles were fired, the door turned over to expose the second pair. Standard practice was to fire the weapons in SARH/IR pairs to increase the likelihood of a hit. Late-production models had provision for two MB-1/[[AIR-2]] Genie [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[rocket]]s in place of two of the Falcons, and '''Project "Kitty Car"''' upgraded most earlier F-101Bs to this standard beginning in 1961.

[[Image:F101MissleBay.jpg|right|thumb|The AIM-4 Falcon side of the F-101B missile door]]

From [[1961]] through 1966, F-101Bs were upgraded under '''Project 'Bright Horizon,'''' fitting them with a retractable [[FLIR|infrared sighting and tracking (IRST)]] system in the nose in place of the standard [[in-flight refueling]] probe. 

The F-101B was made in greater numbers than the F-101A with a total of 479 being delivered by the end of production in 1961. Most of these were delivered to [[Air Defense Command]] beginning in January 1959. The only foreign customer for the F-101B was [[Canada]]. For more details on the history of the Voodoo in Canada, see [[CF-101 Voodoo]].

The F-101B was withdrawn from ADC service from 1969 to 1972. Surviving USAF aircraft were transferred to the [[Air National Guard]], where they served until 1982.

===TF-101B / F-101F / CF-101F===
Some of the F-101Bs were completed as dual-control operational [[trainer]] aircraft initially dubbed '''TF-101B''' but later redesignated '''F-101F'''. Seventy-nine new-build F-101Fs were manufactured, and 152 more existing aircraft were later modified with dual controls. Ten of these were supplied to Canada under the designation '''CF-101F'''.  These were later replaced with 10 updated aircraft in 1971.

===RF-101B===
In the early [[1970s]], a batch of 22 ex-RCAF CF-101Bs were returned to the [[USAF]] and converted to '''RF-101B''' [[reconnaissance]] aircraft with radar and weapons bay replaced with a package of three KS-87B cameras and two AXQ-2 TV cameras. An [[in-flight refueling]] boom receptacle was fitted. These aircraft served with the [[192nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron]] of the ANG through 1975. They were expensive to operate and maintain and had a short service life.

===F-101C / RF-101H===
The F-101A fighter-bomber had been accepted into [[Tactical Air Command]] service despite a number of problems. Among others, its airframe had proven to be capable of withstanding only 6.33 [[g-force|''g'']] (62 m/s<U+00B2>) maneuvers rather than the intended 7.33 ''g'' (72 m/s<U+00B2>). An improved model, the '''F-101C''', was introduced in [[1957 in aviation|1957]]. It had a 500 lb (227 kg) heavier structure to allow 7.33 ''g'' maneuvers as well as a revised fuel system to increase the maximum flight time in [[afterburner (engine)|afterburner]]. There were no external differences between F-101A and F-101C other than the serial numbers. Forty-seven were produced.

The F-101C was stationed in the [[United Kingdom]] to be within closer striking range of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] forces. Originally serving with the [[27th Tactical Fighter Wing]], the aircraft were transferred to the [[81st Tactical Fighter Wing]] which operated three squadrons from [[RAF air station Bentwaters/Woodbridge]]. Both F-101A/C aircraft were assigned to the 81st.  Operational F-101A/C were upgraded in service with Low Angle Drogued Delivery (LADD) and Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) equipment for its primary mission of delivering nuclear weapons at extremely low altitudes. Pilots were trained for one-way missions into Soviet territory to increase effective range at some cost in negating pilot recovery.

The F-101C never saw combat and was replaced in [[1966 in aviation|1966]] with the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4C Phantom II]].  32 aircraft were later converted for unarmed [[reconnaissance]] use under the '''RF-101H''' designation. They served with [[Air National Guard]] units until 1972.

===RF-101C===
[[Image:020903-o-9999r-018.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Air Force technicians prepare a McDonald RF-101 Voodoo for a photo reconnaissance mission.]] 
Using the reinforced airframe of the F-101C, the '''RF-101C''' first flew on [[12 July]], [[1957]], entering service in [[1958 in aviation|1958]]. Like RF-101A, RF-101C had six cameras in place of radar and cannons in the reshaped nose. Unlike the RF-101A, the RF-101C retained the ability to carry a single [[nuclear weapon]] on the centerline pylon. 166 were built, including 96 originally scheduled to be F-101C fighter-bombers. 

The 1964 '''Project "Toy Tiger"''' fitted some RF-101C with a new camera package and a centerline pod for photo-flash cartridges. Some were further upgraded under the '''Mod 1181''' program with automatic control for the cameras.

The RF-101C saw service during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and was sent to [[Vietnam]] in 1961, becoming the first [[USAF]] jet aircraft to serve there. RF-101C saw heavy service during the [[Vietnam War]], losing the first F-101 in November 1964 to ground fire. From 1965 through November 1970, it's role was gradually replaced by the [[F-4 Phantom II|RF-4C Phantom II]]. In some 35,000 sorties, 44 aircraft were lost -- 31 to anti-aircraft fire, five to [[surface-to-air missile|SAMs]], one to an airfield attack, six to operational accidents, and one in air combat to a Mig-21 in September 1967. The RF-101C's speed made it largely immune to MiG interception. In April 1967, ALQ-71 [[ECM]] pods were fitted to provide some protection against SAMs. Although the Voodoo was again able to operate at medium altitudes, the added drag decreased the speed enough to make RF-101 vulnerable to MiGs and thus requiring fighter escort.

After withdrawal from Vietnam, the RF-101C continued to serve with USAF units through 1979.

In service, the RF-101C was nicknamed "'''Long Bird''';" it was the only Voodoo to see combat.
