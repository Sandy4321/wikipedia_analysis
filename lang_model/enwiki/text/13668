'''James Edward English''' (March 13, 1812 &ndash; March 2, 1890) was a [[United States Representative]] and [[United States Senator|Senator]] from [[Connecticut]].

==Biography==
English was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and attended the common schools. An apprentice carpenter at the age of 16, he became a successful businessman, establishing the English and Welch Lumber Company, and restructuring the New Haven Clock Company into one of the largest clock manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=James E. English|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_connecticut/col2-content/main-content-list/title_english_james.html|publisher=National Governors Association|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> He was twice married; to Caroline A. Fowler and to Anna Robinson Morris. He had four children; Edward Fowler English (1838 - 1841), Augusta Caroline English (1843 - 1857), Edward Fowler English (1848 - 1849), and Henry Fowler English (1851 - 1947).<ref>{{cite web|title=James E. English|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6845757|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
English engaged in the [[lumber]] business, banking, and manufacturing. He was a member of the New Haven board of [[selectmen]] from 1847 to 1861, and a member of the common council in 1848 and 1849. He was a member of the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]] in 1855 and of the [[Connecticut Senate]] from 1856 to 1858, and was an unsuccessful candidate for [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|lieutenant governor]] in 1860.

English was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1861 to March 4, 1865.<ref>{{cite web|title=James E. English|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/james_english/403874|publisher=Govtrack US Congress|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>  He was not a candidate for renomination in 1864. 

Left his ill wife to vote at The Capitol in favor of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] abolishing slavery in 1864. His "aye" prompted applause "and the tide turned." Sadly, in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2012 epic [[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]] movie, both English and [[Augustus Brandegee]], his abolitionist Republican colleague from Connecticut, are given two fictional names and are ''both'' shown, erroneously, to have voted ''against'' the amendment.<ref name=Dowd>{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|title=The Oscar for Best Fabrication|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/dowd-the-oscar-for-best-fabrication.html?_r=0|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 February 2013}}</ref> 

Unsuccessful in his 1866 gubernatorial bid, English was elected Connecticut's 26th governor on April 1, 1867,<ref>{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=David|title=Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans 1862-1872|year=1967|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|page=296}}</ref> serving from May 1, 1867 to May 5, 1869. He lost his reelection in 1869, but was successfully reelected in 1870 and served from May 4, 1870 to May 16, 1871. During his tenure, an argument between the railroad and shipping industries was settled with the approval for construction of two new bridges. English ran again for reelection in 1871, and won the popular vote, but a canvassing committee found the election was fraudulent with stolen votes and erroneous totals, and awarded the governorship to Marshall Jewell.

English was elected again in 1872 to serve in the Connecticut House of Representatives. He was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Orris S. Ferry]] and served from November 27, 1875, to May 17, 1876, when a successor was elected.<ref>{{cite web|title=James E. English|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=e000185|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> 
 
An unsuccessful candidate for election in 1876 to fill the vacancy, English resumed his manufacturing and commercial activities.

==Death==
English died in New Haven  March 2, 1890 (age 77 years, 354 days), and is interred at Evergreen Cemetery, New Haven, Connecticut.<ref>{{cite web|title=James E. English|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/english.html#719.60.87|publisher=The Political Graveyard|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>
