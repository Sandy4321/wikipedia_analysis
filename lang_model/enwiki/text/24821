'''Mari<U+00E1>n Varga''' (born January 29, 1947, [[Skalica]], [[Slovakia]]) is a Slovak musician, composer and [[Organ (music)|organ]] player.

==Biography==
He has played piano since the age of six. He studied piano and composition at the conservatory in Bratislava. He left the conservatory after three years to become a member of the group [[Pr<U+00FA>dy]], and contributed to the legendary album ''[[Zvo<U+0148>te zvonky]]''. He left Pr<U+00FA>dy as suddenly as he had left conservatory only to establish the first Czechoslovak [[art rock]] band Collegium Musicum.

The repertoire of Collegium Musicum, comprising mostly instrumental pieces, included reinterpretations of the themes of classics such as [[Joseph Haydn]], [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], complemented by original compositions. Already at this stage his work bore signs of postmodernism (Euf<U+00F3>nia of the album Konvergencie), which later became the basic principle of his work.

When Collegium Musicum disbanded in 1979, Varga started a solo career. Among other achievements, he became a pioneer of absolute improvisation (real-time composition) in Slovakia. In the meantime he continued to contribute to popular music. His ongoing collaboration with [[Pavol Hammel]] led to five successful albums and to the first rock musical in Slovakia.
