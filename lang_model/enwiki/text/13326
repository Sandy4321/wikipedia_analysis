A number of '''Ethiopian sign languages''' have been used in various Ethiopian schools for the deaf since 1971, and at the primary level since 1956. Ethiopian Sign Language, presumably a national standard, is used in primary, secondary, and<U+2014>at [[Addis Ababa University]]<U+2014>tertiary education, and on national television. The Ethiopian Deaf Community uses the language as a marker of identity.

EthSL is an emerging sign language with some regional variations.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Like many of African Sign Languages, it has a historical connection with [[American Sign Language]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} However, it has independent lexical and grammatical structures.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
