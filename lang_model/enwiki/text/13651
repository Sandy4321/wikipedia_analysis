Judge '''Robert Lamberton''' (March 20, 1809 <U+2013> August 7, 1885) was an associate Judge of the Courts of [[Venango County]], [[Pennsylvania]], who founded the first bank in the County later known as the Lamberton Savings Bank. The bank building was demolished in 1969 to make way for the First National Bank of Pennsylvania.<ref>The News-Herald Franklin & Oil City, edition of January 9, 1976</ref><ref>[http://www.familyoldphotos.com/pa/images2/jun/FRANKLIN__LAMBERTON_NAT.BANK_1912.jpg The Lamberton Building Franklin Pa]</ref>

== Early years ==
Robert Lamberton was born and brought up on the family farm near to what is now [[Eglinton, County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. At the age of 21 he emigrated to the United States and stayed with an uncle in [[Plum, Pennsylvania|Plum township]], Venago County, with whom he laboured for some months. He later obtained work as a stone cutter on the [[Erie Canal]] before returning to [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]. From meagre beginnings as a clerk in a dry goods store he opened a small shop in the town which expanded rapidly and eventually became a department store dealing in furnishings and family supplies of every kind. In addition to merchandising, he was also involved in the establishment of a rolling mill and nail factory in the town and later erected mills for the manufacture of flour and lumber.<ref>" Memorial of Robert Lamberton " (Franklin, 1886) printed by J.B.

== Oil rush ==
The development of the oil business brought vast wealth into Venango County and demanded a need for adequate financial institutions. The early pioneers of the oil excitement had to have a safe place to keep their large sums of money so Lamberton opened the first bank in the County and installed an exceptionally large strong safe in his store. In 1860 when he built the Lamberton Homestead, he included a banking room within the premises. The site was subsequently used for the [[YMCA]] building which now too is long gone. He continued to make large investments in real estate in Franklin.<ref>" Memorial of Robert Lamberton " (Franklin, 1886) printed by J.B. Rodgers Printing Company, Philadelphia</ref>

== Public service ==
In 1861, he was elected as an associate Judge of the Courts of Venango County, an office he held with honour for five years. He also served several terms with the [[City Council]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. As a church officer and trustee of Franklin [[Presbyterian Church]] he was heavily involved in all church activities from an early stage.<ref>" Memorial of Robert Lamberton " (Franklin, 1886) printed by J.B.
