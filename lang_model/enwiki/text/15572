"'''Aesthetics of Hate'''" is a song by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Machine Head]] from their sixth studio album ''[[The Blackening]]''. Written by Machine Head vocalist and guitarist [[Robert Flynn]], the song is a retaliation to an article written by William Grim. Grim wrote that late guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] was "an ignorant, barbaric, untalented possessor of a guitar", among others. After reading the article, Flynn wrote "Aesthetics of Hate" as a "fuck you" to Grim and a tribute to Dimebag.

"Aesthetics of Hate" was recorded at Sharkbite Studios, in [[Oakland, California]]. Rough demos of the song were penned in February 2005 and November 2005, although contained what Flynn described as a "totally fucking lame '[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]' rip off". The song received mixed critical reviews with [[Blabbermouth.net]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Don Kaye describing the track as "literally breathtaking", while J.D. Considine of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' thought "calls for biblical vengeance just sound silly." The song has been nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].

==Background==
"Aesthetics of Hate" was written by Machine Head vocalist and guitarist [[Robert Flynn]]. Written as a retaliation to an article by William Grim for the conservative web site Iconoclast, the article praised [[Dimebag Darrell]]'s murder by [[Nathan Gale]], while Darrell was performing with the band [[Damageplan]] on [[December 8]], [[2004]]. Titled "Aesthetics of Hate: R.I.P. Dimebag Abbott, & Good Riddance", Grim wrote the article stating Darrell was "part of a generation that has confused sputum with art and involuntary reflex actions with emotion", "an ignorant, barbaric, untalented possessor of a guitar" who looks "more simian than human".<ref name="Long Live Dimebag Darrell">{{cite web

After reading the article, Flynn was furious and wrote "Aesthetics of Hate" as a "fuck you" to Grim and Dimebag detractors. He wrote a message on the band's forum expressing his friendship with Darrell and spoke about Grim:

{{Quote|What would YOU know about love or values? What would YOU know about giving to the world? All that you know is teaching prejudice, and your heart is as black as the 'ignorant, filthy, and hideously ugly, heavy metal fans' you try and paint in your twisted, fictitious ramblings. It's because of people like YOU, that there are [[Nathan Gale]]'s in this world, NOT the Dimebags and metal musicians who work to unite people through music.<ref name="Long Live Dimebag Darrell"/> |Robert Flynne

==Recording==
In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a "totally fucking lame '[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I was glad to see that part go!"<ref name="Midwest Metal">{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in [[Oakland, California]] on [[August 21]], [[2006]] to begin recording.

==Critical reception==
"Aesthetics of Hate" received mixed reviews from music critics. [[Blabbermouth.net]]'s Don Kaye described the track as "literally breathtaking" and said that the song "channels its title emotion into a blazing volcano of pure speed and furious guitarwork from Flynn and Phil Demmel."<ref name="BlabbermouthReview">{{cite web|title = Blabbermouth Review - ''The Blackening''|author=Kaye, Don|publisher = Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1066|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> Reviewing for France's ''Hard 'N Heavy'' magazine, [[Anthrax (band)|Anthrax]]'s [[Scott Ian]] felt that the song is "a riff-o-rama showing off Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel's killer guitar work."<ref name="ScottIanReview">{{cite web|title = Hard N' Heavy Review - ''The Blackening''|author=Ian, Scott|publisher = Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70735|accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> 
Thom Jurek of [[All Music Guide]] felt "the intense dual [[arpeggio]]s between both guitarists -- Flynn and [[Phil Demmel]] on 'Aesthetics of Hate' (as just one example) are among the tightest ever".<ref name="All Music Guide - The Blackening">{{cite web
