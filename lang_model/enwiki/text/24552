'''Pavlov's House''' (<U+0434><U+043E><U+043C> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+2014>''dom Pavlova'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) became the name of a well-defended [[apartment]] building during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in [[1942]]<U+2013>[[1943]]. It gained its popular name from Sergeant [[Yakov Pavlov]], who commanded the [[platoon]] that seized the building and defended it throughout the long vicious battle.

==The building==

The house was a four-story building in the city centre of [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]], built parallel to the embankment of the river [[Volga]] and overseeing the "[[January 9|9th January]] Square", a large square named for [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]]. The house was attacked by the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invaders]] in September [[1942]]. A platoon of the [[13th Guards Division]] was ordered to seize and defend it. The platoon was commanded by [[Yakov Pavlov|Yakov Pavlov]], a junior commander replacing his wounded superior. They were successful, although only four men survived the combat. Together they went on defending the building on their own. After several days, reinforcements finally arrived, equipping the defenders with [[machine-gun]]s, [[anti-tank rifle]]s and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s. The men, now a [[garrison]] of twenty-five, surrounded the building with barbed wire and [[land mine|minefields]], and established anti-tank and machine-gun posts at the windows. For better internal communications and supplies they breached the walls in the basement and upper floors, and dug a communications [[trench warfare|trench]] to [[USSR|Soviet]] positions outside. Supplies were brought in via the trench or by boats crossing the river, defying German air raids and shelling. 

Nevertheless food and especially water was in short supply. Lacking beds, the soldiers tried to sleep on insulation wool torn off pipes, yet usually the Germans kept shooting at the house with deafening machine-gun fire day and night. The Germans attacked the building several times a day. Each time German infantry or tanks tried to cross the square and to close in on the house, Pavlov's men took them under heavy fire from within the basement, from the windows and from the roof top. Leaving behind a square covered with corpses and steel, the Germans had to retreat again.

Eventually the defenders, as well as the Russian [[civilian]]s who kept living in the basement all that time, held out during intensive fighting from [[23 September]] until [[25 November]] [[1942]], when they were relieved by the counter-attacking Soviet forces.

==Symbolic meaning==

Pavlov's House became a symbol of the stubborn resistance of the Soviet Union in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], and in the [[Great Patriotic War]] in general. It stands out prominently because the German armies had previously conquered cities and entire countries within weeks; yet they were unable to capture a single half-ruined house, defended most of the time by just over a dozen soldiers, in spite of trying for two months. It is reported that the building at the "9th January Square" was marked as a [[fortress]] in German [[cartography|map]]s.

Chuikov, the defender of Stalingrad, was later heard to comment that Pavlov's men killed more Germans than were lost in the [[liberation of Paris]].

[[Yakov Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s "House"  was rebuilt after the battle and is still used as an apartment building today. There is an attached memorial constructed from bricks picked up after the battle on the East side facing the [[Volga]].

Pavlov was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] for his actions.

== Dramatization ==
*In the computer and console game ''[[Call of Duty]]'' there is a level in which the player, as a conscripted Russian peasant, must participate in capturing and defending this structure from multiple waves of German soldiers and armor until Soviet reinforcements arrive.
*In early versions of the ''[[Red Orchestra (game mod)|Red Orchestra]]'' modification for the game ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'' there was a level that recreated the fighting between the Soviet and German forces for the control of the building.
