The '''Orange Metrolink Station''' is a railroad station located in Orange, California on a site at one time occupied by two former [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] combination depots. The present depot structure was dedicated on [[May 1]], [[1938]] and was closed with the Santa Fe's discontinuation of passenger service in 1971. The building was granted historic landmark status by the City on [[November 15]], [[1990]]. 

The town's first rail service, the Santa Ana, Orange & Tustin Street Railway, was a 4.04 mile (6.5 km) long [[horsecar]] line that ran between Santa Ana and Orange, beginning in 1886. One year later the Santa Ana & Orange Motor Road Company purchased the line, using a steam "dummy" car and a single gasoline motorcar as its means of conveyance.  In 1906 [[Henry E. Huntington]] acquired the company under the auspices of the Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway and electrified the line. Passenger service over the new line operated by Huntington's [[Pacific Electric Railway]] began on [[June 8]], [[1914]], originating at the PE's depot on Lemon Street. The route provided freight service to the local citrus growers in direct competition with the Santa Fe. Pacific Electric sold out to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad ]] in 1961, who ultimately abandoned the line in 1964.

The Santa Fe, under its affiliate the [[Southern California Railway]], laid its first tracks through Orange in 1886 and established its first depot the following year.  The route would become part of the railroad's famous "[[Surf Line]]" and by 1925 sixteen daily passenger trains (the Santa Fe's ''[[San Diegan]]'') made stops in Orange. During peak growing seasons, as many as 48 carloads of [[citrus]] [[fruits]], [[olives]], and [[walnuts]] were shipped daily from the Orange depot as well. Rail connections to Los Angeles, the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]], and [[San Diego County, California|Northern San Diego County]] by the [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] regional commuter rail network.  The Metrolink platform is situated adjacent to the former Santa Fe depot in the downtown Historic District, which is also home to an [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] (OCTA) [[bus]] station. The former Santa Fe mainline links the cities of [[Los Angeles]], [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], and [[San Diego]] via a junction north of the station.
