==Plot==
<!-- Per Wikipedia "television episode" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->
The office staffers hold a "[[Secret Santa]]" gift exchange at their Christmas party. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) received [[Pam Beesly]]'s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) name, and puts a great deal of effort into getting her the perfect gift (a teapot filled with some small items and a personal letter from him to her). [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) buys a $400 [[iPod (5G)|video iPod]] as his gift to [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B.J. Novak]]), far exceeding the $20 limit. He is disappointed by the handmade item he receives from [[Phyllis Lapin]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) and introduces a "[[White elephant gift exchange|Yankee Swap]]", in which someone can choose to steal someone else's gift or open a new one. 

Jim is left feeling uncertain about the fate of his special present for Pam<U+2014>which is eventually claimed by Dwight<U+2014>while the staff competes for the iPod.  Although Pam ends up with the iPod at the end of the swap, she elects to trade the iPod for Jim's gift that was meant for her to show her appreciation. While she goes through the various aspects of her gift, Jim sneaks the letter he wrote for her into his pocket. 

After ruining his staff's mood, Michael disobeys company policy by buying an obscene amount of alcohol  for the Christmas party to compensate. Everyone ends up having a good time, with the exception of [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]), who is furious that she received no appreciation for her efforts toward arranging the Christmas party, as well as the fact that Kelly makes advances on Dwight, whom Angela is secretly dating. The episode ends with a drunken [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) exposing herself to a shocked Michael, who takes a picture and then quickly flees.

"Christmas Party" was written by [[Michael Schur]], who portrays [[List of The Office (U.S. TV series) characters#Mose Schrute|Mose Schrute]] in the series. The episode was his third contribution after the first season entry "[[The Alliance (The Office)|The Alliance]]" and second season episode "[[Office Olympics]]".<ref name="episode"/><ref name="alliance">{{cite episode| title=The Alliance | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Bryan Gordon]] (director) | writers = [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=April 12, 2005 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref><ref name="officeolympics">{{cite episode| title=Office Olympics | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Paul Feig]] (director) | writers = [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=October 4, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 3}}</ref> [[B.J. Novak]] later noted that, compared to Schur's previous episode "The Alliance", the "driving force of the mayhem" in the episode is Michael's desire to make all of his workers "happy", rather than him being "a jerk".<ref name=novak>Novak, B.J. (Writer). 2006. "Christmas Party" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> The scene wherein Dwight plugs the Christmas tree in, only for the office to be underwhelmed by the dismal lights was based on a real moment Schur and his wife experienced during their first Christmas together.<ref name=schur>Schur, Michael (Writer). 2006. "Christmas Party" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> Schur based the Christmas party sequences were based on a scene in ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' that happens after the main character does his [[Vietnam]] play. He noted that he wanted it to be "pastiche-y" and feature "small groups of people talking to each other".<ref name=schur/> Meredith flashing Michael was based on a real-life experience [[Greg Daniels]]'s dad had at a former job. He noted that at the end of one particular Christmas party, there was a stain on the office couch, which he called an "inappropriate ending" for the party. Daniels father kept pressuring him to make a Christmas episode of ''The Office'', and so Daniels utilized this experience.<ref name=greg>Daniels, Greg (Writer). 2006. "Christmas Party" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref>

Daniels was unsure as to what to call the Christmas exchange. He had heard the names "Nasty Christmas", "White Elephant", and "Yankee Swap" used to describe the game, and so he wrote all three into the script in order "to cover all regions of the country".<ref name=greg/> Schur created a list of who receives what gift in order to preserve continuity in the episode.<ref name=schur/> Gifts featured in the episode include Toby giving Angela a baby poster, Kelly getting Oscar a shower radio, Michael buying Ryan an iPod, Kevin buying a foot bath for himself, Creed giving Jim an old shirt, and Oscar buying Creed a keychain, and Jim purchasing Pam a teapot.<ref name=schur/> The teapot was chosen because it needed to fit other gifts inside of it, as well as be something that Dwight could have a use for later on in the episode.<ref name=greg/> Fischer was allowed to pick the color of the teapot featured in the episode. She picked teal, due to it being her then-husband [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]]'s favorite color.<ref name=jenna>Fischer, Jenna (Writer). 2006. "Christmas Party" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> Jenna Fischer recalled that fans always ask her what Jim wrote in Pam's note. Fischer noted that John Krasinski wrote the note himself and that the contents are "a secret".<ref name=jenna/>

Reportedly, the writers for the show wanted Michael to "give a cool gift that the show's co-workers would later resent".<ref name=apple/> They eventually decided that he would buy an [[iPod]] for Ryan. [[Apple Inc.]] received over four minutes of publicity for the device, despite the fact that the company did not pay for the placement.<ref name=apple>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401670.html |last=Kehaulani Goo |first=Sara |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=April 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 15, 2007 |title=Apple Gets a Big Slice Of Product-Placement Pie }}</ref> The poster that Toby gives to Angela was created by one of the show's prop workers. Several of the series' crew members brought in their own children for the picture, an act that Kate Flennery jokingly called "so great".<ref name=kate>Flannery, Kate (Writer). 2006. "Christmas Party" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> Schur revealed in the commentary for the episode that Stanley bought Kelly her nameplate, Dwight's paintballs were intended for Phyllis, Meredith bought Dwight shot glasses, Ryan got Toby a book of short stories, Angela purchased Stanley a picture frame, and Pam drew Meredith a picture of the office.<ref name=schur/> Pam's picture was initially drawn by an on-staff artist. However, the producers felt that he was not able to capture Pam's "feminine side" and so several young female artists were asked to draw the building. One was eventually chosen, and the artists returned to draw Pam's doodles in the later episode "[[Boys and Girls (The Office)|Boys and Girls]]".<ref name=jenna/>

===Directing===
[[File:KateFlanneryJune09.jpg|Actress [[Kate Flannery]]'s "flashing" scene was filmed with no monitors, in order to preserve Flannery's privacy.|200px|thumb|left]]
The episode was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], his first credit for the series.<ref name="episode">{{cite episode| title=Christmas Party | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director) | writers = [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=December 6, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 10}}</ref> McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence.<ref name=jenna/> The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell".<ref name=greg/> The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos was based on a deleted scene from the earlier [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|season two]] episode "[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation.<ref name=schur/> The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fact, but he was pleased with the final results.<ref name=greg/> According to Fischer, on the last day of shooting, the cast had a [[snowball fight]]<U+2014>a scene that is included in the episode<U+2014>which she called a "magic moment".<ref name=jenna/> Fischer later recounted that the prop [[egg nog]] and [[pigs in a blanket]] were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting.<ref name=jenna/> In order to make her scenes more real [[Phyllis Smith]] forced herself to cry for "30 minutes" between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character.<ref name=jenna/> The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show duly feature a liquor store working wearing a tie.<ref name=schur/> Several of the scenes were [[improvised]] on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, [[Angela Martin]] was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them.<ref name=jenna/> Kate Flannery Improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.<ref name=kate/>

During the flashing scene, Carell told Flannery that he "wasn't staring at" her breasts, rather, he was looking at her [[clavicle]]. Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery was not completely topless, as she was wearing [[pasties]]. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating and it felt like they had been shooting the one scene for "14 hours".<ref name=kate/> To preserve Flannery's privacy, the series' monitors were shut off and the card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.<ref name=jenna/>

The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Oscar and Creed moving a desk, Phyllis confiding to the camera that her new boyfriend is Bob Vance, Dwight comparing humans opening presents to bears, Kevin singing "[[Christmas in Hollis]]" by [[Run DMC]], Angela scolding Kelly, and Michael explaining that Christmas is about seeing people envy the gifts that you give to others.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2006 |title=Deleted scenes for "Christmas Party" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Two'' Disc 2 }}</ref>
