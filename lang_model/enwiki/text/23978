'''''Research-Technology Management''''' ('''''RTM''''') is an award-winning journal published by the [[Industrial Research Institute]] (IRI). It publishes peer-reviewed, research-based articles and personal perspective pieces written by and for R&D practitioners. Published bimonthly, the journal is offered both in print and electronically to subscribers interested in the management of innovation. IRI members receive a complimentary annual subscription as a benefit of membership.

Oversight of ''RTM'' is handled by an appointed Board of Editors, led by the Editor-in-Chief; the Managing Editor handles day-to-day operations.

==History==

''RTM'' was initially launched as ''Research Management (RM)'' in the spring of 1958;<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/research-management/oclc/1641234/editions?referer=di&editionsView=true WorldCat Online Library Resource: ''Research Management''], accessed Feb. 17, 2012.</ref> its mission was to serve as the vehicle for dissemination of information on techniques of organization, administration, and operation of industrial research.<ref>Burrill, Charles. ''Research Management'', Interscience Publishers, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1958), p. 3.</ref> According to Charles Burrill, the first chairman of the Board of Editors for ''RM'', <U+201C>Why another publication? Because there has been no one place to turn for the latest ideas regarding research management discussions from the research administrator<U+2019>s point of view.<U+201D><ref>Burrill, Charles. ''Research Management'', Interscience Publishers, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1958), p. 3.</ref> ''RM'' was published quarterly, in digest format, averaging 64 pages per issue. In 1962, the quarterly schedule was upgraded to a bimonthly publication schedule in response to heightened demand and increased research output from IRI membership.
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, new editorial features and departments were added, including <U+201C>Perspectives,<U+201D> <U+201C>Information Resources,<U+201D> and <U+201C>Managers at Work.<U+201D> <U+201C>The Human Side,<U+201D> now a regular column, appeared as a Q&A exploring difficult scenarios in managing human resources for R&D. In 1982, IRI began presenting the [[Maurice Holland Award]] for the best paper published in ''RM'' during the previous year. In 1985, ''RM'' began publishing the ''R&D Trends Forecast'', which summarized the data collected during IRI<U+2019>s annual survey of its member companies<U+2019> spending expectations for the coming year. The article continues to be published in the first issue of ''RTM'' each year.
 
In 1988, as part of a redesign marking the journal<U+2019>s thirtieth anniversary, ''Research Management'' was renamed ''Research-Technology Management (RTM)''. ''RTM'' retained ''RM<U+2019>s'' focus on practitioner-oriented articles, pursuing IRI<U+2019>s mission of <U+201C>enhancing technological innovation in industry.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.iriweb.org Industrial Research Institute, Inc.]], accessed Feb. 17, 2012.</ref> Authors are generally respected R&D experts in well-known organizations, with some representation of academic researchers. 
 
''RTM'' has been offered electronically since 2001 via [[Ingenta]], with issues as far back as the November-December issue of 1998 available.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iri/rtm IngentaConnect Publications: RTM], accessed Feb. 17, 2012.</ref> In 2007, the journal became available on [[iTunes]]. In 2011, the journal underwent a redesign; the new layout was unveiled in the January-February 2012 issue<U+2014>marking the beginning of ''RTM<U+2019>s'' 55th year of publication.<ref>[http://www.iamot.com/?p=200 "A Fresh Look for Research-Technology Management"], ''International Association for Management of Technology'', January 6, 2012, accessed Feb. 17, 2012.</ref>
