Their third album ''Midnight Memories'' (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a "slightly rockier and edgier" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80s rock<ref name=Rebellion>[http://whstherebellion.com/?p=51482].</ref> and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in "Little White Lies". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/one-directions-midnight-memories-what-660135 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Kyle | last=Jaeger | title=One Direction's 'Midnight Memories': What the Critics Are Saying | date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, the band performed on the [[Children in Need 2011]] broadcast, helping raise over 26 million pounds.<ref name="Daily Mail">{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2063412/Children-In-Need-2011-Sir-Terry-Wogan-wowed-Tess-Daly-Alesha-Dixon-Fearne-Cotton.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Wogan's angels: Sir Terry is wowed by golden girls trio Tess Daly, Alesha Dixon and Fearne Cotton on Children in Need | first1=Jessica | last1=Satherley | first2=J J | last2=Anisiobi | date=18 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2012 they extended their involvement with Children in Need as they opened the telecast with a performance of their single [[Live While We're Young]].

For [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]<U+2019>s Christmas campaign, they will be filming a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate <U+00A3>2.<ref name="Sugarscape">[http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/film-and-tv/999397/one-direction-join-itv%E2%80%99s-text-santa-charity-campaign].</ref>

In September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity called and Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar based in his hometown. Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down. Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that "there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick".<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/homepage/764642/niall-horans-charity-event-crashes-website].</ref> Horan later reflected on the fundraisings saying that he was "honoured to be able to give back to his community".

In 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity in order to help raise money for cancer research.<ref name="Trekstock">
[http://trekstock.com/our-story/patrons-ambassadors/].</ref>  As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive "#HangwithLiam&Harry" global campaign. They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984. Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to "complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease.
