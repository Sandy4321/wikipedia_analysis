'''Impulse Airlines''' was an independent [[airline]] in [[Australia]] which operated regional and [[low-cost airline|low cost]] trunk services between [[1994]] and [[2001]]. It was acquired by [[Qantas]] in 2001 and later formed the basis of Qantas' low-cost airline [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]].

== History ==
Impulse Airlines was established in 1992 and started operations on [[18 December]] [[1992]]. It commenced regional airline services in March [[1994]] following the acquisition by the Impulse Transportation Group of [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales|Port Macquarie]] based Oxley Airlines. Impulse Airlines was based in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The Airline's Managing Director was Gerry McGowan until the McGowan family sold the airline to Qantas in [[2001]]. The airline operated a network of regional routes throuout [[New South Wales]]. The network initially included routes to [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], [[Brisbane]], [[Canberra]], [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]], [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]], [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], [[Kempsey, New South Wales|Kempsey]], [[Melbourne]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales|Port Macquarie]] [[Sydney]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] and [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]]. The airline operated a fleet of [[Beechcraft 1900]] aircraft. It was affiliated with the [[Ansett]] frequent flyer programme and its flights had designated AN flight numbers.

In August [[1994]], Impulse Airlines expanded its fleet and became the first Australian operator of the [[BAe Jetstream 41|BAe Jetstream 41]]. It acquired five of the type in 1994 and had planned to acquire a further five in [[1996]]. Impulse used the aircraft to pioneer non-stop services between Newcastle and Melbourne but was soon met with competiton from Qantas who utilised the much larger [[BAe 146]] on the route. Impulse was forced to discontinue the services and withdraw the Jetstream 41s from service. After Qantas lost interest in the route following Impulse's withdrawal, Impulse eventually re-entered the route with Beech 1900s in February [[1997]].

In June 2000 the airline accuired [[Boeing 717]] jet aircraft and commenced operations as a [[low-cost airline]] on Australia's trunk eastern seaboard routes in direct competition with [[Qantas]] and [[Ansett]]. The airline had ceased its previous affiliation with Ansett. Services initially operated between [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] and quickly expanded to include [[Brisbane]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Hobart]]. Together with [[Virgin Blue]] which also commenced services in mid-2000, Impulse Airlines brought upon a substantial restructuring of the Australian airline industry. The new low cost entrants injected competition into the long-lived duopoly between [[Qantas]] and [[Ansett]] which arguably contributed to the downfall of the latter. The airline gradually began to phase in a catchy blue livery with a [[cockatoo]] on the tail of its aircraft.

The airline was acquired by Qantas in November [[2001]], and Impulse was absorbed into the QantasLink group of subsidiary airlines. The introduction of the cockatoo livery did not progress beyond a few aircraft. Both the Boeing 717 and Beech 1900 aircraft were initially utilised in the QantasLink fleet however the Beech 1900s were soon withdrawn from service while the Boeing 717 fleet was expanded. Impulse Airlines ceased operations on [[24 May]] [[2004]] and was used as a vehicle upon which Qantas' low-cost airline [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] was launched. Jetstar started operations on [[25 May]] [[2004]] [http://www.jetstar.com.au/aboutUs/ourCompany/]. The Impulse brand was replaced with Jetstar. 

The airline was a major sponsor of the [[Newcastle Knights]] rugby league team. The Newcastle base which was developed by Impulse Airlines continues to be the base for [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]]. Jetstar's headquarters are in [[Melbourne]].
