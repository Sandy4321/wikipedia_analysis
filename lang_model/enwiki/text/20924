==History==

The album was written in a cabin in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] and recorded in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, with producer [[Will Yip]].<ref name="utgr" /> The album will be released with a 48-page book, ''Yesterday's Home'', which was written about the process of making the album and includes all of the lyrics as well. Some of the proceeds from the new record will benefit causes advancing and encouraging youth involvement in the arts and music, such as all-ages spaces, creative workshops, programming, and education. A tour has also been announced for the spring with [[Pianos Become the Teeth]] and [[Mansions (band)|Mansions]].<ref name="bv" /> A national tour will start on March 14, 2014 and an international tour will start on April 27, 2014.

This release will be the first without longtime supporters [[No Sleep Records]], instead being released on their own label Better Living with help from Staple Records.
