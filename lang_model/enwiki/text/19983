The '''Straight River''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[Cannon River]], 45&nbsp;miles (73&nbsp;km) long, in southeastern [[Minnesota]] in the [[United States]].  Via the Cannon River, it is part of the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the [[Mississippi River]], draining an area of approximately 450&nbsp;square miles (1,165&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in an agricultural region.  

Its name is a translation of ''Owatonna'', the [[Sioux language|Dakota]] name for the river.  Despite its name, the river flows in a winding course, though its valley is fairly straight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/index.cfm |title=Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia. |accessdate=2007-06-24 |last=Upham |first=Warren |publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]] |pages=[http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/waterway.cfm?PlaceNameID=8791&BookCodeID=53&County=74&SendingPage=Results.cfm Steele County]}}</ref>  The river provided [[hydropower]] for [[flour]] [[mill]]ing operations in the 19th century.<ref name=MNDNR>{{cite web |url= http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/canoeing/straightriver/index.html |title= Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Canoeing: Straight River |publisher= [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-06-17}}</ref>

==Geography==
The [[source (river or stream)|source]] of the Straight River is considered to be just north of [[Geneva, Minnesota|Geneva]] in [[Geneva Township, Minnesota|Geneva Township]] in northern [[Freeborn County, Minnesota|Freeborn County]],<ref name=GNIS/><ref name=GE/> though its headwaters have been altered by the construction of agricultural [[ditch]]es.  The river flows northwardly through [[Steele County, Minnesota|Steele County]] into southern [[Rice County, Minnesota|Rice County]], passing through the cities of [[Owatonna, Minnesota|Owatonna]] and [[Medford, Minnesota|Medford]], to its mouth at the Cannon River in [[Faribault, Minnesota|Faribault]].<ref name=DeLorme>{{cite book| title= Minnesota Atlas & Gazetteer |year=1994 |publisher= [[DeLorme]] |location=Yarmouth, Me. |isbn= 0-89933-222-6 |pages= pp. 24, 33}}</ref>

The [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] has identified the Straight River as a route for [[canoeing]].  The river flows generally through farmland; its narrow [[riparian zone|riparian]] corridor is wooded, predominantly by [[elm]], [[willow]], [[poplar]] and [[maple]].  Its course is characterized by occasional [[riffle]]s, with one section of [[rapid]]s in [[Clinton Falls Township, Minnesota|Clinton Falls Township]] in northern Steele County.  Fish species in the river include [[northern pike]], [[crappie]], [[smallmouth bass]] and [[carp]].<ref name=MNDNR/><ref name=DeLorme/>

==Flow rate==
At the [[United States Geological Survey]]'s [[stream gauge]] upstream of [[Faribault, Minnesota|Faribault]], the annual mean flow of the river between 1966 and 2005 was 293&nbsp;[[cubic feet per second]] (8&nbsp;[[cubic meters per second|m<U+00B3>/s]]).  The highest recorded flow during the period was 6,080&nbsp;ft<U+00B3>/s (172&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s) on [[June 12]], [[2004]].  The lowest recorded flow was 10&nbsp;ft<U+00B3>/s (0&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s) on [[October 27]], [[1976]].<ref name=USGS/>
