==NARAL Pro-Choice America==
Totten first worked with NARAL as the executive director of [[Maryland]] NARAL from 1993-1996. During her tenure, she served as the organization's chief lobbyist and strategist, chairperson for the state pro-choice coalition, director of the political action committee, and was responsible for raising the annual operating and program budgets<ref name=CAPBio />. She served as the affiliate representative to the national NARAL Pro-Choice America Board of Directors, and her affiliate received numerous awards during her tenure there, including the 1993 Campus Organizing Award, 1994 Diversity Organizing Award and 1995 Outstanding Affiliate Award<ref name=AboutPresident />.

In 1996, Totten took a position with NARAL's national office as its political director. While there, she worked to develop the organization's first nationwide pro-choice voter file, which consisted of 2.9 million [[pro-choice]] identified voters in 2000. She also devised all of NARAL's advocacy campaigns, including numerous ballot initiative campaigns, legislative battles, and the Stop [[John Ashcroft|Ashcroft]]! campaign in 2001. During the 2000 elections, she created and implemented a US$12 million electoral program, with campaigns in 16 states for the Presidential contest, eight Senate races, and 24 House races.

==Progressive Majority==
In 2001, Totten was recruited to head the newly created group Progressive Majority, which was designed to help elect progressive candidates at all levels of the US government. Since its inception, Progressive Majority has elected 272 candidates and has built up a "farm team" of almost 500 potential candidates. Under her leadership, the organization has expanded to eight states, and  has developed into the most comprehensive national progressive candidate recruitment program in the country. Gloria also worked to establsih Progressive Majority's Racial Justice Campaign, which works to elect candidates of color and increase the diversity of local and state governments. Her stated aim is to "take back the state legislatures, and then take those states off the table in national elections<ref>Conniff, Ruth. "How to Build a Farm Team." ''The Nation.'' June 8, 2006.</ref>." Progressive Majority's ultimate goal, though, is to take over state legislatures by 2010 in order to put [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in control of [[redistricting]].
