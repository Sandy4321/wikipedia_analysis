The '''Bayreuth<U+2013>Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg''' line is a single-track main line railway in the [[German state]] of [[Bavaria]]. It is an important section of the so-called ''[[Saxony|Saxon]]-[[Franconia|Franconian]] railway'' from [[Dresden]] to [[Nuremberg]]. The line was opened in 1853 and is one of the [[List of the first German railways to 1870|oldest railways in Germany]].
==History ==
It was the first Bavarian railway line to be built and leased to the state. That is, it was financed by the city of Bayreuth and the line was built and subsequently leased by the Bavarian government. The route from Neuenmarkt to Bayreuth was opened on 28 November 1853 by the [[Royal Bavarian State Railways]] as one of the first branch lines of the [[Ludwig South-North Railway]]. In 1905 the line was nationalised. 
==Operations==
The line connects with the [[Bamberg<U+2013>Hof railway|Bamberg<U+2013>Hof line]] in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, leading to [[Bamberg]] and [[Hof]].

In the past trains from Bayreuth had to change direction in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to continue up the famous [[Schiefe Ebene]] ({{lang-de|inclined plane}}) to Hof. The opening of the Schl<U+00F6>men curve in 2001, which allows Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg to be bypassed to the east, improved the connectivity of the line to the northeast considerably. As a result, even some long-distance trains ([[ICE TD]]) on the [[Nuremberg]]<U+2013>[[Dresden]] route now use the line. Since December 2006, services of the Franken-Sachsen-Express have run on the line at 2-hour intervals; after a period when no trains used the Schloemen curve at all.
