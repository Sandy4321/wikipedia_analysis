A '''hedge fund''' is a private [[investment fund]] which may invest in a diverse range of assets and may employ a variety of investment strategies to maintain a [[hedge (finance)|hedged]] portfolio intended to protect the fund's investors from downturns in the market while maximizing returns on market upswings.

Hedge funds are distinct from [[mutual funds]], individual retirement and investment accounts, and other types of traditional investment portfolios in a number of ways. As a class, hedge funds undertake a wider range of investment and trading activities than traditional [[Long (finance)|long]]-only investment funds, and invest in a broader range of assets, including [[Stock|equities]], [[Bond (finance)| bonds]] and [[commodities]]. By taking a long position on a particular asset the manager is asserting that this position is likely to increase in value. When the manager takes a short position in another asset they would be asserting that the asset is likely to decrease in value. Most hedge fund investment strategies aim to secure positive return on investment regardless of overall market performance. Hedge fund managers typically invest their own money in the fund they manage, which serves to align their interests with investors in the fund.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Handbook of Alternative Assets |last=Anson |first=Mark J.P. |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn= 047198020X |page=123}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hedge Fund Manager<U+2019>s Farewell |first=Joe |last=Nocera |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/business/16nocera.htm |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref> Investors in hedge funds typically pay a management fee that goes toward the operational costs of the fund, and a [[performance fee]] when the fund<U+2019>s [[net asset value]] is higher than that of the previous year.

Hedge funds are only open for investment to a limited number of accredited or qualified investors who meet criteria set by regulators. Because hedge funds are not sold to the public or [[Financial_market_participants#Retail_investor|retail investors]] its advisers have historically not been subject to the same restrictions that govern other [[collective investment scheme|investment fund]] advisers, with regard to how the fund may be structured and how strategies are employed. However, hedge funds must comply with many of the same statutory and regulatory restrictions as other institutional market participants.<ref name=Overview>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/htext/d09677t.html |title=Hedge Funds: Overview of Regulatory Oversight, Counterparty Risks, and Investment Challenges |first=Orice M. |last= Williams |date=7 May 2009 |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> Regulations passed in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] after the [[Financial crisis (2007-present)|2008 credit crisis]] are intended to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate any regulatory gaps.<ref name=Ismail>{{cite news |title=Institutions Damp Hedge Fund <U+2018>Startup Spirit,<U+2019> Citi<U+2019>s Roe Says |first=Netty |last=Ismail |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-21/institutions-damp-hedge-fund-startup-spirit-citi-s-roe-says.html |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Sociologist, author, and financial journalist [[Alfred Winslow Jones|Alfred W. Jones]] is credited with the creation of the first hedge fund in 1949.<ref name=Anson>{{cite book |title=The Handbook of Alternative Assets |last=Anson |first=Mark J.P. |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn= 047198020X |page=36}}</ref> Jones believed that changes in asset prices can be attributed partly to factors specific to the asset in question and partly to trends in the market as a whole. To neutralize the effect of overall market movement, he balanced his portfolio by buying assets whose price he expected to increase in the future, relative to the overall performance of the market, and [[short (finance)|selling short]] assets whose price he expected to decrease. He saw that price movements due to the overall market would balance out because, if the overall market rose, the loss on shorted assets would be cancelled by the additional gain on longed assets and vice-versa. By taking this approach his investment strategy was [[market neutral]], as returns depended only on him picking the right stock, not on whether the stock market went up or down. Jones referred to his fund as being "hedged" to describe how the fund managed risk exposure from overall market movement.<ref name=Lhabitant>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Hedge Funds |last=Lhabitant |first=Fran<U+00E7>ois-Serge |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=0470026634 |page=10}}</ref> This type of portfolio became known as a hedge fund.<ref name=Ubide>{{cite news |title=Demystifying Hedge Funds |first=Angel |last=Ubide |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/06/basics.htm |magazine=Finance & Development |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=June 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref>

Jones added a 20% performance fee in 1952 and converted his fund to a limited partnership, and thereby became the first money manager to combine a hedged investment strategy, [[leverage]] and shared risk, with compensation based on investment performance. At this time, only a few investors had adopted Jones' investment structure as it was not well known in the financial community. Attention was drawn to the fund and Jones' strategies in 1966 when Carol Loomis, a writer for ''Fortune'' magazine, wrote an article about Jones called "The Jones Nobody Keeps Up With". The article noted that Jones<U+2019> fund outperformed the best mutual funds even after the 20% performance fee and this news led to great interest within the financial community.<ref name=Ineichen>{{cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen
|year=2002 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn=0471251208 |pages=8<U+2013>21}}</ref>

By 1968 there were around 200 hedge funds, and the first [[Fund of funds|fund of hedge funds]] was created in 1969 in [[Geneva]]. Many of the early funds ceased trading due to the market downturns in [[Recession of 1969-70|1969<U+2013>70]] and [[1973-1974 stock market crash|1973<U+2013>74]] as they did not manage their risk. In the 1970s hedge funds typically specialized only in one strategy, and most fund managers followed the long/short equity model created by Jones. Hedge funds lost their popularity during the downturn of the 1970s but received renewed attention in the late 1980s, following the success of several funds profiled in the media.<ref name=Ineichen/> During the 1990s the number of hedge funds increased significantly, with investments provided by the new wealth that was generated in the [[Dot-com bubble|1990s stock market rise]].<ref name=Ubide>{{cite news |title=Demystifying Hedge Funds |first=Angel |last=Ubide |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/06/basics.htm |magazine=Finance & Development |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=June 2006 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref> The increase in the number of hedge funds resulted from traders and investors being attracted to the aligned-interest compensation structure and the freedom of participating in an investment vehicle that was not benchmark-driven.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hedge funds of funds investing: an investor's guide |last=Nicholas |first=Joseph G. |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=1576601242 |page=11}}</ref> Over the next decade there was also a marked diversification in the [[Hedge_fund#Strategies|strategies]] funds utilized, including: credit arbitrage, distressed debt, fixed income, quantitative, and multi-strategy, among others. This industry expansion led to hedge funds becoming more heterogeneous than they had before.<ref name=Ineichen/>

==Industry size==
Estimates of industry size vary widely due to the absence of central statistics, the lack of an agreed definition of hedge funds and the rapid growth of the industry.  As a general indicator of scale, the industry reached a peak in the second quarter of 2008 when it managed $1.93 trillion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hedge fund industry assets swell to $1.92 trillion

===Largest hedge fund managers===
{{As of|2011|1|1|df=US}} the largest 225 hedge fund managers in the United States held a total of $1.297 trillion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutereturn-alpha.com/Article/2775999/Billion-dollar-club.html?ArticleId=2775999 |title=Billion dollar club |last1=Allen |first1=Katrina Dean |date=2 March 2011 |work=Absolute Return |publisher= |accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref> The largest manager in 2010 was [[Bridgewater Associates]] at $58.9 billion assets under management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41871000/225_Hedge_Funds_in_Billion_Dollar_Club

==Fees==
A hedge fund manager will typically receive both a [[management fee]] and a [[performance fee]] (also known as an incentive fee) from the fund. Hedge funds use varying fee structures,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Hedge Fund Book |last=Wilson |first=Richard C. |year=2010 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=0470520639 |page=6 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> however they typically charge fees of "2 and 20", which refers to a management fee of 2% of the fund's [[net asset value]] each year and a performance fee of 20% of the fund's profit, although this charging structure has come under pressure recently as fund returns have declined.<ref name="Roadmap">{{cite web|url=http://www.aima.org/download.cfm/docid/6133E854-63FF-46FC-95347B445AE4ECFC |title=AIMA Roadmap to Hedge Funds |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

===Management fees===
As with other [[Collective Investment Scheme|investment funds]], the management fee is calculated as a percentage of the fund's [[net asset value]]. Management fees typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being the standard figure.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html?ref=yourmoney New York Times, "2 + 20, And Other Hedge Math", Mark Hulbert, March 4, 2007.]</ref> <ref>http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_20/b4034053.htm</ref> Management fees are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly.

The business models of most hedge fund managers provide for the management fee to cover the operating costs of the manager, leaving the performance fee for employee bonuses. However, the management fees for large funds may form a significant part of the manager's profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cf7f91e2-f3f0-11dd-9c4b-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Financial Rimes, "Hedge fund investors have a great chance to cut fees", James Mackintosh, 6 February 2009 |publisher=Ft.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Management fees associated with hedge funds have been under much scrutiny, with several large public pension funds, notably [[CalPERS]], calling on managers to reduce fees.

===Performance fees===
[[Performance fee]]s (or "incentive fees") are one of the defining characteristics of hedge funds. The manager's performance fee is calculated as a percentage of the fund's profits, usually counting both realized and unrealized profits. By motivating the manager to generate returns, performance fees are intended to align the interests of manager and investor more closely than flat fees. In the business models of most managers, the performance fee is largely available for staff bonuses and so can be extremely lucrative for managers who perform well. Several publications provide estimates of the annual earnings of top hedge fund managers.<ref>{{cite web

Typically, hedge funds charge 20% of returns as a performance fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eipny.com/pdf/HedgeFundMathWhyFeesMatter110907.pdf |title=Hedge Fund Math: Why Fees Matter (Newsletter), Epoch Investment Partners Inc. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> However, the range is wide with highly regarded managers charging higher fees. For example [[Steven A. Cohen|Steven Cohen]]'s [[SAC Capital Partners]] charges a 35<U+2013>50% performance fee,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/54/biz_06rich400_Steven-A-Cohen_PZMO.html |title=Forbes 400 Richest Americans: Stephen A. Cohen |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> while [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]]' Medallion Fund charged a 45% performance fee.

Average incentive fees have declined since the start of the financial crisis, with the decline being more pronounced in funds of hedge funds (FOFs). Incentive fees for single manager funds fell to 19.2 percent (versus 19.34 percent in Q1 08) while FOFs fell to 6.9 percent (versus 8.05 percent in Q1 08). The average incentive fee for funds launched in 2009 was 17.6 percent, 1.6 percent below the broader industry average.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.opalesque.com/IndustryUpdates/691/HFR_Hedge_fund_liquidations_fall_to_levels217.html |title= Incentive fees fall since start of the financial crisis|date=10 March 2010|author=Opalesque}}</ref>

Performance fees have been criticized by many people, including notable investor [[Warren Buffett]], who believe that, by allowing managers to take a share of profit but providing no mechanism for them to share losses, performance fees give managers an incentive to take excessive risk rather than targeting high long-term returns. In an attempt to control this problem, fees are usually limited by a high water mark. 

====High water marks====
A high water mark (or "loss carryforward provision") is often applied to a performance fee calculation. This means that the manager receives performance fees only on increases in the net asset value (NAV) of the fund in excess of the highest net asset value it has previously achieved. For example, if a fund were launched at a NAV per share of $100, which then rose to $120 in its first year, a performance fee would be payable on the $20 return for each share. If the next year it dropped to $110, no fee would be payable. If in the third year the NAV per share rose to $130, a performance fee would be payable only on the $10 profit from $120 (the high water mark) to $130, rather than on the full return during that year from $110 to $130.

The mechanism does not provide complete protection to investors: A manager who has lost a significant percentage of the fund's value may close the fund and start again with a clean slate, rather than continue working for no performance fee until the loss has been made up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/aug2005/nf2005088_1711_db042.htm |title=Hedge Funds: Fees Down? Close Shop |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2005-08-08 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> This tactic is dependent on the manager's ability to persuade investors to trust him or her with their money in the new fund.

====Hurdle rates====
Some managers specify a [[hurdle rate]], signifying that they will not charge a performance fee until the fund's annualized performance exceeds a benchmark rate, such as [[Treasury security|T-bill]] yield, [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] or a fixed percentage.<ref name="Roadmap"/> This links performance fees to the ability of the manager to provide a higher return than an alternative, usually lower risk, investment.

With a "soft" hurdle, a performance fee is charged on the entire annualized return if the hurdle rate is cleared. With a "hard" hurdle, a performance fee is only charged on returns above the hurdle rate. Before the credit crisis of 2008, demand for hedge funds tended to outstrip supply, making hurdle rates relatively rare.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Withdrawal/redemption fees===
Some funds charge investors a redemption fee (or "withdrawal fee" or "surrender charge") if they withdraw money from the fund. A redemption fee is often charged only during a specified period of time (typically a year) following the date of investment, or only to withdrawals representing a specified portion of an investment.<ref>http://www.hedgeworld.com/education/index.cgi?page=hedge_fund_basics</ref> 

The purpose of the fee is to discourage short-term investment in the fund, thereby reducing turnover and allowing the use of more complex, illiquid or long-term strategies. The fee may also dissuade investors from withdrawing funds after periods of poor performance.

Unlike management and performance fees, redemption fees are usually retained by the fund and therefore benefit the remaining investors rather than the manager.

==Strategies==
Hedge funds employ a wide range of trading strategies. Establishing a formalized system of classification is difficult due to the rapidity with which strategies change and evolve.<ref name=Connor>{{cite web |url=http://www.iam.uk.com/press/lse-publications/An-Introduction-to-Hedge-Fund-Strategies.pdf |title=An Introduction to Hedge Fund Strategy |first=Gregory |last=Connor |first=Teo |last=Lasarte |work=The London School of Economics and Political Science |publisher=International Asset Management Ltd. |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> However, hedge fund strategies are generally said to fall into four main categories: [[global macro]], directional, event-driven, and [[relative value (economics)|relative value]] ([[arbitrage]]).<ref name="Hedge Fund Tools">{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalbeacon.com/Hedge_Fund_Tools.html |title=Hedge Fund Tools <U+2013> Investment Strategies |publisher=Capital Beacon |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> These four categories are distinguished by investment style and each have their own risk and return characteristics. Managed futures or multi-strategy funds may not fit into these categories, but are nonetheless popular strategies with investors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hottest alternative?Managed-futures funds, research shows |url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20101010/REG/310109957 |work=Investment News |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> It is possible for hedge funds to commit to a certain strategy<ref name=Sadek>{{cite web |url=http://www.fortress-strategy.com/Decimation.pdf |title=Decimation of Fortunes: Where Do We Go From Here? |first=Bill |last=Sadek |publisher=Fortress Strategy USA |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>or employ multiple strategies to allow flexibility, for risk management purposes, or to achieve diversified returns.<ref name=Connor/> The hedge fund<U+2019>s prospectus, also known as an [[offering memorandum]], offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund, including the fund's investment strategy, investment type, and leverage limit.<ref name=Sadek/>

The elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include: the hedge fund's approach to the market; the particular [[Financial instrument|instrument]] used; the [[market sector]] the fund specializes in (e.g. [[healthcare]]); the method used to select investments; and the amount of diversification within the fund. There are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes, including [[Stock|equity]], [[fixed income]], [[commodity]] and [[currency]]. Instruments used include:equities, fixed income, [[futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]] and [[swap (finance)|swaps]]. Strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers, known as <U+201C>discretionary/qualitative<U+201D>, or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system, known as <U+201C>systematic/quantitative<U+201D>.<ref name=Ineichen192>{{cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen
|year=2002 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn=0471251208 |page=192}}</ref> The amount of diversification within the fund can vary; funds may be multi-strategy, multi-fund, multi-market, multi-manager or a combination.

Sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as [[absolute return]] and are classified as either [[market neutral]] or directional. Market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by <U+201C>neutralizing<U+201D> the effect of market swings, whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the market's fluctuations.<ref name=Connor/><ref name=Coggan>{{cite book |title=Guide to Hedge Funds |last=Coggan |first=Philip |year=2011 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Ltd |edition=2nd}}</ref>

===Global macro===
{{Main|Global macro}}
Hedge funds utilizing a global macro investing strategy take sizable [[Position (finance)|positions]] in share, bond or currency markets in anticipation of global [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic events]] in order to generate a risk-adjusted return.<ref name=Coggan/> Global macro fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets, the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns.<ref name=Bartolo>{{cite web |url=http://www.cai.emory.edu/documents/HF_Strategies.pdf |title=Hedge Fund Strategies Guide |first=Michael |last=Bartolo |month=September |year=2008 |work=Goizueta Business School |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.<ref name=Coggan/>

Global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches. Discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments; systematic trading is based on [[mathematics|mathematical models]] and executed by [[software]] with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software. These strategies can also be divided into [[trend following|trend]] or counter-trend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following [[market trends|trends]] (long or short-term) or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends.<ref name=Ineichen192/>

Within global macro strategies, there are further sub-strategies including "systematic diversified", in which the fund trades in diversified markets, or "systematic currency", in which the fund trades in [[currency market]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0071742867 |page=348}}</ref> Other sub-strategies include those employed by [[Commodity Trading Advisors]] (CTA), where the fund trades in [[Futures contract|futures]] (or [[option (finance)|options]]) in [[commodity]] markets or in swaps.<ref>{{cite book |title=Investment strategies of hedge funds |first=Filippo |last=Stefanini |year=2006  |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn= 0470026278 |page=223}}</ref> This is also known as a managed future fund.<ref name=Coggan/> CTAs trade in commodities (such as gold) and financial instruments, including stock indexes. In addition they take both long and short positions, allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Evaluating hedge fund performance |last=Tran |first=Vinh Q. |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=0471681717 |page=54}}</ref>

===Directional===
Directional investment strategies utilize market movements, trends, or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets. Computer models can be used, or fund managers will identify and select investments. These types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies.<ref name=Connor/><ref name=Coggan/> Directional hedge fund strategies include U.S. and international [[long/short equity]] hedge funds, where [[Long (finance)|long equity]] positions are hedged with [[Short (finance)|short sales]] of equities or equity [[Index (economics)|index]] [[Option (finance)|options]].

Within directional strategies, there are a number of sub-strategies. "[[Emerging markets]]" funds focus on emerging markets such as China and India,<ref>{{cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0071742867 |page=351}}</ref> whereas "sector funds" specialize in specific areas including technology, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, energy and basic materials. Funds using a "fundamental growth" strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall [[equity market]] or relevant sector, while funds using a "fundamental value" strategy invest in undervalued companies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0071742867 |page=344}}</ref>  Funds that use [[Statistics|quantitative]] techniques for [[Stock|equity]] [[Trader (finance)|trading]] are described as using a "quantitative directional" strategy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wave Theory for Alternative Investments |first=Stephen |last=Walker |year=2010  |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location= |isbn=0071742867 |page=345}}</ref> Funds using a "[[Short selling|short bias]]" strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using [[Short (finance)|short positions]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Create Your Own ETF Hedge Fund |first=David |last=Fry |year=2008  |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn= 0470138955 |page=68}}</ref>

===Event-driven===
{{Main|Event-driven investing}}
Event-driven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event.<ref>{{cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen
|year=2002 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn=0471251208 |page=182}}</ref> An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the [[securities|security]] or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities.<ref name=Event-Driven>{{cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/educational-articles/hedge-fund-strategy-definition/hedge-fund-strategy-event-driven.html |title=Understanding Event-Driven Investing |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=Bartolo/>

Corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage and special situations.<ref name=Bartolo/> [[Distressed securities]] include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies.<ref name=Bartolo/> A distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing [[bankruptcy]] or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks.<ref name=Coggan/> While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a [[Market_trend#Bull_market|bull market]], distressed investing works best during a [[Market_trend#Bear_market|bear market]].<ref name=Event-Driven/>  

[[Risk arbitrage]] or [[merger arbitrage]] includes such events as [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], acquisitions, liquidations, and hostile takeovers.<ref name=Bartolo/> Risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price. The risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned; hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place.<ref name=Event-Driven/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/educational-articles/hedge-fund-strategy-definition/hedge-fund-strategy-merger-arbitrage.html |title=Understanding Merger Arbitrage |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>

Special situations are events that impact the value of a company's stock, including the [[restructuring]] of a company or corporate transactions including spin-offs, share-buy-backs, security issuance/repurchase, asset sales, or other catalyst-oriented situations. To take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the company's equity and equity-related instruments.<ref name="Strategy Definitions">{{cite web |url= http://www.hedgefundresearch.com/index.php?fuse=indices-str#2703|title=HFR I Strategy Definitions |publisher=Hedge Fund Research Inc. |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>

Other event-driven strategies include: credit arbitrage strategies, which focus on corporate [[fixed income]] securities; an activist strategy, where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management; and legal catalyst strategy, which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits.

===Relative value===
{{Main|Relative value (economics)}}
Relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities. The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the [[Underlying|underlying security]] or the market overall. Hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, [[Technical analysis|technical]] or [[Fundamental analysis|fundamental]] techniques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/definitions/Relative-Value-Arbitrage-definition.html  |title=Relative Value Arbitrage definition |publisher=BarclayHedge LTD. |accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Relative value is often used as a synonym for [[market neutral]], as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole.<ref>{{cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander|last=Ineichen
|year=2002 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |location= |isbn=0471251208 |page=181}}</ref> Other relative value sub-strategies include:

*'''[[Fixed income arbitrage]]''' <U+2013> exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities.
*'''[[Equity market neutral]]''' <U+2013> exploits differences in stock prices by being [[Long (finance)|long]] and [[Short (finance)|short]] in stocks within the same sector, industry, market capitalization, country, which also creates a hedge against broader market factors.
*'''[[Convertible arbitrage]]''' <U+2013> exploit pricing inefficiencies between [[Convertible security|convertible securities]] and the corresponding [[stock]]s.
*'''Asset-backed securities''' (Fixed-Income asset-backed) <U+2013> [[fixed income arbitrage]] strategy using [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]].
*'''Credit long / short''' <U+2013> the same as long / short equity but in [[credit market]]s instead of equity markets.
*'''[[Statistical arbitrage]]''' <U+2013> identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques 
*'''Volatility arbitrage''' <U+2013> exploit the change in implied [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] instead of the change in price.
*'''Yield alternatives''' <U+2013> non-[[fixed income arbitrage]] strategies based on the yield instead of the price.
*'''Regulatory arbitrage''' <U+2013> the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets.

===Miscellaneous===
In addition to those strategies within the four main categories, there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them.

*'''[[Fund of hedge funds]]''' (Multi-manager) <U+2013> a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying single-manager hedge funds.
*'''Multi-strategy''' <U+2013> a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk.
*'''Multi-manager''' <U+2013> a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate sub-managers investing in their own strategy.
*'''[[130-30 funds]]''' <U+2013> equity funds with 130% long and 30% short positions, leaving a net long position of 100%.

==Hedge fund risk==
Because investments in hedge funds can add diversification to investment portfolios, investors may use them as a tool to reduce their overall portfolio risk exposures.<ref name=Davidoff>{{cite web |url=http://www.dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/to-reduce-hedge-fund-risk-let-everyone-in/ |title=To Reduce Hedge Fund Risk, Let Everyone In |last1=Davidoff |first1=Steven M. |last2= |first2= |date=17 September 2009 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce risk-adjusted returns, which are consistent with investors' desired level of risk.<ref name=Jones/> Hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices.<ref name=Lo>{{cite journal |last=Lo |first=Andrew |year=2001 |title=Risk Management for Hedge Funds: Introduction and Overview |journal=Financial Analysts Journal |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=16<U+2013>33 |publisher=CFA Institute |url=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCAQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphasimplex.com%2Fpdfs%2FRiskMgmtForHF.pdf&rct=j&q=risk%20management%20hedge%20funds%20andrew%20lo&ei=kn6STd2oJobliALTtOjuAQ&usg=AFQjCNEXX-iA1r5uCsxlSFyDRk1Su3lW_A&sig2=w8zt1efC7UBuNsjW0hjlhg&cad=rja |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> While "[[hedge (finance)|hedging]]" can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment, hedge funds, like all other investment types, are not immune to risk. According to a report by the Hennessee Group, hedge funds were approximately one-third less volatile than the [[S&P 500]] between 1993 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://http://www.thehedgefundjournal.com/news/2010/07/22/hennessee-protecting-capital-during-market-downturns.php |title=Hennessee: Protecting capital during market downturns |date=22 July 2010 |work=Hedge Fund Journal |accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> 

===Risk management===
Investors in hedge funds are, in most countries, required to be sophisticated qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks, and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks. Fund managers may employ extensive [[Financial risk management|risk management]] strategies in order to protect the fund and investors. According to the ''Financial Times'', "big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management."<ref name=Jones>{{cite news |title=Hedge funds: Stringent controls on losses and investment |first=Sam |last=Jones |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f253ab8-5371-11e0-86e6-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1ICqUvUmv |newspaper=Financial Times |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> Hedge fund managers may hold a large number of investment positions for short durations and are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place. Funds may have "risk officers" who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading, and may employ strategies such as formal portfolio risk models.<ref name=Cassar/> A variety of measuring techniques and models may be used to calculate the risk incurred by a hedge fund's activities; fund managers may use different models depending on their fund's structure and investment strategy.<ref name=Jaeger/><ref name=Lo/> Some factors ,such as normality of return, are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies. Funds which use [[value at risk]] as a measurement of risk may compensate for this by employing additional models such as [[Drawdown (economics)|drawdown]] and <U+201C>time under water<U+201D> to ensure all risks are captured.<ref name="risk">{{Citation|title=L<U+00F3>pez de Prado, M. and A.

In addition to assessing the market-related risks that may arise from an investment, investors commonly employ [[operational due diligence]] to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor. Considerations will include the organisation and management of operations at the hedge fund manager, whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable, and the fund's ability to develop as a company.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hedge funds: crossing the institutional frontier |last=Jaffer |first=Sohail |year=2006 |publisher=Euromoney Books |isbn=1843742683 |pages=113<U+2013>4}}</ref>

===Transparency and regulatory considerations===
Since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes perceived as a [[Transparency (market)|lack of transparency]].<ref name=IneichenRisk>{{cite book |title=Absolute Returns: the risks and opportunities of hedge fund investing |first=Alexander |last=Ineichen |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated |isbn=0471251208 |pages=441<U+2013>4}}</ref> Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud.<ref name=Jaeger/> New regulations introduced in the U.S. and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency.<ref name=Chay>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20101129-249737.html |title=Call For Joint Effort to Protect Hedge Fund Business |first= Felda |last=Chay |day=27 |month=November |year=2010 |work=The Business Times Singapore |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements.<ref name=Jones/> The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benefitscanada.com/investments/other-investments/institutional-investors-changing-the-rules-of-hedge-fund-investing-9126 |title=Institutional investors changing the rules of hedge fund investing |last1=White |first1=Jody |date=25 January 2010 |work=BenefitsCanada.com |accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> 

===Risks shared with other investment types===
Hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes, including [[liquidity risk]] and manager risk.<ref name=Jaeger>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ethz.ch/~embrechts/RM/jaeger.pdf |title=Risk Management for Hedge Fund Portfolios |first=Lars |last=Jaeger |day=28 |month=April |year=2005 |work=Presentation at ETHZ [Eidgen<U+00F6>ssische Technische Hochschule Z<U+00FC>rich] |publisher=Partners Group |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> [[Market liquidity|Liquidity]] refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money.<ref name="What is a Hedge Fund"/><ref name=Coggan>{{cite book |title=Guide to Hedge Funds |last=Coggan |first=Philip |year=2011 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Ltd |edition=2nd}}</ref> Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds.

Many investment funds use [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], the practice of [[Debt|borrowing]] money or trading on [[margin (finance)|margin]] in addition to capital from investors. Although leverage can increase potential returns, the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses.<ref name="What is a Hedge Fund"/> Hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices.<ref name=IneichenRisk/><ref name=Cassar>{{cite web |url=http://efmaefm.org/0EFMSYMPOSIUM/Toronto-2011/papers/Gerakos.pdf |title=How Do Hedge Funds Manage Portfolio Risk? |first1=Gavin |last1=Cassar |first2=Joseph |last2=Gerakos |work=EFM Symposium |publisher=European Financial Management Association |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> In comparison with investment banks, hedge fund leverage is relatively low; according to a [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] working paper, the average leverage for investment banks is 14.2, compared to between 1.5 and 2.5 for hedge funds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ang |first1=Andrew |last2=Gorovyy |first2=Sergiy |last3=van Inwegen |first3=Gregory |year=2011 |title=Hedge Fund Leverage: NBER Working Paper No. 16801 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=NBER |doi= |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w16801.pdf |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref>

Managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund.<ref name=Cassar/>

==Hedge fund structure==
A hedge fund itself has no employees and no [[asset]]s . The portfolio is managed by the [[investment management|investment manager]], a separate entity which is the actual business and has employees.

As well as the investment manager, the functions of a hedge fund are delegated to a number of other service providers. The most common service providers are:

:'''Prime broker''' <U+2013> [[prime brokerage]] services include lending money, acting as counterparty to derivative contracts, lending securities for the purpose of short selling, trade execution, clearing and settlement. Many prime brokers also provide [[custodian bank|custody]] services. Prime brokers are typically parts of large investment banks.

:'''Administrator''' <U+2013> the administrator typically deals with the issue of shares, and performs related [[back office]] functions. In some funds, particularly in the U.S., some of these functions are performed by the investment manager, a practice that gives rise to a potential conflict of interest inherent in having the investment manager both determine the NAV and benefit from its increase through performance fees. Outside of the U.S., regulations often require this role to be taken by a third party.

:'''Distributor''' <U+2013> the distributor is responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors. Frequently, this role is taken by the investment manager.

===Domicile===
The legal structure of a specific hedge fund <U+2013> in particular its [[domicile (law)|domicile]] and the type of [[legal person|legal entity]] used <U+2013> is usually determined by the tax environment of the fund<U+2019>s expected investors. [[regulation|Regulatory]] considerations will also play a role. Many hedge funds are established in [[offshore financial centre]]s so that the investor, rather than the fund, pays tax on the increase in the value of the portfolio. The investment manager, usually based in a major financial centre, will pay tax on the fees that it receives for managing the fund.

Though estimates vary, one is that around 60% of the number of hedge funds in 2010 were registered offshore, with Cayman Islands accounting for 37%, British Virgin Islands 7% and Bermuda 5%. Among onshore funds Delaware (US) accounts for 27% and the EU (primarily Ireland and Luxembourg) for 5%.<ref>[http://www.thecityuk.com/media/223457/hedge_funds_2011.pdf] TheCityUK</ref>

===Investment manager locations===
In contrast to the funds themselves, investment managers are primarily located [[onshore]] in order to draw on the major pools of financial talent and to be close to investors. With the bulk of hedge fund investment coming from the [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. East coast]] <U+2013> principally [[New York City]] and the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] area of [[Connecticut]] <U+2013> this has become the leading location for hedge fund managers. It was estimated there were 7,000 investment managers in the United States in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2333.htm#IA |title=Final Rule: Registration Under the Advisers Act of Certain Hedge Fund Advisers; Release No. Release No. IA-2333; File No. S7-30-04; December 2, 2004 |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

London is [[Europe|Europe<U+2019>s]] leading centre for hedge fund managers, with 70% of European hedge fund investments, about $420 billion, at the end of 2010. Asia, and more particularly China, is taking on a more important role as a source of funds for the global hedge fund industry. The UK and the U.S. are leading locations for management of Asian hedge funds' assets with around a quarter of the total each.<ref>[http://www.thecityuk.com/media/223457/hedge_funds_2011.pdf] TheCityUK</ref>

===The legal entity===
[[Limited partnership]]s are principally used for hedge funds aimed at US-based investors who pay tax, as the investors will receive relatively favorable tax treatment in the US. The [[limited partnership|general partner]] of the limited partnership is typically the investment manager (though is sometimes an [[offshore financial centre|offshore]] corporation) and the investors are the [[limited partnership|limited partners]]. Offshore [[company (law)|corporate]] funds are used for non-U.S. investors, which would otherwise be subject to more complex tax issues by investing in a tax-transparent entity such as a partnership, and U.S. entities that do not pay tax such as state, corporate, private and union [[pension fund]]s, which would otherwise be subject to unrelated business income tax in the United States. [[Unit trust]]s are sometimes used to market to Japanese investors. Other than taxation, the type of entity used does not have a significant bearing on the nature of the fund.


The investment manager, which will have organized the establishment of the hedge fund, may retain an interest in the hedge fund, either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of <U+201C>founder shares<U+201D> in a corporate fund. Founder shares typically have no economic rights, and voting rights over only a limited range of issues, such as selection of the investment manager. The fund<U+2019>s strategic decisions are taken by the [[board of directors]] of the fund, which is independent but generally loyal to the investment manager.

===Open-ended nature===
Hedge funds are typically [[Open-end fund|open-ended]], meaning that the fund will periodically accept further investment and allow investors to withdraw their money from the fund. For a fund structured as a company, shares will be both issued and redeemed at the [[net asset value]] (<U+201C>NAV<U+201D>) per share, so that if the value of the underlying investments has increased (and the NAV per share has therefore also increased) then the investor will receive a larger sum on redemption than it paid on investment. Similarly, where a fund is structured as a limited partnership the investor's account will be allocated its proportion of any increase or decrease in the NAV of the fund, allowing an investor to withdraw more (or less) when it withdraws its capital.

Investors do not typically [[trader (finance)|trade]] shares or limited partnership interests among themselves and hedge funds do not typically [[dividend|distribute profits]] to investors before redemption. This contrasts with a [[closed-end fund|closed-ended fund]], which either has a limited number of shares which are traded among investors, and which distributes its profits, or which has a limited lifespan at the end of which capital is returned to investors. Most hedge funds have quarterly liquidity, others have semi-annual or annual liquidity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/ia-2266.htm#P300_115564 |title=Registration Under the Advisers Act of Certain Hedge Fund Advisers: footnote 141  |work=Securities and exchange Commission |accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ineichen |first1=Alexander M. |year=2002 |title=Funds of Hedge Funds: Industry Overview |journal=Journal of Wealth Management |volume=47 |issue=4}}</ref>

===Side pockets===
Where a hedge fund holds assets that are hard to value reliably or are relatively illiquid (in comparison to the redemption terms of the fund itself), the fund may employ a "side pocket". A side pocket is a mechanism whereby the fund segregates the illiquid assets from the main portfolio of the fund and issues investors with a new class of interests or shares which participate only in the assets in the side pocket. Those interests/shares cannot be redeemed by the investor. Once the fund is able to sell the side pocket assets, the fund will generally redeem the side pocket interests/shares and pay investors the proceeds.

Side pockets are designed to address issues relating to the need to value investors' holdings in the fund if they choose to redeem. If an investor redeems when certain assets cannot be valued or sold, the fund cannot be confident that the calculation of his redemption proceeds would be accurate. Moreover, his redemption proceeds could only be obtained by selling the liquid assets of the fund. If the illiquid assets subsequently turned out to be worth less than expected, the remaining investors would bear the full loss while the redeemed investor would have borne none. Side pockets therefore allow a fund to ensure that all investors in the fund at the time the relevant assets became illiquid will bear any loss on them equally and allow the fund to continue subscriptions and redemptions in the meantime in respect of the main portfolio. A similar problem, inverted, applies to subscriptions during the same period.

Side pockets are most commonly used by funds as an emergency measure. They were used extensively following the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008, when the market for certain types of assets held by hedge funds collapsed, preventing the funds from selling or obtaining a market value for the assets.

Specific types of fund may also use side pockets in the ordinary course of their business. A fund investing in insurance products, for example, may routinely side pocket securities linked to natural disasters following the occurrence of such a disaster. Once the damage has been assessed, the security can again be valued with some accuracy.

===Listed funds===
Corporate hedge funds sometimes [[listing (finance)|list]] their [[share (finance)|shares]] on smaller [[stock exchange]]s, such as the [[Irish Stock Exchange]], as this provides a low level of [[regulation|regulatory]] oversight that is required by some investors. Shares in the listed hedge fund are not generally [[stock trader|traded]] on the exchange.

A fund listing is distinct from the listing or [[initial public offering]] (<U+201C>IPO<U+201D>) of shares in an [[investment management|investment manager]]. Although widely reported as a "hedge-fund IPO",<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?siteid=mktw&guid=%7B8CF79DC0-8C69-49D3-907B-153CF689B082%7D Fortress files for first U.S. hedge fund IPO], Marketwatch</ref> the IPO of [[Fortress Investment Group|Fortress Investment Group LLC]] was for the sale of the investment manager, not of the hedge funds that it managed.<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1380393/000095013606009310/file1.htm FORTRESS INVESTMENT GROUP LLC], SEC Registration Statement</ref>

==Regulation==
A range of regulatory methods are used to provide oversight of hedge funds worldwide. According to a report by the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]], the most common tactic is the direct regulation of financial advisers<U+2014>including hedge fund managers, which is primarily intended to protect investors against fraud. Specific regulations differ by national, federal and state jurisdiction. Historically, hedge funds have been exempt from certain registration and reporting requirements that apply to other investment companies, because in most jurisdictions regulation permits investments in hedge funds by only "qualified" investors who are able to make an informed decision about investment decisions without relying on regulatory oversight.<ref name=Coggan>{{cite book |title=Guide to Hedge Funds |last=Coggan |first=Philip |year=2011 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Ltd |edition=2nd}}</ref> In 2010, new regulations were passed in the U.S. and European Union, which (among other changes) introduced new hedge fund reporting requirements. The [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act]] was passed in the U.S. in July 2010, and contains provisions which require hedge fund advisers with $150 million or more in assets to register with the SEC.<ref name=Ismail/>  In November 2010, the [[European Parliament|EU Parliament]] passed the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]], which seeks to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment fund managers operating in the EU.<ref name=Regulators/>

===U.S. regulation===
Hedge funds within the U.S. are subject to various regulatory trading reporting and record keeping requirements that also apply to other investors in publicly traded securities.<ref name=Overview>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/htext/d09677t.html |title=Hedge Funds: Overview of Regulatory Oversight, Counterparty Risks, and Investment Challenges |first=Orice M. |last= Williams |date=7 May 2009 |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> Before the Dodd-Frank Act made registration mandatory for hedge fund advisers with more than US$150 million in assets under management, hedge funds were primarily regulated through their managers or advisers, under the anti-fraud provisions of the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]]. Hedge funds are privately-owned pools of investment capital with regulatory limits on the number and type of investor that each fund may have. Because of these regulatory restrictions on ownership, hedge funds have been exempt from mandatory registration with the  [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)  under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]], which is generally intended to regulate investment funds sold to retail investors.<ref name=Coggan/> The two primary exemptions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that hedge funds relied on were (a) Section 3(c)1 which restricts funds to 100 or fewer investors and (b) Section 3(c)7, which requires all investors to meet a "qualified purchaser" criterion. These sections also both prohibit hedge funds from selling their securities through public offerings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Marx Law Library, University of Cincinnati College of Law |url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoAct/sec3.html |title=The Investment Company Act of 1940 |publisher=Law.uc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sglawyers.com/hedgefundworld/forming-a-hedgefund/exemption-from-registration.aspx |title=Forming A Hedge Fund |work=SGLawyers.com |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> Under 3(c)7, a qualified purchaser is defined to include an individual with at least $5,000,000 in investment assets.

Because Sections 3(c)1 and 3(c)7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibit hedge funds from making public offerings, funds must sell their securities in accordance with the private offering rules under the [[Securities Act of 1933]]. The 1933 Act generally requires companies to file a registration statement with the SEC if they want to sell their securities publicly, or comply with [[private placement]] rules under the Act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sec.gov/about/laws.shtml#secact1933 |title=The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry: The Securities Act of 1933 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |date= |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> Though the securities of hedge funds are not registered under the 1933 Act, they remain subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Act.

Hedge funds raise capital via private placement under [[Regulation D (SEC)|Regulation D]]  of the Securities Act of 1933,  which means the shares are not registered. To comply with the private placement rules in Regulation D, hedge funds generally offer their securities solely to accredited investors. An accredited investor is an individual person with a minimum net worth of $1,000,000 or, alternatively, a minimum income of $200,000 in each of the last two years and a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year. For banks and corporate entities, the minimum net worth is $5,000,000 in invested assets.<ref name=Marx>{{cite web|author=Marx Law Library, University of Cincinnati College of Law |url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33ActRls/rule501.html |title=General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 |publisher=Law.uc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

For SEC registered hedge fund advisers to charge an incentive or performance fee, the investors in the funds must be "qualified clients" as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Rule 205<U+2013>3. To be a qualified client an individual must have $750,000 in assets invested with the adviser or a net worth in excess of $1.5 million, or be one of certain high-level employees of the investment adviser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marx Law Library, University of Cincinnati College of Law |url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvRls/rule205-3.html |title=Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 |publisher=Law.uc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is required to periodically adjust the qualified client standard for inflation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marx Law Library, University of Cincinnati College of Law |url=http://www.mmwr.com/home/publications/default.aspx?d=2889 |title=Dodd-Frank Changes to Adviser Regulation |work=Montgomery McCracken |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>

Because hedge funds do not have publicly traded securities, they are not subject to all of the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Hedge funds that have a class of equity securities owned by more than 499 investors do, however, have to register under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act and are subject the quarterly reporting requirements of the Act.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hedge funds:risk and regulation |last1=Baums |first1=Theodor |last2=Cahn |first2=Andreas |year=2004 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=3899491491 |pages=64<U+2013>65}}</ref> Similar to other institutional investors, hedge fund managers with at least $100,000,000 in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities.  Also similar to other investors, hedge fund managers are subject to public disclosure if they own more than 5% of the class of any registered equity security.<ref name=SEA1934/> Hedge fund managers are also subject to anti-fraud provisions. 

Prior to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the SEC. Advisers who do so are subject to the same requirements as all other registered investment advisers. Registered advisers must provide information about their business practices and disciplinary history to the SEC and investors. They are required to have written compliance policies and have a chief compliance officer to enforce those policies. In addition, they are required to maintain certain books and records and have their practices examined by SEC staff.<ref name=Overview>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/htext/d09677t.html |title=Hedge Funds: Overview of Regulatory Oversight, Counterparty Risks, and Investment Challenges |first=Orice M. |last= Williams |date=7 May 2009 |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> As a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, hedge fund advisers with at least $150,000,000 in assets under management will be required to register with the SEC as of July 21, 2011, while smaller advisers will be subject to state registration.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite web |url=http://www.regulatorycompliance.com/newsletter/2010/April/financial_regulatory_reform.html |title=Financial Regulatory Reform <U+2013> What Does it Mean for You? |last1=Chalmers |first1=Geoffrey T. |date=April 2010 |work=RegulatoryCompliance.com |publisher=Regulatory Compliance, LLC |accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref>

In December 2004, the SEC issued a rule change that required most hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC by February 1, 2006, as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2333.htm |title=Registration Under the Advisers Act of Certain Hedge Fund Advisers |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=7 December 2004 |work=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |publisher= |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> The requirement, with minor exceptions, applied to firms managing in excess of $25,000,000 with over 14 investors.

Many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]. Hedge fund advisers registered as [[Commodity Pool Operator]]s (CPO) or [[Commodity Trading Advisor]]s (CTA)  would fall within this category, as would any manager of a hedge fund investing in markets under the CFTC<U+2019>s jurisdiction, even if they qualify for an exemption from CPO or CTA registration. Hedge fund managers who meet these criteria are subject to rules and provisions of the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] prohibiting fraud and manipulation.<ref name=Brown-Hruska>{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/opa/speeches04/opabrown-hruska-22.htm |title=Securities Industry Association Hedge Funds Conference |first= Sharon |last=Brown-Hruska |day=30 |month=November |year=2004 |work=Securities Industry Association Hedge Funds Conference Keynote Address|publisher=U.S Commodity Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>

====Comparison with other funds====
The regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds and mutual funds differ in three major ways. First, mutual funds are required to be registered with and regulated by the SEC, while hedge funds historically have not. Investors in hedge funds must be [[accredited investor]]s, with certain exceptions (employees, etc.), and cannot be marketed to retail investors; mutual funds, however, do not have this restriction. Finally, mutual funds must be liquid on a daily basis. If a mutual fund investor wishes to redeem his or her investment the fund must be able to meet that request immediately.  Hedge funds ordinarily do not have daily liquidity, but rather "lock up" periods of time where the total returns are generated (net of fees) for their investors and then returned when the term ends.

Mutual funds must also determine the [[net asset value]] (NAV) of the fund. While some hedge funds that are based offshore report their NAV to the ''Financial Times'', for the most part there is no method of ascertaining pricing on a regular basis. In addition, mutual funds must have a prospectus available to anyone who requests one (either electronically or via U.S. postal mail), and must disclose their asset allocation quarterly, whereas hedge funds do not have to abide by these terms.

All investment funds are subject to regulations that prohibit charging fees to investors, unless the investment performance of the fund is equivalent to that of an index or other measure of performance. This regulation is set out under Section 205(b) of the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]], which limits performance fees to so-called "fulcrum fees". Due to this regulation, hedge funds charging a performance fee are unique compared with other funds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marx Law Library, University of Cincinnati College of Law |url=http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/sec205.html |title=The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 |publisher=Law.uc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

====Dodd-Frank====
The [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act]] was passed in the U.S. in July 2010, aiming to increase regulation of financial companies, including hedge funds.<ref name=Chay>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20101129-249737.html |title=Call For Joint Effort to Protect Hedge Fund Business |first= Felda |last=Chay |day=27 |month=November |year=2010 |work=The Business Times Singapore |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=Ismail/> The act requires advisers to private pools of capital of $150 million or more in assets to register with the SEC as investment advisers and become subject to all the rules that apply to registered advisers by July 21, 2011. Previous exemptions from registration provided under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 will no longer apply to most hedge fund advisers.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite web |url=http://www.regulatorycompliance.com/newsletter/2010/April/financial_regulatory_reform.html |title=Financial Regulatory Reform <U+2013> What Does it Mean for You? |last1=Chalmers |first1=Geoffrey T. |date=April 2010 |work=RegulatoryCompliance.com |publisher=Regulatory Compliance, LLC |accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref> Under Dodd-Frank, hedge fund managers who have less than $100 million in assets under management will be overseen by the state where the manager is domiciled and become subject to state regulation.<ref name=Chalmers/> This will significantly increase the number of hedge funds under state supervision, as the threshold for SEC regulation was previously $30 million.<ref name=Brief_Summary/> In addition to U.S. hedge funds, many overseas funds with more than 15 U.S. clients and investors, and managing more than $25 million for these clients, will also have to register with the SEC by July 21, 2011.<ref name=Ismail>{{cite web |http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/asia-s-cash-starved-small-hedge-funds-face-tsunami-of-u-s-registration.html |title=Asia<U+2019>s Cash-Poor Small Hedge Funds |first= Netty |last=Ismail |date=23 February 2011 |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> Mandatory registration of hedge fund advisers was supported by the largest hedge fund trade group, the Managed Funds Association (MFA), which announced its support for registration in testimony to a U.S. congressional committee on May 7, 2009.<ref name="Regulatory Update">{{cite web |http://www.whitecase.com/investmentfunds_regulatory_update_05142009/ |title=Investment Funds Regulatory Update |date=14 May 2009 |work=White & Case Newsletter |publisher=White & Case LLP |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>

Additionally, Dodd-Frank requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to help regulators fulfill their obligation to monitor and regulate systemic risk. The aim is for this data to be analyzed and shared among regulators <U+2013> including the newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council <U+2013> and for the SEC to report to Congress on how the data is being used to protect both investors and market integrity.<ref name="Brief_Summary">{{cite web |http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=7&ved=0CEUQFjAG&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbanking.senate.gov%2Fpublic%2F_files%2F070110_Dodd_Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_comprehensive_summary_Final.pdf&rct=j&q=dodd%20frank%20regulation%20hedge%20fund&ei=azpwTaqfHJT6sAPAz7m2Cw&usg=AFQjCNE8970z3jYt7WIxTVqwbBDT7hSYFg&sig2=El9aKocS0NI1ITidhvCvdg&cad=rja    |title=Brief Summary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act |format=PDF |work=banking.senate.gov |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=8 March, 2008}}</ref> Under the so-called "Volcker Rule", regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks, their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and also to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading, and limit their investment in, and sponsorship of hedge funds.<ref name="Brief_Summary"/>

===European regulation===
Within the [[European Union]] (EU), as with the U.S., hedge funds are primarily regulated through advisers who manage the funds.<ref name=Coggan/> In the [[United Kingdom]], which is the hedge fund center of the EU, hedge fund advisers are required to be authorized and regulated by the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA), the national regulator.<ref name=Regulators>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/25/us-finance-summit-reforms-idUSTRE71O41P20110225?pageNumber=1 |title=Regulators Crack Down on Banks, Markets |date=25 February 2011 |work=Reuters |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> Historically, there have been different regulatory approaches within each country in the EU. In some countries there are specific restrictions on hedge fund activities, including controls on use of derivatives in [[Portugal]], and limits on leverage in [[France]].<ref name=Coggan/>

In 2010, the EU approved a law to require hedge funds to register with national regulatory authorities. The [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive|EU's Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers]] (AIFMD) was passed by the [[European Parliament|EU Parliament]] on November 11, 2010 and is the first EU directive focused on "alternative investment fund managers", including hedge fund managers.<ref name=Regulators/> According to the EU, the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds.<ref>{{cite web |http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/572&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en

The directive also introduces a rule that hedge fund managers should hold larger amounts of capital. All hedge fund managers within the EU will also be subject to potential limitations on the amount of leverage they can use.<ref name=Chay/> Since AIFMD covers the entire EU, and individual countries have different rules for hedge fund marketing, the directive introduced a "passport" for hedge funds authorized in one EU country to operate throughout the EU.<ref name=Regulators/><ref name=Chay/> The scope of the AIFMD is broad and encompasses managers located within the EU as well as non-EU managers that market their funds to European investors. Countries within the EU are required to adopt the directive in national legislation by early 2013.<ref name=Chay/>

===Offshore and other locations===
[[Offshore Financial Centre|Offshore centers]] offer business-friendly regulation, which has encouraged the establishment of hedge funds. Major centers include [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dublin]], [[Luxembourg]], [[British Virgin Islands]], and [[Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite news |title=TalkingPoint: Outlook For Offshore-registered Hedge Funds In 2011
|first= |last= |url=http://www.financierworldwide.com/article_printable.php?id=7809 |work=Financier Worldwide |date=February 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref> Hedge funds have to file accounts and conduct their business in compliance with the requirements of these offshore centers. Typical rules concern restrictions on the availability of funds to retail investors (Dublin), protection of client confidentiality (Luxembourg) and the requirement for the fund to be independent of the fund manager.

In [[Asia]], [[Singapore]] offers fewer licensing requirements and regulations for hedge funds than [[Hong Kong]] and other financial capitals in the region.<ref name=Ismail/> Singapore<U+2019>s oversight of hedge funds will increase following the introduction of new rules and regulations in 2011,<ref name=Regulators/> but small funds will be able to continue operating without a license. Hedge funds based in Hong Kong are subject to the same licensing requirements as mutual funds.<ref name=Ismail/>

Many international hedge fund markets are affected by regulation passed in 2010 within the United States and European Union. Under the EU<U+2019>s Alternative Investment Fund Managers directive, offshore hedge funds using prime brokers as depositaries will be required to use EU-registered credit institutions before they can be sold in the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ftadviser.com/InvestmentAdviser/Investments/News/article/20110228/cf8bd858-3de0-11e0-9432-00144f2af8e8/Offshores-could-struggle-under-directive-says-Collins-Meader.jsp |title=Offshores Could Struggle Under Directive, Says Collins<U+2019> Meader |day=28 |month=February |year=2011 |work=Investment Adviser |publisher=Financial Times Group |accessdate=8 March, 2008}}</ref> The AIFMD<U+2019>s regulatory requirements will essentially mandate equivalent regulations for non-EU investment funds, if they wish to operate in EU markets.<ref name=Regulators/>

The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in the U.S. in 2010, will have several key implications for overseas hedge funds. Funds with more than 15 U.S. clients and investors managing $25 million or more will have to register with the SEC by July 21, 2011. Registered managers must file and maintain information including the assets under management and trading positions. Prior to the Dodd-Frank act, some Asian hedge funds had registered with the SEC.<ref name=Ismail>{{cite web |http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/asia-s-cash-starved-small-hedge-funds-face-tsunami-of-u-s-registration.html |title=Asia<U+2019>s Cash-Poor Small Hedge Funds |first= Netty |last=Ismail |day=23 |month=February |year=2011 |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref>

==Hedge fund indices==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
There are many indices that track the hedge fund industry, and these fall into three main categories.  In their historical order of development they are Non-investable, Investable and Clone.

In traditional equity investment, indices play a central and unambiguous role. They are widely accepted as representative, and products such as futures and ETFs provide investable access to them in most developed markets. However hedge funds are illiquid, heterogeneous and ephemeral, which makes it hard to construct a satisfactory  index. Non-investable indices are representative, but, due to various biases, their quoted returns may not be available in practice. Investable indices achieve liquidity at the expense of limited representativeness. Clone indices seek to replicate some statistical properties of hedge funds but are not directly based on them.  None of these approaches is wholly satisfactory.

===Non-investable indices===
Non-investable indices are indicative in nature, and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database. The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds. This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.

Although they aim to be representative, non-investable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of [[Selection bias|biases]].

Funds<U+2019> participation in a database is voluntary, leading to [[self-selection bias]] because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole. For example, some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money.

The short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year, which raises the problem of [[Attrition bias|survivorship bias]]. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.

When a fund is added to a database for the first time, all or part of its historical data is recorded ex-post in the database. It is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable, so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated. This is known as "instant history bias<U+201D> or <U+201C>backfill bias<U+201D>.

===Investable indices===
Investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders. To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index.  When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.

To make the index investable, hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor.  To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable.  This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds, and most seriously they may under-represent more successful managers.

===Hedge fund replication===
The most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner.  Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns, and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets.  This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets.  This makes the index investable, and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed.

However, they rely on a statistical modelling process.  As replication indices have a relatively short history it is not yet possible to know how reliable this process will be in practice, although initially indications are that much of hedge fund returns can be replicated in this manner without the problems of illiquidity, transparency and fraud that exist in direct hedge fund investments.

==Debates and controversies==
===Systemic risk===
[[Systemic risk]] refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system, as opposed to within a single company. Such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity.<ref name=NBER>{{cite web |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w11200 |title=Systemic Risk and Hedge Funds  |last1=Chan |first1=Nicholas |last2=Getmansky |first2=Mila  |last3=Haas |first3=Shane M |last3=Lo |first3=Andrew W |date=March 2005 |work=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Organizations such as the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]<ref name=NBER/> and the [[European Central Bank]] have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/financialstabilityreview200606en.pdf |title=Financial Stability Review June 2006 |format=PDF |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article670960.ece |title=ECB warns on hedge fund risk|author=[[Gary Duncan]]|publisher=The Times|date=2006-06-02|accessdate=2007-05-01 | location=London}}</ref>, and following the failure of hedge fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) in 1998 there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure lead to the failure of its counterparties even though no financial assistance was provided to LTCM by the U.S. Federal Reserve, incurring no cost for U.S. taxpayers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bookstaber |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1653556,00.html |title=Blowing up the Lab on Wall Street |publisher=Time.com |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

In October 2009, April 2010, and September 2010, the FSA surveyed 50 hedge fund managers regarding the sector's risks, leverage levels and [[Counterparty#Financial_services_sector|counterparties]]. Based on information collected in the 2009 and 2010 surveys, the FSA published reports that affirmed that the European hedge fund industry posed no systemic risk to the financial system. The FSA determined that, based on indicators of risk, there was "no clear evidence to suggest that... any individual fund posed a significant systemic risk to the financial system."<ref name=Armitstead>{{cite news |title=Hedge funds do not pose systemic risk, concludes FSA |first=Louise |last=Armitstead |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/ditch-the-directive/7300888/Hedge-funds-do-not-pose-systemic-risk-concludes-FSA.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> In particular, the reports noted that hedge funds have a relatively small "footprint" of securities compared to equity raised from investors, indicating that use of leverage was reasonable.<ref name=FSA2011>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/other/hf_survey.pdf

===Transparency===
As private, lightly regulated entities, hedge funds are not obliged to disclose their activities to third parties. This is in contrast to a regulated [[mutual fund]] (or unit trust), which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment advisor of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors. <ref>Carrie Johnson, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html "Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds"] ''The Washington Post'' (June 29, 2006). Retrieved March 1, 2011</ref>

Funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors. Much of the data available in consolidated databases is self-reported and unverified.<ref>Cassar, G., & Gerakos, J. (2009). Determinants of Hedge Fund Internal Controls and Fees. Retrieved from [http://www.hbs.edu/units/am/pdf/Gerakos.pdf]</ref>  A study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data. The study noted that 465 common funds had significant differences in reported information (e.g. returns, inception date, net assets value, incentive fee, management fee, investment styles, etc.) and that 5% of return numbers and 5% of NAV numbers were dramatically different.<ref>Liang, B. (2000). Hedge Funds: The Living and the Dead. Journal of Financial & Quantitative Analysis, 35(3), 309<U+2013>326.

Some hedge funds, mainly American, do not use third parties either as the [[custodian bank|custodian]] of their assets or as their administrator (who will calculate the [[Net asset value|NAV]] of the fund). This can lead to conflicts of interest, and in extreme cases can assist fraud. In a recent example, Kirk Wright of International Management Associates has been accused of mail fraud and other securities violations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19581.htm |title=SEC v.

In December 2008, [[Bernard Madoff]] was arrested for running a $50 billion [[Ponzi scheme]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5331997.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Wall Street legend Bernard Madoff arrested over 50 billion Ponzi scheme | date=December 12, 2008 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>  While Madoff did not run a hedge fund, several feeder funds, of which the largest was [[Fairfield Greenwich Group#Fairfield Sentry Fund|Fairfield Sentry]], channelled money to Madoff.

===Market capacity===
[[Alpha (investment)|Alpha]] appears to have been becoming rarer for two related reasons. First, the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance. Second, the remuneration model is attracting more managers, which may dilute the talent available in the industry, though these causes are disputed.<ref>G<U+00E9>hin and Vaissi<U+00E9>, 2006, ''The Right Place for Alternative Betas in Hedge Fund Performance: an Answer to the Capacity Effect Fantasy'', The Journal of Alternative Investments, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 9<U+2013>18</ref>

===U.S. investigations===
In June 2006, prompted by a letter from [[Gary J. Aguirre]], the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts. Aguirre was fired from his job with the SEC when, as lead investigator of [[insider trading]] allegations against [[Pequot Capital Management]], he tried to interview [[John Mack]], then being considered for [[chief executive officer]] at [[Morgan Stanley]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html |title=Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= June 29, 2006|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> The Judiciary Committee and the [[U.S. Senate Finance Committee]] issued a scathing report in 2007, which found that Aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal<ref>Liz Noyer, [http://blogs.forbes.com/streettalk/2010/05/27/scales-of-justice-look-skewed-for-rajaratnam-samberg/ "Scales Of Justice Look Skewed For Rajaratnam, Samberg"] ''Forbes'' magazine (May 27, 2010).

===Performance measurement===
Performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain, as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly. However, summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals<ref>{{cite web|last=Willoughby |first=Jack |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB119101983536943198.html?mod=b_hps_9_0001_b_this_weeks_magazine_home_top |title=High Performance <U+2013> Barron's Online |publisher=Online.barrons.com |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/BA_HedgeFund50_071001.pdf | work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> and databases.<ref name=Or>{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110304-711526.html |title=Hedge Fund Assets Near $2.5 Trillion in 2010 |first=Amy |last=Or |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc. |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> and investment consultancy Hennessee Group.<ref name="Lost Decade"/>

===Value in mean/variance efficient portfolios===
According to [[Modern Portfolio Theory]], rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are mean/variance efficient (that is, portfolios offer the highest level of return per unit of risk, and the lowest level of risk per unit of return). One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular [[market neutral]] and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.<ref name="Roadmap"/>

However, there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds. These reasons are:
# Hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks;
# Hedge funds<U+2019> low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events, making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear; and
# Hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged.

Several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman<ref><U+2019><U+2019>Portfolio Efficiency with Performance Fees<U+2019><U+2019>, Economics and Political Strategy (newsletter), February 2007, Peter L. Bernstein Inc.</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html? Hulbert, Mark <U+2018><U+2019>2 + 20, and Other Hedge Fund Math<U+2019><U+2019>, ''New York Times'', March 4, 2007.]</ref> who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.

The other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to under-perform during equity bear markets, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value.<ref name="Roadmap"/> For example, in January<U+2013>September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |title=Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Index web page |publisher=Hedgeindex.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> was down 9.87%. According to the same index series, even "dedicated short bias" funds had a return of <U+2212>6.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008.

Hedge funds posted disappointing returns in 2008, but the average hedge fund return of <U+2212>18.65% (the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index return) was far better than the returns generated by most assets other than cash. The S&P 500 total return was <U+2212>37.00% in 2008, and that was one of the best performing equity indices in the world. Several equity markets lost more than half their value. Most foreign and domestic corporate debt indices also suffered in 2008, posting losses significantly worse than the average hedge fund. Mutual funds also performed much worse than hedge funds in 2008. According to Lipper, the average U.S. domestic equity mutual fund decreased 37.6% in 2008. The average international equity mutual fund declined 45.8%. The average sector mutual fund dropped 39.7%. The average China mutual fund declined 52.7% and the average Latin America mutual fund plummeted 57.3%. Real estate, both residential and commercial, also suffered significant drops in 2008. In summary, hedge funds outperformed many similarly-risky investment options in 2008.
