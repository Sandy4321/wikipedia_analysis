'''Premier Padmini''' was an automobile manufactured in India from 1964 to 2000, although the "Padmini" name was not used until 1967 - the earlier cars were sold as the "Fiat 1100 Delight". The car is popularly called "Fiat". [[Premier Automobiles Limited]], the erstwhile flagship company of India's Walchand Hirachand Group, assembled [[Fiat]]'s [[Fiat 1100|1100-series]] cars from the 1950s until 1997. Within the very limited Indian market, and especially in comparison with its main competitor the [[Hindustan Ambassador]], the Padmini was considered quite sporting.

==History==
The Fiat 1100D, based on the Fiat 1200 GranLuce Berlina debuted in India in 1964 with a carburetted 1,089&nbsp;cc four-cylinder engine rather than the 1,221&nbsp;cc engine fitted to the GranLuce in Italy. With a 7.8:1 compression ratio, it put out {{convert|40|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800&nbsp;rpm with a maximum [[torque]] of {{convert|7.20|kgm|Nm lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,000&nbsp;rpm. The original transmission was a four-speed manual gearbox, with an un-synchronized first, that drove the rear wheels through a live axle. It had a column-mounted shifter, on the left-hand side of the steering column. Weighing {{convert|895|kg|lb|abbr=on}} the car could attain a top speed of {{convert|115|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}.

Premier manufactured it at their [[Kurla]], [[Mumbai]] plant until they sold a majority stake to Fiat SpA in September 1997. First sold as the Fiat 1100 Delight, the 1100D was preceded in the Indian market by the [[Fiat 1100#Fiat 1100-103|Fiat 1100-103]]. It was also briefly sold as the Premier President (only for the 1973 model year) until it finally settled down as the Premier Padmini.

By the mid-eighties, a more powerful version which offered {{convert|44|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm was also available. Claimed top speed increased to {{convert|119|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name="AR87"/> The Padmini was only available with petrol engines until 1996, when they introduced a diesel varient.<ref name="Car History 4U">{{cite web| title = History of Premier Automobiles | url = http://www.carhistory4u.com/the-last-100-years/car-manufacturers-by-country/india/premier-automobiles | publisher = Form and Function | work = Car History 4 U }}</ref>

Numerous examples still abound as [[taxicab]]s in Mumbai. Many of these taxis now run on [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]] for fuel economy. While all cars built by Premier themselves were four-door sedans, small companies also offered other bodywork, mainly in the form of estates.<ref name="AR87"/> The Fiat 1100-D's original design remained unchanged, aside from some minor grill facelifts in the eighties and the removal of the front-door vent windows at some point in the early nineties.

Along with the [[Hindustan Ambassador]], the Padmini harks back to the socialist India of pre-liberalization, before the [[Economic reforms in India|reforms program]] of 1991. Classic Car Clubs have since been started by Fiat enthusiasts.
