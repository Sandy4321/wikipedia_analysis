=== Name ===
{{Main|Getae#Getae and Dacians}}
The Dacians were known as ''Geta'' (plural ''Getae'') in [[Ancient Greek]] writings, and as ''Dacus'' (plural ''Daci'') or ''Getae'' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] documents,{{sfn|Appian|165 AD|loc=Praef. 4/14-15|ps=, quoted in {{sfn|Millar|2004|p=189|ps=: "the Getae over the Danube, whom they call Dacians"}}}} but also as ''Dagae'' and ''Gaete'' as depicted on the late Roman map ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''. It was [[Herodotus]] who first used the [[ethnonym]] ''Getae'' in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}} In Greek and Latin, in the writings of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Strabo]], and [[Pliny the Elder]], the people became known as <U+2018>the Dacians<U+2019>.{{sfn|Fol|1996|p=223}} Getae and Dacians were interchangeable terms, or used with some confusion by the Greeks.{{sfn|Nandris|1976|p=730|ps=: Strabo and [[Trogus Pompeius]] "Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt"}}{{sfn|Crossland|Boardman|1982|p=837}} Latin poets often used the name ''Getae''.{{sfn|Roesler|1864|p=89}} [[Virgilius]] called them ''Getae'' four times, and ''Daci'' once, [[Lucian]] ''Getae'' three times and ''Daci'' twice, [[Horace]] named them ''Getae'' twice and ''Daci'' five times, while [[Juvenal]] one time ''Getae'' and two times ''Daci''.{{sfn|Zumpt|Zumpt|1852|pp=140 & 175}}{{sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170}}{{sfn|Roesler|1864|p=89}} In AD 113, [[Hadrian]] used the poetic term ''Getae'' for the Dacians.{{sfn|Everitt|2010|p=151}} Modern historians prefer to use the name ''Geto-Dacians''.{{sfn|Fol|1996|p=223}} [[Strabo]] describes the Getae and Dacians as distinct but cognate tribes, but also states that they spoke the same language.{{sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=150}} This distinction refers to the regions they occupied.{{sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=150}} Strabo and Pliny the Elder also state that Getae and Dacians spoke the same language.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=44}}

By contrast, the name of ''Dacians'', whatever the origin of the name, was used by the more western tribes who adjoined the [[Pannonians]] and therefore first became known to the Romans.{{sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=151}} According to Strabo's ''[[Geographica]]'', the original name of the Dacians was {{lang|grc|''<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BF><U+03B9>''}} "''Daoi''".{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12}}{{sfn|Riley|2007|p=107}} The name Daoi (one of the ancient Geto-Dacian tribes) was certainly adopted by foreign observers to designate all the inhabitants of the countries north of [[Danube]] that had not yet been conquered by [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] or Rome.{{sfn|Fol|1996|p=223}}{{sfn|Fol|1996|p=223}}

The ethnographic name ''Daci'' is found under various forms within ancient sources. Greeks used the forms {{lang|grc|<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9>}} "''Dakoi''" ([[Strabo]], [[Dio Cassius]], and [[Dioscorides]]) and {{lang|grc|<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BF><U+03B9>}} "Daoi" (singular Daos).<ref name="Gara<U+0161>anin, Benac 1973 243">Gara<U+0161>anin, Benac (1973) 243</ref>{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12}}{{sfn|Parvan|Vulpe|Vulpe|2002|p=158}}<ref>Dioscorides<U+2019>s book (known in English by its Latin title ''De Materia Medica'' <U+2018>Regarding Medical Materials<U+2019>) has all the Dacian names of the plants preceded by {{lang|grc|<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9>}} ''Dakoi'' i.e. {{lang|grc|<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9>}} ''Dakoi'' <U+03C0><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B1> Latin Daci [[wikt:propodila|propodila]] "Dacians propodila"</ref><ref name="Tomaschek (1883) 397 ">Tomaschek (1883) 397</ref>{{sfn|Riley|2007|p=107}} The form {{lang|grc|''<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03BF><U+03B9>''}} "Daoi" was frequently used according to [[Stephan of Byzantium]].{{sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170}}
Latins used the forms ''Davus'', ''Dacus'', and a derived form ''Dacisci'' (Vopiscus and inscriptions).<ref>Mulvin (2002)59 "...A tombstone inscription from Aquincum reads M. Secundi Genalis domo Cl. Agrip /pina/ negotiat. Dacisco.

=== Etymology ===
The name ''Daci'', or "Dacians" is a collective [[ethnonym]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Dacia: Land of Transylvania, Cornerstone of Ancient Eastern Europe}}</ref> Dio Cassius reported that the Dacians themselves used that name, and the Romans so called them, while the Greeks called them Getae.{{sfn| Sidebottom |2007|p = 6}}{{sfn|Florov|2001|p = 66}}{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p = 434}} Opinions on the origins of the name ''Daci'' are divided. Some scholars consider it to originate in the Indo-European *''dha-k''-, with the stem *''dhe''- "to put, to place", while others think that the name ''Daci'' originates in *daca <U+2014> "knife, dagger" or in a word similar to daos, meaning "wolf" in the related language of the [[Phrygians]].{{sfn| Barbulescu| Nagler |2005|p=68}}

One hypothesis is that the name ''Getae'' originates in the Indo-European *guet- 'to utter, to talk'.{{sfn|Vraciu|1980|p=45}}{{sfn| Barbulescu| Nagler |2005|p=68}} Another hypothesis is that "Getae" and "Daci" are Iranian names of two Iranian-speaking [[Scythian]] groups that had been assimilated into the larger Thracian-speaking population of the later "Dacia".{{sfn|Lemny|Iorga|1984|p=210}}{{sfn| Toynbee |1961|p=435}}

==== Early history of etymological approaches ====
In the 1st century AD, Strabo suggested that its stem formed a name previously borne by slaves: Greek Daos, Latin Davus (-k- is a known suffix in Indo-European ethnic names).{{sfn| Crossland|Boardman|1982|p=8375}} In the 18th century, Grimm proposed the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''dags'' or "day" that would give the meaning of "light, brilliant". Yet, ''dags'' belongs to the Sanskrit word-root ''dah-'' and a derivation from ''Dah'' to {{lang|grc|<U+0394><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>}} "Daci", is difficult.{{sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170}} In the 19th century, Tomaschek (1883) proposed the form "Dak", meaning ''those who understand and can speak'', by considering "Dak" as a derivation of the root ''da''("k" being a suffix) cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''dasa'', Bactrian ''daonha''.<ref name="Tomaschek (1883) 404 ">Tomaschek (1883) 404</ref> Tomaschek also proposed the form "Davus", meaning "members of the clan/countryman" cf. [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] ''daqyu'', ''danhu'' "canton".<ref name="Tomaschek (1883) 404 "/>

==== Modern times ====
In the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], where *dhe-, 'to set, place' from where dheua > dava 'settlement' and Dhe-k > Daci 'Dacian' is supported by Russu (1967).{{sfn|Russu |1967|p=133}} "Daos" was suggested in 1957 by Decev as a possible connection with the [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] ''daos'', meaning "wolf".{{sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77}} The Phrygian meaning is supported by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]'s notes.{{sfn|Eisler|1951|p=136}}{{sfn|Parvan|Vulpe|Vulpe|2002|p=149}} This hypothesis has had a large diffusion due to historian [[Mircea Eliade]].{{sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77}} The identification or connection with wolves is not unique to Dacians but also present for other ancient [[Indo-European]] tribes, including the [[Luvians]], [[Lycians]], [[Lucanians]], [[Hyrcanians]], and [[Dahae]].{{sfn|Eisler|1951|p=33}}{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=12}} The assumption of Daoi (wolf) may also be supported by one of the Dacian standards, the [[Dacian Draco]], prominently featuring a wolf head. ''Phrygii'' was another name used within the region, and in later times, some [[Roman auxiliaries]] recruited from the area were referred to as [[Phrygi]]. The German linguist [[Paul Kretschmer]] explained "daos" with the root ''dhau'', meaning to press, to gather, or to strangle (as wolves often use a neck bite to kill their prey).{{sfn|Alecu-C<U+0103>lu<U+0219>i<U+021B><U+0103>|1992|p=19}} According to Romanian historian and archaeologist Alexandru Vulpe, the Dacian etymology explained by ''daos'' (wolf) has little plausibility, as the draco was not unique to Dacians, while the transformation of ''daos'' into ''dakos'' is phonetically improbable. He thus dismisses it as [[folk etymology]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vulpe |first1=Alexandru |editor= [[Romanian Academy]] |title=Istoria Rom<U+00E2>nilor |volume=1|year= 2001|publisher=[[Univers Enciclopedic]] |location=Bucharest |language=Romanian |isbn=973-45-0381-2|pages=420<U+2013>421 |chapter=Dacia <U+00EE>nainte de romani}}</ref> The form "Daus" or "Davus" could be also compared to a similar ethnonym in Old Persian "Daos" and to a Phrygian deity also called "Daos".{{sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77}}

=== Mythological theories ===
[[File:Dacian Draco on Trajan's Column 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dacian Draco as from Trajan's Column]]

Mircea Eliade attempted, in his book ''From [[Zalmoxis]] to [[Genghis Khan]]'', to give a mythological foundation to an alleged special relation between Dacians and the wolves:{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=11}}
* Dacians might have called themselves "wolves" or "ones the same with wolves",{{sfn|Eisler|1951|p=137}}{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=11}} suggesting religious significance.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=13}}
* Dacians draw their name from a god or a legendary ancestor who appeared as a wolf.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=13}}
* Dacians had taken their name from a group of fugitive immigrants arrived from other regions or from their own young outlaws, who acted similarly to the wolves circling villages and living from looting. As was the case in other societies, those young members of the community went through an initiation, perhaps up to a year, during which they lived as a "wolf".{{sfn|Jeanmaire|1975|p=540}}{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=13}} Comparatively, [[Hittites|Hittite]] laws referred to fugitive outlaws as "wolves".{{sfn|Eisler|1951|p=144}}
* The existence of a ritual that provides one with the ability to turn into a wolf.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=15}} Such a transformation may be related either to [[lycanthropy]] itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the [[Balkans]]-[[Carpathian]] region,{{sfn|Eisler|1951|p=144}} or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=15}} Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or [[M<U+00E4>nnerb<U+00FC>nde]]).{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=15}} To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=13}} Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the [[Neolithic]] period, including the [[Vin<U+010D>a culture]] artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask.{{sfn|Zambotti|1954|loc=p. 184, fig. 13-14, 16}}{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=23}} The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies in which young people put on their seasonal wolf masks.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=23}} The element of unity of beliefs about [[werewolves]] and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by whatever means used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a primary event.{{sfn|Eliade|1995|p=27}}{{sfn|Eliade|1986}}

==Origins and ethnogenesis==
{{See also|Prehistoric Balkans#Iron Age}}
Evidence of proto-Thracians or proto-Dacians in the prehistoric period depends on the remains of [[material culture]]. It is generally proposed{{by whom|date = January 2014}} that a proto-Dacian or proto-Thracian{{clarify|date = January 2014}} people developed from a mixture of [[Neolithic Europe|indigenous peoples]] and [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]]{{clarify|date = January 2014}} from the time of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] expansion in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3,300<U+2013>3,000 BC)<ref>Hoddinott, p. 27.</ref> when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples.<ref>Casson, p. 3.</ref> The indigenous people were Danubian farmers, and the invading people of the BC 3rd millennium were Kurgan warrior-herders from the Ukrainian and Russian steppes.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=58}}

Indo-Europeanization was complete by the beginning of the Bronze Age. The people of that time are best described as proto-Thracians, which later developed in the Iron Age into Danubian-Carpathian Geto-Dacians as well as Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=53}}

Between BC 15th<U+2013>12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors who were on their way through the Balkans to Anatolia.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}} When the La Tene Celts arrived in BC 4th century, the Dacians were under the influence of the Scythians.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

[[Alexander the Great]] attacked the Getae in BC 335 on the lower Danube, but by BC 300 they had formed a state founded on a military democracy, and began a period of conquest.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}} More Celts arrived during the BC 3rd century, and in BC 1st century the people of Boii tried to conquer some of the Dacian territory on the eastern side of the Teiss river. The Dacians drove the Boii south across the Danube and out of their territory, at which point the Boii abandoned any further plans for invasion.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

==Identity and distribution==
{{POV-section|date = November 2013}}
North of the Danube, Dacians occupied{{when|date = October 2013}} a larger territory than Ptolemaic Dacia,{{Clarify|need to explain exactly what Ptolemaic Dacia is - the area shown as Dacian in Ptolemy's maps? They aren't mentioned until later in the article|date=July 2012}} stretching between Bohemia in the west and the [[Dnieper]] [[waterfall|cataracts]] in the east, and up to the [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]], [[Vistula]], and [[Oder]] rivers in the north and northwest.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=279}}{{better source|date = October 2013}} In BC 53, [[Julius Caesar]] stated that the Dacian territory{{clarify|date = November 2013}} was on the eastern border of the [[Hercynian forest]].{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}} According to Strabo's ''[[Geographica]]'', written around AD 20,{{sfn|Strabo|Jones|Sterrett|1967|p=28}} the Getes (Geto-Dacians) bordered the [[Suevi]] who lived in the [[Hercynian Forest]], which is somewhere in the vicinity of the river Duria, the present-day Vah (Waag).{{sfn|Abramea|1994|p=17}} Dacians lived on both sides of the Danube.{{sfn|Dio|2008|loc=Volume 3}} {{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=67}} According to [[Strabo]], Moesians also lived on both sides of the Danube.{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=434}} According to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]],{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=221|ps=Agrippa comments <U+201C>Dacia, Getico finiuntur ab oriente desertis Sarmatiae, ab occidente flumine Vistula, a septentrione Oceano, a meridie flumine Histro.

===Linguistic affiliation===
{{Main|Dacian language}}
{{See also|Davae|List of Dacian towns}}

The Dacians and Getae were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, [[Appian]], Strabo and Pliny the Elder), and were both said to speak the same Thracian language.{{sfn|Treptow |1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Ellis|1861|p=70}} The linguistic affiliation of Dacian is uncertain, since the ancient [[Indo-European]] language in question became extinct and left very limited traces, usually in the form of place names, plant names and personal names. Thraco-Dacian (or Thracian and Daco-Mysian){{which|date=November 2013}} seems to belong to the eastern (satem) group of Indo-European languages.{{why|date=November 2013}}{{sfn|Brixhe|2008|p=72}} There are two contradictory theories: Some scholars (such as Tomaschek 1883; Russu 1967; Solta 1980; Crossland 1982; Vraciu 1980) consider Dacian to be a Thracian language or a dialect thereof. This view is supported by R. G. Solta, who says that Thracian and Dacian are very closely related languages.{{sfn | Fisher | 2003 | p=570}}{{sfn|Rosetti |1982|p=5}} Other scholars (such as Georgiev 1965, Duridanov 1976) consider that Thracian and Dacian are two different and specific Indo-European languages which cannot be reduced to a common language.{{sfn|Duridanov|1985|p=130}} Linguists such as [[Edgar Charles Polom<U+00E9>|Polom<U+00E9>]] and Kati<U+010D>i<U+0107> expressed reservations{{clarify|date=November 2013}} about both theories.{{sfn|Polom<U+00E9>|1982|p=876}}

The Dacians are generally considered{{by whom|date=November 2013}} to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity{{specify|date=November 2013}} from earlier Iron Age communities loosely termed{{by whom|date=November 2013}} Getic.{{sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=215}} Since in one interpretation, Dacian is a variety of Thracian, for the reasons of convenience, the generic term <U+2018>Daco-Thracian<U+201D> is used, with "Dacian" reserved for the language or dialect that was spoken north of Danube, in present-day Romania and eastern Hungary, and "Thracian" for the variety spoken south of the Danube. {{sfn|Price|2000|p=120}} There is no doubt that the Thracian language was related to the Dacian language which was spoken in what is today Romania, before that area was occupied by the Romans.{{sfn|Renfrew|1990|p=71}} Also, both Thracian and Dacian have one of the main satem characteristic changes of Indo-European language, *k and *g to *s and *z.{{sfn | Hainsworth| 1982 | p=848}} With regard to the term "Getic" (Getae), even though attempts have been made to distinguish between Dacian and Getic, there seems no compelling reason to disregard the view of the Greek geographer Strabo that the Daci and the Getae, Thracian tribes dwelling north of the Danube (the Daci in the west of the area and the Getae further east), were one and the same people and spoke the same language.{{sfn|Price|2000|p=120}}

Another variety that has sometimes been recognized{{by whom|date=November 2013}} is that of [[Moesian]] (or Mysian) for the language of an intermediate area immediately to the south of Danube in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romanian Dobruja: this and the dialects north of the Danube have been grouped together as Daco-Moesian.{{sfn|Price|2000|p=120}} The language of the indigenous population has left hardly any trace in the anthroponymy of Moesia, but the toponymy indicates that the Moesii on the south bank of the Danube, north of the Haemus Mountains, and the Triballi in the valley of the Morava, shared a number of characteristic linguistic features{{specify|date=November 2013}} with the Dacii south of the Carpathians and the Getae in the Wallachian plain, which sets them apart from the Thracians though their languages are undoubtedly related.<ref>Polom<U+00E9> (1983) 540</ref>

[[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]] disputes that Dacian and Thracian were closely related for various reasons, most notably that Dacian and Moesian town names commonly end with the suffix ''-[[Dava (Dacian)|DAVA]]'', while towns in [[Thrace]] proper (i.e. South of the [[Balkan mountains]]) generally end in ''-PARA'' (see [[Dacian language]]). According to Georgiev, the language spoken by the ethnic Dacians should be classified as "Daco-Moesian" and regarded as distinct from Thracian.<ref>Georgiev (1960) 39-58</ref> Georgiev also claimed that names from approximately Roman Dacia and Moesia show different and generally less extensive changes in Indo-European consonants and vowels than those found in Thrace itself. However, the evidence seems to indicate divergence of a Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not so different as to qualify as separate languages.{{sfn | Crossland|Boardman| 1982 | p=838}} Polom<U+00E9> considers that such lexical differentiation ('' -dava'' vs. ''para'') would, however, be hardly enough evidence to separate Daco-Moesian from Thracian.{{sfn|Polom<U+00E9>|1982|p=876}}

An extensive account of the native tribes in Dacia can be found in the ninth tabula of Europe of Ptolemy<U+2019>s Geography.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46}} The Geography was probably written in the period AD 140<U+2013>150, but the sources were often earlier; for example, Roman Britain is shown before the building of Hadrian<U+2019>s Wall in the AD 120s.{{sfn|Koch J.|Koch J.T.|2007|p=1471}} Ptolemy's Geography also contains a physical map probably designed before the Roman conquest, and containing no detailed nomenclature.{{sfn|Sch<U+00FC>tte|1917|p=88}} There are references to the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]], but it appears that the Dacian map of the Tabula was completed after the final triumph of Roman nationality.{{sfn|Sch<U+00FC>tte|1917|p=89}} Ptolemy's list includes no fewer than twelve tribes with Geto-Dacian names.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=250}}

The fifteen tribes of Dacia as named by Ptolemy, starting from the northernmost ones, are as follows. First, the [[Anartes]], the [[Teurisci]] and the Coertoboci/[[Costoboci]]. To the south of them are the Buredeense ([[Burs (Dacia)|Buri]]/[[Burs (Dacia)|Burs]]), the [[Cotense]]/[[Cotini]] and then the [[Albocense]], the [[Potulatense]] and the [[Sense]], while the southernmost were the [[Saldense]], the [[Ciaginsi]] and the [[Piephigi]]. To the south of them were [[Predasense]]/Predavensi, the [[Rhadacense]]/Rhatacenses, the [[Caucoense]] (Cauci) and [[Biephi]].{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46}} Twelve out of these fifteen tribes listed by Ptolemy are ethnic Dacians,{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=250}} and three are Celt Anarti, Teurisci, and Cotense.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=250}} There are also previous brief mentions of other Getae or Dacian tribes on the left and right banks of the Danube, or even in Transylvania, to be added to the list of [[Ptolemy]]. Among these other tribes are the [[Trixae]], [[Crobidae]] and [[Appuli]].{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46}}

Some peoples inhabiting the region generally described in Roman times as "Dacia" were not ethnic Dacians.<ref name="Wilcox 2000 18 ">Wilcox (2000)18</ref> The true Dacians were a people of Thracian descent. German elements (Daco-Germans), Celtic elements (Daco-Celtic) and Iranian elements (Daco-Sarmatian) occupied territories in the north-west and north-east of Dacia.<ref name="Wilcox 2000 24 ">Wilcox (2000)24</ref><ref name="Wilcox 2000 24 "/>{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|pp=222-223}}<ref name="Wilcox 2000 18 "/> This region covered roughly the same area as modern [[Romania]] plus [[Bessarabia]] (Republic of [[Moldova]]) and eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (south-west Ukraine), although Ptolemy places Moldavia and Bessarabia in ''Sarmatia Europaea'', rather than ''Dacia''.<ref>Ptolemy III.5 and 8</ref> After the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] (AD 101-6), the Romans occupied only about half of the wider Dacian region. The [[Dacia (Roman province)|Roman province of Dacia]] covered just western [[Wallachia]] as far as the ''[[Limes Transalutanus]]'' (East of the river ''Aluta'', or [[Olt River|Olt]]) and [[Transylvania]], as bordered by the Carpathians.<ref>Barrington Plate 22</ref>

The impact of the Roman conquest on these people is uncertain. One hypothesis was that they were effectively eliminated. An important clue to the character of Dacian casualties is offered by the ancient sources Eutropius and Crito. Both speak about men when they describe the losses suffered by the Dacians in the wars. This suggests that both refer to losses due to fighting, not due to a process of extermination of the whole population.{{sfn | Ruscu | 2004 | p=78}} A strong component of the Dacian army, including the Celtic Bastarnae and the Germans, had withdrawn rather than submit to Trajan.<ref name="Wilcox 2000 27">Wilcox (2000)27</ref> Some scenes on Trajan<U+2019>s Column represent acts of obedience of the Dacian population, and others show the refugee Dacians returning to their own places.{{sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=51}} Dacians trying to buy amnesty are depicted on [[Trajan's Column]] (one offers to Trajan a tray of three gold ingots).{{sfn| MacKendrick |1975|p=90}} Alternatively, a substantial number may have survived in the province, although were probably outnumbered by the Romanised immigrants.<ref name="Millar 1970">Millar (1970)</ref> Cultural life in Dacia became very mixed and decidedly cosmopolitan because of the colonial communities. The Dacians retained their names and their own ways in the midst of the newcomers, and the region continued to exhibit Dacian characteristics.{{sfn | Bunson | 2002 | p=167}} The Dacians who survived the war are attested as revolting against the Roman domination in Dacia at least twice, in the period of time right after the Dacian Wars, and in a more determined manner in 117 AD.{{sfn | Pop | 2000 | p=22}} In 158 AD, they revolted again, and were put down by M. Statius Priscus.{{sfn | Denne Parker | 1958 | pp=12 and 19}} Some Dacians were apparently expelled from the occupied zone at the end of each of the two Dacian Wars, or otherwise emigrated. It is uncertain where these refugees settled. Some of these people might have mingled with the existing ethnic Dacian tribes beyond the Carpathians (the Costoboci and Carpi).

After Trajan<U+2019>s conquest of Dacia there was recurring trouble involving Dacian groups excluded from the Roman province, as finally defined by Hadrian. By the early third century the "Free Dacians", as they were earlier known, were a significantly troublesome group, then identified as the Carpi, requiring imperial intervention on more than one occasion.{{sfn | Wilkes | 2005 | p=224}} In 214 [[Caracalla]] dealt with their attacks. Later, [[Philip the Arab]] came in person to deal with them; he assumed the triumphal title Carpicus Maximus and inaugurated a new era for the province of Dacia (July 20, 246). Later both Decius and Gallienus assumed the titles Dacicus Maximus. In 272, Aurelian assumed the same title as Philip.{{sfn | Wilkes | 2005 | p=224}}

In about 140 AD, Ptolemy lists the names of several tribes residing on the fringes of the [[Roman Dacia]] (west, east and north of the Carpathian range), and the ethnic picture seems to be a mixed one. North of the Carpathians are recorded the Anarti, Teurisci and Costoboci.<ref>Ptolemy III.8</ref> The [[Anarti]] (or Anartes) and the Teurisci were originally probably Celtic peoples or mixed Dacian-Celtic.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|pp=222-223}} The Anarti, together with the Celtic [[Cotini]], are described by [[Tacitus]] as vassals of the powerful [[Quadi]] Germanic people.<ref>Tacitus G.43</ref> The Teurisci were probably a group of Celtic [[Taurisci]] from the eastern [[Alps]]. However, archaeology has revealed that the Celtic tribes had originally spread from west to east as far as Transylvania, before being absorbed by the Dacians in the 1st century BC.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=47}}{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|pp=461-462}}

====Costoboci====
{{Main|Costoboci}}
The main view is that the ''[[Costoboci]]'' were ethnically Dacian.<ref><ol class="references">

</ol></ref> Others considered them a Slavic or Sarmatian tribe.{{sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=100}}{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=184}} There was also a Celtic influence, so that some consider them a mixed Celtic and Thracian group that appear, after Trajan's conquest, as a Dacian group within the Celtic superstratum.{{sfn|Nandris|1976|p=729}} The Costoboci inhabited the southern slopes of the Carpathians.{{sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=98}} Ptolemy named the Coestoboci (Costoboci in Roman sources) twice, showing them divided by the Dniester and the Peucinian (Carpathian) Mountains. This suggests that they lived on both sides of the Carpathians, but it is also possible that two accounts about the same people were combined.{{sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=98}} There was also a group, the Transmontani, that some modern scholars identify as Dacian Transmontani Costoboci of the extreme north.{{sfn|Shutte|1917|p=100}}{{sfn|Parvan |Florescu |1982|p=135}} The name Transmontani was from the Dacians' Latin,{{sfn|Sir Smith|1856|p=961}} literally "people over the mountains". Mullenhoff identified these with the Transiugitani, another Dacian tribe north of the Carpathian mountains.{{sfn|Shutte|1917|p=18}}

Based on the account of [[Dio Cassius]], Heather (2010) considers that Hasding Vandals, around 171 AD, attempted to take control of lands which previously belonged to the free Dacian group called the Costoboci.{{sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=131}} Hrushevskyi (1997) mentions that the earlier widespread view that these Carpathian tribes were Slavic has no basis. This would be contradicted by the Coestobocan names themselves that are known from the inscriptions, written by a Coestobocan and therefore presumably accurately. These names sound quite unlike anything Slavic.{{sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=100}} Scholars such as Tomaschek (1883), Shutte (1917) and Russu (1969) consider these Costobocian names to be Thraco-Dacian.{{sfn | Tomaschek | 1883 | p=407}}{{sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=143}}{{sfn | Russu | 1969 | pp= 99,116 }} This inscription also indicates the Dacian background of the wife of the Costobocian king "Ziais Tiati filia Daca".<ref>VI, 1 801=ILS 854</ref> This indication of the socio-familial line of descent seen also in other inscriptions (i.e. Diurpaneus qui Euprepes Sterissae f(ilius) Dacus) is a custom attested since the historical period (beginning in the 5th century BC) when Thracians were under Greek influence.<ref>VI, 16, 903</ref> It may not have originated with the Thracians, as it could be just a fashion borrowed from Greeks for specifying ancestry and for distinguishing homonymous individuals within the tribe.{{sfn |Russu| 1967 | p=161}} Shutte (1917), Parvan, and Florescu (1982) pointed also to the Dacian characteristic place names ending in '<U+2013>dava' given by Ptolemy in the Costoboci<U+2019>s country.{{sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=101}}{{sfn | Parvan | Florescu| 1982| pp=142 and 152}}

====Carpi====
{{Main|Carpi (people)}}
The Carpi were a sizeable Dacian (North Thracian) group of tribes living outside the boundaries of Roman Dacia. The majority view is that they were a Thracian tribe, a subgroup of the Dacians.<ref><ol class="references">

According to Heather (2010), the Carpi were Dacians from the eastern foothills of the Carpathian range <U+2013> modern Moldavia and Wallachia <U+2013> who had not been brought under direct Roman rule at the time of Trajan's conquest of Transylvania Dacia. After they generated a new degree of political unity among themselves in the course of the third century, these Dacian groups came to be known collectively as the Carpi.{{sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=114}}
[[File:Captive dacian pushkin.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Dacian cast in Pushkin museum, after original in Lateran Museum. Early second century AD.]]

The ancient sources about the Carpi, before 104 AD, located them on a territory situated between the western side of Eastern European Galicia and the mouth of the Danube.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=239}} The name of the tribe is homonymous with the Carpathian mountains.{{sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=100}} Carpi and Carpathian are Dacian words derived from the root ''(s)ker''- "cut" cf. Albanian ''Karp'' "stone" and Sanskrit ''kar''- "cut".{{sfn | Russu | 1969 | pp=114-115}}{{sfn | Tomaschek | 1883 |p=403}}
A quote from the 6th-century Byzantine chronicler [[Zosimus]] referring to the <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9> (Latin: ''Carpo-Dacae'' or "Carpo-Dacians"), who attacked the Romans in the late 4th century, is seen as evidence of their Dacian ethnicity. In fact, Carpi/Carpodaces is the term used for Dacians outside of Dacia proper.{{sfn | Goffart | 2006 |p=205}}
However, that the Carpi were Dacians is shown not so much by the form <U+039A><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03B9> (Latin: ''Carpo-Dacae'') of [[Zosimus]] as by their characteristic place-names in <U+2013>''dava'', given by Ptolemy in their country.{{sfn | Minns | 2011 | p=124}} The origin and ethnic affiliations of the Carpi have been debated over the years; in modern times they are closely associated with the Carpathian Mountains, and a good case has been made for attributing to the Carpi a distinct material culture, "a developed form of the Geto-Dacian La Tene culture", often known as the Poienesti culture, which is characteristic of this area.{{sfn| Nixon| Saylor Rodgers|1995|p=116}}

Dacians are represented in the statues surmounting the [[Arch of Constantine]] and on [[Trajan's Column]].{{sfn | Westropp | 2003 | p=104}} The artist of the Column took some care to depict, in his opinion, a variety of Dacian people<U+2014>from high-ranking men, women, and children to the near-savage. Although the artist looked to models in Hellenistic art for some body types and compositions, he does not represent the Dacians as generic barbarians.{{sfn | Clarke | 2003 |p=37 }}

Classical authors applied a generalized stereotype when describing the  "barbarians"{{mdash}}Celts, Scythians, Thracians{{mdash}}inhabiting the regions to the north of the Greek world.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}} In accordance with this stereotype, all these peoples are described, in sharp contrast to the "civilized" Greeks, as being much taller, their skin lighter and with straight light-coloured hair and blue eyes.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}} For instance, [[Aristotle]] wrote that "the Scythians on the Black Sea and the Thracians are straight-haired, for both they themselves and the environing air are moist";<ref>{{cite web | last = Aristotle | first = | authorlink = Aristotle | coauthors = | title = Hair (V.3.)  | work = De Generatione Animalium (Translated by Arthur Platt) | publisher = Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library | year = 2001 | url = http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AriGene.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=all | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2014-01-11  | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}</ref> according to [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Xenophanes]] described the Thracians as "ruddy and tawny".{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}}<ref>{{cite web | last = Clement of Alexandria | first = | authorlink = Clement of Alexandria | coauthors = | title = The heathens made gods like themselves, whence springs all superstition (VII.4.)  | work = The Stromata, or Miscellanies | publisher = Early Christian Writings | date = | url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book7.html | doi = | accessdate = 2014-01-11  | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}</ref> On Trajan<U+2019>s column, Dacian soldiers' hair is depicted longer than the hair of Roman soldiers and they had trimmed beards.{{sfn | Waldman | Mason | 2006| p=208}}

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|Getae on the World Map according to Herodotus]]

In the absence of historical records written by the Dacians (and Thracians) themselves, analysis of their origins depends largely on the remains of material culture. On the whole, the Bronze Age witnessed the evolution of the ethnic groups which emerged during the [[Eneolithic]] period, and eventually the syncretism of both autochthonous and Indo-European elements from the steppes and the Pontic regions.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166}} Various groups of Thracians had not separated out by 1200 BC, {{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166}} but there are strong similarities between the ceramic types found at Troy and the ceramic types from the Carpathian area.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166}} About the year 1000 BC, the Carpatho-Danubian countries were inhabited by a northern branch of the Thracians.{{sfn|Parvan|1928|p=35}} At the time of the arrival of the Scythians (c. 700 BC), the Carpatho-Danubian Thracians were developing rapidly towards the Iron Age civilization of the West. Moreover, the whole of the fourth period of the Carpathian Bronze Age had already been profoundly influenced by the first Iron Age as it developed in Italy and the Alpine lands. The Scythians, arriving with their own type of Iron Age civilization, put a stop to these relations with the West.{{sfn | Parvan | Vulpe|Vulpe | 2002 | p=49 }} From roughly 500 BC (the second Iron Age), the Dacians developed a distinct civilization, which was capable of supporting large centralised kingdoms by 1st BC and 1st AD.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 }}

Since the very first detailed account by Herodotus, Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracians.{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}} Still, they are distinguished from the other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}} The first written mention of the name "Dacians" is in Roman sources, but classical authors are unanimous in considering them a branch of the Getae, a Thracian people known from Greek writings. [[Strabo]] specified that the Daci are the Getae who lived in the area towards the [[Pannonian plain]] ([[Transylvania]]), while the Getae proper gravitated towards the Black Sea coast ([[Scythia Minor]]).

===Relations with Thracians===
{{See also|Dromichaetes}}

Since the writings of Herodotus in the 5th century BC,{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}} Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracian sphere of influence. Despite this, they are distinguished from other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}} Geto-Dacians and Thracians were kin people but they were not the same.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=661}} The differences from the southern Thracians or from the neighboring Scythians were probably faint, as several ancient authors make confusions of identification with both groups.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}}

In the 19th century, [[Wilhelm Tomaschek|Tomaschek]] considered a close affinity between the Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians, an original kinship of both people with Iranian peoples.{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401}} They are [[Aryan]] tribes, several centuries before [[Scolotes]] of the Pont and [[Sauromatae]] left the Aryan homeland and settled in the Carpathian chain, in the [[Haemus]] (Balkan) and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains.{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401}} The Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians separated very early from Aryans, since their language still maintains roots that are missing from Iranian and it shows non-Iranian phonetic characteristics (i.e. replacing the Iranian "l" with "r").{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401}} He considered that the Geto-Dacians and Besso-Thracians would represent a new layer of people that extended in the autochthonous fund, probably [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] or [[Armenians|Armenian]]-Phrygian.{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401}}

===Relations with Celts===

]]

Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the [[Tisa River]] before the rise of the Celtic [[Boii]], and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians under king Burebista.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215}} During the second half of the 4th century BC, Celtic cultural influence appears in the archaeological records of the middle Danube, Alpine region, and north-western Balkans, where it was part of the Middle [[La T<U+00E8>ne]] material culture. This material appears in north-western and central Dacia, and is reflected especially in burials.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 }} The Dacians absorbed the Celtic influence from the northwest in the early third century BC.{{sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50}} Archaeological investigation of this period has highlighted several Celtic warrior graves with military equipment. It suggests the forceful penetration of a military Celtic elite within the region of Dacia, now known as Transylvania, that is bounded on the east by the Carpathian range.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 |p=549}} The archaeological sites of the third and second centuries BC in Transylvania revealed a pattern of co-existence and fusion between the bearers of La T<U+00E8>ne culture and indigenous Dacians. These were domestic dwellings with a mixture of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and several graves in the Celtic style containing vessels of Dacian type.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 |p=549}} There are some seventy Celtic sites in Transylvania, mostly cemeteries, but most if not all of them indicate that the native population imitated Celtic art forms that took their fancy, but remained obstinately and fundamentally Dacian in their culture.{{sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50}}

[[File:Celtic Helmet from Satu Mare, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|300px]] The Celtic Helmet from [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]], Romania (northern Dacia), an Iron Age raven totem helmet, dated around 4th century BC. A similar helmet is depicted on the Thraco-Celtic [[Gundestrup cauldron]], being worn by one of the mounted warriors (detail tagged [http://www.flickr.com/photos/28433765@N07/3219662507/ here]). See also an [http://www.flickr.com/photos/celtico/3751742958/ illustration of Brennos wearing a similar helmet].
Around 150 BC, La T<U+00E8>ne material disappears from the area. This coincides with the ancient writings which mention the rise of Dacian authority. It ended the Celtic domination, and it is possible that Celts were driven out of Dacia. Alternatively, some scholars have proposed that the [[Celts in Transylvania|Transylvanian Celts]] remained, but merged into the local culture and thus ceased to be distinctive.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 }}{{sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50}}

Archaeological discoveries in the settlements and fortifications of the Dacians in the period of their kingdoms (1st century BC and 1st century AD) included imported Celtic vessels, and others made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic prototypes, showing that relations between the Dacians and the Celts from the regions north and west of Dacia continued.{{sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=550}} In present-day [[Slovakia]], archaeology has revealed evidence for mixed Celtic-Dacian populations in the [[Nitra]] and [[Hron]] river basins.{{sfn | Skvarna | Cicaj | Letz| 2000 | p=14}}

After the Dacians subdued the Celtic tribes, the remaining [[Cotini]] stayed in the mountains of Central Slovakia, where they took up mining and metalworking. Together with the original domestic population, they created the [[Puchov culture]] that spread into central and northern Slovakia, including [[Spi<U+0161>|Spis]], and penetrated northeastern [[Moravia]] and southern Poland. Along the [[Bodorog]] River in [[Zempl<U+00ED>n (region)|Zemplin]] they created Celtic-Dacian settlements which were known for the production of painted ceramics.{{sfn | Skvarna | Cicaj | Letz| 2000 | p=14}}

===Relations with Greeks===
{{See also|Decree of Dionysopolis|List of Greek cities in Thrace and Dacia|Lysimachus}}
Greek and Roman chroniclers record the defeat and capture of the Macedonian general [[Lysimachus]] in the 3rd century BC by the Getae (Dacians) ruled by [[Dromichaetes|Dromihete]], their military strategy, and the release of Lysimachus following a debate in the assembly of the Getae.

===Relations with Persians===
Herodotus says: "before [[Darius I|Darius]] reached the Danube, the first people he subdued were the Getae, who believed that they never die".{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}} It is possible that the Persian expedition and the subsequent occupation may have altered the way in which the Getae expressed the immortality belief. The influence of thirty years of [[Achaemenid]] presence may be detected in the emergence of an explicit iconography of the "Royal Hunt" that influenced Dacian and Thracian metalworkers, and of the practice of [[Falconry|hawking]] by their upper class.{{sfn | Taylor | 1987| p=130}}

===Relations with Scythians===
{{See also|Agathyrsi|Scythia Minor|Alans|Roxolani|Iazyges}}

====Agathyrsi Transylvania====
The Scythians' arrival in the Carpathian mountains is dated to 700 BC.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1928|p=48}} The [[Agathyrsi]] of Transylvania had been mentioned by Herodotus (fifth century BC),{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.48-4.49}} who regarded them as not a Scythian people, but closely related to them. In other respects their customs were close to those of the Thracians.<ref>Herodotus, Rawlinson G, Rawlinson H, Gardner (1859) 93</ref> The Agathyrsi were completely denationalized at the time of Herodotus and absorbed by the native Thracians.{{sfn| Thomson |1948|p=399}}{{sfn|Parvan|1928|p=48}}

The opinion that the Agathyrsi were almost certainly Thracians results also from the writings preserved by [[Stephen of Byzantium]], who explains that the Greeks called the [[Trausi]] the [[Agathyrsi]], and we know that the [[Trausi]] lived in the [[Rhodope Mountains]]. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians.{{sfn| Hrushevsky<U+012D> | Poppe | Skorupsky | 1997 |p=97}} That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.{{sfn| Hrushevsky<U+012D> | Poppe | Skorupsky | 1997 |p=97}}

===Dacian kingdoms===
{{Main|Dacia}}
{{See also|Burebista|Decebalus}}
[[File:Dacia 82 BC.png|right|thumb|[[Dacia]]n kingdom during the reign of [[Burebista]], 82 BC]]

Dacian states arose as a tribal confederacy that included the Getae, the Daci, the Buri, and the Carpi{{dubious|date = November 2013}} (cf. Bichir 1976, Shchukin 1989),{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215}} united only periodically by the leadership of Dacian kings such as [[Burebista]] and [[Decebal]]. This union was both military-political and ideological-religious.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215}} The following are some of the attested Dacian kingdoms:

The kingdom of [[Cothelas]], one of the Getae, covered an area near the Black Sea, between northern Thrace and the Danube, today Bulgaria, in the 4th century BC.<ref>Lewis et al. 2008, p. 773</ref> The kingdom of [[Rubobostes]] controlled a region in Transylvania in the 2nd century BC.{{sfn | Berresford Ellis | 1996 | p=61}} [[Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (proconsul 75-3 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the [[Moesi]], becoming the first Roman general to reach the river Danube with his army.<ref>Smith's Dictionary: ''Curio''</ref> His successor, [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus|Marcus Licinius Lucullus]], brother of the famous [[Lucullus|Lucius Lucullus]], campaigned against the Thracian [[Bessi]] tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of [[Moesia]], the region between the Haemus (Balkan) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of Scythia Minor (the modern [[Dobruja]] region in Romania and Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome's [[Hellenistic]] arch-enemy, king [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Pontus]], in the [[Third Mithridatic War]].<ref>Smith's Dictionary: ''Lucullus''</ref> Greek geographer Strabo claimed that the Dacians and Getae had been able to muster a combined army of 200,000 men during Strabo's era, the time of Roman emperor [[Augustus]].{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,13}}

====The kingdom of Burebista====
The Dacian kingdom reached its maximum extent under king Burebista (ruled 82 - 44 BC). The capital of the kingdom was possibly the city of [[Argedava]], also called Sargedava in some historical writings, situated close to the river Danube. The kingdom of Burebista extended south of the Danube, in what is today Bulgaria, and the Greeks believed their king was the greatest of all Thracians.{{sfn|Grumeza|2009|p=54}}{{better source|date=February 2014}} During his reign, Burebista transferred the Geto-Dacians' capital from Argedava to [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]].{{sfn| MacKendrick |1975|p=48}}{{sfn| Goodman | Sherwood |2002|p=227}} For at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegethusa was the Dacian capital, reaching its acme under king Decebal. Burebista annexed the Greek cities (55-48 BC).<ref>Cri<U+015F>an (1978) 118</ref> Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida|C. Antonius]] at [[Histria (Sinoe)]] 32 years before, and to recover the lost standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called [[Genucla]] (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, in the Danube delta region of Romania), controlled by [[Zyraxes]], the local Getan petty king.<ref name="Dio LI.26.5">Dio LI.26.5</ref> The man selected for the task was [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]], grandson of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] the [[First Triumvirate|triumvir]], and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.<ref>Dio LI.23.2</ref>

====The kingdom of Decebalus 87 <U+2013> 106====
By the year AD 100, more than 400,000 square kilometers were dominated by the Dacians, who numbered two million.<ref>De Imperatoribus Romanis". http://www.roman-emperors.org/assobd.htm#t-inx. Retrieved 2007-11-08. "In the year 88, the Romans resumed the offensive. The Roman troops were now led by the general Tettius Iulianus. The battle took place again at Tapae but this time the Romans defeated the Dacians. For fear of falling into a trap, Iulianus abandoned his plans of conquering Sarmizegetuza and, at the same time, Decebalus asked for peace. At first, Domitian refused this request, but after he was defeated in a war in Pannonia against the Marcomanni (a Germanic tribe), the emperor was obliged to accept the peace."</ref> Decebalus was the last king of the Dacians, and despite his fierce resistance against the Romans, was defeated and committed suicide rather than being marched through Rome in a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] as a captured enemy leader.

===Conflict with Rome===
{{Main|Domitian's Dacian War|Trajan's Dacian Wars}}

Burebista's Dacian state was powerful enough to threaten Rome, and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] contemplated campaigning against the Dacians.{{sfn | Taylor | 1994 |p=404}} Despite this, the formidable Dacian power under [[Burebista]] lasted only until his death in 44 BC. The subsequent division of Dacia continued for about a century until the reign of [[Scorillo]]. This was a period of only occasional attacks on the Roman Empire<U+2019>s border, with some local significance.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54}}

The unifying actions of King Scorillo (27 BC <U+2013> AD 14) and of the last King Decebalus (ruled 87<U+2013>106 AD) might have been perceived as dangerous by Rome, despite the fact that the Dacian army could now gather only some 40,000 soldiers.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54}} In the Romans<U+2019> eyes, the situation at the border with Dacia was out of control, and Emperor [[Domitian]] (ruled 81 to 96 AD) tried desperately to deal with the danger through military action. But the outcome of Rome's disastrous campaigns into Dacia in AD 86 and AD 88 pushed Domitian to settle the situation through diplomacy.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54}} Emperor [[Trajan]] (ruled 97<U+2013>117 AD) opted for a different approach and decided to conquer the Dacian kingdom, partly in order to seize its vast [[gold mines]]. The effort required two major wars (the Dacian Wars), one in 101<U+2013>102 AD and the other in 105<U+2013>106 AD. Only fragmentary details survive of the Dacian war: a single sentence of Trajan<U+2019>s own Dacica; little more of the Getica written by his doctor, T. Statilius Crito; nothing whatsoever of the poem proposed by Caninius Rufus (if it was ever written), Dio Chrysostom<U+2019>s Getica or Appian<U+2019>s Dacica. Nonetheless, a reasonable account can be pieced together.{{sfn|Bennett|1997|p=97}}

[[File:RomansoldiersvsDacianwarriors.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]] depicted on [[Trajan's column]]]]
In the first war, Trajan invaded Dacia by crossing the river Danube with a boat-bridge and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dacians at the [[Second Battle of Tapae]] in 101 AD. The Dacian king Decebalus was forced to sue for peace. Trajan and Decebalus then concluded a peace treaty which was highly favourable to the Romans. The peace agreement required the Dacians to cede some territory to the Romans and to demolish their fortifications. Decebalus' foreign policy was also restricted, as he was prohibited from entering into alliances with other tribes.

However, both Trajan and Decebalus considered this only a temporary truce, and readied themselves for renewed war. Trajan had Greek engineer [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] construct a stone bridge over the Danube river, while Decebalus secretly plotted alliances against the Romans. In 105, Trajan crossed the Danube river and besieged Decebalus' capital, [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]], but the siege failed because of Decebalus' allied tribes. However, Trajan was an optimist. He returned with a newly constituted army and took Sarmizegetusa by assault. Decebalus fled into the mountains hoping to assemble a new army, but was cornered by pursuing Roman cavalry and committed suicide. The Romans took his head and right hand to Trajan, who had them displayed in the [[Forum Romanum|Forums]]. [[Trajan's Column]] in Rome was constructed to celebrate the conquest of Dacia.

The Roman people hailed Trajan's triumph in Dacia with the longest and most expensive celebration in their history.{{sfn | Hooper | 2002 |p=434}} For his triumph, Trajan gave a 123-day festival ([[ludi]]) of celebration, in which approximately 11,000 animals were slaughtered and 11,000 gladiators fought in combats. This surpassed Emperor Titus's celebration in AD 70, when a 100-day festival included 3,000 gladiators and 5,000 to 9,000 wild animals.{{sfn | Snooks | 1997 |p=154}}{{sfn | Campbell | 2002 |p=144}}

Only about half part of Dacia then became a Roman province,{{sfn | Boia | 2001 |p=47}} with a newly built capital at [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]], 40&nbsp;km away from the site of Old Sarmizegetusa, which was razed to the ground.

Dacians that remained outside the Roman Empire after the Dacian wars of AD 101-106 had been named Dakoi prosoroi (Latin ''Daci limitanei''), "neighbouring Dacians".<ref name="Gara<U+0161>anin, Benac 1973 243"/> Modern historians use the generic name "Free Dacians" or ''Independent Dacians''.{{sfn|Bowman| Cameron |Garnsey | 2005|p=224}}{{sfn|Sch<U+00FC>tte|1917|p=143}}<ref name="Tomaschek (1883) 407 ">Tomaschek (1883) 407</ref> The tribes Daci Magni (Great Dacians), Costoboci (generally considered a Dacian subtribe), and Carpi remained outside the Roman empire, in what the Romans called ''Dacia Libera'' (Free Dacia).{{sfn|Waldman |Mason |2006|p=205}} By the early third century the "Free Dacians" were a significantly troublesome group, by now identified as the Carpi.{{sfn|Bowman| Cameron |Garnsey | 2005|p=224}} Bichir argues that the Carpi were the most powerful of the Dacian tribes who had become the principal enemy of the Romans in the region.{{sfn|Siani-Davies P.|Siani-Davies M.|Deletant |2006|p=205}} In 214 AD, Caracalla campaigned against the Free Dacians.{{sfn | Cowan | 2003 | p=5 }} There were also campaigns against the Dacians recorded in 236 AD.{{sfn | Hazel | 2002 | p=360}}

Roman Dacia was evacuated by the Romans under emperor Aurelian (ruled 271-5 AD). Aurelian made this decision on account of barbarian pressures on the Empire there caused by the Carpi, Visigoths, Sarmatians, and Asding Vandals; the lines of defence needed to be shortened, and Dacia was deemed not important enough given the demands on available resources. Roman power in Thracia rested mainly with the legions stationed in Moesia. The rural nature of Thracia's populations, and the distance from Roman authority, encouraged the presence of local troops to support Moesia's legions. Over the next few centuries, the province was periodically and increasingly attacked by migrating Germanic tribes. The reign of [[Justinian]] saw the construction of over 100 [[Roman Legion|legionary]] fortresses to supplement the defense. Thracians in Moesia and Dacia were [[Romanized]], while those within the [[Byzantine empire]] were their Hellenized descendants that had mingled with the Greeks.

[[File:Dacian Constantin Arch IMG 6559.jpg|right|thumb|Dacian on the Constantine Arch]]
Dacia was never a uniformly Romanised area. Post-Aurelianic Dacia fell into three divisions: the area along the river, usually under some type of Roman administration even if in a highly barbarized form; the zone beyond this area, from which Roman military personnel had withdrawn, leaving a sizable population behind that was heavily Romanised; and finally what is now the northern parts of Moldavia, Crisana, and Maramures. This final area was always peripheral to the Roman province, not militarily occupied but nonetheless controlled by Rome and part of the Roman economic sphere. Here lived the Carpi, often called <U+201C>Free Dacians<U+201D>.{{sfn | Burns | 1991 | pp=110-111 }}

The Aurelian retreat was a purely military decision to withdraw the Roman troops to defend the Danube. The inhabitants of the old province of Dacia displayed no awareness of impeding disaster. There were no sudden flights or destruction of property.{{sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 }} It is not possible to discern how many civilians followed the army out of Dacia; it is clear that there was no mass emigration, since there is evidence of continuity of settlement in Dacian villages and farms; the evacuation may not at first have been intended to be a permanent measure.{{sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 }} The Romans left the province, but they didn<U+2019>t consider that they lost it.{{sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 }} Dobrogea was not abandoned at all, but continued as part of the Roman Empire for over 350 years.{{sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=161}} As late as AD 300, the [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchic]] emperors had resettled tens of thousands of Dacian Carpi inside the empire, dispersing them in communities the length of the Danube, from Hungary to the Black Sea.{{sfn | Heather | 2006 | p=159 }}

==Society==
[[File:Roman bust of a Dacian tarabostes, Hermitage, St Petersburg, Russia - 20070614.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dacian tarabostes (nobleman) - (Hermitage Museum)]]
[[File:Comati dacians romanian goverment picture.jpg|thumb|110px|right|Comati on Trajan's Column, Rome]]
Dacians were divided into two classes: the aristocracy (''tarabostes'') and the common people (''comati''). Only the aristocracy had the right to cover their heads, and wore a [[Phrygian cap|felt hat]]. The common people, who comprised the rank and file of the army, the [[peasant]]s and artisans, might have been called ''capillati'' in Latin. Their appearance and clothing can be seen on [[Trajan's Column]].

===Occupations===
[[File:2007 Dacian Engineering Tools.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Dacian tools: compasses, chisels, knives, etc.]]
The chief occupations of the Dacians were [[agriculture]], [[apiculture]], [[viticulture]], [[livestock]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and [[metalworking]]. They also worked the gold and silver mines of Transylvania. At Pecica, [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] a Dacian workshop was discovered, along with equipment for minting coins and evidence of bronze, silver, and iron-working that suggests a broad spectrum of smithing.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 }} Evidence for the mass production of iron is found on many Dacian sites, indicating guild-like specialization.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 }} Dacian ceramic manufacturing traditions continue from the pre-Roman to the Roman period, both in provincial and unoccupied Dacia, and well into the fourth and even early fifth centuries.{{sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=229}} They engaged in considerable external trade, as is shown by the number of foreign coins found in the country (see also [[Decebalus Treasure]]). On the northernmost frontier of "free Dacia", coin circulation steadily grew in the first and second centuries, with a decline in the third and a rise again in the fourth century; the same pattern as observed for the Banat region to the southwest. What is remarkable is the extent and increase in coin circulation even after Roman withdrawal from Dacia, and as far north as Transcarpathia.{{sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=232}}

===Currency===
[[File:Koson 79000126.jpg|thumb|left|Geto-Dacian [[Coson|Koson]]. Mid 1st century BC]]
The first coins produced by the Geto-Dacians were imitations of silver coins of the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander III (the Great). Early in the 1st century BC, the Dacians replaced these with silver denarii of the Roman Republic, both official coins of Rome exported to Dacia, as well as locally made imitations of them. The Roman province Dacia is represented on the Roman [[sestertius]] coin as a woman seated on a rock, holding an [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]], a small child on her knee. The aquila holds ears of grain, and another small child is seated before her holding grapes.

===Construction===
{{See also|Dacian Fortresses of the Or<U+0103><U+015F>tie Mountains|Murus dacicus}}
Dacians had developed the [[murus dacicus]] (double-skinned ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmizegetusa in what is today [[Hunedoara County]], Romania.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215}} This type of wall has been discovered not only in the Dacian citadel of the Orastie mountains, but also in those at [[Dacian fortress of Covasna|Covasna]], [[Dacian fortress of Breaza|Breaza]] near [[F<U+0103>g<U+0103>ra<U+0219>]], [[Dacian fortress of Tili<U+0219>ca|Tili<U+0219>ca]] near [[Sibiu]], [[Dacian fortress of C<U+0103>p<U+00E2>lna|C<U+0103>p<U+00E2>lna]] in the [[Sebe<U+0219>]] valley, [[Dacian fortress of B<U+0103>ni<U+021B>a|B<U+0103>ni<U+021B>a]] not far from [[Petro<U+0219>ani]], and [[Apulon|Piatra Craivii]] to the north of [[Alba Iulia]].{{sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=91 }} The degree of their urban development was displayed on [[Trajan's Column]] and in the account of how Sarmizegetusa was defeated by the Romans. The Romans identified and destroyed the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] of the Dacian capital, only thus being able to end the long siege of Sarmizegetusa.

==Material culture==

According to archaeological findings, the cradle of the Dacian culture is considered to be north of the Danube towards the Carpathian mountains, in the historical Romanian province of [[Muntenia]]. It is identified as an evolution of the [[Iron Age]] [[Basarabi culture]]. The earlier Iron Age Basarabi evidence in the northern lower Danube area connects to the iron-using Ferigile-Birsesti group. This is an archaeological manifestation of the historical Getae who, along with the Agathyrsae, are one of a number of tribal formations recorded by Herodotus.{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.48-4.49}}{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=86 }} In archaeology, "free Dacians" are attested by the [[Puchov culture]] (in which there are Celtic elements) and [[Lipi<U+0163>a culture]] to the east of the Carpathians.{{sfn| Millar |1981|p=279}} The Lipi<U+0163>a culture has a Dacian/North Thracian origin.{{sfn | Shchukin|Kazanski|Sharov | 2006 | p=20 }} {{sfn | Kostrzewski | 1949 | p=230 }} This North Thracian population was dominated by strong Celtic influences, or had simply absorbed Celtic ethnic components.{{sfn |Ja<U+017C>d<U+017C>ewski | 1948 | p=76}} Lipi<U+0163>a culture has been linked to the Dacian tribe of [[Costoboci]].{{sfn | Shchukin | 1989 | p=306 }}{{sfn | Parvan | Florescu | 1982 | p=547 }}

Specific Dacian material culture includes: wheel-turned pottery that is generally plain but with distinctive elite wares, massive silver dress [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], precious metal plate, ashlar masonry, fortifications, upland sanctuaries with horseshoe-shaped precincts, and decorated clay heart altars at settlement sites. Among many discovered artifacts, the [[Dacian bracelets]] stand out, depicting their cultural and aesthetic sense.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 }} There are difficulties correlating funerary monuments chronologically with Dacian settlements; a small number of burials are known, along with cremation pits, and isolated rich burials as at Cugir.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 }} Dacian burial ritual continued under Roman occupation and into the post-Roman period.{{sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=233}}

===Language===
{{Main|Dacian language}}
{{See also|Davae|Thracian language|Languages of the Roman Empire}}
The Dacians are generally considered to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity from earlier Iron Age communities.{{sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=215}} Some historians and linguists consider Dacian language to be a dialect of or the same language as [[Thracian language|Thracian]].{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=401}} The vocalism and consonantism differentiate the Dacian and Thracian languages.{{sfn|P<U+00E2>rvan|1926|p=648}} Others consider that Dacian and [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] form regional varieties (dialects) of a common language. (Thracians inhabited modern southern Bulgaria and northern Greece. Illyrians lived in modern Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia.)

The ancient languages of these people became extinct, and their cultural influence highly reduced, after the repeated invasions of the Balkans by Celts, [[Huns]], Goths, and Sarmatians, accompanied by persistent [[hellenization]], romanisation and later [[slavicisation]]. Therefore, in the study of the toponomy of Dacia, one must take account of the fact that some place-names were taken by the Slavs from as yet unromanised Dacians.{{sfn|Pares|Seton-Watso|Williams|Brooke Jopson |1939|p=149}} A number of Dacian words are preserved in ancient sources, amounting to about 1150 anthroponyms and 900 toponyms, and in Discorides some of the rich plant lore of the Dacians is preserved along with the names of 42 medicinal plants.{{sfn|Nandris|1976|p=730}}

The Dacians knew about writing.{{sfn| Turnock |1988|p=42 }}{{sfn| Cunliffe |1994|p=193 }}{{sfn | Millar | 1981 | p=275}} Permanent contacts with the Graeco-Roman world had brought the use of the Greek and later the Latin alphabet.{{sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=94 }} It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there is no doubt about the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society.{{sfn | Glodariu | 1976 | p=101 }} However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains.{{sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=94}} Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.{{sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=95}}

===Religion===
{{Main|Dacian mythology}}

[[File:Zalmoxis Aleksandrovo.jpg|thumb|140px|Detail of the main fresco of the [[Aleksandrovo kurgan]]. The figure is identified with Zalmoxis.]]

Dacian religion was considered by the classic sources as a key source of authority, suggesting to some that Dacia was a predominantly theocratic state led by priest-kings. However, the layout of the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa indicates the possibility of co-rulership, with a separate high king and high priest.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 }} Ancient sources recorded the names of several Dacian high priests (Deceneus, Comosicus and Vezina) and various orders of priests: "god-worshipers", "smoke-walkers" and "founders".{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 }} Both Hellenistic and Oriental influences are discernible in the religious background, alongside [[chthonic]] and solar motifs.{{sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 }}

According to Herodotus' account of the story of [[Zalmoxis]] or Zamolxis,{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}} the Getae (speaking the same language as the Dacians, according to [[Strabo]]) believed in the immortality of the soul, and regarded death as merely a change of country. Their chief priest held a prominent position as the representative of the supreme deity, Zalmoxis, who is called also Gebeleizis by some among them.{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}}<ref>Histories by Herodotus Book 4 translated by G. Rawlinson</ref> Strabo wrote about the high priest [[Decaeneus]]: "a man who not only had wandered through Egypt, but also had thoroughly learned certain prognostics through which he would pretend to tell the divine will; and within a short time he was set up as god (as I said when relating the story of Zamolxis)."{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,11}}

[[File:Relief Bendis BM 2155.jpg|thumb|left|Votive stele representing Bendis wearing a Dacian cap ([[British Museum]])]]

The Goth [[Jordanes]] in his ''[[Getica]]'' (''[[The origin and deeds of the Goths]]''), gives an account of [[Deceneus]], the highest priest of King Burebista, and considered Dacians a nation related to the Goths. Besides Zalmoxis, the Dacians believed in other deities, such as Gebeleizis, the god of storm and lightning,  possibly related to the Thracian god [[Zibelthiurdos]].<ref>Tomashek,''Die Alten Thrakern'', II, page 62</ref> He was represented as a handsome man, sometimes with a beard. Later Gebeleizis was equated with Zalmoxis as the same god. According to Herodotus, Gebeleizis (*Zebeleizis/Gebeleizis who is only mentioned by Herodotus) is just another name of Zalmoxis.{{sfn|Glodariu|Pop|Nagler|2005|p=120}}{{sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97}}{{sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=410}}{{sfn|Paliga|1994|p=440}}

Another important deity was [[Bendis]], goddess of the moon and the hunt.<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Thrakios/Bendis.html BENDIS : Thracian goddess of the moon & hunting ; mythology ; pictures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
By a decree of the [[Dodona|oracle of Dodona]], which required the Athenians to grant land for a shrine or temple, her cult was introduced into [[Attica, Greece|Attica]] by immigrant Thracian residents,<ref>Extensive discussion of whether the date is 429 or 413 BC was reviewed and newly analyzed in Christopher Planeaux, "The Date of Bendis' Entry into Attica" ''The Classical Journal'' '''96'''.2 (December 2000:165-192). Planeaux offers a reconstruction of the inscription mentioninmg the first introduction, p</ref> and, though Thracian and Athenian processions remained separate, both cult and festival became so popular that in Plato's time (c. 429-13 BC) its festivities were naturalised as an official ceremony of the Athenian city-state, called the '''Bendideia'''.<ref>Fifth-century fragmentary inscriptions that record formal descrees regarding formal aspects of the Bendis cult, are reproduced in Planeaux 2000:170f</ref>

Known Dacian theonyms include ''Zalmoxis'', ''Gebele<U+00EF>zis'' and ''[[Derzelas|Darzalas]]''.<ref>Hdt. 4.94,Their belief in their immortality is as follows: they believe that they do not die, but that one who perishes goes to the deity Salmoxis, or Gebele<U+00EF>zis, as some of them call him.</ref><ref>Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898),(Zalmoxis) or Zamolxis (Zamolxis). Said to have been so called from the bear's skin (zalmos) in which he was clothed as soon as he was born. He was, according to the story current among the Greeks on the Hellespont, a Getan, who had been a slave to Pythagoras in Samos, but was manumitted, and acquired not only great wealth, but large stores of knowledge from Pythagoras, and from the Egyptians, whom he visited in the course of his travels. He returned among the Getae, introducing the civilization and the religious ideas which he had gained, especially regarding the immortality of the soul. Herodotus, however, suspects that he was an indigenous Getan divinity ( Herod.iv. 95)</ref> Gebeleizis is probably cognate to the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos (also ''Zbelsurdos'', ''Zibelthurdos''), wielder of lightning and thunderbolts. '''Derzelas''' (also ''Darzalas'') was a chthonic god of health and human vitality. The pagan religion survived longer in Dacia than in other parts of the empire; Christianity made little headway until the fifth century.{{sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 }}

===Pottery===

Fragments of pottery with different "inscriptions" with Latin and Greek letters incised before and after firing have been discovered in the settlement at Ocnita <U+2013> Valcea.{{sfn | Glodariu | 1976 | p=128 }} An inscription carries the word Basileus (<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2> in Greek, meaning "king") and seems to have been written before the vessel was hardened by fire.{{sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=67}} Other inscriptions contain the name of the king, believed to be Thiemarcus,{{sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=67}} and Latin groups of letters (BVR, REB).{{sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=26 }} BVR indicates the name of the tribe or union of tribes, the Buridavensi Dacians who lived at Buridava and who were mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century AD under the name of Buridavensioi.{{sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=66 }}

===Clothing and science===
The typical dress of Dacians, both men and women, can be seen on Trajan's column.{{sfn | Bury | Cook |Adcock|Percival Charlesworth| 1954 |p=543 }} Dio Chrysostom described the Dacians as natural philosophers.{{sfn | Sidebottom | 2007 |p=5}}

==Warfare==
{{Main|Dacian warfare}}
The history of Dacian warfare spans from c. 10th century BC up to the 2nd century AD in the region typically referred to by Ancient Greek and Latin historians as Dacia. It concerns the armed conflicts of the Dacian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between Dacians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Dacian tribes as well.

===Weapons===
{{See also|Falx|Sica}}
The weapon most associated with the Dacian forces that fought against Trajan<U+2019>s army during his invasions of Dacia was the [[falx]], a single-edged scythe-like weapon. The falx was able to inflict horrible wounds on opponents, easily disabling or killing the heavily armored Roman legionaries that they faced. This weapon, more so than any other single factor, forced the Roman army to adopt previously unused or modified equipment to suit the conditions on the Dacian battlefield.<ref>Schmitz (2005) 30</ref>

==Notable individuals==

{{See also|List of Dacian kings|Burebista|Decebalus|}}

This is a list of several important Dacian individuals or those of partly Dacian origin.
* [[Zalmoxis]], a semi-legendary social and religious reformer, eventually deified by the Getae and Dacians and regarded as [[Monotheism|the only true god]].
* [[Zoltes]]
* [[Burebista]] was a king of Dacia, 70<U+2013>44 BC, who united under his rule Thracians in a large territory, from today's [[Moravia]] in the West, to the [[Southern Bug]] river ([[Ukraine]]) in the East, and from the Northern [[Carpathian Mountains]] to Southern [[Dionysopolis]]. The Greeks considered him the first and greatest king of Thrace.{{sfn|Grumeza|2009|p=54}}{{better source|date=February 2014}}
* [[Decebalus]], a king of Dacia who was ultimately defeated by the forces of [[Trajan]].
* [[Diegis]] was a Dacian chief, general and brother of Decebalus, and his representative at the peace negotiations held with Domitian (89 CE)

==Legacy==
{{See also|Daco-Romanian|Daco-Romanian continuity|Dacia in art|Dacia in fiction}}
In 2004, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] was performed on the skeletal remains of Thracians from southeastern Romania dating from the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]]. MtDNA were compared with several modern mtDNA sequences from five present-day European populations. The results reflect a genetic similarity between the old Thracian individuals and the modern south-east European populations.{{sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246}}
The Thracian individuals show informative [[point mutations]] in 7np (nucleotide position), the Romanian, Greek and Albanian individuals in 7np, and the Bulgarian individuals in only 5np out of 12 most informative nucleotide positions presented in the study.{{sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246}} As concerns the frequency of point mutations in the 12 nucleotide positions, the Italian individuals show the highest mutation frequency with 12.5%, followed by the Thracian individuals with 8.3%, the Albanian individuals with 7.5%, the Romanian and Greek individuals with 6.25%, and the Bulgarian individuals with only 4.6%.{{sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246}}
Computing the frequency of common point mutations of the present-day European population with the Thracian population has indicated that the Italians (7.9%), the Albanians (6.3%) and the Greeks (5.8%) have a bias of closer genetic kinship with the Thracian individuals than the Romanian and Bulgarian individuals (only 4.2%).{{sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246}} The study concluds that, it can only be supposed, but cannot be proven that "the old Thracian populations contributed to the modern Romanian genetic pool."{{sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246}}
