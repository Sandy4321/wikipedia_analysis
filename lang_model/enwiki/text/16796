'''''Hamburger''''' is a [[compilation album]] by pop punk band, [[The Muffs]] released in [[2000 in music|2000]] by [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] (SFTRI).<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/release/782009 www.discogs.com/release/782009]</ref> It is a collection of singles, compilation appearances, outtakes, demos and covers spanning the band's entire career up to the time of its release.<ref>[http://www.taringa.net/posts/musica/869427/The-Muffs_---Hamburger-_1999_.html www.taringa.net/posts/musica/869427/The-Muffs_---Hamburger-_1999_.html]</ref>

The first three tracks make up some of The Muffs earliest material, recorded on a [[Multitrack recording|4-track]] in 1991. "New Love" and "I Don't Like You" come from the band's first release, the ''New Love'' single, issued on Sympathy for the Record Industry. "Guilty" and "Right In The Eye" come from their second singe released by [[Au Go Go Records]]. In 1992, The Muffs released "I Need You" b/w "Beat Your Heart Out" on the [[Sub Pop]] label. [[Courtney Love]] makes an appearance on the track "Love", rambling about a stolen dress.<ref>[http://www.antimusic.com/fucu/aom/2000/aug/muffs.shtml www.antimusic.com/fucu/aom/2000/aug/muffs.shtml]</ref>

The second appearance of "Right In The Eye" is an outtake from the 1993 self-titled [[The Muffs (album)|first album]] sessions. The demo of "Everywhere I Go" presented here, was used for the [[compact cassette|cassette]] version of the album only. Several demos are also included from the sessions for 1995s ''[[Blonder and Blonder]]''. "When I Was Down", "Sick Of You", "Become Undone", and "Goodnight Now" never made it to the album, but "I'm Confused" would be re-recorded for release. "[[Kids in America (Kim Wilde song)|Kids In America]]" originally appeared on the ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]] [[Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''. "I'm A Dick" was released as a single on SFTRI in 1996, prior to the release of ''Happy Birthday To Me'', where a new version would appear in 1997. "My Crazy Afternoon" would also be re-recorded for the album. [[C.C. DeVille]] makes a guest appearance on "Silly People" which would later be re-recorded for ''Alert Today, Alive Tomorrow''. "Do The Robot" features lead vocals by original drummer Criss Crass.
