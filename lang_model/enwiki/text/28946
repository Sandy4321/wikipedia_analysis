'''Samuel J. Tilden High School''' is a defunct New York City [[public high school]] in the [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] section of [[Brooklyn]].  It was named for [[Samuel J. Tilden]], the former governor of [[New York State]] and presidential candidate who, although carrying the popular vote, lost to [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in the [[Rutherford B. Hayes#Election of 1876|disputed election of 1876]].

In order to save the New York City government money during the [[Great Depression]], Samuel J. Tilden High School, [[Bayside High School (New York City)|Bayside High School]], [[Abraham Lincoln High School (New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]], [[John Adams High School (New York City)|John Adams High School]], [[Walton High School]], [[Andrew Jackson High School (Queens, New York)|Andrew Jackson High School]], and [[Grover Cleveland High School (New York City)|Grover Cleveland High School]] were all built from one set of blueprints.

==Early history==
Plans to construct Samuel J. Tilden High School were filed in 1927.  The construction of the school was estimated to cost between $2,500,000 and $3,000,000 and would feature specialized facilities including a swimming pool, rifle range, auditorium with a capacity of more than 1300, library, and science laboratories.<ref>Board of Education Approves Plans of Tilden High School," Brooklyn Eagle, Sept. 29 1927</ref> While the school was eventually constructed on Tilden Avenue and East 57th Street, residents in Brownsville, the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce, and Borough President James J. Bryne initially opposed the site because of poor transportation options around the location.<ref><U+201C>Board Reaffirms Tilden School Site, Deadlock Stands,<U+201D> Brooklyn Eagle, April 12, 1927</ref>

Shortly after the Board of Education decided on the location of Samuel J. Tilden High School, a formal recommendation was made to change the name of not-yet-built school to Edward B. Shallow High School.  This recommendation followed the death of [[Edward B. Shallow]], the Superintendent of the Board of Education who initially recommended a high school be named after New York State Governor, [[Samuel J. Tilden]].<ref><U+201C>Fight to Rename S.J. Tilden School,<U+201D> Brooklyn Eagle, May 8, 1927</ref>

Tilden High School opened on February 3, 1929.  It cost $2,500,000 to construct.  It was built to serve 3,969 students.<ref>"Plan Tilden H.S. Opening Feb. 3; Cost $2,500,000," Brooklyn Eagle, Dec. 21, 1929</ref>

In 1935, a field and stadium were designed and constructed with [[Works Progress Administration]] labor and appropriations.<ref>"Tilden High School Gets Stadium to Cost $15,000," Brooklyn Eagle, Oct 14, 1935</ref>  Several years later, the WPA would make another addition to the Samuel J. Tilden High School, this time in the form of a [[mural]] for the auditorium.  The project took nearly two years to complete, as muralist [[Abraham Lishinsky]], working with his colleague Irving A. Block, designed and painted a {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mural depicting <U+201C>Major Influences in Civilization<U+201D> for the auditorium.<ref><U+201C>Tilden to Get Civilization in Large Mural,<U+201D> Brooklyn Eagle, August 8, 1937</ref> Among the six assistants they employed over time was the artist Abram "Al" Lerner.<ref>Oral history interview with Irving Block, 1965 Apr. 16, Smithsonian Institution, Archives of American Art</ref>

By the 1940s, Tilden H.S., initially criticized for its difficult-to-reach location, was overcrowded. At one point 5,700 students attended.  In order to limit the crowding, S.J. Tilden administrators split the school day offering one session from 7:50am to 1:04pm and another from 1:11pm to 5:45pm.<ref>"As but one of 21 packed schools," Brooklyn Eagle, Nov. 18, 1941</ref>

==Tilden High School during World War II==
In 1942, Samuel J. Tilden H.S. was the first Brooklyn high school to hold a mass blood drive.<ref>"135 at Tilden to Donate Blood Friday," Brooklyn Eagle, May 17, 1942</ref>  This was one of many ways that [[World War II]] affected students at Tilden.  During the war, new home economics curricula were introduced to better prepare girls for the war effort.  Girls took cooking classes that taught them how to cook more with less, as everyday ingredients were rationed and shipped off to soldiers.  There were no food surpluses, and soldiers were the main priority at the time.<ref><U+201C>Boro School Pushes Basic Food Ideas,<U+201D> Brooklyn Eagle, December 4, 1942</ref>

Other students supported the war by purchasing more than $15,000 in United States Savings Bonds and Stamps (see [[war bond]]s) to help the government finance military operations, leading the nation in money raised by students.<ref><U+201C>Tilden Pupils buy $15,000 Defense Stamps,<U+201D> Brooklyn Eagle, January 6, 1942</ref>  Over 100 girls knit sweaters and scarves in conjunction with the [[British War Relief Fund]] and [[American Red Cross]].  The Red Cross also agreed to send instructors to teach nursing and first aid methods; if the war were to last long enough, the girls would become nurses-in-aid to care for wounded soldiers.

==Tilden and the Red Scare==
During the 1940s and 1950s, individuals and organizations all over the United States were accused of affiliations with [[socialists]], [[communists]], and [[Political radicalism|radicals]].  At Tilden High School, students and teachers were accused of radicalism.  Even the then principal Dr. Abraham Lefkowitz was accused of being a radical for distributing a statement to teachers and students that denounced complete free enterprise and called upon students to think critically about their role in America.<ref>"Teacher Denies Critics<U+2019> Charge of Radicalism," Brooklyn Eagle, Oct. 28 1945</ref>

Students were also affected by the [[Red Scare]] and were warned by administrators that affiliation with Communist-linked clubs such as the [[Young Communist League, USA|American Youth for Democracy]] would adversely affect their future careers.<ref>"Shun Youth Group, Students Warned," Brooklyn Eagle, October 10, 1947</ref>

During testimony before the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security]], a former student claimed that both Mr. Eugene Jackson, a language teacher at Tilden, and Mr. Terry Rosenbaum had expressed sympathy toward student Red groups.  The former student alleged that an American Youth for Democracy unit at school was asking to obtain speakers for the unit<U+2019>s meetings. Apparently, Mr. Jackson told them that he agreed with their point of view and thought it was very good.<ref><U+201C>Two Accused Teachers on Tilden Staff," Brooklyn Eagle, August 13, 1952</ref>

By the late 1940s, students had to pledge an [[loyalty oath|oath of loyalty]] to the United States and [[State of New York]] in order to receive a diploma.  The oath read as follows:

<U+201C>I hereby declare my loyalty to the Constitution and Government of the United States and the State of New York and promise to support their laws.<U+201D><ref>"Youth Wins Diploma Despite Refusal of Loyalty Oath to U.S.," Brooklyn Eagle, Feb 4, 1948</ref>

==Tilden High School and Integration==
The racial tensions that swept the nation during the 1960s and 1970s were felt at Samuel J. Tilden High School as well.  The school<U+2019>s African American population was growing. The school<U+2019>s demographics were changing; Tilden High School was becoming more diverse.  In 1962, of the 5,000 students that attended Tilden HS, 97.9% were Jewish and Italian. By 1971, of the 3,000 students at Tilden, 63.4% were <U+201C>others<U+201D>, the Board of Education<U+2019>s term for non-blacks and non-Puerto Ricans. Changing demographics and under-enrollment set the stage for controversy around rezoning and plans for Samuel J. Tilden HS.<ref><U+201C>Tilden H.S. Reflects A changing Brooklyn," Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 19, 1972</ref>

Tensions came to a head during the March 1972 hearings on rezoning the catchment areas for three Brooklyn high schools. The hearings aimed to assure an [[Racial integration|integrated]] education in Samuel J. Tilden High School, [[Canarsie High School]], and [[South Shore High School (Brooklyn)|South Shore High School]].  Parents groups linked to each high school had their own ideas for a zoning plan that would preserve the racial and ethnic diversity of each school while maintaining a quality education for every student.<ref>"300 Demonstrators Back Tilden School Zone Plan," Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 14, 1972.</ref>

A number of Tilden High School students prepared a flier in which they outlined their position regarding the rezoning. They wanted to preserve an ethnic balance in the school but wanted to avoid a result in which the majority of students were nonwhite. The students who prepared the flier were concerned that if the ethnic balance were to tip too much, "an unfortunate chain of events [would take] place: white families [would flee] the neighborhood." The school and the surrounding neighborhood would no longer remain integrated. The result would be "another segregated school, another segregated neighborhood.<U+201D><ref>"PTAs Offer Rezone Alternative," John Belmonte, NY Daily News, March 9, 1972</ref>

In order to attract students, specialized honors programs were established with Samuel J. Tilden High School.  Students from all over the city would be able to apply to the special programs.  This marked a shift in New York City School zoning, as a student<U+2019>s school options were no longer only determined by geography.<ref>"Brooklyn to get Special Schools," Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 26, 1972</ref>

==A Changing East Flatbush, A Changing Tilden==
Tilden High School's demographics continued to change into the 1970s and 1980s paralleling changes in the surrounding neighborhood, East Flatbush. The neighborhood saw increased immigration from the Caribbean.  Media coverage of Samuel J. Tilden also changed, with a focus on incidents of violence.  Although crime had become a problem in East Flatbush, the media coverage prompted the then principal Everett Kerner to state that the high school was getting a "bum rap.<U+201D><ref>"Principal defends Tilden High; says it got <U+2018>bum rap,<U+2019><U+201D> Jaren McCallister & Paul Meskil, Daily News, April 4, 1984</ref>

==Athletics==
When it opened in 1929, Principal John M. Loughran adopted the slogan, <U+201C>athletics for all.<U+201D><ref>"Tilden High Plans for Big Spot in Sports," James. J Murphy, Feb. 5, 1930</ref> Equipped with facilities, sports field, three gymnasiums, swimming pool, etc., Principal Loughran set to find the personnel and coaches that would establish Tilden High Blue and Greys as an athletic power in New York City.

The sports program hit its first obstacle 1934 as the faculty moved to change the baseball and football teams from inter-school competitive programs to intramurals in efforts to better distribute the school budget while balancing school spirit.<ref><U+201C>Football and Baseball at Tilden May Give Way to Intra-Murals" James J. Murchay, Jan. 1934</ref>

In 1935, a new stadium was constructed and designed by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].  This new facility and the gyms inside the building were made available to adults in the community several years earlier during evenings, with separate times for men and women.<ref>"Adults Attracted to New Athletic Center at Tilden," Brooklyn Eagle, Oct. 13, 1931</ref>

The Tilden Blue and Grey won a number of [[Public Schools Athletic League]] titles in football, baseball, tennis, track, swimming, and fencing.

During the summer of 1987, teacher and Dean of students Joanne Belinksy became the 6th woman in history to run {{convert|3000|mi|km}} across the country.<ref>:Educator Hits the road <U+2013> all 3,000 Miles of It," Bill Stuttig, Daily News, July 10, 1987</ref>

==Small schools==
In 2006, the Department of Education declared Samuel J. Tilden High School to be a failed school.<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-04-03/art/small-order/ Village Voice 2007-04-03] Tilden High shutting its doors</ref>  In 2007 it became the Tilden Educational Complex, home to several new, separate [[Small schools movement|small schools]].  These include the Cultural Academy for the Arts and Sciences (CAAS), [[the Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School]], and It Takes A Village Academy (ITAVA).  With the growth of the new schools, Samuel J. Tilden High School was finally phased out in June, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tildenmemories.com/ |title=Samuel J.
