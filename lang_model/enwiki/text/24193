The '''Midland Railway''' is a [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]] headquartered in [[Baldwin City, Kansas]].

It was chartered in 1982 to find an abandoned [[railroad]] line to operate. Midland purchased the line from Baldwin City to [[Ottawa, Kansas]] from the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] in 1987, and began running excursion trains on part of the line later that year. Total length of the line is 11 miles (17.7&nbsp;km).

Midland operates a demonstration historic railroad, and its mission is to "educate the public about the role railroading played, and continues to play, in the commercial, social, and cultural life of America's Heartland." Midland's base of operations is the depot built in 1906 by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] at 1515 High Street in Baldwin City. This building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983. Midland has received two matching federal grants to rebuild [[rail tracks|track]]. Private grants have and are being used to rebuild railroad equipment. Starting in 2004, excursion trains are run all the way from Baldwin City to Ottawa.

The regular operating season runs from [[Memorial Day]] (last Monday of May) to October 31 ([[Halloween]]). Special events and fairs are held at various times through the year. Weekend [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] camps are held in the spring and fall. Midland's Scout program is one of the few in the country to offer a railroading merit badge.
