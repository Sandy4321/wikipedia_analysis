'''Vadama''' ({{lang-ta|<U+0BB5><U+0B9F><U+0BAE><U+0BBE>}}) meaning "Northerners" are a sub-sect of the [[Iyer]] community of Tamil [[Brahmins]]. While some believe that their name is an indication of the fact that they were the most recent Brahmin migrants to the [[Sangam period|Tamil country]] others interpret the usage of the term "Vadama" as a reference to their strict adherence to the [[Sanskrit language]] and Vedic rituals which are of northerly origin . It may also be possible that Vadamas may be Brahmins whose origins lie in the Dravida region of northern Tamil Nadu. Like other Iyer communities, they follow the ''[[Advaita]]'' philosophy propounded by [[Adi Shankara]].  A significant proportion of the Vadama community adopted [[Vaishnavism]], and are thus believed to have given rise to the [[Vadagalai Iyengar]] community. The oldest historical references to Vadamas date from the first millennium AD. A large number of Vadamas migrated to [[Kerala]] during the [[medieval period]], so that Vadamas along with the [[Brahacharnam]] form the majority of the [[Kerala Iyer]] community. A section of the Vadama community also migrated north to the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] country and [[Maharashtra]] where they were known as "[[Dravid (Surname)|Dravidas]]".

Vadamas have a [[wikt:martial|martial]] tradition unlike most other Iyer communities. They are believed to have been the protectors of Brahmin villages or ''[[agraharams]]'' and served as administrators and advisors to [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Telugu people|Telugu]] kings during the medieval and early modern period.

==Etymology of the term==
The term Vadama may have originated from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term 'Vadakku' meaning North, indicating the Northern origin of the Vadama Brahmins.<ref>"South Indian Studies", Harogadde Manappa Nayak, Balakrishnan Raja Gopal, T. V. Mahalingam, Geetha Book House, 1990</ref> This claim is supported by the fact that, unlike other subsects of [[Iyers]], some Vadama pay oblations in their daily [[Sandhyavandanam]] to the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in Central India.<ref>"Journal of the Asiatic Society", India Asiatic Society, 1832</ref> However, what is not certain is whether 'North' refers to northern Tamil Nadu/Southern Deccan, or regions farther north. Other scholars are of the opinion that rather than the superficial indication of a northern origin for the people, the term ''"vadama"'' would rather refer to proficiency in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic]] ritual, generally associated with the north prior to the first millennium A. D.<ref>"Peasant state and society in medieval South India", Burton Stein, Oxford University Press, 1980</ref><ref name="Swami Sivananda">[http://www.dlshq.org/download/hinduismbk.htm#_VPID_74 All About Hinduism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Sub-categories==
 
Vadamas are further sub-divided into five categories

*  Vadadesa Vadama (''Vadamas of the northern country'')<ref name="castesandtribes_p334">[[#Castes and Tribes of Southern India|Castes and Tribes of Southern India]], Pg 334</ref>
* Choladesa Vadama<ref>"Caste in Indian Politics", R.

* Injee<ref name="Swami Sivananda"/><ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /> and
* Thummagunta Dravida.<ref name="castesandtribes_p334" />

Intermarriage with other Iyer sects has been increasing in recent times, while earlier, most marriages were arranged only within the same subsect of Vadama. Such a degree of exclusion has become rather uncommon now. Exceptions did exist, such as the marriage of Kurratalwan's sons(Considered to be Vadama followers of Sri Vaishnavism), which took place outside the Vadama fold.<ref name="iyengarvadamakuratalwan">[http://www.srivaishnavan.com/tomcat/visnu.html Srivaishnavism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==

Some historians hold that all Brahmins who migrated to the far-south during and after the age of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Emperors]], came to be classified as Vadama.<ref>"History of Tamilnad", N. Subrahmanian, Koodal Publishers, Tamil Nadu, 1977</ref>

===First millennium A.D.===

There is  a  perception that some Kashmir-linked Vadama settled in [[Tirunelveli]] between 750 and 800 AD. An interesting fact corroborating this migration may be had from the treatise called ''[[Natyashastra]]'' written by Bharata Muni, held by some to have been from Kashmir and by others to be from the south, formed the basis of the dance-form [[Bharatanatyam]] which is particularly associated with Tamil Nadu.<ref name="kashart">[http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/wonder.pdf Art and Culture in Ancient Kashmir<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Art Historians such as Vasundhara Filliozat claim that there are inscriptional evidences to prove the continuous migration of teachers from Kashmir to South.<ref name="kashart" /> Such scholars also state that some other South Indian Saivaite and Tantric traditions were also introduced by teachers from Kashmir.<ref name="kashart" />

It appears that the Sabhaiyar group of the Vadama, were present in the [[Chola Empire]] in the 9th century, since the grant of the "entire village of Chirri[dai]yarru excluding the ''kani'' of Samgappadi-kilan was made to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirumalpperu as a tax-free ''devadana'' in the 21st year [892 A.D.] of the reign of [[Chola]] [[Aditya I]] and the administration of the charity was entrusted to the ''sabhaiyar'' of Puduppakkam in Purisanadu".<ref>[http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_22/part_1/introduction.html What Is India News Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Second millennium===

====11th to the 14th century====

The [[Srivaishnava]] hold that their guru [[Ramanujacharya]], born in the first quarter of the 11th century,<ref name="Sastri"/> was a Vadama by birth.

====14th and 15th centuries====

Instability prevailed in Peninsular India in the aftermath of the defeat of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]]s of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Deogiri]] and [[Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]] in the early 14th century by the [[Tughlaq]]s. In response to the Moslem irruptions the Kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] was founded in 1336, and came to be locked in an existential struggle with the [[Bahmani]] Sultanate from 1347 to 1490, when the Moslem state broke up. This early period was marked by much strife, especially in the ''[[jehad]]s'' of [[Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah]] (1397<U+2013>1422) and his brother [[Ahmad Shah I Wali]] (1422<U+2013>1435), when thousands of Hindus, especially Brahmins, were enslaved and temples of the northern Deccan desecrated.<ref name="Sastri">'A History of South India from Pre-historic Times to the Fall of Vijayanagar', [[K. A. Nilakanta Sastri]], Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 1975</ref> The oppression was also felt in the eastern peninsula as far as the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] where, for instance in 1478, [[Muhammad Shah III]] ''Lashkari'' (1463<U+2013>1482) demolished the Great Temple of [[Kondavid]]u and was acclaimed as a ''[[Ghazw|ghazi]]'', for personally decapitating all the Brahmins.<ref name='Sastri' /> Such excesses induced Brahmins to seek refuge in the realms of Vijayanagar, where many were appointed ''[[karnam]]s'' ([[bailiffs]]) in preference to other castes, from the reign of [[Harihara I]] (1336<U+2013>1357) onward.<ref name="Sastri"/>

====Early 16th century====

After the division of the [[Bahmani]] Sultanate in 1490, into the Sultanates of [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]], [[Golconda]], [[Ahmadnagar]] and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]], the armies of Vijayanagar were successful in fending of invasions and restricting the Sultanates to Central India, especially in the reign of [[Krishnadeva Raya]] (1509<U+2013>1529), who also began the practice of appointing Brahmins commanders of strategically important forts.<ref name="Sastri"/>

====16th and 17th centuries====

Relative peace prevailed until the [[Battle of Talikota]], in 1565, when [[Rama Raya]] of Vijayanagar was killed and the capital city razed to the ground. The land, in addition to being plundered by the combined armies of the Sultanates, came to be oppressed by renegade ''[[polygar]]s'' and bandits whose rise commenced with the destruction of the central power.<ref name="Sastri"/> The [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]] invasion of Peninsular India and the depredations of the Deccan by the Mahrattas under [[Shivaji]] also began early in the 17th century.

A combination of these belligerent powers and the desolation they helped create appears to have made the relative peace offered in the far south of the country under the Hindu kings of [[Travancore]], [[Madurai Nayaks|Madurai]], [[Tanjore Nayaks|Tanjore]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], far more desirable and induced many Hindus to migrate there. A fact supporting this idea, we have from English chroniclers in the 17th century, who state that their procurement of goods along the Western [[Konkan|Concan]] and [[Canara]] coasts, suffered severely after the Mogul invasions and the mass depopulation of the peninsula they caused.<ref name="Hamilton">"A New Account of the East Indies", Captain Alexander Hamilton, published 1739, A. Bettesworth and C. Hitch, London</ref> Another statement often encountered in their annals is that the economic growth of the factory at [[Fort St. George]], [[Madras]] was in a large measure attributable to the fact that many people chose to settle there to escape the chaotic conditions farther north.<ref name="Hamilton"/> When we consider, in conjunction with these two facts, Fort St. George's position as a newly-established, well-fortified and growing settlement in Aurangzeb's time, and therefore a secure refuge, a mass exodus southwards seems to have occurred in the period in question. 

The relatives and family members of [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], a Vadadesa Vadama, believed that they were descended from  Brahmins of the [[Desh]] region of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] who migrated to [[Chittoor]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]] from where they migrated to the northern part of Tamil Nadu in the 16th century where they were granted the village of [[Chetpet]] by a local chieftain.<ref name="cpp7">[[#Sir C. P. Remembered|Sir C. P. Remembered]], Pg 7</ref>

====17th century to the present====

During the 19th century, the Vadamas along with other [[Tamil Brahmins]] made ample use of the opportunities provided by British rule to dominate the civil services, legislature and the judiciary in the [[Madras Presidency]]. Throughout the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century there was intense political rivalry between the Vadamas and the Brahacharanams for the domination of Brahmin villages called ''agraharams''.<ref name="classp89">{{cite book|title=Caste and class: dynamics of inequality in Indian society |author=R. Jayaraman|pages=89|year=1981}}</ref>

==Communities related to the Vadamas==
{{See|Aaraama Dravidulu|Ashtagrama Iyer}}

===Iyengar communities===

The Vaishnavite spiritual leader [[Ramanuja]] is generally believed to have been born a Vadama. Under his tutelage, numerous Vadamas adopted Vaishnavism and are believed to have given rise to the Vadakalai Iyengar community.<ref name="castesandtribes_p334" /><ref name="tamilbrahminp176">{{cite book|title=The brahmin in the Tamil country|pages=176|author=N.

=== Gurukkal Brahmins ===

Some of the [[Gurukkal]] in temples in Tamil Nadu, are Vadama, though not recognised as such by the community, since they have certain practices that are prohibited for the Vadama.<ref name="Swami Sivananda"/>

There is also evidence that some South Indian brahmins settled in Kashmir. The actual sect of their origin is not known.<ref name="kasdravids">http://vitasta.org/2001/1.6.html This website references [[Kalhana]]'s [[Rajatarangini]] which says that some Dravid Brahmins were settled at Sempora when Raja [[Jaya Simha]] (1128-1149) ruled over Kashmir</ref>

=== Aarama Dravidulu ===

There is a perception that the ancestors of some Aarama Dravidulu Brahmins of [[Andhra Pradesh]] migrated in the 13th and 14th centuries, from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] to the banks of the River [[Cauvery]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], whence some of them migrated to Andhra Pradesh, by all accounts before the 18th century.<ref>http://www.vepachedu.org/manasanskriti/aaraamadraavida.html  This reference quotes "Aaraamadraavida Vamsacharitra," written (1935) by Anantapadmanaabham Dvivedula (1888-1947), published by Venkataramarao Dvivedula, Samkhavaram, Andhra Pradesh - 533446.</ref>

==Traditional occupation==

Administrative practices adopted by them were strictly in accordance with those prescribed in the Hindu Dharma-Shastras, as may be observed from the records of the kings themselves.

But, as with other Brahmins, their primary duties were to study the Vedas, teach them and perform the ceremonies they entailed. The vast majority of them, until the 19th century, were household priests with some even being temple-priests, particularly in Travancore.

Many were great scholars and served in the courts of kings. Nilakanta Dikshitar was a minister to Thirumalai Nayak of Madurai.<ref name="indianreviewp186">{{cite book|title=The Modern review, Volume 62|pages=186|author=Ramananda Chatterjee|publisher=Prabasi Press Pvt. Ltd.}}</ref>

In the 19th century, as with other [[Iyers]], many of the Vadama joined, the judiciary of [[British India]] as lawyers and judges, or served in the [[Indian Civil Service|Indian Civil]] and [[Indian Revenue Service|Revenue Services]]. Many others continued in the service of the kings of the princely states of [[Travancore]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [[Pudukottai]], and [[Ramanathapuram|Ramnad]].<ref>"From Landlords to Software Engineers: Migration and Urbanization among

==Religious practices==
{{double image|left|Gopichandanam1.jpg|100|Gopichandanam2.jpg|100|The crescent or U-mark applied with the Gopichandanam is mostly used as [[caste mark]] by the Vadamas}}

While the religious rituals of the Vadama are, in almost all respects, identical with those of other [[Iyers]], there are a few minor deviations from them. One of these lies in the practice of some men applying ''Gopi Chandanam'', an yellow pigment of mineral origin similar in appearance to that obtained from sandalwood, on the forehead, instead of ''[[Vibhuti|Vibhuthi]]''. However, others like [[Appayya Dikshitar]]'s family applied only Vibhuti, being staunch devotees of [[Shiva]]. While it was more common in former times, the use of Gopi Chandanam continues, being replaced by Vibhuthi otherwise. Some Vadamas also sported the Vaishnavite ''namam''. They were known as ''kutthunamakarar''.

The Vadama traditionally claim to be superior to other classes of Iyers.<ref>"Tanjore District Handbook", Madras Record Office, Madras, India, 1957</ref> One ritualistic difference from other Iyers, arises in their having to recite the following verse in honour of the River [[Narmada River|Narmada]], and to ward of serpents, as part of their [[Sandhyavandanam]]:

:''Narmadayai namah pratah Narmadayai namo nisi''
:''Namostu Narmade tubhyam pahi mam visa-sarpatah''<ref>[http://www.kamakoti.org/hindudharma/part6/chap11.htm Vedic Vocalisation and the Regional Languages from the Chapter "Siksa", in Hindu Dharma : kamakoti.org:<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Also, in some parts of  Kerala, as [[Nambudiri]] [[Brahmacharya|Brahmacharis]] were not commonly found,<ref>[http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/faq/index.htm Frequently Asked Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a Brahmachari belonging to the Vadadesa Vadama was required to pour water into the hands of a Nambudiri [[sanyasi]] as part of the rituals connected with the latter's breakfast.<ref>"Castes and Tribes of South India", [[Edgar Thurston]] and K. Rangachari, Government Press, 1909</ref>

Vadamas have also significantly contributed towards popularizing and propagating the worship of Lord Shiva and Devi.<ref name="avadayakkal">{{cite news | last= | first=  | title= A Kali Yuga woman saint  | date=November 30, 2003 | url =http://chennaionline.com/musicnew/Devotional/aavadai.asp | work =Chennai Online | accessdate = 2008-09-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080503082723/http://www.chennaionline.com/musicnew/Devotional/aavadai.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-03}}
