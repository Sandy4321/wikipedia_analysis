[[File:CincinnatiCustomsHouse.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] [[Customs House]] {{circa}} 1850<U+2013>60<br>Governments were one of the earliest users of weights and measures <U+2013> often for the purpose of tax collection.  In the United States the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] rather than [[United States Congress|Congress]] took the lead in establishing a standard [[system of weights and measures]].]]
The '''imperial and US customary systems of measurement''' are two closely inter-related systems of measurement. They are both derived from the [[English units|English system of measurement units]] which can be traced back to [[Ancient Roman units of measurement]], and [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure. US Customary units, developed and used in the United States after the [[American Revolution]], are based on a subset of the English units used in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], while the Imperial system of units was developed and used after 1824 in the United Kingdom and subsequently used in the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. US Customary units are the predominant system of units in the United States, but in all Commonwealth countries the [[metric system]] has, to varying degrees, replaced the imperial system.

Most of the units of measure have been adopted in one way or another since the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066). The units of linear measure have changed the least <U+2013> the [[yard]] (which replaced the [[ell]]) and the [[chain (unit)|chain]] were measures derived in England.  The [[foot (unit)|foot]] used by craftsman supplanted the foot used in agriculture which was reduced in size by a factor of {{fract|10|11}} to bring it into alignment. This resulted in there being {{fract|16|1|2}} feet in a [[Rod (unit)|rod, pole or perch]] instead of 15 agricultural feet.  The [[furlong]] and the [[acre]], once it became a unit of the size of a piece of land rather than its value, remained relatively unchanged. In the last thousand years, three principal pound were used in England. The [[troy pound]] (5760 [[grain (unit)|grains]]) was used for precious metals, the [[Apothecaries' system|apothecaries' pound]], (also 5760 grains) was used by [[pharmacist]]s and the [[avoirdupois pound]] (7000 grains) was used for general purposes. The apothecaries and troy pounds are divided into 12 ounces (of 480 grains) while the avoirdupois pound has 16 ounces (of 437.5 grains). The unit of volume, the [[gallon]], has different values in the United States and in the United Kingdom <U+2013> the US fluid gallon being about 0.83 imperial gallons and the US dry gallon being about 0.89 imperial gallons.

Both systems of measure were widely used in [[mechanical engineering]], though not in [[electrical engineering]]. Some units of measure such as the [[horsepower]] or the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) have special names but by and large unit names are generated from their constituent components <U+2013> for example, [[pounds per square inch]].  In contrast, the [[metric system]] has a special name for pressure<U+2014>the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]].

After the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] the units of measurement in the [[United States]] developed into what is now known as [[United States customary units|customary units]]. The United Kingdom overhauled its system of measurement in 1824, when it introduced the [[imperial units|imperial system of units]]. This resulted in both countries having different gallons. Later in the century, efforts were made to align the definition of the [[pound (avoirdupois)|pound]] and the [[yard]] in both countries by using copies of the standards adopted by the British Parliament in 1855. However, these standards were of poor quality compared with those produced for the [[Convention of the Metre]]. In 1960 both countries agreed to common definitions of the yard and the pound based on definitions of the [[metre]] and the [[kilogram]]. This change, which amounted to a few parts per million, had little effect in the United Kingdom, but resulted in the United States having two slightly different systems of linear measure <U+2013> the international system, and the surveyors system.

[[File:Aethelstan.jpg|thumb|120px|Silver penny of Aethelstan (924-939) from which the name ''[[pennyweight]]'' (dwt) was derived]]

English units of measure, were derived from a combination of [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]], [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolignian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure.  They were a precursor to both the [[Imperial units|Imperial system of units]] (first defined in 1824) and [[United States customary units]] which evolved from English Units from 1776 onwards.<ref name=Smoot/>

The earliest records of English units of measure relate to [[Saxons|Saxon]] coinage <U+2013> at that time coins were both weights and currency.  The penny introduced by [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] was about 20 grains (1.296&nbsp;g). [[Edward the Elder]] increased the weight of the English [[penny]] to 26 grains (1.685&nbsp;g), thereby aligning it with the penny of [[Charlemagne]], but by the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest]] (1066), it has decreased to 24 grains (1.555&nbsp;g).  This value was subsequently called the ''[[pennyweight]]'' and formed the basis of the [[Troy weight|Troy units of weight]]<U+2014>the [[troy ounce]] being used to this day for weighting precious metals.<ref name=McGreevy/>{{rp|44<U+2013>48}} In 965&nbsp;AD, [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] decreed "that only one weight and one measure should pass throughout the King's dominion".<ref>{{cite book

During Saxon times land was described in both terms of its economic value and in terms of an absolute size. In the [[Domesday Book]], the [[Hide (unit)|hide]], an economic unit of measure was used, while there are references elsewhere relating to the furlong and to the rood that appear to be related to ploughing procedures. Of particular interest was the rood which was 15 [North German or Saxon] feet in length, the North German foot being equivalent to 335&nbsp;mm (13.2&nbsp;inches).<ref name=McGreevy/>{{rp|50}} Craftsmen, on the other hand used a shorter Roman foot.

During the medieval era agricultural products, apart from wool, were mostly sold by volume, with various [[bushel]]s and [[gallon]]s being introduced over the years for different commodities. In the early fourteenth century the wool trade traditionally used the [[avoirdupois]] system of weights, a process that was formalized by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1340.

During the [[Tudor period]], numerous reforms were made to English weights and measures.

The 1824 Act also introduced some changes to the administration of the standards of weights and measures: previously Parliament had been given the custody of the standards but the act passed this responsibility on to the [[Exchequer]]. The act also set up an inspectorate for weights and measures.<ref name=1824Act/><ref name=Poppy/>

The standard yard and pound were lost in 1834 when a fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard was a pound avoirdupois. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.<ref name=MacLean>{{cite conference

Under the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 custody of the standard yard and pound and custody of the administration of weights and measures was entrusted to the [[Exchequer]] but verification was administered locally. The 1835 Act formally described the office and duties of Inspectors of Weights and Measures and required every borough to appoint such officers and the 1866 Act passed responsibility for weights and measures to the [[Board of Trade]]. In 1900 the Board of Trade established the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) to provide laboratory facilities for weights and measures.<ref name=Poppy/>

After the passage of the 1897 Act, weights and measures in the United Kingdom remained relatively unchanged until after the [[Second World War]]. By the middle of the century the difference of 2 parts per million between the British and US standard yards was causing problems<U+2014>in 1900 a tolerance of 10 parts per million was adequate for science, but by 1950 this tolerance had shrunk to 0.25 parts per million.<ref name=McGreevy/>{{rp|155}} In 1960 representatives from the NPL and other national laboratories from the United States and Commonwealth agreed to redefine the yard as being exactly 0.9144&nbsp;metres, an action that was ratified by the British Government as part of the 1963 Weights and Measures Act.

[[Metrication in the United Kingdom]] began in the mid-1960s. Initially this metrication was voluntary and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued to be used in the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer.<ref>{{Cite legislation UK

During the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress of the United States]] in 1789, [[Thomas Jefferson]] was detailed to draw up a plan for the currency and weights of measures that would be used in the new republic. In his [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|response]] in 1790 he noted that the existing system of measure was sound but that control of the base artefact was not under the control of the United States. His report suggested a means of manufacturing a local standard and also left the way open for an adoption of a decimal-based system should this be appropriate.<ref name=Jefferson>{{cite web

[[File:Bushel Table of States.jpg|thumb|250px|Ninetennth century list of various bushels by state and commodity]]
Throughout the nineteenth century individual states developed their own standards and in particular a variety of bushels based on weight (mass) rather than volume emerged, dependent on both commodity and state.  This lack of uniformity crippled inter-state trade and in 1905 the National Bureau of Standards called a meeting of the states to discuss the lack of uniform standards and in many cases, a means of regulatory oversight. A meeting was held the following year and subsequently became an annual gathering known as the [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] (NCWM).  In 1915 the conference published its first model standards.<ref name="OurHistory"/>  The bushel was not fully standardized and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] still (May 2013) uses different bushels for different commodities<U+2014>a bushel of [[Maize|corn]] being 56&nbsp;lb, a bushel of [[oat]]s 38&nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[soybean]]s 60&nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[Winter wheat|red winter wheat]] (both hard and soft) also 60&nbsp;lb.  Other commodities at the exchange are reckoned in pounds, in short tons or in metric tons.<ref>{{cite web

During the twentieth century the principal change in the customary system of weights and measures was an agreement between NIST and the corresponding bodies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, signed in 1960, that redefined the yard and the pound in terms of the metre and the kilogram respectively.  These new units became known as the international yard and pound. Congress has neither endorsed nor repudiated this action. (See [[#Metric equivalents]]).

Imperial and US customary units have long been used in many branches of engineering. 
Two of the earliest such units of measure to come into use where the ''[[horsepower]]'' and the [[Fahrenheit|''degree Fahrenheit'']].

In 1777 the [[Royal Society]], under the chairmanship of [[Henry Cavendish]], proposed the definition of the Fahrenheit scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32&nbsp;<U+00B0>F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212&nbsp;<U+00B0>F.

In 1873 a committee of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] under the chairmanship of [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] introduced the concept of a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherence]] into units of measure and proposed the names [[dyne]] and [[erg]] as the units of [[force]] and [[Work (physics)|work]] in the [[Centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second system of units|CGS system of units]].<ref>{{cite journal

Since all the constants in these relationships is unity, the units are said to be [[coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]].</ref> Two years later [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], older brother of William Thomson introduced the term [[poundal]] as a coherent unit of force in the [[Foot<U+2013>pound<U+2013>second system]] (FPS) of measurement.<ref>{{OED|poundal}}</ref> The equivalent FPS unit of work was the [[foot-poundal]].<ref>{{cite book

Other systems for the measurement of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the [[British Gravitational System]] (BG) proposed by [[Arthur Mason Worthington]] and the [[English Engineering Units|English Engineering System]] (EE). Both systems depend on the [[gravitational acceleration]], and use the [[pound-force]] as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a [[SI base unit|base unit]] while the [[slug]] is a derived unit of [[inertia]] (rather than mass).<ref>{{cite book

Both these approaches led to slight variations in the meaning of the pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) in different parts of the word.  Various countries published standard values that should be used for ''g'' and in 1901 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] published a standard value for ''g'' that should be used in the "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (32.174&nbsp;ft/s<sup>2</sup>) which is equal to the value of ''g'' at 45<U+00B0> latitude.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:StandardYardEnd.jpg|thumb|End of the Standard yard of 1855 showing the gold plugs which bore the markings for the standard yard]]
The standard yard and [Troy] pound were lost in 1834 when a [[Burning of Parliament|fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster]]. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard, made of platinum, was a pound avoirdupois. The new yard, slightly longer than a yard to prevent wear as was experienced with the ''[[m<U+00E8>tre des Archives]]'', was made of brass and had two gold plugs close to its end. Scratch marks on the plugs denoted the length of the yard. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard and avoirdupois pound (known in the United States as the "Mint pound") was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.<ref name=MacLean/>

In the years that followed the passing of the 1878 Act, the standard imperial yard was found to be shrinking at a rate, confirmed in 1950, to be nearly one part per million every 30 years.<ref>{{cite news

The definition of units of weight above a pound differed between the customary and the imperial system - the imperial system employed the stone of 14&nbsp;pounds, the hundredweight of 8&nbsp;stone<ref group=Note>In this context, the plural is "stone", not "stones"</ref> and the ton of 2240&nbsp;pounds (20 hundredweight), while the customary system of units did not employ the stone but has a hundredweight of 100&nbsp;pounds and a ton of 2000&nbsp;pounds.  In international trade, the pound of 2240&nbsp;pounds was often referred to as the "long ton" and the ton of 2000&nbsp;pounds as the "short ton".  When using customary units, it is usual to express [[body weight]] in pounds, but when using imperial units,  to use [[Stone (unit)|stones and pounds]].<ref>{{cite web

In his ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]], then [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], identified 14 different gallons in English statutes varying in size from 224 to 282 cubic inches (3.67 to 4.62 litres).<ref name=Jefferson/> In 1832, in the absence of any direction by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] chose the second smallest gallon, the "Queen Anne gallon" of 231 cubic inches (3.785 litres) to be the official gallon in the United States for fiscal purposes. Sixteen US fluid ounces make a US pint (8 pints equals 1 gallon in both customary and imperial systems). During the reform of Weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom in 1824, old gallons were replaced by the new imperial gallon which was defined to be the volume to 10 pounds of water at 62&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (17&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) and determined experimentally to be 277.42 cubic inches (4.546 litres).  Twenty imperial fluid ounces make an imperial pint, the imperial fluid ounce being 0.96 US fluid ounces.

The US Customary system of units makes use of set of dry units of capacity that have a similar set of names<ref group = Note>NIST does not catalogue a "dry gallon" in its list of US units of measure.</ref> to those of liquid capacity, though different volumes - the dry pint having a volume of 33.6 cubic inches (550&nbsp;ml) against the US fluid pint's volume of 28.875 cubic inches (473&nbsp;ml) and the imperial pint of 34.68 cubic inches (568&nbsp;ml).  The imperial system of measure does not have an equivalent to the US customary system of "dry measure".

In the international commodities markets, the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] ({{gaps|42|US|gallons}}, ~159&nbsp;litres) is used in both London and New York/Chicago for trading in crude oil and the [[troy ounce]] (~31.10&nbsp;grams) for trading in precious metals, otherwise the London markets use metric units and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] uses customary units.

Prior to metrication, the units of measure used in the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]  were the same as those used in the United Kingdom while those used in the [[British Commonwealth]] and in [[South Africa]] were in most cases a subset of those used in the United Kingdom with, in certain cases, local differences.

Unless otherwise specified, the units of measure quoted below were used in both the United States, the United Kingdom. The SI equivalents are quoted to four significant figures.

In 1893 the United States fixed the yard at {{fract|3600|3937}} metres, making the yard 0.9144018 metres and 1896 the British authorities fixed the yard as being 0.9143993 metres. At the time the discrepancy of about two parts per million was considered to be insignificant. In 1960, the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada and South Africa standarised their units of length by defining the [[international yard and pound|"international yard"]] as being 0.9144 metres exactly. This change affected land surveyors in the United States and led to the old units being renamed "survey feet", "survey miles" etc.  However the introduction of the metric-based Ordnance Survey National Grid Surveyors in the United Kingdom in 1938 meant that British surveyors were unaffected by the change.

Units of weight in both the imperial and US customary system always used the same standard, though differences in multiples of the avoirdupois pound developed in the nineteenth century. Both systems used the three different scales <U+2013> the avoirdupois system for general use, the troy system for precious metals and the apothecaries system in the pharmacy industry. The term "weight" and "mass" are used interchangeably in the imperial and US customary systems, though since the linking of the pound to the kilogram in 19xx, the pound technically became a mass, not a weight.

====Apothecaries Weight====
{{main|Apothecaries' system}}
Apothecaries weights were used in the [[Pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] industry and have remained almost unchanged since the Middle Ages <U+2013> the Apothecaries pound and ounce being the same as the Troy pound and ounce, but each system having different sub-units. In the United Kingdom, these units are of historic interest only, having been replaced by metric units in 1970.<ref>{{cite book

=== Named units of energy, power and temperature===
The names of most derived units of measure in the imperial and US customary systems are concatenations of the constituent parts of the unit of measure, for example the unit of pressure is the ''[[Pounds per square inch|pounds [force] per square inch]]''. Apart from the [[poundal]], most of the named units of measure are [[Coherence (units of measurement)|non-coherent]], but were adopted due to traditional working practice.<ref group = Note>For example, the [[horsepower]].</ref>

===Other units===
In addition to those catalogued above, there are literally hundreds of other units of measure in both the imperial and the US customary system of measurement <U+2013> many are specific to a particular industry of application. Such units could, in theory, be replaced by general units of the same dimension, for example the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] (42 US gallons, 34.97 imperial gallons or 159.0 litres) used in the oil industry has the dimension of volume and could be replaced by the gallon, cubic metre or litre.<ref>{{cite book

The definitions of [[potential difference]] ([[volt]]), [[electric current]] ([[ampere]]), [[electrical resistance]] ([[ohm]]) were defined in terms of metric units, international agreement having been reached at a series of IEC Congress in Chicago between 1881 and 1906 when the electrical industry was in its infancy.<ref>{{cite book

Similary, the units of measurement used in the [[Radiation|radiological]] industry were defined in terms of metric units, agreement first having been reached at the second International Congress of Radiology at Stockholm (1928).<ref name=ISR_History>{{cite web

==Current status==

Since its inception, the [[metric system]] has displaced the traditional system of units in many countries.  In the 1960s a [[metrication]] program was initiated in most English-speaking countries, resulting in either the partial or total displacement of the imperial system or the US customary system of measure in those countries.  The current status of imperial and US customary units, as summarised by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]], is that "the SI metric system is now the official system of units in the United Kingdom, while the customary units are still predominantly used in the United States".<ref name=NISTB>{{cite journal

|publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)
|title = NIST Handbook 44 <U+2013> Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices
|year = 2013}}</ref>

The situation is however not as clear-cut as this. In the United States, for example, the metric system is the predominant system of measure in certain fields such as automobile manufacture even though customary units are used in aircraft manufacture.<ref>{{cite news

{{As of|2013|6}} the imperial and US customary systems of measurement were dependent on the [[International system of units|SI]] for their formal definitions, the yard being defined as 0.9144&nbsp;[[metre]]s exactly, the pound avoirdupois as {{gaps|0.453|592|37}} [[kilogram]]s exactly while both systems of measure share the definition of the [[second]].
