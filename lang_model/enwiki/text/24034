This is a list of the '''[[Premier of Ontario|premiers]]''' of the province of '''[[Ontario]]''', [[Canada]], since [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867. Like Canadian federal government, Ontario uses a [[Westminster System|Westminster-style]] [[parliamentary government]], in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislative Assembly]].  The premier, sometimes called the prime minister, acts as Ontario's [[head of government]], while the [[Queen of Canada]] acts as its [[head of state]].

This article only covers the time since the [[Canadian Confederation]] was created in 1867. For the premiers of the [[Canada West]] from 1840 to 1867, see [[List of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada]].  The governments of [[Upper Canada]] from 1792 to 1840 were mostly controlled by representatives of the Crown.

Red bordered images denote the [[Liberal Party of Ontario]], blue denotes the various parties that led to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]], green denotes the [[United Farmers of Ontario]], and orange denotes the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].
