'''No. 142 Squadron''' was a flying squadron of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).

==History==
No. 142 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) was formed at [[RFC Ismailia]], [[Egypt]] in 1918, flying a mixed bag of reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. On the formation of the Royal Air Force, on 1 April 1918, 142 Squadron was at [[RFC Julis]] in [[Palestine]], becoming No. 142 Squadron RAF (142 Squadron).  After operations in Palestine the squadron retired to RAF Suez where it disbanded on 1 February 1920, to form [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]].<ref name = "Lake"/>

==World War II==
Re-formed at [[RAF Netheravon]] on 1 June 1934, 142 Squadron flew a variety of bomber aircraft but mostly the [[Fairey Battle]] and [[Vickers Wellington]] after hostilities opened in 1939, deploying as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to [[France]]. On 5 October 1944 142 squadron was disbanded at Regine in Italy to allow the Squadron to re-form at [[RAF Gransden Lodge]] flying [[de Havilland Mosquito]] bombers as part of [[Pathfinder (RAF)|No. 8 (PFF) Group]]'s [[Light Night Striking Force]]. Soon after World War II ended the squadron was disbanded while still located at RAF Gransden Lodge.<ref name = "142Hist">http://www.raf.mod.uk/history_old/h142.html</ref>

==Post war era==
A brief period of existence occurred between 1 February 1959 and 1 April 1959 at [[RAF Eastleigh]] in [[Kenya]], where the squadron flew [[de Havilland Venom]] FB.4s and [[de Havilland Vampire]]] trainers, before re-forming as [[No. 208 Squadron RAF]].<ref name = "142Hist"/>

The latest incarnation of 142 Squadron occurred on 22 July 1959 at [[RAF Coleby Grange]] as one of 20 Strategic Missile (SM) squadrons associated with [[Project Emily]], equipped with three US [[PGM-17 Thor|Douglas Thor]] [[intermediate range ballistic missile]]s (IRBM).<ref name = "Lake"/> 142 The Thor missiles would be armed with [[W-49]] thermonuclear warheads, each with an explosive yield of 1.44 megatons. The warheads remained under the control of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) under the "Dual Key" arrangement, whereby launch of a live missile would require authority from both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States of America|US]] governments. RAF Coleby Grange was the base one of five squadrons, each armed with three missiles, based in Lincolnshire, with the headquarters at [[RAF Hemswell]] and a squadron each at [[RAF Bardney]], [[RAF Caistor]] and [[RAF Ludford Magna]].<ref name = "linc info"/>

During October 1962 142 Squadron was kept at full readiness, with the missiles aimed at strategic targets in the [[USSR]], as part of the threatened response to the [[Cuban missile crisis]]. At the conclusion of the crisis, de-activation of the Thor missiles in the UK were offered up as part of the negotiations, along with the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter]] medium range missiles in Turkey. The Thor missile squadrons were stood down in 1963, with 142 Squadron disbanding on 24 May 1963.

==Memorial at Ashdown Forest==
[[File:Airman's grave.JPG|thumb|The Airman's Grave at Ashdown Forest commemorates the six man crew of a [[Wellington bomber]] of 142 Squadron]]
The Airman's Grave at [[Ashdown Forest]] is a memorial to the six man crew of a [[Wellington bomber]] of 142 Squadron who were killed when it crashed in the forest on the morning of 31 Jul 1941 on its return from a [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|raid on Cologne]].  The memorial, which is a simple stone-walled enclosure on the heathland west of Duddleswell, shelters a white cross surrounded by a tiny garden of remembrance and was erected by the mother of Sergeant P.V.R. Sutton, who was aged 24 at the time of his death.  A short public service takes place each year on Remembrance Sunday when a wreath is laid by an Ashdown Forest Ranger, at the request of Mrs Sutton, together with one from the Ashdown Forest Riding Association.  The Ashdown Forest Centre has published a circular walk to the memorial from Hollies car park.
