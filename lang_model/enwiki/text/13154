They inhabited the meadows of Sams Walker Day Use Site, near [[Skamania, Washington]], and St. Cloud Ranch Day Use Site.  An interpretive sign at Sams Walker states that the Watlata lived in earth-sheltered cedar plank homes.  Another reports that they used willow branches to construct temporary structures.
