'''Jacob Lawrence''' (September 7, 1917 &ndash; June 9, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]]; he was married to fellow artist [[Gwendolyn Knight]]. Lawrence referred to his style as "dynamic [[cubism]]", though by his own account the primary influence was not so much French art as the shapes and colors of [[Harlem]].<ref>Robert Hughes, ''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America'', excerpted online at [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/L/lawrence.html Jacob Lawrence], Artchive.com.</ref> 

Lawrence is among the best-known twentieth century African American painters, a distinction shared with [[Romare Bearden]]. Lawrence was only in his twenties when his "Migration Series" made him nationally famous.  A part of this series was featured in a 1941 issue of ''[[Fortune magazine]]''. The series depicted the epic [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. The collection has been split into two parts for public viewing.

==Life==
Jacob Lawrence was born in 1917 in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] and died in 2000, [[Seattle, Washington]]. He was thirteen when he moved with his sister and brother to [[New York City]]. His mother enrolled him in classes at an arts and crafts settlement house in Harlem, in an effort to keep him busy. The young Lawrence often drew patterns with [[crayon]]s. Although much of his work copied his mother's [[carpet]]s, an art teacher there noted great potential in Lawrence.

After dropping out of school at sixteen, Lawrence worked in a laundry and a printing plant.  More importantly, he attended classes at the Harlem Art Workshop, taught by the African American artist [[Charles Alston]]. Alston urged him to also attend the Harlem Community Art Center, led by the sculptor [[Augusta Savage]].  Savage was able to secure Lawrence a scholarship to the [[American Artists School]] and a paid position with the [[Works Progress Administration]].  In addition to getting paid, he was able to study and work with such notable [[Harlem Renaissance]] artists as [[Charles Alston]] and [[Henry Bannarn]] in the Alston-Bannarn workshop.  

Lawrence married the painter [[Gwendolyn Knight]], who had also been a student of Savage's, on July 24, 1941.  They remained married until his death in 2000. 
In October 1943 (during the [[Second World War]]), he enlisted in the [[United States Coast Guard]] and served with the first racially integrated crew on the [[USCGC Sea Cloud (WPG-284)|USCGC Sea Cloud]], under [[Carlton Skinner]].<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/history/FAQS/Jacob_Lawrence.html Jacob Lawrence, USCG biography]</ref> He was able to paint and sketch while in the Coast Guard.

In 1970 Lawrence settled in Seattle and became an art professor at the [[University of Washington]]. Some of his works are now displayed there in the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering and in Meany Hall for the Performing Arts. The piece in the main lobby of Meany Hall, entitled "Theatre", was commissioned by the University for the hall in 1985.

Throughout his lengthy artistic career, Lawrence concentrated on depicting the history and struggles of African Americans. Lawrence's work often portrayed important periods in African-American history. The artist was twenty-one years old when his series of paintings of the Haitian general [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint L<U+2019>Ouverture]] was shown in an exhibit of African American artists at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. This impressive work was followed by a series of paintings of the lives of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Harriet Tubman]], as well as a series of pieces about the [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].  Lawrence was only twenty-three when he completed the sixty-panel set of narrative paintings entitled Migration of the Negro, now called The Migration Series. The series, a moving portrayal of the migration of hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the rural South to the North after World War I, was shown in New York, and brought him national recognition. In the 1940s Lawrence was given his first major solo exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, and became the most celebrated African American painter in the country. 

Shortly after moving to Washington State, Lawrence did a series of five paintings on the westward journey of African American pioneer [[George Washington Bush]]. These paintings are now in the collection of the [[State of Washington History Museum]].<ref>Program for "Making a Life | Creating a World", [[Northwest African American Museum]], 2008.</ref>

He illustrated an adaptation of [[Aesop's Fables]] for the [[University of Washington Press]] in 1997.<ref>[http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/LAWAES.html Aesop<U+2019>s fables (illustrated by Jacob Lawrence)] - Seattle : University of Washington Press, 1997.

Lawrence taught at several schools, and continued to paint until a few weeks before his death in June 2000 at the age of eighty-two. His last public work, the mosaic mural ''New York in Transit'', was installed in October 2001 in the [[Times Square <U+2013> 42nd Street (New York City Subway)|Times Square subway station]] in New York City.<ref>[http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/artwork_show?27 "New York in Transit, Jacob Lawrence (2001)"], NYC Subway Organization</ref>

==Recognition==
Lawrence was honored as an artist, teacher, and humanitarian when the [[NAACP]] awarded him the [[Spingarn Medal]] in 1970 for his outstanding achievements. In 1974 the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York held a major retrospective of his work, and in 1983 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> In 1998 he received Washington State's highest honor, [[The Washington Medal of Merit]]. He was awarded the U.S. [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1990. 
  
His work is in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the Museum of Modern Art, the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[Phillips Collection]], and the [[Brooklyn Museum]].In May 2007, the [[White House Historical Association]] (via the [[White House Acquisition Trust]]) purchased Lawrence's ''The Builders'' (1947) for $2.5 million at auction. The painting now hangs in the White House [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]].<ref>Jacqueline Trescott, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/19/AR2007091902423.html Green Room Makeover Incorporates a Colorful Past], ''Washington Post'', September 20, 2007. Accessed 29 December 2007.</ref>

When Lawrence died on June 9, 2000, the ''New York Times'' called him "One of America's leading modern figurative painters" and "among the most impassioned visual chroniclers of the African-American experience.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDD1F3FF933A25755C0A9669C8B63&scp=2&sq=jacob+lawrence+obituary&st=nyt  ''New York Times'' "Jacob Lawrence Is Dead at 82; Vivid Painter Who Chronicled Odyssey of Black Americans" By HOLLAND COTTER Published: June 10, 2000]</ref>" His wife, artist [[Gwendolyn Knight]] Lawrence, died several years later in 2005.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/obituaries/27knight.html   ''New York Times'' "Gwendolyn Knight, 91, Artist Who Blossomed Late in Life, Is Dead" By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT Published: February 27, 2005]</ref> Before Lawrence died, the Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation was formally established. Today, it serves as both Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence's official Estates,<ref>[http://www.jacobandgwenlawrence.org/   The Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation website]</ref> and maintains a searchable archive of nearly 1,000 images of their work.<ref>[http://www.jacobandgwenlawrence.org/artandlife04.html   The Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation Website's Searchable Archive]</ref> The U.S. copyright representative for the Jacob and Gwendolyn Knight Lawrence Foundation is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref>[http://arsny.com/requested.html   Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society]</ref>

==Legacy==
The [[Seattle Art Museum]] offers the [[Gwendolyn Knight]] and Jacob Lawrence Fellowship, a $10,000 award to "individuals whose original work reflects the Lawrences' concern for artistic excellence, education, mentorship and scholarship within the cultural contexts and value systems that informed their work and the work of other artists of color."<ref>Seattle Art Museum, [http://seattleartmuseum.org/Learn/fellowship.asp About the Gwendolyn Knight & Jacob Lawrence Fellowship], 2009.</ref>
