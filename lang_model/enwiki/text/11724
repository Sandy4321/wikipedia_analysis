She is known for her activism for rights [[right to education|to education]] and [[women's rights|for women]], especially in the Swat Valley, where the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Taliban]] had at times [[Taliban treatment of women|banned girls from attending school]]. In early 2009, at the age of 11<U+2013>12, Yousafzai wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the [[BBC]] detailing her life under Taliban rule, their attempts to take control of the valley, and her views on promoting education for girls in the Swat Valley. The following summer, a ''[[New York Times]]'' documentary by journalist Adam B. Ellick was filmed about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region, culminating in the [[Second Battle of Swat]]. Yousafzai rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the [[International Children's Peace Prize]] by South African activist [[Desmond Tutu]].

In the afternoon of Tuesday, 9 October 2012, Malala boarded her school bus in the northwest Pakistani district of Swat. A gunman asked for Malala by name, then pointed a Colt 45 at her and fired three shots. One bullet hit the left side of Malala's forehead, traveled under her skin the length of her face and then into her shoulder.<ref>http://gma.yahoo.com/72-hours-saved-malala-doctors-reveal-first-time-101347540--abc-news-topstories.html</ref>

In the days immediately following the attack, she remained unconscious and in critical condition, but later her condition improved enough for her to be sent to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], for intensive rehabilitation. On 12 October, a group of 50 Islamic clerics in Pakistan issued a [[fatw<U+0101>]] against those who tried to kill her, but the Taliban reiterated its intent to kill Yousafzai and [[Ziauddin Yousafzai|her father]].

The assassination attempt sparked a national and international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' wrote in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become "the most famous teenager in the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/will-malalas-influence-stretch-to-europe/a-16532149 |title=Will Malala's Influence Stretch to Europe? |author=Kyle McKinnon |date=18 January 2013 |work=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education [[Gordon Brown]] launched a UN petition in Yousafzai's name, using the slogan "I am Malala" and demanding that all children worldwide be in school by the end of 2015 <U+2013> a petition which helped lead to the ratification of Pakistan's first Right to Education Bill.<ref name="brookings.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/04/08-pakistan-education-winthrop |title=Quiet Progress for Education in Pakistan |publisher=Brookings Institution |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> In 29 April 2013 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Yousafzai was featured on the magazine's front cover and as one of "[[Time 100|The 100 Most Influential People in the World]]".

Only 11 pupils attended the class out of 27. The number decreased because of Taleban's edict. My three friends have shifted to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi with their families after this edict.

On 3 January 2009, Yousafzai's first entry was posted to the BBC Urdu blog. She would hand-write notes and then pass them on to a reporter who would scan and e-mail them.<ref name="new yorker"/> The blog records Yousafzai's thoughts during the [[First Battle of Swat]], as military operations take place, fewer girls show up to school, and finally, her school shuts down.

In Mingora, the Taliban had set an edict that no girls could attend school after 15 January 2009. The group had already blown up more than a hundred girls<U+2019> schools.<ref name="new yorker"/> The night before the ban took effect was filled with the noise of artillery fire, waking Yousafzai several times. The following day, Yousafzai also read for the first time excerpts from her blog that had been published in a local newspaper.<ref name="BBC Diary"/>

====Banned from school====
After the ban, the Taliban continued to destroy schools in the area.<ref name="full blog">{{cite web|title=Swat: Diary of a Pakistani schoolgirl (Malala Yousafzai) <U+2013> BBC|url=http://criticalppp.com/archives/771|work=original Urdu and English translation of Yousufzai's blog|publisher=LUBP|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Five days later in her blog, Yousafzai wrote that she was still studying for her exams: "Our annual exams are due after the vacations but this will only be possible if the Taliban allow girls to go to school.

In February 2009, girls' schools were still closed. In solidarity, private schools for boys had decided not to open until 9 February, and notices appeared saying so.<ref name="full blog"/> On 7 February, Yousafzai and a brother returned to their hometown of Mingora, where the streets were deserted, and there was an "eerie silence". "We went to the supermarket to buy a gift for our mother but it was closed, whereas earlier it used to remain open till late. Many other shops were also closed", she wrote in her blog. Their home had been robbed and their television was stolen.<ref name="full blog"/>

After boys' schools reopened, the Taliban lifted restrictions on girls' primary education, where there was [[Mixed-sex education|co-education]]. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled.<ref name="full blog"/>

On 15 February, gunshots could be heard in the streets of Mingora, but Yousafzai's father reassured her, saying "don't be scared <U+2013> this is firing for peace". Her father had read in the newspaper that the government and the militants were going to sign a peace deal the next day. Later that night, when the Taliban announced the peace deal on their [[FM broadcasting|FM Radio]] studio, another round of stronger firing started outside.<ref name="full blog"/> Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban on the national current affairs show ''[[Capital Talk]]'' on 18 February.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19890029 |title=Pakistan media condemn attack on Malala Yousafzai |date=9 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> Three days later, [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi|local Taliban]] leader [[Fazlullah (militant leader)|Maulana Fazlulla]] announced on his FM radio station that he was lifting the ban on women's education, and girls would be allowed to attend school until exams were held on 17 March, but they had to wear [[burqa]]s.<ref name="full blog"/>

====Girls' schools reopen====
On 25 February, Yousafzai wrote on her blog that she and her classmates "played a lot in class and enjoyed ourselves like we used to before".<ref name="full blog"/> Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted.<ref name="full blog"/> Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: "People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people are saying that the peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting".<ref name="full blog"/>

On 9 March, Yousafzai wrote about a science paper that she performed well on, and added that the Taliban were no longer searching vehicles as they once did. Her blog ended on 12 March 2009.<ref name="final entry">{{cite web|title=(Part 10 of Yousfzai's blog)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/interactivity/2009/03/090313_swat_diary_part10_aw.shtml|publisher=BBC Urdu| accessdate=16 October 2012|author=Malala Yousufzai|language=Urdu}}</ref>

After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and her father were approached by ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Adam B. Ellick]] about filming a documentary.<ref name="iwpr"/> In May, the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani Army]] moved into the region to regain control during the [[Second Battle of Swat]]. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to [[Peshawar]] to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. "I'm really bored because I have no books to read," Yousafzai is filmed saying in the documentary.<ref name="Class dismissed"/>

That month, after criticizing militants at a press conference, Yousafzai's father received a death threat over the radio by a Taliban commander.<ref name="Class dismissed"/> Yousafzai was deeply inspired in her activism by her father.

By early July, refugee camps were filled to capacity. The prime minister made a long-awaited announcement saying that it was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first <U+2013> to meet with a group of other [[grassroots]] activists that had been invited to see United States [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]'s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]]. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, "Respected ambassador, if you can help us in our education, so please help us." When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.<ref name="Class dismissed"/>

Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] was the first to sign a petition requesting that Yousafzai receive the Nobel Peace Prize.<ref name=mm1008>{{cite news|last=Mackinnon|first=Mark|title=One year after being shot by the Taliban, Malala Yousafzai is a mighty machine|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/malala-yousafzai-a-strong-message-a-mighty-machine/article14762416/|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=8 October 2013|location=Toronto}}</ref>

Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arranged for Yousafzai's appearance before the United Nations in July 2013.<ref name=afp20131011 /> Brown also requested that [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] consultant [[Shiza Shahid]], a friend of the Yousafzai family, chair Malala's charity fund, which had gained the support of [[Angelina Jolie]].<ref name=afp20131011 /> Google's vice president [[Megan Smith]] also sits on the fund's board.<ref name=mm1008 />

In November 2012 the consulting firm [[Edelman]] began work for Yousafzai on a pro bono basis, which according to the firm "involves providing a press office function for Malala."<ref name=afp20131011 /><ref name=mm1008 /> The office employs five people, and is headed by speechwriter Jamie Lundie.<ref name=mm1008 /> McKinsey also continues to provide assistance to Yousafzai.<ref name=mm1008 />

===Malala Day===
On 12 July 2013, Yousafzai's 16th birthday, she spoke at the UN to call for worldwide access to education. The UN dubbed the event "Malala Day".<ref name=BBC127 /> It was her first public speech since the attack,<ref name=Reuters127>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/12/us-malala-un-idUSBRE96B0IC20130712 |title=Pakistan's Malala, shot by Taliban, takes education plea to U.N. |author=Michelle Nichols |date=12 July 2013 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> leading the first ever Youth Takeover of the UN, with an audience of over 500 young education advocates from around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2013/07/17/global-action-on-education-doesnt-end-with-malala-day/ |title=Global action on education doesn<U+2019>t end with Malala Day &#124; Ottawa Citizen |publisher=Blogs.ottawacitizen.com |date= |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>

I'm here to speak up for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all terrorists and extremists."<ref name=Reuters127 /></blockquote>

Yousafzai received several standing ovations.

==Reception in Pakistan==
Reception at home has been somewhat more mixed. ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' columnist Huma Yusuf summarized three main complaints of Yousafzai's critics: "Her fame highlights Pakistan<U+2019>s most negative aspect (rampant militancy); her education campaign echoes Western agendas; and the West's admiration of her is hypocritical because it overlooks the plight of other innocent victims, like the casualties of U.S. drone strikes."<ref name=Yusef>{{cite news |url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/the-malala-backlash/?_r=0 |title=About the Malala Backlash |author=Huma Yusuf |date=18 July 2013 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> Another Dawn journalist, Cyril Almeida, addressed the public's lack of rage against the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]], blaming the failing state government.<ref name=Almeida>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1049432/hating-malala |title=Hating Malala |author=Cyril Almeida |date=13 October 2013 |work=Dawn |accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Journalist Assed Baig described her as being used to justify Western imperialism as "the perfect candidate for the white man to relieve his burden and save the native".<ref name=Star /> Yousafzai was also accused on social media of being a CIA spy.<ref name=Star>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/07/19/malala_yousafzai_backlash_against_pakistani_teen_activist_spreads_in_her_homeland.html |title=Malala Yousafzai: Backlash against Pakistani teen activist spreads in her homeland |author=Ghafour, Hamida |date=19 June 2013 |work=The Toronto Star |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>
