The '''Ithaca Gun Company''' is a manufacturer of [[shotgun]]s and [[rifle]]s originally established in [[Ithaca, New York]] in 1880.

==History==

Over the years, Ithaca made numerous firearms, most notably the [[Ithaca 37]] shotgun. 

===Production===

Ithaca became famous for building firearms based on expired patents owned by [[Remington Arms]] (in 1989, Remington purchased a design from Ithaca, the [[Ithaca Mag-10|Mag-10]] shotgun, which they produced as the [[Remington Model SP-10|SP-10]]). Ithaca also produced the [[M1911 Colt pistol|M1911]] pistol and the [[M3 submachine gun|M3 Grease Gun]] for the United States military during [[World War II]]. Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and [[New York Police Department]], and even sold to the [[Royal Thai Army]] in the early 1980s to arm farmers against communist infiltrators.<ref name="nyt thai">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE0DB123BF933A05755C0A964948260|title=Ithaca Gun Co.

Around 1877, Leroy Smith went into business with William Henry Baker. They moved the ''W.H. Baker Company'', which manufactured [[double-barreled shotgun|double- and triple-barreled shotguns]], from [[Lisle (town), New York|Center Lisle, New York]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].<ref name="tigc">{{cite book|title=The Ithaca Gun Company|last=Snyder|first=Walter|publisher=Cook & Uline|location=[[Southern Pines, North Carolina|Southern Pines]]|year=1999|page=15|isbn=978-0962946929}}</ref> In 1883, Baker, Smith, and several partners moved to Ithaca and established the original Ithaca Gun Company.<ref name="igchistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.ithacagun.com/history.html|title=Historical Overview of the Ithaca Gun Company|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> The company was responsible for much of the early industry of [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]], especially during [[World War I]] and World War II,<ref name="cdshazardoushistory">{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/26384|title=Gun Factory Building Has Hazardous History|work=[[Cornell Daily Sun]]|last=O'Toole|first=Molly|date=November 28, 2007}}</ref> and counted among its later patrons [[John Philip Sousa]] and [[Annie Oakley]].<ref name="auburn sold">{{cite news|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2005/11/30/news/local_news/news01.txt|title=125-year-old company sold off at auction|work=The Auburn Citizen|last=Gleason|first=Anne|date=November 30, 2005}}</ref>

===Lefever guns===

The ''[[Lefever Arms Company]]'' (1883-1916) was a manufacturer of guns in [[Syracuse, New York]] founded by [[Daniel Myron LeFever]] (1835-1906) who was an American gun maker, popularly known as "Uncle Dan LeFever". He is best known as the inventor of the [[hammerless]] shotgun, first introduced in 1878. The company was in the business of gun manufacture until 1916 when they were incorporated with '''Ithaca Gun Company''' in [[Ithaca, New York]] who continued with the LeFever gun production until 1921.<ref name="gear">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA488&lpg=PA488&dq=lefever+arms+company&source=bl&ots=KQOS3YLyIH&sig=iRwGRuZYOI1EKiuSFsnRZFVJa4c&hl=en&ei=M5GKTLmlFpKasAP56KXkBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDUQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&q=lefever%20arms%20company&f=false |title=Recent Trade Developments |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |work=|publisher=The Horseless Age - Volume 37, E.

===Fall creek===

The original factory was located in the Fall Creek in [[Tompkins County, New York |Tompkins County]] neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as ''Gun Hill'', where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. In later years, the company came under criticism regarding environmental pollution of [[Fall Creek, New York |Fall Creek]], especially by [[lead]], which led to a [[Superfund]] remediation effort. Various plans to demolish the derelict plant and to redevelop the land have failed over the years, on account of the cost of remediation and community objection to construction proposals. The factory was condemned in March 2006.<ref name="cdsrejuvenate">{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/26431|title=Clean-up, Construction to Rejuvenate Ithaca Gun Site|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=November 30, 2007|first=Molly|last=O'Toole}}</ref>

===Reorganization===

The company was controlled by the Smith family until 1967, when it was sold to a [[Colorado]] company which later became ''General Recreation, Inc.'' It filed for [[Chapter 11]] reorganization in 1979. In 1987, new owners ''Ithaca Acquisition, Inc.'' moved manufacturing to [[King's Ferry, New York]]. In 2005, it received a $150,000 development loan from [[Cayuga County, New York |Cayuga County]]<ref name="auburn closes">{{cite news|title=Ithaca Gun loses buyer, closes its doors|work=The Auburn Citizen|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2005/06/23/news/news02.txt|last=Broach|first=Louse Hoffman|date=June 23, 2005}}</ref>, and in May of that year moved to larger facilities in [[Auburn, New York]]<ref name="auburn reloads">{{cite news|url=http://www.auburnpub.com/articles/2005/05/06/news/news06.txt|title=Ithaca Gun reloads in Auburn|work=The Auburn Citizen|date=May 6, 2005|last=Broach|first=Louise Hoffman}}</ref>. After a potential buyer withdrew, however, the indebted company was closed and many of its assets sold at auction on November 29, 2005 to the Marshals of ''Ithaca Guns, USA LLC.'' Finally, David Dlubak bought the current ''Ithaca Gun Company'' and acquired the company's assets in June 2007. Since then, the factory has moved to [[Upper Sandusky, Ohio]] and undergone a total revamp, covering all areas of the manufacturing process.<ref name="igchistory" />
