'''Causant<U+00ED>n of Fife''' is the first man we know for certain to have been [[Mormaer of Fife]]. Causant<U+00ED>n's ''[[floruit]]'' can be placed between 1095 and 1128. Very little is known about his life and reign as Mormaer of Fife. His father, for instance, is not known by name. He may have been the son or grandson of the Mac Duib who gave rise to William Shakespeare's character [[Macduff (thane)|Macduff]]; the latter being the son of Giric, son of [[Kenneth III of Scotland|Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Duib]], king of Alba (997-1005).<ref>John Bannerman, "MacDuff of Fife," in A. Grant & K. Stringer (eds.) ''Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G.W.S. Barrow'',  (Edinburgh, 1993), pp. 21&ndash;33.</ref> His role as a senior lawman makes it likely that he spent some time in his early life at a native Scottish law school, but this is simply reasoned conjecture.<ref>John Bannerman, <U+201C>The Kings Poet and the Inauguration of Alexander III<U+201D>, in ''The Scottish Historical Review'', 68 (1989), p. 139.</ref> 

His first appearance in history is a charter dated to 1095, he appears as ''Constantinus filius Magduffe''. The historian John Bannerman suggests that this represents a translation of ''Causant<U+00ED>n mac meic Duib''. Here, ''mac meic'' means grandson, or ancestor, in the same way that the Irish used ''Ua''. The ''mac meic'' formula can be shown in Ireland. The ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' (s.a. 1028), for instance, used this formula where they would later use ''Ua''.<ref>''Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1028.7, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text599.html here].</ref> If Bannerman's suggestion is correct, the charter is calling Causantin the "descendant of [[Dub of Scotland|Dub]]" rather than a son of a man with the name ''MacDuib'' (=''[[Clan MacDuff]]''). Similar examples can, again, be seen for the more extensive evidence offered by contemporary Ireland. For example, the ''Annals of Ulster'' style Tadg, son of Muiredach, as ''Mac Carthaig'',<ref>''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 1118.6, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100004/text007.html here].</ref> but it was Tadg's grandfather (and Muiredach's father) who was called ''Carthach''. By comparison, the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' call the same man ''mac meic Carthaig''.<ref>''Annals of Innisfallen'', s.a. 1118.7, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100004/text007.html here].</ref> Staying in Ireland, the Kings of [[Cen<U+00E9>l nE<U+00F3>gain]] call themselves ''Meic Lochlainn''. One is called ''Conchobar mac Meic Lochlainn'';<ref>''Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1128.3, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text699.html here].</ref> This very same kindred were also known as the ''U<U+00ED> Lochlainn'' (AU, s.a. 1102 & 1109).<ref>E.g. ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a.  1102.8 & 1109.5, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text673.html here] and [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text680.html here], where Ua is rendered by ''H'';  For all this, see John Bannerman, "MacDuff of Fife," in A. Grant & K. Stringer (eds.) ''Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G.W.S. Barrow'',  (Edinburgh, 1993), pp. 24&ndash;30.</ref>

In the 1128, in the fourth year of the reign of King [[David I of Scotland]], Causant<U+00ED>n appears as ''Magnus Judex in Scotia'', "High ''[[Brehon|Brithem]]''" of Scotland north of the [[river Forth]], an office held to be the Gaelic precursor to what would become the [[Justiciar of Scotia|Justiciarship of Scotia]].<ref>G.W.S. Barrow, "The Justiciar", in G.W.S. Barrow (ed.), ''The Kingdom of the Scots'', (Edinburgh, 2003),  p. 84&ndash;5; Dauvit Broun, "Anglo-French acculturation", in Brendan Smith (ed.), ''Britain and Ireland, 900-1300'', (Cambridge, 1999), p. 139.</ref> In this role, he appears alongside the ''Judex'' M<U+00E1>el Domnaich mac Meic Bethad (Maldoven son of Macbeth) as arbitrator in a land dispute between a knight called Robert of Burgon (aka Robert the Burgundian, who owned the estate of [[Lochore]],which bordered the disputed territory), and the [[Culdee|C<U+00E9>li D<U+00E9>]] of [[St Serf's Inch]]. In this case, both Causant<U+00ED>n and M<U+00E1>el Domnaich chose to defer to the superior legal wisdom of another ''Judex'', Dubgall mac Mocche (Dufgal son of Mochta(?)).<ref>Archibald Lawrie, ''Early Scottish Charters Prior to A.D. 1153'', (Glasgow, 1905), no. 80; see Barrow, "The ''Judex''", in G.W.S. Barrow (ed.), ''The Kingdom of the Scots'', (Edinburgh, 2003), p. 58.</ref> Causant<U+00ED>n appears in a charter of King David's, dated 1126, giving confirmation of the rights of [[Dunfermline Abbey|Dunfermline Priory]] and promoting it to Abbey status. His name occurs as a witness, alongside bishops [[John the Chaplain|John of Glasgow]], [[Robert of Scone|Robert of St Andrews]], [[Cormac of Dunkeld]], [[Gregoir of Moray]], [[Mac Bethad of Rosemarkie]], and mormaers [[M<U+00E1>el <U+00CD>su I, Earl of Strathearn|M<U+00E1>el <U+00CD>su of Strathearn]], [[Ruadr<U+00ED>, Earl of Mar|Ruadr<U+00ED> of Mar]], [[Matad, Earl of Atholl|Matad of Atholl]], as well as his kinsman, [[Gille M<U+00ED>ch<U+00E9>il, Earl of Fife|Gille M<U+00ED>ch<U+00E9>il, chief of ''Clann meic Duib'']] and others.<ref>see ''Registrum de Dunfermelyn'', (Bannatyne Club, 1842),  pp. 3&ndash;4; Richard Oram, ''David: The King Who Made Scotland'', (Gloucestershire, 2004), p. 82.</ref> It so happens that Causant<U+00ED>n appears to have gotten involved in several disputes with the said monastery, and he is alleged to have withheld lands around Kirkcaldy which had been granted to the monastery.<ref>See James Balfour Paul, ''The Scots Peerage'', Vol. VI, (Edinburgh, 1909), pp. 3&ndash;4.</ref>

He appears to have been dead by 1130, when another member of the ''Mac Duib'' kindred, the Gille M<U+00ED>ch<U+00E9>il who appeared alongside Causant<U+00ED>n in the charter of 1126, is ruling as mormaer; although the latter may have been using the title ''comes'' (mormaer) as early as 1126, and had been using the style ''Mac Duib'' since at least 1126.<ref>John Bannerman, "MacDuff of Fife", p. 31.</ref> [[Donnchad I, Earl of Fife|Donnchad I]], who succeeded Gille M<U+00ED>cheil, may have been Causant<U+00ED>n's son.<ref>Ibid.,  p. 33.</ref>
