'''Jacobo Timerman''' (6 January 1923 <U+2013> 11 November 1999) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] publisher, journalist, and author who was persecuted and honored for confronting the atrocities of the Argentine military regime's [[Dirty War]].  Born in [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]], [[Ukraine]], Timerman and his family emigrated to Argentina in 1928.

==Biography==
===Work and imprisonment in Argentina===
During the 1960s, Timerman established himself as a popular journalist, and, before the decade had come to a close, was already able to found two different weekly news magazines.  Later, from 1971 to 1977, Timerman edited and published the left-leaning daily ''[[La Opini<U+00F3>n (Argentina)|La Opini<U+00F3>n]]''.  Under his leadership, this paper publicized news and criticisms of the [[human rights]] violations of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government during the early years of the [[Dirty War]] as a result of investigations about his relationship with [[David Graiver]].<ref>[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/16473/kristol-clear/ Kristol Clear How the neoconservative columnist<U+2019>s x-ray vision will be missed]</ref>  On 15 April 1977, Timerman was arrested by the military.  Thereafter, he was subjected to electric shock torture, beatings, and solitary confinement.  These experiences were chronicled in his 1981 book ''[[Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number]]'', and a [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085745/  1983 movie by the same name]. The Armed Forces who seized power in 1966, overthrowing president Illia, began a repressive and unpopular regime, characteristic for its violent actions against Argentina's universities and for its policy of establishing strict and conservative catholic morals. 

===Life in Israel===
After his release from prison in September 1979, Timerman was forced into exile and went to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].  A year after publishing ''Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number'', he released ''The Longest War''.  This book was a detailed and personal response to the first few months of Israel's [[1982 invasion of Lebanon]].

===Return to Argentina===
Sometime after the publication of ''The Longest War'', Timerman moved to [[Madrid]] and then to [[New York]].  Finally, in 1984, he returned to [[Buenos Aires]].  Three years later, in 1987, Timerman released ''Chile: Death in the South'', a critical examination of life under dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]]. 

Timerman died in [[Buenos Aires]] on 11 November 1999.

The Catholic priest [[Christian Von Wernich|Christian von Wernich]], personal confessor of provincial chief of police [[Ram<U+00F3>n Camps]], was convicted of involvement in his abduction and torture (and that of many others) on 9 October 2007.
