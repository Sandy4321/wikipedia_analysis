'''"What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?"''' is a story that appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #775 as published by [[DC Comics]] in March 2001. 

Written by [[Joe Kelly]], pencilled by [[Doug Mahnke]] and [[Lee Bermejo]], and inked by Tom Nguyen, Dexter Vines, Jim Royal, Jose Marzan, Wade Von Grawbadger and Wayne Faucher. 

==Plot summary==

This tale features [[The Elite]], a team of super-powered antiheroes fronted by [[Manchester Black]], who gained worldwide popularity for viciously killing their foes. Despite the acclaim and approval that the Elite are enjoying, Superman knows that they are in the wrong.

==Notes==
The story was largely conceived as a response towards the popularity of the DC Comics/Wildstorm Comics series "The Authority". "The Authority", which featured jaded, ultra-violent super-heroes who routinely killed their enemies and who flaunted their powers and willingness to kill to prevent others from opposing them/criticize them, became incredibly popular and influential within the comic industry during it's original 29 issue run. "What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way?" is largely seen as a rejection of the principles presented by Warren Ellis and Mark Millar, who wrote the original Authority series regarding the super-hero genre of comics. 

The story's title is a play on the [[Nick Lowe]] song "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?]]".

This issue was voted number 1 by ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'''s Top Ten Comics of the Decade.

==Collected format==
The story was originally republished in the most recent printing of '''''Superman: The Greatest Stories Ever Told''''' collection. It was also collected in 'Justice League Elite Volume 1".
