'''''Portrait of a Lady''''' (or '''''Portrait of a Woman''''') is a small [[panel painting|oil-on-oak panel]] executed around 1460 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (1399 or 1400<U+2013>1464). The composition is built from underlying geometric shapes that form the lines of the woman's veil, neckline, face and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model. 

Van der Weyden was preoccupied by [[portrait painting|portraiture]] towards the end of his life<ref name="H&W242">Hand& Wolff, 242</ref> and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers.<ref name="K407">Kleiner, 407</ref> She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair, long forehead and the elaborate frame set the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman signed by van der Weyden,<ref name="H&W242">Hand & Wolff, 242</ref> yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.

Although he did not adhere to the conventions of idealisation, van der Weyden generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded<U+2014>almost sculpted<U+2014>facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a striking resemblance to each other.<ref name="g60">Gr<U+00F6>ssinger, 60</ref> Since 1937, the painting has been held by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. It has been described as "famous among all portraits of women of all schools".<ref name="V76">Van Der Elst, 76</ref>

==Description==
The woman, who is probably in her late teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is [[Perspective (graphical)|flat]] and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary [[Jan van Eyck]] (c.&nbsp;1395 <U+2013> 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to focus attention on the sitter,<ref>Friedl<U+00E6>nder, 37</ref> It was not until [[Hans Memling]] (c.&nbsp;1435 <U+2013> 94), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape,<ref>Kemperdick, 24</ref> In this work the flat setting allows the viwer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession.<ref name="K407" /> Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; it is likely that the the angles created by the sitter's [[hennin]] and dress were once much sharper. 

[[File:Petrus Christus 004.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]] (c.&nbsp;1410/1420 <U+2013> 1475/1476), ''Portrait of a Female Donor'', c.&nbsp;1455, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington. Christus' work was highly influential on van der Weyden as can be seen in the expression and colouring.<ref name="k23">Kemperdick, 23</ref>|alt=see caption and text]] 

The woman wears an elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur at the neck and wrist.<ref name="H&W242"/><ref>"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=51&detail=none Portrait of a Lady, c.&nbsp;1460]". [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington. Retrieved 8 March 2010.</ref> Her clothes are of the then-fashionable [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] style, which emphasises the tall and thin aesthetic of the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] ideal.<ref group="note">Van der Weyden often worked on commission from members of the Burgundian court. See Schneider, 40</ref> Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The [[Buff (colour)|buff]]-coloured "hennin" headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention to the structure of the clothing<U+2014>the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position<U+2014>is typical for the artist.<ref name = "Campbell-140">Campbell & Van der Stock, 140</ref> 

The woman's veil forms a diamond shape, balanced by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, [[Cleavage (breasts)|d<U+00E9>colletage]] and veil.<ref name="H&W242" /> The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and a forehead likely to have been shaved to create a fashionably high, artificial hairline. Her hair is tightly pinned back on the rim of the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.<ref name="g60" /> 

The woman's left ear is set, according to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel to her eyes rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue the flow of the diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 1400s, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.<ref name="S40">Schneider, 40</ref>  

[[File:Rogier van der weyden, ritratto di donna, washington, dettaglio mani.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Crop of the Washington portrait showing the woman's tightly crossed fingers and red belt|alt=see caption and text]]

The woman's hands are crossed tightly as if in prayer, and positioned so low in the painting as to appear to be resting on the frame.<ref name="h&w 244">Hand & Wolff, 244</ref> They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head.<ref name="C15" /> Her slender  fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting,<ref name="S40" /> and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.<ref name="C15" />

Her eyes gaze downward in humility, in contrast to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work.  Her eyes and nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller by the use of tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition, the contours of her face are highlighted in a manner that is slightly unnatural and abstract,<ref name="C15">Campbell, 15</ref> and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th&nbsp;century human representation.<ref name="C28"/> This methodology was described by art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]: "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features<U+2014>salient both from a [[physiognomical]] and psychological point of view<U+2014>which he expressed primarily by lines."<ref name="K22">Kemperdick, 22</ref> Her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of "an unresolved conflict in her personality".<ref name="W126">Walker, 126</ref>  

The sitter is unknown, although some art historians have speculated on her identity. On the grounds of similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century that she might be Marie de Valengin,<ref>Monro & Monro, 620</ref> the illegitimate daughter of [[Philip the Good|Philip the Good of Burgundy]].<ref group="note">Philip the Good commissioned a portrait from Van der Weyden around 1450</ref> However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held.<ref name="h&w 244" /> Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.<ref name="h&w 244" />

==Break from the tradition of idealisation==

Van der Weyden worked in the same tradition of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck<ref group="note">While van der Weyden  would have seen van Eyck's work, it is not known if the two met. Van Eyck died in 1441</ref> and [[Robert Campin]].<ref group="note">He was apprenticed to Campin in 1426. See Friedl<U+00E6>nder, 16</ref> In the early to middle 1400s, these three artists were among the first generation of "[[Northern Renaissance]]" painters, and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically, rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form. In earlier Netherlandish art the profile view was the dominant way to present representations of the nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture.<ref>Smith, 95<U+2013>96</ref> In works such as ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'' (1433), [[Jan van Eyck]] broke this tradition and used the three-quarter profile of the face which became the standard in Netherlandish art. Here, van der Weyden utilises the same profile, which better allows him to describe the shape of the head and facial features of the sitter.<ref>Smith, 96</ref> She is shown in half-length, which enables the artist to show her hands crossed at her waist.<ref>"[http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/144/index.shtm Virtue and Beauty: Leonardo's Ginevra De' Benci and Renaissance Portraits of Women]". National Gallery of Art, Washington. Retrieved 27 March 2010.</ref> 

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portret van een Vrouw.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Portrait of a Young Woman, c.&nbsp;1435|Portrait of a Woman]]'', c.&nbsp;1435, [[Berlin State Museums|Staatlichen Museum]], Berlin. This is a more natural depiction, with larger breasts than the typical extreme slenderness of his female subjects.<ref name="g60" />|alt=see caption and text]]

Despite this new freedom, van der Weyden's portraits of women are strikingly similar in concept and structure, both to each other<ref name="g60" /> and to female portraits by Campin.<ref group="note">The similarity between van der Weyden  and Campion's female portraits is so strong that they were sometimes misattributed. See Campbell, 19</ref> Most are three-quarter face and half-length. They typically set their models in front of a dark background that is uniform and nondescript. While the portraits are noted for their expressive pathos,<ref>"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/rogier-van-der-weyden Rogier van der Weyden]". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 8 March, 2010.</ref> the facial features of the women strongly resemble one another. This indicates that although van der Weyden did not adhere to the tradition of idealised representation, he sought to please his sitters in a manner that reflected contemporary ideals of beauty. Most of van der Weyden's portraits were painted on commission from nobility; he painted only five (including ''Portrait of a Lady'') that were not [[donor portrait]]s.<ref group="note">Portraits were at the time a common means of initiating marriage alliances. Christus, van Eyck and van der Weyden were known to have been employed for this reason. In particular, the extent and level of detail that Christus and van der Weyden undertook to make their subjects appear attractive suggest this was often a primary motive. See Wilson, 47<U+2013>48</ref><ref>Campbell, 14</ref> It is known that in his ''[[Portrait of Philip de Cro<U+00FF>]]'' (c.&nbsp;1460), van der Weyden complimented the young Belgian noble by concealing his large nose and undershot jaw.<ref name="C15" /> When describing this tendency in relation to the Washington portrait, art historian Norbert Schneider wrote, "While van Eyck shows nature 'in the raw', as it were, Rogier improves on physical reality, civilising and refining Nature and the human form with the help of a brush."<ref name="S40" />

[[File:Portrait of a Lady 1460.jpg|thumb|130px|Workshop of Rogier van der Weyden, ''Portrait of a Lady'', c.&nbsp;1460. [[National Gallery]], London. This similar painting is much less detailed and comes from his workshop. It may date from as late as 1466.<ref>"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/workshop-of-rogier-van-der-weyden-portrait-of-a-lady Portrait of a Lady]". [[National Gallery]], London. Retrieved 8 March 2010.</ref>|alt=see caption and text]]
The high quality of the painting is highlighted when compared to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery's]] very similar workshop painting. The London subject has softer, more rounded features and is younger and less individually characterised than the c.&nbsp;1460 model. The technique also is less subtle and fine in the London work.<ref>See Hand & Wolff, 244 for a comparison</ref> However, both share a similar expressions and dress.<ref name="g60" />

Van der Weyden was more concerned with the aesthetic and emotional response created by the pictures overall than in the specific portraits. Art historian and research curator Lorne Campbell suggests that the popularity of ''Portrait of a Lady'' is due more to the "elegant simplicity of the pattern which [the sitter] creates" than to the grace of her depiction. While van der Weyden did not stay within the traditional realms of idealisation, he created his own aesthetic, which he extended across his portraits and religious pictures.<ref>Campbell, 16</ref> This aesthetic includes the mood of sorrowful devotion which forms the dominant tone in all his portraits. His figures may be more natural than those of earlier generations of artists; however, his individualistic approach to the depiction of his sitters' piety often leads to the abandonment of the rules of scale.<ref name="C28">Campbell, 28</ref>

John Walker, former director of the National Gallery of Art, referred to the subject as "outr<U+00E9>", but believed that despite the awkwardness of her individual features, the model was nonetheless "strangely beautiful".<ref name="W126">Walker, 126</ref> By the time of the work completion van der Weyden had eclipsed even van Eyck in popularity, and this painting is typical of the austerely spirituality, over the latter's sensuality, for which van der Weyden is renowned.<ref>Friedl<U+00E6>nder, 268</ref>

==Condition and provenance==
Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's name is not recorded in any of the early inventories,<ref NAME="Fred">Kleiner, Fred. "Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective". Wadsworth Publishing, 2009. ISBN 0-4955-7364-7</ref> the style of the sitter's dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.&nbsp;1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style.<ref name="C102">Campbell, 102</ref> However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).<ref name="h&w 244" /> 

[[File:Portrait of a Woman X-radiograph.JPG|thumb|110px|This 1937 [[Radiography|radiograph]] shows that the woman's waist was at first more narrow while her breasts were more pronounced.<ref name="H&W242"/>|alt=see caption and text]]

''Portrait of a Lady '' was painted on a single oak board with a vertical grain and has an unpainted margin on each side. The panel was prepared with [[gesso]], upon which the figure was then painted in monochrome. Glazes of oil pigment were then added, which allowed for subtle and transparent tonal gradations.<ref name="W126">Walker, 126</ref> [[Infrared#Art history|Infra-red reflectography]] reveals that van der Weyden did not sketch the work on the board before he began to paint, and there is no evidence of [[underdrawing]]. It shows that the lady was portrayed as more slender before changes were made as the work progressed; thickly applied background paint underlies some of the belt, demonstrating that the original silhouette was widened. These changes are also visible in [[x-ray]] images.<ref name="H&W242">Hand and Wolff, 242</ref> As of 2010, it is in relatively good condition, having been cleaned a number of times, most recently in 1980. There is some loss of paint on the veil, headdress and sleeve, and abrasion on the ear.<ref name="NGA2">"[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=51&detail=tech Conservation Notes]". National Gallery of Art, Washington. Retrieved 8 March, 2010.</ref>

The [[Provenance#Arts and Antiques|provenance]] of the painting is unclear, and there is doubt as to which painting is referred to in some early inventories. An [[Anhalt]] prince, likely Leopold Friedrich Franz (d.&nbsp;1817) of [[W<U+00F6>rlitz]], near [[Dessau]], Germany, held it in the early 19th&nbsp;century,<ref name="C102" /><ref group="note">Portraits in the Anhalt collection were generally poorly catalogued in early inventories</ref> after which it is likely to have passed to Leopold Friedrich (d.&nbsp;1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the H<U+00F4>tel de Gouvernement Provincial, [[Bruges]] at the ''Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien''.<ref name="Exb">"[http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg39/gg39-51-exhibit.html Exhibition History]".
