[[Image:cell differentiation.gif|right|thumb|400px|Embryonic stem cells differentiate into cells in various body organs.  Image from [http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html NCBI].]]'''Cellular differentiation''' is a concept from [[developmental biology]] describing the process by which [[cell (biology)|cells]] acquire a "[[cell type|type]]".  The morphology of a cell may change dramatically during differentiation, but the [[genetic material]] remains the same, with few exceptions.  

A cell that is able to differentiate into many cell types is known as '''''[[pluripotent]]'''''.  These cells are called '''[[stem cell]]s''' in animals and '''[[meristem|meristematic cells]]''' in higher plants.  A cell that is able to differentiate into all [[cell type]]s is known as '''''[[totipotent]]'''''.  In mammals, only the [[zygote]] and early [[embryo]]nic cells are ''[[totipotent]]'', while in plants, many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques.

==Overview==

In most multicellular [[organism]]s, not all cells are alike. For example, cells that make up the [[human]] [[skin]] are different from cells that make up the inner organs. Yet, all of the different cell types in the human body are all derived from a single fertilized egg cell through ''differentiation''. Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized cell becomes specialized into one of the many cells that make up the body, such as a heart, liver, or muscle cell. During differentiation, certain [[gene]]s are turned on, or become activated, while other genes are switched off, or inactivated. This process is intricately [[gene regulation|regulated]]. As a result, a differentiated cell will develop specific structures and perform certain functions.

Differentiation can involve changes in numerous aspects of cell physiology; size, shape, polarity, [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, responsiveness to signals, and [[gene expression]] profiles can all change during differentiation. 

In [[cytopathology]] the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of [[cancer]] progression.  "[[Grading (tumors)|Grade]]" is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.

==Mammalian cell types==
            
Three basic categories of cells make up the mammalian body: [[germ cell]]s, [[somatic cell]]s, and stem cells. Each of the approximately 100,000,000,000,000 (10<sup>14</sup>) cells in an adult human has its own copy, or copies, of the [[genome]], with the only exception being certain cell types that lack nuclei in their fully differentiated state, such as [[red blood cell]]s. The majority of these cells are [[diploid]], meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. This category of cells, called somatic cells, includes most of the cells that make up the human body, such as skin and muscle cells. 

Germ line cells are any line of cells that give rise to [[gametes]]&mdash;eggs and sperm&mdash;and are continuous through the generations. Stem cells, on the other hand, have the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to specialized 
cells. They are best described in the context of normal human development. 
            
Development begins when a [[sperm]] fertilizes an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and creates a single cell that has the potential to form an entire organism. In the first hours after fertilization, this cell divides into identical cells. In humans, approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these cells begin to specialize, forming a hollow sphere of cells, called a [[blastocyst]]. The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells, and inside this hollow sphere, there is a cluster of cells called the inner [[cell mass]]. The cells of the inner cell mass will go on to form virtually all of the tissues of the human body. Although the cells of the inner cell mass can form virtually every type of cell found in the human body, they cannot form an organism. These cells are referred to as [[pluripotent]]. Pluripotent stem cells undergo further [[cell specialization|specialization]] into stem cells that give rise to cells that have a particular function. Examples include blood stem cells that give rise to red blood cells, [[white blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s, and skin stem cells that give rise to the various types of skin cells. These more specialized stem cells are called [[multipotent]]&mdash;capable of giving rise to several kinds of cells, tissues, or structures within organisms.
