'''Margaret Oliphant Wilson Oliphant''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Margaret Oliphant Wilson''') (4 April 1828 <U+2013> 25 June 1897), was a Scottish novelist and historical writer, who usually wrote as '''Mrs. Oliphant'''. Her fictional works encompass "domestic realism, the historical novel and tales of the supernatural".<ref>Oliphant, Margaret. ''Miss Majoribanks.'' Ed. Elisabeth Jay. New York: Penguin Classics, 1999, p. vii.</ref>

==Life==
The daughter of Francis W. Wilson (c.1788<U+2013>1858), a clerk, and his wife, Margaret Oliphant (c.1789<U+2013>1854), she was born at [[Wallyford]], near [[Musselburgh]], [[East Lothian]], and spent her childhood at [[Lasswade]] (near [[Dalkeith]]), [[Glasgow]] and [[Liverpool]]. She constantly experimented with writing as a girl and in 1849 had her first novel published: ''Passages in the Life of Mrs. Margaret Maitland''. This dealt with the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Scottish Free Church]] movement, with which Mr. and Mrs. Wilson both sympathised, and met with some success. It was followed by ''Caleb Field'' in 1851, the year in which she met the publisher [[William Blackwood]] in [[Edinburgh]] and was invited to contribute to the famous ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. The connection was to last for her whole lifetime, during which she contributed well over 100 articles, including, a critique of the character of [[Arthur Dimmesdale]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''.

In May 1852, she married her cousin, Frank Wilson Oliphant, at [[Birkenhead]], and settled at Harrington Square in [[London]]. An artist working mainly in [[stained glass]], her husband had delicate health, and three of their six children died in infancy,<ref>According to Elizabeth Jay, in the introduction of Margaret Oliphant's ''[http://books.google.fr/books?id=S3i4B7wq2xwC&pg=PA203&dq=Margaret+Oliphant+Oliphant+%22british+museum%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Autobiography]'' (published in 2002), p. 9, one of these children died aged one day, another one, Stephen Thomas, died at nine weeks, Marjorie, the other daughter, died aged about eight months. The surviving children were Maggie (died in 1864), Cyril Francis, "Tiddy" (died in 1890) and Francis Romano, "Cecco" (died in 1894). However, ''The Victorian Web'' mentions seven children.See also Elisabeth Jay: Oliphant, Margaret Oliphant... In: ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford: OUP, 2004).

For the sake of his health they moved in January 1859 to [[Florence]], and then to [[Rome]], where Frank Oliphant died. His wife, left almost entirely without resources, returned to England and took up the burden of supporting her three remaining children by her own literary activity.

She had now become a popular writer, and worked with amazing industry to sustain her position. Unfortunately, her home life was full of sorrow and disappointment. In January 1864 her only remaining daughter Maggie died in Rome, and was buried in her father's grave. Her brother, who had emigrated to [[Canada]], was shortly afterwards involved in financial ruin, and Mrs. Oliphant offered a home to him and his children, and added their support to her already heavy responsibilities.

In 1866 she settled at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to be near her sons who were being educated at [[Eton College|Eton]]. That year, her second cousin, [[Annie Louisa Walker]], came to live with her as a companion-housekeeper.<ref name = "AutoElephant">{{cite book | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=S3i4B7wq2xwC&dq=Annie+Louisa+Coghill| title = The autobiography of Margaret Oliphant | editor = Elizabeth Jay | year = 2002 | ISBN = 1-55111-276-0 | publisher=Broadview Press Ltd. | place = Mississauga, Canada}}</ref>  This was her home for the rest of her life, and for more than thirty years she pursued a varied literary career with courage scarcely broken by a series of the gravest troubles. The ambitions she cherished for her sons were unfulfilled. Cyril Francis, the elder, died in 1890, leaving a ''Life of [[Alfred de Musset]]'', incorporated in his mother's ''Foreign Classics for English Readers'', The younger, Francis (whom she called "Cecco"), collaborated with her in the ''Victorian Age of English Literature'' and won a position at the [[British Museum]], but was rejected by [[Sir Andrew Clark, 1st Baronet|Sir Andrew Clark]], a famous physician. Cecco died in 1894. With the last of her children lost to her, she had but little further interest in life. Her health steadily declined, and she died at [[Wimbledon, London]], on 25 June 1897.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E4D91630E132A25754C2A9609C94669ED7CF ''"Death of Mrs. Oliphant: Cancer Ends the Career of the Famous English Novelist and Historian,"''] The New York Times, June 27, 1897.</ref>

In the 1880s she was the literary mentor of the Irish novelist [[Emily Lawless]]. During this time Oliphant wrote
several works of supernatural fiction, including the long [[ghost story]] ''A Beleaguered City'' (1880) and
several short tales, including "The Open Door" and "Old Lady Mary".<ref>[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] , ''Who's Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction''.  Elm Tree Books, 1977. ISBN 0-241-89528-6. (p.142)</ref>

At the time of her death, Oliphant was still working on ''Annals of a Publishing House'', a record of the progress and achievement of the firm of Blackwood, with which she had been so long connected. Her ''Autobiography and Letters'', which present a touching picture of her domestic anxieties, appeared in 1899. Only parts were written with a wider audience in mind: she had originally intended the ''Autobiography'' for her son, but he died before she had finished it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/autobiography/3.html|title=The Problematic Relationship of Autobiographer to Audience|author=George P. Landow|publisher=Victorianweb.org|year=1988|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>

===Revival of interest===
Interest in Mrs. Oliphant's work declined in the 20th century. In the mid-1980s, a small-scale revival was led by the publishers Alan Sutton<ref>''The Curate in Charge'' (1875), reissued in 1985. ISBN 0-86299-327-X.</ref> and [[Virago Press]], centred on the Carlingford series and some similarities of subject-matter with the work of [[Anthony Trollope]].<ref>See, for example, the blurb and introduction (p. xiv) to the 1987 Virago paperback edition of ''The Perpetual Curate''. ISBN 0-86068-786-4.</ref>

[[Penguin Books]] in 1999 published an edition of ''Miss Marjoribanks'' (1866).<ref>ISBN 0-14-043630-8.</ref> ''Hester'' (1873) was reissued in 2003 by [[Oxford World's Classics]].<ref>ISBN 0-19-280411-1.</ref> In 2007<U+2013>2009, the [[Gloucester]] publisher Dodo Press reprinted half a dozen of Oliphant's works. In 2010, both the British Library and [[Persephone Books]] reissued ''The Mystery of Mrs. Blencarrow'' (1890), in the latter case with the novella ''Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund'' (1886),<ref>Persephone site: [http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/pages/titles/index.asp?id=143 Retrieved 30 October 2010.]</ref> and the [[Association for Scottish Literary Studies]] produced a new edition of the novel ''Kirsteen'' (1890).<ref>ASLS site: [http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/Kirsteen.html Retrieved 21 June 2012.]</ref>

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a four-hour dramatisation of ''Miss Marjoribanks'' in August/September 1992 and a four-hour dramatisation of ''Phoebe Junior'' in May 1995. A 70-minute adaptation of ''Hester'' was broadcast on Radio 4 in January 2014.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nh88x</ref>
