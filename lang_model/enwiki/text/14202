'''Kris Eric Johannes McCray''' (born September 24, 1981) is an American [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]]. He was the runner-up of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Liddell vs. Team Ortiz]]''.

==Early life==
McCray was born in [[Germany]] to Calvin and Barbara McCray as the middle child in between his two brothers, Dominic and Thomas.<ref name=UFC>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=82996 |title=Kris McCray <U+2013> TUF's Toughest Ever |accessdate=2010-06-18 |publisher=UFC.com |date=2010-06-17}}</ref><ref name=Bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.krismccray.com/bio.html |title=Kris "Savage" McCray Bio |accessdate=2010-06-21 |publisher=KRISMCCRAY.com |date=2010-06-21}}</ref> He is of African American, Austrian and Mexican descent.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/blog/cagewriter/post/-The-Ultimate-Fighter-recap-Which-coach-has-a-;_ylt=Aouv1XxjeOEl.vEksAj81MMSYo14?urn=mma,237481 Yahoo! Sports - 'The Ultimate Fighter' recap: Which coach has a rabbit foot?]</ref>

Since his father was in the Army and stationed in Germany, McCray lived there, as well as Arizona, for most of his early childhood. He eventually moved to [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], where he graduated from high school at Woodbridge High School in 1998.

McCray attended college at [[George Mason University]], while he was teaching high school wrestling in his spare time. McCray entered the U.S. Army Reserve at age 21, and spent six years in the service.

==Mixed martial arts career==
At age 12, McCray began learning [[Taekwondo]] and [[Karate]]. In high school, McCray was a part of the wrestling team. During his time in the service, McCray began learning Jiu-Jitsu, and upon returning home, he joined Team Gold Medal Grappling, a Lloyd Irvin affiliate.

McCray obtained a perfect 10<U+2013>0 amateur record before turning pro. His pro career has mainly consisted of fights for the Virginia based promotion, Ultimate Warrior Challenge.

===''The Ultimate Fighter''===
McCray was selected as a contestant for the eleventh season of the ''Ultimate Fighter''. Before he could move into the house, McCray had to win his entry fight against [[Cleburn Walker]], where he won via a verbal submission after injuring Walker's shoulder.

He was selected third and fifth overall by Team Punishment, led by Tito Ortiz. For his second fight he was chosen to fight Josh Bryant. The fight was back and forth and after three rounds, Bryant was awarded the decision.

McCray was then selected as one of the season's wildcards. He then faced [[Kyacey Uscola]] in a second chance to get into the quarter finals. In the second round, having controlled a large portion of the fight, McCray was able to submit Uscola with an [[armlock|americana]] and advanced to the quarter finals.

McCray would then face good friend [[Kyle Noke]]. McCray arguably controlled the fight after succeeding in multiple takedown attempts that Noke had little answer to. Noke's submission attempts were also effectively neutralised and McCray pulled off the victory with a unanimous decision after three rounds.

That win advanced McCray into the semi-finals where he would have a rematch with Josh Bryant who had defeated him earlier in the competition. After winning by unanimous decision, McCray moved on to face [[Court McGee]] in the finals to determine the next Ultimate Fighter.

McCray set the new record for total fights competed in during a season, having fought 5 times in total. Dana White commented during the final episode that McCray had fought "literally every Tuesday" since he got in the house.

This advanced him to the [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Liddell vs. Team Ortiz Finale|TUF 11 finale]] where he faced Team Liddell fighter, [[Court McGee]] in the main event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19563/court-mcgee-vs-kris-mccray-named-main-event-for-the-ultimate-fighter-11-finale.mma|title=Court McGee vs. Kris McCray named main event for The Ultimate Fighter 11 Finale|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=June 16, 2010}}</ref>

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
At the finale, McCray lost to McGee via second round submission by way of a rear-naked choke. McCray was out-wrestled in the first and second round eventually giving up his back in the second round. McCray signed a four-fight deal with the UFC.<ref>[http://truefighting.webs.com/apps/blog/show/4177262-kris-mccray-returns-at-ufc-121 Kris McCray returns at UFC 121]</ref>

He moved his camp from Team Gold Medal Grappling in [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Toms River, New Jersey]], with the Renzo Gracie Combat Team.

McCray fought [[John Hathaway]] on March 26, 2011, at [[UFC Fight Night 24]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/john-hathaway-vs-kris-mccray-added-to-ufc-fight-night-24-in-seattle |title=John Hathaway vs. Kris McCray Added to UFC Fight Night 24 in Seattle |publisher=mmaweekly.com|date=January 3, 2011}}</ref> The fight was closely contested throughout.
