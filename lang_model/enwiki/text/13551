'''''Colored''''' is a [[North America]]n euphemism once widely regarded as a polite description of [[black people]] (''i.e.'', persons of [[sub-Saharan]] African ancestry; members of the "Negroid race"). It should not be confused with the more recent term ''people of color'', which attempts to describe all "non-[[white people]]s", not just blacks.  The term ''colored'' in particular (along with ''[[Negro]]'') has fallen out of popular usage in the [[United States]] over the last third of the [[20th century]], and is now archaic and potentially derogatory, except in certain narrow circumstances such as the name of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]]. 

The term "colored" appeared in North America during the colonial era.  A "colored" man halted a runaway carriage that was carrying President [[John Tyler]] on [[March 4]], [[1844]]. In [[1863]], the War Department established the "Bureau of Colored Troops." The first twelve Census counts in the U.S. enumerated "colored" people, who totaled nine million in [[1900]]. The Census counts of [[1910]]&ndash;[[1960]] enumerated "negroes."

Mixed Creoles were sometimes accorded higher status than blacks but were more often considered lesser than people of separate ancestry.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Later, "colored" was used to refer to all blacks, due to the difficulty involved in maintaining these distinctions.

==The term ''people of color'' in the United States==
It is difficult to discuss this term without the discussions of [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[privilege]]. This term has very different meanings in different countries and contexts. Some find this term as offensive as the term ''colored'', on the grounds that it fixes [[whites]] as the benchmark for racial division, fostering an "us versus them" view of [[race relations]]. Proponents of the term maintain that it must be realistically acknowledged that those who have power and benefits from racial privilege in a racist society, as such proponents{{who|date=October 2007}} assume the United States to be, are primarily [[White people|white]].

The historical term ''[[free people of color]]'' refers to people of African descent during slavery who lived in freedom. A related term from the time of slavery is ''[[gens de couleur]]'', a French expression that refers to the free descendants of white French colonists and Africans. Because so many of these people had mixed African and European ancestry, they are sometimes labeled [[mulatto]]. They are also sometimes referred to as [[affranchi]]s.

Some struggle to identify with the term, arguing the word ''color'' merely refers to level of skin [[melanin]], and so fails to define correctly those who are not noticeably non-white or whose racial background includes both races of white and non-white. It should be further noted that terms such as ''colored people'' or ''people of color'' are misnomers; most white people have color in their skin as well, with the exception of [[albinos]].

The term ''women of color'' has been embraced and used to replace the term ''[[minority]] women''. Some also prefer the term ''of color'' to the term ''minority'' because they see it as describing a stance of subjugation and [[objectification]].

==Elsewhere==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term, spelled ''coloured'', has the same meaning; today it is usually used only by older people and is often considered offensive, much as in North America, especially when used as a noun.

The term has also been used variously throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] to refer to people from Africa, India, Pakistan, [[Australian Aborigines]], [[Asians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.

===Coloured in Southern Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the term ''[[coloured]]'' is used exclusively to refer to people of mixed-race, or [[Khoisan]] descent, with the term ''[[Black (people)|black]]'' used for black Africans.  "[[Coloured]]" was one of the racial groups designated under the Apartheid system of racial segregation, along with "Black", "White" and "Indian".  The term is not generally considered offensive in South Africa. Most [[Coloured]] South Africans have a cultural identity distinct both from that of Blacks and Whites; some (particularly those who have non-Coloured parents) may adopt the cultural identity of one (or both) of their parents.

The term ''[coloured]]'' is also used to describe persons of mixed race in [[Namibia]], to refer to those of part Khoisan, part white descent. The [[Baster]]s of Namibia constitute a separate [[ethnic group]] that are sometimes considered a sub-group of the Coloured population of that country. Under South African rule, the policies and laws of apartheid were extended to what was then called [[South West Africa]], and the treatment of Namibian Coloureds was comparable to that of South African Coloureds. 

The term ''coloured'' or ''[[goffal]]'' is used in [[Zimbabwe]], where, unlike [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]], most people of mixed race have African and European ancestry, being descended from the offspring of European men and [[Shona people|Shona]] and [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] women; under white minority rule in the then-[[Rhodesia]], Coloureds had more privileges than black Africans, including full voting rights, but still faced serious discrimination. In [[Swaziland]], the term ''Eurafrican'' is used.
