The use of '''Horses in World War I''' reflected a transitional period in the evolution of armed conflict. During [[World War I]] (1914<U+2013>1918), horse-mounted [[cavalry]] units were initially considered essential elements of military force, but over the course of the war, the perceived value of the [[horses in warfare|horse in war]] changed dramatically, and many traditional functions of horse cavalry were replaced by mechanized armored divisions. Nonetheless, horses played a significant role throughout the war, particularly in the area of logistical support.

All of the major combatants in World War I began the war with cavalry forces. Due to limited success and equipment failures, Germany and Austria-Hungary stopped using them on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] soon after the beginning of the war, although they were used in a limited fashion on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] well into the war. On the [[Allied]] side, the United States used cavalry for a limited period of time, while the United Kingdom continued to use mounted infantry and cavalry charges throughout the war. Though not particularly successful on the Western Front, Allied cavalry had some success in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]], partially because they faced a weaker and less technologically-advanced enemy. Russia used cavalry forces on the Eastern Front, though with limited success.

The largest use of horses in World War I was for logistical support. Horses could travel in mud and on terrain where mechanized vehicles could not. They were used for reconnaissance and carried messengers, as well as for pulling [[artillery]], ambulances and supply wagons. Horses performed many other tasks necessary to the war effort and their presence often increased morale among the soldiers at the front. The value of horses for these tasks and the increased difficulty in replacing them was such that by 1917, it was made known to some troops that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. By the end of World War I even the well supplied American army was lacking horses. Ultimately, because the Allies prevented the import of horses to the [[Central Powers]], a lack of horses contributed to Germany's loss of the war.

Conditions were severe for horses at the front, with horses killed by artillery fire, suffering from skin disorders, and injured by [[poison gas]]. Hundreds of thousands of horses were killed during the war, with many more being treated at veterinary hospitals and sent back to the front. Procuring equine food was a major issue, and Germany lost many horses to starvation due to lack of [[fodder]]. Due to their prevalence in the war, several memorials have been erected to commemorate the horses who died. Artists, including [[Alfred Munnings]], extensively documented the work of horses in the war and horses also featured in the poetry of the war. Author [[Michael Morpurgo]] wrote a novel on a cavalry horse in the war which has subsequently been turned into a play. A January 2010 documentary by the [[History Channel]] also featured the horses of World War I.

Even before the beginning of the war, many British tacticians realized that increasing technology was changing the style of warfare, limiting the use of cavalry, and bringing an end to the era of mounted warfare. However, many cavalry men disagreed, and cavalry regiments remained at the ready throughout the war, despite their limited usefulness. This belief in the usefulness of cavalry resulted in resources being reserved for training and maintaining cavalry regiments that were rarely used, as well as many troops and horses being lost in fruitless charges against enemy machine guns.<ref>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 174-176</ref> Early in the war, cavalry skirmishes were not uncommon, and horse-mounted troops were widely used for reconnaissance.<ref name>Willmott, ''First World War'', p. 46</ref> While Britain's cavalry were trained to fight both on foot and while mounted, most other European cavalry still relied on shock action. There were isolated instances of successful shock combat on the Western Front, where cavalry divisions also provided important mobile fire power, but "cavalry was literally indispensable" on the Eastern front and the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]].<ref name="MH188" /> Even late in the war, cavalry continued to be used. For example, they harassed retreating German forces in 1918 during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], sometimes using both horses and tanks in the same battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/photo-e.aspx?PageId=3.D.2&photo=3.D.2.af&f=%2fcwm%2fexhibitions%2fguerre%2fofficial-art-e.aspx|title=Cavalry and Tanks at Arras, 1918|publisher=Canadian War Museum|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>

Great changes in the tactical use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I. Although cavalry was used with good effect in [[Palestine]], at the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] and [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], generally the mode of warfare changed. Tanks were beginning to take over the role of shock combat.<ref name="Carver123" /> The use of [[trench warfare]], barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete.<ref name="Carver123">Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'', p. 123</ref> In the years following the war, most armies became mechanized, resulting in many of the original cavalry regiments being converted to armored divisions, and light tanks were developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.<ref>Carver, ''Britain's Army in the 20th Century'' pp. 154-57</ref> One historian writes that "the Great War brought the end of cavalry".<ref name=Meyer264>Meyer, ''A World Undone, p. 264</ref> From the [[Middle Ages]] into the nineteenth century, cavalry had dominated battlefields, but beginning as early as the [[American Civil War]] it had been apparent that their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful and made shock charges less efficient. The Western Front of World War I made it clear that cavalry was almost useless against modern artillery, as well as being difficult to transport and supply. Nonetheless, British cavalry officers, much more so than continental European nations, were persistent in using and maintaining cavalry, believing all the way until the end of the war that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns. However, neither of these particular tactics proved successful.<ref name=Meyer264/>

Horse-mounted units were used from the earliest days of the war: On August 22, 1914, the first British shot of World War I in France was fired by a cavalryman [[Edward Thomas (British Army soldier)|Edward Thomas]] of the [[4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards]], near [[Casteau]], during a patrol prior to the [[Battle of Mons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/firstshot_01.shtml|accessdate=2010-01-20|date=November 5, 2009|title=The First Shot: 22 August 1914|publisher=BBC|work=World Wars in-depth}}</ref> Within 19 days of Britain beginning mobilization for war, on August 24, 1914, the [[9th Lancers]], a cavalry regiment led by [[David Campbell (British Army officer)|David Cambell]], engaged German troops with a squadron of [[4th Dragoon Guards]] against German infantry and guns. Campbell obeyed orders to charge, though he believed the more prudent course of action was fighting dismounted. The result of the charge was a British loss of 250 men and 300 horses. On September 7, Campbell's troops charged again, this time toward the German [[1st Guard Dragoons]], another lancer cavalry regiment.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/donkey/campbell.htm|title=Sir David Graham Muschet (<U+2018>Soarer<U+2019>) Campbell|work=Centre for First World War Studies|accessdate=2010-01-18|publisher=University of Birmingham}}</ref> In the same year, the British [[Household Cavalry]] took on their second to last operation that was completed on horseback<U+2014>the [[Allied powers|Allied]] [[Great Retreat|retreat from Mons]]. Upon reaching the [[Marne River]] and encountering trench warfare, horses became a liability. Although entire cavalry divisions were still being formed in Britain, cavalry troops quickly became accustomed to fighting dismounted.<ref name=Braddon187>Braddon, ''All the Queen's Men'', pp. 187-88</ref> In 1917, the Household Cavalry conducted its last mounted charge during a diversionary attack on the [[Hindenburg Line]] at [[Arras]]. Upon orders of [[Field Marshal]] [[Earl Haig]], the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] and the [[Blues and Royals|Blues]] charged into heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire to be slaughtered by the German defenders.<ref name=Braddon187/> In addition, two-thirds of the men of the [[10th Hussars]] were lost in the charge at Arras.<ref name=Ellis176>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', p. 176</ref> British cavalry continued to be used throughout the war, and the last British fatality from enemy action before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] went into effect was a cavalryman named George Edwin Ellison, from C Troop [[Royal Irish Lancers]]. Ellison was shot by a sniper as the regiment moved into [[Mons]] on November 11, 1918.<ref>{{citejournal|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=8198835|title=Voices of the Armistice<U+2014>The unluckiest man|issue=76|journal=Ancestors|page=45|date=December 2008|publisher=[[The National Archives]]/Wharncliffe PublishingLimited|editor=Fowler, Simon |editor-link=Simon Fowler (author)}}</ref>

Despite their lackluster record in Europe, horses were indispensable to the British war effort in Palestine, where [[Field Marshal]] [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] crushed the Turkish armies, with a large percentage of his forces consisting of cavalry. This was viewed by some cavalry tacticians as a vindication of cavalry's usefulness, but others point out that the Turks were outnumbered two to one by late 1918, and were not first-class troops even at the beginning of the offensive. Much of Allenby's tactics were undertaken not by British regular cavalry, but by the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], consisting of a combination of Australian, New Zealander, Indian, and English Yeomanry regiments.<ref>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp. 176-177</ref>

=== Continental Europe ===

[[File:Husaren am San.jpg|thumb|Austrian Hussars somewhere in Russia 1915|alt=A line of horses ridden by men in military uniforms. The horses are moving along a dirt road that runs alongside several multi-story buildings.]]

Before the war began, many continental European armies still considered the cavalry to hold a vital place in their order of battle. Prior to 1914, Germany added thirteen regiments of mounted riflemen, while Russia, Austria and France also expanded their mounted branches.<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 20</ref> The [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Turks]] also used cavalry troops, with one unit even exchanging small arms fire with a submarine crew in the [[Dardanelles]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_8/daring_dardanelles.html|title=Daring the Dardanelles: British Submarines in the Sea of Marmara During World War I||author=Whitman, Edward C.|accessdate=2010-02-20|journal=Underseas Warfare|date=Summer 2000|vol=2|number=4}}</ref>

French cavalry had similar problems with horses on the Western Front as the British.<ref name=Ellis176/> The attitudes of the French toward their horses created additional problems. One writer said, "The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did not occur to him to get off his horse's back whenever he could, so there were thousands of animals with sore backs...". Another example was [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Sordet|General Sordet]], who was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather. By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable due to these issues.<ref>Jarymowycz, ''Cavalry from hoof to track'', pp. 137-138</ref> By early September, with battered men and horses, having abandoned a crucial position in the [[First Battle of the Marne]], Sordet was relieved of command.<ref>Herwig, ''The Marne, 1914'', p. 261</ref>  Later, in a June 1918 charge by French lancers, the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot.<ref name=Ellis176/>

Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry divisions when it entered the war in 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep into the heart of Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], troops led by German Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and Lieutenant-General [[Erich Ludendorff]] surrounded the Russian [[Second Army (Russian Empire)|Second Army]] and destroyed the mounted force of [[Don Cossacks]] that served as the special guard of Russian General [[Alexander Samsonov]].<ref name=Ellis177/> However, other Russian cavalry units were successfully used to harass retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000 men in the Austro-Hungarian [[XIV Tyrolean Corps]], which included the [[6th Mounted Rifle Regiment]].<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 161</ref> In general, Russian regular cavalry fared worse than the special units like the Cossacks, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to travel by train. It took approximately the same number of trains (around 40) to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as it did to transport an infantry division of 16,000.<ref name=Ellis177>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', pp.177-178</ref>

The cavalries of Germany and Austria<U+2013>Hungary faced the same problems with transport and the failure of cavalry tactics as the Russians.<ref name=Ellis178>Ellis, ''Cavalry'', p. 178</ref> Germany initially made extensive use of cavalry, including a lance-against-lance battle with the British in late 1914,<ref name=Campbell/> and an engagement between the British [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Brigade]] and the German [[4th Cavalry Division]] in the leadup to the [[First Battle of the Marne]] in September 1914. That battle ended "decidedly to the disadvantages of the German cavalry", partially due to the use of artillery by the accompanying British [[L (N<U+00E9>ry) Battery Royal Horse Artillery|L Battery]] of [[horse artillery]].<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 107</ref> Thus, the Germans stopped using cavalry on the Western Front not long after the beginning of the war, changing in response to new, more mechanized, battle tactics.<ref name=Ellis178/> They continued to use cavalry to some extent on the Eastern Front, including probes into Russian territory in early 1915.<ref>Meyer, ''A World Undone'', p. 321</ref> The Austrians were forced to quit using cavalry due to large-scale equipment failures. Austrian military saddles were so poorly designed as to rub the skin off the [[back (horse)|back]] of any horse not already hardened to the equipment from parade ground practice, and only few weeks into the war half of all Austrian cavalry mounts were disabled, and the rest nearly so.<ref name=Ellis178/>

=== Canada and the United States ===

[[File:Gasmask for man and horse.jpeg|thumb|left|An American soldier demonstrating a gas mask for his horse.|alt=A man wearing a gas mask and helmet stands next to a tacked up horse wearing a gas mask.]]

When World War I began, [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]], a Canadian cavalry regiment, was mobilized and sent to England for training. Upon deployment, the regiment served as infantry in French trenches during 1915, and were not returned to their mounted status until February 16, 1916. After that, in the defense of the [[Somme]] front in March 1917, mounted troops saw action, and Lieutenant [[Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey|Frederick Harvey]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions. Overall, Canadian cavalry had the same difficulties as other nations in breaking trench warfare deadlocks and were of little use on the front lines. However, during March and April 1918, Canadian cavalry was essential in the open warfare initiated by German offensives that had resulted in retreat by British forces. On March 30, 1918, Canadian cavalry charged German machine gun positions in the [[Battle of Moreuil Wood]]. The charge was made by Lord Strathcona's Horse, led by [[Gordon Flowerdew]], later posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during the charge. Nearly three-quarters of the 100 cavalry participating in the attack were killed or wounded in the attack against 300 German soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/photo-e.aspx?PageId=2.B.1.k&photo=3.D.2.z&f=%2fcwm%2fexhibitions%2fguerre%2fgerman-offensive-e.aspx|title=Charge of Flowerdew's Squadron|publisher=Canadian War Museum|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strathconas.ca/bmenu_history.php|title=History of a Regiment|publisher=Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) Society|accessdate=2009-12-19}}</ref>

By 1916, the [[United States Cavalry]] consisted of 15,424 members organized into 15 regiments, including headquarters, supply, machine-gun and rifle troops.<ref>Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry'', pp. 174-176</ref> Just prior to formally joining the war effort, the US had gained significant experience in 1916 and 1917 during the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] in Mexico, which helped to prepare the US Cavalry for entry into World War I. In May 1917, a month after the US declaration of war, the [[National Defense Act of 1916|National Defense Act]] went into effect, creating the 18th through the 25th US Cavalry regiments, and later that month, twenty more cavalry regiments were created. However, trench warfare and weapons that included machine guns and artillery made cavalry warfare impractical. Thus, on October 1, eight of the new cavalry regiments were converted to field artillery regiments by order of Congress, and by August 1918, twenty [[National Army (USA)|National Army]] horse units were converted to thirty-nine trench mortar and artillery batteries. Some horse units of the [[2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment|2nd]], [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd]], [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th]] and [[15th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|15th]] Cavalry regiments accompanied the US forces in Europe. The soldiers worked mainly as [[groom (horses)|grooms]] and [[farrier]]s, attending to remounts for the artillery, medical corps and transport services. It not until late August 1918 that US cavalry entered combat. A provisional squadron of 418 officers and enlisted men, representing the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and mounted on convalescent horses, was created to serve as scouts and couriers during the [[St. Mihiel Offensive]]. On September 11, 1918, these troops rode at night through [[no mans land]] and penetrated five miles behind German lines. Once there, however, the cavalry was routed and had to return to Allied territory. Despite serving through the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], by mid-October the squadron was removed from the front due to only having 150 men remaining.<ref>Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry'', pp. 179-180</ref>

The [[Australian Light Horse]], combining the mobility of cavalry with the fighting skills of infantry, rode [[Waler horse]]s during their World War I campaign in the Middle East.

The English cavalry officer, Lt Col RMP Preston [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], summed up the Australian Light Horses' performance in his book, ''The Desert Mounted Corps:''

<blockquote>
"<U+2026> (November 16th, 1917) The operations had now continued for 17 days practically without cessation, and a rest was absolutely necessary especially for the horses. Cavalry Division had covered nearly 170 miles<U+2026>and their horses had been watered on an average of once in every 36 hours<U+2026>. The heat, too, had been intense and the short rations, 9<U+00BD> lb of grain per day without bulk food, had weakened them greatly. Indeed, the hardship endured by some horses was almost incredible. One of the batteries of the Australian Mounted Division had only been able to water its horses three times in the last nine days&nbsp;<U+2014> the actual intervals being 68, 72 and 76 hours respectively. Yet this battery on its arrival had lost only eight horses from exhaustion, not counting those killed in action or evacuated wounded. <U+2026> The majority of horses in the Corps were Walers and there is no doubt that these hardy Australian horses make the finest cavalry mounts in the world<U+2026><ref name="ASHS">{{cite web|url=http://www.ashs.com.au/horses/default.asp#The%20Horse%20at%20War|publisher=Australian Stock Horse Society|title=Horses: The Horse at War|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>

There were 13,000 Australian horses remaining at the end of World War I, but due to quarantine restrictions, they could not be shipped back to Australia. Two thousand were designated to be killed due to illness or age, while the remaining 11,000 were sold, most to India as remounts for the British Army.<ref name=ALH/> Of the 136,000 horses shipped from Australia to fighting fronts in the war, only one was returned to Australia. The horse, named Sandy, was the mount of a Major General [[William Throsby Bridges|Sir William Bridges]] who was killed at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. After being in the care of veterinarians in Egypt and England, Sandy was returned to Australia, where he was observed for three months before being returned to the Australian remount service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sandy: The only horse to return from the First World War|publisher=Australian War Memorial|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/horses/sandy.asp|accessdate=2009-12-28}}</ref>

During World War I, [[mule]]s were used to pull ammunition wagons, while horses often drew artillery. Horses were also used to pull ambulances, carry supplies and [[wikt:ordnance|ordnance]], and act as cavalry mounts. Steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness, while the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] used horses to pull cable wagons. The promptness of messenger services and [[Despatch rider|dispatch riders]] depended on their mounts.<ref name=Animals/> The deep mud common in some parts of the front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place. Between six and twelve horses were required to pull each field gun; thousands of horses were employed in this task during the war. In some instances, dummy horses were used to deceive the enemy into misreading the location of troops.<ref name=Animals53/> At the beginning of the war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field-kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades.<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 77</ref>

Horses assisted in moving ammunition and other supplies by wagon though bad conditions. After the April 1917 [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], one Canadian soldier recalled, "the horses were up to their bellies in mud. We'd put them on a picket line between the wagon wheels at night and they'd be sunk in over their fetlocks the next day. We had to shoot quite a number."<ref>Meyer, ''A World Undone, p. 531</ref> The value of horses was known to all.

Prior to [[World War I]], Britain had increased its cavalry reserves after seeing the cavalry feats of mounted [[Boers]] during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899<U+2013>1902).<ref name=Dent61>Dent, ''Cleveland Bay Horses'', pp. 61-64</ref> To meet the need for horses during World War I, Britain imported horses from Australia, Canada, the USA and Argentina, as well as requisitioning them from British civilians. However, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] also ordered that no horses under {{hands|15}} be confiscated, at the request of the children of Britain, who were concerned for the welfare of their [[pony|ponies]]. The British [[Remount Service]], in an effort to improve the supply of potential horses for military use, provided the services of high quality [[stallion]]s to British farmers for breeding their [[mare|broodmares]].<ref name=Animals53>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', p. 53</ref> Smaller [[Cleveland Bay]] horses were used to carry British troopers, while larger members of the breed were used to pull [[artillery]]. Premiums were offered on Cleveland Bay stallions by the British War Office. Although World War I turned out not to be the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were still used to pull artillery, and losses among all horse breeds were high.<ref name=Dent61/> Because of World War I causing a depletion in stock, some breed registries, including that for the Cleveland Bay Horse, opened their registry to new blood, and held inspections to register previously unregistered stock that met the breed standards.<ref name=Dent61/><ref>Dent, ''Cleveland Bay Horses'', p. 52</ref>

The continued resupply of horses was a major issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with a large percentage of them dying due to war-related causes.<ref name=IMH/> In 1914, estimates put Britain's horse population at between 20,000 and 25,000. This required them to call upon the US to help with remount efforts, even before the US had formally entered the war.<ref name=IMH/><ref name=PP>{{cite journal|journal=Past & Present|title=Britain's military use of horses 1914-1918|date=May 1993|author=Singleton, John|pages=178<U+2013>204}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, seriously depleting the country's equine population, and another 182,000 horses were taken overseas with American troops. Only 200 returned to the US, with 60,000 being killed outright.<ref name=IMH/> By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured enough animals to have possession of 591,000 horses and 213,000 mules, as well as almost 60,000 camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent 67.5 million pounds on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade through supplying horses to not only the British Army, but also the Canadians, Belgians, Australians, New Zealanders, Portuguese, and even a few to the United States. Shipping horses between the United States and Europe was both costly and dangerous; [[American Expeditionary Force]] officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500 horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships that were attacked by the Germans.<ref name=PP/>

Due to the high casualty rates, even the well-supplied American army was facing a deficit of horses by the final year of the war. After the [[First United States Army|American First Army]], led by General [[John J. Pershing]], pushed the Germans out of the [[Argonne Forest]] in late 1918, they were faced with a shortage of around 100,000 horses, effectively immobilizing the artillery. When Pershing asked [[Ferdinand Foch]], [[Marshal of France]], for 25,000 horses, he was refused. It was impossible to obtain more from the United States, as shipping space was limited, and Pershing's senior supply officer stated that "the animal situation will soon become desperate."<ref>Gilbert, ''The First World War'', pp. 477-479</ref>

Prior to World War I, Germany had increased its reserves of horses through state-sponsored [[stud farm]]s and annuities paid to individual horse breeders. These breeding programs were designed specifically to provide high-quality horses and mules for the German military. These efforts, and the horse-intensive nature of warfare in the early 20th century, resulted in an increase in the ratio of horses to men in the German army, from one to four in 1870 to one to three in 1914. The breeding programs allowed the Germans to provide all of their own horses at the beginning of the war.<ref name=PP/> The horses were considered army reservists too, as all horse owners had to register them regularly, and the army knew where all horses were at all times. In the first weeks of the war the German army mobilized 715,000 horses and the Austrians 600,000; the Russian military topped them all by gathering over a million horses in August 1914. Overall, the ratio of horses to men among all of the belligerent nations was estimated at one to three.<ref>Keegan, ''The First World War'', p. 73</ref>

However, the only way for Germany to import large numbers of horses after the start of the war was through conquest&nbsp;<U+2014> and through this, over 375,000 horses were taken from German-occupied French territory during the war. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000.<ref name=PP/> The [[Ardennes (horse)|Ardennes]] was used to pull artillery in World War I for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse.<ref name=Pinney>Pinney, ''The Working Horse Manual'', pp. 24-25</ref> The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the [[Belgian (horse)|Brabant]].<ref name=Animals>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', p. 52</ref> However, the Germans were not able to capture the Belgian royal horses, as these were successfully evacuated, though they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction.<ref>Schafer, "Animals, Use of" in ''The European Powers in the First World War'', pp. 52-53</ref> Ultimately, due to the Allies preventing the import of remounts to Germany, the Germans ran out of horses&nbsp;<U+2014> a contributing factor to their loss of the war.<ref name=Animals53/>

== Casualties ==
[[File:British casualties at Le Cateaua.jpg|thumb|British horse and human casualties at Le Cateau|alt=Men and horses lie dead in an open field, near abandoned artillery units and other equipment.]]
For Britain, battle losses of horses contributed approximately 25 percent of the total equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Respiratory diseases, exhaustion and mud-borne diseases accounted for the remainder, although during certain battles cavalry losses were quite heavy. East Africa saw the highest death rates, with 290% of the original stock of animals dying in 1916 alone, mainly due to infection from the [[tsetse fly]]. On average, Britain lost around 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of their animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the [[Crimean War]], 120 percent in the [[Boer War]] and 10 percent in peacetime.<ref name=PP/> During some parts of the war, 1,000 horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. Other horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, would drown in ankle-deep mud&nbsp;<U+2014> too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Horses were considered so valuable that if a soldier's horse was killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof and bring it back to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.<ref name=DailyMail>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1241403/The-horses-won-war-How-harrowing-reality-inspired-Michael-Morpugos-classic-novel.html|work=Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|title=The horses that won us the war: How a harrowing reality inspired Michael Morpugo's classic novel|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 [[Battle of Verdun]] between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun.<ref>Gilbert, ''The First World War'', p. 235</ref> By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdales]], which drew the guns. Over the course of the war, Britain lost over 484,000 horses, one horse for every two men.<ref name="MH417">Holmes, ''Military History'', p. 417</ref>

Feeding horses was a major issue, and horse [[fodder]] was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries,<ref>Keegan, ''A History of Warfare,'' p. 308</ref> including Britain.<ref>Holmes, ''Tommy'', p. 163</ref> Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced due to German submarine activity restricting supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. Germany faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated the amount of food they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories in the east, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.<ref name=PP/>

Many horses died as a result of the conditions at the front&nbsp;<U+2014> of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were stolen after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, [[poison gas]] attacks that injured their [[respiratory system of the horse|respiratory systems]] and skin, and skin conditions such as [[mange]]. When gas warfare was first begun in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks.<ref name=Animals53/> Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display.aspx?id=5159|title=Gas mask for horses, Germany, 1914-1918|publisher=Science Museum, London|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9404E1DB163EE433A25752C0A9609C946996D6CF|title=Gas Masks for Horses; Improved Device Being Made for American Army|accessdate=2010-01-13|journal=New York Times|date=June 1, 1918}}</ref> although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the [[Western Front]].<ref name=Animals53/> During one of the war years, 120,000 horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and [[horse trailer]]s were first developed for use on the [[Western Front]] as equine ambulances.<ref name=IMH>{{cite web|url=http://www.imh.org/history.php?chapter=100|title=1900: The Horse in Transition|publisher=International Museum of the Horse|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>

At the end of the war, many older horses were killed, and younger horses were sold to [[horse slaughter|slaughterhouses]] or to locals, often upsetting soldiers who had to give up their beloved mounts.<ref name=Animals53/> Many of these decommissioned horses were sold to French butchers.<ref name="morpurgo">{{cite journal|author=Morpurgo, Michael|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3668516/War-Horse-When-Horses-were-heroes.html|title=War Horse: When Horses were heroes|journal=The Telegraph (London)|date=October 12, 2007}}</ref>
