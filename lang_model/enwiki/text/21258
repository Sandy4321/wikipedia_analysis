[http://bentonvillek12.org/web/schools/school_profile.asp] The Bentonville Public Schools district has grown dramatically in the last decade, and is now one of the largest districts (by student population) in the state. This growth has encouraged the district to improve its academic, athletic, fine arts, and social programs, and all have been grown in size and quality in recent years. The district saw all of these changes largely under the leadership of superintendent Gary Compton, who took the position in January, 2001. Today, Superintendent Michael Poore leads the district.
