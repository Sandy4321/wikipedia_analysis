"'''Never Let Me Go'''" is a song by English [[indie rock]] band [[Florence and the Machine]] from their second studio album ''[[Ceremonials]]''. The song was written by [[Florence Welch]] and [[Paul Epworth]] while production was handled by Epworth. [[Island Records]] have released the song as the fourth single from the album on 2 April 2012. The band first premiered the song during one of their concerts before the release of the album on 15 October 2011. A [[Clams Casino (musician)|Clams Casino]] remix of the song was placed on the [[12-inch single|12" white vinyl single]] which was available for pre-order on 22 March 2012.

Musically, "Never Let Me Go" is a downtempo [[baroque pop]] and [[indie pop]] ballad completed with [[piano]] and [[drum kit|drums]] while backing vocals repeatedly sing "never let me go" throughout the song. Many critics noted similarities between the song's composition and materials by other artists including [[Enya]], [[Evanescence]] and [[Ryan Tedder]]-produced songs. The song received mostly positive reviews by critics who praised Welch's vocals and its balladry nature.

An accompanying [[music video]] for the song was released online on 7 March 2012. It was directed by [[Queens of Noize|Tabitha Denholm]] and stars actor [[Jamie Campbell Bower]], who plays Welch's love interest. The video features the pair together skating and shots of a dirty water trickling down Welch's face and hands are shown. Upon the release of the video, critics praised Welch's gothic look and the video's dark atmosphere. Florence and the Machine added the song to the [[set list]] of their second worldwide [[Ceremonials Tour]] (2011<U+2013>2012) where the song was performed during the encore of the concerts along with "[[No Light, No Light]]".

{{quote box|width=29%|quote="Of course, given the cavernous, darkly lit spaces the video inhabits, it's also a nice fit to the song's voluminous, dream-like sonics. Truly, a skating rink hasn't looked this moody since, well, ever <U+2014> to the point where you can practically feel the chill running its way up Welch's stockings. And as for Campbell Bower, well, he's plenty icy too... Call it love on ice. Or a darkly spiritual rumination on the politics of figure skating.

The video starts with Welch looking into an ice rink which holds an arcade. A man is seen using the arcade machines as Welch enters, wearing torn, worn away clothing. As the first chorus starts, the ice rink is lit up by the man with spotlights moving around. Several scenes are shown throughout the video of water e.g. an overflowing sink, a floor being mopped, watery footprints on the floor. What looks like dirty water is shown trickling down Welch's face and hands. She walks onto the ice rink and the man enters, leading them to dance with each other and hug. As Florence dances on her own, a cleaner is shown to be watching. Towards the end of the song, Welch looks at the man and starts to fall back, her face and hands engulfed by dirty water as the woman cleaner looks on.

Nick Neyland of ''Prefix Magazine'' compared the video with [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s eponymous novel, ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' (2005).<ref name="pmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/florence-the-machine/never-let-me-go-video/62857/|title=Florence + The Machine: "Never Let Me Go" (Video)|work=Prefix Magazine|first=Nick|last=Neyland|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> Melinda Newman of the website [[HitFix]] praised Welch's [[Gothic (term)|gothic]] look and wrote, "It's spooky and we don't fully understand it.
