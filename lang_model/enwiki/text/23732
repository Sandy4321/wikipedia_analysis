==Creation==

In 1918, the final year of [[World War I]], the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was suffering from an internal crisis caused by unrest amongst its numerous Slavic populations.<ref name="matijevic-2008">{{harvnb|Matijevi<U+0107>|2008}}</ref> The [[South Slavic peoples]] were divided between various subdivisions of the monarchy:
* [[Cisleithania]]: The [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Duchy of Carniola]] and the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] were under Austrian jurisdiction. The neighbouring duchies of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] and the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] also included a significant South Slavic population.
* [[Transleithania]]: The [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Fiume (corpus separatum)]] were under Hungarian jurisdiction. The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] itself included a significant South Slavic populations in [[Prekmurje]], [[Me<U+0111>imurje]], [[Baranja]] and territories that formerly were part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].
* The [[Austro-Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Activities to strengthen pro-Yugoslav forces in the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Transleithania]]n [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] were initiated by the Yugoslav parliamentary club, a group of South Slavic deputies in the ''[[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'' (the Cisleithanian parliament). On 2&ndash;3 March 1918,<ref name=Boban>{{harvnb|Boban|1993}}</ref> a grass-roots meeting was held in [[Zagreb]] that included representatives of various aspects of public life as well as members of several political parties, primarily the [[Star<U+010D>evi<U+0107>'s Party of Rights|Party of Rights]] led by [[Mile Star<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] and the [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]].<ref name="stambuk-skalic-matijevic-2008">{{harvnb|<U+0160>tambuk-<U+0160>kali<U+0107>|Matijevi<U+0107>|2008}}
</ref> Significantly, however, the ruling [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] and its opposition the [[Croatian People's Peasant Party]] were excluded. The meeting produced a joint resolution that proclaimed the unity of the people of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (a "unified nation" with the latter described as equal "tribes" whose peculiar historical positions and desires are to be accommodated), demanded a right of [[self-determination]] and possession of the territory they occupied, including the whole of Cisleithania.<ref name="matijevic-2008"/>

In July and August 1918, the so-called "People's organizations of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs" were formed in [[Split (city)|Split]] (for Dalmatia), [[Su<U+0161>ak, Rijeka|Su<U+0161>ak]] (for the [[Croatian Littoral]]) and [[Ljubljana]] (for the [[Slovene lands]]) to advance these policies. In late August, the Croatia-Slavonia parties met again in Zagreb to discuss how to proceed and, in particular, how to gain the support of the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]].<ref name="matijevic-2008"/>

On September 14, 1918, [[Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister]] [[Stephan Buri<U+00E1>n von Rajecz|Buri<U+00E1>n]] issued a statement advocating a settlement of World War I by peace treaty and it became apparent that the war was coming to an end. By early October, the Slovene-Croat-Serb movement were planning to set up a National Assembly. [[Svetozar Pribi<U+0107>evi<U+0107>]], the leader of the Croat-Serb Coalition, confronted [[Sr<U+0111>an Budisavljevi<U+0107>]], one of the leaders of this movement, in an effort to determine whether these plans were meant to undermine the Coalition, and the two reached an understanding whereby the Coalition would be invited to join any future National Council before a National Assembly was formed. At the same time, the organizers obtained support from the Croatian People's Peasant Party and the [[Serb People's Radical Party]]. On October 5 and 6, a provisional assembly was convened and the formation of executive committees begun. Seats were apportioned to members of all parties,<ref name="stambuk-skalic-matijevic-2008"/> but not without acrimony over the ''[[ad hoc]]'' nature of the proceedings.<ref name="matijevic-2008"/>

Numerous meetings were held during October, during which time [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Karl]]'s proclamation of a manifesto on the [[federalization]] of Cisleithania was rejected. On October 28, [[Gyula Andr<U+00E1>ssy the Younger]] sent a peace note to the American government while the [[Ban of Croatia]], [[Antun Mihalovi<U+0107>]], reported to the Emperor and was dismissed with the instruction "Do as you please".<ref name="matijevic-2008"/> The Ministry of War had also decided to allow the local military commands to approach the people's councils in order to help maintain law and order. All this was taken as a sign that the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was disintegrating and that the State of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was an attainable goal.<ref name="matijevic-2008"/>

===National Council===
[[File:Session of Sabor.jpg|thumb|Session of the Croatian parliament, the ''[[Parliament of Croatia|Sabor]]'', on 29 October 1918.]]
[[File:KongressfallofAH.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in [[Congress Square]], [[Ljubljana]], 29 October 1918.]]
The National Council ({{lang-hr|Narodno vije<U+0107>e}}) was established on 5&ndash;8 October 1918 in Zagreb, as an extension of the decisions reached in March 1918. The Council declared itself a political representative body of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs living in Croatia-Slavonia, Fiume, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Istria]], [[Trieste]], [[Carniola]], [[County of G<U+00F6>rz|G<U+00F6>rz]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Ba<U+010D>ka]], [[Banat]], [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]], [[Me<U+0111>imurje]] and elsewhere in southwest Hungary. The Council established its own Central Committee and Presidency, while one member of the Council was to be representative of a 100,000 people. In addition, it comprised five representatives of Croatian [[Sabor]], Bosnian Parliament and Reichsrat for a total of 95 representatives. 32 voting members were required to form the [[quorum]], and two-thirds majority was needed for any decisions. Members of regional parliaments were allowed to attend as non-voting observers. The Council elected up to 30 Central Committee members, who could appoint further 10 to the committee by a two-thirds vote.<ref name=Boban/>

On 19 October, the National Council responded to declaration of [[Charles I of Austria]] regarding federalization of the monarchy by declaring itself the supreme representative body of all South-Slavic peoples in the monarchy, rejecting the declaration, demanding that the peoples represented by the National Council be included in a single state regardless of existing provincial or state borders. The state was proclaimed officially on 29 October 1918. Its first president was a Slovene, [[Anton Koro<U+0161>ec]]. The two vice presidents were a Serb, [[Svetozar Pribi<U+0107>evi<U+0107>]], and a Croat, [[Ante Paveli<U+0107> (politician born 1869)|Ante Paveli<U+0107>]].<ref name=Boban/>

The new state aspired to include all those territories of the former [[Austria-Hungary]] that were inhabited by Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Those representing the [[History and culture of Serbs in Vojvodina|Serbs in Vojvodina]], however{{spaced ndash}}including those in [[Banat]], [[Ba<U+010D>ka]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]]{{spaced ndash}}objected and formed their own administration under the supreme authority of the Serbian National Board in [[Novi Sad]]. Vojvodina then joined the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on 25 November 1918. One day earlier, on 24 November 1918, the region of [[Syrmia]], which had become part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, seceded and also joined the Kingdom of Serbia.<ref name="corovic-2006">{{sr icon}} [[Vladimir <U+0106>orovi<U+0107>]], ''Ilustrovana istorija Srba (knjiga <U+0161>esta)'', Belgrade, 2006.</ref><ref name="njegovan-2004">{{sr icon}} Drago Njegovan, ''Prisajedinjenje Vojvodine Srbiji'', Novi Sad, 2004.</ref>

==Conflict with Italy==
{{also|Treaty of London (1915)}}
In order to avoid handing them to the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], Emperor Karl assigned the entire [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]], the Austro-Hungarian merchant fleet and all Austro-Hungarian harbours, arsenals and shore fortifications to the National Council. The National Council sent diplomatic notes to the Entente governments notifying them that they had taken control of these assets and were not at war. The fleet, however, was soon attacked and dismembered by the Italian navy, the [[Regia Marina]].

Austria-Hungary reached an armistice with Italy through the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] signed on November 3, 1918. This agreement stipulated that Italy could occupy large parts of the territory that had been included in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italian troops then occupied Istria and much of Dalmatia and remained there until 1921, when the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] came into effect.

==Unification with Serbia==
{{also|Creation of Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Serbian Army enters Zagreb.jpg|thumb|Units of the [[Military history of Serbia|Serbian Army]] enter [[Ban Jela<U+010D>i<U+0107> Square]] in Zagreb, 1918.]]
The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs did not obtain international [[diplomatic recognition]] before it ceased to exist. In a note of 31 October, the National Council informed the governments of the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United States]] that the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs is constituted in the South-Slavic areas formerly within the Austria-Hungary, and that the new state intends to form a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. The same note was sent to the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the Yugoslav Committee in London. Serbia's prime minister [[Nikola Pa<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] responded to the note on 8 November, recognizing the National Council in Zagreb as "legal government of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes living in the territory of the Austria-Hungary", and notified the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States asking them to do the same.

On 23&ndash;24 November, the National Council declared "unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed on the entire, contiguous South-Slavic area of the former Austria-Hungary with the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro into a unified State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs". 28 members of the council were appointed to implement that decision based on National Council's adopted directions on implementation of the agreement of organization of the unified state with the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and representatives of political parties in Serbia and Montenegro. The instructions were largely ignored by the delegation members who negotiated with [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Regent Alexander]] instead. On 1 December, Regent Alexander proclaimed unification of "Serbia with lands of the independent State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into a unified [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. As the National Council ceased to operate, it never formally ratified the proclamation, nor did the Parliament of Serbia, which took note of the declaration on 29 December 1918.<ref name=Boban/>

The National Council's final important task was to appoint representatives to the [[Temporary National Representation]] in early 1919.{{sfn|Matijevi<U+0107>|2008|p=66}}
