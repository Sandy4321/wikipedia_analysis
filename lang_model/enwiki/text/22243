'''New York State Route&nbsp;412''' ('''NY&nbsp;412''') is a [[state highway]] in [[Oneida County, New York]], in the United States. It serves as a connector between [[New York State Route 233|NY&nbsp;233]], which bypasses the village of [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]] to the west, and [[New York State Route 12B|NY&nbsp;12B]], which passes through the village. NY&nbsp;412 is a two-lane highway its entire length. It was assigned in the mid-1930s, originally extending from the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] campus west of NY&nbsp;233 to Clinton. It was cut back to its present length in the early 1950s.
