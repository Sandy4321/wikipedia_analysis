Rockbridge County was established in October, 1777 from parts of now neighboring [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] and [[Botetourt County, Virginia|Botetourt]] counties, and the first county elections were held in May 1778. Rockbridge County was named for [[Natural Bridge (Virginia)|Natural Bridge]], a notable landmark in the southern portion of the county. Rockbridge County was formed during an act of assembly intended to reduce the amount of travel to the nearest courthouse, and to ensure trials were held fairly, and among friends rather than strangers. The first court session in Rockbridge County was held at the home of [[Samuel Wallace]] on April 7, 1778.

[[Cyrus McCormick]] invented the [[reaper]] near Steele's Tavern at the northern end of the county.
