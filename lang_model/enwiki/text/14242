'''''The Adventures of Tintin''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Aventures de Tintin'''}}) is a series of comic albums created by [[Belgium|Belgian]] cartoonist {{lang|fr|[[Georges Remi]]}} (1907<U+2013>1983), who wrote under the pen name of [[Herg<U+00E9>]].  The series is one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century.  By the time of the centenary of Herg<U+00E9>'s birth in 2007,{{sfnm|1a1=Pollard|1y=2007|2a1=Bostock|2a2=Brennan|2y=2007|3a1=The Age 24 May|3y=2006|4a1=Taipei Times 22 May|4y=2007}} ''Tintin'' had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies.{{sfn|Farr|2011|p=4}}

The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]}}'', a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper ''{{lang|fr|[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]}}''.  The success of the series saw the [[serial (literature)|serialised]] strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Soir]]}}'' and spun into a successful ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.  In 1950, Herg<U+00E9> created [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]], which produced the canonical series of twenty-four ''Tintin'' albums.  ''The Adventures of Tintin'' have been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.

The series is set during a largely realistic{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=207<U+2013>208}} 20th century.  Its hero is [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], a young Belgian reporter.  He is aided by his faithful [[Wire Fox Terrier|fox terrier]] dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] (''{{lang|fr|Milou}}'' in the original French edition).  Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash and cynical [[Captain Haddock]], the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired [[Professor Calculus]] ({{lang-fr|Professeur Tournesol|links=no}}), and other supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] ({{lang-fr|Dupont et Dupond|links=no}}).

The series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herg<U+00E9>'s signature {{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}} ("clear line") style.{{sfnm|1a1=Clements|1y=2006|2a1=Wagner|2y=2006|3a1=Lichfield|3y=2006|4a1=Macintyre|4y=2006|5a1=Gravett|5y=2008}}  Its well-researched{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=2003|2a1=Gravett|2y=2005|3a1=Mills|3y=1983}} plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction.  The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of sophisticated satire and political or cultural commentary.

{{quote box|width=250px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="The idea for the character of Tintin and the sort of adventures that would befall him came to me, I believe, in five minutes, the moment I first made a sketch of the figure of this hero: that is to say, he had not haunted my youth nor even my dreams.  Although it's possible that as a child I imagined myself in the role of a sort of Tintin."|source=Herg<U+00E9>, 15 November 1966.{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009|p=19}} }}

Georges Remi<U+2014>best known under the pen name [[Herg<U+00E9>]]<U+2014>was employed as an illustrator at ''{{lang|fr|[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]}}'' ("''The 20th Century''"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, [[social conservatism|conservative]] Belgian newspaper based in Herg<U+00E9>'s native [[Brussels]].  Run by the [[Abb<U+00E9>]] [[Norbert Wallez]], the paper described itself as a "Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information" and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=24|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=20<U+2013>29}}  Wallez appointed Herg<U+00E9> editor of a children's supplement for the Thursday issues of ''{{lang|fr|Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle}}'', titled ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]}}'' ("''The Little Twentieth''").{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=24<U+2013>25|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=31<U+2013>32}}  Propagating Wallez's socio-political views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] sentiment.{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009|p=38}}  In addition to editing the supplement, Herg<U+00E9> illustrated ''{{lang|fr|L'extraordinaire aventure de Flup, N<U+00E9>nesse, Poussette et Cochonnet}}'' ("''The Extraordinary Adventures of Flup, N<U+00E9>nesse, Poussette and Cochonnet''"),{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=44}} a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper's sport staff.  Dissatisfied with this, Herg<U+00E9> wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=12}}

He already had experience creating comic strips.  From July 1926 he had written a strip about a boy scout patrol leader titled ''[[Totor|Les Aventures de Totor C.P. des Hannetons]]'' ("''The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers''") for the [[Scouting]] newspaper ''{{lang|fr|Le Boy Scout Belge}}'' ("''The Belgian Boy Scout''").{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=12}}  Totor was a strong influence on [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]],{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=12|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=25|3a1=Assouline|3a2=Ruas|3y=2009|p=19}} with Herg<U+00E9> describing the latter as being like Totor's younger brother.{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009|p=19}}  Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were "virtually identical" except for the scout uniform,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=29}} also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=19}}  He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles<U+2014>found in such American comics as [[George McManus]]' ''[[Bringing up Father]]'', [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' and [[Rudolph Dirks]]'s ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'', copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter [[L<U+00E9>on Degrelle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1a2=Ruas|1y=2009|1p=17|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=18|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=18}}

[[File:Le Petit Vingtieme, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.jpg|thumb|left|The front page of the 1 May 1930 edition of ''{{lang|fr|Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me}}'', declaring "''{{lang|fr|Tintin revient!}}''" ("Tintin Returns!") from his adventure in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=67}}]]

Although Herg<U+00E9> wanted to send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the [[Soviet Union]], acting as anti-socialist propaganda for children.  The result, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', was [[serial (literature)|serialised]] in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' from January 1929 to May 1930.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1a2=Ruas|1y=2009|1pp=22<U+2013>23|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=34<U+2013>37}}  Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare de Nord station, following which he organised the publication of the story in book form.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=39<U+2013>41}}  The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, and so Wallez granted Herg<U+00E9> two assistants.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1a2=Ruas|1y=2009|1pp=32<U+2013>34|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=42<U+2013>43}}  At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the [[Belgian Congo]].  Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of [[racism]], however at the time was un-controversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1a2=Ruas|1y=2009|1pp=26<U+2013>29|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=45<U+2013>47}}

For the third adventure, ''[[Tintin in America]]'', serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Herg<U+00E9> finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, although used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultra-conservative ideology.{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009|pp=30<U+2013>32}}  ''The Adventures of Tintin'' had been [[print syndication|syndicated]] to French Catholic magazine {{lang|fr|''Coeurs vaillants''}} ("Valiant Hearts") since 1930, and Herg<U+00E9> was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too.{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009|p=35}}

Herg<U+00E9> went on to pen a string of ''Adventures of Tintin'', sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of [[San Theodoros]], the East European kingdom of [[Syldavia]], or the fascist state [[Borduria]]<U+2014>whose leader, M<U+00FC>sstler, was a combination of Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=82}}

===''Le Soir'': 1940<U+2013>1945===

In May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium as World War II broke out across Europe.  Although Herg<U+00E9> briefly fled to France and considered a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to return to his occupied homeland.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=91<U+2013>92}}  To ensure their own dominance, the Nazi authorities closed down ''Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle'', leaving Herg<U+00E9> unemployed.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=90<U+2013>91}}  In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, ''[[Le Soir]]'' (''The Evening''), which was allowed to continue publication under German management.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=92<U+2013>93}}  On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, ''Le Soir Jeunesse'', in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=98<U+2013>99}}  In this new, more repressive political climate, Herg<U+00E9> could no longer explore political themes in his ''Adventures of Tintin'' lest he be arrested by the [[Gestapo]].  As Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=147}}

===''Le Journal de Tintin'': 1946<U+2013>1983===
At the end of the war, in September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] entered Brussels and Herg<U+00E9>'s German employers fled. ''Le Soir'' was shut down and ''The Adventures of Tintin'' was put on hold.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=166}}
Then in 1946, Herg<U+00E9> accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher [[Raymond Leblanc]] and his new publishing company [[Le Lombard]] to continue ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in the new ''{{lang|fr|Le journal de Tintin}}'' (''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine).{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=173}}
While elated to have his work published again, Herg<U+00E9> quickly learned that if ''Tintin'' magazine was his deliverer, it was also his demanding employer.  He no longer had the independence he preferred; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc's magazine<U+2014>a tall order.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=174}}
Despite this, Herg<U+00E9>'s dedication to detail continued, his artistic standards escalated,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=176, 174}} even as his pressures mounted.

Finally, in 1950, Herg<U+00E9> began to poach the better members of the ''Tintin'' magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=194}}  [[Bob De Moor]] (who imitated Herg<U+00E9>'s style and did half the work),{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=194}} Guy Dessicy (colourist), and Marcel DeHaye (secretary) were the nucleus.  To this, Herg<U+00E9> added [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]], [[Roger Leloup]], [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], Eug<U+00E8>ne Evany (later chief of the Studios),{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=173}} Michel Demaret (lettering), and Baudouin Van Den Branden (secretary).{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=202-203}}
As Tintinologist Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating ''The Adventures of Tintin'' into a "veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Herg<U+00E9> conducting."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=203}}
The Studios produced eight new Tintin albums for ''Tintin'' magazine, coloured and reformatted several old Tintin albums, and ultimately completed twenty-three albums of the canon series.  
Studios Herg<U+00E9> continued to release additional publications until Herg<U+00E9>'s death in 1983.  In 1986, a twenty-fourth [[Tintin and Alph-Art|unfinished album]] was released, the Studios were disbanded, and its assets were transferred to the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=289}}  
Bolstered by [[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|recent adaptations]], ''The Adventures of Tintin'' continue to entertain new generations of Tintin fans today.

=== Characters ===
{{Main|List of The Adventures of Tintin characters}}

==== Tintin and Snowy ====
{{Main|Tintin (character)|Snowy (character)}}

{{quote box|width=250px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Everybody wants to be Tintin: generation after generation.  In a world of [[Rastapopoulos]]es, [[R.W. Trickler|Tricklers]] and [[Laszlo Carreidas|Carreidases]]<U+2014>or, more prosaically, [[Jolyon Wagg]]s and [[Mr. Bolt|Bolt-the-builders]]<U+2014>Tintin represents an unattainable ideal of goodness, cleanness, authenticity."|source=Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]], 2006{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|pp=160<U+2013>161}} }}

Tintin is a young Belgian reporter who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day.  The ''Adventures'' may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story.  He is a boy of neutral attitudes with whom the audience can identify; in this respect, he represents the [[everyman]].

Readers and critics have described Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent and imaginative character, noting that his rather neutral personality<U+2014>sometimes labelled as bland<U+2014>permits a balanced reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness, which surrounds him.  His [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]] ideals, which represent Herg<U+00E9>'s own, are never compromised by the character, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist.{{sfn|Walker|2005}}  Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with [[Scott McCloud]] noting that it "allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world."{{sfn|McCloud|1993}}

Snowy (''Milou'' in Herg<U+00E9>'s original version), a [[Wire Fox Terrier|fox terrier]] dog, is Tintin's loyal, four-legged companion.  The bond between Snowy and Tintin is very deep, as they have saved each other from perilous situations many times.  Snowy frequently "speaks" to the reader through his thoughts (often displaying a dry sense of humour), which are not heard by the human characters in the story.  Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion, particularly when distracted by a bone.  Like Captain Haddock, he is fond of [[Loch Lomond distillery|Loch Lomond]] brand [[Scotch whisky]], and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble.  When not distracted, Snowy is generally fearless, his only fear being [[arachnophobia]].

==== Captain Haddock ====
{{Main|Captain Haddock}}

Captain Archibald Haddock (''Capitaine Haddock'' in Herg<U+00E9>'s original version), a [[Merchant Navy|Merchant Marine]] [[sea captain]] of disputed ancestry (he may be of Belgian, French, English, or Scottish origin), is Tintin's best friend.  Introduced in ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', Haddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure captured by his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]].  The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic.  Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion [[Marlinspike Hall]].

Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as "billions of blue blistering barnacles" or "ten thousand thundering typhoons", "[[bashi-bazouk]]", "[[visigoths]]", "[[kleptomania]]c", or "[[Sea cucumber|sea gherkin]]", but nothing actually considered a swear word.  He is a hard drinker, particularly fond of rum and of Scotch whisky, especially [[Loch Lomond distillery|Loch Lomond]]; his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect.

==== Professor Calculus ====
{{Main|Professor Calculus}}

Professor Cuthbert Calculus (''Professeur Tryphon Tournesol'' in Herg<U+00E9>'s original version), an [[Absent-mindedness|absent-minded]] and half-[[Deafness|deaf]] [[physicist]], is a regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock.  He was introduced in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', and based partially on {{lang|fr|[[Auguste Piccard]]}}, a Swiss physicist.{{sfn|Horeau|2004}}  His presence was initially not welcomed by the leading characters, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them.  Eventually, by the end of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall.  Despite his deafness, Calculus has a tendency to act in an aggressive manner, especially when Captain Haddock accuses him of "acting the goat".  He is a fervent believer in [[dowsing]], and carries a [[pendulum]] for that purpose.  Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible.  He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only a little hard of hearing in one ear.

==== Supporting characters ====
Herg<U+00E9>'s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been compared with that of the characters of [[Charles Dickens]].{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=4}}  Herg<U+00E9> used the supporting characters to create a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] world{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=207<U+2013>208}} in which to set his protagonists' adventures.  To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series.  The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Herg<U+00E9> forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations.  As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.{{sfn|Yusuf|2005}}

* [[Thomson and Thompson]] (Dupont et Dupond in Herg<U+00E9>'s original version) are two incompetent detectives who look like identical twins whose only discernible difference is the shape of their moustaches.{{sfn|How to tell a Thompson from a Thomson|2006}}  First introduced in ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'', they provide much of the [[comic relief]] throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic [[spoonerism]]s, are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character, but in spite of this they somehow get entrusted with delicate missions.  The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks, except when abroad; during those missions they insist on wearing the stereotypical [[national costume|costume]] of the locality they are visiting so that they blend into the local population, but instead manage to dress in folkloric attire that actually makes them stand apart.  The detectives were in part based on Herg<U+00E9>'s father Alexis and uncle L<U+00E9>on, identical twins who often took walks together wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.

* [[Bianca Castafiore]] is an opera singer whom Haddock absolutely despises.  She was first introduced in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' and  seems to be popping up wherever Haddock goes, along with her maid [[Irma (comics)|Irma]] and pianist [[Igor Wagner]].  She is comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, and talkative, and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud.  Her speciality is the Jewel Song (''{{lang|fr|Ah! Je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir}}'') from {{lang|fr|[[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]]}} opera, ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', and sings this at the least provocation, much to Haddock's dismay.  She tends to be melodramatic in an exaggerated fashion and is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant.  She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; "Haddock" is frequently replaced by [[malapropism]]s such as "[[Paddock]]", "[[Stopcock]]", or "[[Hopscotch]]", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with "Chestor" and "Hector." Her own name means "white and chaste flower," a meaning to which Professor Calculus refers when he offers a white rose to the singer in ''The Castafiore Emerald''.  She was based upon opera [[diva]]s in general (according to Herg<U+00E9>'s perception), Herg<U+00E9>'s Aunt Ninie (who was known for her "shrill" singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on [[Maria Callas]].{{sfn|Farr|2004}}

* Other recurring characters include [[Nestor (comics)|Nestor]] the butler, [[Chang Chong-Chen|Chang]] the loyal Chinese boy, [[Rastapopoulos]] the criminal mastermind, [[Jolyon Wagg]] the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, [[General Alcazar]] the South American dictator, [[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah]] the Arab emir and his mischievous son, [[Doctor M<U+00FC>ller]] the evil Nazi German doctor, [[Oliveira de Figueira]] the friendly salesman who can sell even the most trivial of items, [[Cutts the butcher]] whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock's, and [[Allan Thompson (comics)|Allan]] the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock's first mate.

=== Settings ===
{{Main|Settings in The Adventures of Tintin}}

The settings within ''Tintin'' have also added depth to the strips.  Herg<U+00E9> mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, along with a base in Belgium from where the heroes set off<U+2014>originally 26 Labrador Road, but later [[Marlinspike Hall]].  This is best demonstrated in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'', in which Herg<U+00E9> creates two fictional countries, [[Syldavia]] and [[Borduria]], and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline.{{sfn|Thompson|2003}}  Other fictional lands include [[Khemed]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[San Theodoros]], [[S<U+00E3>o Rico]], and [[Nuevo Rico]] in South America, as well as the kingdom of Gaipajama in India.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|p=187}}  Along with these fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Nepal, Tibet, and China.  Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.

== Research ==
Herg<U+00E9>'s extensive research began with ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''; Herg<U+00E9> stated, "It was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers".{{sfn|Gravett|2005}}

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures.  These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime.  Pierre Skilling has asserted that Herg<U+00E9> saw monarchy as "the legitimate form of government", noting that democratic "values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip".{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=173<U+2013>234}}  Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Herg<U+00E9> creating a history, customs, and a language, which is actually a Slavian-looking transcript of [[Marols]], the Flemish dialect of Brussels.  He set the country in the [[Balkans]], and it is, by his own admission, modelled after [[Albania]].{{sfn|Assouline|Ruas|2009}}  The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring [[Borduria]] with an attempted annexation appearing in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]''.  This situation parallels the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian conquest of Albania]] and of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Austria]] by expansionist [[Nazi Germany]] prior to World War II.{{sfn|Ewing|1995}}

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin's voyage to the moon in the two-part storyline spread across ''[[Destination Moon (comics)|Destination Moon]]'' and ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''.  His research for the storyline was noted in ''[[New Scientist]]'': "The considerable research undertaken by Herg<U+00E9> enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future [[Exploration of the Moon|Moon exploration]], although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark".  The moon rocket is based on the German [[V-2]] rockets.{{sfn|Pain|2004}}

== Influences ==
In his youth, Herg<U+00E9> admired {{lang|fr|[[Benjamin Rabier]]}} and suggested that a number of images within ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' reflected this influence, particularly the pictures of animals.  {{lang|fr|Ren<U+00E9> Vincent}}, the [[Art Deco]] designer, also had an impact on early Tintin adventures: "His influence can be detected at the beginning of the ''Soviets'', where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an 'S'."{{sfn|Moura|1999}}  Herg<U+00E9> also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the image of round noses from [[George McManus]], feeling they were "so much fun that I used them, without scruples!"{{sfn|Sadoul|Didier|2003}}

During the extensive research Herg<U+00E9> carried out for ''The Blue Lotus'', he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and [[woodcut]]s.  This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coatantiec|1y=2005|2a1=The Great Wave|2y=2006}}

Herg<U+00E9> also declared [[Mark Twain]] an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting [[Inca Empire|Incas]] as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'', an error T.&nbsp;F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray "Incas in awe of a latter-day '[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|Connecticut Yankee]]'".{{sfn|Mills|1983}}

== Translation into English ==

===British===
Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly British children's comic ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' in 1951.{{refn|group=nb|Tintin first appeared in ''Eagle'' Vol 2:17 (3 August), which ran in weekly parts in the lower half of the centerfold, beneath the cutaway drawings, until Vol 3:4 (2 May 1952).}}{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=109}}  It was translated in conjunction with [[Casterman]], Tintin's publishers, and starts by describing Tintin as "a French boy".  Snowy was called by his French name "Milou".{{sfnm|1a1=Corn|1y=1989|2a1=The Times 4 August|2y=2009}}

The process of translating Tintin into [[British English]] was then commissioned in 1958 by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], Herg<U+00E9>'s British publishers.  It was a joint-operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner,{{sfnm|1a1=The Daily Telegraph 14 August|1y=2009|2a1=The Times 4 August|2y=2009}} working closely with Herg<U+00E9> to attain an accurate translation as true as possible to the original work.{{sfn|Owens 10 July|2004}}  Due in part to the large amount of language-specific [[word play]] (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on [[Professor Calculus]]' partial deafness, it was always the intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right.  Despite the free hand Herg<U+00E9> afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Herg<U+00E9>'s intentions.{{sfn|Owens 10 July|2004}}

The British translations were also Anglicised to appeal to British customs and values.  Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators' discretion.  Captain Haddock's {{lang|fr|Le ch<U+00E2>teau de Moulinsart}} was renamed [[Marlinspike Hall]].{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=106}}

When it came time to translate ''[[The Black Island]]'', which is set in [[Great Britain]], the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were [[Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom|unarmed]] and ensuring scenes of the British [[countryside]] were more accurate for discerning British readers.{{sfn|Owens 10 July|2004}}  Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]] to rework it completely.  The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=72}}  {{As of|2013|alt=As of the early 21st century}}, [[Egmont Group|Egmont]] publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.{{sfn|Egmont Group|2013}}

===American===
Unlike in the United Kingdom, the ''Tintin'' books have had limited popularity in the United States.{{sfn|BBC News 9 January|2009}}

The works were first adapted for the [[American English]] market by [[Golden Books]], a branch of the [[Western Publishing Company]] in the 1950s.  The albums were translated from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons.  This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races.{{sfn|A personal website (Netherlands)|2006}}  The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order.{{sfn|Owens 1 October|2004}}  The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Herg<U+00E9> to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.{{sfn|Owens 1 October|2004}}

From 1966 to 1979, ''[[Children's Digest]]'' included monthly instalments of ''The Adventures of Tintin''.  These serialisations served to increase Tintin's popularity, introducing him to many thousands of new readers in the US.{{refn|group=nb|At that time, ''Children's Digest'' had a circulation of around 700,000 copies monthly.}}{{sfn|Owens 1 October|2004}}

[[The Atlantic Monthly|Atlantic Monthly Press]], in cooperation with [[Little, Brown and Company]] beginning in the 1970s, republished the albums based on the British translations.  Alterations were made to vocabulary not well known to a non-British audience (such as [[gaol]], [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]], [[saloon (car)|saloon]], and [[wrench|spanner]]).  {{As of|2013|alt=As of the early 21st century}}, Little, Brown and Company (owned by the [[Hachette Book Group USA]]) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States.{{sfn|Hachette Book Group|2013}}

== Reception ==

=== Awards ===
On 1 June 2006, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] bestowed the [[International Campaign for Tibet]]'s [[Light of Truth Award]] upon the character of Tintin, along with South African Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].{{sfn|BBC News 2 June|2006}}  The award was in recognition of Herg<U+00E9>'s book ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', which the Executive Director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was "for many ... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet".{{sfn|Int'l Campaign for Tibet 17 May|2006}}  In 2001, the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work, which had been released with the title ''Tintin in China's Tibet''.  The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title.{{sfn|BBC News 22 May|2002}}  Accepting on behalf of the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation, Herg<U+00E9>'s widow Fanny Rodwell stated, "We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later".{{sfn|BBC News 2 June|2006}}

=== Tintinology and literary criticism ===
{{Main|List of books about Tintin}}

The study of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' is known as Tintinology, with its followers varyingly known as Tintinologists, Tintinophiles, Tintinolators, Tintinites, or Herg<U+00E9>logues.{{sfnm|1a1=Wagner|1y=2006|2a1=Freer|2y=2010}}  One notable Tintinologist is the Belgian [[Philippe Goddin]], who published ''Herg<U+00E9> et Tintin reporters: Du Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me au Journal Tintin'' (1986, later republished in English as ''Herg<U+00E9> and Tintin Reporters: From "Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me" to "Tintin" Magazine'' in 1987) and ''Herg<U+00E9> et les Bigotudos'' (1993) amongst other books on the series.  In 1983, [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] published ''Le Monde d'Herg<U+00E9>'', subsequently published in English as ''[[Tintin and the World of Herg<U+00E9>]]'' in 1988.{{sfn|Peeters|1989}}  Although Goddin and Peeters were native French-speakers, the English reporter [[Michael Farr]] also published works on Tintinology such as ''Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure'' (1989), ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'' (2001),{{sfn|Farr|2001}} ''Tintin & Co.'' (2007){{sfn|Farr|2007}} and ''The Adventures of Herg<U+00E9>'' (2007),{{sfn|Farr|2011}} as had English screenwriter [[Harry Thompson]], the author of ''Tintin: Herg<U+00E9> and his Creation'' (1991).{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}} }}

[[Literary criticism|Literary critics]], primarily in French-speaking Europe, have also examined ''The Adventures of Tintin''.  In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s published his study of the ''Adventures of Tintin'' from a more "adult" perspective as ''Les M<U+00E9>tamorphoses de Tintin'', although it would only appear in English as ''The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults'' in 2010.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2009}}  In reviewing Apostolid<U+00E8>s' book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of ''[[The New Republic]]'' thought that it was "not for the faint of heart: it is densely-packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon."{{sfn|Perl-Rosenthal|2010}}  Following Apostolid<U+00E8>s's work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books ''Tintin et les Secrets de Famille'' ("Tintin and the Family Secrets"), which was published in 1990,{{sfn|Tisseron|1990}} and ''Tintin et le Secret d'Herg<U+00E9>'' ("Tintin and Herg<U+00E9>'s Secret"), published in 1993.{{sfn|Tisseron|1993}}

The first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was ''Tintin and the Secret of Literature'', written by the novelist [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] and published in 2006.  In this book, McCarthy compares Herg<U+00E9>'s work with that of [[Aeschylus]], [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Henry James]] and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007|p=10}}  McCarthy considered the ''Adventures of Tintin'' to be "stupendously rich",{{sfn|McCarthy|2007|p=8}} containing "a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text"{{sfn|McCarthy|2007|p=32}} which, influenced by Tisseron's psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from [[bartering]]{{sfn|McCarthy|2007|pp=13<U+2013>14}} to implicit sexual intercourse{{sfn|McCarthy|2007|pp=106<U+2013>109}} that Herg<U+00E9> had featured throughout the series.  Reviewing the book in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Toby Clements argued however that McCarthy's work, and literary criticism of Herg<U+00E9>'s comic strips in general, cut "perilously close" to simply feeding "the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive" in the Tintinological community.{{sfn|Clements|2006}}

=== Controversy ===
[[File:Tintin in the Congo - Rhino.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The early works of ''Tintin'' naively depicted controversial images.  Later, Herg<U+00E9> called his actions "a transgression of my youth." Herg<U+00E9> substituted the sequence with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=38,49}}]]

The earliest stories in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' have been criticised{{sfnm|1a1=BBC News 28 April|1y=2010|2a1=Beckford|2y=2007}} for displaying [[racism|racial stereotypes]], animal cruelty, violent, [[colonialism|colonialist]], and even fascist leanings, including [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans.  While the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation has presented such criticism as na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>,{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}} }} and scholars of Herg<U+00E9> such as Harry Thompson have said that "Herg<U+00E9> did what he was told by the [[Norbert Wallez|Abb<U+00E9> Wallez]]",{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}} }}  Herg<U+00E9> himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice, stating, "I was fed the prejudices of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society that surrounded me."{{sfn|Sadoul|Didier|2003}}

In ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', the [[Bolshevik]]s were presented as villains.  Herg<U+00E9> drew on ''Moscow Unveiled'', a work given to him by Wallez and authored by [[Joseph Douillet]], the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime, although Herg<U+00E9> contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout Catholic nation, "Anything Bolshevik was [[atheism|atheist]]".{{sfn|Sadoul|Didier|2003}}  In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated by personal greed and a desire to deceive the world.  Tintin discovers, buried, "the hideout where [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] have collected together wealth stolen from the people".  Herg<U+00E9> later dismissed the failings of this first story as "a transgression of my youth."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}} }}  By 1999, even while Tintin's politics was the subject of a debate in the French parliament,{{sfn|BBC News 4 February|1999}} part of this presentation was noted as far more reasonable, with British weekly newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' declaring, "In retrospect, however, the land of hunger and tyranny painted by Herg<U+00E9> was uncannily accurate".{{sfn|The Economist 28 January|1999}}

''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'' has been criticised as presenting the [[Belgian Congo|Africans]] as na<U+00EF>ve and primitive.{{sfn|BBC News 17 July|2007}}  In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children.  "My dear friends," he says, "I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium."{{refn|group=nb|{{lang-fr|"''Mes chers amis, je vais vous parler aujourd'hui de votre patrie: La Belgique.''"|links=no}} }}  Herg<U+00E9> redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics.{{sfnm|1a1=Cendrowicz|1y=2010|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=25}}  Herg<U+00E9> later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, "I portrayed these Africans according to ... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time."{{sfn|Sadoul|Didier|2003}}  Sue Buswell summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988{{sfn|Buswell|1988}} as "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals",{{refn|group=nb|"Dead animals" refers to the fashion for big-game hunting at the time of the work's original publication.}} although Thompson noted this quote may have been "taken out of context".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p={{page needed|date=May 2013}} }}

Drawing on [[Andr<U+00E9> Maurois]]' ''Les Silences du colonel Bramble'', Herg<U+00E9> presents Tintin as a [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]], accidentally killing fifteen [[antelope]] as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal.  However, concerns over the number of dead animals led ''Tintin''{{'}}s Scandinavian publishers to request changes.  A page of Tintin killing a [[rhinoceros]] by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Herg<U+00E9> substituted the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he slept under a tree.{{sfn|Farr|2001}}  In 2007, the UK's [[Commission for Racial Equality]] called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating, "It beggars belief that in this day and age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display ''Tintin in the Congo''."{{sfnm|1a1=Beckford|1y=2007|2a1=BBC News 12 July|2y=2007}}  In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people.  Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court.{{sfnm|1a1=Samuel|1y=2011|2a1=BBC News 13 February|2y=2012}}  Belgium's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against "over-reaction and hyper [[political correctness]]".{{sfn|Vrielink|2012}}

[[File:Bohlwinkel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mr. Bohlwinkel]] ]]

Herg<U+00E9> altered some of the early albums in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers.  For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the African characters in ''[[Tintin in America]]'' were re-coloured to make their race [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] or ambiguous.{{sfn|Mills|1996}}  ''The Shooting Star'' originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of "Blumenstein".  This proved controversial, as the character exhibited exaggerated, [[stereotype|stereotypically]] Jewish characteristics.  "Blumenstein" was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]], in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a [[fictional country]] <U+2013> S<U+00E3>o Rico.  Herg<U+00E9> later discovered that 'Bohlwinkel' was also a Jewish name.{{sfn|Ewing|1995}}

== Adaptations and memorabilia ==
{{Main|Tintin books, films, and media}}

''The Adventures of Tintin'' has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections.  Herg<U+00E9> encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films.  After Herg<U+00E9>'s death in 1983, the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]] and [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation#Moulinsart|Moulinsart]], the foundation's commercial and copyright wing, became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=289|2a1=Tintin.com Moulinsart|2y=2010}}

=== Television and radio ===
Two animated television adaptations have been made.  
* ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Les aventures de Tintin d'apr<U+00E8>s Herg<U+00E9>}}'') (1957) <U+2013> The first production of [[Belvision Studios]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=143<U+2013>144}}  Ten of Herg<U+00E9>'s books were adapted, each [[serial (radio and television)|serialised]] into a set of five-minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced.{{refn|group=nb|Two series were created.  Series 1: Two books, twelve episodes, were adapted in black and white as a test of the studio's abilities; these were actually faithful to the original albums.  Series 2: Eight books, 91 episodes, were adapted in colour; these were often unfaithful to the original albums.  The animation quality of the series was very limited.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=143<U+2013>144}} }}  The series was directed by [[Ray Goossens]] and written by Belgian comic artist [[Greg (comics)|Greg]], later editor-in-chief of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine, and produced by [[Raymond Leblanc]].{{refn|group=nb|Belvision had just been launched by [[Raymond Leblanc]], who had created ''Tintin'' magazine a decade earlier.}}  Most stories in the series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=143<U+2013>144}}
* ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Les aventures de Tintin}}'') (1991<U+2013>92) <U+2013> The second and more successful television series, the adaptation of twenty-one ''Tintin'' books.{{refn|group=nb|The series ran for three seasons, 13 episodes each season; the 21 stories usually presented in two-part segments.}}{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=148}}  It was directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi and was produced by [[L<U+00E9> Studio Ellipse|Ellipse]] (France) and [[Nelvana Limited|Nelvana]] (Canada) on behalf of the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation.  The series adhered closely to the albums to such an extent that panels from the original were often transposed directly to the screen.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=148}}  The series aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD.  It aired in the US on [[HBO]].{{sfn|Baltimore Sun 16 November|1991}}

One radio adaptation has been made.
* ''The Adventures of Tintin'' <U+2013> The [[BBC]] produced two ''Tintin'' radio series in 1992 and 1993 starring [[Richard Pearce (British actor)|Richard Pearce]] as Tintin and [[Andrew Sachs]] as Snowy.  Captain Haddock was played by [[Leo McKern]] in Series One and [[Lionel Jeffries]] in Series Two, Professor Calculus was played by [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] and Thomson and Thompson were played by [[Charles Kay]].

=== Cinema ===
Five feature-length ''Tintin'' films were made before Herg<U+00E9>'s death in 1983. Nearly four decades later, a new [[Hollywood]] movie was released.
* ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Le crabe aux pinces d'or}}'') (1947) <U+2013> The first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film.  Written and directed by Claude Misonne and Jo<U+00E3>o B Michiels, the film was a stop-motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=143}}

* ''[[Tintin and the Golden Fleece]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Tintin et le myst<U+00E8>re de la Toison d'Or}}'') (1961) <U+2013> A French live action film was released, adapted not from one of Herg<U+00E9>'s ''Adventures of Tintin'' but instead from an original script written by Andr<U+00E9> Barret and R<U+00E9>mo Forlani.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=144<U+2013>145}}  Directed by Jean-Jacques Vierne and starring [[Jean-Pierre Talbot]] as Tintin and [[Georges Wilson]] as Haddock, the plot involves Tintin travelling to Istanbul to collect the ''Golden Fleece'', a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend, Themistocle Paparanic.  Whilst in the city however, Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship, believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=144<U+2013>145}}

* ''[[Tintin and the Blue Oranges]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Tintin et les oranges bleues}}'') (1964) <U+2013> The success of the first Tintin live action film led to a second being released.  Again based upon an original script, once more by Andr<U+00E9> Barret, it was directed by Philippe Condroyer and starred Talbot as Tintin and [[Jean Bouise]] as Haddock.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=145<U+2013>146}}  The plot reveals a new invention, the blue orange, that can grow in the desert and solve world famines, devised by Calculus' friend, the Spanish Professor Zalamea.  An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus, and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=145<U+2013>146}}

* ''[[Tintin and the Temple of the Sun]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Tintin et le temple du soleil}}'') (1969) <U+2013> The next feature film would be animated and based upon two of Herg<U+00E9>'s ''Adventures of Tintin'': ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' and ''Prisoners of the Sun''.  The first full-length, animated film from Raymond Leblanc's Belvision, which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rauber]].

=== Documentaries ===
One documentary about ''Tintin'' was made during Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime.  Years After Herg<U+00E9>'s death, a new documentary about Tintin and Herg<U+00E9> was released.
* ''[[I, Tintin]]'' (''{{lang|fr|Moi, Tintin}}'') (1976) <U+2013> Produced by Belvision Studios and Pierre Film.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=150}}

This documentary was based on the taped interview with Herg<U+00E9> by [[Numa Sadoul]] from 1971.  Although the interview was published as a book, Herg<U+00E9> was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised.{{sfn|Christensen|2003}}  Years after Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the filmmaker returns to the original tapes and restores Herg<U+00E9>'s often personal, insightful thoughts<U+2014>and in the process brings viewers closer to the world of Tintin and Herg<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=150}}  It was broadcast in the United States on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network, 11 July 2006.{{sfn|PBS July|2006}}

=== Theatre ===
Herg<U+00E9> himself helped to create two [[Play (theatre)|stage plays]], collaborating with humourist [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]].  ''Tintin in the Indies: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond'' (1941) covers much of the second half of ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'' as Tintin attempts to rescue a stolen blue diamond.  ''The Disappearance of Mr. Boullock'' (1941<U+2013>1942) has Tintin, Snowy, and Thomson and Thompson track the mysterious Mr. Boullock around the world and back to Brussels again.  The plays were performed at the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert|Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Royal des Galeries]] in Brussels.  The scripts of the plays are unfortunately lost.{{sfnm|1a1=Sadoul|1y=1975|1p=143|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=132<U+2013>133,142|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3pp=148<U+2013>149}}

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays appeared at the [[Arts Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] of London, adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company. These were ''Tintin's Great American Adventure'', based on the comic ''[[Tintin in America]]'' (1976<U+2013>1977) and ''Tintin and the Black Island'', based on ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1980<U+2013>81); this second play later toured.{{refn|group=nb|Geoffrey Case (adapted), Tony Wredden (directed): ''Tintin's Great American Adventure'', Arts Theatre, London, 18 December 1976 to 20 February 1977, Unicorn Theatre Company.

=== Video games ===
Tintin began appearing in [[video game]]s when [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA]], a French game company, released the [[side scroller]] ''[[Tintin on the Moon]]'' in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=MobyGames.com|1y=1989|2a1=Sinclair Infoseek|2y=1989}}
The same company released a [[platform game|platformer]] video game titled ''[[Tintin in Tibet (video game)|Tintin in Tibet]]'' in 1995 for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.{{sfn|MobyGames.com|1995}}
Another platformer from Infogrames titled ''[[Prisoners of the Sun (video game)|Prisoners of the Sun]]'' was released the following year for the Super Nintendo, PC, and GameBoy Color.{{sfn|MobyGames.com|1996}}
As computer graphics technology improved, video game experiences improved. In 2001, Tintin became 3D in a game called ''[[Tintin: Destination Adventure]]'', released by Infogrames for the PC and PlayStation.{{sfn|MobyGames.com|2001}}
Then in 2011, a [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game called ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (video game)|The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', a tie-in to the 2011 movie, was released by [[Ubisoft]] in October 2011.{{sfn|MobyGames.com|2011}}

[[File:Tintin Shop.jpg|thumb|right|The Tintin Shop in [[Covent Garden]]{{sfn|Pignal|2010}}]]

=== Memorabilia and merchandise ===
Images from the series have long been [[license]]d for use on [[merchandise]], the success of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine helping to create a market for such items.  Tintin's image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants.{{sfn|Conrad|2004}}  There are countless separate items related to the character available, with some becoming [[collectible|collectors' items]] in their own right.{{sfn|Jouret|1991|p=49}}

The Herg<U+00E9> Foundation has maintained control of the licenses, through [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation#Moulinsart|Moulinsart]], the commercial wing of the foundation.  Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: "We have to be very protective of the property.  We don't take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective ... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use."{{sfn|DITT|2002}}  However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as "trivialising the work of Herg<U+00E9> by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising" in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.{{sfn|Bright|1999}}

Tintin [[memorabilia]] and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable.  The first shop was launched in 1984 in [[Covent Garden]], London.{{sfn|Pignal|2010}}  Tintin shops have also opened in both [[Bruges]] and Brussels in Belgium, and in [[Montpellier]], France.  
The British bookstore chain, [[Ottakar's]], founded in 1987, was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'', and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise until their takeover by [[Waterstone's]] in 2006.{{sfn|Irish Times 9 January|1999}}

Tintin's image has been used on [[postage stamp]]s on numerous occasions.  
The first ''Tintin'' postage stamp was an eight-franc stamp issued by [[Bpost|Belgian Post]] for the 50th anniversary of the publication of Tintin's first adventure on Sept. 29, 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps.{{sfnm|1a1=PostBeeld|1y=2010|2a1=Ahl|2y=2011|3a1=TintinMilou.free.fr|3y=2011|4a1=Kenneally|4y=1991}}  
In 1999, a nine-stamp block celebrating ten years of the [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] was issued, with the center stamp a photo of Tintin's famous moon rocket that dominates the Comic Strip Center's entry hall.{{sfnm|1a1=Ahl|1y=2011|2a1=TintinMilou.free.fr|2y=2011}}  
To mark the end of the Belgian Franc and to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', two more stamps were issued by Belgian Post on 31 December 2001: Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center.  The stamps were jointly issued in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ahl|1y=2011|2a1=TintinMilou.free.fr|2y=2011}}  
In 2004, Belgian Post celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'', and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the moon landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the ''Explorers on the Moon'' adventure.{{sfnm|1a1=White|1y=2007|2a1=Ahl|2y=2011|3a1=TintinMilou.free.fr|3y=2011}}

Besides stamps, Tintin has also been [[Commemorative coins of Belgium|commemorated by coin]] several times.  
In 1995, the {{lang|fr|[[Monnaie de Paris]]}} (Paris Mint) issued a set of twelve gold [[medallion]]s, available in a limited edition of 5000.{{sfnm|1a1=Chard|1y=1995|2a1=OmniCoin|2y=2009}}

Also issued were a 10-euro (gold) featuring Tintin with a 20-euro (silver) and a 50-euro (gold) featuring Tintin and Snowy.{{sfnm|1a1=Numista|1y=2006|2a1=Coin Database|2y=2006}}  Belgium then issued its 20-euro (silver) Herg<U+00E9>/Tintin coin in 2007, on Herg<U+00E9>'s centenary.{{sfnm|1a1=Coin Talk|1y=2007|2a1=NumisCollect|2y=2007}}

=== Parody and pastiche ===
{{Main|List of Tintin parodies and pastiches}}

[[File:Frame from Breaking Free.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A frame from ''Breaking Free'', a [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] comic that parodies the ''Adventures of Tintin''{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}]]

During Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime, [[parody|parodies]] were produced of the ''Adventures of Tintin'', with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper ''La Patrie'' after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944.  Entitled ''{{lang|fr|Tintin au pays de nazis}}'' ("''Tintin in the Land of the Nazis''"), the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Herg<U+00E9> for working for a Nazi-run newspaper during the occupation.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=2007|1pp=186<U+2013>187|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2p=168}}

Following Herg<U+00E9>'s death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and [[pastiche]]s of the ''Adventures of Tintin'' were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres.{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}  Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: those that are pornographic, those that are political, and those that are artistic.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=2007|1p=186|2a1=BBC News 14 February|2y=2001}}  In a number of cases, the actual name "Tintin" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books.{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}

* From McCarthy's first group, some of the parodies are pornographic in content, such as 1976's ''Tintin en Suisse'' ("Tintin in Switzerland") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work ''La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin'' ("Tintin's Sex Life"), featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts.{{sfnm|1a1=Coxhead|1y=2007|2a1=McCarthy|2y=2007|2p=186|3a1=Perrotte|3a2=Van Gong|3y=2006}}  Another such example was ''[[Tintin in Thailand]]'', in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a [[sex holiday]].  The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.{{sfn|BBC News 14 February|2001}}

* Other parodies have been produced for political reasons, for instance ''Tintin in Iraq'' lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century, with Herg<U+00E9>'s character General Alcazar representing President of the United States [[George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}  Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free|Breaking Free]]'' (1989) is a [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] comic set in Britain during the 1980s, with Tintin and his uncle (modelled after Captain Haddock) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]].  When first published in Britain, it caused an outrage in the mainstream press, with one paper issuing the headline that "Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob!"{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}

* Other comic creators have chosen to create artistic stories that are more like [[fan fiction]] than parody.  The Swiss artist Exem created the irreverent comic adventures of Zinzin, what [[The Guardian]] calls "the most beautifully produced of the pastiches."{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}  Similarly, Canadian cartoonist [[Yves Rodier]] has produced a number of Tintin works, none of which have been authorised by the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation, including a 1986 "completion" of the unfinished ''Tintin and Alph-art'', which he drew in Herg<U+00E9>'s {{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}} style.{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}

The response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community.  Many Tintinologists despise them, seeing them as an affront to Herg<U+00E9>'s work.{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}  This being the view taken by Nick Rodwell of the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]], who declared that "None of these copyists count as true fans of Herg<U+00E9>.  If they were, they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin's adventures."{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}  Where possible, the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items.  Other Tintinologists have however taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Herg<U+00E9>, and collecting them has become a "niche specialty".{{sfn|Coxhead|2007}}

The exhibition, which ran from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007, featured some 300 of Herg<U+00E9>'s boards and original drawings, including all 124 original plates of ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Le Figaro 20 December|1y=2006|2a1=Der Spiegel 20 December|2y=2006|3a1=Chiha|3y=2007|4a1=Dubois|4y=2006|5a1=Radio T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vision Suisse 28 June|5y=2010|6a1=CentrePompidou.fr|6y=2006|7a1=Wainman|7y=2007}}
Laurent le Bon, organizer of the exhibit said, "It was important for the Centre to show the work of Herg<U+00E9> next to that of Matisse or Picasso."{{sfn|designboom|2006}}  Tintinologist Michael Farr said, "Herg<U+00E9> has long been seen as a father figure in the comics world.

Herg<U+00E9> is recognised as one of the leading cartoonists of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Radio T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vision Suisse 28 June|2010}}  Most notably, Herg<U+00E9>'s {{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}} style has been influential to creators of other [[Franco-Belgian comics]].  Contributors to ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine have employed {{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}}, and later artists [[Jacques Tardi]], [[Yves Chaland]], [[Jason Little (cartoonist)|Jason Little]], [[Phil Elliott]], [[Martin Handford]], [[Geof Darrow]], Eric Heuvel, [[Garen Ewing]], [[Joost Swarte]], and others have produced works using it.{{sfn|Armitstead|Sprenger|2011}}

In the wider art world, both [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] have claimed Herg<U+00E9> as one of their most important influences.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=280}}  Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from ''Tintin'' comics, whilst Warhol used {{lang|fr|ligne claire}} and even made a series of paintings with Herg<U+00E9> as the subject.  Warhol, who admires Tintin's "great political and satirical dimensions",{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=280}} said, "Herg<U+00E9> has influenced my work in the same way as [[Walt Disney]].  For me, Herg<U+00E9> was more than a comic strip artist".{{sfn|BBC News10 January|1999}}

Herg<U+00E9> has been lauded as "creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century's tortured history" through his work on Tintin,{{sfn|PBS July|2006}} whilst Maurice Horn's ''World Encyclopedia of Comics'' declares him to have "spear-headed the post-World War II renaissance of European comic art".{{sfn|Beaty|1995}}  French philosopher [[Michel Serres]] noted that the twenty-three completed Tintin albums constituted a "''{{lang|fr|chef-d'oeuvre}}''" ("masterpiece") to which "the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness".{{sfn|Adair|1993}}

In 1966, [[Charles de Gaulle]] said, "In the end, you know, my only international rival is Tintin!  We are the small ones, who do not let themselves be had by the great ones."{{refn|group=nb|{{lang-fr|"''Au fond, vous savez, mon seul rival international c'est Tintin!  Nous sommes les petits qui ne se laissent pas avoir par les grands.''"|links=no}} Spoken by Charles de Gaulle, according to his Minister for Cultural Affairs [[Andr<U+00E9> Malraux]].  De Gaulle had just [[NATO#French withdrawal|banned all NATO aircraft bases from France]]; "the great ones" referred to USA and USSR.  De Gaulle then added, "Only nobody notices the likeness because I am so tall."{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-de-Gaulle.org|1y=1958|2a1=The New York Times 5 March|2y=1983|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=9}} }}{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-de-Gaulle.org|1y=1958|2a1=The New York Times 5 March|2y=1983|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=9}}
