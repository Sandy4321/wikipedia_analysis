'''Shell jewelry''' is [[jewelry]] which is primarily made from [[seashell]]s, the shells of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s. Shell jewelry is a type of [[shellcraft]]. One very common form of shell jewelry is [[necklace]]s that are composed of large numbers of [[bead]]s where each individual bead is the whole (but drilled) [[Gastropod shell|shell]] of a small [[sea snail]]. Numerous other varieties of shell jewelry are made, including [[bracelet]]s and [[earring]]s. Occasionally shell jewelry is made from the shells of [[land snail]]s [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1627/2907.full], or the shells of freshwater mollusks.

Shell jewelry also uses the shells of clams ([[bivalves]]) and sometimes tusk shells ([[scaphopod]]s). Not all shell jewelry is made from whole shells; some kinds are made from parts of shells.

In recent times, inexpensive shell jewelry is often for sale in tropical beach destinations, where it is offered to tourists as informal wear or as a [[souvenir]]. However, shell jewelry has a very ancient past and is of very considerable [[archeological]] importance.

In 2006 in the journal ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' researchers claimed that in the [[Levant]] and [[North Africa]] they had found shells that appear to have been worn as beads 100,000 years ago.[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5781/1731.short]
