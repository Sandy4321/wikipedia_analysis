The '''''Question Time'' George Galloway in Finchley controversy''' relates to an edition of the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' broadcast on 5 February 2015 in which the [[Respect Party|Respect]] member of parliament [[George Galloway]] was invited to participate. Hosted by [[David Dimbleby]] as usual, the edition was recorded earlier in the evening in Finchley, North London, an area which has the largest Jewish minority in the UK.<ref name="Dysch060215">Marcus Dysch [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129593/george-galloway-challenged-hostile-audience-finchley-question-time "George Galloway challenged by hostile audience at Finchley Question Time"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 6 February 2015</ref>

Although Galloway has appeared on ''Question Time'' on many occasions, this invitation was criticised ahead of the broadcast because of Galloway's outspoken attitude towards Israel.<ref>Alex Klineberg [http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/george-galloway-and-the-jews-what-could-go-wrong/ "George Galloway And The Jews (What Could Go Wrong?)"], ''The Times of Israel'' (blog), 28 February 2015</ref>

==Announcement==
News of Galloway's invitation emerged in late January, more than a week before the broadcast. The chief executive of the [[Jewish Leadership Council]] thought the BBC's invitation was "at best insensitive and at worst an unnecessary provocative stunt, which is unbecoming of the UK's national broadcaster."<ref name="Dysch">Marcus Dysch and Sandy Rashty [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129074/outrage-over-question-time-slot-george-galloway "Outrage over 'Question Time' slot for George Galloway"], ''The Jewish Chronuicle'', 29 January 2015</ref> The chief executive of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] thought an "inflammatory and cynical decision" had been made, but also said "we look forward to" people in the constituency "having the opportunity to call George Galloway to account for his scandalous record of provocation and division."<ref name="Rashty">Sandy Rashty [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129151/galloway-question-time-appearance-chance-call-mp-account-says-board "Galloway Question Time appearance is chance to call MP to account, says Board"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 29 January 2015</ref> [[Mike Freer]], the Conservative member of parliament for [[Finchley and Golders Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley and Golders Green]], also thought the BBC had made a decision which lacked sensitivity.<ref name="Dysch"/>

At the end of January, the BBC defended Galloway's right to speak on this edition on freedom of speech grounds and because he is an MP.<ref>'Monkey' [http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/jan/27/george-galloways-question-time-slot-lacks-sensitivity-bbc-told "George Galloway's Question Time slot 'lacks sensitivity', BBC told"], ''The Guardian'', 27 January 2015</ref><ref>Lamiat Sabin [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/jewish-groups-protest-against-george-galloway-appearance-in-finchley-for-bbcs-question-time-10021775.html "Jewish groups protest against George Galloway appearance in Finchley for BBC's Question Time"], ''The Independent'', 3 February 2015</ref> On Twitter, two days prior to the programme, Galloway accused "Zionist extremists" of attempting to "wreck" his participation.<ref>Jack Sommers [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/02/03/question-time-george-galloway-finchley_n_6602982.html "George Galloway's 'Cynical' Question Time Invite Triggers Backlash From Jewish Groups"], ''The Huffington Post'', 3 February 2015</ref>

==Broadcast==
Earlier in the day of the programme's recording and transmission, a new study by the [[Community Security Trust]], a British charity which monitors [[antisemitism]], had issued a study reported 1,168  antisemitic incidents during 2014, an increase over the previous year and the highest number ever recorded in the UK.<ref name="Guardian060215">[http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/06/george-galloway-accuses-bbc-over-question-time-set-up "George Galloway accuses BBC over Question Time 'set-up'"], ''The Guardian'', 6 February 2015</ref>

The last question asked by an audience member was: "Why is antisemitism rising in the UK and do you think a certain member of the panel bear[s] some responsibility for this?" In this part of the programme Galloway was repeated heckled, and Dimbleby asked for calm several times.<ref name="Moodley">Kiran Moodley [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/george-galloway-heckled-on-question-time-for-antiisrael-stance-you-can-be-the-lions-ill-be-daniel-10027844.html "George Galloway heckled during Question Time over his anti-Israel stance: 'You can be the lions, I'll be Daniel'"], ''The Independent'', 6 February 2015</ref>

[[Jonathan Freedland]], an executive editor of ''[[The Guardian]]'', "People like George Galloway need to exercise great responsibility in this area because it<U+2019>s incendiary<U+2026> and can lead to hate,"<ref>Paul Vale [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/02/05/george-galloway-repeatedly-attacked-during-fractious-question-time_n_6626920.html "George Galloway Heckled During Fractious Question Time Debate On Rising Anti-Semitic Tide"], ''The Huffington Post'', 6 February 2015</ref> Galloway said: "I can<U+2019>t tell you how deeply I resent this part of the programme. Antisemitism is a foul form of racism that in the 1930s led to the Holocaust." He insisted that he would have fought fascism if he had been around at the time.<ref name="Dysch060215"/>

Freedland was criticised by Galloway for referring to the [[2014 Israel<U+2013>Gaza conflict]] as "a resumption of violence", whereas "other people call it mass murder by Israel" in which "2,136 Palestinians locked up in a prison camp called Gaza" had died.<ref name="Moodley"/> Galloway said that attacks on Muslims in the UK were more numerous and called for unity on opposing antisemitism and Islamophobia.<ref name="Dysch060215"/> Freedland, who had drawn a connection between the war and the increase in antisemitism in the UK, was not asked to return to the discussion by Dimbleby.<ref name="Guardian060215"/>

The other panellists on the programme were the secretary of state for education [[Nicky Morgan (politician)|Nicky Morgan]], shadow education spokesman [[Tristram Hunt]] and journalist [[Cristina Odone]].<ref name="Moodley"/>

==Aftermath==
After the broadcast, Galloway asserted that he had been "set up" by the BBC, because the second part of the question was delivered without the consent of the production team, but left in; the programme, as usual, was pre-recorded. He asserted that Dimbleby had apologised for the question privately.<ref name="Guardian060215"/> <ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/galloway-bbc-set-me-up-with-anti-semite-question-1-3682901 "Galloway: BBC set me up with anti-semite question"], ''The Scotsman'', 6 February 2015</ref>The questioner, student Gabriel Rosen, later said the claim about his unauthorised addition was true.<ref>Marcus Dysch [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129613/george-galloway-questioner-reveals-what-went-question-time-studio "George Galloway questioner reveals what went on in Question Time studio"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 6 February 2015</ref>

In Galloway's opinion, Freedland had taken the role of "the prosecutor-in-chief, he lit the touch paper and then smugly retired."<ref name="Guardian060215"/> Freedland expressed disappointment at the behaviour of the audience. Responding to Galloway's accusation, he said: "I simply pointed out that he has in the past inflamed an already tense issue by making wild, unfounded accusations <U+2013> a point he did not address."<ref name="Guardian060215"/> Galloway wrote an extended post on his blog in which he asserted that the audience selection was "laughably biased" and that "not a single visibly Muslim person made it to the audience."<ref>Sara C.

Roslyn Pine, of the North Salford Synagogue, condemned the behaviour of the audience because it reduced the time available "to make the points which would have shown Galloway for what he is".<ref>Roslyn Pine [http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/opinion-jewish-hotheads-lost-argument-easily-won/ "Opinion: Jewish hotheads lost an argument that could so easily have been won"], ''Jewish News Online'', 10 February 2015</ref> [[Alex Brummer]], wrote in ''The Jewish Chronicle'': "We must all combat those who single out Israel as a pariah state rather than recognising its achievements. But shouting down the messengers, rather than engaging in serious dialogue, doesn<U+2019>t make much sense."<ref>Alex Brummer [http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/129909/question-time-fallout-were-meant-debate-not-hate "Question Time fallout: we're meant to debate, not hate"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 12 February 2015</ref>
