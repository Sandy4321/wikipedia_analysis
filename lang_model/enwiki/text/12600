'''Colab''' is the commonly used abbreviation of the [[New York City]] artists' group '''Collaborative Projects''', which was formed after a series of open meetings between artists of various disciplines.<ref>David Little, ''Colab Takes a Piece, History Takes It Back: Collectivity and New York Alternative Spaces'', ''Art Journal'' Vol.66, No. 1, Spring 2007, College Art Association, New York, pp. 60-74.</ref> Colab came together as a collective in 1977, and initially received an NEA Workshop Grant through Center for New Art Activities, Inc., a small not-for-profit formed in 1974. The grant was divided equally among the artist members in groups of three.

In 1978, Collaborative Projects was incorporated as a not-for-profit and later received its tax-exempt status from the IRS, so that it could apply for grants from the NEA and other sources independently.<ref>[[Julie Ault]]. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' University of Minnesota Press, 2002: p.217.</ref> Colab was active for about 10 years and became distinguished by the raw energy of its members and sometimes politically engaged open membership. By raising its own sources of funding, Colab was in control of its own exhibitions and cable TV shows, and bypassed the bigger, more established [[Alternative exhibition space|alternative spaces]]

From January 1979, different artist members put on several notable one-off group shows in their own studios or other temporary sites, such as ''The Manifesto Show'' (5 [[Bleecker Street]] 1979), ''[[The Real Estate Show]]'' ([[Delancey Street]], Jan. 1980), and especially ''The Times Square Show'' (201 W 41st, Summer 1980), a large open exhibition near the center of New York's entertainment (and pornography) district ([[Times Square]]) put on with Bronx-based [[Fashion Moda]]. Seed money from the first Colab workshop grant led to the creation of [[New Cinema]], a screening room on St. Mark's Place for narrative Super 8 films transferred to video and projected on an Advent screen; the publication of X Motion Picture Magazine(1979);<ref>Marc Masters, (2007) ''[[No Wave]]'', Black Dog Publishing, London, p. 141</ref> support and inspiration for the [[ABC No Rio|ABC No Rio cultural center]] (1980-82 (ongoing); Potato Wolf artists' TV series on Manhattan Cable (1978<U+2013>1984), support of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] (1984), and MWF Video Club (established in 1986).<ref>[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974<U+2013>1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006</ref> Members of the original group are presently highly active making art, and the membership has shifted and evolved. ABC No Rio was recently awarded a $1.6 million capital construction grant from the City of New York. ''

"We [Collaborative Projects] are functioning as a group of artists with complementary resources and skills providing a solid ground for [[collaborative]] work directed to the needs of the community-at-large. Specifically we are involved in programs facilitating development, production, and distribution of collaborative works. These works are realized in various [[Media (arts)|media]] including [[film]] and [[video]] for distribution and cable-cast, and live cable TV broadcasts, as well as other more conventional art media such as graphics and printed materials."<ref>''The Red Book'', 1978 (NEA application document authored by Coleen Fitzgibbon, Andrea Callard and Ulli Rimkus) Andrea Callard Papers, ''The Downtown Collection'', Fales Library, [[NYU]]</ref>

"This statement (the one above) defines three fundamental aspects of Colab - members' desire to create and distribute "collaborative work" under the umbrella of an artist-run organization, their focus on new media versus traditional art objects and their openness to a range of aesthetic styles that would meet the "needs of the community-at-large." This last point was critical to the group's identity and served as the foundation of a workshop-oriented administration that encouraged experimentation in many different areas, including but not limited to TV production, video editing, film, and [[performance art]]. With various workshops operating simultaneously and the participants' ability to draw on like-minded members as partners, Colab could produce many projects without the burden of an institutional identity. Typically, individual members worked together on more than one project in small subgroups that changed and over lapped from one project to the next."<ref>[http://www.tomotterness.net/pdf/news_artjournal_colabdavidlittle_2007.pdf] David Little, Artjounal pdf file</ref>

In 1980, artists emulating 1970s Puerto Rican activists seized a building on New York's [[Lower East Side]] and opened it as a collectively run cultural center. [[ABC No Rio]] was passed on to successive managements until today it is an [[anarchist]] cultural center run by a collective with close ties to the publishing group [[Autonomedia]]."<ref>Alan W. Moore, ''Artists' Collectives: Focus on New York, 1975-2000'' in ''Collectivism After Modernism: The Art of Social Imagination after 1945'', Blake Stimson & Gregory Sholette, (eds) University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 2007, pp. 193-221</ref>

"In the bohemia of downtown [[Manhattan]], the band - and crew - based practices of [[art rock]] and [[super-8 film]] making thrived. The first artists' group to achieve prominence in New York was Colab (Collaborative Projects), which produced a show in [[Times Square]] in 1980. This exhibition was a groundswell of popularly accessible socially themed artworks held in an empty building that has housed an erotic [[massage parlor]]. Critics called it "[[punk art]]" -- "three cord art anyone can play." The South Bronx art space [[Fashion Moda]].  participated in the '''Times Square Show''', bringing in some of the new generation of [[graffiti art]]ists who had been exhibiting in the [[Bronx]] as part of the [[hip-hop]] culture of writers, [[rapper]]s, and [[break dance]]rs.  A forty-member democratically run membership group; Colab inspired other artists to form groups and mount huge shows in [[Brooklyn]] lofts, not to mention collaboration with the [[Washington Project for the Arts]], for the [[Ritz Hotel Project, Washington, D.C.|Ritz Hotel Project]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1983.

==Retrospective exhibitions==
In 2008, a small partial retrospective exhibition called "Colab Redux" was held at Brooke Alexander Gallery.<ref>[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-installation.htm Colab Redux installation]</ref><ref>[http://www.baeditions.com/installation-views/colab-redux/colab-redux-press-release.htm Colab Redux PR]</ref>

In 2011, Printed Matter, Inc. presented an exhibition entitled "A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)". This overarching survey presented a wide range of materials and artworks from various Colab activities from the late 1970<U+2019>s through the mid 1980<U+2019>s, including screenings of film and video works, and cable broadcasts.<ref>[http://printedmatter.org/news/news.cfm?article_id=857 A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)]</ref>

In 2012, The [[Hunter College]] Art Galleries presented "Times Square Show Revisited", an in-depth look at the original "Times Square Show" (1980). "Times Square Show Revisited" was the first focused assessment of the landmark exhibition organized by the artist group Collaborative Projects, Inc.<ref>[http://www.timessquareshowrevisited.com/press.html Times Square Show Revisited]</ref> Bobby G's audio piece "Times Sq. Show Audio" (0:38) appears on [[Just Another Asshole]], a compilation anthology LP that was released in 1981 and reissued in 1995 on Atavistic Records.

In 2013, an exhibition workshop entitled "XFR STN" (Transfer Station) was held at the [[New Museum]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/arts/design/xfr-stn-offers-a-digital-update-at-the-new-museum.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=1& Preserving That Great Performance - XFR STN Offers a Digital Update at the New Museum - article in the New York Times]</ref> The opening night featured "Moving Image Artists' Distribution Then & Now" an ersatz assembly of participants in the MWF video club, introduced by [[Andrea Callard]], Michael Carter, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Nick Zedd]] and [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]]. Alan W. Moore created MWF Club in 1986 as a distribution company for Potato Wolf and All Color News COLAB television programs that aired on public access TV. MWF Club expanded to include programs from various other groups such as Communications Update, Downtown TV, [[Glenn O'Brien]]'s TV Party, [[New Cinema]], [[Cinema of Transgression]], Naked Eye Cinema and numerous artists and filmmakers.<ref>[http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/xfr-stn XFR STN at the New Museum]</ref> Also in 2013 Tom Warren's Photo Portfolio of "Colab Artists Portraits (1981-1984)" were featured at Gallery 98<ref>[http://gallery.98bowery.com/tom-warren-portfolio-of-portraits-of-colab-artists-10-photographs-1981-1984/] Tom Warren, Photo Portfolio COLAB Artists Portraits, 1981-1984</ref> and [[The Film-Makers' Cooperative]] presented a mini [[video]] [[retrospective]] entitled "Colab TV Video Excerpts" on November 15th at [[Soho House (club)|Soho House]] in New York City with discussion with [[Tom Otterness]].
