'''Mark Randall Meadows''' is a businessman and politician currently running for Congress in [[North Carolina's 11th congressional district]].

==2012 congressional campaign==
In late 2011, Meadows announced he was running for Congress in North Carolina's 11th congressional district, being vacated by [[Heath Shuler]]. He won the Republican primary runoff in July 2012,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mark Meadows sweeps 11th congressional GOP run-off|url=http://www.maconnews.com/news/state--region/3317-mark-meadows-sweeps-11th-congressional-gop-run-off|accessdate=31 August 2012|newspaper=The Macon County News|date=19 July 2012|author=Parker, Brittney}}</ref> and faces Democrat Hayden Rogers in November. However, the 11th district was made much more Republican following redistricting, so Meadows is heavily favored in the general election.

Meadows spoke at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] in Tampa, Florida on August 28, 2012.<ref>http://www.hendersonvillelightning.com/blog/2012/uncategorized/meadows-back-on-with-tuesday-slot-at-convention/</ref>
