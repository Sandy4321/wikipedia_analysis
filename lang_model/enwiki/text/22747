'''Nicolas Ladany''' (also ''Nicolau Ladanyi,'' born 7 April 1889<ref>Di<U+00E1>rio Oficial da Uni<U+00E3>o, 1940-07-31, p. 5:  "''A Nicolau Ladanyi, natural da Hungria, nascido, a 7 de abril de 1889, filho de Martin Ladanyi e de Mitria Zoldi, casado, residente nesta Capital.''" (naturalisation notices).</ref>) was a Hungarian association football coach. Most notable are his two [[Campeonato Carioca|Championships of Rio de Janeiro]] with [[Botafogo FC]] in 1931 and 1932. He later became an identity of the show business of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

== Career ==

Capit<U+00E3>o Ladany, Captain Ladany, as he was very frequently referred to, was a footballer and served in the Austria armed forces. After [[World War I]] he emigrated to the United States of America where he undertook specialised studies in sports training and became a naturalised citizen in order to run a gymnasium. Reportedly, he was for an extended period director of the ''Aeskulap Health Institute'' of New York.<ref Name=DdN19311228>Di<U+00E1>rio da No<U+00ED>te (RJ): ''"Meia hora de palestra com o capit<U+00E3>o Nickolas Ladany, technico de Botafogo"'', 28 December 1931, p. 6.</ref>

In 1930 he moved to Brazil where he was employed by the legendary president of Botafogo FC, of [[Rio de Janeiro]], later known as [[Botafogo FR]], Paulo Azeredo as  "technical director."<ref>The common Portuguese term "t<U+00E9>cnico" for a football coach would derive from "director technico."</ref> His employment occurred in the midst of the 1930 season of the [[Campeonato Carioca|Championship of Rio de Janeiro]] and at that time the sports director at the club was the medical doctor [[Victor Guisard]] and the coaching was in the hands of the Englishman [[Charlie Williams (footballer)|Charles Williams]], the former Manchester City goalkeeper. Ladany's brief included deploying a [[psychoanalysis]] based training programme, which Williams disagreed with. Williams resigned but was retained as assistant coach, a position he held  alongside star-player [[Nilo Murtinho Braga|Nilo]].<ref>S<U+00E9>rgio Augusto: ''Botafogo: entre o c<U+00E9>u e o inferno.'' Ediouro Publica<U+00E7><U+00F5>es, 2004.</ref><ref>Roberto Assaf, Cl<U+00F3>vis Martins: ''Campeonato Carioca: 96 anos de hist<U+00F3>ria, 1902-1997'', Irradia<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Cultural, 1997, p. 156, 191.</ref>

Under the stewardship of Ladany Botafogo went on to win the championship by the end of the year, the up to then only fourth title of Botafogo. After finishing only fourth in 1931 Botafogo was champion once more in 1932, with only one defeat and two draws in 22 matches. Stars of Botafogo in that era were players like [[Carvalho Leite]], the team's top-scorer [[Nilo Murtinho Braga|Nilo]] and [[Martim Silveira]]. Botafogo would in this period, which describes the "golden era" of the club, also the three championships from 1933 to 1935. However, the latter successes occurred in a period when there were two simultaneous championships in Rio, primarily because the clubs were divided by there attitude towards professionalisation. Ladany himself was an opponent of professionalism, as he thought, Rio could only carry three or four professional teams, and top teams like his Botafogo, had only about four players who would be suitable as professionals.<ref Name=DdN19311228 /> Similar success for Botafogo would only recur in the late 1950s and early 1960s, coinciding with the third presidency of Azeredo, when the side fronted by [[Garrincha]], [[Amarildo]] and [[M<U+00E1>rio Zagallo]] would win three championships.

By mid 1933, during the course of the season, Ladany switched to crosstown rivals [[America FC (RJ)|America FC]] of the new dissident competition of the [[Liga Carioca de Football]], which organised in that year the first professional season in Rio. At Botafogo Ladany was replaced by Victor Guisard. America finished only fifth out of six teams in its league. Until July 1933 he also served in the Football Commission of [[Associa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Metropolitana de Esportes Athleticos|AMEA]], the governing body of Rio's football since 1924, and acted, at least on occasions, as coach of its selective team.<ref>A Noite (RJ): "''O presidente da Amea desligou diversos representantes de commiss<U+00F5>es''", 4 July 1933, p. 11</ref>

After his brief time with America, which did not last beyond early February 1934 he went back to the USA for a brief period, where he reported, that he was envolved with the training of the USA national team in preparation for the 1934 World Cup. He also reported of the difficulties assembling a strong side, because most players would be from abroad, from countries like Scotland and Spain. He mentioned, on his return in May 1934, that stars there would make in "average 40.000 dollars per year."<ref>Di<U+00E1>rio da Noite (RJ): ''"O Am<U+00E9>rica pretende apresentar um grande team em 1934"'', 2 February 1934, p. 6.</ref><ref>Di<U+00E1>rio da Noite (RJ): ''"A bordo do <U+00AB>Southern Cross<U+00BB> regressou o capit<U+00E3>o Ladany"'', 25 May 1934, p. 7.</ref>

From October 1934 he was hired as instructor at ''Liga de Sports da Marinha'', the sports club of the navy. Under Ladany's stewardship their football team took take part in qualifying matches for the [[Campeonato dos Campe<U+00F5>es]] of 1936, organised by the [[Federa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Brasileira de Futebol]].<ref>Liga de Sports da Marinha was founded in 1915 by navy officers. After several name changes it has been known since 1975 as ''Comiss<U+00E3>o de Desportos da Marinha''. S. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20091207230017/http://www.cadetu.com.br/cdm.mar.mil.br Comiss<U+00E3>o de Desportos da Marinha, Rio de Janeiro]'' via [[Internet Archive]].</ref><ref>A Noite (RJ): ''O scratch da Marinha que jogar<U+00E1> em Campos'', 6 January 1937.</ref>

In 1938 he became associated with the Casino in [[Urca, Rio de Janeiro|Urca]], in those days known through stars like [[Carmen Miranda]], where he worked for the publicity department.<ref>O Imparcial (RJ): ''Anniversarios'', 27 May 1938, p. 12.</ref> Later he became artistic director there. In May 1939 he was reportedly once more coaching Botafogo, which later on that year would be taken on by the great [[Izidor K<U+00FC>rschner]].<ref>O Imparcial: "''A nova direc<U+00E7><U+00E3>o technica do Botafogo F.C. em actividade''", 10 May 1939, p. 8.</ref> In the early 1940s he still served the Liga de Sports of the navy. Until the late 1950s or even into the 1960s Ladany, then called a person "closely associated with the show business of Rio in the era of the casinos," was "social director" (''director social'') of the famous [[Hotel Quitandinha]] in [[Petr<U+00F3>polis]] north of Rio, which in that era hosted international stars like [[Jayne Mansfield]].<ref>Correio da Manha (RJ): "''Gatos pardos''", 12 February 1959, p. 15.</ref>

Nicolau Ladany's daughter, Gl<U+00F3>ria Ladany, started about 1955 as a dancer in the large variety shows of Carlos Machado, and became inside a few years an actress, over the next couple of decades frequently seen in the theatres of Rio de Janeiro. From 1959 forward she also starred in film and television and became a respected, versatile [[Voice acting|voice actor]], dubbing many famous stars.<ref>[[<U+00DA>ltima Hora (Brazil)|<U+00DA>ltima Hora]] (RJ), "Pai da vedetinha Gl<U+00F3>ria Ladany", 14 November 1956, p. 13.</ref><ref>{{IMDb name|id=0480433|name=Gl<U+00F3>ria Ladany}}</ref><ref>''[http://www.casadadublagem.besaba.com/glorialadany.html Dubladores: Gloria Ladany]'', Casa da Dublagem.</ref>
