'''Juwan Antonio Howard''' (born February 7, 1973) is an American professional basketball player who plays for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The Heat are Howard's eighth NBA team. A one-time [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] and one-time [[All-NBA]] [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], he began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the [[1994 NBA Draft]] by the [[Washington Bullets]]. Before he was drafted, he starred as an [[All-American]] on the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]]. At Michigan he was part of the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] in [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]]. Howard won his first NBA championship with Miami in the [[2012 NBA Finals]].

Howard was an All-American [[center (basketball)|center]] and an [[honors student]] at [[Chicago Vocational Career Academy]]. Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included [[Chris Webber]], [[Jalen Rose]], [[Jimmy King]] and [[Ray Jackson]], served as regular [[starting lineup|starters]] during their freshman and sophomore years for the [[1991<U+2013>92 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1991<U+2013>92]] and [[1992<U+2013>93 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1992<U+2013>93 Wolverines]]. Howard is the last member of the Fab Five who remains active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]], which involved booster payments to players to [[Money laundering|launder money]] from illegal gambling, Howard's [[1994 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|1993<U+2013>94 All-American]] season continues to be recognized. 

Howard has played six-and-a-half seasons (1994<U+2013>2001) for the Bullets franchise (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004<U+2013>2007) for the [[Houston Rockets]], two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie year with the Bullets, he became the first player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an [[NBA All-Rookie Team|All-Rookie]] player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, he became the first NBA player to sign a $100&nbsp;million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make [[salary cap]] room. He was most recently a regular starter during the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season]]. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career [[2011 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.

==Early life==
Howard's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the daughter of [[sharecropper]]s from [[Belzoni, Mississippi]]. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant. For Howard's first week of life, his high school junior mother kept him in a drawer at Jannie Mae's house.<ref name=Albom4>{{cite book|author=Albom|page=4|chapter=}}</ref> Helena, who was 17 years old, did not want to be restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him.<ref name=Hehg/> His biological father, Leroy Watson, Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard.<ref name=GmiH>{{cite news|title=Grandma's memory inspires Howard |date=April 5, 1992|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=5, sports section|author=Mariotti, Jay}}</ref>  Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him,<ref name=Albom4/> along with two cousins.<ref name=CU/> Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/22/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-bullets-may-now-be-loaded.html|title=Sports of The Times; The Bullets May Now Be Loaded|accessdate=May 21, 2010|date=November 22, 1994|author=Berkow, Ira|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> his grandmother was the primary influence in his life.<ref name=Albom4/> He moved with her to several low-income [[South Side, Chicago|Chicago South Side]] projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up.<ref name=Albom4/> One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago.<ref name=Hehg>{{cite news|title=Howard's effort honors grandma|date=April 7, 1992|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Milbert, Neil |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-07/sports/9202010228_1_juwan-howard-michigan-early-period|accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> As he blossomed under his grandmother's influence and discipline, he became her "pride and joy".<ref name=Hehg/>

==High school==

Howard attended [[Chicago Vocational Career Academy]], where he went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-01/sports/1995001153_1_juwan-howard-bullets-atlanta-hawks|title=Bullets' Howard practices positive thinking|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=January 1, 1995|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|author=Bembry, Jerry}}</ref> Vocational had an unheated gym and no [[locker room]]s, which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom.<ref name=CU/> Nonetheless, Howard went on to be named a 1991 All-American basketball player by ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine and won [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All American]] honors.

===Sophomore year===
At the start of his sophomore year in 1988, Howard was 15 years old and already expected to be a coveted [[blue chip (sports)|blue chip]] recruit in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top players get chance in Shootout|date=December 3, 1988|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Bell, Taylor|page=108, sports section}}</ref>  He was regarded as one of the best sophomores in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Holiday cheer from tournaments <U+2013> Simeon, King best as most others fail |date=January 2, 1989|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Bell, Taylor|page=12, sports section}}</ref> He scored 26 points in a [[Chicago Public High School League]] quarterfinal loss against a [[Deon Thomas]]-led [[Simeon Career Academy]] team.

The summer after his sophomore year, the {{convert|6|ft|8|in|m|2|adj=on}} center attended the Nike Academic Betterment and Career Development (ABCD) camp, which was held annually in {{USCity|Princeton|New Jersey}}, during the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/highschool/01/25/sonny.vaccaro/|title=End of an era: Vaccaro closes ABCD camp as he eyes hoops academy|accessdate=September 2, 2010|date=January 26, 2007|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|author=Armstrong, Kevin}}</ref> There he was matched against the {{convert|7|ft|4|in|m|2|adj=on}} [[Shawn Bradley]].

Howard also participated in the Bill Cronauer camp in {{USCity|Rensselaer|Indiana}}, which more than 100 college coaches attended.

===Junior year===
As Howard entered his junior year, some sources listed him as the best junior basketball player in Illinois,<ref name=Lpbid>{{cite news|title=Last playoff bids in doubt|date=October 28, 1989|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Bell, Taylor|page=101, sports section|quote=It's too early to make a formal commitment but Vocational's 6<U+2013>9 Juwan Howard , rated the best junior basketball prospect in the state, is expected to commit to Illinois.

After being named [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) at the prestigious Boston Shootout and acknowledged as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country.

===Senior year===
During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's grandmother treated Michigan [[head coach]] Fisher, his assistants [[Mike Boyd (basketball)|Mike Boyd]] and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a [[soul food]] dinner.<ref>{{cite book|author=Albom|page=2|chapter=}}</ref> Dutcher had the responsibility to contact Howard several times a week.<ref name=Albom3>{{cite book|author=Albom|page=3|chapter=}}</ref> Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a [[driver's license]].<ref name=Albom5>{{cite book|author=Albom|page=5|chapter=}}</ref> During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days.<ref name=Albom3/> Dutcher developed an understanding of the dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as [[Lute Olsen]], almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life,<ref name=Albom4/> and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref name=Albom5/>

After averaging 17&nbsp;points per game as a rookie and more than 22&nbsp;per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89&nbsp;million contract, but the [[Miami Heat]] outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth  $98 to $101&nbsp;million. However, according the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the [[salary cap]] by excluding performance bonuses for [[Tim Hardaway]] and [[P. J.
