'''Adolph Olson Eberhart''' ([[June 23]], [[1870]] &ndash; [[December 6]], [[1944]]) was born in [[Sweden]] and became an [[American politician]].

Born in 1870 in [[V<U+00E4>rmland]], [[Sweden]], he was a member of the [[Minnesota State Senate]] from January 1903 to January 1907. He was elected the  17th [[Lieutenant Governor]] in 1906.  He became the 17th [[Governor of Minnesota]] on [[September 21]], [[1909]], when Governor [[John Albert Johnson]] died, and served until [[January 5]], [[1915]]. Eberhart was a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]].  [[Minnesota]] elected Governors and Lt. Governors on separate ballots until 1974, so it happened occasionally that the two were of different parties.

Elected the youngest member of the state senate in 1902, the Republican Eberhart was chosen as lieutenant governor four years later in the administration of the legendary Democrat, [[John A. Johnson]]. Although his first partial term as governor resulted from Johnson's untimely death in 1909, he subsequently won the office twice on his own merits.

An efficient administrator, Eberhart was also a consummate politician, and his detractors, including many Republicans, questioned his sincerity as well as the reputation of certain close associates. To assure his re-nomination in 1912, he called a special 13-day legislative session and deflated his critics by bulldozing through such progressive reforms as rural school consolidation and primary elections. Eberhart's strategy worked; he avoided the censure of his own party and was re-nominated for a second full term in the first statewide primary.

Eberhart lost his re-nomination bid for a fourth term as governor. A second defeat in the 1916 [[U.S. Senate]] primary marked the end of his political career. After a career as a real estate and insurance executive in Chicago, he retired to a rest home where he died in [[Savage, Minnesota]].
