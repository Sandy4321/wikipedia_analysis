==Plot==
{{Plot|date=February 2008}}

The episode begins with a prologue of Aslan remembering the events of the prior two episodes.

As an army of evil imaginary creatures marches towards the castle, [[Aslan]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] inform [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] that, as a real person, he has the ability to manifest things in Imaginationland by using his imagination. Initially, Butters has trouble, manifesting his own father (who immediately grounds him before transforming into a more demonic version of himself) and a mutated Santa. 

In the real world, Kyle wakes up in [[Washington DC]] Memorial Hospital, where Cartman is undergoing preparations in anticipation of Kyle sucking his balls. Kyle somehow establishes a telepathic link with Stan, who hears a foghorn-like trumpet blaring. Stan says that "''something big is about to go down...''"

The trumpet, it turns out, heralds the arrival of the evil imaginary army. The good army, led by [[Jesus]], marvels at how greatly outnumbered they are. The two sides clash in a bloody battle, and initially, the good characters seem doomed. However, with the encouragement of the council, Butters finally manages to gain control of his imagination. With his power, Butters is able to summon appropriate backup and weaponry for the defending good guys (including resurrecting Santa, summoning [[Care Bear]] [[archers]], giving spinach to Popeye, and replacing Jesus's sword with an [[M-60 machine gun]]).

[[The Pentagon]] is forced to admit the events about Imaginationland and their plan to nuke it, because [[Al Gore]] has leaked a video about [[ManBearPig]] (having taped ManBearPig's rampage in the previous episode). To proceed, the Supreme Court overturns the "Cartman vs. Brofloski decision" that imaginary creatures are real - imaginary creatures are declared not really, so the government can nuke Imaginationland. Now, Kyle legally no longer has to suck Cartman's balls, but Stan instructs Kyle to stall the launch. Kyle leaves the hospital, with Cartman following closely behind. 

Cartman sneaks into the Pentagon again, quickly followed by Kyle. Kyle convinces the officials to not nuke Imaginationland by arguing that imaginary creatures are just as real as real people because of their impact on the real world. Cartman responds by telling Kyle that if what he just said is true, then he still has to suck Cartman's balls. Kyle finally snaps and berates Cartman for being ignorant of the danger Stan and Butters are in just because of their bet and that regardless of who won it, Kyle would rather go to jail than humiliate himself by sucking Cartman's balls ("''They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am '''NEVER''' going to suck your balls '''EVER!''' So there!''"). Just when it seems like everything is going to be alright, Al Gore barges into the room, asking why the nuke hasn't been launched yet. When he finds out that the launch sequence has been aborted, he screams that ManBearPig has to die before mashing at the portal's control panel to try and launch the nuke, which causes the portal to destabilize and suck everyone in the room, as well as the nuke, into Imaginationland. 

The good characters' victory is interrupted by the nuke's explosion, destroying everything and everyone, including the retreating evil characters and the people from the real world (including Stan, Kyle, and Cartman) and leaving nothing but a vast white emptiness. Butters, on the other hand, somehow survives the explosion and restores the realm with his imagination, back to how it was before the initial terrorist attack. Everyone is alive again, the evil imaginary characters are imprisoned once again, and everyone cheers for Butters for saving the day. Cartman acknowledges Butters for using his imagination to restore everything, realizing the power of the realm, and as a treat, he creates duplicates of himself and Kyle, in which imaginary Kyle sucks imaginary Cartman's balls (off screen). Kyle angrily states the scene is imaginary, to which Cartman insists that, in one's imagination, imaginary creatures are "real", as Kyle himself said earlier. This angers Kyle a lot, seeing himself so humiliated by this. 

Butters wakes up in the real world, in his bedroom. His parents come in, and he tells them about the dream he just had. They inform Butters that it wasn't a dream, as they read about it in a newspaper, but they proceed to ground him for not coming back from Imaginationland in time to do chores. Distraught by this, Butters tries to use his powers to get out of being grounded, but is told by his parents that his powers only work in Imaginationland, and not in the real world. Disappointed, Butters lays back in bed and ends the episode with a low, unhappy mutter of "''Aw, shit''" which is uncensored.
