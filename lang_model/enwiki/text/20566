'''Reginald Walter Darcy Weaver''' (18 July 1876{{ndash}}12 November 1945) was an [[Australia]]n conservative parliamentarian who served in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for 28 years. Serving from 1917 in the backbenches, he entered the cabinet of [[Thomas Bavin]] in 1929 as Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests until he returned to opposition in 1930. Following the success of the [[United Australia Party]] in the 1932 election, Weaver returned as the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Health in the [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Stevens]] ministry. 

In 1935 he was dropped from the ministry but was later elected as the [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1937, holding office until the Mair Government lost power in 1941. Weaver then witnessed the death of the United Australia Party in 1943 and became the leader of the new [[Democratic Party (New South Wales)|Democratic Party]] in 1944. He was then involved in the negotiations to form the future [[Liberal Party of Australia]], which were ultimately successful, with Weaver becoming the first leader of the Liberal Party in April 1945. He served only briefly until dying of a heart attack in November 1945.<ref name=adb>{{cite web| first=Helen| last=Bourke| title =Weaver, Reginald Walter Darcy (1876 - 1945)| publisher =[[Australian National University]]| work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120470b.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>

==Early life==
Reginald Weaver was born at Kickerbill station, [[Quirindi, New South Wales]], on the [[Liverpool Plains]], the twelfth child of [[England|English]]-born parents Richard Weaver and his wife Fanny Seymour Weaver (n<U+00E9>e Walker). Weaver was educated at [[Newington College]] (1890<U+2013>1894) in Sydney<ref>Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp 210</ref> before joining two of his brothers in a [[Stock and station agent|stock and station agency]] in [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]] and then branching out on his own at [[Condobolin, New South Wales|Condobolin]] and  [[Narrandera, New South Wales|Narrandera]]. A member of the [[National Party of Australia|Farmers and Settlers' Association]], Weaver first entered politics when he was elected as an [[Alderman]] on [[Lachlan Shire|Condobolin Municipal Council]] from 1898 to 1900 and then later as an Alderman on [[Narrandera Shire|Narrandera Municipal Council]] in 1902.<ref name=adb/> On 19 April 1899 he married Gertrude Susan Bond Walker at [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney]].<ref name=adb/>

==Early political career==
In 1910, Weaver, now living in [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], contested the [[Electoral district of Ashburnham|seat of Ashburnham]] for the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] but was defeated on 46-53% against the Labor Party's [[John Patrick Lynch|John Lynch]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Ashburnham - 1910| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1910/Ashburnham.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of [[Electoral district of Macquarie|Macquarie]] but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Macquarie - 1913| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1913/Macquarie.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> Weaver contested the result, accusing the Labor Party of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of [[Ballot stuffing|roll-stuffing]].<ref name=adb/> 

Moving to [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] in 1916, he established a real estate business and on 24 March 1917 entered the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] at the 1917 election, as the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] candidate for the seat of [[Electoral district of Willoughby|Willoughby]] with 51.68%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Willoughby - 1917| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1917/Willoughby.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> A fervent Imperialist and pro-conscriptionist, he was rejected as medically unfit for the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in 1916 but eventually enlisted on 23 August 1918. Raising over <U+00A3>25,000 in War Loans, Weaver was discharged from the Army on 2 December 1918.<ref name=adb/> When the Willoughby seat was abolished at the next election, Weaver contested the new multi-member electorate of [[Electoral district of North Shore|North Shore]], receiving 15.31% and the first seat on the electorate.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of North Shore - 1920| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1920/NorthShore.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> 

Suspicious of the Irish Catholic establishment, embodied by the Labor Party, Weaver joined the Protestant Federation in 1921 and became a sympathiser of the right-wing [[New Guard]].<ref name=nsw/> At the 1922 election, he was re-elected with an increased margin of 20.16%, gaining first place once again.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of North Shore - 1922| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1922/NorthShore.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> He served until, citing business reasons, he retired from parliament on 18 April 1925.<ref name=nsw>{{cite web| title =Mr Reginald Walter Darcy Weaver (1876 - 1945)| work =Members of Parliament| publisher =[[Parliament of New South Wales]]| url =http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/8c3e5317a69553d0ca256cbb007cb989?OpenDocument| accessdate = 2007-02-17 }}</ref>

==Minister of the Crown==
[[File:Weaver speech.jpg|left|thumb|upright|250px|Weaver, as Minister for Health, opening [[List of hospitals in New South Wales|Ryde District Hospital]] in 1934.]]
Weaver soon returned to politics, when on 8 October 1927, at the [[New South Wales state election, 1927|1927 election]], he was elected to the seat of [[Electoral district of Neutral Bay|Neutral Bay]] with 69.49%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1927| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1927/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> Rising to prominence within the party, Weaver gained a reputation as an independent-minded but powerful debater in the House, [[crossing the floor]] on many issues.<ref name=adb/>

Nevertheless, Weaver was appointed by Premier [[Thomas Bavin]] on 16 April 1929 as the [[List of New South Wales government agencies#Mineral Resources|Secretary for Mines]] and [[List of New South Wales government agencies#Environment|Minister for Forests]]. Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of non-union labour in the [[Rothbury, New South Wales|Rothbury]] coal mine. The resultant protests led to the [[Rothbury Riot]] and the death of one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the Labor Party.<ref name=adb/> This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the [[New South Wales state election, 1930|October 1930 election]], at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1930| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1930/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref>, by [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s [[Australian Labor Party]].<ref name=nsw/>

In opposition, Weaver witnessed the end of the Nationalist Party and was elected Deputy Leader of the new [[United Australia Party]] (UAP) in New South Wales in 1931. When Lang's Government was dismissed on 13 May 1932 by the Governor of New South Wales, [[Philip Game|Sir Philip Game]], an early election was called by caretaker-Premier and UAP Leader, [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]]. At the [[New South Wales state election, 1932|11 June 1932 election]], in which Weaver was returned with 80.70%<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1932| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1932/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref>, Stevens' UAP/Country Coalition gained 31 seats and won government. Stevens had already appointed Weaver as the [[New South Wales Department of Planning|Secretary for Public Works]] and [[New South Wales Department of Health|Minister for Health]] on 16 May 1932.<ref name=nsw/> 

A competent, if controversial member of the cabinet, Weaver, as Minister for Health, travelled extensively and concentrated on the expansion of hospitals, becoming Director of [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] (1929-1930). His determination to exert more control over hospitals and the banning of honorary doctors from local hospital boards brought him into conflict with the NSW branch of the [[British Medical Association]]. His strict control over Hospital administrators brought him into conflict with the medical community and he was eventually dropped from the cabinet on 10 February 1935 by Premier Stevens, who found him "too extreme in personal independence" and possessing a "needlessly sharp tongue."<ref name=adb/> Weaver returned to the backbenches and won re-election at the [[New South Wales state election, 1935|1935 election]] on 11 May with an increased margin of 88.42%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1935| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1935/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> On 3 July 1935, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], on the advice of the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]], granted him retention of the title "[[The Honourable]]", for having served more than three years on the [[Executive Council of New South Wales]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34190 |startpage=5267 |date=3 July 1935|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref>

==Later career==
[[File:Reginald Weaver.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Weaver as Speaker in 1941.]]
When [[Daniel Levy (politician)|Sir Daniel Levy]] retired from parliament, Weaver was elected as the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the Legislative Assembly on 4 August 1937. In 1938, he was cleared by a judicial inquiry, chaired by [[Percival Halse Rogers|Sir Percival Halse Rogers]], into Jack Lang's allegations of fraud and corruption in the sale of state enterprises in 1933 when Weaver was the [[New South Wales Department of Planning|Secretary for Public Works]].<ref name=adb/> At the [[New South Wales state election, 1938|1939 election]] Weaver was returned uncontested.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1938| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1938/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> He served as Speaker until the succeeding government of [[Alexander Mair]] was defeated at the [[New South Wales state election, 1941|May 1941 election]] by the Labor Party under [[William McKell]]. Weaver was returned in his seat uncontested.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1941| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1941/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> 

However, with the very poor results of the federal United Australia Party under [[Billy Hughes]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 Federal election]], the UAP disintegrated. A large number of former UAP members then formed the [[Democratic Party (New South Wales)|Democratic Party]] in New South Wales, led by Mair, who became Opposition Leader, while others moved into the [[Commonwealth Party (New South Wales)|Commonwealth Party]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (New South Wales)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17863778|title= New Party and Mr Menzies|work=Sydney Morning Herald 22 January 1944 p1 |publisher=Australian National Library|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> With the conservative vote split in half, Mair had little chance, and resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, to be replaced by Weaver, who then became Party Leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Leader of the Opposition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17887060|title= Mr Mair resigns|work=Sydney Morning Herald 10 February 1944 p4 |publisher=Australian National Library|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> Weaver then led the party to the [[New South Wales state election, 1944|1944 election]] where it won 19% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. Weaver himself retained his seat with 56.90%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1944| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1944/NeutralBay.htm| accessdate = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> 

Weaver's efforts to merge the Democratic Party with the Liberal Democratic Party were deadlocked over questions of party organisation and by acrimony between  himself and the Party leader, Ernest K White. However, in December 1944 both parties agreed to enter the new [[Liberal Party of Australia]] formed by [[Robert Menzies]] and Weaver was elected as the first [[Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party]] on 20 April 1945.<ref name=nsw/> His term as Liberal Leader was to prove short-lived, however. After suffering a mild heart attack in the Legislative Assembly chamber on the evening of 7 November 1945, he drove himself home and died a week later on 12 November 1945 at [[Hornsby Hospital]], survived by his wife, son and three daughters.<ref name=nsw/> At the resulting [[Neutral Bay state by-election, 1945|by-election]] on 15 December, Neutral Bay was retained by the Liberal Party candidate, [[Ivan Black]], against a single Independent candidate with 56%.<ref>{{cite web| last = Green| first = Antony| title = Elections for the District of Neutral Bay - 1945 (by)| work = New South Wales Elections Database| publisher = Parliament of New South Wales| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1944/NeutralBay_1.htm| accessdate = 2011-02-02 }}</ref>
