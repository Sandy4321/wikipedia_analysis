'''Joseph "Hungry Joe" Lewis''' (c. 1850-March 22, 1902?) was an American criminal and swindler. He was regarded as one of the top [[confidence man|confidence]] and [[bunco|bunco men]] in the United States during the late 19th century whose success was matched only by contemporaries such as [[Tom O'Brien (swindler)|Tom O'Brien]] and [[Charles P. Miller]], sharing the title of "King of the Banco Men" with both men at various times in his career. <ref name="Asbury">[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]].

Over a period of thirty years, Lewis amassed a huge personal fortune almost solely through targeting wealthy bankers, merchants and other prominent figures. This was most often because more of a profit could be made while they were less likely to report the crime to police. Among his more well-known victims included General [[John A. Logan]], Judge [[Noah Davis]], [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] and, most notably, Irish author [[Oscar Wilde]]. <ref name="Asbury"/> <ref name="Hyde"/>

==Biography==
===Early criminal career===
Originally from [[Chicago, Illinois]], Lewis had several run-ins with the law during the 1880s and early 90s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the shooting of Boston thief Billy Flynn in [[Detroit]] but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the aquaintence of Gen. [[John A. Logan]] and, one night while dining with him at the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]], a [[Hotel Detective|hotel detective]] informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked ''"Why sir, that man is one of my best friends. You have made a terrible mistake here"''. Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] and lured the elderly man into a [[Boston Commons]] banco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in [[Philadelphia]], he represented himself to [[Samuel J. Randall]] as the son of banker [[Anthony Joseph Drexel I|A.J. Drexel]]. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home. He and another noted banco man, "Western Sam", spent an entire summer in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] where the conned over $100,000 from residents. <ref name="Article">"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CEED8123EE333A25750C0A9639C94679ED7CF Hungry Joe" To Be Released.; Alvany, the Bunko Man, Will Soon Complete His Prison Term]". <u>New York Times.</u> 3 May 1896</ref> 

The most famous of victims was perhaps English author [[Oscar Wilde]] whom he met in [[New York City]] while visiting the U.S. on a lecture tour in 1882. Lewis dined with Wilde at the Hotel Brunswick for several days before managing to persuade Wilde in joining a banco game. Wilde lost $5,000 and gave Lewis a check for the Park National Back, but afterwards stopped payment when he learned he had been swindled. Lewis later claimed that he had taken $1,500 in cash from Wilde before he was discovered. <ref name="Asbury"/> <ref name="Hyde"/> Inspector [[Thomas F. Byrnes]], then head of the NYPD Detective's Bureau, later commented that when Wilde himself had "reaped a harvest of American dollars with his curls, sun flowers and knee-britches" he was no less a swindler then Lewis ''"only not quite so sharp"''. <ref>Klein, Marcus. ''Easterns, Westerns, and Private Eyes: American Matters, 1870-1900''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1994. (pg. 170) ISBN 0-299-14304-X</ref> 

===Years in New York City===
Lewis became so infamous in New York City, his base of operations for many years, that he was once thrown out of the Twenty-Ninth Precinct by Captain [[Alexander S. Williams|Alexander "Clubber" Williams]] having recognized him as the man who attempted to con his brother while on the Pavona Ferry in 1884. <ref name="Article2">"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04EED91739E533A25751C2A9639C94649FD7CF King Of The Bunko Men.; Hungry Joe Becomes A Vulgar Robber. Stealing 50 From A Wealthy English Manufacturer--Likely To Make A Visit To Sing Sing]". <u>New York Times.</u> 22 May 1885</ref>

Lewis was arrested with a young protege, Oliver Wilson, while attempting to draw in victims for a local bunco game in [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] on April 21, 1885. Police had received reports that there had been bunco men operating in the district as county merchants were arriving in the city to make their annual spring purchases. When police officers arrived at the scene, they ''"saw them accost a number of persons, shake hands with them, and act in the manner of "bunco steerers"''. They were tried at the Jefferson Market Police Court the following day on a charge of [[disorderly conduct]]. Lewis explained away the charges by pointing out that he did not collect a crowd, obstruct the sidewalk, use profane or improper language or any other cause which legally defined "disorderly conduct". He also denied having "accosted strangers" stating to the judge ''"I am not in the habit of accosting strangers. I spoke to and shook hands with several friends. That is the way, I believe, that gentlemen greet one another in the street. I did nothing to justify this arrest"''. One of these men, Lewis claimed, had asked him directions to the [[Astor Library]] at which time he was arrested. Despite his defense, he and Wilson were both fined $10. Though both men were well-dressed and ''"wore what appeared to be gold-mounted chains"'' had neither watches or indeed any collateral to pay for their release. <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9506E4DD1130E433A25750C2A9629C94649FD7CF "Hungry Joe" Locked Up; Arrested While Breaking In A Young Recruit]". <u>New York Times.</u> 23 Apr 1885</ref>

A month later, Lewis attempted to swindle wealthy British manufacturer Joseph Ramsden while vacationing in New York for his health. Shortly after his arrival from [[Manchester, England]], on which he had traveled on the Cunard steamer ''Gallia'', he booked into a Broadway hotel. Lewis approached Ramsden the next day while taking a walk down Broadway. He greeted Ramsden near the Metropolitan Hotel calling the surprised tourist by name and inquiring about his health. When Ransden expressed his astonishment at having been recognized by, in his view a total stranger, Lewis introduced himself as the nephew of the captain of the ''Gallia'' and who had "spoke very kindly of him". Claiming to be a manufacturer of [[undergarments|women's undergarments]] in [[Baltimore]], he then used the introduction to lure him to a bunco game. Lewis explained that he was preparing to leave for Baltimore but offered Ramsden to join him as he went to purchase tickets at a nearby railroad station. Ramsden agreed and the two walked together down Broadway while Lewis gave him a guided tour and pointing out businesses and giving exaggerated accounts of business dealing with various New York business firms. <ref name="Article2"/>

They eventually arrived at a building on [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] and proceeded to an office of the second floor where Lewis "bought" a ticket from a young man. While there, Lewis showed Ramsden his valise and showed him the various tools of his trade, mainly [[muslin]] and paint goods, before discovering a pack of cards at the bottom of the bag. He then demonstrated a card trick which he claimed had cost him $400 in a Bowery saloon the day before. Showing him how to play [[three-card monte]], the man who had sold Lewis the ticket encouraged Ramsden to play a hand. When Ramsden refused to bet however, the man attempted to provoke him claiming he had no money to bet with. He then asked Lewis to leave and, turning to the young man, he showed him a roll of bank notes from the [[Bank of England]] worth <U+20A4>50. At this point, Lewis grabbed the roll and ran out of the building. When the astonished Ramsden had recovered, he went outside to find Lewis but he had long since escaped. Similarly, he returned to the office to find the room and been emptied. <ref name="Article2"/>

On the advice of friends, Ramsden reported the incident to [[New York City Police Department|NYPD Police Headquarters]] whereupon Lewis was immediately identified as the suspect. This was the first charge of robbery ever brought against Lewis and the case against him was so great that Inspector Byrnes ordered an extensive city-wide search and that he be arrested on sight. Lewis managed to avoid capture for a time, the police unable to find him at his usual hangouts, however he was eventually spotted on Broadway by Inspector Byrnes and Detective Richard O'Connor who followed him to a house on [[Sixth Avenue]] where he was arrested. He was later identified by Ramsden in a [[police lineup]] with seven other men, although he continually denied the charge claiming his name as Henry F. Post. Although Lewis had been arrested numerous times, this was the first time Lewis convicted and he served four years in [[Sing Sing]]. <ref name="Article2"/>

In May 1888, Lewis was released after serving three years. Lewis was identified eight months later in the NYPD's "[[Rogue's Gallery]]" by William J. Bansemer, a wealthy and retired Baltimore merchant, who lost $5,000 to him in a bunco game. He was arrested in New York on December 1, 1888, and extradited to Baltimore to stand trial. <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9403E7DA1330E633A2575BC0A9649D94699FD7CF Victim of "Hungry Joe"]". <u>New York Times.</u> 8 Dec 1888</ref>

===Imprisonment in Baltimore===
On December 1, 1890, Lewis was convicted of having "bunkoed" Baltimore businessman William J. Bansemer out of $5,000. He was sentenced to nine years in the Maryland State Penitentiary but his term was reduced for good behavior and was released on June 20, 1896. Upon his release, he spoke out against his imprisonment claiming he had wrongly been convicted. He further claimed that he could have been able to provide an alibi had he been given the opportunity but that he had been advised by his lawyer to pled guilty in order to avoid a maximum 15-year jail sentence. Lewis blamed the "frame up" on Inspector Byrnes, whom he claimed had a long standing grudge against him, and used his influence to manipulate the police investigation and trial. He also made vague accusations regarding Bynes involvement in [[police misconduct]] and [[police corruption|corruption]], although nothing came of the charges. <ref name="Article"/>

{{cquote|''Byrnes has a grudge against me which dates back some years. It was on account of some money matters. I had made some $15,000 in Chicago - but never mind that. If I was disposed to tell all I knew, the public would have less confidence in Inspector Byrnes. If he had received all that he deserves, he, and not I, would to-day be serving time. It was he who prevented me from engaging in legitimate business. I had been offered $25,000 to go into the bookmaking business but Byrnes stepped in and broke me up.'' <ref name="Article"/>}} 

On the morning of his release, he was given $167 by Warden Weyler which he had earned during his last 18 months in prison. Lewis's health and appearance had reportedly been significantly affected during imprisonment, the ''[[New York Times]]'' noting ''"his powerful frame does not indicate the sprightliness and vigor of seven years ago. His keen eyes have dimmed, and his hair is sprinkled with silver"''. He then headed for New York where he claimed he intended to lead an honest life as a bookmaker and "follow the horse races". <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B05E0D81338E233A25752C2A9609C94679ED7CF Hungry Joe" Out Of Prison.; He Starts for New-York Intending to Become a Bookmaker]". <u>New York Times.</u> 21 Jun 1896</ref> 

===Death===
Lewis visited NYPD Police Headquarters upon his arrival in New York two days later and informed Captain Stephen O'Brien, who had since succeeded Byrnes as Chief of Detectives, of his intentions. <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F07E5D71338E233A25750C2A9609C94679ED7CF "Hungry Joe" Comes To Town]". <u>New York Times.</u> 23 Jun 1896</ref> He apparently remained true to his word and, as of early-1902, was witnessed by Captain [[George McClusky]] working as a [[cigar|cigar vendor]] in the [[Bowery]]. On March 22, 1902, Lewis's death was reported by NYPD police officials and announced in the ''New York Times'' and the ''[[New York Sun]]'' the following day. <ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504EFD9103DEE32A25750C2A9659C946397D6CF "Hungry Joe" Reported Dead]". <u>New York Times.</u> 23 Mar 1902</ref> The report could not be verified however, his death having once been falsely reported in Baltimore, and his name was not listed in the [[New York City Board of Health]]. His friends responded that he had died in an apartment house on Manhattan's West Side and that his funeral had been held three days after his death. The name on the coffin, they claimed, was one which he would not be recognized so he could be buried anonymously. <ref>"Hungry Joe" Reported Dead.; But The Famous Bunco Man Has Been Dead Before. Died Here This Time; Last Time It Was in Baltimore - Among the Swindler's Dupes Were Gen. Logan, Oscar Wilde, Judge Noah Davis and C.F. Adams". <u>New York Sun.</u> 23 Mar 1902</ref>
