The '''Flyers<U+2013>Senators brawl''' was a [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) regular season game between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[Ottawa Senators]] that resulted in a league-record for [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty minutes]]. The game was played on March 5, 2004 at the [[Wachovia Center]], the home arena of the Flyers. Philadelphia won the game by the score 5<U+2013>3. In all, 419 minutes were assessed, passing the previous NHL record of 406. The 213 minutes assessed against Philadelphia were also a record, as were the number of penalty minutes in the third period.

The incidents were precipitated by an incident in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's [[Martin Havlat]] had swung his stick at [[Mark Recchi]]'s head. Just under two minutes before the end of the the brawl game, [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcers]] [[Donald Brashear]] of the Flyers and [[Rob Ray]] of the Senators engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the [[penalty box]], Brashear got involved in another scrap, and the rest of the players on the ice for each team, including [[goaltender]]s [[Robert Esche]] and [[Patrick Lalime]] began to fight. On both of the next two [[face-off]]s to restart the game, further fights occurred. The first instance angered the Flyers' management, who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players. 

On the third restart after the initial fight, the crowd booed when a fight did not immediately ensue, but in less than 30 seconds two more fights had broken out. The final fight occurred directly after the fourth face-off, involving [[Jason Spezza]] and [[Patrick Sharp]]. Spezza and Brashear were assessed for the most penalty minutes in the game, receiving 35 and 34 respectively. At the start of the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], the NHL introduced a rule that punished anyone instigating a fight in the final five minutes of a game with a one-game suspension, in order to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future.

When the two sides met in late February, a week before the brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger [[Mark Recchi]] was following [[Martin Havlat]] of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooked]] Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashed]] Recchi, hitting him in the face.<ref name="cbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/02/27/Havlat0228.html |title=Senators' Havlat suspended for two games |date=March 5, 2004 |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref>

Havlat was given a five-minute [[major penalty]] for attempting to injure Recchi, along with a [[game misconduct]] penalty. He was later given a two-game suspension by the NHL due to the incident. He was forced to give up [[United States dollar|US$]]36,585.36 of his salary as he had already been suspended for kicking [[Eric Cairns]] of the [[New York Islanders]] earlier in the season.<ref name="cbc"/>

Revenge was mentioned after the game by [[Ken Hitchcock]], the head coach for the Flyers. During a post game interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), he commented that "someday, someone's going to make him eat his lunch. This is something, in my opinion, that the players should take care of."<ref name="cbc"/> Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during an interview with the CBC. "It doesn't surprise me coming from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," said Recchi.<ref name="cbc"/>

==Game summary==
Despite having what Rob Maaddi of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' described as "bad blood" between them, the first period of the game passed without serious incident. [[Chris Neil]] opened the scoring for Ottawa just over 4 minutes into the period, but the Flyers then took the lead when [[Claude Lapointe]] and [[Mark Recchi]] scored 30 seconds apart. [[Danny Markov]] added a third for Philadelphia to give them a two-goal lead. The only [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]] assessed in the period was for [[Penalty (ice hockey)#List of infractions|holding]] against Philadelphia's [[Tony Amonte]].<ref name="boxscore"/> In the second period, an early tripping penalty against Ottawa's [[Mike Fisher (ice hockey)|Mike Fisher]] put the Flyers on the [[Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey|power play]], during which [[Kim Johnsson]] extended Philadelphia's lead to 4<U+2013>1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent [[Todd Simpson]] to the [[penalty box]] for holding. A Flyers penalty against [[Radovan Somik]] for slashing [[Martin Havlat]] resulted in a power play goal for the Senators' [[Zdeno Chara]], closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.<ref name="boxscore"/>

The third period began with [[Alexei Zhamnov]] notching the Flyers' fifth goal of the game to make it 5<U+2013>2. Shortly thereafter the game started to become more heated; Zhamnov and [[Daniel Alfredsson]] were assessed [[Minor penalty|coincidental minors]] for [[roughing]] nine minutes into the period, and three minutes later [[Bryan Smolinski]] and [[Mark Greig]] were similarly penalized. Simpson returned to the box soon after, for slashing [[Michal Handzus]], but Philadelphia's power play when cut short when they received a penalty for having too many men on the ice.<ref name="boxscore"/>

With 1 minute and 45 seconds left in the third period, the Flyers' [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] [[Donald Brashear]] hit [[Rob Ray]], an enforcer for the Senators, from behind, instigating a fight between the pair.<ref name="sheridan">{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118634245.html |title=NHL brass prefers vigilante justice |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |last=Sheridan |first=Phil |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> When he was asked after the game why he started the fight, Brashear replied with his own question; "Did you see the last game?"<ref name="morning">{{cite news |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2004-03-06/sports/3520430_1_flyers-coach-ken-hitchcock-flyers-goalie-robert-esche-danny-markov |title=Flyers slug their way past Ottawa, 5<U+2013>3 |work=''[[The Morning Call]]'' |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |location=[[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |last=Blockus |first=Gary |date=March 6, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> He reply was interpreted as being a reference to Havlat's slashing penalty against Recchi.<ref name="morning"/> Brashear was generally considered to win the fight, with Tim Panaccio of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' claiming that Brashear "destroyed Rob Ray".<ref name="pan">{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-113955532.html |title=Flyers brawl past the Senators |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |last=Panaccio |first=Tim |date=March 5, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> The fight left Ray bloodied, and as Brashear was being escorted off the ice by the [[Official (ice hockey)|linesman]], he exchanged blows with both [[Brian Pothier]] and [[Todd Simpson]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yxBDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Hockey Fights: The NHL's Toughest Fighters 2000<U+2013>2010 |last=D'Ambrosio |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian D'Ambrosio |year=2010 |publisher=Jabberwocky Press |asin=B009305TKY |page=27 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> Philadelphia's [[Patrick Sharp]] attempted to restrain Simpson, who then pushed Sharp to the ice and started throwing punches at him.

The game restarted with two new goaltenders and the Senators on the power play, but within three seconds the fighting started again; Ottawa's [[Chris Neil]] poked [[Radovan Somik]] with his stick, and the pair started scrapping.<ref name="pan"/> At the same time, [[Zdeno Chara]] started a fight with the Flyers' [[Mattias Timander]], for which he received an instigator penalty.<ref name="boxscore"/> Both fights angered Philadelphia's head coach, Hitchcock, who claimed that "Their tough guy (Ray) got beat up and then their next two lines fought guys who don't fight."<ref name="world"/> The Flyer's general manager, [[Bobby Clarke|Bob Clarke]], was also critical, saying "I understand Rob Ray fighting Donald Brashear.

Immediately after the ensuing [[face-off]], [[Michal Handzus]] and [[Mike Fisher]] took part in the seventh fight of the game.<ref name="goodbad"/>

There were no fights straight after the next restart, which resulted in booing from the crowd. Within 24 second of that restart, the crowd had their way; [[Mark Recchi]] hit [[Wade Redden]], who immediately launched himself into a fight with [[John LeClair]]. While those two fought, Recchi and [[Bryan Smolinski]] engaged in a second fight in the middle of the rink.<ref name="goodbad"/> LeClair received an additional penalty for holding, placing the Senators on the power play. At the next face-off, a fight once again broke out straight away, between [[Jason Spezza]] and Sharp. Spezza received a fighting major, a misconduct and double game misconduct, totalling 35 penalty minutes, the most of any player in the game.<ref name="nhlboxscore">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2003021001 |title=Ottawa Senators at Philadelphia Flyers <U+2013> 03/05/2004: Boxscore |publisher=[[National Hockey League]] |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The media drew comparisons between the game and the "Broad Street Bullies" era of the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1970s, when they played very aggressive hockey with lots of fights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=240305015 |title=Five brawls break out in final two minutes |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=March 5, 2004 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/scores104/104065/20040305NHL--PHILADELPH0.htm |title=Ottawa vs. Philadelphia |work=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=March 5, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg3v8hQsAdAC&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Now You Know Hockey |last=Lennox |first=Doug |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2008 | isbn=978-1-55002-869-0 |page=41 |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> At the conclusion of the game, Philadelphia's general manager, Clarke, tried to enter the Senators' dressing room to confront their head coach, [[Jacques Martin (ice hockey)|Jacques Martin]].

Philadelphia-based [[Comcast SportsNet]] (CSN), which had aired the game live, described it as an "instant classic", replayed the game the following Wednesday (March 10).<ref name="sheridan"/> The replayed received a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 1.0, a higher figure than most telecasts involving the Philadelphia Flyers. League officials from the NHL were unhappy with the replay being shown, as they perceived the game to tarnish the league's image, and they requested that CSN did not replay the game again.<ref name="goodbad"/>

The Flyers and the Senators met once more during the season, and despite some bluster from Clarke that Philadelphia would seek further revenge, there were only six minor penalties assessed in the match, which the Senators won 3<U+2013>1. Ottawa defenseman Chara explained that "both teams were really focusing on the two points. We weren't going to risk that by fighting."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93083484.html |title=Flyers and Senators behave in rematch |last=Podell |first=Ira |work=[[Associated Press|AP Worldstream]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 3, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> Both teams qualified for the [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs]]; Ottawa were eliminated in the first-round by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], while Philadelphia defeated the [[New Jersey Devils]] and [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] to reach the Conference Finals, but were then beaten by the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/NHL_2004.html |title=2004 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Summary |work=Hockey-Reference |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

The brawl, along with [[Todd Bertuzzi<U+2013>Steve Moore incident|an incident]] between the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and [[Steve Moore]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]], (in which Bertuzzi hit Moore from behind, breaking his neck, in retaliation for a hit by Moore on one of Bertuzzi's team-mates a month earlier), brought the issue of violence in ice hockey into focus. Particular attention was given to retaliation; when Brashear was interviewed on the subject of the Bertuzzi incident he defended such on-ice revenge, and suggested that Bertuzzi should not receive a suspension, because "all they have to do is go after him when he comes back."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118634244.html |title=Brashear understands Bertuzzi's intention of intimidation |last=Panaccio |first=Tim |work=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> That mindset echoed the comments made by Hitchcock and Recchi about Havlat,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118634245.html |title=NHL brass prefers vigilante justice |last=Sheridan |first=Phil |work=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> and Sam Donnellon of the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all the players in the league. He suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play, (which he advocated), the players believed that removing the penalty for instigating a fight, and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means, would have the same effect.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-114191284.html |title=NHL's problems are wide in scope |last=Donnellon |first=Sam |work=''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |location=[[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] |date=March 12, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> Mike Heika of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' also believed that the league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions, suggesting that Hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments, and that if Havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions the brawl between the Flyers and Senators may not have happened.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-114214447.html |title=NHL's sense of justice tough to accept |last=Heika |first=Mike |work=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |location=[[Dallas]], [[Texas|TX]] |date=March 13, 2004 |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}</ref> 

The [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL season]] was [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|cancelled]] because of a labor dispute, but upon the league's return in [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005]], a rule was added which meant that any player being assessed for a instigator penalty in the last five minutes of a match would receive an automatic one-game ban, and the player's head coach could also be fined. This was designed to avoid situations such as happened in game between the Flyers and Senators, and addressed the fact that physical play tended to increase towards the end of a game, particularly when the result was not in question.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8hCikPvWGsEC&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Violence and Aggression in Sporting Contests: Economics, History and Policy |editor-last=Jewell |editor-first=R.
