'''Sydney John Bunney''' (1877-1928) was an English late Impressionist artist who left over 500 drawings of Coventry in the early twentieth century.<ref>Mallalieu, H.L. <i>The Dictionary of British Watercolour Artists up to 1920</i>, p.47</ref>

Little is known of Bunney's life. In 1892 he was a student at Coventry School of Art.<ref> Clarke, Ron. <i>Sydney Bunney's Coventry: impressions of a graceful city</i> 1999</ref> He maintained contact with the School for many years, becoming the first Secretary to the School's Sketch Club in April 1907.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref> He resigned from the post three years later but remained a member of the club until 1916.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref>

Bunney's work as an artist matured under the influence of Williams Milnes, who became the head master at Coventry School of Art in 1906.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref> Milnes encouraged students to follow the example of [[J._M._W._Turner|Turner]] by taking quick sketches under different conditions. This, according to Milnes, would give the artist a greater understanding of nature in its various moods. Many of Coventry's medieval buildings had survived up to the early Twentieth-Century, and Milnes pointed out that many of the buildings were suitable for studies in the effect of light.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref> Several students took up this idea, including H.E. Cox, but Bunney became a prolific painter of Coventry scenes. His body of work records the city as a market town, the streets lined with red brick and half-timbered shops and houses.<ref>Bell, Lucy, <b>Coventry Evening Telegraph</b> December 17 1999</ref> Most of these pieces are small and intimate works of art.

He had great difficulty in having his work exhibited at any of the big shows, such as those at the Royal Academy, and his work largely disappeared before being rediscovered in the late twentieth-century.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref>

Bunney became a cashier at the Auto Machinery Company Limited in Coventry and, in his later years, lived at 154 Albany Street, Earlsdon, Coventry.<ref>Clarke 1999</ref>
