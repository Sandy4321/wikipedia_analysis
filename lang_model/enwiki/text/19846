'''''Ammandra''''' is a [[monotypic]] [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]] in the [[arecaceae|palm]] family found in [[South America]] where it is [[endangered]].  The sole species is '''''Ammandra decasperma''''', although another species has been recognized. They are a [[pinnate]]-leaved, [[dioecious]] palm whose [[seeds]] and [[petioles]] are used in button and basket making, respectively.  It is commonly called '''Ivory palm''' or '''cabecita'''.
==Description==
''A. decasperma'' grows in multi-headed clusters, the trunks usually remaining underground or prostrate upon it.  Despite the negligible trunk size, the [[leaves]] reach over 6 m long, slightly arching, on 2 m petioles.  The linear leaflets are dark green, 60-90 cm long, and emerge from the rachis in the same plane.  In male plants the [[inflorescence]] is a long spike covered in short branches of white to yellow flowers, the female's being much shorter and more compact.  The round [[fruit]] grows in clusters of 3-6 and is covered in pointed warts, each fruit containing six or more kidney shaped [[seeds]].<ref name=uhl>Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) ''Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E.

==Taxonomy==
The type species described by Cook was ''Ammandra decasperma''; a similar population was found being geographically separated and with minor flower differences and was designated ''A. dasyneura'' (Burret).  In September 2001 Bernal et al. published the discovery of an ''Ammandra'' population located between the other two with floral characteristics represented in both groups.  They, and other taxonomists since, concluded that the three populations were of a single species (see distribution map). <ref name=riffle>Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) ''An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms''.

Separately, the only species in the closely related ''[[Aphandra]]'' genus, ''Aphandra natalia'', was initially described as ''Ammandra natalia'' but was later given its own genus.
The genus name translates from [[Greek language|Greek]] to "sand man", alluding to their inflorescences which are formed at ground level, often beneath the soil, and the species epithet derives from two [[Latin]] words meaning "ten" and "seed", describing the maximum number of seeds per fruit.

==Distribution and habitat==
These palms grow in the foothills of the [[Andes]] mountains, along [[Colombia]]'s west coast as well as inland [[Ecuador]] up to 450 m in elevation.  In either case, they are an understory plant usually recieving only filtered light and nearly year-round rainfall.
==Cultivation and uses==
''Ammandra'' is not common in cultivation outside its natural range but when grown requires wet and warm conditions resembling the rain forest and will not tolerate full sun.  It also prefers free-draining, highly organic soil.  
In Colombia, their large, strong petioles are commonly woven into baskets and other thatched goods, while the large white seeds, commonly called "vegetable ivory", are carved into buttons and trinkets. <ref name=riffle/>
