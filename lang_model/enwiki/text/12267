'''Briery Creek Wildlife Management Area''' is a [[protected area]] located in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia]].  With [[terrain]] typical of south-central [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], it sits along [[Briery Creek Lake]], which was formed by the [[dam]]ming of [[Briery Creek]] and [[Little Briery Creek]].  Much of the area was used for [[timber]] production until recently; today the land contains a mixture of [[hardwood]]s and [[loblolly pine]].  [[Hunt]]ing and [[fishing]] are allowed on the property.
