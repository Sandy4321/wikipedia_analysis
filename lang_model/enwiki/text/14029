Lieutenant-Colonel '''Arthur Herbert Tennyson Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (20 March 1887, [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight]]&ndash;14 July 1944, [[Eastnor Castle]], [[Hereford]]), son of Herbert Haldane Somers-Cocks by Blanche Margaret Standish Clogstoun, was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Administrator of the Government|administrator]] and served as the 16th [[Governor]] of the State of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] between 1926 and 1931. 

He was appointed as [[Chief Scout (United Kingdom)|Chief Scout]] of the British Empire in March 1941, on the death of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]], the founder of the Scout Movement, who had been Chief Scout of the World.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs295307.pdf |title=Meet the Chiefs |accessdate=2007-12-08 |month=October | year=2004 |publisher=The Scout Information Centre }}</ref>  He served until his death in 1944. He was succeeded by [[Thomas Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan|Lord Rowallan]].

Lord Somers married Daisy Finola Meeking in 1921 and had issue, an only daughter:
* Hon. (Violet) Elizabeth Verena Somers-Cocks (1922-1986), who married Brigadier Benjamin Alexander Frederick Hervey-Bathurst (1920-1997), 2nd son of Sir Frederick Edward William Hervey-Bathurst, 5th Bt.

In 1929, at his own expense, he brought together teenage boys from different backgrounds to what was named Lord Somers' Camp and Power House, a youth organization which continues to this day. Somers revisited Australia and his camp in 1933, and again in 1937 when, as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, he accompanied the English touring team.

He was also an able [[cricket]]er: he made 115 for [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] against [[Westminster School|Westminster]] as a schoolboy in 1904, and made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut two years later for [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. He rarely had enough time to play cricket, but in the 1920s he made a further 16 first-class appearances ''for'' Worcestershire, his highest score being 52 against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in May 1925. Lord Somers became both a vice-president of Worcestershire CCC and, in 1936, President of MCC.<ref name="Wisden">''Obituaries, 1944.'' [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]], 1945.</ref>

He should not be confused with the [[Arthur Somers-Cocks]] who played ten games for [[Barbadian cricket team|Barbados]] around the turn of the twentieth century.
