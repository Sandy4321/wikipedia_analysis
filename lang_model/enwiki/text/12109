==Plot== 
An unnamed, thirtysomething [[Dublin]] [[busker]] (listed in the credits as "Guy" and played by Glen Hansard) sings and plays guitar on [[Grafton Street]],  a [[Dublin]] shopping district, struggling with the trials of performing on the street, including chasing after a [[heroin]] addict (Darren Healy) who attempts to steal his earnings. Lured by his music, an unnamed young [[Czechs|Czech]] immigrant flower seller (listed in the credits as "Girl", played by Mark<U+00E9>ta Irglov<U+00E1>) approaches him impertinently during one of his late night street performances and, despite his annoyance, persists in questioning him about his songs. Upon learning that he also repairs vacuum cleaners in his father's shop, she insists that he fix her broken vacuum.

The next day she brings her [[vacuum cleaner|Hoover]] by and parlays it into lunch together, whereupon she piques his interest by telling him that she's a musician too. He asks to hear her play, so they visit a music store where she regularly plays piano. After teaching her one of his songs ("Falling Slowly"), which she picks up easily, they sing and play the song together, kindling a musical and potentially romantic connection. He invites her and her ailing vacuum back to his father's shop, and on the bus home musically answers her question as to what his songs are about: a long-time girlfriend who cheated on him, then left ("Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy"). At the shop, he repairs her vacuum and she meets his father (Bill Hodnett), who seems indifferent to his son's musical talent. The Guy takes the Girl up to his room, but when he asks her to stay the night, she is insulted and leaves. The next day, he apologizes and they quickly patch things up, as over the course of a week they excitedly write, rehearse and record songs, and get to know each other. Songs continue to be performed in a real-world, [[diagetic]] fashion, often in their entirety, as when the Girl rehearses her lyrics for one of the Guy's songs (which she entitles "If You Want Me"), singing to herself while walking down the street, or when at a party, people perform impromptu (including "Gold", performed by a trio featuring guitarist Hansard singing harmony).

Their flirtation continues, but at the same time, he is thinking about and writing about ("Lies") his ex-girlfriend (Marcella Plunkett), who moved to [[London]]. The Girl encourages him to move there, win his girlfriend back and pursue his musical career. Invited home to dinner by the Girl, the Guy discovers that she has a baby (Kate Haugh) and lives with her mother (Danuse Ktrestova). He soon decides that it is time to move to London, but he wants to make a high-quality [[Demo (music)|demo]] of his songs to take with him and asks the Girl to record it with him. She takes the lead as they secure a [[bank loan]]&mdash;from a bank where the loan officer (Sean Miller) is a musical hobbyist&mdash;and reserve time at a professional [[recording studio|studio]]. On a romantic motorbike jaunt, she reveals, much to his consternation, that she's married, though her estranged husband is back in the [[Czech Republic]]. When the Guy asks if she still loves her husband, she answers in [[Czech language|Czech]] and coyly declines to translate what she said. After recruiting a trio of musicians (Gerard Hendrick, Alaistair Foley, Hugh Walsh), they rehearse, then go into the studio to record. Their lack of experience shows, but they quickly impress the jaded studio engineer Eamon (Geoff Minogue) once they begin recording their first song ("When Your Mind's Made Up"). On a break in the wee hours of the morning, the Girl finds a piano in an empty studio and finally plays the Guy one of her own compositions ("The Hill"), though she breaks down before finishing the song, which tells of romantic frustration. He responds by asking her to come with him to London, but isn't prepared for the reality of her mother coming along to help with the baby.

Still, he is smitten. After the session wraps up successfully, he asks her to spend his last night in Dublin with him; she says that it would only result in "[[hanky-panky]]," which is a "bad idea", yet she ultimately agrees to come over. But in the end, she stands him up and he can't find her to say goodbye before his flight. He plays the demo for his father, who, moved and impressed, gives him money to help him get settled in London. Before leaving for the airport, the Guy buys the Girl a piano and makes arrangements for its delivery, then calls his ex-girlfriend, who is happy about his imminent arrival. The Girl's husband (Senan Haugh) moves to Dublin and they reunite. But the final shots convey how the Girl and the Guy were deeply affected by their short time together.

==Production==
Neither of the two leads is a trained or experienced actor; Hansard and Irglov<U+00E1> are both professional musicians.<ref name="NY Times">[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/movies/16once.html ''The New York Times'' review] from May 16, 2007</ref> Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band [[The Frames]], had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead to be played by actor [[Cillian Murphy]],<ref name="CHUD.com">[http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=interviews&id=10230 CHUD.com cast and director interview] from May 14, 2007</ref> who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting.<ref name="Observer O'Hagan">O'Hagan, Sean.

Accessed [[8 August]] [[2006]].</ref> Murphy was also going to be one of the film's producers. But Murphy balked at acting opposite non-actor Irglov<U+00E1> (then 17 years old) and at singing Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources.<ref name="Gazette">[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/qas/story.html?id=a66f6258-08e0-48a2-91a1-cf551b9b72f8&k=65530 ''The Gazette''] from April 14, 2007</ref> Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film [[The Commitments (film)|''The Commitments'']], the story of a Dublin [[soul music]] [[cover band]]. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.<ref name="Gazette">[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/qas/story.html?id=a66f6258-08e0-48a2-91a1-cf551b9b72f8&k=65530 ''The Gazette''] from April 14, 2007</ref> "Though I was initially thinking of using a good actor who could half sing, I quickly realized I should do it the other way around and get a good singer who could half act," Carney said in a Chicago interview.<ref name="HollywoodChicago.com">[http://www.hollywoodchicago.com/2007/05/for-once-carney-casts-musicians-not.html HollywoodChicago.com review] from May 27, 2007</ref>

Produced with a shoestring budget of only $160,000, about 75% of the budget was funded by Bord Scann<U+00E1>n na h<U+00C9>ireann (The Irish Film Board), plus some of Carney's own money. The director gave his salary to the two stars, and promised a share of the back-end for everyone if the film was a success. Shot with a skeleton crew on a 17-day shoot, the filmmakers saved money by using natural light and shooting at friends' houses.<ref name="Variety Weisman" /> The musical party scene was filmed in Hansard's own flat, with his personal friends playing the partygoers/musicians<ref name="interview">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrpklk-6Ec YouTube interview 3 of 4 with Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova]</ref>&mdash;his mother, Catherine Hansard, is briefly featured singing solo. The [[Dublin]] street scenes were done without permits and with a [[long lens]] so that many passersby didn't even realize that a film was being made. The long lens also helped the non-professional actors relax and forget about the camera, and some of the dialogue ended up being improvised.<ref name="Gazette">[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/qas/story.html?id=a66f6258-08e0-48a2-91a1-cf551b9b72f8&k=65530 ''The Gazette''] from April 14, 2007</ref>

Hansard and Irglova became a couple in real life, either during filming<ref name="Edmonton Sun">[http://www.edmontonsun.com/Entertainment/Showbiz/2007/06/08/4244154-sun.html ''Edmonton Sun''] from June 8, 2007</ref> or later while on a promotional tour across North America.<ref name="NY Post">[http://www.nypost.com/seven/05292007/gossip/pagesix/not_so_platonic_pagesix_.htm ''The New York Post''] Page Six from May 29, 2007</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' reported, {{cquote|''The chemistry between (the) two leads ... was easy to produce during the January 2006 shoot in Dublin. "I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid," says Hansard, 37, who has known his 19-year-old costar for the past six years. (The two are now dating.) "There was definitely the feeling we were documenting something precious and private."''<ref name="EW per-screen">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20042740,00.html ''Entertainment Weekly'': "'Once' a Hero"] from Jun 14, 2007</ref>}}

Yet the real-life couple was quite happy with the unrequited ending for their onscreen characters. In an interview, Hansard states that "Had [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] changed it, had they changed the end and made us kiss, I wouldn't be interested in coming and promoting it, at all."<ref name="interview">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrpklk-6Ec YouTube interview 3 of 4 with Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova]</ref>

Both Hansard and Irglova give the impression in interviews that they are unlikely to pursue further acting. Irglova has spoken about being nervous in front of a crew, saying "I don't think I would be a good actress, overall",<ref name="stv/movies">[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/stv_movies_once_interview Once video interview with ''[[stv.tv]]'']</ref> and Hansard generally refers to the movie as a one-off, talking of "moving on... living a different life".<ref name="stv/movies">[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/stv_movies_once_interview Once video interview with ''[[stv.tv]]'']</ref>

==Reception==
The film has achieved major acclaim, receiving the World Cinema Audience Award for a dramatic film at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]]. 

As of July 2, 2007, ''Once'' had high ratings from two popular film review aggregation sites: it was deemed 98% "fresh" at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]<ref name="rotten tomatoes">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/once/ Once at Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> and scored a grade of 88 ("universal acclaim") according to [[Metacritic]].<ref name="metacritic">[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/once?q=Once Metacritic entry for Once].</ref>

On the May 18, 2007 broadcast of the television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]'', both [[Richard Roeper]] and guest critic [[Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave enthusiastic reviews.  Phillips called it, "the most charming thing I've seen all year," "the ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' for the 21st century," and his favorite music film since 1984's ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''. Roeper referred to the film's recording studio scene as "more inspirational and uplifting than almost any number of ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' or ''[[Chicago (film)|Chicago]]'' or any of those multi-zillion  dollar musical showstopping films. In its own way, it will blow you away."<ref name="Ebert & Roeper">[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/ ''Ebert & Roeper'' review] from the weekend of May 18, 2007</ref> 

Acclaimed filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] was quoted as saying "A little movie called ''Once'' gave me enough inspiration to last the rest of the year."<ref name="Go and see Once">Breznican, Anthony.
