The '''stingrays''' are a family<U+2014>'''Dasyatidae'''<U+2014>of [[batoidea|rays]], [[cartilaginous fish]]es related to [[shark]]s. They are common in coastal [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] marine waters throughout the world, but the family also includes species found in warmer [[temperate]] oceans such as ''[[Thorntail stingray|Dasyatis thetidis]]'', and species entirely restricted to [[fresh water]] such as ''[[Mekong freshwater stingray|D. laosensis]]'' and ''[[Freshwater whipray|Himantura chaophraya]]''. With the exception of ''[[Pelagic stingray|Pteroplatytrygon violacea]]'', all dasyatids are [[Demersal fish|demersal]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/descript/pelagicstingray/pelagicstingray.html | title = Pelagic Stingray | author = Bester, C., H. F. Mollett, & J. Bourdon | publisher = ''[[Florida Museum of Natural History]], Ichthyology department''}}</ref>

They are named after the barbed [[stinger]] (actually a modified [[dermal denticle]]) on their tail, which is used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length of approximately 35&nbsp;cm, and its underside has two grooves with [[venom]] [[gland]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fishchannel.com/media/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/july-2008/venom2.aspx.pdf | title = Dangerous and Venomous Aquarium Fish | author = Ternay, A. | publisher = ''fishchannel.com'' }}</ref> The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Meyer, P. | title = Stingray injuries | journal = Wilderness Environ Med | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 24<U+2013>8 | year = 1997 | pmid = 11990133}}</ref>  Some species have several stingers, and a few, notably ''[[Porcupine ray|Urogymnus asperrimus]]'', lack a sting entirely.<ref name=fishbaseUrogymnus>{{fishbase species |genus=Urogymnus |species=asperrimus |month=September |year=2009}}</ref>

Other types of rays also referred to as stingrays are the [[river stingray]]s (family [[Potamotrygonidae]]), the [[round ray|round stingrays]] (families [[Urolophidae]] and [[Urotrygonidae]]), the [[sixgill stingray]] (family [[Hexatrygonidae]]), and the [[deepwater stingray]] (family [[Plesiobatidae]]). For clarity, the members of the family Dasyatidae are sometimes called whip-tail stingrays.<ref>{{cite book |author= Debelius, H. | year= 1993 | title= Indian Ocean Tropical Fish Guide |publisher= Aquaprint Verlags GmbH|ISBN= 3-927991-01-5}}</ref>

While most dasyatids are relatively widespread and not currently [[threatened species|threatened]], there are several species (for example ''[[Blotched fantail ray|Taeniura meyeni]]'', ''[[Colares stingray|D. colarensis]]'', ''[[Niger stingray|D. garouaensis]]'', and ''D. laosensis'') where the conservation status is more problematic, leading to them being listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] by [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]. The status of several other species are poorly known, leading to them being listed as [[Data Deficient]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/ | title = IUCN Red List | publisher = ''[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'' }}</ref>



===Feeding===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Stingray under.jpg|thumb|right|A stingray's underside showing its mouth and the double row of [[gill]] openings. The pair of [[clasper]]s (at the base of the tail) identifies it as male.]]
The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to effectively conceal themselves in their environment. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey; instead, they use smell and electro-receptors ([[ampullae of Lorenzini]]) similar to those of [[shark]]s. Stingrays feed primarily on [[mollusca|mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tail visible. [[Coral reef]]s are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.

===Reproduction===
When a male is courting a female, he will follow her closely, biting at her pectoral disc. He then places one of his two claspers into her valve. 

Stingrays are [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], bearing live young in "litters" of five to thirteen. The female holds the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a [[yolk sac]], and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine "milk".<ref>[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/AtlanticStingray/AtlanticStingray.html Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department: Atlantic Stingray<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Stingray injuries==
{{Main|Stingray injury}}
[[Image:Stringray's sting.jpg|thumb|left|A stingray's stinger (ruler in cm)]]
Stingrays do not aggressively attack humans, and stings usually occur when a ray is accidentally stepped on.<ref name="Slaughter">{{cite journal |author=Slaughter RJ, Beasley DM, Lambie BS, Schep LJ |title=New Zealand's venomous creatures |journal=[[N Z Med J]]|volume=122 |issue=1290 |pages=83<U+2013>97 |year=2009 |pmid=19319171}}</ref> Shuffling or stamping one's feet while wading through shallow water may cause stingrays to swim away.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Contact with the stinger causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, muscle cramps from the venom, and possibly infection from bacteria later. The injury is very painful, but seldom life-threatening unless the stinger pierces a vital area.<ref name="Slaughter"/> The barb usually breaks off in the wound, and surgery may be required to remove the fragments.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flint D, Sugrue W | title = Stingray injuries: a lesson in debridement | journal = N Z Med J | volume = 112 | issue = 1086 | pages = 137<U+2013>8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10340692 }}</ref> A notable fatality is that of wildlife adventurer and television personality [[Steve Irwin]].

==As food==
[[Image:BBQ stingray.jpg|thumb|Barbecued stingray is commonly served in Singapore and Malaysia.]]
Rays are edible, and may also be caught as food by fishing lines or spears. Stingray recipes abound throughout the world, with dried forms of the wings being most common. For example, in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], stingray is commonly [[barbecue]]d over charcoal, then served with spicy ''[[sambal]]'' sauce. Generally, the most prized parts of the stingray are the wings (flaps is the proper terminology), the "cheek" (the area surrounding the eyes), and the liver. The rest of the ray is considered too rubbery to have any culinary uses.

While not independently valuable as a food source, the stingray's capacity to damage shell fishing grounds can lead to bounties being placed on their removal.

==Eco-tourism==
[[Image:Stingray Ctiy, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|left|Stingray City in Grand Cayman allows swimmers, snorkelers, and divers to swim with and feed the stingrays.]]
Stingrays are usually very docile and curious, their usual reaction being to flee any disturbance, but will sometimes brush their fins past any new object they come across.  Nevertheless, certain larger species may be more aggressive and should be approached with caution, as the stingray's defensive reflex (use of its poisoned stinger) may result in serious injury or death, as with the case of famed animal entertainer [[Steve Irwin]], who was fatally stabbed by a stingray.<ref>^ a  b  c  "Croc Hunter Irwin killed by stingray". The Age. 4 September 2006. http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Croc-Hunter-Steve-Irwin-died-instantly/2006/09/04/1157222051588.html. Retrieved 2010-08-11.</ref>

Dasyatids are not normally visible to swimmers, but divers and snorkelers may find them in shallow sandy waters, more so when the water is warm. In the [[Cayman Islands]] there are several dive sites called [[Stingray City, Grand Cayman]], where divers and snorkelers can swim with large [[southern stingray]]s (''D. americana'') and feed them by hand. There is also a "Stingray City" in the sea surrounding the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Antigua]]. It consists of a large, shallow reserve where the rays live, and snorkeling is possible, since the rays are used to the presence of humans.

In [[Belize]] off the island of [[Ambergris Caye]] there is a popular marine sanctuary called [[Hol Chan Marine Reserve|Hol Chan]]. Here, divers and snorkelers often gather to watch stingrays and [[nurse shark]]s that are drawn to the area by tour operators who feed the animals.

Many [[Tahiti]]an island resorts regularly offer guests the chance to "feed the stingrays and sharks". This consists of taking a boat to the outer lagoon reefs then standing in waist-high water while habituated stingrays swarm around, pressing right up against tourists seeking food from their hands or that being tossed into the water. The boat owners also "call in" sharks which, when they arrive from the ocean, swoop through the shallow water above the reef and snatch food offered to them.

== Other uses ==
The skin of the ray (''same'' in [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]) is used as an under layer for the cord or leather wrap (known as ''ito'' in [[Japanese Language|Japanese]]) on [[Katana|Japanese swords]] due to its hard, rough, texture that keeps the braided wrap from sliding on the handle during use. They are also used to make exotic shoes. They are used to make boots, belts, wallets, jackets, and even cellphone cases.<ref>[http://chioky.deviantart.com/art/Swordmaking-Anatomy-Katana-95862219 Swordmaking Anatomy.]</ref>

Several ethnological sections in museums{{Which?|date=January 2010}} such as the [[British Museum]] display arrowheads and spearheads made of stingray stingers, used in [[Micronesia]] and elsewhere. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[Henry de Monfreid]] states in his books that before [[World War II]], in the [[Horn of Africa]], [[whip]]s were made from the tail of big stingrays, and that this device inflicted cruel cuts, so in [[Aden]] the British forbid its use on women and slaves. In former Spanish colonies a stingray is called ''raya l<U+00E0>tigo'' ("whip ray"). {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Monfreid also writes in several places about men of his crew suffering stingray wounds while stranding and wading into [[Red Sea]] shallows to load or unload smuggled wares: he wrote that to "save the man's life" searing the wound with a red-hot iron was necessary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Fossils ==
[[Image:Stingray fossil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oligocene]] fossil stingray ''Heliobatis radians'']]
Although stingray [[teeth]] are rare on [[seafloor|sea bottoms]] compared to the similar [[shark teeth]], [[scuba diver]]s searching for the latter do encounter the teeth of stingrays.  [[Permineralization|Permineralized]] stingray teeth have been found in [[sedimentary]] deposits around the world, including [[fossil collecting|fossiliferous]] outcrops in [[Morocco]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
