'''No. 78 Squadron''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) fighter squadron of [[World War II]]. The Squadron was formed in July 1943, and took part in the [[New Britain campaign]] and [[New Guinea Campaign]] from November 1943 until September 1944 as part of the RAAF's mobile striking force. It attacked Japanese positions and shipping in the eastern [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]] during late 1944 and early 1945, and took part in the [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo Campaign]] during the last weeks of the war. The squadron was reduced to a cadre after it returned to Australia in December 1945, but received new aircraft and undertook training exercises until being disbanded in April 1948.

==History==
No. 78 Squadron was formed at [[Camden, New South Wales]], on 20 July 1943. The squadron began to receive its [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters from 2 August, and conducted training with these aircraft until early October.<ref name="RAAF_HS_63">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 63</ref> The squadron began moving from Camden to [[Woodlark Island]] in the war zone off New Guinea on 12 October 1943. However, its destination was changed to [[Kiriwina]], and the squadron became operational there as part of [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No. 73 Wing]] on 27 November.<ref name=RAAF_HS_63 /><ref name="Eather_91">Eather (1995), p. 91</ref> This wing formed part of [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|No. 10 (Operational) Group]], a mobile unit which had been established on 13 November to support the planned Allied advance along the north coast of New Guinea.<ref>Odgers (1968), pp. 182<U+2013>184</ref>

During late November and December 1943 No. 78 Squadron participated in attacks against Japanese positions in [[New Britain]] alongside [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|No. 76]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No. 77 Squadrons]], which were also equipped with Kittyhawks. In addition to bombing and strafing Japanese positions, the three squadrons also escorted RAAF and [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) bombers on several occasions.<ref>RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 63<U+2013>64</ref>

No. 78 Squadron moved to [[Nadzab]] on the mainland of New Guinea in January 1944. This redeployment was completed on the 12th of the month, and the squadron began operations as part of [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No. 78 Wing]] the next day. Many of the ground attack and escort sorties undertaken by No. 78 Squadron during January supported the [[Australian Army]] forces engaged in the [[Finisterre Range campaign]].<ref name="RAAF_HS_64">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 64</ref> The squadron was mainly used to escort Australian and USAAF bomber and transport aircraft in February and early March, but it also conducted a small number of ground attack sorties.<ref name=RAAF_HS_64 /> These escort duties were unpopular among No. 78 Wing's fighter pilots, but were a requirement for all fighter units which had recently arrived in New Guinea.<ref>Odgers (1968), p. 190</ref> The squadron moved to [[Cape Gloucester]] in New Britain during March 1944, becoming operational there late in the month. During the last week of March No. 78 Squadron and the other units of No. 78 Wing attacked Japanese positions in New Britain and nearby [[Garove]] island in co-operation with [[United States Navy]] [[PT boat]]s.<ref name="RAAF_HS_65">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 65</ref> However, on 27 March four No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks attacked and sank two American patrol boats, killing seven sailors and wounding five more. The inquiry conducted after this incident found that the pilots had not been informed that friendly ships were in the area.<ref>Odgers (1968), p. 201</ref>

The squadron moved again to [[Tadji Airport|Tadji airstrip]] on the mainland of New Guinea during April, from where it mainly flew patrols over the American beachhead at [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] commencing on 25 April. No. 78 Squadron continued to fly defensive patrols over Hollandia and Tadji during early May. On 15 May the unit moved to an airfield near Hollandia from where it escorted USAAF bombers and formed part of the force which protected the US Army landings at [[Battle of Wakde|Wakde]] on 17 May and [[Battle of Biak|Biak]] on the 27th of the month.<ref name=RAAF_HS_65 /> Overall, the squadron flew 601 sorties during May.<ref name="Odgers_227">Odgers (1968), p. 227</ref> On 3 June, 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron intercepted a group of 12 [[Nakajima Ki-43]] fighters and two three [[Nakajima B5N]] bombers near Biak. The Australian airmen downed five Ki-43s and two B5Ns for the loss of one Kittyhawk and its pilot.<ref>RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 65<U+2013>66</ref><ref name="Eather_92">Eather (1995), p. 92</ref> This was the last major air battle fought by the RAAF during the Pacific War.<ref name=Eather_92 /> The squadron also achieved the RAAF's last aerial victory of the New Guinea Campaign on 10 June, when one of its Kittyhawks shot down a [[Kawasaki Ki-61]] fighter near [[Yapen|Japen Island]].<ref name="RAAF_HS_66">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 66</ref> No. 78 Squadron continued to fly defensive patrols over Hollandia until 20 July, when it was redeployed to [[Numfor|Noemfoor]] island.<ref name=RAAF_HS_66 />

From 21 July, No. 78 Squadron supported the US military's offensive through western New Guinea. The squadron again operated with US Navy PT boats during strikes on Japanese positions, and flew patrols over the US Army beachhead at [[Sansapor Airfield|Sansapor]] for the first three weeks of August. From September to December, No. 78 Squadron conducted a series of raids on airfields in western New Guinea and operated against Japanese shipping in the easternmost islands of the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI). These operations were undertaken to support the [[Philippines Campaign (1944<U+2013>1945)|American landings in the Philippines]], and often involved lengthy flights.<ref>RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> No. 10 (Operational) Group was redesignated the First Tactical Air Force on 25 October; at this time No. 78 Squadron remained part of No. 78 Wing alongside [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No. 75]] and [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|No. 80 Squadrons]].<ref>Odgers (1968), pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> No. 78 Squadron aircraft began staging through airfields on [[Morotai]] from early December, and the squadron moved to the island between 21 December and January 1945.<ref name="RAAF_HS_67">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 67</ref> During November [[Len Waters]], the only known [[Indigenous Australian]] fighter pilot of World War II, was posted to No. 78 Squadron. He remained with the unit until the end of the war and completed 95 combat sorties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Magic|url=http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/lastbattles/lenwaters.html|work=Australia's War 1939-1945|publisher=Department of Veterans' Affairs|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Biographies|url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/collections/exhibitions/iaaw/biographys.html|work=Indigenous Australians at War|publisher=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>  

No. 78 Squadron continued to attack Japanese positions in the eastern NEI from Morotai. The squadron flew 267 sorties in January during which its aircraft fired 77,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition and dropped {{convert|153630|lb|kg}} of bombs. Fewer sorties were flown during February and March, and on 10 April No. 78 Squadron ceased operations from Morotai in order to prepare to take part in the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]], an island off the east coast of Borneo. While the main echelon of the squadron disembarked at Tarakan on 6 May, it took much longer than had been anticipated to repair the island's airfield, and No. 78 Squadron was unable to recommence flying operations until 18 July. During this time the squadron's ground crew worked with Australian Army engineers to build roads, and some members of the unit spent time on the front line.<ref name=RAAF_HS_67 />

From 20 July until the end of the war No. 78 Squadron operated over Borneo to support the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|invasion of Balikpapan]].<ref>Odgers (1968), p. 483</ref> The first strike was flown against Japanese positions in the [[Sandakan]] area, and on 24 July aircraft from No. 75, No. 78 and No. 80 Squadrons attacked airfields near [[Banjarmasin]].<ref name=RAAF_HS_67 /> The squadron conducted its final combat operation on 9 August, and was still based at Tarakan at the time the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on the 15th of the month.<ref name=Eather_92 /><ref name=RAAF_HS_67 /> No. 78 Squadron had suffered 12 fatalities during the war.<ref name=AWM_78Sqn>{{cite web|title=78 Squadron RAAF|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11107second_world_war.asp|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> Following the armistice the squadron undertook leaflet dropping and reconnaissance sorties until November, when the Kittyhawks were flown to Australia. The remainder of the unit's personnel arrived at Sydney on 12 December 1945 on board the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}}.<ref name=RAAF_HS_67 /> 

After returning to Australia, No. 78 Squadron moved to [[Deniliquin]] in New South Wales on 17 December. It was rapidly reduced to a cadre, and comprised only 17 personnel in July 1946.<ref name="RAAF_HS_68">RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 68</ref> The unit was located at [[RAAF Station Schofields]] near Sydney from May to August 1946, and then moved to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]] outside of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].<ref name=Eather_92 /> On 4 August 1946 it received four [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51D Mustang]] fighters and a single [[CAC Wirraway]] trainer. No. 78 Squadron undertook training during 1947, including exercises with warships in March and July. The unit was disbanded on 1 April 1948.<ref name=RAAF_HS_68 />
