'''Hans Rudolf "Ruedi" Giger''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|<U+0261>|i<U+02D0>|<U+0261>|<U+0259>r}}; born February 5, 1940) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[surrealist]] painter, sculptor, and set designer. He won an [[Academy Award]] for Best Achievement for Visual Effects for his design work on the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.<ref name=Guardian>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/apr/29/onlocationfilminspiredtravel.switzerland.travelfoodanddrink Out of this world], by Samantha Warwick, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 April 2006.

==Life and career==
Giger was born in [[Chur]], [[Graub<U+00FC>nden]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]], [[Switzerland]], the son of a chemist. He spoke of a father who viewed art as a "breadless profession", and strongly encouraged his son to enter into pharmaceutics. Despite this, in 1962, he moved to [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], where he studied Architecture and [[industrial design]] at the School of Applied Arts until 1970.<ref name="Arh+">Hans Ruedi Giger, ''HR Giger ARh+'', tr. Karen Williams, Taschen, 1993, ISBN 978-3-8228-9642-6</ref> Giger had a relationship with Swiss actress [[Li Tobler]] until she committed suicide in 1975. He married Mia Bonzanigo in 1979; they separated a year and a half later.

Giger's style and thematic execution have been influential. His design for the [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]] was inspired by his painting ''[[Necronom IV]]'' and earned him an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1980. His books of paintings, particularly ''[[Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)|Necronomicon]]'' and ''Necronomicon II'' (1985) and the frequent appearance of his art in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine continued his rise to international prominence.<ref name="Arh+"/> Giger is also well known for artwork on several records.

In 1998 Giger acquired the Ch<U+00E2>teau St. Germain in [[Gruy<U+00E8>res]], Switzerland, and it now houses the H. R. Giger Museum, a permanent repository of his work.<ref>Gary Singh, "Giger Harvest", Silicon Alleys, ''Metro Silicon Valley'', July 8<U+2013>14, 2009, p. 8</ref>

==Style==
[[Image:Birth Machine.jpg|thumbnail|''Birth Machine'' sculpture in Gruy<U+00E8>res]]
Giger got his start with small ink drawings before progressing to oil paintings. For most of his career, Giger has worked predominantly in [[airbrush]], creating monochromatic canvasses depicting [[surrealism|surreal]], [[nightmare|nightmarish]] dreamscapes. However, he has now largely abandoned large airbrush works in favor of works with pastels, markers or ink.<ref name="Arh+"/>

His most distinctive stylistic innovation is that of a representation of human bodies and machines in a cold, [[cyborg|interconnected relationship]], described as "[[biomechanical art|biomechanical]]". His paintings often display [[fetishistic]] sexual imagery{{clarify|date=November 2011}}{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}. His main influences were painters [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]] and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]]. He met Salvador Dal<U+00ED>, to whom he was introduced by painter [[Robert Venosa]]. He was also a personal friend of [[Timothy Leary]]. Giger suffers from [[night terror]]s and his paintings are all to some extent inspired by his experiences with that particular [[sleep disorder]]. He studied interior and industrial design at the School of Commercial Art in Zurich (from 1962 to 1965) and made his first paintings as a means of [[art therapy]].<ref name="Arh+"/>

In 2007, Giger and his work were subjects of a 19-minute documentary, ''H.R. Giger's Sanctuary'', which toured internationally and was released on DVD in May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=19130&FID=31 |title=H.R.

==Other works==

[[File:Giger gitarren.jpg|right|thumb|Ibanez H. R. Giger signature guitar]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Giger directed a number of films, including ''Swiss Made'' (1968), ''Tagtraum'' (1973), ''Giger's Necronomicon'' (1975) and ''Giger's Alien'' (1979).

Giger has created furniture designs, particularly the [[Harkonnen Capo Chair]] for a movie of the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' that was to be directed by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. Many years later, [[David Lynch]] directed the film, using only rough concepts by Giger. Giger had wished to work with Lynch,<ref>Sheldon Teitelbaum, "Giger's Necronomicon Imagery Comes Alive on the Screen", ''Cinefantastique'' vol. 18 no. 4, May 1988, http://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/Cinefantastique_18_04.pdf p. 13 (PDF) viewed July 9, 2009</ref> as he states in one of his books that Lynch's film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' was closer than even Giger's own films to realizing his vision.<ref name="Arh+"/>

Giger has applied his biomechanical style to interior design. One "[[Giger Bar]]" sprang up in [[Tokyo]], but the realization of his designs were a great disappointment to the artist, since the Japanese organization behind the venture did not wait for his final designs, but decided to barrel ahead with nothing more than Giger's rough preliminary sketches. For that reason, Giger disowned the Tokyo Giger Bar and never set foot in the place. Within a few years, the establishment was out of business.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The two Giger Bars in his native Switzerland (in Gruy<U+00E8>res and Chur), however, were built under Giger's close personal supervision and reflect his original concepts for them accurately. At [[The Limelight]] in Manhattan, Giger's artwork was licensed to decorate the VIP room, the uppermost chapel of the landmarked church, but it was never intended to be a permanent installation and bore no similarity to the real Giger Bars in Switzerland. The arrangement was terminated after two years when the Limelight closed its doors.<ref>Frank X. Owen, ''Clubland: The Fabulous Rise and Murderous Fall of Club Culture'', New York: St. Martin's, 2003, p. 269.</ref> As of 2009 only the two authentic Swiss Giger Bars remain. 

His art has greatly influenced [[tattoo]]ists and [[List of fetish artists|fetishists]] worldwide. Under a licensing deal [[Ibanez]] guitars released an H. R. Giger signature series: the Ibanez ICHRG2, an Ibanez [[Iceman (guitar)|Iceman]], features "NY City VI", the Ibanez RGTHRG1 has "NY City XI" printed on it, the S Series SHRG1Z has a metal-coated engraving of "Biomechanical Matrix" on it, and a 4-string SRX bass, SRXHRG1, has "N.Y. City X" on it.<ref name="Arh+"/>

Giger is often referred to in [[pop culture]], especially in [[science fiction]] and [[cyberpunk]]. [[William Gibson]] (who wrote an early script for ''[[Alien 3]]'') seems particularly fascinated: a minor character in ''[[Virtual Light]]'', Lowell, is described as having ''New York XXIV'' [[tattooed]] across his back, and in ''[[Idoru]]'' a secondary character, [[Shinya Yamazaki|Yamazaki]], describes the buildings of [[nanotech]] [[Japan]] as Giger-esque.
