'''Djibouti women's national football team''' represents the country in international competitions. Women's football was formally organised in the country in 2002, and a national team was created.  There are no youth national teams.  The country has only played in one FIFA recognised match, which they lost.  They are unranked.

==Background and history==
[[File:Soccer in Djibouti.jpg|left|thumb|An American female serviceman plays football with an boy in Djibouti]]
The country became independent in 1977.<ref name=paper-book-1999>{{cite book|title=The dictionary of football : the complete A-Z of international football from Ajax to Zinedine Zidane|first1=John|last1=Ballard|first2=Paul|last2=Suff|location=London|publisher=Boxtree|date=1999|isbn=0752224344|oclc=59442612|page=181}}</ref> 

Women's football development in Africa has to deal with several challenges that impact the ability to develop a high level of play, including  limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses.<ref name="Williams2007-186">{{cite book|author=Jean Williams|title=A Beautiful Game: International Perspectives on Women's Football|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VuIp04RvKX8C&pg=PA157|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=15 December 2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-674-1|page=186}}</ref>  When high level women's players are developed, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe or the United States.<ref name="Kuhn2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Kuhn|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwmsLxiWvnwC&pg=PA34|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=24 February 2011|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-60486-053-5|page=34}}</ref>  Another issue facing women's football in Africa is that most of the money for the game does not come from national football federations but instead from [[FIFA]].<ref name="Kuhn2011">{{cite book|author=Gabriel Kuhn|title=Soccer Vs. the State: Tackling Football and Radical Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BwmsLxiWvnwC&pg=PA34|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=24 February 2011|publisher=PM Press|isbn=978-1-60486-053-5|page=34}}</ref>

In 1985, almost no country in the world had a women's national football team.<ref name="McDougall2012">{{cite book|author=Chr<U+00F6>s McDougall|title=Soccer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2nrhG5ovUSQC&pg=PA45|accessdate=13 April 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61783-146-1|page=45}}</ref> Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then,  only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country.  There is a regional and national women's competition,<ref name=goalsprogram4/> which was established in 2007.  The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football.<ref name=goalkeeperkadan/>  The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams.<ref name=goalsprogram4/><ref name=fifabook>{{cite journal|coauthors=FIFA|title=Women's Football Today|year=2006|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/women/93/77/21/factsheets.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref>  12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal.  This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football.<ref name=goalsprogram2>{{cite web|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=FIFA|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/goalproject/dji_eng.pdf|date=21 April 2009|page=2|title=Goal!

In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country.  In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.<ref name=goalsprogram4>{{cite web|accessdate=16 April 2012|publisher=FIFA|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/goalproject/dji_eng.pdf|date=21 April 2009|page=4|title=Goal!
