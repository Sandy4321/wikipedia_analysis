The only Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights currently in place in America took effect in New York state on Novemeber 29, 2010.  This law protects the rights of domestic workers by defining their legal rights as an employee.  California is currently processing a similar Bill of Rights.

==Background==

[[The National Labor Relations Act]] was enacted in 1935 by Congress.  This law was created to protect the rights of workers in the United States.  The act did not cover domestic workers, as well as a number of other employees.<ref>{{cite news

Therefore, a six year grassroots campaign was put into effect until the Governor of New York passed the Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights.<ref>{{cite news

==New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights==
Under the New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, a domestic worker is defined as someone who works in another person's home who is not related to them and is not a part time job.  This bill gives domestic workers an eight hour work day and overtime (time and a half) for working over 40 hours a week (or 44 hours if the employee resides in the home of their employer).  This law also establishes that workers must be granted one day off (24 hours) every seven days of work or overtime pay if the employee agrees to work on this day.  Also, after one year of work with the same employer, domestic workers are granted three paid days off every year.  Although domestic workers were already covered by the minimum wage law, this bill enforces that domestic workers music recieve $7.25 per hour.  Employers must pay their workers weekly or deduct money from the employee's paycheck without written permission. Employers must now keep a payroll and provide workers with written notifications regrading sick days, vacation days, and work schedules. Domestic workers who work at least 40 hours a week are now entitled to Workers' Compenstation Insurance and Disability Benifits.  This law also gives domestic workers coverage under the New York State Human Rights Law if they have been harassed due to gender, race, sex, religion, or origin.  The employer cannot make any unwanted sexual advances including both physical and verbal sexual actions.  If the worker files a complaint, the employer cannot retaliate.  This law covers all full time workers, including immigrants.  This law does not cover people who are related to the person they care for, or if they are a part time worker, such as a baby-sitter.<ref>{{cite news

==California Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights==
California is currently under an ongoing debate of passing the California Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights (CDWBR), or AB 889.  The California Domestic Bill of Rights seeks to provide domestic workers with overtime pay, worker's compensation, the right to 8 hours of uninterupped sleep, and the right to cook their own food.<ref>{{cite news
