The '''Waikato River''' is the longest [[river]] in [[New Zealand]].  In the [[North Island]], it runs for 425 [[kilometre]]s from the eastern slopes of [[Mount Ruapehu]], joining the [[Tongariro River]] system and emptying into [[Lake Taupo]], New Zealand's largest [[lake]]. It drains Taupo at the lake's northeastern edge, creates the [[Huka Falls]], then flows [[Cardinal direction|northwest]], through the [[Waikato Plains]]. It empties into the [[Tasman Sea]] south of [[Auckland]] at [[Port Waikato]]. It gives its name to the [[Waikato]] region that surrounds the Waikato Plains.

The river's main tributary is the [[Waipa River]], which has its confluence with the Waikato at [[Ngaruawahia]]. 

The name ''Waikato'' comes from [[M<U+0101>ori language|M<U+0101>ori]] and translates as ''flowing [[water]]''.   

The Waikato River has [[Spirituality|spiritual]] meaning for various local [[M<U+0101>ori]] [[tribe]]s including the large [[Tainui]], who regard it as a source of their [[mana]] or pride. The widely-respected [[marae]] of [[Turangawaewae]] is close to its banks at Ngaruawahia.  

For many years Tainui tribe have sought to re-establish their links to the river after the [[New Zealand land wars]] (see [[Invasion of Waikato]]) and the subsequent confiscations of the 1860s, and are continuing negotiations with the current [[New Zealand government]]. The deed of settlement signed by the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in August 2008 settled the Raupatu claim to the Waikato River, although other claims for land blocks and harbours are still outstanding.Waikato-Tainui now have joint management of the river with Environment Waikato.

== Course ==
The river starts as many small streams on the eastern side of Mount Ruapehu. The [[Mangatoetoenui Glacier]] (once called the Waikato glacier) is one of the principal sources.<ref>{{cite book|title=The River: The Story of the Waikato|last=Miles|first=Sue|isbn=0-86863-418-2|year=1984|page=1}}</ref> The southernmost tributary is called the Upper Waikato Stream. The [[Waipakihi River]] joins the Waikato from the [[Kaimanawa Mountains]] to the west. At the point the river meets the Waihohonu Stream, it becomes called the Tongariro River. The [[Pouto River]] joins from [[Lake Rotoaira]] to the east. The Tongariro flows northward, with [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] in parallel, through the town of [[Turangi]], and into the southern side of Lake Taupo.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reed New Zealand Atlas|year=2004|isbn=0-7900-0952-8|author=Peter Dowling (editor)|publisher=Reed Books|pages=map 38}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Geographic Atlas of New Zealand|year=2005|isbn=1-877333-20-4|author=Roger Smith, GeographX|publisher=Robbie Burton|pages=map 89}}</ref> Extensive engineering of lakes, tunnels and canals are used to generate hydroelectric power in the [[Tongariro Power Scheme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/index.cfm?125A7AB6-16C3-D74B-FDE0-BA48691C950B|title=Tongariro Power Scheme|publisher=[[Genesis Energy]]|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref>

At the northeast point of Lake Taupo is [[Tapuaeharuru Bay]] and the town of [[Taupo]]. The Waikato River leaves the lake and flows northeast past the town, alongside State Highway 1, to the [[Huka Falls]]. [[New Zealand State Highway 5|State Highway 5]] runs more or less parallel to the river as it flows further northeast. About 40&nbsp;km from the lake, the river flows west and into the southern end of [[Lake Ohakuri]]. It exits from the northwest end of that lake and flows west through the small [[Lake Atiamuri]] and into the long east-west oriented [[Lake Whakamaru]], with [[New Zealand State Highway 30|State Highway 30]] following its course. It passes northwest through [[Lake Maraetai]] and [[Lake Waipapa]], where it is joined by the [[Waipapa River]], then north through [[Lake Arapuni]] and into [[Lake Karapiro]]. Pokaiwhenua Stream joins the river in Lake Karapiro.<ref>Reed New Zealand Atlas, 2004, maps 28-29, 19</ref><ref>The Geographic Atlas of New Zealand, 2005, maps 78, 66-68, 56</ref> Nine hydroelectric power stations at eight dams extract energy from the river between Taupo and Karapiro. All the lakes in this stretch of the river (apart from Lake Taupo) are artificial.<ref>Miles, 1984, p 62</ref>

Northwest of Lake Karapiro, the river forms the Waikato Basin,<ref>Miles, 1984, p 69</ref> flowing through the towns of [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], and [[Ngaruawahia]]. It is joined by its largest tributary, the [[Waipa River]], at Ngaruawahia. It then flows north through the Taupiri Gorge<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/G/GeologyLandDistrictsOfNewZealand/SouthAucklandLandDistrict/en|title=South Auckland Land District|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966)]]}}</ref> to enter the lower Waikato region.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WaikatoRiver/WaikatoRiver/en|title=Waikato River|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966)]]}}</ref> Further north is [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]] and then [[Meremere]], where the [[Whangamarino River|Whangamarino]] and [[Maramarua River|Maramarua]] Rivers join it. From [[Mercer, New Zealand|Mercer]], where the [[Mangatawhiri River]] joins it, the Waikato flows west and southwest. Just before its mouth at [[Port Waikato]], the [[Araroa River]] joins from the north.<ref>Reed New Zealand Atlas, 2004, maps 14, 18-19</ref>

== Uses of the river ==
As well as being a water and [[recreation]] resource, the river has long been a critical communications and transport link for the communities along it. [[Taupo]], [[Mangakino]], [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Horotiu]], [[Ngaruawahia]], [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Hampton Downs]], [[Meremere]], [[Waiuku]] and Port Waikato are on or close to it.   

The river was of [[military]] significance in the land wars between [[British Army|British]] and M<U+0101>ori soldiers around 1863, and significant [[battle]]s were fought. In support of these wars, New Zealand developed its first "navy", the [[Early naval vessels of New Zealand#Waikato Flotilla|Waikato Flotilla]]. A [[cemetery]] containing the [[grave (burial)|grave]]s of the British military dead can be found at [[Rangiriri]] opposite the [[hotel]], [[retailing|shop]]s and [[cafe]].   

A [[ferry]] service along part of its length was for years conducted by [[Cesar Roose]]<!-- who is Cesar Roose?-->, several of whose descendants still live beside it.

=== Electricity generation ===
{{See also|Electricity sector in New Zealand}}
The Waikato's first [[hydro-electric]] [[power station]] was the [[Horahora Power Station]], now located under the [http://www.siliconlakes.co.nz/horahora/photos/photo_5.html Horahora bridge] deep beneath the surface of [[Karapiro|Lake Karapiro]]. Horahora was built to supply [[electricity]] for the [[Martha gold mines]] at [[Waihi]].<ref name="NZHA88">''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); [[David Bateman]], 1997, Plate 88</ref>

The river has a series of eight dams and nine hydroelectric power stations that generate electricity for the national grid.  These were constructed between 1929 and 1971 to meet growing demand for electricity.

The power scheme begins at Lake Taupo, which has control gates to regulate the flow of water into the river. Once released through the gates it takes nearly 18 [[hour]]s for the water to flow to the Tasman Sea. On its journey downstream it passes through power stations at [[Aratiatia Power Station|Aratiatia]], [[Ohakuri Power Station|Ohakuri]], [[Atiamuri Power Station|Atiamuri]], [[Whakamaru Power Station|Whakamaru]], [[Maraetai Power Station|Maraetai]], [[Waipapa]], [[Arapuni Power Station|Arapuni]] and [[Karapiro Power Station|Karapiro]].

Approximately 4000 [[Watt-hour|gigawatt hours]] (GWh) of electricity is generated annually by the scheme, which is around 13% of New Zealand's total electrical generating capacity.

The river also provides cooling water for the [[coal]]/[[natural gas]] fired [[thermal power station]] at [[Huntly Power Station|Huntly]]. However, in order to protect aquatic life, conditions are imposed by its resource consent (see [[Resource Management Act]]), specifying the quantity of water that can be removed by the station along with the maximum temperature of the water when returned to the river (25<U+00B0>C). These conditions mean that on very hot summer days the station cannot operate at maximum capacity, sometimes reducing their total output to 40 [[megawatts]] (MW). A new [[cooling tower]] has been built as part of expansion works at the site, which allows one 250 MW unit to run at full load even during such times.<ref>[http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/generation/our-thermal-plants/en/our-thermal-plants_home.cfm Our Thermal Plants] (from the [[Genesis Energy]] website)</ref>

=== Recreation ===

The Waikato is renowned among [[whitewater]] [[kayaking]] enthusiasts, specifically for the [[Full James rapid]] located north of Taupo. The Full James was the site of the 1999 [[World Whitewater Championships]], as well as the pre-World event the year before. The lower Waikato is also popular amongst duck shooters.

[[Lake Karapiro]] (an artificial lake) is regarded as one of New Zealand's best [[Sport rowing|rowing]] venues. The [[World Rowing Championships]] in 1978 and [[2010 World Rowing Championships|2010]], and the [[1950 British Empire Games]] were hosted at Karapiro.

Close to Hamilton there are several hazards boat uses should be aware of:
#At the confluence of the Waipa and Waikato rivers there is a large build up of silt that extends about 30% of the way across the Waikato River from the South West bank. This is very shallow in summer and is a danger to craft with outboard motors.
#In mid stream by the Pukete Sewage treatment Station, there is a 200 mm wide vertical pipe. In usual summer conditions this stands 2 m above the water, but in winter it is almost covered and very difficult to see during fog that is common. This pipe is 100 m upriver from the Pukete double boat ramp, close to the Pukete Pa.
#500 m South of Cobham Bridge opposite the Malcolm St reserve, near the south bank, is an area of low rocks that extends 12m into the river. During mid summer the rocks are exposed 500 mm but in other seasons they are normally covered. They are marked by a single thin steel post 2m high.
#500 m upriver from the Airport (Narrows) Bridge the river narrows to pass through a narrow high banked gut. Rocky reefs extend out from each side, leaving an 8 m central channel in summer. The reef is exposed in normal summer condition but is hard to see because of the deep shadows cast by the 8 m high banks. The Narrows Recreation Camp is on the West bank.

==Ecology==
The Waikato River and its hydro lakes are home to at least 19 types of native fish, 10 types of introduced fish<ref>[http://www.ew.govt.nz/environmental-information/Rivers-lakes-and-wetlands/healthyrivers/Waikato-River/What-lives-in-the-Waikato-River/ "What lives in the Waikato River" Environment Waikato]</ref>. The introduced species include [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]] and [[brown trout]] providing what has been call "the finest fly-fishing in the world".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyboomersguide.co.nz/Articles/Travel/New+Zealand+Travel/A+Trip+down+the+Waikato+River.html |title=A Trip down the Waikato River |publisher=www.babyboomersguide.co.nz |accessdate=2010-02-09 }}</ref> Other introduced species include [[Common carp|carp]] and [[mosquitofish]] have become major pests.

== Environmental issues ==
The whole length of the river is administered by the Regional Council, or "[[Environment Waikato]]", based in Hamilton. Several major problems currently face the river. 

The large [[Drainage basin|catchment]] area of the Waikato River is highly fertile farmland, so intensive agriculture is present. Due to the [[agricultural]] activity within the catchment significant [[agricultural pollution]] is [[Leaching (agriculture)|leached]] into groundwater and contained in the [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. The mismanagement of [[Fertilizer#Nitrogen_fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]] and [[effluent spreading]] practices in [[dairy farming]] is seen as the major causes of this pollution.

The removal of the native vegetation throughout the catchment to accommodate the increasing demand for farmland has also resulted in the [[silt]]ing-up of what was once a [[navigable channel]] in the river with loose [[soil]]s from [[eroded]] farmland.

[[Arsenic]] is also a major problem and in places the concentration reaches 0.035 grams of arsenic per cubic metre. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/Environmental-information/Rivers-lakes-and-wetlands/healthyrivers/Waikato-River/How-clean-is-the-Waikato-River/ |title=How clean is the Waikato River? |publisher=Environment Waikato|accessdate=2010-02-09 }}</ref>, greatly exceeding the [[WHO]] provisional guideline of 0.01 grams of arsenic per cubic metre.<ref>''Guidelines for drinking water quality'', Vol. 1, 3rd ed. - World Health Organization, (2006) </ref> The majority of arsenic in the Waikato River comes from the [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei Geothermal Power Station]]. The amount of arsenic gradually declines, as the river flows northwards and is at its lowest at the Waikato River Heads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/environmental-information/Rivers-lakes-and-wetlands/healthyrivers/Waikato-River/Downstream-change-to-water-quality/Changes-in-arsenic/ |title=Changes in arsenic |publisher=Environment Waikato |accessdate=2009-09-22 }}</ref>

75,000 [[Cumec|cumec]] of water, making 10% of Auckland's needs, is pumped from a point near the seaward end of the river down a 38&nbsp;km pipe north to [[Auckland]].  This is purified in a new treatment plant that meets New Zealand's 2000 drinking water standards according to Water Care NZ. This is equal to or better than the A standard for Auckland's existing water supplies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Slightly-modified [[human waste]]s are pumped into the river downriver of several [[town]]s. Hamilton city has one of the most modern water treatment systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This will meet the cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and .1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of bad tastes odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ  water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million. The largest stage -a new bioreactor/clarifier is due for completion in early 2010,according to the services website of the Hamilton City Council.

A further issue is industrial and metropolitan waste from early-established [[landfill]]s and waste-emitting [[factories]] on the banks of the river.     

These include an unlined waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose [[leachate]]s include [[persistent organic pollutant]]s such as [[dieldrin]] in quantities toxic to [[freshwater]] marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. Tribes at the northern point of the river who took legal action to oppose the continued operation of this dump spoke of finding many dead, disordered and distressed [[fish]] near their tribal lands.
