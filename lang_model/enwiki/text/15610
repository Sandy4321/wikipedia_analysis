'''Sir George Lowthian Trevelyan 4th Baronet''' (5 November 1906 <U+2013> 9 February 1996) was a British educational pioneer and a founding father of the [[New Age movement]]. After listening to a lecture by Dr [[Walter Stein]], a student of [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1942, he turned from being [[agnostic]] to new age spiritual thinker, and even studied [[anthroposophy]] in the coming years. He first became a History teacher at [[Gordonstoun]] School, a pioneering radical education methods. After the [[World War II]], he became the Warden at [[Attingham Park]], a pioneering adult education college in [[Shropshire]] in 1948, from where he retired in 1971, to found the [[Wrekin Trust]], an educational charity. He was subsequently associated with the [[Soil Association]], the [[Findhorn Foundation]], the [[Teilhard de Chardin]] Society and the Essene Network. In the last 15 years of his life he was the focus of many lecture tours and meetings. He also wrote numerous books, including ''A Vision of the Aquarian Age'' (1977), ''Operation Redemption'' (1981), ''Summons to a High Crusade'' (1985) and finally ''Exploration into God'' (1991). He was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]], in 1982.<ref name="rl"/><ref name="ind">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-sir-george-trevelyan-1321219.html|title=Obituary: Sir George Trevelyan|date=26 February 1996|work=The Independent|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Trevelyan was the eldest child of [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet]], and Mary Katherine Bell, a younger half-sister of [[Gertrude Bell]] and the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Bell, 2nd Baronet]]. He was proud of this ancestry which he imagined linked him to Sir Trevillian, one of [[King Arthur]]'s knights, who swam ashore on horseback when [[Lyonesse]] finally sank. Legend says that Sir Trevillian emerged with a mighty effort from the waves and landed safely on the dry land of [[Cornwall]]. He grew up in his family's [[Northumberland]] home, [[Wallington Hall]], which his father gave to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], effectively disinheriting Trevelyan.

In 1925, he went to read history at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], as per his family tradition.<ref name="ind"/> Whilst there he began his 42-year long association with the famous 'Trevelyan Man Hunt', an extraordinary annual event which involved a chase on foot over the wild Lakeland fells, with human 'hunters' hunting after human 'hares'. This energetic event was started in 1898 by Trevlyan's historian uncle [[G. M. Trevelyan]] and the Wynthrop Youngs, and still continues today, as a kind of hide and seek game without dogs or weapons.

==Career==
After leaving Cambridge, Trevelyan went on to teach at [[Gordonstoun]], which at that time was a school pioneering a radical education. Later, he became involved as a teacher of the [[Alexander Technique]] for postural integration, and apprenticed himself to a furniture designer and master craftsman in wood, [[Peter Waals]], working at Waals' workshop in the [[Cotswolds|Cotswold hills]]. Trevelyan himself made many fine pieces of furniture, including a bed in which he finally died, as he wished.

In 1931, Trevelyan took the first class [[F. Matthias Alexander]] gave for future teachers of the [[Alexander Technique]].

In 1942, after hearing a lecture given by Dr [[Walter Stein]], a student of [[Rudolf Steiner]], Trevelyan discovered a spiritual world-view. During his lifetime he explored beliefs in [[angel]]s, the calming effects of [[crystal]]s and the power of [[ley lines]], alongside organic farming and communal living. 

On retirement from the army, in 1948 he was appointed Warden and Principal of [[Attingham Park]], an adult training college in [[Shropshire]], where he carried out his pioneering work in the teaching of spiritual knowledge as [[adult education]]. The courses ranged from [[chamber music]] and drama to [[esoteric]] subjects such as 'Finding the Inner Teacher' and 'Holistic Vision', the latter attracting large numbers of participants, many of them from other countries as well as Britain. The college was jointly sponsored by the local authority and the [[University of Birmingham]], both of whom looked askance at Trevelyan's attraction towards the mystical; and so it took immense moral courage, for instance, for him to present a course on 'Death and Becoming', a subject that was in those days virtually [[taboo]].

He was involved in the establishment of the [[Findhorn Foundation]], the [[Gatekeeper Trust]], and through his friendship with [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]], the [[Chalice Well]] and the [[Lamplighter Movement]].

In 1971, he set up the [[Wrekin Trust]] to promote spiritual education and knowledge

In 1982, he was a recipient of the [[Right Livelihood Award]].<ref name="rl">{{cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/trevelyan.html|title=George Trevelyan (UK) (1982)|publisher=''[[Right Livelihood Award]]'' website|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>
==Personal life==
He married Helen Lindsay-Smith (died 1994) in 1940, and the couple had an adopted daughter.<ref name="ind"/>
