'''Return Jonathan Meigs, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|m|<U+025B>|<U+0261>|z}}; November 17, 1764{{spaced ndash}}March 29, 1825) was a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] politician from [[Ohio]]. He served as the [[List of Governors of Ohio|fourth Governor of Ohio]], fifth [[United States Postmaster General]], and as a [[United States Senator]].

==Early life==
Meigs was born in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], the son of [[Return J. Meigs, Sr.]] and the descendant of early [[Puritan]] settlers in [[Massachusetts]]. He graduated from [[Yale University|Yale College]] in 1785 and studied law there. In 1788, after being admitted to the bar in [[Connecticut]], he moved to [[Marietta, Ohio]], where his father had been one of the [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory|first settlers]], arriving earlier that year.<ref name=OHSbio>S. Winifred Smith, [http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/ohgovernment/governors/meigs.html Return J. Meigs, Jr.], Ohio Historical Society. Accessed January 10, 2011.</ref>

==Career==
In Marietta, Meigs was a [[lawyer]], [[storekeeper]] and [[farmer]], as well as serving in public offices. He was appointed the first court clerk for the court established at Marietta in 1788.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/ohgovernment/governors/meigs.html|title= Return J. Meigs, Jr.|publisher=Ohio Historical Society|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> When a [[post office]] was established in Marietta in 1794, he became its first [[postmaster]]. In 1798 he was named to a judgeship on the [[Northwest Territory]]'s territorial court, and in 1799 he won election to the territorial [[legislature]].<ref name=OHSbio/> 

In 1803 he was appointed the first Chief Justice of the [[Ohio State Supreme Court]].<ref>{{Ohio History Central|271|Return J. Meigs, Jr|accessdate= July 11, 1012}}</ref> He served in that position for a year before serving as a judge in the [[Louisiana Territory]] and [[Michigan Territory]]. He returned to Ohio in 1807 to run for governor. He won the election, but was declared ineligible for failing to meet the residency requirements. He then was appointed to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to finish the term of [[John Smith (Ohio Senator)|John Smith]] and was re-elected to his own term a year later. He resigned in late 1810 after winning the governorship. 

He served two two-year terms, resigning in April 1814 when appointed [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster general]] by [[James Madison|President Madison]]. His service as Postmaster General was not without controversy.  Congress investigated him twice, and he was cleared both times.  The size of the Post office doubled during his tenure, which implicated financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=75517&pg=1 |title=Moving & Sorting Equipment: Mailbag associated with Postmaster general Return J. Meigs, Jr. |first1=Allison |last1=Marsh |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref> He served until 1823, when he retired due to ill health and returned to Marietta. Meigs died in Marietta on March 29, 1825, and is buried in Marietta's [[Mound Cemetery (Marietta, Ohio)|Mound Cemetery]]. His grave is marked by a large monument.<ref name=OHSbio/>

==Family==
Meigs was married in 1788 to Sophia Wright. They had one child, a daughter.<ref name=OHSbio/> Return J. Meigs, Jr. did not have a direct male heir, but two of his younger brothers, John and Timothy, each named a son Return Jonathan Meigs. The first of these - called Return J. Meigs III - passed the bar in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], commenced law practice in [[Athens, Tennessee]], and became prominent in [[Tennessee]] state affairs before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He moved to Staten Island, New York, however, at the time of Tennessee's secession from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1861.<ref>[http://www.meigs.org/rjm368.htm Return Jonathan Meigs 3rd], Meigs Family Genealogy and History website</ref> Among those men who [[read law]] under his tutelage in Tennessee was [[William Parish Chilton]] who would become Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.

Timothy's son, Return J. Meigs IV, married Jennie Ross, daughter of principal Cherokee chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], and emigrated to [[Oklahoma]] on the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Emmet Starr (1922), ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ei0TAAAAYAAJ History of the Cherokee Indians and their legends and folk lore]''</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Meigs County, Ohio]] is named in his honor. ([[Meigs County, Tennessee]] is named for his father.) [[Fort Meigs]] in [[Perrysburg, Ohio]] was named in his honor during the [[War of 1812]] by [[William Henry Harrison]].<ref name=OHSbio/><ref>[http://www.ci.perrysburg.oh.us/HistoricPerrysburg/tabid/57/Default.aspx Historic Perrysburg], Perrysburg, Ohio website, accessed January 10, 2011</ref>
