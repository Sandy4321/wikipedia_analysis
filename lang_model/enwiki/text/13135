'''Reginald fitz Jocelin''' (sometimes '''Reginald Italus''', '''Richard the Lombard''', or '''Reginald Lombardus''') was a medieval [[Bishop of Bath]] and an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]-elect in [[England]]. A member of an Anglo-Norman noble family, he was the son of a [[bishop]], and was educated in Italy. He was a household clerk for [[Thomas Becket]], but by 1167 he was serving King [[Henry II of England]]. He was also a favorite of King [[Louis VII of France]], who had him appointed [[abbot]] of the [[Abbey of Corbeil]]. After angering Becket while attempting to help negotiate a settlement between Becket and the king, Becket then called Reginald "that offspring of fornication, that enemy to the peace of the Church, that traitor."<ref name=HenryIIquote>quoted in Warren ''Henry II'' p. 535</ref> When he was elected as a bishop, the election was challenged by the King Henry's eldest son, [[Henry the Young King]], and Reginald was forced to go to [[Rome]] to be confirmed by [[Pope Alexander III]] . He attended the [[Third Lateran Council]] in 1179, and spent much of his time administering his diocese. He was elected Archbishop of Canterbury in 1191, but died before he could be [[Consecration|consecrated]].

Reginald was the son of [[Josceline de Bohon]], [[bishop of Salisbury]], although he was possibly born before his father became a priest.<ref name=HenryII535>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 535</ref> Reginald was a great-great-grandson of [[Humphrey de Bohun]], one of the companions of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]].<ref name=Spear4>Spear "The Norman Empire and the Secular Clergy" ''The Journal of British Studies'' p. 4</ref> Some sources say that he was born while his father was studying law in [[Italy]]. His uncle [[Richard de Bohon]] was [[Bishop of Coutances]] from 1151 to 1180.<ref name=Becket78>[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Barlow, Frank]], ''Becket'' p. 78</ref> He was also related to [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]].<ref name=DNB>Duggan "Reginald fitz Jocelin (c.1140<U+2013>1191)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9613 Online Edition, May 2006] accessed November 8, 2007</ref> [[Savaric FitzGeldewin]], Reginald's successor at Bath was Reginald's father's second cousin.<ref name=Spear4/> Reginald's mother may have a member of the family of the [[House of Savoy|counts]] of [[Maurienne]]. He was born and brought up in [[Italy]], which led to him sometimes being referred to as Reginald Italus, Reginald Lombardus or Reginald the Lombard.<ref name=DNB/> He was appointed [[Archdeacon of Wiltshire]] by his father before [[December 8]] [[1161]], when he first signed a document as [[archdeacon]].<ref name=BHOSalis>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34228#n3 British History Online Archdeacons of Wiltshire] accessed on September 10, 2007</ref> He served in Thomas Becket's household after Becket became [[archbishop]], and by June of 1164 was serving Becket's interests in [[France]] at both the court of the French King Louis VII and the papal [[Roman Curia|Curia]]. It was probably in November of 1164 that Louis named Reginald abbot of the Abbey of Corbeil.<ref name=Becket107>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 107</ref>

Reginald probably studied at [[Paris]] sometime during 1163 or 1164, as he had a letter of introduction from Pope Alexander III to [[Hugues de Champfleury]], [[Bishop of Soissons]], the chancellor of Louis VII. Reginald did not complete his studies for the title of master, however, as he was in service with the King of England by 1167.<ref name=DNB/> He served King Henry II as a royal messenger to Rome during the crisis with Becket in 1167.<ref name=HenryII535/> For the next four years, Reginald would be embroiled in the dispute and with trying to find a diplomatic solution to it.<ref name=Becket175>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 175</ref> While serving Henry, Reginald incurred Becket's displeasure enough that Becket called Reginald "that offspring of fornication, that enemy to the peace of the Church, that traitor."<ref name=HenryIIquote/> However, [[John of Salisbury]] always maintained friendly relations with both Reginald and his father, even though John was a partisan of Becket's.<ref name=Becket78/> 

Reginald took part in the negotiations in August and September of 1169 that attempted to reach a settlement between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks. However, in the end, the negotiations came to nothing, and led to Becket's calling Reginald a traitor, among other things quoted above.<ref name=Becket189>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 189-192</ref> Reginald was one of the main clerics that worked for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with [[John of Oxford]], [[Richard of Ilchester]], and [[Geoffrey Ridel]]. Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.<ref name=Becket223>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 223-224</ref>

==Bishop of Bath==
[[Image:B-Alexander III1.jpg|thumb|left|Pope Alexander III confirmed Reginald as Bishop of Wells]]
Reginald was elected Bishop of Bath in late April of 1173, and was consecrated [[23 June]] [[1174]].<ref name=Handbook228>Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 228</ref> However, Henry the Young King challenged the election, on the grounds of [[illegitimate|illegitimacy]] and an [[Canon law|uncanonical]] election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of [[Richard of Dover]], who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury, and whom was also facing a challenge from the Young King to his election.<ref name=DNB/> Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on [[April 18]] [[1174]]<ref name=BHOBath>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=34341 British History Online Bishops of Bath] accessed on September 10, 2007</ref> with [[Walter Map]] alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. [[Ralph de Diceto]], however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest.<ref name=DNB/> 

As a bishop, Reginald was kept busy attending the king's councils and the royal court, but also took part in the 1178 mission to [[Toulouse]], led by Cardinal [[Pierre of San Crisogono]], which attempted to deal with the [[Cathar]] heretics there. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180's, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he took part in the coronation of King [[Richard I of England]].<ref name=DNB/> In April of 1191 he was one of the persons selected to arbitrate between the chancellor [[William Longchamp]] and Prince [[John of England]].<ref name=Powell97>Powell ''The House of Lords'' p. 97</ref> He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on [[October 5]] [[1191]] at Loddon Bridge between [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] that dismissed Longchamp from his offices.<ref>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 375</ref> He may have been an unsuccessful candidate for the [[Lord Chancellor|chancellorship]] of England. He was active as a bishop, and some 122 acta from his time as bishop survive.<ref name=DNB/> He built the hospital of St. John in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], as well as building extensively at [[Wells]]. He also issued a confirmation of the status of the town of Wells.<ref name=DNB/>

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

Reginald was elected to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishopric of Canterbury]] on [[27 November]] [[1191]], but his death on [[26 December]] [[1191]] prevented his consecration.<ref name=Handbook232>Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 232</ref> He was probably elected because he had supported the monks of Canterbury against their archbishop [[Baldwin of Exeter]] in their dispute over the foundation of a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket.<ref name=DNB/> He died at [[Dogmersfield]], [[Hampshire]] and was buried at Bath.<ref name=BHOBath/> Before his death, he was admitted as a [[confrater]] of [[Christ Church Priory]], Canterbury, and was buried in the habit of a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]].<ref name=Monastic477>Knowles ''The Monastic Order in England'' p. 477-478</ref> According to a monk of [[Eynsham Abbey]], after Reginald's death "he performed miraculous cures for certain weak and sick people."<ref name=QBartlett607>quoted in Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings: 1075-1225'' p. 607</ref> The same source claimed Reginald wore a hair shirt under his episcopal vestments.<ref name=Bartlett607>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 607</ref>
