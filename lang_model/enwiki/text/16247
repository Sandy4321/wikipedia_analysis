''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'' was the first Disney Channel series to feature a [[tag scene]] (the final scene of a sitcom episode, featuring the closing credits running over it) at the end of each episode.

Prior to 2006, all Disney Channel series featured the episode's final scene and the closing credits shown separately.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

As of June 11, 2010, ''The Suite Life'' series reached the record of the most episodes from a Disney Channel series and its spin-off. ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'' and ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' surpassed the previous record holders, ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Cory in the House]]'', which held the record with 134 episodes.

==Characters==
{{See also|The Suite Life of Zack & Cody recurring characters}}
<!-- Do Not re-order these characters. They are listed in the same order throughout the article for consistency. -->
===Cody Martin===

{{Main|Cody Martin}}
Cody Martin (Cole Sprouse) is the calm, mature, and smarter twin. He is a "straight [[Academic grading in North America#United States|A]]" student (except in wood shop, which he receives a C in, but uses Pass Fail), making him better, academically, than his brother Zack, who gets "D"s. In the first season of the show it was revealed that Cody is ten minutes younger than Zack.<ref name=agedifferenceproof>Suite Life on Deck episode: Bermuda Triangle - Cody says that he was born at 6:40, Zack says that he was born at 6:30</ref> Janice and Jessica seem to like Cody more (due to his sensitive nature). Cody has an on-again, off-again girlfriend named Barbara. Cody has attended a Week in Washington program and math camp. Cody is the more gentle twin compared to his brother and somehow always gets talked into going along with Zack's schemes. In ''The Fairest of Them All'', he dressed as a girl to win money. And never drinks soda after 9:30 (unless he is at a bachelor party).
<!-- Do Not re-order these characters. They are listed in the same order throughout the article for consistency. -->

===Zack Martin===

{{Main|Zack Martin}}
Zack Martin (Dylan Sprouse) is typically the self-centered, non-studious, outgoing, immature twin, who usually dresses in skater clothes. At school, he is a straight "D" student, although he does well in wood shop. In the first season of the show it was revealed that Zack is ten minutes older than Cody,<ref name="agedifferenceproof"/> which he uses against Cody, normally telling him, since he's older, to do some sort of job that he doesn't want to do. Or in some cases, give him "brotherly" advice because, "I'm the older twin." He has a crush on Maddie, but after the first season, this was shown less. He has also taken advantage of teachers and has faked conditions like dyslexia (in ''Smart and Smarterer'').

===London Tipton===

{{Main|London Tipton}}
London Tipton (Brenda Song) is the daughter of Wilfred Tipton, the owner of the Tipton Hotel. London is a  vain, dim-witted, spoiled, rich teenager with her own private suite at the Tipton Hotel in Boston, complete with a large wardrobe with several divisions (each with their own talking mirror) and a kitchen. London loves fashion; she only wears designer clothes and hates plaid, especially the plaid Catholic school uniforms. She does not have a nanny, or any other adult, to help her but relies on the Tipton Hotel Staff for any assistance or guidance. In the episode ''Forever Plaid'', due to her poor attendance at her old school, she transferred to the same Catholic girls' school, "Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow," that Maddie attends. In the episode ''First Day of High School'', London transfers to Zack and Cody's public school, "Cheevers High," due to being expelled from all of the private schools she had previously attended. She dislikes her step-moms (previous and current) and usually talks to Mr. Moseby and Maddie about her problems. When happy she always claps her hands repeatedly while saying her catchphrase, "Yay me!" She also has her own web show called "''Yay Me! Starring London Tipton''" that exists both within the program and in the real world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelife/yaymestarringlondontipton|title=Yay Me! Starring London Tipton|publisher=Disney|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> London often refuses to go to school and even skipped detention twice. Though it seems like London may lead the ultimate rich-girl life, her childhood was not perfect. In the episode ''Arwinstein'', she states she is allergic to lobster, although in one episode she asked Maddie for a lobster dinner. However, it is possible that she developed an allergy to lobster after the earlier episodes and before the later ones. It is also revealed in one episode that she must think about what she does before doing it. For example, she was walking through the lobby while thinking "left, right, blink, breathe" in the episode ''Super Twins'' (although this may be Zack's dream).

===Maddie Fitzpatrick===

{{Main|Maddie Fitzpatrick}}
Maddie Fitzpatrick (Ashley Tisdale) is the teenage candy-counter girl at the Tipton Hotel, who throughout the series holds several other jobs/positions including a cashier at the Cluck Bucket, manager on the Camp Tipton Daycare Center, and counselor for her school's summer camp program - Camp Heaven on Earth. She also visits [[Antarctica]] during the series to help save the penguins. While she comes from a lower class family, Maddie is very hard-working, outspoken, and intelligent. But in several episodes she is shown as being very selfish and a bigger opportunist than London, though she always loses out when this side of her personality is shown. Like Esteban, it is shown she has an incredibly long name; in the episode "Pilot Your Own Life," it is revealed to be Madeline Margaret Genevieve Miranda Catherine Fitzpatrick.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pilot Your Own Life|episodelink=List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep23|series=The Suite Life of Zack & Cody|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=2006-01-06|season=1|number=23|minutes=9:40}}</ref> She attends private school at "Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow" and later attends "Cheevers High." Maddie is London's closest friend, though London often treats her like a servant, as in the episode ''Footloser'', usually bribing her with money. Maddie also babysat Zack and Cody throughout season one. Zack has a huge crush on her in Season One, however the crush isn't shown as much during the other two seasons. She is a strong supporter of environmental causes. She is left-handed. It is revealed that she has [[asthma]]. She appeared sporadically throughout Season 3.

===Mr. Moseby===

{{Main|Mr. Moseby}}
Mr. Moseby (Phill Lewis) is the uptight manager of the Tipton Hotel, who speaks with a humongous vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, and is often annoyed by Zack's and Cody's schemes.  His repeated catch phrases, "Good luck with that" or "Pish posh" have become his trademark.  Though he acts as though he does not care about the boys, he actually has a great deal of affection for them.  For example, when Mr. Moseby took the boys to a baseball game, he caught a ball for Cody, ultimately making Mr. Moseby "the most hated man in Boston".  In the episode "The Ghost of 613," it is revealed that he started out at the Tipton as a bellhop back in the 1970s, and had a "voluminous 'fro".  Mr. Moseby is more of a father to London than her own, because Mr. Tipton is seldom around.  Moseby even taught London how to walk, her ABCs, and tried to teach her how to drive.  He cares for London and treats her like his own child.  He also helps London with any problems she is having.  He was also known as the "Meanager," due to his stern personna.  He has an older brother named Spencer, who is a little person (played by Dana Michael Woods), who is very wealthy and lactose intolerant.  His mothers' name is Beulah Moseby, who favors Spencer, but still likes Marion.  His grandmother is Rose Moseby (whom Phill Lewis also plays) who visits him in the episode "Nugget of History".  He has a 16-year-old niece named Nia Moseby (played by [[Giovonnie Samuels]]) who comes to stay with him during the third season and temporarily replaces Maddie as candy counter girl, while she is in Antarctica.  A running gag of the series is that Mr. Moseby often makes a fool of himself in front of people (e.g.: hitting a baby doll that wouldn't stop crying against a chair when a woman with a baby walked by), or making a sarcastic comment about himself (that the customers think is true, and not sarcastic).  Another running joke is that he often just barely catches a vase on the center table of the lobby from falling, although he fails to do that in the series' finale.  In his schooling he was captain of the cheerleading squad; his experience with cheering comes in useful in a cheer-off.  He also was a junior putt-putt champion and taught Zack how to succeed in playing mini-golf.  Mr. Moseby also took ballet lessons and is a very good dancer.  When he practiced and participated in Esteban's dance school, he was temporarily partnered with Carey, but found it hard to dance with her since she is much taller than he is.  He also takes advantage of Zack and Cody in some cases, like in the episode "Heck's Kitchen" he treats them with room service so they will find a food critic.

===Carey Martin===

{{Main|Carey Martin}}
Carey Martin (Kim Rhodes) is the single working mother of Zack and Cody is the hotel's lounge singer. She and her sons traveled to several cities before arriving at the Boston Tipton, which she called the "best gig we've ever had." She was married to Kurt Martin, but they divorced after the twins were born for unstated reasons. The character of Arwin has made it known on several occasions that he has a crush on her. Whenever Carey kisses Arwin he faints. When Zack and Cody have an argument, she tells them stories about her ex-boyfriends, much to their dismay.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes}}

The [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] resulted in no new episodes being shown starting in early February 2008. Instead, [[Disney Channel]] re-aired the first thirteen episodes of the series. After the strike ended, new episodes resumed on April 19, 2008. The show eventually ended for good with its series finale, a total of three seasons and 87 episodes on September 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody/show/28842/episode_listings.html?season=3&tag=nav_bar;3|title=The Suite Life of Zack and Cody Episode List|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

=== That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana ===
On July 28, 2006, [[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]] premiered. It is the very first Disney Channel [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] special. It featured the casts of That's So Raven, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, and Hannah Montana. It is divided into three parts: "Checkin' Out," "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana," and "On the Road Again?"

'''Checkin' Out''': The special started with the That's So Raven episode "Checkin' Out." When Raven Baxter checks into the Tipton Hotel, she meets Zack, Cody, and Mr. Moseby along with pretending to be a famous fashion photographer.

'''That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana''': When Raven finds out her flight back home is canceled, she stays and befriends Maddie Fitzpatrick. Maddie then tries to make London Tipton wear the dress that Raven designed. Meanwhile, Zack and Cody are planning their mother's surprise birthday party, but Raven has a vision that Cody will be attacked, and warns him that he should be careful when he hears bells and sneezing.

'''On the Road Again?''': After checking in to the Tipton, Hannah befriends Maddie, so Maddie met her father and she recognized him as Robby Ray. Miley knew she must do something to get her father's Robby Ray identity back, because she believes that because of Hannah Montana, Robby had to give up his career as a singer.

It is across the street from another mini mart with a patriotic name and theme, The Betsy Ross Stop and Shop, which is run by Wormser's business enemy and fierce rival.

;Camp Heaven On Earth
The summer camp where Maddie works over the summer. The only part of the camp shown is the cabin in which Maddie and the young girls stay.

;Cheevers High School
Where Zack, Cody, London, Maddie, and Nia attend along with other students including Barbara, Bob, and Mark. This setting was used in "Lip Synchin' in the Rain," "First Day of High School," "Orchestra," and "Benchwarmers." [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles, California)]] is shown in a snapshot as Cheevers High School.

;Other places in Boston
Scenes also take place in several other places in Boston, including [[Fenway Park]], a movie theater, Maddie's apartment, the local shopping mall, a bowling alley (The same bowling alley was used to film a scene from the [[Hannah Montana]] episode, "People Who Use People"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/hannah-montana/people-who-use-people/episode/724978/summary.html|title=Hannah Montana Episode 18: People Who Use People|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> a miniature golf course, Kurt's apartment, Mr. Moseby's condo, the Goose Lodge, Liberty Park, an apartment where Maddie and her friends painted for a poor family for community service, Arwin's apartment, camp Knock-a-Number, the forest that has Merele's cabin, Kurt's tour bus, the shop where Maddie demanded London give her inhaler, an art museum, a dance club, an alley with a garbage container, a pizza restaurant, Theo's home, the "Risk It All" studio, the Cluck Bucket, an aptitude company, and the restaurant where Wayne "dates" London. There are even two episodes that take place in Hollywood, which includes a movie studio, LAX, a beach, Sunset Blvd, Hollywood Blvd, and the Tipton Los Angeles.

==Theme song and opening sequence==
The show's theme song, "Here I Am," was written by John Adair and Steve Hampton (who also wrote the theme for the show's spinoff ''The Suite Life on Deck'', as well as for fellow Disney Channel series ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', and ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'',  and the [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] series ''[[Power Rangers: RPM]]''), with music composed by Gary Scott (who also composed the music cues to signal scene changes and promo breaks, which are styled similarly to the theme), and is performed by Loren Ellis and [[the Drew Davis Band]] (who also performed the theme to ''Phil of the Future'', and whose performance is uncredited).

The opening title sequence to the show begins with a shot of the Tipton Hotel's ground floor exterior, which then zooms to a window on what is presumed to be the 23rd Floor of the hotel (where Zack, Cody and Carey's suite is), which then displays clips from various episodes (which were updated for each season), with five clips featuring each cast member being shown after the computerized Tipton hotel exterior shoots from window to window. The sequence then closes with the show's title logo (a door plaque with the words "The Suite Life" with a piece of paper with the words "of Zack and Cody", made to look as if drawn by differently colored crayons, attached to it), which was accompanied by the Disney logo atop the title logo for the third season (all Disney Channel sitcoms made from 2007 onwards feature the Disney logo above the title logo). Starting with season two, the cast members and creators' names were displayed with a yellow glow around the text.

==Spin-off series and film==
