The {{nihongo|''[[Xenosaga]]''|<U+30BC><U+30CE><U+30B5><U+30FC><U+30AC>}} series is a series of [[science fiction]] [[Role-playing video game]]s developed by [[Monolith Soft]] and published by [[Namco Bandai]] on the [[PlayStation 2]]. The series began with the 2002 release of ''[[Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht|Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht]]'', which was followed in 2004 by ''[[Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B<U+00F6>se|Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B<U+00F6>se]]'' and in 2006 by ''[[Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra|Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra]]''. The '''Music of the ''Xenosaga'' series''' includes the soundtracks to all three chapters, as well as the music for its spin-off media. These include ''Xenosaga Freaks'', a set of minigames set between the first two chapters, ''Xenosaga I &  II'', a [[Nintendo DS]] remake of the first two chapters, and ''Xenosaga: The Animation'', an [[anime]] series covering the events of the first game. ''Episode I'' was composed by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], ''Episode II'' was split between [[Yuki Kajiura]] and [[Shinji Hosoe]], and ''Episode III'' was composed by Kajiura alone. ''Xenosaga Freaks'' reused some of the music of ''Episode I'' by Mitsuda while also including new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, while ''Xenosaga I & II'' and ''Xenosaga: The Animation'' used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita.

''Episode I'' sparked the release of two versions of its soundtrack album as well as a single, ''Episode II'' received two soundtrack albums, and ''Episode III'' received one. ''Xenosaga Freaks'' and ''Xenosaga: The Animation'' each also sparked the release of a soundtrack album. In addition to the albums, ''Episode I'' saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music; ''Episode II'' had only a book of piano sheet music. Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts, especially that of the first two games.

The first episode in the series was ''[[Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht]]'', released in 2002. Designed as a spiritual successor to ''[[Xenogears]]'', the game was developed by many of the same staff, including the composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]].<ref name="Xenogears">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/xenosaga/news.html?sid=2823598&mode=previews|title=Xenosaga Interview|last=Sato|first=Ike|date=2001-11-08|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> For the game, Mitsuda composed a score that is mostly orchestral in nature, using the London Philharmonic Orchestra for several tracks. Other pieces include vocal tracks by the [[Metro Voices]] choir, piano solos by Yasuharu Nakanishi, and performances by the Gen Ittetsu Strings. The game's theme songs, "Pain" and "Kokoro", were sung by Celtic singer [[Joanne Hogg]] of the band [[Iona (band)|Iona]], whom Mitsuda had used previously for the soundtrack to ''Xenogears''. The vocal songs throughout the soundtrack range from choral to opera to a capella.<ref name="RPGFXENO1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs-ost/index.html|title=Xenosaga OST|last=Maas|first=Liz|coauthors=Thomas, Damian; Farand, Eric|date=2002-03-17|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref>

The first release of the soundtrack as an album was the ''Xenosaga Original Soundtrack'', released by [[DigiCube]] on March 6, 2002. The two-disc album includes every piece from the game's soundtrack, with a total length of 1:58:42 across its 45 tracks.<ref name="RPGFXENO1"/> Two years later, on May 19, 2004, Mitsuda released another version of the soundtrack through his Sleigh Bells label titled ''Xenosaga Episode I''. This version features two new tracks<U+2014>"World to be Born" and "Pain ~piano version~"<U+2014>as well as re-recording some of the tracks. The playlist order was also changed between the two versions, with ''Episode I'' grouping the tracks by style, rather than in rough chronological order within the game like the original album.<ref name="RPGFXENO12">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs1/index.html|title=Xenosaga Episode I|last=Gann|first=Patrick|date=2005-08-13|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> In addition to the two albums, a single, "Kokoro", was released for the game's theme songs. Published by DigiCube, the disc includes "Pain" and "Kokoro" from the original soundtrack as well as a piano rendition of Kokoro and instrumental versions of both songs. The album has a total length of 23:55, and was released on February 6, 2002.<ref name="RPGFKOKORO">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs-single/index.html|title=Xenosaga - Kokoro|last=Maas|first=Liz|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref>

The second episode of the series, ''[[Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B<U+00F6>se]]'', was released in 2004. Mitsuda did not return to compose the soundtrack; instead, [[Yuki Kajiura]] and [[Shinji Hosoe]] were brought into the project. Kajiura had previously composed for a few video games as well as numerous [[anime]] soundtracks. Her style for the game's soundtrack, for which she composed only the numerous cinematic scenes, has been described as "a fusion of electronica and techno with either an orchestra or ethnic instruments," as well as including vocals in places where many composers would have left an instrumental section.<ref name="RPGFXENO2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs2-movie/index.html|title=Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und B<U+00F6>se Movie Scene Soundtrack|last=Schweitzer|first=Ben|date=2005-05-30|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> Hosoe composed the music for the playable portions of the game. He feels that, primarily because he "slashed the orchestral sound while creating the music" so that the music played using the PlayStation 2's sound chip would match the music played off of the CD, that the sound quality and balance of the soundtrack is poor. He had predicted that there would be a fan outcry against "changing composers on a series like Xenosaga", and suspects that his music from the game will never be released on an album; the released albums for the game include only Kajiura's work.<ref name="SEMOHOSOEint">{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/shinjihosoe.shtml|title=Interview with Shinji Hosoe|last=Chris|date=2010-01-26|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> Kajiura and Hosoe did not collaborate on any of the tracks in ''Episode II''; according to Kajiura they never even met during the production.<ref name="OSVKAJint">{{cite web|url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/?p=3027|title=Anime Boston 2009: Interview with Kalafina and Yuki Kajiura|last=Kotowski|first=Don|date=2009-05-26|publisher=Original Sound Version|accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref>

''Episode II''{{'}}s soundtrack was first released as an album on July 7, 2004 as ''Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und B<U+00F6>se Movie Scene Soundtrack'' by [[Victor Entertainment]]. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks and has a duration of 1:52:26.<ref name="RPGFXENO2"/> Another soundtrack album for the game, ''Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B<U+00F6>se Soundtrack'', was released by [[Namco]] and [[Brady Games]] as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25.<ref name="RPGFXENO22">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs2-us/index.html|title=Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B<U+00F6>se Soundtrack|last=Thomas|first=Damian|date=2006-09-04|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref>

The third and final episode in the series, ''[[Xenosaga Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', was released in 2006. Composed entirely by Kajiura, her style shifted from that of ''Episode II'' to be darker, with a larger focus on rhythm and less use of background vocals.<ref name="RPGFXENO3">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs3/index.html|title=Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks|last=Schweitzer|first=Ben|date=2006-07-23|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> Despite moving from composing only the cinematic tracks in ''Episode II'' to composing the whole score for ''Episode III'', Kajiura says that the difficulty of each game's score was about the same. She primarily drew her inspiration for the music from the game's artwork and her conception of the world the game was set in.<ref name="OSVKAJint"/>

The only soundtrack album released for the game was ''Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks'', an album of selections from the soundtrack rather than all of the tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006.<ref name="RPGFXENO3"/>

==Spin-off media==
The spin-off media of the ''Xenosaga'' series to include music are a collection of minigames titled ''Xenosaga Freaks'' that explores the backstory of ''Episode I'', a remake of the first two episodes for the [[Nintendo DS]] titled ''Xenosaga I & II'', and an anime series titled ''[[Xenosaga: The Animation]]''. There are also other media adaptions without music like a manga series. ''Xenosaga Freaks'' reused some of the music of ''Episode I'' by Mitsuda while also including new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, while ''Xenosaga I & II'' and ''Xenosaga: The Animation'' used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita. 

''Freaks'' sparked the release of an album, ''Xenosaga Freaks Reservation Privilege CD'', which includes three vocal tracks sung by the voice actresses for the characters Shion, KOS-MOS, and M.O.M.O. from the game, a fourth vocal track featuring all three of the singers, and a radio-style interview with them. The 31:08 long album was released by Namco on April 28, 2004. The music, composed by Namco composers Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, is described as "silly lighthearted techno-pop", and very different from the music in the main games of the series.<ref name="RPGFFREAKS">{{cite web|url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/xs-freaks/index.html|title=Xenosaga Freaks Reservation Privilege CD|last=Gann|first=Patrick|date=2006-08-11|publisher=[[Namco]]|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> ''Xenosaga: The Animation'' also received an album release, titled ''Xenosaga: The Animation Original Soundtrack''; the 35-track album was released by [[Columbia Records]] on Mar 23, 2005.

Music from the series was performed at the three-show "Passion" concert series held in December 2006 by the [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]]. The concerts included "Pain" from ''Episode I'' and "Sakura" from ''Episode II''.
