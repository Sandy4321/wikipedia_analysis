'''Anthony Charles Lynton Blair''' (born [[6 May]] [[1953]])<ref name="EB"/> is the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]], [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Minister for the Civil Service]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], and [[Member of Parliament]] for the constituency of [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in the [[North East England|North East]] of [[England]]. As a member of the British [[Cabinet]] he is also a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]]. His [[official residence]] is [[10 Downing Street]], London, SW1A 2AA.<ref>However, since Blair and his wife at the time had three children living with them, it was announced in 1997 that the Blairs would be living in the flat above number 11 Downing Street, whereas Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was unmarried and childless at the time, would live in the smaller flat, above number 10.</ref>

Blair became leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|July 1994]] following the sudden death of his predecessor, [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]]. Under Blair's leadership, the party won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], ending 18 years of government by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister, the only person to have led the party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour prime minister to serve more than one full consecutive term.

On [[7 September]] [[2006]] Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] conference in September 2007, but has not yet given a date for his departure.<ref name="iwillquit"> {{cite news| title = I will quit within a year - Blair| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 2006-09-07| accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref>

==Background and family life==
Tony Blair was born at the Queen Mary Maternity Home<ref name="Edinburgh Evening-birthplace">{{cite news | title = Blair's birthplace is bulldozed in Edinburgh | url = http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1156262006 | work = [[Edinburgh Evening News]] | publisher =Johnston Press plc | date = 2006-08-09| accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref> in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], the second son of [[Leo Blair (senior)|Leo]] and Hazel Blair (''n<U+00E9>e'' Corscadden). Leo Blair was the son of two [[English people|English]] actors, Charles Parsons and Mary Augusta Ridgway Bridson, whilst Hazel Corscadden's family were [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Protestant]]s from [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]]. He has one elder brother, [[William Blair (barrister)|William Blair]], who is a [[barrister]] and a [[Queen's Counsel|Queen's Counsel (QC)]], and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the [[Willowbrae]] area of Edinburgh. During this period his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name="Edinburgh Evening-birthplace"/> His family spent three and a half years in the 1950s living in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], where his father was a lecturer in law at the [[University of Adelaide]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Tony's big adventure | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/secondterm/story/0,8224,944191,00.html|work = [[The Observer]] | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 2003-04-27 | accessdate = 2006-11-18
}}</ref> The Blairs lived quite close to the university, in the leafy suburb of [[Dulwich, South Australia|Dulwich]].

The family returned to Britain in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's parents at their home in [[Stepps]], near [[Glasgow]]. Blair spent the remainder of his childhood in [[Durham]], [[England]], his father being by then a lecturer at [[Durham University]]. After attending Durham's [[Chorister School]] Blair boarded at [[Fettes College]], a famous [[independent school]] in Edinburgh, where he met [[Charlie Falconer]], whom he later appointed [[Lord Chancellor]]. Blair reportedly modelled himself on [[Mick Jagger]], and is said to have enjoyed a reputation as a conspicuously "[[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]" [[Boy|young man]] among his fellow pupils. His teachers, however, were less impressed by his behaviour: his biographer John Rentoul reported that "All the teachers I spoke to... said he was a complete pain in the backside, and they were very glad to see the back of him."

[[Image:CherieBooth.jpg|right|thumb|Tony Blair's wife, [[Cherie Booth]] QC]]
After Fettes, Blair spent a year in London, where he attempted to find fame as a [[rock music]] promoter, before going up to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] to [[reading (for degree)|read]] law at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]]. As a student, he played [[guitar]] and sang for a [[rock band]] called [[Ugly Rumours (band)|Ugly Rumours]]. During this time, he dated future [[American Psycho]] director [[Mary Harron]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800256658/bio 
| title = Mary Harron Biography| accessdate = 2006-11-18| year = 2006 | work = Yahoo! Movies| publisher = Yahoo! Inc.}}</ref> After graduating from Oxford with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|second class degree]], Blair became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]], enrolled as a pupil barrister and met his future wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]] (daughter of the actor [[Anthony Booth|Tony Booth]]) at the [[Chambers (law)|Chambers]] founded by [[Derry Irvine]] (who was to be Blair's first Lord Chancellor), [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers]]. His biographer Rentoul records that, according to his lawyer friends, Blair was much less concerned about which party he was affiliated with than about his aim of becoming [[Prime Minister]].

Blair married Booth, a practising [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and future [[Queen's Counsel]], on [[29 March]] [[1980]]. They have four children ([[Euan Blair|Euan]], [[Nicky Blair|Nicky]], [[Kathryn Blair|Kathryn]] and [[Leo Blair|Leo]]). Leo (born [[20 May]] [[2000]]) was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Francis Russell was born to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] on [[11 July]] [[1849]].

Although the Blairs stated that they had wished to shield their children from the media, Euan and Nicky's education was a cause of political controversy. They both attended the Catholic [[London Oratory School]], criticised by left-wingers for its selection procedures instead of a poorly-performing [[Catholic school]] in Labour-controlled [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], where they then lived, in Richmond Avenue. There was further criticism when it was revealed that Euan received private coaching from staff from [[Westminster School]]. 

==Early political career==
Blair joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. During the early 1980s, he was involved in Labour politics in [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]], where he aligned himself with the "[[soft left]]" of the party. He unsuccessfully attempted to secure selection as a candidate for [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney Borough Council]]. Through his [[father-in-law]], the actor [[Anthony Booth|Tony Booth]], he contacted Labour MP [[Tom Pendry]] to ask for help in pursuing a Parliamentary career. Pendry gave him a tour of the House of Commons and advised him to stand for selection as a candidate in the forthcoming [[by-election]] in the safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], where Pendry knew a senior member of the local party. Blair was chosen as the candidate; at the [[Beaconsfield by-election, 1982|Beaconsfield by-election]] he won only 10% of the vote and lost his deposit, but he impressed Labour Party leader [[Michael Foot]] and acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair described himself in this period as a [[Socialism|Socialist]]. A letter that he wrote to Foot in July 1982, eventually published in [[June 2006]], gives an indication of his outlook at this time.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Blair | title = The full text of Tony Blair's letter to Michael Foot written in July 1982 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/16/nletter116.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/06/16/ixuknews.html  | work = The Daily Telegraph | publisher = Telegraph Media Group Ltd. | date = July 1982 | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref>

In 1983 Blair found that the newly created constituency of [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]], near where he had grown up in [[Durham]], had no Labour candidate. Several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were interested in securing selection to fight the seat. He found a branch that had not made a nomination and arranged to visit them. With the crucial support of John Burton, he won their endorsement; at the last minute he was added to the shortlist and won the selection over displaced sitting MP [[Les Huckfield]]. Burton later became his agent and one of his most trusted and longest-standing allies.

Blair's election literature in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]] endorsed left-wing policies that the Labour Party advocated in the early 1980s. He called for Britain to leave the [[European Union|EEC]], though he had told his selection conference that he personally favoured continuing membership. He also supported [[Nuclear disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]], being a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Sedgefield was a safe Labour seat and Blair was elected as its MP, despite the party's national landslide defeat. Blair was helped on the campaign trail by [[soap opera|soap]] actress [[Pat Phoenix]], his father-in-law's girlfriend.

Blair stated in his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on [[6 July]] [[1983]]: "I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/4/20/170221.shtml | title = On Democracy | accessdate = 2006-11-18| last = Navrozov | first = Lev | date =2006-04-21 | work = newsmax.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_3.4/seddon.htm | title = America's Friend: Reflections on Tony Blair| accessdate = 2006-11-18| last = Seddon| first = Mark | year = 2004| work = Logos 3.4| publisher = }}</ref> The Labour Party is declared in its constitution to be a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour| title = About Labour| accessdate = 2006-11-18| year = 2006| publisher = The Labour Party}}</ref> rather than a [[social democratic]] party - Blair himself organised this declaration of Labour to be a [[Socialist Party|socialist party]] when he dealt with the change to the party's [[Clause IV]] in their constitution.

==In opposition==
Once elected, Blair's ascent was rapid, and he received his first shadow-cabinet appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. He demanded an inquiry into the [[Bank of England]]'s decision to rescue the collapsed [[Johnson Matthey Bank]] in [[1985|October 1985]], and embarrassed the government by finding a [[European Economic Community]] report critical of British economic policy that had been countersigned by a member of the Conservative government. By this time Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party, headed by leader [[Neil Kinnock]], and was promoted after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the [[City of London]]. In 1987, he stood for election to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], with a good show of 77 votes.

[[Image:Blairclosedshop.jpg|left|thumb|As Shadow Employment Secretary, Blair announces that the Labour Party no longer supports the '[[closed shop]]' ([[18 December]] [[1989]])]]

After the [[stock market crash]] of [[1987|October 1987]], Blair raised his profile further when he castigated City traders as "incompetent" and "morally dubious", and criticised poor service for small investors at the [[London Stock Exchange]]. In 1988, Blair entered the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Energy]], and the following year he became Shadow Employment Secretary. In this post, he realised that the Labour Party's support for the emerging European "Social Charter" policies on [[Labour and employment law|employment law]] meant dropping the party's traditional support for [[closed shop]] arrangements, whereby employers required all their employees to be members of a [[trade union]]. He announced this change in December 1989, outraging the left wing of the Labour Party. As a young and telegenic Shadow Cabinet member, Blair was given prominence by the party's [[Director of Communications]], [[Peter Mandelson]]. His first major platform speech, at the 1990 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party conference]], was poor though, since he spoke too fast and lost his place in his notes.

In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], Blair worked to modernise Labour's image. He had responsibility for developing the controversial [[minimum wage]] policy.

When Neil Kinnock resigned as party leader after his electoral defeat, Blair became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]]. The Labour Party at this time was widely perceived as weak on crime and Blair worked to change this: he accepted that the prison population might have to rise, and bemoaned the loss of a [[sense of community]], which he was prepared to blame (at least partly) on "1960s liberalism". On the other hand, he spoke in support of equalising the [[age of consent]] for [[gay sex]] at 16, and opposed [[capital punishment]]. He defined his policy, in a phrase coined by [[Gordon Brown]], as "[[Tough on crime]], tough on the causes of crime".

John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Blair beat [[John Prescott]] and [[Margaret Beckett]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|subsequent leadership election]]. After becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]], Blair was, as is customary for the holder of that office, appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], which permitted him to be [[Style (manner of address)|addressed]] with the style "[[The Right Honourable]]".

===Leader of the Labour Party===
[[Image:Labour manifesto 97.jpg||thumb|right|The cover of Labour's [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] [[manifesto]]]]
Blair announced at the end of his speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference that he intended to replace [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to 'the [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and exchange', which was widely interpreted as referring to wholesale [[nationalization|nationalisation]]. The clause was replaced by a statement that the party is one of [[democratic socialism]]. A special conference approved this highly symbolic change in April 1995.

Blair also revised party policy in a manner that enhanced the image of Labour as competent and modern &mdash; he used the term "New Labour" to distinguish the party from its past. Although the transformation aroused much criticism (its alleged superficiality drawing fire both from political opponents and traditionalists within the "rank and file" of his own party), it was nevertheless successful in changing public perception. At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were "education, education and education".

Aided by the unpopularity of [[John Major]]'s Conservative government (itself deeply divided over the [[European Union]]), "New Labour" won a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] with Blair the youngest person to attain the office of Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| title = Biography: The Prime Minister Tony Charles Lynton Blair| accessdate = 2006-11-18| date = | work = www.number-10.gov.uk| publisher = }}</ref>

==Blair as Prime Minister==
{{main|Prime Ministry of Tony Blair}}
Blair first became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on [[2 May]] [[1997]]. While serving as Prime Minister, Blair concurrently serves as the [[First Lord of the Treasury]], the [[Minister for the Civil Service]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], and a [[Member of Parliament]] for the constituency of [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in the [[North East England|North East]] of [[England]]. As a member of the British [[Cabinet]] he is also a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister, the only person to have led the party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour prime minister to serve more than one full consecutive term.

Blair is both credited with and criticised for moving the Labour Party towards the [[Political centre|centre]] of British politics, using the term "[[Labour Party (UK)#New Labour|New Labour]]" to distinguish his pro-[[free market|market]] policies from the more [[Collectivism|collectivist]] policies which the party had espoused in the past. 

In domestic government policy, Blair has significantly increased [[Public finance|public spending]] on health and education while also introducing controversial market-based reforms in these areas. Blair's tenure has also seen the introduction of a [[minimum wage]], tuition fees for higher education, [[Constitutional amendment|constitutional reform]] such as [[devolution]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], and progress in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. The British economy has performed well, and Blair has kept to Conservative commitments not to increase income tax.

Since the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair has strongly supported [[Foreign relations of the United States|US foreign policy]], notably by participating in the invasions of [[2001 war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 2001 and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] in 2003. He has encountered fierce criticism as a result, over the policy itself and the circumstances in which it was decided upon. 

On [[7 September]] [[2006]] Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] conference in September 2007, but has not yet given a date for his departure.<ref name="iwillquit"> {{cite news| title = I will quit within a year - Blair| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 2006-09-07| accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref>

==Blair and Parliament==
[[Image:Tony Blair at PMQs.jpg|thumb|250px|[[British Prime Minister]] Tony Blair responding to a question in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. To the right is Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]].]]
Blair has changed Parliamentary procedures significantly. One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to replace the two weekly 15-minute sessions of [[Prime Minister's Questions]], held on a Tuesday and Thursday, with a single 30-minute session on a Wednesday. This reform was said to have led to greater efficiency, but critics have noted that it is easier to prepare for one long set of questions than for two shorter sessions. In addition to PMQs, Blair has held monthly [[News conference|press conferences]], at which he fields questions in a less confrontational manner than in the Commons.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page3347.asp | title = PM: Saddam and his regime will be removed| accessdate = 2006-11-21| date = 2003-03-25| format = | work = www.number10.gov.uk| publisher = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Matthew | last = Tempest | title = Tony Blair's press conference | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1299024,00.html | work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 2004-09-07 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

Other procedural reforms include changing the official times for Parliamentary sessions in order to have Parliament operate in a more business-like manner.

==Blair in the media==
While evaluations of Blair's skills as a parliamentarian differ, he is acknowledged to be a highly skillful media performer in other contexts, appearing modern, charismatic, informal and articulate. Perhaps his best known television appearance was his tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] on the morning of her death in August 1997, in which he famously described her as "the people's princess".

After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the [[Prime Minister's Official Spokesman]] (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was [[Alastair Campbell]], who served in that role from May 1997 to [[8 June]] [[2001]], after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on [[29 August]] [[2003]] in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]]. Campbell acquired a reputation as a sinister and Machiavellian figure, and both Blair and Campbell have frequently been criticised or [[satire|satirised]] for their allegedly excessive use of "spin" and [[Managing the news|news management]] techniques (see below under ''Criticism'').

==Blair and Gordon Brown==
After the death of John Smith in 1994, both Blair and Gordon Brown were viewed as possible candidates for the leadership of the Labour Party. They had agreed that they would not stand against each other, and Brown had previously been considered to be the more senior of the two men &mdash; he understood this to mean that Blair would give way to him. It soon became apparent, however, that Blair had greater public support.<ref>A MORI [[opinion poll]] published in the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' on [[15 May]] found that among the general public, Blair had the support of 32%, John Prescott, 19%, Margaret Beckett 14%, Gordon Brown 9%, and [[Robin Cook]] 5%.</ref> At the [[Granita (restaurant)|Granita]] restaurant in [[Islington]] on [[31 May]], Brown agreed with Blair that he would not contest the leadership election. He understood Blair to have agreed in return to step down as party leader after a specified period (after 8 years, according to some reports), but Blair has always denied striking any such deal with him. It may be that both men placed honestly differing interpretations on the same conversation. In September 2003, [[British television|British TV]] Channel [[Channel 4]] broadcast a one-off drama about the alleged agreement, called [[The Deal]], which culminated in the conversation in question. The final words of it, as spoken by the actors playing Blair and Brown, were as follows: 

'''Brown:''' And the election after that? (''i.e. the election following two terms of a Labour Government'')
'''Blair:''' Well... Obviously, I couldn't go on for ever.

It has also been alleged that while in office as Prime Minister, Blair gave Brown further indications (and even promises) that he would step down in Brown's favour at specified times. Whatever the truth of these reports, Blair's consistent refusal to leave office (so far) has led to relations between the two men becoming irretrievably embittered. At certain times, [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] has reportedly acted as their "marriage guidance counsellor".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Another aspect of the political relationship between Blair and Brown is the exceptional freedom given by Blair from the start of his time in office to his Chancellor in the area of economic policy. Downing Street insiders have subsequently reported that Blair grew to regret granting Brown this freedom, since he has been excluded from important fiscal decisions as a result.

Blair is still seen as refusing to endorse Gordon Brown as his successor. Commentators speculate that this reflects hopes in Downing Street that, given sufficient time, other candidates for Prime Minister will emerge so as to force a full leadership contest.<ref>{{cite news | first = David  | last = Cracknell | coauthors =Oakeshott, Isabel | title = Blair fails to back Brown | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2361498,00.html  | work = The Times | publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd. | date = 2006-09-17 | accessdate = 2006-11-21}}</ref>

==Blair's religious faith==
Blair has rarely discussed his [[Faith|religious faith]] in public, but he is often identified as an [[Anglo-Catholic]] <U+2014> that is, a member of the [[high church]] branch of the [[Church of England]], sympathetic to the beliefs and practices of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]] is a practising Roman Catholic, and Blair has attended Catholic Masses at [[Westminster Cathedral]], while on holiday in Italy, and with his family at his current home in Number 10 Downing Street. At one point, he was reprimanded by [[Basil Cardinal Hume]] for receiving [[Holy Communion]] at Mass despite not being a Roman Catholic, a contravention of Catholic doctrine.

In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] broadcast on [[ITV1]] on [[4 March]] [[2006]], Blair referred to the role of his [[Christianity|Christian faith]] in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had [[prayer|prayed]] about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision:<ref>{{cite news | title = Blair 'prayed to God' over Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-03-03 | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref> ''"I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people <U+2026> and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well."'' 

These comments prompted a number of questions on Mr Blair's faith, questions that he was advised not to answer. At the time, the bar on the topic was so rigid that [[Alastair Campbell]], Mr Blair's director of strategy and communications, intervened in an interview, preventing the Prime Minister from answering a question about his Christianity, explaining, "We don't do God".<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/05/04/nblair04.xml Campbell interrupted Blair as he spoke of his faith: 'We don't do God'], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 3 May 2003</ref>

==Political overview==
Which part of the [[political spectrum]] Tony Blair occupies is disputed. Many Britons would place him in the centre ground. His party (Labour) is a [[socialism|socialist]] political party, and Conservatives consider him [[Centre-left|left of centre]]. Yet some of his Labour-party backbenchers and other Left-wing critics would place him to the right of centre. Blair rarely applies such labels to himself, though he promised, in advance of the 1997 election, that New Labour would govern "from the radical centre", and he is on record as describing himself as a "[[Social democracy|social democrat]]".

An overview of Blair's policies gives an idea of the difficulty of defining him politically. He has raised taxes; implemented redistributive policies; introduced a minimum wage and some new employment rights (while keeping Margaret Thatcher's trade union legislation); introduced significant constitutional reforms (which remain incomplete and controversial); promoted new rights for [[Homosexuality|gay people]] in the Civil Partnerships Act; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU. He has also firmly supported George W. Bush's foreign policy (while reportedly attempting to act as a restraining influence on him), leading to Blair's rule being characterised by an interventionist foreign policy; introduced substantial [[Market economy|market-based]] reforms in the education and health sectors; introduced student tuition fees; sought to reduce certain categories of welfare payments; and introduced tough [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] and [[Identity document|identity card]] legislation (with claimed public support).

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of Tony Blair}}
The [[criticism of Tony Blair]] includes accusations of dishonesty and [[authoritarianism]], as well as criticism about his alliance with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], and his policies in the [[Middle East]], including the [[Iraq War]], the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] and the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

===Spin, authoritarianism and alleged dishonesty===
A widely levelled criticism of Blair and his subordinates is that they make use of spin to such an extent that his government has fundamentally lost credibility with the British public. It is also claimed that the Government has on occasions crossed the line between selective presentation of information and deliberate misleading.

===Presidentialism===
Blair is sometimes perceived as paying insufficient attention both to the views of his own Cabinet colleagues and to those of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. His style is sometimes criticised as not that of a prime minister and [[head of government]], which he is, but of a president and [[Head of State|head of state]], which he is not.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1004735,00.html</ref>

Blair has consistently supported the police and sought to increase [[police power]]s. While this policy initially attracted widespread support, the government's legislative response to the threat of [[militant Islam]]ism has been regarded by some as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Blair has often (particularly after the invasion of Iraq) been labelled as an insincere "King of Spin" and "Phoney Tony", and has been accused of [[cronyism]] in his perceived penchant for promoting his friends to top jobs (Tony's Cronies). In his early years, Blair was often criticised as an unscrupulous opportunist who was solely interested in doing anything that would get him elected, a [[focus group]] politician. More recently, his unpopular support of the United States over Iraq has shown more commitment to his own beliefs, despite public opposition. His name has been deliberately mis-spelt 'Tony Bliar' (sometimes 'B. Liar') or 'Tory Blur' by critics of his actions and his policies (particularly his stance on Iraq). ''[[The Economist]]'' on [[5 June]] [[2003]] devoted its front cover to a photograph of Blair and the headline, "Bliar?".

===Relationship with the United States===
[[Image:Blair Bush Whitehouse (2004-11-12).jpg|thumb|250px|George W. Bush and Tony Blair shake hands after their press conference in the East Room of the White House on [[12 November]] [[2004]].]]
Along with enjoying a close relationship with [[Bill Clinton]] during the latter's time in office, Blair has formed a strong political alliance with President [[George W. Bush]] of the [[United States of America]], particularly in the area of foreign policy: at one point, [[Nelson Mandela]] described Blair as "the US foreign minister".<ref>{{cite news | title = Mandela condemns US stance on Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2710181.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2003-01-30|accessdate = 2006-11-18}}</ref> Blair has also often openly been referred to as "Bush's poodle." <ref>{{cite news | title = Blair battles "poodle" jibes | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2003-02-03|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref>  Such claims received added credence in statements made by Kendall Myers, a senior analyst at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], who reportedly said that he felt "a little ashamed" of Bush's treatment of the Prime Minister and that his attempts to influence [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] policy were typically ignored -  "It was a done deal from the beginning, it was a one-sided relationship that was entered into with open eyes... There was nothing, no payback, no sense of reciprocity.".<ref> {{cite news | title = Bush 'routinely ignoring Blair' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6158435.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-11-30|accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref>

For his part, President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] has lauded Blair and the UK. In his post-September 11 speech, for example, he stated that "America has no truer friend than Great Britain".<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html President Declares "Freedom at War with Fear"]</ref> The alliance between Bush and Blair has seriously damaged Blair's standing in the eyes of many [[Briton|British people]].<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1828225,00.html Guardian/ICM poll finds strong public opposition to Tony Blair's close working relationship with President Bush]</ref>

===Middle East policy and links with Israel===
One of Blair's first actions in joining the Labour Party was to join [[Labour Friends of Israel]]. In 1994, a friend and former colleague of Blair at [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers]], [[Eldred Tabachnik]], [[Q.C.]] (one time president of the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]]) introduced Blair to [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy, later Lord Levy]], a [[pop music]] mogul and major fundraiser for Jewish and Israeli causes, at a dinner party hosted by the [[Israel]]i diplomat [[Gideon Meir]].<ref name="bagman">{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/funding/story/0,,1734529,00.html?gusrc=rss | title=There was once a jolly bagman | author=Euan Ferguson | publisher=Guardian|date=March 19, 2006}}</ref> Blair and Levy soon became close friends and [[tennis]] partners. Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 General Election and received substantial contributions from such figures as [[Alex Bernstein]] and [[Robert Gavron]], both of whom were ennobled by Blair after he came to power. Levy was created a [[life peer]] by Blair in 1997, and in 2002, just prior to the Iraq War, Blair appointed Levy as his personal envoy to the [[Middle East]]. Levy has praised Blair for his "solid and committed support of the State of Israel"<ref>[http://www.jewishcare.org/events/ Jewish Care], Fundraising Dinner 2006 </ref> and has been described himself as "a leading international [[Zionist]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2092803,00.html |title=Lord Cashpoint's touch of money magic |date=[[2006-03-19]] |last=Wavell |first=Stuart |publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref> In 2004, Blair was heavily criticised by 50 former diplomats, including ambassadors to [[Baghdad]] and [[Tel Aviv]] for his policy on the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] and the Iraq War. They stated they had "''watched with deepening concern''" at Britain following the U.S. into war in Iraq in 2003 also stating, "''We feel the time has come to make our anxieties public, in the hope that they will be addressed in parliament and will lead to a fundamental reassessment,''" and asked Blair to exert "''real influence as a loyal ally''". The ambassadors also accused the allies of having "''no effective plan''" for the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq and the apparent disregard for the lives of Iraqi civilians. The diplomats also criticised Blair for his support for the [[Road map for peace|road map]] which included the retaining of [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] on the [[West Bank]] stating, "''Our dismay at this backward step is heightened by the fact that you yourself seem to have endorsed it, abandoning the principles which for nearly four decades have guided international efforts to restore peace in the Holy Land''".<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,11538,1203898,00.html Diplomats attack Blair's Israel policy], [[Guardian Unlimited]], [[Matthew Tempest]], [[April 26]], [[2004]]</ref> 

In 2006, Blair was heavily criticised for his failure to call for a ceasefire in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]], with members of his [[cabinet]] openly criticising Israel. [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and former [[Foreign Secretary]] stated that Israel's actions risked destabilising all of Lebanon and that it was "''very difficult to understand the kind of military tactics used by Israel''", "''These are not surgical strikes but have instead caused death and misery amongst innocent civilians.''". [[The Observer]] newspaper claimed that at a cabinet meeting before Blair left for a summit with President George Bush on [[July 28]], [[2006]], a significant number of ministers pressured Blair to publicly criticise Israel over the scale of deaths and destruction in Lebanon.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1833538,00.html Cabinet in open revolt over Blair's Israel policy], [[The Observer]], [[July 30]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Relationship with Labour party===
Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure has been criticised by the British press and members of parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election.<ref name=independent-09-04-06/> Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.<ref name=independent-09-04-06>{{cite news|title='Deluded': Extraordinary attack on Blair by Cabinet |date=[[2006-09-04]] |publisher=[[The Independent]]|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece}}</ref> Upon his return from his holiday in [[Caribbean|the West Indies]] he announced that all the speculation about his leaving must stop. This stirred not only his traditional critics but also traditional party loyalists.

While the Blair government has introduced social policies supported by the left of the Labour Party, such as the [[minimum wage]] and measures to reduce [[Poverty|child poverty]], Blair is seen on economic and management issues as being to the right of much of the party. A possible comparison may be made with [[United States of America|American]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] such as [[Joe Lieberman]], who have been accused by their party's "base" of adopting their opponents' political stances. Some critics describe Blair as a reconstructed [[neoconservative]] or [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]]. He is occasionally described as "Son of Thatcher", though [[Margaret Thatcher|Lady Thatcher]] herself rejected this identification in an interview with [[ITV1]] on the night of the 2005 election, saying that in her opinion the resemblances were superficial. Blair himself has often expressed admiration for Thatcher.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050213/ai_n9724446 Life without Margaret Thatcher], Didcock, Barry, ''[[The Sunday Herald]]'', February 13, 2005</ref>
===Relationship with Rupert Murdoch===
Before the 1997 general election Blair met with [[Rupert Murdoch]] owner of the [[News Corporation]] and therefore owner of [[The Sun]], [[News of the World]], [[The Times]] and the [[Sunday Times]]. It was agreed that Murdoch's papers would support Labour in return for Blair doing nothing to hurt Murdoch's business interests.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} However Blair was mostly certain to win in 1997 <U+2014> so unpopular was the Conservative government at the time <U+2014> and therefore the Sun's notorious influence was more than likely not a 'kingmaker'. Some have argued that it was Murdoch who needed Blair's support, and not the other way around.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

===Approval rating===
In May 2006, the [[Daily Telegraph]] reported that Blair's personal approval rating had dipped to just 26 per cent, lower than [[Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson's]] rating after devaluation of the pound and [[James Callaghan|James Callaghan's]] during the [[Winter of Discontent]], meaning that Blair had become the most unpopular post-war Labour Prime Minister. Of all [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]], only [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] have recorded lower approval (the former in the aftermath of the [[Poll Tax Riots]]). Previously Blair had achieved the highest approval ratings of any British Prime Minister of either party in the months following his election in 1997.
