'''Gaius Pontius''', sometimes called as '''Gavius Pontius''' or simply '''Pontius''', was a [[Samnium|Samnite]] commander during the [[Second Samnite War]]. He is most well known for his victory over the [[Roman legions]] at the [[Battle of the Caudine Forks]] in [[321 BCE]].  He was eventually captured and [[execution|executed]] by [[Fabius Maximus Rullianus]].

== Early Command ==

Gaius Pontius was a Meddix, a Samnite position similar to a Roman [[Consul]] or [[Magistratus]] at the beginning of the Second Samnite War. He controlled a force of nearly 9,000, including nearly 1000 [[cavalry]]men. With this force, he won a series of early victories, which included taking the towns of [[Canusium]] and [[Gnaitha]], and defeating the army under the command of [[Cornelius Lentulus]]. The Samnites failed to take advantage of these victories, however, and the Romans continued to press into Samnite territory.

== Battle of the Caudine Forks ==

In 321 BCE, the Romans were moving into [[Samnium]], and Pontius, who was encamped at [[Montesarchio|Caudium]], discovered that the army led by the Roman Consuls was near the town of [[Calatia]]. He devised a plan to trap the [[Roman army]], and quickly sent ten shepherds to the Roman encampment. They told the Romans that the Samnite army was laying siege to the town of [[Luceria]], in the region of [[Apulia]]. 

The Romans fell for his trap, and found themselves cornered by the Samnite army in a narrow pass. They were forced to surrender to Pontius.

== Aftermath ==

As recorded by Livy, Pontius was confused as to what should become of the Roman army which had surrendered to him. He sent a letter to his father, the Samnite statesman [[Herennius Pontius]], and the reply was that he should free them all, and therefore make Rome an ally. Pontius did not like this idea, and sent another letter to his father, saying so. Herennius, in a seemingly hypocritical manner, told his son to execute the entire army, saying that it would destroy the threat of Rome for a long time. Pontius knew that the number of Romans were simply too large to have them all executed, so he sent for his father in person, and asked him if there was a middle road. Herennius advised his son not to take that road, as it would not only humiliate the Romans, but leave them with the means to carry out revenge. 

Pontius ended up ignoring his father's advice and forcing the Romans to walk under a yoke composed of Roman [[spear]]s. This was supreme humiliation, as it was seen as cowardly for a Roman soldier to lose his spear, and the army went back to Rome smarting but intact. 

Rome's revenge was swift, and ended up with the Samnites being soundly defeated, and Pontius being executed years after the battle.

== Legacy ==

During the Second Samnite War, the Romans adopted the [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] system of military organization, which the Pontius and the Samnites used throughout the conflict. 

Gaius Pontius may be an ancestor of [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[List of Kings of Judea#Roman Prefects and Procurators of Iudaea Province (AD 6<U+2013>132)|Prefect]] of the province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] and judge at the [[trial]] of [[Jesus]], thus being the ancestor of the Gens Pontia, who also gave [[Roman consul]]s [[Marcus Pontius Sabinus]], [[Marcus Pontius Laelianus]] and ... Pontius Proculus Pontianus.
