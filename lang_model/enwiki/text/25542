'''Pennsylvania Route 405''' (designated by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] as SR 0405) is a [[state highway]] that runs for {{convert|28.05|mi|km}} in north central [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The southern terminus of [[Pennsylvania Route 147]] in [[West Chillisquaque Township, Pennsylvania|West Chillisquaque Township]]. The route heads northward along the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] through [[Milton, Pennsylvania|Milton]], [[Watsontown, Pennsylvania|Watsontown]] and [[Muncy, Pennsylvania|Muncy]] until entering [[Hughesville, Pennsylvania|Hughesville]], where it terminates at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 220]].  

Route 405 originates as the '''Muncy and Hughesville Plank Road''', a {{convert|5|mi|km}} [[plank road]] from Muncy to Hughesville, created in 1853. The plank road also consisted of a bridge over the [[Muncy Canal]] on the outskirts of the community. Route 405 was assigned in 1941, after switching between  numerous designations, including alignments of [[U.S. Route 15]], [[U.S. Route 111]], [[U.S. Route 220]], and [[U.S. Route 711]]. The alignment of Route 405 was extended to its current southern terminus when Route 147 was realigned onto a new highway. As part of the Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project, PA 405 will continue south from its current southern terminus, replacing the stretch of [[Pennsylvania Route 147|PA 147]] until its junction with [[Pennsylvania Route 61|PA 61]] in Sunbury, its new southern terminus.  PA 147 will have an alternate route between those two junctions and will not be duplexed with PA 405 at any point.

=== Old roads ===
The short alignment of Route 405 from Muncy to Hughesville contains the most of the highway's history. The bridge over the West Branch of the Susquehanna River was originally privately maintained, with the charter for its construction coming down from the [[Pennsylvania State Legislature]] on March 13, 1835.<ref name="digest">{{cite book|last=Beitel|first=Calvin Gustavus|title=A digest of titles of corporations chartered by the legislature of Pennsylvania, between the years 1700 and 1873 inclusive: giving the dates of acts of incorporation, with the several supplements thereto, with a reference to the pages of the pamphlet laws, where they may be found|publisher=J.

The canal was constructed in 1848 by a privately-maintained company for $3,000 (1848 USD). The bridge over the canal that currently uses Route 405 was constructed in 1854 at a cost of $27,000 (1854 USD), nine times the amount to construct the canal. The portion of Route 405 from Muncy to Hughesville was also chartered in 1853, consisting of a plank road between the two towns.<ref name="muncy">{{cite book|last=Meginness|first=John Franklin|title=Otzinachson|publisher=John Meginness|date=1857|pages=423|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GCNQ5Ey-3KcC&pg=PA423&lpg=PA423&dq=Muncy+and+Hughesville+Plank+Road&source=bl&ots=UUn7HzEg0j&sig=LkTkhG-P6dtSRqEzXwBL_0AQTns&hl=en&ei=2xh7SsTOKJGsNq3VxdkC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref>

=== Designation ===
[[Image:US 711.svg|right|thumb|150px|U.S. Route 711 was signed on a small piece of Route 405 from 1926 to 1928]]
On May 31, 1911, the state of Pennsylvania signed the [[Sproul Road Bill]], which started a drastic state takeover of highways. Originally, only several routes were assigned around the state. The stretch of Route 405 from the southern terminus to the current day intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 44]] was designated as Legislative Route 18. The portion of Route 405 along the Route 44 concurrency to Delwart was designated as Legislative Route 240 (most of this alignment is Route 44). The stretch from Delwart to Montgomery was not designated in 1911. From Montgomery to Muncy, Route 405 follows more of Legislative Route 240. After Muncy, Route 405 follows Legislative Route 19 until the current terminus in Hughesville.<ref name="1911state">{{cite map|title=Map of State Roads|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|year=1911|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1911.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref>

When the switch was made in 1924 from the old highway system in Pennsylvania, the alignment of Route 405 was designated as [[Pennsylvania Route 4 (1920s)|Pennsylvania Legislative Route 4]] from the community of Chillisquaque to  the intersection with the [[Susquehanna Trail]]. Route 4 was designated in 1925 along the main alignment of the Susquehanna Trail.<ref name="1924sign">{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm|title=U.S. Route 22 - The William Penn Highway|date=2009|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name="1925map">{{cite map|title=Map Showing Pennsylvania State Highway Routes|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|date=1925|cartography=Pennsylvania Department of Highways}}</ref> The route designation remained in place for a short time.

=== Involvement with Route 147 ===
Route 405 currently has its southern terminus at Route 147 in the community of Chillisquaque. Near that  intersection, Route 147 turns into a super-2 freeway towards [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. The Central Susquehanna Transportation Project is proposing to extend the super-two freeway alignment of PA 147 on a new freeway along the opposite side of the Susquehanna. The designation of Route 405 is proposed to be extended over the non-freeway alignment of Route 147 down to an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 61]] in [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]. An interchange with Route 405 would also be constructed.<ref name="rt147">{{cite web|url=http://www.csvt.com/maps/potential%20roadway%20designations.pdf|title=Proposed Roadway Route Designations|date=2009|publisher=Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> The {{convert|12|mi|km|abbrv=on}} long project will also involve a realignment of U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 15 onto the new alignment as well, a proposal that lost funding in the 1970s.<ref name="carney">{{cite news|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/pa10_carney/oberstarvisit.html|title=Oberstar: I Am Very Optimsitc About This Project|last=Carney|first=Christopher P.|date=July 17, 2007|publisher=Office of Christopher P.

== Route description ==
[[File:Watsontown main drag.jpg|right|thumb|The stretch of Route 405 and Route 44 through Watsontown]]
=== Route 147 to Watsontown ===
Route 405 begins at an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 147]] in [[Chillisquaque, Pennsylvania|Chillisquaque]]. The route heads to the northwest, heading along a parallel to Route 147 near rural farms and houses. The route reaches the center of Chillisquaque, where it turns westward for a distance through an isolated area along the [[West Branch of the Susquehanna River]]. The route meets the shoreline, where Route 405 turns to the northwest along a rural, unpopulated stretch of Chillisquaque Township. The route heads northward, crossing through a deep patch of forests. A short distance later, the forests dissipate, and Route 405 intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 45]] (the Purple Heart Highway) just across the river from [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|Lewisburg]]. Route 405 continues northward along the Susquehanna River, intersecting with a former alignment of Route 45 a short distance later. The route continues through the rural farmland along the river, entering the small community of [[East Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|East Lewisburg]]. North of East Lewisburg, Route 405 passes a large farmland plot before leaving the shoreline of the Susquehanna West Branch. The route continues northward a short distance from the Susquehanna River before entering the community of [[Milton, Pennsylvania|Milton]].

At the merge, Route 405 enters the community of [[Watsontown, Pennsylvania|Watsontown]].<ref name="yahoo" />

=== Watsontown to Hughesville ===

After entering Watsontown, Route 405 passes the local memorial park and intersects with [[Pennsylvania Route 44]] (South Main Street). Route 405 and Route 44 become concurrent along Main Street into downtown Watsontown. The two highways continue several blocks from the Susquehanna River, intersecting with Brimmer Avenue. The surroundings of the highways are highly populated, and the two routes continue in Watsontown until an intersection with East 11th Street, when the two roads leave the community. Routes 405 and 44 continue northward, intersecting with with local roads in a rural region north of Watsontown. The highways continue, entering the community of [[Dewart, Pennsylvania|Dewart]], where Route 44 turns to the west towards the Susquehanna West Branch.
