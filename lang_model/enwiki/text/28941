H. Asquith]] (1908<U+2013>1916). Helena Bonham Carter's maternal grandfather, [[Eduardo Propper de Callej<U+00F3>n]], was of half [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and half [[Jew]]ish ancestry, and served as a [[diplomacy|diplomat]] and former Minister-Counsellor at the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Bonham Carter's [[Jew]]ish maternal grandmother, H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Fould-Springer, was the daughter of Baron Eug<U+00E8>ne Fould-Springer (a French-born banker), and Marie Cecile Von Springer (whose father was the industrialist Baron Gustav Springer).<ref name="guardi1"/><ref name="08ref1">{{cite news|last=Frazer |first=Jenni |title=How Helena's grandfather was finally recognised as a true hero |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle |date=2009-02-08 |url=http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m11&SecId=11&AId=57933&ATypeId=1 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Barber |first=Lynn |title=Helena Bonham Carter: Couldn't she just wear a babygro? |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=1997-04-20 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/Observer/0,,44062,00.html |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Fould-Springer's sister was the French philanthropist Liliane de Rothschild (1916<U+2013>2003), the wife of Baron [[<U+00C9>lie de Rothschild]], and her other sister, Therese Fould-Springer, was the mother of British writer [[David Pryce-Jones]].<ref name="08ref1"/>

Bonham Carter is also distantly related to Admiral [[Stuart Bonham Carter]], [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[James Bond]] novels (through marriage), pioneering English nurse [[Florence Nightingale]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Luminaries: Famous People from the Area|publisher=Buriton Heritage Bank |date=June 2001 |url=http://www.buriton.org.uk/bhb/infosheet05.htm|accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref> and is the grand-niece of [[Anthony Asquith]], legendary [[England|English]] [[Film director|director]] of such classics as ''[[Carrington VC]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. Bonham Carter was educated at the [[South Hampstead High School]], a girls' [[independent school]] in [[Hampstead]], London and later at [[Westminster School]], a co-educational independent school near the [[Palace of Westminster]]. Bonham Carter was denied admission to [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge University]], not because of her grades or her test scores, but because school officials were afraid that she would leave mid-term to pursue her acting career. Because of Cambridge's rejection, Bonham Carter decided to concentrate fully on acting.

When Bonham Carter was just five, her mother had a serious [[nervous breakdown]], from which it took her three years to recover. Upon her recovery, her experience in therapy led her to become a [[psychotherapist]] herself <U+2014> Bonham Carter now pays her to read her [[Screenplay|scripts]] and deliver her opinion of the characters' [[psychological]] motivations. Five years after her mother's recovery, there was a more terrible familial blow. While holidaying in [[Greece]], her father went [[deaf]] in one ear. He was diagnosed with [[acoustic neuroma]], and a routine operation was carried out to remove the benign [[tumour]]. It went badly wrong. After 9 hours in surgery, Raymond, only 50 years of age, had a [[stroke]] that left him half-[[paralysed]] and confined to a [[wheelchair]]. With her two older brothers (both now bankers) at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She would later study her father's movements and mannerisms for her role in ''[[The Theory of Flight]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Helena Bonham Carter Biography |publisher=Tiscali |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/helena_bonham_carter_biog.html |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

Bonham Carter did not receive any formal training in [[acting]].<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XYOLEDXNAVCKRQFIQMFCFFOAVCBQYIV0?xml=/arts/2001/08/02/tlape02.xml&page=2 |title=Zen and the inner ape |work=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=2001-08-02 |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref> In 1979, she won a national [[writing]] contest and used the money to pay for her entry into the actors directory ''Spotlight''. She made her [[professional]] acting d<U+00E9>but at the age of 16, in a [[television]] commercial. She also had a part in a minor TV film ''[[A Pattern of Roses]]''.

Her first starring film role was as Lady Jane Grey in ''[[Lady Jane (film)|Lady Jane]]'' (1986) which had mixed reviews. The story reflected the troubled life of England's nine-days' Queen from her troubled adolescence and arranged marriage to her ill-fated accession and subsequent execution. Her [[breakthrough role]] was Lucy Honeychurch in ''[[A Room with a View (film)|A Room with a View]]'' which was filmed after ''Lady Jane'', but released beforehand. Bonham Carter also appeared in episodes of ''[[Miami Vice]]'' as [[Don Johnson]]'s love interest during the 1986<U+2013>87 season and then, in 1987, opposite [[Dirk Bogarde]] in ''[[The Vision (TV Movie)|The Vision]]''. Bonham Carter auditioned for the role of [[Nancy Spungen]] in ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', however she lost out to [[Chloe Webb]], and turned down the role of Bess McNeill in ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' due to the [[sexual content]]. The role went to [[Emily Watson]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/breaking.html |title=Breaking the Waves |accessdate=2008-10-07 |date=2004-01-07 |work=Deep Focus}}</ref>

These early films led to her to being typecast as a "[[corset]] queen", and "English rose," playing pre- and early 20th century characters, particularly in [[Merchant-Ivory]] films. She played Olivia in [[Trevor Nunn]]'s film version of [[Twelfth Night]] in 1996. She has since expanded her range,<ref name="telegraph"/> with her more recent films being ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', ''[[Big Fish]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''.

Bonham Carter speaks [[French language|French]] fluently, starring in a 1996 French film ''Portraits chinois''. In August 2001, she was featured in [[Maxim magazine|''Maxim'']]. She played her second Queen of England when she was cast as [[Anne Boleyn]] in the ITV1 mini-series ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]''; however her role was restricted, as she was pregnant with her first child at the time of filming. Bonham Carter was a member of the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] jury that unanimously selected ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'' as best film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gofrance.about.com/od/cannesfilmfestival/a/cannes2006jury.htm |title=Cannes Film Festival 2006 Official Juries |accessdate=2008-10-07 |date=2008-10-07 |work=Go France}}</ref>
