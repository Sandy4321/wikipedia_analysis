The '''three-toed sloths''' are the only members of the '''''Bradypus''''' genus and the '''Bradypodidae''' family.  Although similar to the somewhat larger and generally faster moving [[two-toed sloth]]s, the two genera are not particularly closely related.<ref name=xen3>{{cite web | url = http://xenarthra.org/sloth/bradypus/ | title = 3-Toed Sloths | accessdate = 2007-04-09}}</ref> Both types of [[sloth]] tend to occupy the same forests: in most areas, a particular single species of three-toed sloth and a single species of the larger two-toed type will jointly predominate.  Famously slow-moving, the sloth travels at a top speed of 0.15 mph.<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.html</ref>
==Characteristics==
Three-toed sloths are about the size of a small [[dog]], with the head and body having a combined length of around 60 centimeters, and the animal having a weight of 3.5-4.5 kg (or between 7 and 10 lbs). Unlike the two-toed sloths, they also have a short (6-7 cm) tail, and they have three clawed toes on all four of their limbs. Three-toed sloths are sporadically active both day and night, typically for about 10-11 hours out of every 24.<ref name=EoM/> 

They feed almost exclusively on leaves, and, like their two-toed cousins, have a complex, multi-chambered stomach to ferment tough vegetable matter. They move between different trees up to four times a day, although they prefer to keep to a particular type of tree, which varies between individuals, perhaps as a means of allowing multiple sloths to occupy overlapping home ranges without competing with each other.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Dickman, Christopher R.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 776-779|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref> Three-toed sloths have no [[incisor]] or [[canine (tooth)|canine]] teeth, just a set of peg-shaped cheek teeth that are not clearly divided into [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, giving them the unusually simple [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{dentition2|0.0.5|0.0.4-5}}

The three-toed sloth, unlike most other mammals, does not maintain a constant body temperature, being closer to a [[reptile]] in this respect. Because its body temperature goes down as the air temperature goes down, the three-toed sloth is only able to live in humid and warm environments.

Females give birth a single young after a [[gestation]] period of around six months. They are [[weaning|weaned]] at about one month of age, but remain with the mother for several further months. Adults are solitary, and mark their territories using anal [[scent gland]]s and dung middens.<ref name=EoM/>

==Habitat==
Previously, three-toed sloths were believed to have lived only in ''[[Cecropia]]'' trees, locally known as [[Embauba]] trees. Recent studies indicate that they also reside in at least 96 other tree species. The original assumption was skewed because the ''Cecropia'' trees have a relatively open canopy, making it  easier to observe a sloth in these trees.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}
