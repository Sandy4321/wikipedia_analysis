The Kouga Dam(''known as Paul Sauer Dam prior to 1995''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/untpdc/incubator/africahp/zaf/za7.htm|title=FRESH WATER and MARINE RESOURCES|accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref>) supplies irrigations water to the Kouga and Gamtoos valleys as well as drinking water to the [[Port Elizabeth]] metropolitan area via the [[Lourie, South Africa]] balancing dam.<ref>[http://www.baviaans.net/kougadam.html Gamtoos Tourism]</ref>

[[Image:South Africa-Paul Sauer Dam04.jpg|thumb|Access to the dam wall is via a short tunnel]]
The dam can be accessed by following  the R330 and then the R331 from the N2 at [[Humansdorp]]. All but the last 4km is tarred road and there is a short tunnel just before the dam wall.

==Power plant==
There are three 1200 kVA hydroelectric turbines at the base of the dam, but they are currently not in use.
