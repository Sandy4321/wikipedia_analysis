As a top aide of [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Chairman]] [[Yasser Arafat]], al-Wazir had considerable influence in Fatah's military activities, eventually becoming the commander of Fatah's armed wing [[al-Assifa]]. The majority of Palestinians viewed him as a [[martyr]] who died resisting the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]] or at least sympathized with his cause,<ref>Connel, Dan.

Al-Wazir became a [[Palestinian refugee|refugee]] when his family was expelled from Ramla during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], and began leading a minor ''[[Palestinian fedayeen|fedayeen]]'' force in the [[Gaza Strip]]. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with [[Communism|Communist]] regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in [[Algeria]]. He played an important role in the 1970<U+2013>71 [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] clashes in [[Jordan]], by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the [[Jordanian Army]], al-Wazir joined the PLO in [[Lebanon]].

Prior to and during [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon]], al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both civilian and military targets. He prepared [[Beirut]]'s defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon with the rest of the Fatah leadership. He settled in [[Amman]] for a two-year period and was then exiled to [[Tunis]] in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the [[Palestinian territories]]; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the [[First Intifada]]. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.

{{further|1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle}}
Khalil al-Wazir was born in 1935 to [[Sunni Islam|Muslim]] parents in the city of [[Ramla]], [[Palestine]], then under [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandatory]] rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city.<ref name="Cobban">{{cite book |last=Cobban |first=Helena |authorlink=Helena Cobban | title=The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power, and Politics |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-27216-5 |page=8 }}</ref><ref name="Enotes">[http://www.enotes.com/salem-history/khalil-al-wazir Khalil al-Wazir Biography: Article abstract] ENotes Incorporate.</ref> Al-Wazir and his family were [[1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle|expelled]] in July 1948, along with another 50,000<U+2013>70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following [[Israel]]'s [[Operation Danny|capture of the area]] during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.<ref name=Morris2004p425>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA425 Morris 2004, p. 425].</ref> They settled in the [[Bureij (camp)|Bureij]] refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by [[UNRWA]].<ref>"Wazir, Khalil Ibrahim al-."

In 1954 he came into contact with [[Yasser Arafat]] in [[Gaza City|Gaza]]; al-Wazir would become Arafat's right-hand man later in his life. During his time in Gaza, al-Wazir became a member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood]],<ref name="Aburish">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

==Formation of Fatah==
Al-Wazir used his time in Kuwait to further his ties with Arafat and other fellow Palestinian exiles he had met in Egypt. He and his comrades founded [[Fatah]], a secular [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian nationalist]] guerrilla and political organization, sometime between 1959<U+2013>60.<ref name="Aburish2">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

He settled in [[Algeria]] in 1962, after a delegation of Fatah leaders, including Arafat and [[Farouk Kaddoumi]], were invited there by [[President of Algeria|Algerian President]] [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Al-Wazir remained there, opened a Fatah office and military training camp in [[Algiers]] and was included in an Algerian-Fatah delegation to [[Beijing]] in 1964.<ref name="Cobban2">{{cite book |last=Cobban |first=Helena | authorlink=Helena Cobban |title=The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power, and Politics |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=31<U+2013>32 |isbn=0-521-27216-5 }}</ref> During his visit, he presented Fatah's ideas to various leaders of the People's Republic of China, including premier [[Zhou Enlai]],<ref name="PASSIA">[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/chronology/19631988.htm Palestine Facts: 1963<U+2013>1988] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]] (PASSIA)</ref> and thus inaugurated Fatah's good relationship with China.

===Syria and post-Six-Day War===
Al-Wazir and the Fatah leadership settled in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in 1965, in order take advantage of the large number of [[Palestine Liberation Army]] (PLA) members there. On May 9, 1966, he and Arafat were detained by Syrian police loyal to air marshal [[Hafez al-Assad]] after an incident where a pro-Syrian Palestinian leader, [[Yusuf Orabi]] was thrown out of the window of a three-story building and killed. Al-Wazir and Arafat were either considering uniting Fatah with Orabi's faction<U+2014>the Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine<U+2014>or winning Orabi's support against Arafat's rivals within the Fatah leadership. An argument occurred, eventually leading to Orabi's murder; however, al-Wazir and Arafat had already left the scene shortly before the incident. According to Aburish, Orabi and Assad were "close friends" and Assad appointed a panel to investigate what happened. The panel found both Arafat and al-Wazir guilty, but  [[Salah Jadid]], then Deputy Secretary-General of the [[President of Syria]], pardoned them.<ref name="Aburish2"/>

After the defeat of a coalition of Arab states in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored by any of the involved Arab states, such as the [[Arab Nationalist Movement]] led by [[George Habash]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Army]] of [[Ahmad Shukeiri]], lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the [[Battle of Karameh]], in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist.<ref name="Aburish3">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

He was also put in charge of [[guerrilla warfare]] operations in both the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied Palestinian territories]] and Israel proper.<ref name="Cobban"/><ref name="Shashaa"/>

==Black September and the Lebanon War==

During the [[Black September in Jordan|Black September clashes]] in Jordan, al-Wazir supplied the encircled Palestinian forces in [[Jerash]] and [[Ajlun]] with arms and aid,<ref name="Mattar"/>  but the conflict was decided in Jordan's favor. After Arafat and thousands of Fatah fighters retreated to [[Lebanon]], al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between [[King Hussein]] and the PLO's leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan.<ref name="Aburish4">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

Al-Wazir did not play a major role in the [[Lebanese Civil War]]; he confined himself primarily to strengthening the [[Lebanese National Movement]], the PLO's main ally in the conflict.<ref name="Mattar">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of the Palestinians (Facts on File Library of World History) |encyclopedia=[[Phillip Mattar]] |volume=1 |publisher=Facts on File |year=2000 }} Excerpt provided by palestineremembered.com [http://www.palestineremembered.com/al-Ramla/al-Ramla/Story175.html al-Wazir, Khalil]</ref> During the [[Tel al-Zaatar massacre|fall of the Tel al-Zaatar camp]] to the [[Lebanese Front]], al-Wazir blamed himself for not organizing a rescue effort.<ref name="Abu Jihad5">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

During his time in Lebanon, al-Wazir was responsible for coordinating high-profile operations. He allegedly planned the [[Savoy Operation]] in 1975, in which eight Fatah militants raided and took hostages in the Savoy hotel in [[Tel Aviv]], killing eight of them, as well as three Israeli soldiers.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/AS1.htm Terrorist Suicide Operation Analysis: Savoy Operation] GlobalSecurity, 2005-04-27</ref> The [[Coastal Road massacre]], in March 1978, was also planned by al-Wazir.

When [[Siege of Beirut|Israel besieged Beirut]] in 1982, al-Wazir, disagreed with the PLO's leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that the PLO pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0377-919X(198524)14%3A2%3C3%3AKA(JT1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad): The 17th Palestine National Council] ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 14, No. 2, Special Issue: The Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Territories (Winter, 1985), pp. 3<U+2013>12</ref> PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, with most of the leadership relocating to [[Tunis]], although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.<ref name="PASSIA"/><ref name="Abu Jihad">{{cite book |last=Aburish |first=Said K. |authorlink=Said K.

==Establishing a movement in the Palestinian territories==
Dissatisfied at the decisive defeat of Palestinian forces during the 1982 Lebanon War, al-Wazir concentrated on establishing a solid Fatah base in the Palestinian territories. In 1982, he began to sponsor youth committees in the territories. These organizations would grow and initiate the [[First Intifada]] in December 1987 (the word ''Intifada'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], literally translated as "shaking off", is generally used to describe an uprising or revolt).

The Intifada began as an uprising of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<ref name="Intifada"/> On June 7, 1986, about a year before the Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from [[Amman]] to [[Baghdad]], eventually moving to [[Tunisia]] days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] between Jordan and the PLO were over.<ref name="PASSIA"/>

The first stage of the Intifada was a response to an incident at the [[Erez Crossing|Erez checkpoint]], where an Israeli military vehicle hit a group of Palestinian laborers, killing four of them. However, within weeks, following persistent requests by al-Wazir, the PLO attempted to direct the uprising, which lasted until 1991, or 1993, according to various authorities. Al-Wazir had been assigned by Arafat the responsibility of the Palestinian territories within the PLO command. According to author [[Said Aburish]], he had "impressive knowledge of local conditions" in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], apparently knowing "every village, school, and large family in Gaza and the West Bank". He provided the uprising with financial backing and logistical support, thus becoming its "brain in exile." Al-Wazir activated every cell he had set up in the territories since the late 1970s in an effort to militarily back the stone-throwers who formed the backbone of the Palestinian revolt. He also used the opportunity to reform the PLO.<ref name="Intifada"/> According to author [[Yezid Sayigh]], al-Wazir believed that the Intifada should not have been sacrificed to Arafat solely for use as a diplomatic or political tool.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sayigh |first=Yezid |title=Armed Struggle and the Search for State, the Palestinian National Movement, 1949<U+2013>1993 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=0-19-829643-6 |page=618 }}</ref>

==Assassination==
Al-Wazir was assassinated in his home in [[Tunis]] at 2 a.m. [[UTC]] on April 16, 1988 at the age of 52. He was shot at close range multiple times in the presence of his wife and son Nidal.<ref name="Intifada"/> Al-Wazir was assassinated by an [[Sayeret|Israeli commando]] team, reportedly ferried from Israel by boat, aided ashore by [[Mossad]] intelligence operatives, and using the IDs of Lebanese fisherman who had been kidnapped to gain access to the PLO compound.<ref>Anita Vitullo, 'Uprising in Gaza,' in Zachery Lockman, Joel Beinin (eds.), ''Intifada: The Palestinian Uprising Against Israeli Occupation,''South End Press, p.50.</ref> Israel accused al-Wazir of escalating the violence of the Intifada, which was ongoing at the time of his assassination.<ref name="Intifada"/> Specifically, he was believed to be the architect of the triple bomb attack at a shopping mall. He was buried in the [[Yarmouk (camp)|Yarmouk refugee camp]] in [[Damascus]] on April 21;<ref name="PASSIA"/> Arafat led the funeral procession.<ref name="Intifada"/>

In 1997, the ''[[Maariv]]'' newspaper reported on the assassination of al-Wazir. The report claimed that [[Ehud Barak]] led a seaborne command center on a navy [[missile boat]] off the shore of Tunis that oversaw al-Wazir's assassination. Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak declined to comment on the issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, as well as the army's [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|intelligence branch]], the [[Israeli Air Force|air force]], [[Israeli Sea Corps|navy]] and the elite [[Sayeret Matkal]] commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51b/001.html|title=Barak Assassination of Abu Jihad |accessdate=2008-02-12|last=Ackerman |first=Gwen |date=1997-07-04|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Hartford Web Publishing}}</ref> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on 21 April that the [[Israeli cabinet]] approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.<ref name="PASSIA"/>

In 2013, Israel unofficially confirmed that it was responsible for his assassination, after an interview by Israeli correspondent [[Ronen Bergman]] of Nahum Lev, the [[Sayeret Matkal]] officer who led the raid, was cleared for publication - its release had been blocked by military censors for more than a decade. In that interview, Lev gave Bergman a detailed account of the operation.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-admits-to-top-secret-operation-that-killed-top-fatah-commander-abu-jihad-in-1988/ 24 years later, Israel acknowledges top-secret operation that killed Fatah terror chief]</ref>

The [[United States Department of State]] condemned his killing as an "act of political assassination",<ref name="Chomsky"/> and the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 611|Resolution 611]] condemning "the aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia", without specifically mentioning Israel.<ref name="Resolution611">[http://freepalestine.com/Summary%20of%20Security%20Council%20Resolutions%20on%20Palestine%20since%201948.htm List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Israel]</ref>

==Personal life==

They had three sons, named Jihad, Bassem and Nidal, and two daughters, named Iman and Hanan al-Wazir.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DF1331F937A3575BC0A962958260 For Gazan, Her Return Breeds Hope] Greenburg, Joel.

After [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip]] in 2007, Palestinian looters raided al-Wazir's home, reportedly stealing his personal belongings.
