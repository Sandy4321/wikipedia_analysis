Since their origin in 2005, ''Pan-Pot'' have established their presence in the modern Techno scene reaching popularity with the release of their debut album, '''Pan-O-Rama'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Pan-Pot|url=http://www.mobilee-records.de/artists/pan-pot|publisher=Mobilee Records|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref>  on ''Anja Schneider'' 's <ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Anja Schneider|url=http://dj-rankings.com/DJ-ANJA_SCHNEIDER|publisher=Official DJ Rankings|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>''Mobilee records'' <ref>{{cite web|title=Pan Pot releases the debut album|url=http://beatfactor.net/news/539/pan-pot-releases-the-debut-album.html|publisher=Beatfactor|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pan Pot|url=http://www.bartist.net/pan-pot/|publisher=Bartist|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>.

Their music repertoire is best defined as [[underground|Underground]] oriented as well as independent from any existing genres of contemporary sounds, traversing Techno, House and yet experimental elements with strong [[IDM]] influences.

The duo is credited with producing live sets combined with vocals <ref>{{cite web|last=Lavin|first=Polly|title=<U+201C>Pan-Pot's first ever live performance of depth filled dark techno is industrious, rolling percussion and piercing melodies over driving bass that come in onslaught<U+201D>|url=http://www.ibiza-voice.com/story/news/3367|publisher=Ibiza- voice|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Taufen|first=Amber|title=German techno duo Pan-Pot will experiment at NORAD|url=www.westword.com/2013-01-17/music/pan-pot-techno-norad/full/|publisher=Denver Westword Music|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>, which are described to reveal a deep understanding of clubs and festivals' dancefloor<U+2019>s needs <ref>{{cite web|title=Sat. 18-08-2012 Fuse presents Pan-Pot|url=http://www.fuse.be/fuse/?p=10575|publisher=Fuse.be|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Artist: Pan-Pot|url=http://igloofest.ca/en/events/2013/artists/154-pan-pot|publisher=Igloofest|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>.  


== History ==

In 2003 Tassilo and Thomas met at Berlin<U+2019>s [[SAE Institute]] to study [[audio engineering]]. There the two producers completed  their studies in [[audio engineer|sound production]] and design, which helped them in defining ''Pan-Pot''' s sound aesthetic by starting producing music together <ref>{{cite web|last=Kec|first=Anna|title=Pan-Pot Interview - Electronic Music|url=http://analogik.com/articles/20887/pan-pot-interview|publisher=Analogick.com|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>.

In 2005 the duo booked Anja Schneider at one of their events <ref>{{cite web|title=Pan-Pot: The Documentary|url=http://news.beatport.com/blog/2012/02/14/pan-pot-the-documentary-trailer/|publisher=Beatport|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>, which coincidently gave them the opportunity to establish a favorable connection with her at the time nascent ''Mobilee'' imprint. 
After few weeks the label launched their second release which was ''Pan-Pot''<U+2019>s official debut ''"Copy and Paste"'' <ref>{{cite web|title=Pan-Pot Interview|url=http://analogik.com/articles/20887/pan-pot-interview|publisher=Analogick|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>. 
Since then a steady stream of tracks and remixes were released on ''Mobilee'' and ''Einmaleins Musik''.

The defining moment of ''Pan-Pot''<U+2019>s career came in 2007 with the release of their debut artist album, ''Pan-O-Rama''<ref>{{cite news|title=Pan-Pot Releases on Pan-O-Rama|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=8828|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=RA News}}</ref>. Tracks like ''"Charly"'' and ''"Captain My Captain"'' became hits, which made the artists known for their blend of melodic, plain Techno and House <ref>{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Dan|title=Pan-Pot: The Documentary|url=http://news.beatport.com/blog/2012/02/14/pan-pot-the-documentary-trailer/|publisher=Beatport News|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>.
