==Prelude to World War II==
Before the United States entered World War II, Hispanic Americans were already fighting on European soil in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

The Spanish Civil War was a major conflict in Spain that started after an attempted ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'' committed by parts of the [[Spanish Army|army]], led by the [[Franquism|Nationalist]] [[Francisco Franco|General Francisco Franco]], against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Hispanic Americans fought on behalf of both of the factions involved, the "Nationalists" as members of the Spanish Army and the "Loyalists" (Republicans) either as members of the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade|Abraham Lincoln International Brigade]]<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/la-mano/message/3099 Latinos who fought in Spain], Retrieved November 12, 2007</ref> or as aviators in the [[Yankee Squadron]], which was led by [[Bertrand Blanchard Acosta|Bert Acosta]] (1895 <U+2013> 1954).<ref>[http://www.aerofiles.com/bio_a.html Bert Acosta]</ref>

General [[Manuel Goded Llopis]](1882 - 1936), who was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was a high ranking officer in the Spanish Army. Llopis, was among the first generales to join [[Francisco Franco|General Francisco Franco]], in the uprising against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Llopis was sent to lead the fight against the Anarchists in [[Catalonia]], but his troops were outnumbered. He was captured and was sentenced to die by firing squad.<ref>"Richard A. H. Robinson.

==European Theater==
The [[European Theatre of World War II]] was an area of heavy fighting between the [[Allied forces]] and the [[Axis powers]] from September 1, 1939 to May 8, 1945. The majority of Hispanic Americans served in regular units; some active combat units, such as the 65th Infantry Regiment from Puerto Rico and the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|141st Regiment of the 36th Texas Infantry]], were made up mostly of Hispanics.

Hispanics of the 141st Regiment of the 36th Infantry Division were some of the first American troops to [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|land on Italian soil at Salerno]]. Company E of the 141st Regiment was entirely Hispanic. The 36th Infantry Division saw combat in Italy and France, enduring heavy casualties during the controversial crossing of the [[Rapido River]] near [[Cassino, Italy]].<ref>[http://www.hispaniconline.com/hh02/history_heritage_on_the_battlefront.html History & Heritage.

The [[Pacific Theater of Operations]] (PTO) is the term used in the United States for all military activity between the Allies and Japan, from 1937 to 1945, in the Pacific Ocean and the countries bordering it, during World War II. Three units of mostly Hispanic Americans served in the Pacific Theatre battlefields: the [[200th Coast Artillery (United States)|200th Coast Artillery]] and the 515th [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] Battalions from [[New Mexico]]<U+2014>whose members participated in the infamous [[Bataan Death March]]<U+2014>and the 158th Regimental Combat Team from [[Arizona]].

===Bataan Death March===
Two [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] units<U+2014>the 200th and the 515th Battalions<U+2014>were activated in New Mexico in 1940.

By April 9, 1942, rations, medical supplies, and ammunition became scarce; the starving and outnumbered troops the 200th and 515th Battalions laid down their arms after being given a direct order and surrendered to the Japanese.

He remembered a sense of brotherhood among the Hispanic soldiers who would march together in groups, and assisted each other along the way.
When the soldiers reached their detention center, they were forced into a 30-by-100 foot fenced area. Later, the soldiers were forced into boxcars. One hundred soldiers were crammed into a car that was built to hold 40 or 50 men. The train took the soldiers on a four-hour ride to Camp O<U+2019>Donnell where Pvt.

===158th Regimental Combat Team===
The 158th Regimental Combat Team, an [[Arizona National Guard]] unit of mostly Hispanic soldiers, also fought in the Pacific Theatre. Early in the war, the 158th<U+2014>nicknamed the "[[Bushmasters]]"<U+2014>had been deployed to protect the Panama Canal and had completed jungle training. The unit later fought the Japanese in the [[New Guinea]] area in heavy combat and was involved in the [[Philippines campaign (1944<U+2013>45)|liberation of the Philippine Islands]]. General MacArthur referred to them as "the greatest fighting combat team ever deployed for battle."<ref>[http://www.ilga.gov/house/journals/95/2007/HJ095037R.pdf House Journals] (PDF).

 |quote=The proud history of the Bushmasters dates back to 1865 when the 1st Arizona Volunteers organized to provide security in our nation<U+2019>s southwest territory.  Follow-on service included the Spanish American War, Mexican border service, and World War I in France.

As a result of the declaration of a National Emergency in 1940, the 158th Infantry mobilized again <U+2013> training in Oklahoma and Texas.  Then in 1942, following the December 7th, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the 158th Infantry Regiment disembarked to the Panama Canal Zone. 

In Panama the 158th trained in jungle warfare.  Gaining fame for their newly acquired fighting skills, the Regiment took the name <U+201C>Bushmasters<U+201D> after the deadly bushmaster snake (indigenous to the region).  The name "Bushmasters" became well-known throughout the national press and General MacArthur personally requested the 158th Infantry to serve in the Southwest Pacific Theater.

In January 1943 the Bushmasters staged in Australia.  From <U+201C>Down Under<U+201D> the 158th Infantry advanced on and fought through Goodenought Island, Arawe, Wakde-Sarmi in Dutch New Guinea, and Neomfoor engaging and defeating Japanese units of division strength. 

In 1944, the Bushmasters landed in the Philippines and received a presidential citation for their success destroying or capturing 100 Japanese artillery pieces and enabling a successful invasion of the allies -- General MacArthur "had returned."

In 1945, the 158th Infantry pressed further in the Philippines, invading southern Luzon by means of a daring naval landing craft assault hitting the Legaspi Port.

As a result of the Bushmasters<U+2019> continued success, the 158th Infantry was selected to spearhead the final invasion of Japan. The Bushmasters were under orders to proceed two days ahead of America's crushing D-Day, to silence Japanese air warning stations south of Kyushu.  Timely capitulation of Japan saved the Bushmasters from what many believed would have been a certain suicide mission. 

In October 1945, the 158th Infantry landed in Yokohama, Japan.  The great odyssey was over.  FROM ARIZONA TO JAPAN - IN FIVE YEARS!  Members were then shipped home and the 158th was deactivated at Utsunomiya, Japan in January 1946.

The [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan on August 9, 1945, but while the Allies awaited Japan<U+2019>s response to the demand to surrender, the war continued. On August 13, 1945, 1st Lt. Perdomo shot down four [[Nakajima Ki-43|Nakajima Ki-43 "Oscar"]] fighters and one [[Yokosuka K5Y|Yokosuka K5Y <U+201C>Willow<U+201D>]] Type 93 biplane trainer. This action took place near [[Seoul, Korea|Keijo/Seoul, Korea]] when 38 Thunderbolts of the 507th Fighter Wing encountered approximately 50 enemy aircraft. This action was Lt. Perdomo's tenth and final combat mission, and the five confirmed victories made him an <U+201C>Ace in a Day<U+201D> and earned him the distinction of being the last <U+201C>Ace<U+201D> of World War II. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States Army)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for extraordinary heroism in action and the [[Air Medal]] with one [[oak leaf cluster]].<ref name="Perdomo"/>

==Servicewomen==
Prior to World War II, traditional Hispanic cultural values expected women to be homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only a small number of Hispanic women joined the military before World War II.<ref name="Hispanic ServiceWomen"/> However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), predecessor of the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC), and the U.S. Navy [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]] (WAVES), women could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones.<ref name="McIntyre">McIntyre, Hannah.

Retrieved July 12, 2007.</ref> While most women who served in the military joined the WAACs, a smaller number of women served in the Naval Women<U+2019>s Reserve (the WAVES).

In 1944, the Army recruited women in Puerto Rico for the Women<U+2019>s Army Corps (WAC). Over 1,000 applications were received for the unit, which was to be composed of only 200 women. After their basic training at [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia|Fort Oglethorpe]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Puerto Rican WAC unit was assigned to the Port of Embarkation of New York City to work in military offices that planned the shipment of troops around the world; however, not all of the WAAC units were stationed in the mainland USA. In January 1943, the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company became the first WAAC unit to go overseas when they went to North Africa. Serving overseas was dangerous for women; [[Prisoner of War|if captured]], WAACs, as "auxiliaries" serving with the Army rather than in it, did not have the same protections under [[international law]] as male soldiers.<ref>Treadwell, Mattie E.

[[Image:Carmen Bozak2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Tech4 [[Carmen Contreras-Bozak]]]]
One of the members of the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company was Tech4 [[Carmen Contreras-Bozak]], who served in [[Algiers]] within General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]<U+2019>s theatre headquarters. Contreras joined the Women<U+2019>s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in 1942 and was sent to [[Fort Lee, Virginia|Fort Lee]], [[Virginia]] for training. Contreras volunteered to be part of the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company, thus becoming the first Hispanic to serve as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions. The unit was the first WAAC unit to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943.

Contreras' unit arrived in Northern Africa on January 27, 1943 and rendered overseas duties in [[Algiers]] within General Dwight D. Eisenhower<U+2019>s theatre headquarters, dealing with nightly [[Strategic bombing during World War II|German air raids]]. Contreras remembers that the women who served abroad were not treated like the regular Army servicemen. They did not receive overseas payment nor could they receive government life insurance. They had no protection if they became ill, wounded or captured. She served until 1945 and earned the [[European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]] with 2 Battle Stars, [[World War II Victory Medal]], [[American Campaign Medal]], [[Women's Army Corps Service Medal]] and the [[Army Good Conduct Medal]].<ref>[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/unit1.htm Introduction: World War II (1941<U+2013>1945).] Hispanics in the Defense of America.

===Female nurses===
[[Image:Nurses in Tortugero.jpg|thumb|right|Puerto Rican [[nurse]]s in Camp Tortuguero]]
When the United States entered World War II, the military was in need of nurses. Hispanic female nurses wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the [[Army Nurse Corps|Army]] or [[Navy Nurse Corps]].  As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment.  As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses.  In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses.  Thirteen women submitted applications, were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico.<ref name="PR Women"/> One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.
[[Image:CarmenDurnier2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|2nd Lt. [[Carmen Dumler|Carmen Lozano Dumler]]]]
Second Lieutenant [[Carmen Dumler|Carmen Lozano Dumler]] was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she also received her primary and secondary education. After graduating from high school, she enrolled in the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing in San Juan where she became a certified nurse in 1944. In August 21, 1944, she was sworn in as a [[2nd Lieutenant#United States of America|2nd Lieutenant]] and assigned to the 161st General Hospital in San Juan, where she received further training. Upon completing her advanced training, she was sent to Camp Tortuguero where she also assisted as an interpreter.

In 1945, Lozano was reassigned to the 359th Station Hospital of Ft. Read, [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]], [[British West Indies]], where she attended wounded soldiers who had returned from [[Normandy]], France. After the war, Lozano, like so many other women in the military, returned to civilian life. She continued her nursing career in Puerto Rico until she retired in 1975.<ref name="PR Women"/>

Another Hispanic nurse who distinguished herself in service was Lieutenant Maria Roach. Roach, a recipient of two Bronze Star Medals and an Air Medal, served as a flight nurse with the Army Nurse Corps in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]] of Operations.<ref name="Hispanic ServiceWomen"/>

==Senior Officers==
Most of the Hispanics serving as senior military officers during World War II were graduates of the [[United States Naval Academy]]. The three highest ranking Hispanic officers who played an instrumental role in the war were [[Major General]] (later [[Lieutenant General]]) [[Pedro Augusto del Valle]]<U+2014>the first Hispanic to reach the rank of General in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]]<U+2014>, [[Brigadier General]] (later Lieutenant General) [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Elwood R. <U+201C>Pete<U+201D> Quesada]] of the Army Air Forces and Army [[Major General]] [[Terry de la Mesa Allen (Major General)|Terry de la Mesa Allen]].

===Generals===
;Major General del Valle
[[Image:Pedro del Valle.jpg|right|thumb|Lieutenant General [[Pedro del Valle]]]]
Lieutenant General [[Pedro del Valle|Pedro Augusto del Valle]] (1893<U+2013>1978), as a Colonel was the Commanding Officer of the [[U.S. 11th Marine Regiment|11th Marine Regiment]] (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of [[Guadalcanal]], providing artillery support for the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]. In the [[Battle of the Tenaru]], the fire power provided by del Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers<U+2014>almost to the last man<U+2014>before they reached the Marine positions. As a result of the outcome of the battle Japanese commander, Colonel Ichiki Kiyonao, committed [[seppuku]] shortly afterwards. General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], impressed with del Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a Brigadier General. Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines, the only time that the 11th Marines has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as Commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, [[Tulagi]], and the [[Russell Islands|Russell]] and [[Florida Islands]].<ref name="Valle">Alexander, Joseph H.

On April 1, 1944, del Valle, as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery, [[III Marine Amphibious Corps]], took part in the [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Battle of Guam]] and was awarded a [[Gold Star]] in lieu of a second [[Legion of Merit]]. The men under his command did such a good job with their heavy artillery that no one man could be singled out for commendation. Instead each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle, which was carried in his record books.<ref name="Valle"/>

In late October 1944, del Valle succeeded Major General [[William Rupertus]] as Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division, being personally greeted to his new command by [[Chesty Puller|Colonel Lewis Burwell "Chesty" Puller]]. At the time, the 1st Marine Division was training on the island of [[Pavuvu]] for the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. On May 29, 1945, del Valle participated in one of the most important events that led to victory in Okinawa. After five weeks of fighting, del Valle ordered Company A of the [[1st Battalion 5th Marines]] to capture [[Shuri Castle]], a medieval fortress of the ancient [[Ryukyuan Kingdom|Ryukyuan kings]]. Seizure of Shuri Castle represented a morale blow for the Japanese and was a milestone in the Okinawa campaign.<ref name="Valle"/> The fighting in Okinawa would continue for 24 more days. Del Valle was awarded a [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his leadership during the battle and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa.

;Brigadier General Quesada
[[Image:Pete Quesada.jpg|left|thumb|Brig. Gen. [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Elwood R. Quesada]]]]
Lieutenant General [[Elwood R. Quesada|Elwood R. <U+201C>Pete<U+201D> Quesada]], (1904<U+2013>1993) was assigned as a [[Brigadier General]] in October 1940 to [[military intelligence|intelligence]] in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps. He became commanding general of the 9th Fighter Command where he established advanced headquarters on the [[Normandy Landings|Normandy beachhead]] on [[D-Day]] plus one, and directed his planes in aerial cover and air support for the Allied invasion of the European continent. He was the foremost proponent of "the inherent flexibility of air power", a principle he helped prove during World War II.<ref name="Quesada">[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/erquesada.htm Elwood Richard Quesada: Lieutenant General, United States Air Force.] Arlington National Cemetery. Retrieved July 10, 2007.</ref>

In December 1942, Quesada took the First Air Defense Wing to [[North Africa]]. Shortly thereafter, he was given command of the XII Fighter Command and in this capacity would work out the mechanics of [[close air support]] and Army-Air Force cooperation.<ref name="Quesada"/>

The successful integration of air and land forces in the [[Tunisia campaign]] forged by Quesada and the Allied leaders became a blueprint for operations incorporated into Army Air Forces field regulations<U+2014>FM 100-20, "Command and Employment of Air Power," first published on July 21, 1943<U+2014>and provided the Allies with their first victory in the European war. Principles such as the co-equality of ground and air force commanders, centralized command of tactical aircraft to exploit "the inherent flexibility of air power," and the attainment of air superiority over the battlefield as a prerequisite for successful ground operations formed the core of tactical air doctrine. In October 1943, Quesada assumed command of the IX Fighter Command in England, and his forces provided air cover for the [[Normandy Landings|landings on Normandy Beach]]. Among Quesada<U+2019>s many military decorations were the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] with [[oak leaf cluster]]; [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]; Purple Heart and an Air Medal with two Silver Stars.<ref name="Quesada"/>

Major General [[Terry de la Mesa Allen, Sr.]] (1888-1969) was the son of Colonel Samuel Edward Allen and Conchita Alvarez de la Mesa. During World War II he was the commanding general of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] in North Africa and Sicily, and was made commander of the [[104th Infantry Division]]. While in North Africa Allen and his deputy 1st Division Commander, Brigadier General [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]] distinguished themselves as combat leaders. Allen was re-assigned to the 104th Infantry Division. The 104th Infantry Division landed in France on September 7, 1944 and fought for 195 consecutive days during [[World War II]]. The division's nickname came from its [[Eastern Timber Wolf|timberwolf]] shoulder insignia. Some 34,000 men served with the division under Allen who came to be nicknamed "Terrible Terry". The division was particularly renowned for its night fighting prowess.<ref>[http://www.104infdiv.org/timemag.htm [[Time Magazine]] August 1943], Retrieved April 10, 2008</ref>

===Recipients of the Medal of Honor===
{{main|List of Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients}}
[[Image:Army-Navy.jpg|right|thumb|(L-R) Army and Navy (Marines) [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]]]]
The [[Medal of Honor]], sometimes referred to as the Congressional Medal of Honor, is the highest military decoration in the United States bestowed "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force." The medal is awarded by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress. [[Joe P. Martinez]] was the first of 13 Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients during World War II. His posthumous award was the first for combat heroism on American soil (other than Pearl Harbor) since the [[Indian Wars|Indian Campaigns]].<ref>[http://www.cmohs.org/medal/medal_history.htm The Medal's History.] Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Joe Martinez.jpg|left|thumb|Pvt. [[Joe P. Martinez|Joseph Pantillion Martinez]]]]
Pvt. [[Joe P. Martinez]], whose birth name was Joseph Pantillion Martinez, was one of nine children born to a family of Mexican immigrants. His family moved to [[Ault, Colorado|Ault]], [[Colorado]] and on August 1942, he was drafted into the United States Army and sent to [[Camp Roberts, California]], where he received his basic training.

On May 26, 1943, the [[32d Infantry Regiment (United States)|32nd Infantry Regiment]] was pinned down by enemy fire in the vicinity of Fish Hook Ridge, in the [[Aleutian Islands]]. On his own account, Pvt. Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez was shot in the head as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.<ref>[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/defen11c.htm Aleutian Islands World War II.] Hispanics in Americas Defense. Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>

Of the 13 Medals of Honor awarded to Hispanics, six were awarded posthumously. Texas accounted for the most Hispanic Medal of Honor recipients in World War II with a total of five (Marcario Garcia was raised in [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]). The 13 recipients are:

Hispanics were recipients of every major U.S. military decoration during World War II; they have also been honored with military awards from other countries. Thirty-one Hispanic-Americans were awarded the [[Croix de guerre|Belgium Croix de Guerre]] and three Hispanic-Americans received the [[French Croix de Guerre]]. The figures in the following table were derived from the book ''Undaunted Courage Mexican American Patriots Of World War II'' published in 2005 by Latino Advocates for Education, Inc. and according to Rogelio C.

===Hero Street, USA===
In the mid-West town of [[Silvis, Illinois|Silvis]], [[Illinois]], the former Second Street is now known as Hero Street USA. The muddy block and a half long street was home to Mexican immigrants who worked the railroads. The 22 families who lived on the street were a close-knit group. From this small street, 84 men served in World War II, [[Korean War|Korea]], and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. The street contributed more men to military services in World War II and Korea than any other street of comparable size in the U.S. In total, eight men from Hero Street gave their lives during World War II<U+2014>Joseph Gomez, Peter Macias, Johnny Mu<U+00F1>os, Tony Pompa, Frank Sandoval, Joseph <U+201C>Joe<U+201D> Sandoval, William <U+201C>Bill<U+201D> Sandoval and Claro Soliz.

Retrieved July 27, 2007.</ref>

Of the 22 families on Second Street, the two Sandoval families had a total of thirteen men who served in the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]]. Three died in service during World War II. The Sandovals were two families of Mexican immigrants, with the same surname, who settled in the town of Silvis, Illinois and lived on Second Street.<ref name="Navy">[http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2004/September/perspective.htm Sealift Honoring Hispanic Heroes].

Edubigis and Angelina Sandoval immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. When the news reached Silvis that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor, two of the Sandoval sons, Joe and Frank, joined the U.S. Army. Joe was sent to combat in Africa, the Middle East and Europe with the 41st Armored Infantry Division. Frank was assigned to the 209 Combat Engineering Battalion and served in the Pacific. Frank was the first of the Sandovals to die and Joe followed a year later.<ref name="Navy"/>

Joseph and Carmen Sandoval also immigrated to the United States from Mexico. When the war broke out, their son Bill asked for permission to enlist in the Army and both parents consented to their son's request. Bill Sandoval was trained as a paratrooper and was assigned to the [[82nd Airborne Division (United States)|82nd Airborne Division]]. He was killed during a combat mission on October 6, 1944.

Other families like the Sandovals had multiple members join the Armed Forces. The Banuelo family, originally from Mexico and who resided in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], the Garcia family from Los Angeles, California, and the Mora family from [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Texas]], each had six siblings who served in the military during the war.

==Post-war commemoration==
The memory of Hispanic American heroes has been honored in various ways: some of their names can be found on ships, in parks and inscribed on monuments. Captain [[Linda Garcia Cubero]] (USAF), while serving as Special Assistant to the Deputy [[Secretary of Defense]], supervised the development of a United States [[Commemorative stamps|commemorative stamp]] to honor Hispanics who served in America's defense.
