'''Michael Wayne Junkin''' (born November 21, 1964) is a former [[American football]] [[linebacker]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for three seasons with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He played in 20 games over the course of his NFL career.

Junkin played four years of college football at [[Duke University]]. In the [[1987 NFL Draft]], the Cleveland Browns traded up to select him with the fifth overall pick. He played in parts of two seasons for the Browns, both of which ended early due to injury. Junkin was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round selection and played in five more games. After his release from the Chiefs, he did not play another game in the NFL. His failure to establish himself in the NFL has caused him to be regarded as a [[draft bust]].

==High school and college==
Junkin was born in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]] to Kirk, a [[United Airlines]] pilot, and Doris, a substitute teacher. His brother [[Trey Junkin]] was an NFL player as well.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Junkin File|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=July 27, 1987|page=4C}}</ref> Junkin attended [[Belvidere High School (Belvidere, Illinois)|Belvidere High School]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]], and played [[tight end]] on the football team.<ref name=grossi>{{cite book|title=Tales from the Browns Sideline|first=Tony|last=Grossi|authorlink=Tony Grossi|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2004|page=135|isbn= 9781582617138}}</ref> In 1982, his senior year, he was the team's MVP and captain.

After graduating from high school, Junkin played [[college football]] with the [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke Blue Devils]]. He played in three games for the Blue Devils as a freshman. In one game against [[NC State Wolfpack football|North Carolina State]], Junkin had 25 tackles en route to a 27&ndash;26 Duke victory; head coach [[Steve Sloan]] stated afterwards that it was "one of the best games I have ever seen a freshman play."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat=19831115&id=YZobAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rlIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2807,1769253|title=Groh Pleased With Progress of Deacs|work=[[The Dispatch (Lexington)|The Dispatch]]|location=[[Lexington, North Carolina]]|date=November 15, 1983|page=10}}</ref> Between his freshman and sophomore seasons, Junkin went from 205 pounds to 240 to help get more playing time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19840819&id=SGAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j84EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4982,4701667|title=Tigers' Goal: Be Top 10 Team|work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|date=August 19, 1984|page=B6}}</ref> As a sophomore, he spent the 1984 season as one of five starting linebackers on a modified Duke defense, which normally would have three or four linebackers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1807&dat=19841004&id=2qMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2HEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=990,1398733|first=Rich|last=Levine|title=Injuries Bedevil Duke Season|work=[[The Cavalier Daily]]|date=October 4, 1984|page=7}}</ref> In his junior season, he was again a starting linebacker and finished the season with 162 tackles despite playing on an injured knee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1807&dat=19860924&id=8z4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8WkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6831,1602326|title=Blue Devils Hope To Improve Play|work=The Cavalier Daily|date=Septembe 25, 1986|page=10}}</ref> Junkin started off his senior year with 15 tackles against [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] despite battling a [[head cold]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19860907&id=OKdOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4271,1688318|title=Linebacker Beats Cold to Lead Duke to 17-6 Win|work=[[Lakeland Ledger]]|date=September 7, 1986|page=13C}}</ref> Three weeks later in a game against [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]], Junkin had 18 tackles and was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] defensive player of the week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19860930&id=il0bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SU4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3486,6496942|title=Junkin, Hall Honored|work=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|date=September 30, 1986|page=18}}</ref> Junkin graduated from Duke after the 1986 season as the school record-holder for career tackles with 512.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19861123&id=vOo0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=FRQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6168,3385222|title=North Carolina Wins, But Bowls Silent|first=Scott|last=Whisnant|work=[[Star-News]]|date=November 23, 1986|page=1B}}</ref> Due to his performance his senior year, Junkin was named to the [[College Football All-America Team|Second Team College Football All-American]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=246901|title=Football All-America|publisher=Duke University Blue Devils|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Professional career==
Junkin was selected with the fifth overall pick in the [[1987 NFL Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Browns]]. To acquire him, the Browns traded [[Chip Banks]] along with their first and second-round picks to the [[San Diego Chargers]] for their first and second-round picks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19870428&id=9HoUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5QIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6808,80481|title=Browns Trade Banks, Select Duke's Junkin|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=April 28, 1987|page=18}}</ref> In regards to the selection, head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]] stated that scout [[Dom Anile]] had watched him play, and compared his playing style to "a mad dog in a meat market."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espncleveland.com/common/more.php?m=49&post_id=881|first=Tony|last=Grossi|title=Memories of Browns past drafts include the mad dog in a meat market and a GM singing a tune|work=[[ESPN]] Cleveland|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> However, Anile saw him as a second-round talent despite the quote, and felt he was not worth the fifth overall selection, but Schottenheimer overruled his scouts and selected Junkin with that pick.<ref name=grossi/>

Entering the [[1987 Cleveland Browns season]], Junkin was projected to be the starting [[outside linebacker]] opposite [[Clay Matthews, Jr.]] despite playing [[inside linebacker]] in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that would be difficult for him to make.<ref>{{cite news|title=Junkin Turns Attention To Outside|first=Tony|last=Grossi|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 27, 1987|page=4C}}</ref> After a 16-day [[wikt:holdout|holdout]], the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wait Over; Junkin Signs With Browns|first=Tony|last=Grossi|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 11, 1987|page=1C}}</ref> After missing the first preseason game against the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]], he made his debut against the [[New York Giants]].

Due to a combination of the Browns drafting [[Clifford Charlton]] and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the [[1988 Cleveland Browns season]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Grossi|title=Browns Go For Defense|work=The Plain Dealer|date=April 25, 1988|page=6C}}</ref> He spent training camp competing with [[Eddie Johnson (linebacker)|Eddie Johnson]] for the second inside linebacker position alongside [[Mike Johnson (linebacker)|Mike Johnson]], and by the end of preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Grossi|title=Junkin to Start|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 1, 1988|page=1F}}</ref> In his first career start against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6&ndash;3 Browns win.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Junkin Watch|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 5, 1988|page=2C}}</ref> A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slaughter Braced for More Practice|first=Mary Kay|last=Cabot|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 2, 1988|page=3C}}</ref> He was given the starting job again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Injuries, Infighting Inevitable|first=Bob|last=Kravitz|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 17, 1988|page=7C}}</ref>

In early 1989, Schottenheimer was fired as Browns head coach, and took the head coaching job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still had faith in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick to bring him to Kansas City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Junkin, Byner Traded By Browns|first=Tony|last=Grossi|work=The Plain Dealer|date=April 24, 1989|page=1D}}</ref> Two weeks after the trade, a report came out that Junkin had taken steroids provided by a doctor to treat an injured ankle, and had failed a drug test at the [[scouting combine]] as a result.<ref>{{cite news|title=Junkin Tested Positive|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19890508&id=TTEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cOYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3097,2080596|work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=May 8, 1989|page=2B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-05-08/sports/8905085215_1_junkin-steroids-plain-dealer|title=Chiefs Linebacker Used Steroids|date=May 8, 1989|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> Entering the [[1989 Kansas City Chiefs season]], Junkin competed with [[Walker Lee Ashley]] for the second inside linebacker spot alongside [[Dino Hackett]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Slaughter Now Highest-Paid Browns Receiver|first=Tony|last=Grossi|work=The Plain Dealer|date=July 30, 1989|page=2C}}</ref> Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him for the rest of the season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19891026&id=DDwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KuUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5808,3913594|title=KC's Junkin, Thomas put on Injured Reserve|work=Lawrence Journal-World|date=October 26, 1989|page=6D}}</ref>

Junkin became known as a [[draft bust]] due to his unproductive career.<ref name=grossi/> An [[ESPN]] article in 2008 noted Junkin noted as the eighth biggest draft bust of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft08/news/story?id=3325687|title=Phillips couldn't outrun off-the-field troubles|work=ESPN|date=April 18, 2008|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref> He was also named one of the Cleveland' Browns worst three draft picks from 1995 or earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000157335/article/cleveland-browns-best-and-worst-draft-picks|title=Cleveland Browns: Best and worst draft picks|first=Marc|last=Sessler|work=[[NFL.com]]|date=March 31, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>
