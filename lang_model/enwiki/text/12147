'''Anthony Joseph "A.J." Foyt IV''' (born May 25, 1984) is an [[United States|American]] race car driver. He competed in the [[IndyCar Series]] and briefly in the [[NASCAR]] [[Nationwide Series]], then called the Busch Series. He is the grandson of [[A. J. Foyt]].

He began his career racing [[karting|karts]]. He moved up through the open wheel racing ranks, winning the 2002 [[Firestone Indy Lights|Infiniti Pro Series]]. When Foyt made his first [[Indianapolis 500]] race in [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]], he became the youngest driver to start in the event. He continued in [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] for two more years until his back was injured at the [[2005 Indianapolis 500]]. Later that season he made several NASCAR Busch Series starts. He was scheduled to continue in the Busch Series in 2006, but the team was bought out and his contract didn't allow him to race in non-Dodge car. He returned to IndyCar late that season.

==Personal life==
Foyt was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] but lists his hometown as [[Hockley, Texas]],<ref name="IndyCarBiograph">{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/drivers/driver.php?driver_id=94|title=A.J. Foyt IV|publisher=IndyCar|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> the long-time residence of his grandfather, racing legend [[A. J. Foyt]], who guided him through much of his career.

Foyt appeared in the 2005 film ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1894863/ A.J. Foyt IV], IMDB.com</ref> and is an avid [[Texas Longhorns]] fan. In March 2007, He was charged with [[DUI]] stemming from an incident in December of the previous year.<ref>[http://www.speedtv.com/articles/indycar/auto/35790/ Foyt IV Charged with DUI], Racer Magazine, March 6, 2007</ref>

He is married to [[Indianapolis Colts]] vice-president [[Casey Irsay]], daughter of team owner [[Jim Irsay]], in July 2009.<ref name="FoytRacing">{{cite web|url=http://www.foytracing.com/|title=The Foyt Boys Are Headed for the Super Bowl|date=January 30, 2009|publisher=Foyt Racing|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> On September 19th, 2010, it was announced by commentators during the [[Indy Japan 300]] that Casey Foyt had given birth to a son, A.J. Foyt V.  

Foyt is sometimes referred to by the nickname "[[Quattro]]" or the stylized "AJIV" or "AJ4."

==Early career in IndyCar==
Foyt began racing [[Junior Dragster]]s as a nine-year-old and won two titles.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> He then moved to karts for many years before moving to formula race cars in 2001.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> In 2001, he won six of nine [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] events to claim the Southwest Regional championship.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> He finished third in SCCA's national point championships and was the series' Rookie of the Year.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> That same year, he competed at the [[World Karting Association]]'s Dirt World Championships at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and finished second in the Briggs Heavy feature event.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> Foyt competed in his first [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Silver Crown event that August.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> In 2002, A.J. moved to his grandfather's team, [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises]], in the newly-formed [[Infiniti Pro Series]] and won the championship with four wins in seven events.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> In 2003, he moved up to Foyt Enterprises' [[Indy Racing League|IRL]] IndyCar Series team, finishing 21st in the final standings.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" /> Foyt currently holds the record for the youngest driver to race in the Indy 500.  His rookie race in 2003 occurred on his 19th birthday. He took the record from [[Josele Garza]] who was slightly over 2 months older for his first start in 1981.<ref>Mittman, Dick, [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=1162 Young Foyt Feeling Comfortable In Big Saddle At Indy], IndianapolisMotorSpeedway.com, April 21, 2003</ref> He continued to struggle in IndyCars, finishing 18th in the 2004 points and 20th in 2005. In the [[2005 Indianapolis 500]] Foyt was involved in an accident with a top [[Champ Car]] driver, [[Bruno Junqueira]], who suffered a broken back.<ref>Shaw, Kate, [http://www.rfmsports.com/Editorials/Bruno.lives.050530.html  Bruno Junqueira recovering from surgery after Indy 500 crash], rfm sports, May 30, 2005</ref>  The season did not improve as the team switched from [[Toyota]] to [[Chevrolet]] power mid-season<ref name="ChampCarStats">[http://www.champcarstats.com/drivers/FoytAJIV.htm A. J. Foyt IV], ChampCarStats.com</ref> and Foyt was replaced for the late-season road course events by [[Jeff Bucknum]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_km3610/is_200508/ai_n14911579 Bucknum to replace Foyt at Infineon.], Crash.net, August 2005</ref>

==NASCAR==
In October 2005, Foyt announced that at the end of the 2005 season, he would leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the [[NASCAR]] [[Busch Series]] for the #38 [[Akins Motorsports]] team and was signed as a developmental driver for [[Evernham Motorsports]]. He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award.<ref>[http://www.foytracing.com/AJFoytIV/2005_reports/AJIV_rr_california.html Race Report: California Speedway], FoytRacing.com, October 4, 2005</ref> However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team.<ref>Rodman, Dave, [http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/bg/04/21/afoyt.revernham.moving.on/index.html Evernham looking to put Foyt back behind wheel], NASCAR.com, April 21, 2006</ref>  After a week off, [[Ray Evernham]] found him a ride with [[FitzBradshaw Racing]], but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since.

==Return to IndyCar==
===2006===
On September 5, 2006, Foyt was tabbed by the 2005 IndyCar Championship team, [[Andretti Green Racing]], to replace injured regular AGR driver [[Dario Franchitti]]. Foyt drove the #27 Klein Tools/Canadian Club Dallara Honda in the IRL season's final event at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] and finished 14th.<ref>Margolis, Bob, [http://sports.yahoo.com/irl/news?slug=bm-familiarfaces051307&prov=yhoo&type=lgns Glad to be back], Yahoo! Sports, May 13, 2007</ref>[[Image:Anthony Joseph Foyt IV - Milwaukee Mile 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Foyt Driving at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in 2007]]

===2007===
In January 2007, Foyt signed with [[Vision Racing]] to return to the IRL for the [[2007 in IRL|2007 season]] as well as drive with the team in the 2007 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].<ref>[http://www.fastmachines.com/archives/irl/004062.php Foyt the Fourth Official at Vision Racing], January 18, 2007</ref>

On August 5, 2007, during the [[Firestone Indy 400]], Foyt was involved in a spectacular seven-car crash in which [[Dario Franchitti]]'s car was sent airborne and then came down on Foyt's car. While Foyt was uninjured, Franchitti's car left visible tire marks on Foyt's helmet.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=1&id=2962434 Franchitti OK after car flips sideways, turns upside down during Indy 400 wreck], Associated Press via ESPN.com, August 6, 2007</ref> Foyt's crew was able to repair the car and get him back on the track where he completed enough laps to secure an 8th place finish. The following week at the [[Meijer Indy 300]], Foyt's crew gave him great pit stops which allowed him to take to lead with 10 laps remaining. Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by [[Tony Kanaan]] and [[Scott Dixon]], he managed to hold on the rest of the way and drive to a career-best 3rd place finish, the first Top-5 finish of his career. It was also the best finish in Vision Racing's team history, tying [[Tomas Scheckter]]'s 3rd place finish at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in 2006.<ref>[http://www.visionracing.com/news/index.cfm?cid=3634 Foyt leads 13 laps and takes third as Vision Racing finishes all three cars in top-10 at Kentucky], Vision Racing, August 11, 2007</ref>

===2008===
[[Image:A.J.FoytIVTexasJune2008.jpg|thumb|right|Signing autographs in 2008]]
Foyt returned to be one of Vision Racing's drivers in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona.<ref>Dagys, John. [http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=278091 World's best flock to Daytona for 24-Hour] Motorsport.com, January 21, 2008</ref> He returned to the Vision team for the [[2008 IndyCar Series season]] driving the #2 car that was formerly driven by [[Tomas Scheckter]].

On March 28, Foyt seemed to have earned a career best start for an [[IndyCar Series]] race at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] for the [[2008 GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300]] with the third best qualifying time.<ref name="IndyCarBackToTheRear">{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/news/?story_id=10811|title=Back to the Rear|last=Lewandowski|first=Dave|date=March 2008|publisher=IndyCar|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> His [[Vision Racing]] teammate, [[Ed Carpenter (racecar driver)|Ed Carpenter]] also earned a career best start with the 2nd best qualifying time.<ref name="IndyCarBackToTheRear" /> However, both cars failed technical inspection, meaning they had to start at the rear of the field.<ref name="IndyCarBackToTheRear" /> Foyt drove his No. 2 entry from the last position (25th) to a ninth place finish in the race.<ref name="IndyCarBiograph" />

Two races later at [[Twin Ring Motegi]] in Japan, Foyt had his first top-10 start of the season for the [[Indy Japan 300]] when qualifying was rained out. The starting grid was based on driver points standings. Of the drivers there, Foyt was eighth in the championship points standings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backstretchmotorsports.com/irl/rain-gives-castroneves-pole-at-twin-ring-motegi-japan-300.html|title=Rain Gives Castroneves Pole at Twin Ring Motegi Japan 300|date=April 18, 2008|publisher=Backstretch Motorsports|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> He was helped with some drivers ahead of him racing in the [[Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]]. Foyt had contact with the wall, forcing him to retire from the race early, with a 15th place finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.v8x.com.au/cms/A_110438/article.html|title=Danica Patrick Wins Indy Japan 300 At Twin Ring Motegi|date=April 21, 2008|publisher=V8x|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

The following week at [[Kansas Speedway]], Foyt and his teammate [[Ed Carpenter (racecar driver)|Ed Carpenter]] shared the third row, with Foyt qualifying 5th. It was his best career start and second top-10 start in a row. In the [[RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300]], Foyt had his chances of a high finish end as his car was caught in the pits when an accident involving [[Buddy Rice]] occurred.<ref name="IndycarRoadRunnerTurboIndy300">{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/pro/news/story.php?story_id=11124|title=Road Runner Turbo Indy 300 Daily Trackside Report|date=April 27, 2008  |publisher=IndyCar|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> Foyt would drive to an eighth place finish.<ref name="IndycarRoadRunnerTurboIndy300" /> Foyt's best finish of the season came in the [[Iowa Corn Indy 250]] in June at the [[Iowa Speedway]] where he finished fifth. Foyt finished 19th in points.

===2009<U+2013>2010===
[[Vision Racing]] was unable to secure sponsorship to run a second car in 2009, leaving Foyt out of a ride. He returned to A. J. Foyt Enterprises for the [[93rd Indianapolis 500]], driving the #41 [[ABC Supply]] entry for his grandfather, A. J. Foyt. Foyt finished 16th on the lead lap as his teammate [[Vitor Meira]] was injured in a late-race crash. [[Paul Tracy]] was drafted as the substitute driver for Meira at the next race, but Foyt stepped into the car for his home race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]]. [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] drove the car for the rest of the season and Texas would be Foyt's last race of 2009.

In 2010 he was again entered in a second Foyt Enterprises car for the Indy 500. After the morning practice session on the final day of qualifying A. J. Foyt IV and his grandfather got in an argument regarding the car's setup resulting in the younger A. J. quitting the team.<ref>[http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/sports/auto_racing/indycar/aj-foyt-iv-speaks-out-after-family-feud A.J.
