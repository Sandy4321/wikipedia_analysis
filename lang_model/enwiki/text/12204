{{nihongo|'''''Sendai'''''|<U+5DDD><U+5185> <U+8EFD><U+5DE1><U+6D0B><U+8266>|Sendai keijun'y<U+014D>kan}} was a [[Sendai class cruiser|''Sendai''-class]] [[light cruiser]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. She was named after the [[Sendai River (Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>)|Sendai River]] in southern [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]].

==Background==
''Sendai'' was the [[lead ship]] of the three vessels completed in her class of [[light cruiser]]s, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a [[destroyer]] flotilla.

==Service career==

===Early career===
''Sendai'' was completed at the [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi]] [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] shipyards on 29 April 1924. Immediately on completion, she was assigned to [[Yangtze River]] patrol in China. She played an important role in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in the opening stages of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and later covered the landings of Japanese forces in southern China.

===Invasions of Southeast Asia===
{{main|Japanese Invasion of Malaya}}
On 20 November 1941, ''Sendai'' became [[flagship]] of DesRon 3 under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Shintaro Hashimoto]]. 

At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Sendai'' was engaged in escorting transports carrying [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] and the [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] to invade [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. At 23:45 on 7 December 1941, ''Sendai'' and her destroyer squadron ([[Japanese destroyer Ayanami (1929)|''Ayanami'']], [[Japanese destroyer Isonami|''Isonami'']], [[Japanese destroyer Shikinami|''Shikinami'']], and [[Japanese destroyer Uranami|''Uranami'']]) commenced a bombardment of [[Kota Bharu]], Malaya. They were attacked by seven [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson bomber]]s, which sank one of the transports and damaged two others.

On 9 December 1941, {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-65}} reported sighting of [[Royal Navy]] [[Force Z]] (the Royal Navy [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and supporting destroyers). The report was received by ''Sendai'', which relayed the message to [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Jisabur<U+014D> Ozawa]] aboard his flagship, [[Japanese cruiser Chokai|''Chokai'']]. However, the reception was poor and the message took another 90 minutes to decode. Moreover, ''I-65'''s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by [[torpedo bomber]]s of the 22nd Air Flotilla from [[French Indochina|Indochina]].

On 19 December 1941, off Kota Bahru in the [[South China Sea]], [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] submarine ''O-20'' sighted Sendai escorting the second Malaya Convoy's 39 transports. At 1115, the ''Sendai's'' [[floatplane]], a [[Kawanishi E7K]]2 "Alf", spotted and bombed the ''O-20'', which was also attacked by ''Ayanami'' and ''Yugiri'' with  [[depth charge]]s. That night ''O-20'' surfaced to recharge her batteries, and a flame from her engines' exhaust gave her away; she was sunk by ''Uranami''.

''Sendai'' made three more troop convoy escort runs to Malay at the end of December 1941 and in January 1942. On the fourth run, 10 January 1942 {{USS|Seadragon|SS-194|6}} spotted the convoy and fired two torpedoes at the last transport, but both missed. On the fifth run, on 26 January, ''Sendai'' and her convoy were attacked by the {{HMS|Thanet|H29|6}} and {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}} about {{convert|80|nmi|km|0}} north of [[Singapore]] in the [[Battle off Endau]]. The torpedoes from the Allied vessels missed, and ''Shirayuki'' and ''Sendai'' returned fire with their {{convert|4|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns. ''Thanet'' was sunk, while ''Vampire'' was undamaged and escaped to [[Singapore]].

From February through March, ''Sendai'' was assigned to cover Japanese landings in [[Sumatra]], and in sweeping the sea lanes and the [[Strait of Malacca]] for British and Dutch vessels escaping from Singapore. At the end of March, ''Sendai'' covered the landing of one battalion of the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA's 18th Infantry Division]] at [[Port Blair]], [[Andaman Islands]]. At the end of April, ''Sendai'' returned to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] for repairs.

===Battle of Midway===
On 29 May 1942, ''Sendai'' departed with the Main Body of the [[Combined Fleet]] for [[Midway Atoll|Midway]]. The Main Body remained {{convert|600|nmi|km|-1}} behind Vice Admiral  [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s First Carrier Striking Force and thus did not engage American forces. ''Sendai'' returned to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] on 14 June 1942 without having seen combat.

===Solomon Islands campaigns===
On 15 July 1942 DesRon 3 was reassigned to the Southwest Force to cover operations in [[Burma]] and [[Indian Ocean raid|raids in the Indian Ocean]], arriving at [[Mergui]], Burma 31 July. However, with American landings on [[Guadalcanal]], the planned [[Indian Ocean]] operations were cancelled and ''Sendai'' was sent to [[Makassar]], [[Davao]] and [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] instead, to escort troop convoys to [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]] and [[Shortland]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. On 8 September, ''Sendai'' shelled [[Tulagi]] and on 12 September ''Sendai'' (with destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Shikinami|''Shikinami'']], [[Japanese destroyer Fubuki|''Fubuki'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Suzukaze|''Suzukaze'']]) bombarded [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]], Guadalcanal. ''Sendai'' remained active in [[Solomon Island]] operations through November 1942, participating in both the [[First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] (where she remained as distant cover) and the Second [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] (where it was attacked by the {{USS|Washington|BB-56}}'s {{convert|16|in|mm|0|sing=on}} main guns, but she escaped undamaged) of which in this engagement, the battleship [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']] and the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Ayanami (1929)|''Ayanami'']] were attacked and sunk by ''Washington'', while attempting to destroy {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57}}.

On 25 February 1943 ''Sendai'' was reassigned to the Eighth Fleet at Rabaul under Vice Admiral [[Gunichi Mikawa]] and remained on patrol around Rabaul through April. Returning to Sasebo in May, ''Sendai'' was repaired and modified. Her No.5 {{convert|5.5|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun mount was removed and two triple [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|25 mm AA gun mounts]] and Type 21 [[radar]] were installed. Repairs were completed 25 June 1943 and ''Sendai'' returned to Truk on 5 July. On 7 July Rear Admiral [[Baron]] [[Matsuji Ijuin]] assumed command of DesRon 3. During the next three months, ''Sendai'' operated out of Rabaul covering reinforcement convoys to [[Buin, Papua New Guinea]] and Shortland. 

On 18 July 1943 off [[Kolombangara]] the group was attacked by Guadalcanal-based [[USMC|Marine]] [[Grumman]] [[TBM Avenger]] torpedo-bombers, and two days later by [[North American Aviation|North American]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] bombers but was not damaged; it also escaped damage after being bombed by a [[Consolidated]] [[B-24 Liberator]] on 1 November 1943.

The following day, 2 November 1943, at the [[Battle of Empress Augusta Bay]], the Japanese fleet attempting to reinforce Bougainville was intercepted by Task Force 39 with the light cruisers {{USS|Cleveland|CL-55}}, {{USS|Columbia|CL-56}}, {{USS|Montpelier|CL-57}} and {{USS|Denver|CL-58}} and destroyers {{USS|Stanly|DD-478}}, {{USS|Charles Ausburne|DD-570}}, {{USS|Claxton|DD-571}}, {{USS|Dyson|DD-572}}, {{USS|Converse|DD-509}}, {{USS|Foote|DD-511}}, {{USS|Spence|DD-512}} and {{USS|Thatcher|DD-514}}. The Japanese force included [[Japanese cruiser Myoko|''Myoko'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Haguro|''Haguro'']], ''Sendai'' and [[Japanese cruiser Agano|''Agano'']] with destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Shigure|''Shigure'']], [[Japanese destroyer Samidare|''Samidare'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Shiratsuyu|''Shiratsuyu'']], [[Japanese destroyer Naganami|''Naganami'']], [[Japanese destroyer Wakatsuki|''Wakatsuki'']] and the [[Japanese destroyer Hatsukaze|''Hatsukaze'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Amagiri|''Amagiri'']], [[Japanese destroyer Y<U+016B>nagi (1924)|''Y<U+016B>nagi'']], [[Japanese destroyer Uzuki|''Uzuki'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Fuzuki|''Fuzuki'']].

''Shigure'' spotted the American destroyers at {{convert|7500|yd|m|-2}}, turned hard starboard and launched eight torpedoes. ''Sendai'' also turned hard starboard, but bore down on ''Shigure'', barely avoiding a collision. All four Allied cruisers took ''Sendai'' under radar directed 6-inch fire. They hit her with their first salvo and more thereafter, setting her afire. ''Sendai'' sank the following morning at {{coord|06|10|S|154|20|E}}, along with ''Hatsukaze''. Captain Shoji and 184 crewmen went down with the ship, but 236 other crewmen were rescued by destroyers.

On 3 November 1943, Admiral Ijuin and 75 more survivors from ''Sendai'' were rescued by the Japanese submarine {{ship|Japanese submarine|RO-104}}.

''Sendai'' was removed from the Navy List on 5 January 1944.
