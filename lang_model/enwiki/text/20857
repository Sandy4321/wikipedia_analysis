'''Daniel Peter Graves''' (born [[August 7]], [[1973]] in [[Saigon]], [[South Vietnam]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[starting pitcher]] who is currently a [[free agent]]. Born to an [[United States|American]] serviceman father and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, he is the only [[Vietnam]]-born player in the history of the major leagues, and one of the few [[Vietnamese-American]] players. 

==Biography==
===High school and college===
Graves's family moved to the U.S. when he was fourteen months old. He graduated from Brandon High School in [[Brandon, Florida]] and was awarded a baseball scholarship to the [[University of Miami]]. As a [[right-handed]] relief pitcher for the school as a junior, he posted a 0.89 [[earned run average]] and led collegiate baseball with a school-record 21 [[Save (sport)|saves]].

===Major League Baseball career===
Graves was selected by the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the fourth round of the [[1994 Major League Baseball Draft]]. Two days after being drafted, he tore his [[Anterior Cruciate Ligament|ACL]] during the [[College World Series]]. After a year of rehabilitation, he was named Cleveland's top minor league pitcher of 1995, and was in the major leagues a year later. He was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in July {{mlby|1997}}.

In his first nine seasons with Cleveland and Cincinnati, Graves compiled a 40-42 record as a pitcher with 406 [[strikeout]]s, a 3.89 ERA, and 172 [[Save (baseball)|saves]] in 755.2 innings. He is the only player ever to have more than one season in which all his hits were [[home run]]s. This happened in {{mlby|2000}} and {{mlby|2001}}, with one homer each.

On [[May 23]], [[2005]], Graves was released by Cincinnati after a poor start to the season and after making an obscene gesture to a heckler who reportedly yelled racial slurs at him. He subsequently was signed as a free agent by the [[New York Mets]] on [[June 11]], [[2005]].  

After putting up a 5.89 ERA with the Mets, he was designated for assignment on [[August 23]], [[2005]]. He cleared waivers and was sent to [[minor league baseball#Today's Farm System|Triple-A]] [[Norfolk Tides|Norfolk]] on [[August 26]], but was called back up to the Mets when rosters expanded. Graves was 0-2 with an 18.00 ERA in five games with Norfolk [http://www.accessnorthga.com/sports/newfullstory.asp?ID=95865]. 

On [[December 19]], [[2005]], Graves signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. Graves pitched well in [[spring training]], earning a spot in the Indian [[bullpen]], but he was designated for assignment on [[May 12]], [[2006]], after he opened the season with a 2-1 record and 5.79 ERA in 13 relief appearances [http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060512&content_id=1451159&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle].  

On [[May 18]], [[2006]], Graves was assigned to the Indians' Triple-A affiliate, the [[Buffalo Bisons]], in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He finished the 2006 season with the Bisons, with a 4.01 ERA (1 Win 1 Loss).

Graves signed a minor league deal with the Rockies on [[December 19]], [[2006]]. On [[March 24]], [[2007]] the Rockies released him.

During the 2007 season Graves was on the roster of the [[Long Island Ducks]] of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]], leading the league in saves. [http://www.daytondailynews.com/localnews/content/oh/story/sports/pro/reds/2008/03/31/ddn040108redsnotes.html]

Graves later signed with the [[Minnesota Twins]] on [[March 30]], [[2008]], and played for the Triple-A [[Rochester Red Wings]] most of the year. He became a free agent at the end of the season.

==Personal life==
Danny has four children with his ex-wife Andrea. Three are biological and one is adopted.
