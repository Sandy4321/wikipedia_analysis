'''Joseph Haslet''' (1769 &ndash; [[June 20]] [[1823]]) was an [[United States |American]] [[farmer]] and [[politician]] from Cedar Creek Village in Cedar Creek Hundred, [[Sussex County, Delaware |Sussex County]], [[Delaware]]. He was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States) |Democratic-Republican Party]], who served twice as [[Governor of Delaware]]. 

==Early life and family==
Haslet was born in 1769 in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]], [[Delaware]], son of Colonel [[John Haslet (1727-1777) |John Haslet]] and Jemima Molleston Brinkle Haslet. Colonel [[John Haslet (1727-1777) |John Haslet]] was the commander of the [[Delaware]] Regiment in the [[Continental Army]] and was killed at the [[Battle of Princeton]] in January 1777. Jemima Haslet died a month later "of an inflammation in the throat and lungs." Chief Justice William Killen became guardian for the children and eventually Joseph was apprenticed to a watchmaker in [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]]. After he came of age he bought a farm in Cedar Creek Hundred in [[Sussex County, Delaware |Sussex County]]. He first married Mary Draper, with whom he one child, Nathaniel. He later married Rachel Hickman and they had no children.

==Political career==
Haslet ran for [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] in 1804, losing to the [[United States Federalist Party |Federalist]] candidate, [[Nathaniel Mitchell]], and again in 1807, again losing to the [[United States Federalist Party |Federalist]] candidate, [[George Truitt]]. Finally, in 1810 he squeaked out a victory against [[United States Federalist Party |Federalist]] candidate [[Daniel Rodney]] and began his first term as [[Governor of Delaware]], serving from [[January 15]] [[1811]] until [[January 18]] [[1814]].

The [[War of 1812]] was the central event of Haslet's tenure as [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]]. Entry into the [[War of 1812]] was not met with much approval from [[United States Federalist Party |Federalist]] [[Delaware]], but Haslet was a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States) |Democrat]] and called the [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] into special session to raise militia. Carol Hoffecker in ''Democracy in Delaware'' describes him saying: "'Without your aid,' the governor told the predominantly [[United States Federalist Party |Federalist]] legislators, 'compliance is impossible.' The militia was in shambles, he said, without arms or organization. But he was certain that Delaware would rise to the challenge. 'In this state it is not a question of whether the authority of the United States is to be respected. The State of Delaware will never hesitate to cooperate with her sister states in defending the common rights of the nation.'" <ref>{{cite book |last= Hoffecker |first= Carol E |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= Democracy in Delaware |origyear=2006 |publisher= Cedar Tree Books |location= Wilmington, Delaware |pages= p.70 |chapter= |quote =''Journal of the House of Representatives (1812), p. 4-6.}}</ref> The [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] then voted to create a 1,000 man militia and appropriated $25,000 to equip them.

At first, there were several exciting naval victories, including the capture of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain |British]] ship ''Frolic'' by Captain Jacob Jones of [[Smyrna, Delaware |Smyrna]], [[Delaware]]. He was brother-in-law of former [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] [[James Sykes (governor)|James Sykes]]. By February 1813, however, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain |British]] sent fleets into both the [[Delaware Bay |Delaware]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]]s. For protection an encampment was built at "the Rocks" in [[Wilmington, Delaware |Wilmington]], Captain [[Caleb P. Bennett]] fortified [[New Castle, Delaware |New Castle]], and [[Pea Patch Island]] was deeded to the U.S. Government so that there might be a fort built there.

[[Lewes, Delaware |Lewes]] was completely exposed and, as expected, received repeated demands for supplies by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain |British]] fleet. Haslet and the militia rushed to [[Lewes, Delaware |Lewes']] defense. Having refused the demands, on [[April 6]] [[1813]] [[Lewes, Delaware |Lewes]] was subjected to a furious all day bombardment, followed by a half-hearted landing the next day. The bombardment actually did little damage. Scharf's account reports "one chicken was killed and one pig wounded," but over 300 cannon balls were picked up, including 40 or 50 that were 32 pounders. <ref>{{cite book |author=Scharf, John Thomas |title=History of Delaware 1609-1888. 2 vols. |publisher=L. J. Richards & Co., Philadelphia |year=1888|id=}}
</ref> The landing the next day was beaten off as well. By June the [[Kingdom of Great Britain |British]] simply landed at [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]] and took what they needed. Meanwhile the other [[Kingdom of Great Britain |British]] fleet was sailing the [[Chesapeake Bay |Chesapeake]], raiding [[Havre de Grace, Maryland |Havre de Grace]], Georgetown, and Frenchtown, keeping everyone in [[New Castle County, Delaware |New Castle County]] very nervous. 

Eight years after leaving office Haslet ran for [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] again and was elected by an even narrower margin than the first time, beating the [[Federalist Party (United States) |Federalist]] candidate James Booth. It was a bitter campaign. Haslet was accused of being a former slave owner, and neglecting the [[Lewes, Delaware |Lewes]] defenses in 1813. Booth, on the other hand, was accused of being a [[Loyalist (American Revolution) |Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Haslet became the only man in the 19th century to win two terms as [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]], but his combined victory margins were less than 100 votes. He served from [[January 21]] [[1823]] for only five months until his death on [[June 20]] [[1823]].

==Death and legacy==
Haslet died [[June 20]] [[1823]] at Cedar Creek Village in Cedar Creek Hundred, [[Sussex County, Delaware |Sussex County]], [[Delaware]]. He was the fourth [[Governor of Delaware]] to die in office. He was first buried on his farm at Cedar Creek Village, but was moved in 1917 to the Odd Fellows Cemetery in [[Milford, Delaware |Milford]]. He appears to have died without any heirs, his only son, Nathaniel, having died in 1812 and his second wife, Rachael, in 1820.

There is no known portrait of Joseph Haslet.

==Public offices==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October. The [[Governor of Delaware |Governor]] takes office the third Tuesday of January and had a three year term.
