He defeated the Green Party's [[Matt Gonzalez]] 53% to 47% in a run-off in his race for mayor in 2003, becoming the youngest mayor of San Francisco since [[John W. Geary]].

Newsom later reflected that he did not have an easy childhood.<ref name="Port"/> Newsom attended kindergarten and first grade at the French-American bilingual school in San Francisco but transferred because of severe [[dyslexia]] that still affects him.

Tessa Newsom worked three jobs to support Gavin and his sister Hilary Newsom Callan.

Newsom attended [[Santa Clara University]] on a partial baseball scholarship and student loans, where he graduated in 1989 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]]. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since.<ref name="Way"/> He lived in the Alameda apartments which Newsom later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Socratic approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy.

On June 14, 1991, Newsom and his investors created the company PlumpJack Associates L.P. In 1992, the group started the PlumpJack Wine Shop on Fillmore Street in San Francisco with the financial help of his family friend [[Gordon Getty]]. PlumpJack was the name of an opera written by Getty, who invested in 10 of Newsom's 11 businesses.<ref name="Port"/> Getty told the San Francisco Chronicle that he treated Newsom like a son and invested in his first business venture because of that relationship. According to Getty, later business investments were because of "the success of the first."<ref name="Port"/> At the PlumpJack Cafe, Newsom gave a monthly $50 gift certificate to employees whose business ideas failed because according to him in 1997: "There can be no success without failure."<ref name="Way">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/03/11/BUSINESS14992.dtl|title=NEWSOM'S WAY He hopes business success can translate to public service By: George Raine|author=The Examiner Staff|work=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=1997-03-11|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref>

One of Newsom's early interactions with government occurred when Newsom resisted the San Francisco Health Department requirement to install a sink at his PlumpJack Wines. The Health Department argued that wine was a food. The department required the store to install a $27,000 sink in the carpeted wine shop on the grounds that the shop needed the sink for a mop. When Newsom was later appointed Supervisor, he told the [[San Francisco Examiner]]: "That's the kind of bureaucratic malaise I'm going to be working through."<ref name="Way"/>

The business grew to an enterprise with over 700 employees.<ref name="multiple"/> The PlumpJack Cafe Partners L.P. opened the PlumpJack Cafe, also on Fillmore Street, in 1993.

He maintained his ownership in the PlumpJack companies outside San Francisco that included the PlumpJack Winery in Oakville, California, new PlumpJack-owned Cade Winery in Angwin, California and the PlumpJack Squaw Valley Inn. He is currently the president in absentia of Airelle Wines Inc., which is connected to the PlumpJack Winery in Napa County. Newsom earned between $141,000 and $251,000 in 2007 from his business interests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/01/BAC1VTCK2.DTL|title=Mayor has financial holdings at Napa, Tahoe|author=Cecilia M.

==Mayoralty==
{{Main|Mayoralty of Gavin Newsom}}
[[File:GavinNewsomAtStanford.jpg|thumb|Newsom at [[Stanford University]] in 2008]]
As mayor, Newsom has focused on development projects in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]] and [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]]. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with [[universal healthcare]]. Under Newsom, San Francisco ostensibly joined the [[Kyoto Protocol]], although it could not actually join a treaty between sovereign states. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue [[same-sex marriage|marriage]] licenses to [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]], in violation of the current state law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/08/10/state/n000208D48.DTL|title=Newsom set to endorse Clinton for president|author=Lisa Leff|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2007-08-10|accessdate=2008-03-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In August 2004, the [[Supreme Court of California]] annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time.

In 2005 Newsom launched an ambitious project to bring Wi-Fi service to the entire city. He announced a partnership with [[Google WiFi]] and UnWire Now, Inc - a company led by Wi-Fi pioneer [[Jaz Banga]]. The service remains in Union Square. 

In 2009 he received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthy food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leadershipforhealthycommunities.org/content/view/284/58/|title=Top Policy Groups Take Action to Create Healthy Communities, Prevent Childhood Obesity|publisher=Leadership for Healthy Communities|date=|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> For example, in 2008, he hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/30/BA6A14C5S1.DTL|title=S.F. food policy heading in a healthy direction|first=Erin|last=Allday|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2008-11-30}}</ref> and he secured $8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp?id=82219|title=PressRoom_NewsReleases_2008_82219 <U+00AB> Office of the Mayor|publisher=Sfgov.org|date=|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. Nationally, Newsom may be best known for signing one of the country's first menu-labeling bills into law, requiring that chain restaurants prominently display nutrition and calorie information on their menus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/04/MNBG122T4F.DTL&type=printable|first=Heather|last=Knight|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2008-08-04}}</ref> San Francisco's leadership spurred the growth of the nationwide menu-labeling movement and led directly to the passage of California's statewide labeling law.

In November 2010, Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors that requires Happy Meals and other fast food with toys to meet new nutritional standards or else be removed from menus. His veto was overridden by the Board.

== Ruby Rippey-Tourk and other Controversies==

In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue [[same-sex marriage|marriage]] licenses to [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]], in violation of the current state law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/08/10/state/n000208D48.DTL|title=Newsom set to endorse Clinton for president|author=Lisa Leff|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2007-08-10|accessdate=2008-03-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In August 2004, the [[Supreme Court of California]] annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time.

In January 2007, it was revealed that Newsom had had a romantic relationship in mid-2005 with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his former deputy chief of staff and then campaign manager, Alex Tourk.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-01-31/news/17229155_1_newsom-alex-tourk-mayor-s-office|title=Aide Quits As Newsom's Affair With His Wife Is Revealed / Campaign manager confronts mayor, who is 'in shock'|author=Phil Matier, Andrew Ross, Cecilia M. Vega|work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2007-01-31|accessdate=2010-11-06}}</ref> Tourk filed for divorce shortly after the revelation and left Newsom's campaign and administration.

In 2009, Newsom came under attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of illegally harboring juvenile criminal aliens. The city was circumventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement by harboring or sending the aliens back to their own native countries. <ref> {{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/keyword/sanctuary-city/featured/2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=<a title="S.F.

==Proposition 8==
During the 2008 election, Newsom was a prominent and vocal opponent of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], the ballot initiative to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/state&id=6477948|title=San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom fights for same-sex marriage &#124; abc7news.com|publisher=Abclocal.go.com|date=2008-10-29|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>

==Lieutenant Governor==
{{See also|California lieutenant gubernatorial election, 2010}}
In April Newsom announced his intention to run for Governor of California in the 2010 Election. In September 2009, former president Bill Clinton announced he was endorsing Newsom for his run. In June, Newsom remarked that, if elected Governor, he'd like to be referred to as "The Gavinator" (a [[portmanteau]] of "Gavin" and "Terminator" and reference to "The [[Governator]]", a common nickname for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger). Throughout the campaign, Newsom suffered low poll numbers, trailing Democratic front-runner [[Jerry Brown]] by more than 20 points in most polls.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-08-24/bay-area/17175365_1_jerry-brown-san-francisco-mayor-san-franciscans|title=CAMPAIGN 2010 / Mayor Newsom wants to move on up to the governor's place / Campaign expected to be very crowded and very expensive|first1=Phillip|last1=Matier|first2=Andrew|last2=Ross|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2009-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=November 12, 2008|url=http://johnnycalifornia.com/2008/11/12/governor-2010-new-field-poll-things-look-bad-for-newsom-not-so-bad-for-feinsteinvillaraigosa/|title=Governor 2010: New Field Poll - Things Look Bad For Newsom, Not So Bad for Feinstein and Villaraigosa|publisher=Johnny California|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/31/local/me-newsom-out31|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Gavin Newsom drops out of California governor's race|first1=Mark Z.|last1=Barabak|first2=Evan|last2=Halper|date=2009-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/california/election_2010_california_governor_election]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/us/31newsom.html|work=The New York Times|title=San Francisco Mayor Drops Governor Bid|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|date=2009-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garofoli|first=Joe|url=http://sfchronicle.us/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?blogid=14&entry_id=49142|title=Newsom: "Mark my words: These poll numbers will change dramatically"...d'oh!!! : SFGate: Politics Blog|publisher=Sfchronicle.us|date=2009-10-08|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/AgXG97/www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/oct/05/poll-puts-brown-in-the-lead/|title=poll-puts-brown-in-the-lead from venturacountystar.com|publisher=StumbleUpon|date=|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> In October 2009, Newsom dropped out of the Governor race.<ref>{{cite web|last=Selway|first=William|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a0jLxmmMJdmU&refer=us|title=San Francisco Mayor Joins Race for California Governor in 2010|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-09-09/news/the-wrong-stuff] Harrell,Ashley.

In February 2010 Newsom filed initial paperwork to run for Lieutenant Governor of California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=75568|title=Gavin Newsom, San Francisco mayor, files papers in lieutenant governor race &#124; News10.net &#124; Sacramento, California &#124; Local News|publisher=News10.net|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> Newsom stated on a February edition of ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' that this move did not assure that he would run, but that he was simply keeping his options open considering that he would reach his term limits in 2011. In March he announced his candidacy for the office.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In June 2010 he received the Democratic nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of California|Lieutenant Governor]].<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"/> He won the election on November 2, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/11/03/brown-newsom-boxer-elected/|title=Brown, Newsom, Boxer elected|accessdate=2010-03-11|publisher=The Stanford Daily}}</ref>

Newsom was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor, on January 10, 2011. The one-week delay was to ensure that a successor as mayor of San Francisco was chosen before he left office. [[Edwin M. Lee]], the city administrator, took office the day after Newsom was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor.

==Personal life==
[[File:Gavin Newsom and Jennifer Siebel at the 2008 Gay Parade.jpg|thumb|left|Newsom and Jennifer Siebel at the 2008 [[San Francisco Pride]] parade.]]
Newsom was baptized and reared [[Roman Catholic]]. He describes himself as an "Irish-Catholic rebel...in some respects, but one that still has tremendous admiration for the Church and very strong faith."  When asked about the current state of the Catholic Church in an interview, he said the church was in crisis. Newsom said he stays with the Church because of his "strong connection to a greater purpose, and&nbsp;... higher being&nbsp;..."  Newsom identifies himself as a practicing Roman Catholic,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-03-03/bay-area/17287812_1_scientology-press-briefings-human-rights|title=DOWN BY THE BAY / A blues story with all the requisite elements: love, booze and death|first=Rachel|last=Gordon|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2006-03-03}}</ref> stating that he has a "strong sense of faith that is perennial: day in and day out."<ref name="Santa"/>

In December 2001, Newsom married [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]], a former San Francisco [[prosecutor]] and legal commentator for [[Court TV]], [[CNN]], and [[MSNBC]], and who now hosts ''[[The Lineup (TV program)|The Lineup]]'' and also appears on various other shows, including ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on [[Fox News Channel]]. The couple married at [[Saint Ignatius Church (San Francisco)|Saint Ignatius Catholic Church]] on the campus of the [[University of San Francisco]], where Guilfoyle attended [[University of San Francisco School of Law|law school]].
