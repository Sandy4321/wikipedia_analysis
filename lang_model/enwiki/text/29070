The '''redback spider''' (''Latrodectus hasseltii'') is a [[species]] of venomous spider [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australia. It is a member of the worldwide genus ''[[Latrodectus]]'', the widow spiders. The female is easily recognisable by her black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen. Females have a body length of about {{convert|1|cm|sigfig=1}}, while the male is smaller, being only 3<U+2013>4&nbsp;mm (0.12<U+2013>0.16&nbsp;in) long.

The female spider lives in an untidy web in warm sheltered locations, and preys on insects, spiders and lizards that it entraps, but it can live for over 100 days without food. It is preyed upon by other species of spider and [[parasitoid]] wasps. The redback is one of few arachnids which usually display [[sexual cannibalism]] while mating. The sperm is then stored in [[spermathecae]], [[organ (biology)|organs]] of the female reproductive tract, and can be used to lay several round white egg sacs.

The redback is one of the most dangerous species of spider. It has a widespread distribution in Australia, and colonies have also been established in a number of other countries. It is especially found co-located with humans and is responsible for the large majority of Australian spider bites with serious medical consequences. Its venom is [[neurotoxic]] to humans, with a small fraction of [[Spider bite#Spider venom|bites]] causing [[latrodectism]] which includes severe pain, often lasting over 24 hours. An [[antivenom]] is commercially available, and since its introduction in 1956, no deaths directly due to redback bites have been formally recorded.

==Taxonomy and naming==

Arachnologist [[Herbert Walter Levi]] revised the genus ''Lactrodectus'' in 1959, studying the female sexual organs and noting their similarity across described species. He concluded the colour variations were variable across the world and were not sufficient to warrant species status, and reclassified the redback and several other species as subspecies of the black widow spider.<ref name="levi 1959">{{cite journal|last=Levi, Herbert Walter |year=1959|title=The Spider Genus ''Latrodectus'' (Araneae, Theridiidae)|journal=Transactions of the American Microscopical Society|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7<U+2013>43|jstor=3223799}}</ref>

===Current placement===
A member of the genus ''[[Latrodectus]]'' in the family [[Theridiidae]], the redback belongs in a [[clade]] with the best-known member of the group, the black widow spider (''[[Latrodectus mactans]]''), found in North America and other regions.<ref name="garb 2004"/> The katipo is the redback's closest relative.<ref name="vink"/> A 2004 molecular study supports the redback's status as distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating.<ref name="garb 2004"/>

The close relationship between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[offspring]]. However, the male katipo can not mate with the female redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a [[predatory]] response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs.<ref name="Riordan">{{cite web | title =Species Profile: Katipo spider | first= Hilary Ann |last=Riordan |publisher = CanterburyNature| month = July | year = 2005 | url =http://www.canterburynature.org/species/lincoln_essays/katipo.php | accessdate = May 27, 2008}}</ref> There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.<ref name="vink">{{cite journal |last1=Vink|first1=Cor J.|last2=Sirvid|first2=Phil J.|last3=Malumbres-Olarte|first3=Jagoba|last4=Griffiths|first4=James W.|last5=Paquin|first5=Pierre|last6=Paterson|first6=Adrian M. |title=Species status and conservation issues of New Zealand's endemic ''Latrodectus'' spider species (Araneae: Theridiidae) |journal=[[Invertebrate Systematics]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=589<U+2013>604 |year=2008 |doi=10.1071/IS08027 |issn=1445-5226 |oclc=50150601 |publisher=[[CSIRO]] Publishing |location=[[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood, Vic.]], Australia}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:RedbackPottingMix.JPG|thumb|left|A juvenile female, showing typical white banding]]
[[File:Red back underside.jpg|thumb|right|The ventral side of an adult female, showing the red hourglass]]
The adult female redback has a round body about {{convert|1|cm|sigfig=1}} long, with long, slender legs. The body is a deep black colour (occasionally brownish), with a red (sometimes orange) longitudinal stripe on the upper [[abdomen]]. On the underside of the abdomen is an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak.<ref name="Amo-Redback"/> Redback spiderlings are grey with dark spots, and become darker with each [[Moulting|moult]].<ref name=SMH1907/> The female red stripe also develops through this process, starting as a red spot, then multiple spots which later merge.<ref name=SMH1907/> Juvenile females have additional white markings on the abdomen.<ref name="Amo-Redback"/>
 
The male redback is 3<U+2013>4&nbsp;mm (0.12<U+2013>0.16&nbsp;in) long and is light brown in colour, with white markings on the upper side of the abdomen and a pale hourglass marking on the underside.<ref name="Amo-Redback">{{cite web | author=Australian Museum | title=Redback Spider Fact Sheet | url=http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/Redback-Spider/ | accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>

Another species in Australia with a similar physique, ''[[Steatoda capensis]]'', has been termed the "false redback spider", but it is uniformly black (or plum), and does not display the red stripe.<ref name=Warden1989>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Warden |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article118118613 |title=Red-back spider that is not. |newspaper=[[Canberra Times|The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 <U+2013> 1995)]] |location=ACT |date=12 February 1987  |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[File:Female redback spider.jpg|thumb|right|A redback spider sitting in its web]]

===Web===
The redback stays concealed during the day, and the female spins a web during the night,<ref name=SMH1907/> usually in the same location for most of its adult life.<ref name=Andrade2002/> The web is a disorganised, irregular tangle of fine but strong silk. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments.<ref name="Amo-Redback"/> The vertical strands serve two purposes, it snares prey and small insects and can be lifted in the air, and secondly acts as a trip wire to alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats.<ref name=AWV_youtube>{{cite web|title=Web Design...

[[File:Redback vers Lizard.jpg|thumb|left|A redback spider with a lizard it has captured]]

===Prey===
Redbacks usually prey on insects, but can capture larger animals that become entangled in the web, including [[king crickets]], [[trapdoor spider]]s, and small [[lizard]]s.<ref name="AustMus"/> The slater (''[[Porcellio scaber]]'') is a particularly common food item,{{sfn|McKeown|1963|p=193}} while one web was recorded with a dead mouse within.{{sfn|McKeown|1963|p=144}} Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings their hunters.{{sfn|Brunet|1997|p=148}} Commonly, prey-stealing occurs where larger females take food items stored in other spiders' webs.<ref name="Amo-Redback"/> When they encounter other spiders of the same species, often including those of the opposite sex, they engage in battle, and the defeated spider is eaten.<ref name=SMH1907/> If the male is accepted by a female, it is permitted to feed on the victims snared in the female's web.<ref name=SMH1907/>

===Predators and parasitoids===
The daddy-long-legs spider (''[[Pholcus phalangioides]]'') and the giant daddy-long-legs spider (''[[Artema atlanta]]'') are known to prey on the redback spider.<ref>{{cite web|title=Redback Spider|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Spiders/Modern+Spiders+Infraorder+Araneomorphae/Redback+and+Brown+Widow+spiders/Redback+Spider|publisher=[[Queensland Museum]]|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>   ''[[Agenioideus nigricornis]]'', a [[spider wasp]], is a [[parasitoid]] of the adult redback.<ref name=Krogmann/>  Other [[Hymenoptera|wasps]] of the families [[Eurytomidae]] and [[Ichneumonidae]] have been recorded parisitising redback eggs, and mantid lacewings ([[Neuroptera]] and [[Mantispidae]]) preying on redback eggs.<ref name=Krogmann>{{cite journal |last1=Krogmann |first1=Lars |last2=Austin |first2=Andrew D.|year=2011 |title=Systematics of Australian ''Agenioideus'' Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) with the first record of a spider wasp parasitizing ''Latrodectus hasselti'' Thorell (redback spider). |journal=Australian Journal of Entomology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=166<U+2013>174 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.2011.00850.x}}</ref>

Young redback spiders leave the maternal web by being carried on the wind. The spider extends its abdomen high in the air and produces a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long [[Spider silk|gossamer]] thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web.<ref name=AustMus/>

===Reproduction===
[[File:Latrodectus hasselti male and female.png|thumb|upright=2.0|right|Female redback guarding egg sac, note the male at left (''circled'')]]
Before a juvenile male leaves its mother's web, it builds a small sperm web on which it deposits its sperm from its gonads and then collects it back into its palp (copulatory organ), because the gonads and palp are not internally connected.<ref name=Andrade2002/> Unmated sexually-mature female redback spiders secrete [[pheremone]]s including a [[serine]] derivative (N-3-methylbutyryl-O-(S)-2-methylbutyryl-L-serine '''3''') onto their web.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jerhot|first=Elena|coauthors=Stoltz, Jeffrey<U+2005>A.; Andrade, Maydianne<U+2005>C.<U+2005>B.; Schulz, Stefan|title=Acylated Serine Derivatives: A Unique Class of Arthropod Pheromones of the Australian Redback Spider, Latrodectus hasselti|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=8 March 2010|volume=49|issue=11|pages=2037<U+2013>2040|doi=10.1002/anie.200906312}}</ref> This is thought to be the sole method by which males assess a female's reproductive status, and their courtship dismantles much of the pheremone-marked web.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stoltz|first=Jeffrey A.|coauthors=McNeil, Jeremy N.; Andrade, Maydianne C.

The redback spider is one of only two animals to date where the male has been found to actively assist the female in [[sexual cannibalism]]. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1071/ZO9920001}}</ref>  Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the males. The first is the eating process allows for a longer period of copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Maydianne C.

Some redback males have been observed using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm to the organs without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult within a few days and deliver a normal clutch of eggs.<ref>{{cite conference | author=Biaggio, M. D.; Andrade, M. C.

==Distribution and habitat==

The redback spider's origins are uncertain, and it may have been spread by human activities. The species was known by 1850 in South Australia, only 14 years after European settlement there, but was not reported in early spider collections in other colonies.<ref name="distributions paper"/> Because it was first found at seaports, it has even been suggested that the redback may not be native to Australia.<ref name="garb 2004">{{cite journal|last=Garb|first=Jessica E.|coauthors=Gonz<U+00E1>lez, Alda; Gillespie, Rosemary G.|title=The black widow spider genus Latrodectus (Araneae: Theridiidae): phylogeny, biogeography, and invasion history|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|year=2004|month=June|volume=31|issue=3|pages=1127<U+2013>1142|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2003.10.012|url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/~gillespie/Publications_files/GarbGonzGillMPE.pdf}}</ref> Outside urban areas, the redback is more often found in dryer habitats ranging from [[sclerophyll]] forest to desert, even as harsh as the [[Simpson Desert]].{{sfn|Brunet|1997|p=148}} It became much more common in urban areas in the early decades of the 20th century,{{sfn|McKeown|1963|p=188}} and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities.{{sfn|Brunet|1997|p=148}} The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences.

==Bites==
===Prevalence===
The redback and its kin in the genus ''Lactrodectus'' are among the most dangerous spider genera, alongside funnel-web spiders (''[[Atrax]]'' and ''[[Hadronyche]]''), banana spiders (''[[Phoneutria]]'') and recluse spiders (''[[Loxosceles]]'').<ref name="Amo-Redback">{{cite web | author=Australian Museum | title=Spider Facts | url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Spider-facts | accessdate=20 September 2013|date=6 May 2013}}</ref> Hundreds<ref name="distributions paper"/> or thousands of people are thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia.<ref name=White1998/> Of all Australian spider bites with significant medical effects, redbacks are responsible for a large majority.<ref name="bite study"/> The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of redback spider bites in humans.<ref name="isbister"/> The bite of a juvenile female appears to have similar potency to that of a mature female.<ref name="isbister"/> The smaller male spider was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although male bites have been reported. The rarity of male bite reports is probably due to the male's smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking venom of potency similar to the female's. Cases have shown the male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain.<ref name="isbister"/> Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening.<ref name="isbister"/><ref name="sutherland">{{cite journal |author=Sutherland, S.; Trinca, J. |title=Survey of 2144 cases of Redback spider bites: Australia and New Zealand, 1963<U+2014>1976 |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |volume=2 |issue=14 |pages=620<U+2013>623 |year=1978 |pmid=732670}}</ref> As the female redback is slow-moving, and rarely leaves its web, bites generally occur as a result of a person placing a hand or other body part too close to the web, such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities.

===Toxicology===
Venom is produced by glands in the cephalothorax, and expelled venom travels through paired ducts from the cephalothorax, exiting through the tip of the spider's hollow fangs. The venom of the redback spider is thought to be similar to other ''Latrodectus'' spiders, and contains a number of high-molecular-weight proteins, one of which, [[alpha-latrotoxin]] (a [[neurotoxin]]), is active in humans.<ref name="NicholsonGraudins">{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Graham M.|last2=Graudins|first2=Andis|title=Spiders of medical importance in the Asia-Pacific: Atracotoxin, latrotoxin and related spider neurotoxins|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=29|issue=9|year=2002|pages=785<U+2013>794|issn=0305-1870|pmid= 12165044| doi=10.1046/j.1440-1681.2002.03741.x}}</ref> In [[vertebrates]], alpha-latrotoxin produces its effect through destabilization of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in the release of neurotransmitters; it causes uncontrolled release of [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]].

===Symptoms===
Bites from redback spiders produce a syndrome known as [[latrodectism]], with symptoms similar to bites from other ''Latrodectus'' spiders. The syndrome is generally characterised by extreme pain.<ref name="Slaughter">{{cite journal |author=Slaughter, R. J.; Beasley, D. M.; Lambie, B. S.; Schep, L.

===Treatment===
Treatment is based on the severity of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine [[analgesic]]s.
