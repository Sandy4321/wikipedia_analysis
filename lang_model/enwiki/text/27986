While beer was an early part of colonial life in the United States, [[Prohibition]] in the early [[20th century]] caused nearly all American breweries to close. After it was repealed, the industry was dominated by a consolidated number of large-scale breweries. The big breweries that bounced back from prohibition produce the majority of the beer today. The majority of the new breweries in the US are craft or micro breweries, called brewpubs when they also serve food on the premises. The most common [[Beer style|style of beer]] in the United States is an [[American lager|American-style pale lager]] modeled off of the [[Pilsner]] style, while craft breweries increasingly brew beer inspired by the traditional styles of [[Beer in Germany|Germany]], [[Beer in Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Beer in England|Great Britain]]. <ref>[http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/catdex.php BJCP 2008 Style Guidelines - Index<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/publications/beer-style-guidelines Brewers Association | Beer Style Guidelines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]] brewed beer in the lands of the United States prior to European arrival. One recipe was composed of [[maize]], [[birch]] [[sap]] and water.<ref name=early>Jackson (1977), p.208</ref> The earliest record of brewing by non-Native peoples dates from 1587, and the first commercial brewery opened in the United States was at the [[Dutch West India Company]] of Lower Manhattan in 1632.<ref name=early/>

The brewing traditions of [[English beer|England]] and the [[Dutch beer|Netherlands]] (as brought to New York) ensured that colonial drinking would be dominated by beer rather than wine. Until the middle of the 19th century, British-style [[ale|ales]] dominated American brewing.  This changed when the [[lager]] styles, brought by German immigrants, turned out to be more profitable for large-scale manufacturing and shipping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/schaefer_anderson.shtml |title=F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co., Brooklyn, New York |publisher=Beerhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> Lager was also preferred due to its longevity, while local ales of the time quickly turned sour and were a perceived risk to drink.<ref>Ogle (2006), p.15-16</ref>

The lager brewed by these companies was originally based on several different styles of central Europe, but the Pilsener style, using mild Czech hops, pale, lightly roasted [[Barley#Two row and six row barley|6-row barley]] and often [[adjuncts]] such as rice and corn, gradually won out.<ref>Ogle (2006), p.74-75</ref>

[[Steam beer]], the first style of beer to originate in the United States, evolved in the [[San Francisco]] area during the 19th century. After Prohibition ended, the [[Anchor Brewing Company]] was the sole producer of steam beer.<ref name=smith>Smith, Brad. [http://www.beersmith.com/blog/2008/06/11/steam-beer-and-california-common-recipes-beer-styles/ Steam Beer and California Common Recipes: Beer Styles]. BeerSmith.com. June 11, 2008. Retrieved 2011-3-9.</ref> The company was near closure in 1965, whereupon [[Fritz Maytag]], great-grandson of the [[Maytag Corporation]] founder, rescued the brewery and with it the steam beer style.<ref>Jackson (1977), p.215</ref> Anchor has since trademarked the term "Steam Beer" and all subsequent renditions of the style are now termed California Common.<ref name=smith/>

[[D.G. Yuengling & Son]], commonly called Yuengling (pronounced "ying-ling"), is the oldest operating brewing company in the United States, having been established in 1829, and is one of the largest breweries by volume in the country. It is currently the second-largest American-owned brewery after the [[Boston Beer Company]]. Its headquarters is in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yuengling.com/ |title=Yuengling America's Oldest Brewery &#124; beer &#124; merchandise &#124; club &#124; TV |publisher=Yuengling.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

[[File:Best South side Brewery, Virginia Street, Milwaukee, Wis, by Woodward, C. W. (Charles Warren).jpg|left|thumb|Best Brewing Co., Virginia Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, circa 1885]]
One of the earliest large-scale brewers was [[Best Brewing]], a [[Milwaukee]] brewery built by German immigrant [[Phillip Best]] in the 1840s. It began shipping its beer to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis]] the following decade, first by ferry and eventually by rail, establishing an early trans-market beer brand in the United States.<ref>Ogle (2006), p.17-19</ref>
Other successful breweries of the era begun by German immigrants in Milwaukee included the [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company]], [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]], and the [[Miller Brewing Company]], owned [[Frederick Miller]], who took on the brewery which had originally been owned by Phillip Best's brother, Carl.<ref>Ogle (2006), p.34-36</ref>

In St. Louis, a prosperous German soap maker, [[Eberhard Anheuser]], purchased a struggling brewery in 1860. His daughter married a brewery supplier, [[Adolphus Busch]], who took over the company after his father-in-law's death, and renamed it [[Anheuser-Busch]]. Busch soon toured Europe, discovering the success of [[Pilsner|Bohemian lager]], and introduced [[Budweiser]] beer (named after a beer brewed in the town of [[Budweis]] in [[Bohemia]]) in 1876.<ref name=bud>Jackson (1977), p.210</ref> Anheuser-Busch, and its Budweiser beer, would go on to be the largest brewery and beer brand in the world.<ref name=bud/> The company innovated the use of refrigeration in rail cars to transport its beers, which helped make bottled Budweiser the first national beer brand in the United States.<ref>Jackson (1977), p.204</ref>

===Prohibition===
[[File:Detroit police prohibition.jpg|right|thumb|Detroit Police discover an underground brewery during Prohibition]]
On January 16, 1919, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was enacted into law, creating the [[Prohibition]] era, wherein the production, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages was made illegal. All legal American brewing came to a halt when Prohibition was imposed, though the earlier [[temperance movement]] had already reduced the number of breweries significantly.  Only a few breweries, mainly the largest, were able to stay in business by manufacturing [[near beer]], malt syrup, or other non-alcohol grain products, in addition to soft drinks such as colas and [[root beer]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grace |first=Roger M. |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2005/reminiscing070705.htm |title=Breweries Survive Prohibition by Selling Malt Extract |publisher=Metropolitan News-Enterprise |accessdate=2011-4-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/page/page/1636447.htm |title=Dayton Breweries During Prohibition |publisher=Dayton History Books Online |accessdate=2011-4-24}}</ref> Production and shipping of alcohol was largely confined to illegal operations that could deliver compact [[distilled beverage]]s&nbsp;<U+2014> smuggled [[rum]] and domestic [[moonshine]]&nbsp;<U+2014> more efficiently and reliably than bulkier products such as beer.

American Prohibition was repealed by degrees.  First, the [[Volstead Act]] defining "intoxicating liquors", was amended in April 1933 by the  [[Cullen-Harrison Act]] to provide that beer with a strength of up to 3.2% alcohol was not "intoxicating", and thus not prohibited.<ref>Cullen-Harrison Act.</ref>  Within 24 hours of legalization, as much as 1.5 million barrels of 3.2% beer was sold, causing some to predict a "beer famine".<ref>[http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-04-08/bay-area/17191290_1_beer-happy-days-alcohol From the archives: 'Beer famine' threatens U.S.]. SFGate.com. April 8, 2009. Retrieved 2011-3-26.</ref> Soon thereafter, in December of the same year, the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealed Prohibition in general, but left the production of alcoholic beverages heavily regulated by federal, state, and local authorities. Included in this regulation was the imposition of a [[Three-tier (alcohol distribution)|three-tier distribution]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mndistributors.com/facts.cfm |title=Value of the three-tier system |publisher=Beer, Wine & Spirits Distributors of Minnesota |accessdate=2011-4-23}}</ref>

===Post-Prohibition===
Although the Twenty-first Amendment allowed brewers to legally resume practicing their craft, many [[Dry county|"dry" counties]] remained and many states failed to ratify altogether, which slowed the resurgence of the brewing industry.  In addition, the many prohibitionists of the temperance movement were still quite vocal and were able to retain a large following despite the repealing of the 18th amendment.  Before the American beer industry could attempt to re-establish itself, [[World War II]] began. This further inhibited the re-emergence of smaller breweries because much of the grain supply was rationed due to the war, forcing the breweries to use adjuncts such as corn and rice alongside the barley traditionally used in brewing.  The prohibitionists saw a tantalizing opportunity to quell the efforts of remaining breweries, insisting that the commercial brewing of beer squandered manpower, grain, fuel and cargo space that should have gone towards the war effort overseas.<ref name="Jacobson, Lisa 2009, p275-312">Jacobson, Lisa.  <U+201C>Beer Goes to War:  The Politics of Beer Promotion and Production in the Second World War,<U+201D> Food, Culture & Society; September 2009, Vol. 12 Issue 3, p275-312</ref> Brewers responded to these accusations by extolling the benefits that [[brewer's yeast]] have on human health, namely, their high [[vitamin B]] content.  It was argued that the increase in [[thiamine]] in the diets of the soldiers and factory workers would improve performance on the battlefield as well as in the factory and that this increase sufficiently justified the need for beer.  The American government decided that the benefits of the vitamin B in brewers yeast, alongside the taxes coming in from beer sales were enough to justify a request for fifteen percent of beer production for servicemen.<ref>Rudin, Max.  <U+201C>Beer and America,<U+201D>  American Heritage; June/July 2002, Vol. 53, Issue 3</ref>

Although America<U+2019>s breweries had the backing of their government, they still needed to capture the hearts and the wallets of the American people.  In order to accomplish this, the major breweries banded together and launched the <U+201C>Morale is a Lot of Little Things<U+201D> advertising campaign.<ref name="Jacobson, Lisa 2009, p275-312"/>  The campaign can be well summarized from the following 1942 magazine advertisement:

<blockquote><U+201C>If you<U+2019>re a man, it<U+2019>s a shine on your shoes ... the sweet feel of a fly rod in your hand ... If you<U+2019>re a woman, it<U+2019>s a tricky new hair-do maybe ... or a change of lipstick. Morale is a lot of little things like that. People can take the big bad things ... the bitter news, the bombings even ... if only a few of the little, familiar, comforting good things are left.<U+201D> <ref>Morale is a Lot of Little Things,<U+201D> advertising proof sheet, June 1942</ref></blockquote>

	From the time America entered the war in 1941 until it ended in 1945, the overall production of beer increased by over 40% despite the small number of active breweries.<ref name="Jacobson, Lisa 2009, p275-312"/> This wartime growth allowed the large breweries such as Anheuser-Busch to dominate the American market for over fifty years. During this period they produced beers more noted for their uniformity than for any particular flavor. Beers such as those made by Anheuser-Busch and [[Coors Brewing Company]] followed a restricted pilsner style, with large-scale industrial processes and the use of low-cost ingredients like corn or ingredients such as rice that provided starch for alcohol production while contributing minimal flavor to the finished product. The dominance of the so-called "macrobrew" led to an international stereotype of "American beer" as poor in quality and flavor. However, in recent years the major brewers have made attempts at developing premium beers in the European tradition such as [[Killian's Irish Red]].

==Economy==
In 1978, President [[Jimmy Carter]] legalized the [[homebrewing|private brewing of beer in one's home]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/09/06/PN29800.DTL |author=Marshall Wilson |title=Peninsula Homebrewers Hop on the Beer Wagon |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 6, 1996 |accessdate=2011-6-28}}</ref> This change, along with the emergence of new [[microbrewery|microbreweries]] such as [[New Albion Brewing Company|New Albion]] and [[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company|Sierra Nevada]] in Norther California, led to a growth of manufacture and interest in beer in the 1980s, which continues to this day. Due to the resurgence of the commercial [[craft brewing]] industry in the 1980s, the United States now features many beers, offered by over 1400 [[brewpub]]s, microbreweries, and regional brewers. However, the majority of beer sales in the United States are still for [[pale lager]] produced by national and international brewing companies.

While in volume the macrobrews still dominate, smaller producers brew in a variety of styles influenced by local sources of hops and other ingredients as well as by various European traditions.  The success of the commercial craft brewing industry has led the large breweries to invest in smaller breweries such as [[Widmer Brothers]] and [[Goose Island]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Noel |first=Josh |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-03-28/features/chi-goose-island-brewery-selling-20110328_1_anheuser-busch-creativity-local-beer-scene |title=Goose Island's John Hall promises commitment to creativity won't change |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=March 28 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref>, and to develop more complex beers of their own.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.anheuser-busch.com/press/american-ale-09-15-08.html |title=Available to sip and savor: Budweiser American Ale |publisher=Anheuser-Busch |date=September 15 2008 |accessdate=April 22,2011}}</ref>

Nearly 80 percent of [[convenience stores]] sell beer, accounting for nearly one-third of all beer purchased in the United States, about 93 percent of which is sold cold. The U.S. convenience store industry sells more than 2 billion gallons of beer a year <U+2013> roughly one-third of all the beer purchased in the Unites States. (In 2007, U.S. consumption was 6.7 billion gallons.)<ref>[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/News/FactSheets/MerchandiseandServices/Pages/BeerSalesatConvenienceStores.aspx Fact Sheets: Beer Sales]</ref>

Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage in America and accounts for about 85% of the volume of alcoholic beverages sold in the United States each year. As of 2009, the top three beer companies in the US were [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[MillerCoors]], and [[Pabst Brewing Company]].<ref>[http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/media/press-releases/show?title=brewers-association-releases-2009-top-50-breweries-list Brewers Association Releases 2009 Top 50 Breweries Lists].

==Beer styles==
The best selling style of beer made in the US is [[American lager|American-style]] [[pale lager]], which is made by most large-scale brewers, including [[Anheuser<U+2013>Busch InBev]] and [[MillerCoors]]. 

These large-scale, or "macro", companies also brew popular styles which descend from the pale lager. [[Light beer]], which was introduced on a large scale by Miller Brewing Company in the early 1970s, is a beer made with reduced alcohol and/or carbohydrate content, and has grown to eclipse many of the original pale lager brands in sales. Bud Light, brewed by Anheuser-Busch InBev, is the top-selling beer in the United States. [[Ice beer#Ice beer|Ice beer]] is an example which has been partially [[freeze distillation|freeze-distilled]] with the intention of concentrating flavor and alcohol. The technique is based on that used to make [[Eisbock]], but the two styles share no stylistic similarities (apart from both being lagers) otherwise. [[Dry beer]], a Japanese style based on American lager, is also brewed by some American companies. In dry beer, the yeast is encouraged to consume more fermentables, resulting in a crisper finish and an unusually subtle hop flavor.
[[Malt liquor]] is a high-ABV version of American pale lager. It has often incited controversy due to its alcohol content, larger-sized containers, low prices, and advertising frequently targeting inner-city neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite news |last=Emert |first=Carol |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/02/20/BU81844.DTL |title=S.F. Brewery Yanks Beer Ads in Harlem |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 20 1999 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Marriott |first=Michel |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/for-minority-youths-40-ounces-of-trouble.html |title=For Minority Youths, 40 Ounces of Trouble |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 16 1993 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>

Other beer styles, often brewed by craft & micro brewers, indigenous to the United States include [[California common beer]] or "steam beer", [[amber ale]], [[blonde ale]] and [[cream ale]]. Adapted styles with distinct American variations include [[pale ale]], [[India Pale Ale]], [[red ale]], [[brown ale]], [[stout]], [[Barley wine|barleywine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.craftbeer.com/pages/style-finder/american-ales |title=CraftBeer.com | American Ales |publisher=www.craftbeer.com |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}</ref>

Belgian beer styles have also been adapted by American craft breweries, including [[saison]], [[dubbel]], [[tripel]], and [[Belgian strong ale]].<ref name=sawyer>{{cite news |last=Sawyer |first=Christopher |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/05/08/WI261408.DTL |title=U.S. acquiring a taste for Belgian ales |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=May 8 2003 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref> The lighter of these (saison, golden strong ale and tripel) beers have soft malt flavors and mild to strong "spicy" characteristics that come from yeast or the addition of spices. The darker of these beers (dubbel and dark strong ale) may have flavors of dried fruit that derives from the malts, yeast and sugar used to make them. All of these beers are high in carbonation and low in hop character. [[Witbier]], a style nearly extinct until reintroduced by Belgian brewer [[Pierre Celis]] in the 1960s, is brewed by MillerCoors as [[Blue Moon (beer)|Blue Moon]], and is one of the top-selling craft beer styles in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Manners |first=Tim |url=http://www.reveries.com/2006/11/blue-moon-beer/ |title=Blue Moon Beer |publisher=reveries.com |accessdate=2011-4-23}}</ref>
