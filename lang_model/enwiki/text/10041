'''Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia''', estimated to number about 7.5 million as of April 2013,<ref>{{cite news|title=New plan to nab illegals revealed|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/448234|newspaper=[[Arab News]]|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref> began migrating to the country soon after oil was discovered in the late 1930s. Initially, the main influx was composed of Arab and [[Western world|Western]] technical, professional and administrative personnel, but subsequently substantial numbers came from Southeast Asia. [[Saudi Arabia]] has become increasingly dependent on foreign labour, and although foreign workers remain present in technical positions, most are now employed in the agriculture, cleaning and domestic service industries. The hierarchy of foreign workers is often dependent on their country of origin; workers from Arab and Western countries generally hold the highest positions not held by Saudis, and the lower positions are occupied by persons from Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. The Saudi government has faced criticism from legal bodies and employers over the treatment of foreign workers.

==Background and history==
{{See also|History of Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia was one of the poorest and most undeveloped countries in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Affluence and poverty in the Middle East|last=El Ghonemy|first=Mohamad Riad|year=1998|isbn=978-0-415-10033-5|page=56}}</ref> The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by [[Western world|Western]] oil companies.<ref name=Gibney403>{{cite book|title=Immigration and Asylum: From 1900 to the Present|last=Gibney |first= Matthew J.|coauthors= Hansen, Randall|year=2005|isbn= 978-1576077962|pages=403}}</ref> A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref name= Gibney404>{{cite book |title=Immigration and Asylum: From 1900 to the Present|last=Gibney |first= Matthew J.|coauthors= Hansen, Randall|year=2005|isbn=978-1576077962|pages=404}}</ref> Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally [[Palestine|Palestinians]], [[Egypt]]ians, [[Yemen]]is and others from Arab countries, but also [[Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia|Pakistanis]] and [[Indians in Saudi Arabia|Indians]], leading to a doubling of the Saudi population by 1985.<ref name= Gibney404/> Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as [[Thailand]], [[Filipinos in Saudi Arabia|Philippines]] and [[South Korea]], increasingly provided migrant workers.<ref name= Gibney404/>

From 1985 the declining oil price led to a decreased demand for foreign labour, resulting in a substantial drop in migration from Asia.<ref name= Gibney404/> However, at the same time, there was a significant increase of female "[[Guest worker program|guest workers]]" from [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], Philippines and [[Indonesians in Saudi Arabia|Indonesia]] who filled roles in the services sector&nbsp;<U+2013> particularly in hotels and as domestic servants.<ref name= Gibney404/> The [[Gulf War]] of 1991 sparked a series of expulsions of guest workers suspected of disloyalty, including the removal of 800,000 Yemenis.<ref name= Gibney405>{{cite book|title=Immigration and Asylum: From 1900 to the Present|last=Gibney |first= Matthew J.|coauthors= Hansen, Randall|year=2005|isbn= 978-1576077962|page=405}}</ref> The numbers of foreign workers reached a plateau in the 1990s, but from the end of the decade the inflow of migrants resumed its increase.<ref>{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia: Power, Legitimacy and Survival|last=Niblock|first=Tim|year=2006|isbn=978-0415303101|page=75}}</ref> According to official figures in 2012, foreign workers filled 66 per cent of jobs in Saudi Arabia, despite an official unemployment rate of 12 per cent amongst Saudis, and expatriates sent, on average, US$18 billion each year, in remittances to their home countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia pays a price for crackdown on foreign workers|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/african-and-mideast-business/saudi-arabia-pays-a-price-for-crackdown-on-foreign-workers/article11000421/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=11 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref>

Although the country's reliance on foreign workers has been a concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s,<ref name= Gibney403/> the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs.<ref name= rasheed>{{cite book|title=A History of Saudi Arabia|last=al-Rasheed|first=Madawi|year=2002|isbn=978-0521644129|page=152}}</ref> This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which has been criticized for its emphasis on religion and [[rote learning]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia's Education Reforms Emphasize Training for Jobs|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Saudi-Arabias-Education/124771/|newspaper=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=3 October 2010|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks.<ref name= rasheed/> In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of [[Saudization]], replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi.<ref name= Gibney405/> In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Saudi enigma: A History|last=Menoret|first=Pascal|coauthors=Camiller, Patrick|year=2005|isbn=978-1842776056|page=xiii}}</ref> Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.<ref name="Cordesman">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.id/books?id=tjpExwQWtOsC|title=Saudi Arabia Enters the Twenty-First Century: The Political, Foreign Policy, Economic, and Energy Dimensions|last=Cordesman|first= Anthony H. |location=Westport|publisher=Praeger |year=2003|isbn=978-0-313-01624-0|pages=271<U+2013>273}}</ref>

The Saudi government only recognises contracts for foreign workers written in Arabic. Where bilingual contracts are available, the Arabic language one is authoritative. The contracts, which must contain the terms of employment, are held in duplicate, one for the sponsor and one for the worker.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> Wages for foreign workers vary, depending on the position,<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> although in general Saudis holding similar positions earn more.<ref name="Cordesman"/>

{{See also|Demographics of Saudi Arabia}}
The 2010 edition of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s ''[[World Factbook]]'' estimated that non-nationals represented 5,576,076 out of a population of 25,731,776 in Saudi Arabia.<ref name="CIA World Factbook">{{CIA World Factbook link|sa|Saudi Arabia}}</ref> However, official 2010 census figures stated that there were 8,429,401 expatriates out of a total population of 27,136,977 or roughly 31 per cent of the total.<ref>"Saudi Gazette: Nov. 24, 2010&nbsp;<U+2013> Census shows Kingdom<U+2019>s population at more than 27 million" [http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentID=2010112487888&archiveissuedate=24/11/2010]</ref> In 2007, the United Nations broke down the country's foreign population as follows: Indian: 1.3&nbsp;million, Pakistani:&nbsp;900,000, Egyptian:&nbsp;900,000, Yemeni: 800,000,&nbsp;Bangladeshi:&nbsp;500,000, Filipino:&nbsp;500,000, [[Jordan]]ian/Palestinian:&nbsp;260,000, Indonesian:&nbsp;250,000, Sri Lankan:&nbsp;350,000, [[Sudanese]]:&nbsp;250,000, [[Syria]]n:&nbsp;100,000 and [[Turks in Saudi Arabia|Turkish]]:&nbsp;100,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/EGM_Ittmig_Arab/P02_Kapiszewski.pdf |title=Arab versus Asian migrant workers in the GCC countries |format=PDF|page=10 |accessdate =1 May 2010}}</ref> In 2007 there were around 100,000&nbsp;Westerners in Saudi Arabia.<ref name= Bowen6>{{cite book |title=The History of Saudi Arabia |last=Bowen |first=Wayne H. |year=2007 |isbn=978-0313340123 |page=6}}</ref>

The results of the 2004&nbsp;census indicates that only about 15&nbsp;per cent of foreign workers are in the skilled category, with the remainder mostly working in agriculture, cleaning and domestic service.<ref>{{cite book |title=National Security in Saudi Arabia: Threats, Responses, and Challenges |last=Cordesman |first=Anthony H.  |coauthors=Corobaid, Nawaf  |year=2005 |isbn=978-0275988111 |page=374}}</ref> Country of origin has been an important factor in determining foreign workers' occupational roles in Saudi Arabia.

===Skilled workers===
Most specialized technical workers are [[United States|American]] or European,<ref>{{cite book |title=Middle East: Region in Transition, Saudi Arabia and Yemen |last=Etheredge |first=Laura S. |year=2011 |isbn=978-1615303359 |page=8}}</ref> and are occupied particularly in the defence and petrochemical industries.<ref name= Bowen6/> Westerners generally feel that they are paid well and have excellent living conditions and housing with schooling paid for by their employers.<ref name= Zuhur212>{{cite book |title=Middle East in Focus: Saudi Arabia |last=Zuhur |first=Sherifa |year=2011 |isbn=978-1598845716 |page=212}}</ref> They often live in [[compound (enclosure)|compounds]] or [[gated community|gated communities]],<ref name= Bowen6/> such as the [[Saudi Aramco]] compound at [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran|Dhahran Camp]]. However, many Westerners left the country in 2003 and 2004 following the [[Terrorism in Saudi Arabia|terrorist attacks]] in [[Riyadh compound bombings|Riyadh]], [[Khobar Towers bombing|Khobar]] and [[2004 Yanbu attack|Yanbu]].<ref name= Zuhur212/>

Additionally Egyptians have long migrated to Saudi Arabia to take up professional jobs such as doctors, nurses, teachers and engineers, as have Filipinos to work in the health, oil and manufacturing sectors.<ref name= Zuhur211>{{cite book |title=Middle East in Focus: Saudi Arabia |last=Zuhur |first=Sherifa |year=2011 |isbn=978-1598845716 |page=211}}</ref>

===Migrant workers===
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', {{as of|2013|lc=yes}} there are more than half a million [[Migrant domestic workers|foreign-born domestic workers]] in Saudi Arabia. Most have backgrounds in poverty and come from Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.<ref name="the guardian1">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013| title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan maid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |work=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> To go to work in Saudi Arabia, they must often pay large sums to recruitment agencies in their home countries. The agencies then handle the necessary legal paperwork.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> Some falsify their dates of birth, allowing them easier access to the country.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> These workers can bring much-needed capital to their home countries, sometimes in the billions of dollars.<ref name="the guardian1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2261655/Scores-maids-facing-death-penalty-Saudi-Arabia-crimes-child-murder-killing-employers.html |date=13 January 2013| title=The maids on Saudi Arabia's death row: Scores of foreign women facing execution for child abuse, witchcraft... and killing would-be rapists |last=Gore |first=Alex |work=The Daily Mail |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

==Abuse and scandals==
{{See also|Human rights in Saudi Arabia|Women's rights in Saudi Arabia}}
Many domestic servants in Saudi Arabia are treated adequately,<ref name="humanrightswatch1">{{cite web|author=Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=printdoc&amp;docid=412ef32a4| title='Bad Dreams:' Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date= 14 July 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> but there have been numerous cases of abuse. Foreign workers have been raped, exploited, under- or unpaid, physically abused,<ref name="the guardian1"/> overworked and locked in their places of employment. The international organisation [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) describes these conditions as "near-slavery" and attributes them to "deeply rooted gender, religious, and racial discrimination".<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> In many cases the workers are unwilling to report their employers for fear of losing their jobs or further abuse.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> Other forms of general discrimination, such as a lack of [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|freedom of religion]] for non-Sunni Muslims, are also applicable.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/>

According to a spokesperson from HRW, Saudi Arabian law does not provide strong legal protection for migrant workers and housemaids. As such, they face "arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments" and may falsely be accused of crime.<ref name="the guardian1"/> [[Amnesty International]] reports that those charged are often unable to follow the court proceedings, as they are often unable to speak the language and are not given [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] or legal counsel.<ref name="the guardian1"/> Foreign workers have been charged with various crimes, including theft, murder and "black magic".<ref name="the guardian1"/><ref name="jakartapost1"/> After a worker is convicted and sentenced to death, in many cases the worker's home government is not notified. When the country's representatives are notified, it is often difficult for them to argue for a [[commutation of sentence]].<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/> Efforts by the Indonesian government in 2011, for example, required the victims' families to grant [[clemency]] and be given ''[[diyya]]'' ("blood money") in the millions of [[Saudi riyal|riyal]]{{efn|At September 2013 rates, this was equivalent to hundreds of thousands to millions of US dollars.}} before the Saudi government would consider the case.<ref name="jakartapost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/08/govt-tries-save-280-indonesians-death-row.html |date=8 July 2012 | title=Hundreds of Indonesians on death row |last=Sijabat|first=Ridwan Max |work=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> {{As of|January 2013}}, the majority of foreign workers held on [[death row]] in Saudi Arabia come from Indonesia.<ref name="the guardian1"/>

These conditions have sparked condemnation both inside and outside of Saudi Arabia. In 2002, [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia|Grand Mufti]] [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]] argued that Islam required employers to honour their contracts and not intimidate, blackmail or threaten their workers.<ref name="humanrightswatch1"/>
