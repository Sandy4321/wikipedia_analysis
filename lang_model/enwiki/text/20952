==Development==
[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]], the creator of the show, originally intended for Filburt to be a secondary character used to "add texture" to [[Rocko]] and [[Heffer Wolfe]]. Lawrence, also functioning as a director on the show, sculpted Filburt into a main character befriending Rocko and Heffer.<ref name="CharMuseum"/>

Murray auditioned Lawrence in a large casting call in [[Los Angeles]] and chose him as the voice actor for Filburt. Murray stated that he did not expect for Lawrence's "[[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] nasal to be so perfect for Filburt." {{sic}} <ref name="Murray">"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/murray.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref>

[[Martin Olson]], a writer, described the decision when Nickelodeon gave the "okay" for the marriage of Filburt and [[Characters in Rocko's Modern Life#Paula Hutchison|Paula Hutchison]] as one of the most memorable moments of the production. Olson said that the executives at first did not like the idea; linear character development did not exist in [[Nicktoons]]. Murray convinced the executives to allow for the marriage to occur.<ref name="Olson">"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/martin.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Martin Olson, writer for Rocko's Modern Life]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref>

== Character==
Filburt, described on the Australian website as "nerdy" and "[[neurosis|neurotic]],"<ref name="Aus2"/> bears many [[phobia]]s.<ref name="CharMuseum"/> Filburt, a former "genius," "babe magnet," and "star athlete," became ruined by a case of "unrequited love."<ref name="Aus2"/> The [[Nickelodeon South East Asia]] website states "think of [[Woody Allen]] when you think of Filburt."<ref name="SEAsiaProfile">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20041125012646/www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Rockos_modern_life/filburt.html Filburt]," ''[[Nickelodeon South East Asia]]''</ref>

His birth place is '''Kerplopitgoes Island''' (named after the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]]). On his 21st birthday, as dictated by nature, he is required to go back to the island for a period of time.<ref name="BorntoSpawn"/>

Filburt and Dr. Paula Hutchison have four children: Gilbert, Shellbert, Norbert, and Missy who all came from the same egg. Gilbert and Shellbert look exactly like Filburt while Missy is a miniature version of Hutchison. Norbert, on the other hand, has Filburt's eyes but oddly resembles Heffer, who took on the job of "egg-sitting" (literally, sitting on the egg to keep it warm) for Filburt when they realized Filburt's rear was too hard for the task. Norbert also often thinks that [[Rocko (Rocko's Modern Life)|Rocko]] is his father. Filburt holds the record number of jobs in the series: nine. These include a cashier at a grocery store (Rocko's Happy Sack), cashier at Kind-of-A-Lot-O-Comics (Power Trip), license checker at the Department O' Motor Vehicles (Skid Marks), film runner at the GooglePlex Cinemas (Popcorn Pandemonium), lounge singer (The Lounge Singer), Christmas tree salesman (Rocko's Modern Christmas), photographer (Hair Licked), cook at Stuff on a Stick (Pranksters), and a food sample carrier (Put out to Pasture). In one episode, it is shown that when between jobs, Filburt apparently supports himself by [[recycling]] an enormous collection of empty cans in his trailer at the Patch-O-Heaven Trailer Park; this prompted Rocko to comment, "So ''this'' is why he never works." According to geneal records of him, he is 44% [[Dutch people|Dutch]], 43% [[French people|French]], and 13% [[Germans|German]].

In the comic book, Filbert<!--Spell his name this way for the comic--> does not meet Hutch. Instead, in the first story in issue #7, he meets a female turtle named Cindy at a comic book convention.<!--Source is self-apparent in the paragraph-->

A running gag in the series is how multiple, mundane things give Filburt [[nausea]]. This is always followed with Filburt repetitivly saying, "I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous...". At the end of the episode "Sailing the Seven Zzz's", while in a sub, Filburt is about to say it, but Rocko and Heffer preempt and say "You're nauseous", at which point he says "Right" and [[vomits]].
