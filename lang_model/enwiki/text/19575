'''HMS ''Tirfing''''' was the third ship of the {{sclass|John Ericsson|monitor|0}} [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s built for the [[Royal Swedish Navy]] in the mid-1860s. She was designed under the supervision of the Swedish-born inventor, [[John Ericsson]], and built in Sweden. ''Tirfing'' made one foreign visit to Russia (visits to Norway did not count as foreign as that country was in a [[personal union]] with Sweden) in 1867, but remained in Swedish or Norwegian waters for the rest of her career. The ship was reconstructed between 1903 and 1905, but generally remained in reserve. She was mobilized during [[World War I]] and sold in 1922 for conversion to a [[barge]]. 

==Design and description==
The ''John Ericsson''-class [[ironclad]]s were designed to meet the need of the Swedish and Norwegian Navies for small, shallow-draft armored ships capable of defending their coastal waters. The standoff between {{USS|Monitor}} and the much larger {{ship|CSS|Virginia||6}} during the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in early 1862 roused much interest in Sweden in this [[monitor (warship)|new type of warship]] as it seemed ideal for coastal defense duties. John Ericsson, designer and builder of the ''Monitor'', had been born in Sweden, although he had become an American citizen in 1848, and offered to share his design with the Swedes. In response they sent Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly to the United States to study monitor design and construction under Ericsson. D'Ailly arrived in July 1862 and toured [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling mills]], [[Foundry|gun foundries]], and visited several different ironclads under construction. He returned to Sweden in 1863 having completed the drawings of a ''Monitor''-type ship under Ericsson's supervision.<ref>Harris, pp. 22<U+2013>24</ref> 

The ship measured {{convert|60.88|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.54|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|3.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|1522|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=g54/> ''John Ericsson'' was divided into nine main compartments by eight watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. Over time a [[flying bridge]] and, later, a full superstructure, was added to each ship between the [[gun turret]] and the funnel.<ref name=b69>Bjoerud, p. 169</ref> Initially her crew numbered 80 officers and men, but this increased to 104 as she was modified with additional weapons.<ref name=g54>Harris, p. 26</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''John Ericsson''-class ships had one twin-cylinder [[Marine_steam_engine#Vibrating_lever|vibrating lever steam engines]], designed by Ericsson himself, driving a single four-bladed, {{convert|3.74|m|ftin|sp=us|adj=on}} propeller. Their engines were powered by four [[fire-tube boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|40|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines produced a total of {{convert|380|ihp|lk=on}} which gave the monitors a maximum speed of {{convert|6.5|kn|lk=on}} in calm waters. The ships carried {{convert|110|t|LT|}} of coal, enough for six day's steaming.<ref>Harris, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>

===Armament===
''Tirfing'', and her [[sister ship]] ''Thord<U+00F6>n'', were briefly armed with a pair of {{convert|267|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} M/66 [[smoothbore]] guns<ref name=h27>Harris, p. 27</ref> before being rearmed in 1873 with two {{convert|240|mm|in|sp=us|1|adj=on}} M/69 [[rifled breech loader]]s, derived from a French design. They weighed {{convert|14670|kg|sp=us}} and fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|397|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. At their maximum elevation of 7.5<U+00B0> they had a range of {{convert|3500|m|yd|sp=us}}. An improved version was developed in the 1870s; the guns were heavier, {{convert|16688|kg|sp=us}}, but had a higher muzzle velocity of {{convert|413|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. Coupled with the increased elevation of 11.29<U+00B0>, this gave them a range of {{convert|5000|m|yd|sp=us}}. ''Tirfing'' received her guns in 1885.<ref>Bojerud, pp. 169, 177</ref>

In 1877 each monitor received a pair of 10-barreled {{convert|12.17|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} M/75 [[machine gun]]s designed by [[Helge Palmcrantz]]. Each machine gun weighed {{convert|115|kg|sp=us}} and had a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute. Its projectiles had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|386|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} and a maximum range of {{convert|900|m|yd|sp=us}}. These guns were replaced during the 1880s by the 4-barreled {{convert|25.4|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} M/77 [[1-inch Nordenfelt gun|Nordenfeldt gun]], which was an enlarged version of Palmcrantz's original design. The {{convert|203|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} gun had a rate of fire of 120 rounds per minute and each round had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|490|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. Its maximum range was {{convert|1600|m|sp=us|yd}}.<ref>Bojerud, pp. 177<U+2013>78</ref>

===Armor===
The ''John Ericsson''-class ships had a complete waterline armor [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|1.8|m|ftin|sp=us}} high and {{convert|124|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick. The armor consisted of five plates backed by {{convert|91|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of wood. The lower edge of this belt was {{convert|74.2|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick as it was only three plates thick. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was {{convert|24.7|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in two layers. The [[gun turret]]'s armor consisted of twelve layers of iron, totalling {{convert|270|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in thickness on the first four monitors. The inside of the turret was lined with mattresses to catch splinters.<ref name=b69/> The base of the turret was protected with a {{convert|127|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[glacis]], {{convert|520|mm|in|1|sp=us}} high, and the turret's roof was 127&nbsp;millimeters thick.  The [[conning tower]] was positioned on top of the turret and its sides were ten layers ({{convert|250|mm|in|1|sp=us}}) thick. The funnel was protected by six layers of armor with a total thickness of {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} up to half its height.<ref name=g54/><ref name=b69/>

==Service==
''Tirfing'' had her [[keel]] laid down on 28 January 1865 and was launched 1 June 1866. She was commissioned on 2 July 1867. That same month [[Oscar II of Sweden|Crown Prince Oscar]], later King Oscar II, inspected ''Tirfing'', {{HMS|John Ericsson||2}}, {{HMS|Thord<U+00F6>n||2}}, the steam [[frigate]]s ''Thor'' and {{HMS|Vanadis|1862|2}}, and the Norwegian monitor {{ship|HNoMS|Skorpionen||2}} in the [[Stockholm archipelago]] before they departed for port visits in Helsingfors, later known as [[Helsinki]], and [[Kronstadt]] in August, where they were visited by [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia]], head of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. This was the only foreign visit ever made by the ship.<ref name=h28>Harris, p. 28</ref>

''Tirfing'' was commissioned less often than her two older sisters. She was only active in 1867, 1873, 1880, 1885 and 1888<U+2013>89 before she was mobilized for World War I. The ship was reconstructed in 1903<U+2013>05; she received a pair of new {{convert|120|mm|adj=on|1|sp=us}} [[Bofors]] M/94 guns that were given elevation limits of <U+2212>7<U+00B0> and +15<U+00B0>. The ship also received new boilers and eight {{convert|47|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} M/95 quick-firing guns taken from the {{sclass|Komet|torpedo boat|5}} and {{sclass|Stierna|torpedo boat}}s. ''Tirfing'' joined her sister ''Thord<U+00F6>n'' as part of the [[G<U+00F6>teborg]] flotilla during World War I. Both ships were decommissioned in 1922 and sold the following year. Their new owner converted them into [[barge]]s and used them in [[Stockholm]] harbor.<ref>Bojerud, pp. 177<U+2013>78, 180</ref>
