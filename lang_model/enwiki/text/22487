==Tishrei in Jewish history==
'''1 Tishrei''' - [[Adam_and_eve|Adam & Eve]] were created (3761 BCE)<br />
*<small>On Tishrei 1, which coresponds to the sixth day of creation -- "God said: 'Let us make Man in Our image, after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth...'" ([[Genesis]] 1:26).</small><br />
'''1 Tishrei''' - (3761 BCE) - First [[Sin]] & [[Repentance]]<br />
*<small>On the same day man was created, man also committed the first sin of history, transgressing the divine commandment not to eat from the "[[Tree of Knowledge|Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]." Adam and Eve were banished from the [[Garden of Eden]], and humanity became subject to death, labor and moral confusion. But also on that day, the first persons also [[repented]] their sin, introducing the concept and opportunities of [[teshuvah]] ("return").</small><br />
'''1 Tishrei''' - (2105 BCE) - [[dove|Dove]]'s 3rd Mission<br />
*<small>On the 1st of Tishrei, (the 307th day of the Great Flood), [[Noah]] dispatched a dove from the [[Noah's Ark|ark]], for the third time. When the dove did not return, this is how Noah knew that the flood was drained from the earth. On that day, Noah removed the roof of the ark; but Noah and his family, and all the animals, remained in the ark for another 57 days, until the 27th of Cheshvan, when the suface of the earth was completely dry and God commanded them to leave the ark and resettle and repopulate the earth.</small><br />
'''1 Tishrei''' - (1677 BCE) - Binding of [[Isaac]]; [[Sarah]]'s Death<br />
*<small>[[Abraham]]'s test of faith -- his binding of [[Isaac]] in preparation to [[sacrifice]] him as per God's command, occurred on the 1st of Tishrei of the Hebrew year 2084 (1677 BCE), and is recalled each [[Rosh Hashanah]] with the sounding of the [[shofar]] ([[ram]]'s horn, for the reason that a ram was sacrificed in Isaac's place when an [[angel]] revealed that the command to sacrifice [[Isaac]] was a divine test). The [[Torah]]'s account of the event is publicly read in the [[synagogue]] on the 2nd day of Rosh Hashanah. On the day of Isaac's binding, the [[Talmud]] tells that his mother, [[Sarah]], died at age 127, and was then buried in the [[Machpelah Cave]] in [[Hebron]].</small><br />

'''3 Tishrei''' - Assassination of [[Gedaliah]]  (''[[Fast of Gedalia]]'')<br />
*<small>3rd Tishrei is a fast day which mourns the assassination of the Jewish Royal [[Gedaliah ben Achikam]], governor of the Land of [[Israel]] for a short period following the destruction of the [[First Temple]]. Gedaliah's killing spelled the end of the small remnant of the [[Jewish]] community that remained in Israel after its destruction, which then subsuqently fled to [[Egypt]]. (According to many opinions, the assassination actually occurred on [[Rosh Hashanah]], but the commemoration of the event is postponed to the day after the festival).</small><br />

*<small>The great Talmudic sage, Rabbi Akiva, was taken captive by the Romans on the 5th of Tishrei, of the year 3894 from creation (134 CE). His subsequent torture and execution ("martyred") is recalled in the [[Martyrology (Judaism)|Eleh Ezkerah]] poem of the [[Yom Kippur]] service.</small><br />

*<small>The 14-day dedication festivities, which celebrated the completion of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem built by [[King Solomon]], started on the 8th of Tishrei of the Hebrew year, 2935 (826 BCE). The [[First Temple]] served as the centre of Jewish national and spiritual life for 410 years, until it was destroyed by the [[Babylonians]] in 423 BCE.</small><br />
