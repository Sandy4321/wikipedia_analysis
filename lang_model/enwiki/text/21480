'''Thatgamecompany''', stylized as '''thatgamecompany''', is an [[United States|American]] [[Independent business|independent]] [[video game developer]] co-founded by [[University of Southern California]] students [[Kellee Santiago]] and [[Jenova Chen]]. The studio is currently a second-party developer for [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], and is under contract to create three downloadable games for the [[PlayStation 3]]'s [[PlayStation Network]] service. The first of these games is a remake of Chen's award-winning [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] title ''[[Flow (video game)|Flow]]'', with enhanced visuals and sound, added [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer modes]] and compatibility with the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller. The title was released on the [[PlayStation Store]] in 2007. The company's second PlayStation 3 game, ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'', was released on the PlayStation Store in 2009. As of May 2011, Thatgamecompany employs twelve people.

The company focuses on creating video games that provoke emotional responses from players. Its employees have stated that, while they are not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what they want the player to feel, rather than by establishing [[game mechanics]]. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.

==History==
In the fall of 2005, [[Jenova Chen]] and [[Kellee Santiago]] began thinking about creating their own video game company. The two were in their final year as master's students in the [[USC Interactive Media Division|Interactive Media Program]] at the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts]], and had just released a video game<U+2014>''[[Cloud (video game)|Cloud]]''<U+2014>that they had developed with several other students.<ref name="GIsantint"/> The group intended the project as an experiment, meant to reveal whether they could create a game that "expressed something different than video games had in the past", and to determine the public's level of interest in video games of that nature.<ref name="TEDint"/> Due to the game's strongly positive reception, Santiago and Chen began to consider founding their own company, so that they could continue making games like ''Cloud''<U+2014>in which the design is not based on [[game mechanics|gameplay mechanics]], but on inspiring emotions in players<U+2014>after they left college.<ref name="GIsantint"/> 

At the time, [[Online distribution|digital distribution]] was gaining popularity. The two saw it as an opportunity to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies.<ref name="GIsantint"/> Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees.<ref name="TGCstart"/><ref name="NPRint"/> The company soon signed a deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], which had been impressed by Chen's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game ''[[Flow (video game)|Flow]]''<U+2014>a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming [[PlayStation Network]] distribution system, and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.<ref name="WSJedito2"/>

Initially, Thatgamecompany consisted of Chen, Santiago, John Edwards, and Nick Clarke, the last of whom had collaborated with Chen on ''Flow''. Santiago was the president of the company and the [[video game producer|producer]] for its games, while Chen was the [[Game design#Game designer|lead designer]], Edwards the [[game programmer|lead engineer]], and Clarke another designer.<ref name="TGCflowstaff"/> Although they considered adapting ''Cloud'' as their first product for Sony, they instead decided on ''Flow'', as it was "more fleshed-out as a design". They felt that it would be easier than ''Cloud'' to develop while they built the company; no members of the team had experience with managing a business or with creating a commercial game.<ref name="GIsantint"/> During development, Chen briefly worked for [[Maxis]] on the game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. Several contract workers assisted Thatgamecompany with ''Flow''{{'}}s development, including Austin Wintory, the game's composer.<ref name="TGCflowstaff"/><ref name="WSJedito2"/> 

The company originally believed that the PlayStation 3 version of ''Flow'' could be completed in four months, and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the [[PlayStation Network]]. However, when it was finally released in February 2007, it did not include "half of the original design".<ref name="GSchenint"/> According to Santiago, the Sony producer assigned to the team had anticipated that they would under-estimate the game's development length, and was not surprised by the delay.<ref name="GIsantint"/> The game was well received; it became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) awards.<ref name="VARIETYpiece"/><ref name="AIASflowaward"/><ref name="BAFTAflowaward"/> After its release, an expansion pack and a [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game were created by [[SuperVillain Studios]]. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond ensuring that they retained the same [[game design|design]] and [[game art design|art direction]] as the original, as they were busy creating their next title, ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]''.<ref name="GSchenint"/>

''Flower'' was Thatgamecompany's "first game outside the safety net of academia," according to Santiago.<ref name="GAMAflowerdevint"/> Six to nine people were involved at different stages of development, and Chen remained with the studio for the entire project.<ref name="GAMAflowerdevint2"/> The game's music was composed by Vincent Diamante, who had worked with Chen and Santiago on ''Cloud''.<ref name="GAMAflowermusic"/> The game was developed for two years, but the team spent three-fourths of that time in the prototyping stage. After they decided on the game's elements, ''Flower'' was produced in only six months.<ref name="GSsantint"/> Like ''Flow'', the game was well received when it was released in February 2009, selling in the top ten PlayStation Network titles of the year and garnering several awards.<ref name="GSsantint"/><ref name="BAFTAflower"/> After the release of ''Flower'', Thatgamecompany moved into their own building in Los Angeles.<ref name="GSsantint"/>

The company's current project is ''[[Journey (2011 video game)|Journey]]'', which is slated for release in 2011. It is the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony, and is being developed by a team of twelve.<ref name="TGCjourneystaff"/> This team does not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by [[Robin Hunicke]].<ref name="GSint1"/>

==Philosophy==
When Thatgamecompany designs a game, they begin by deciding on the emotions and feelings they wish to invoke in the player. This differs from the approach of most developers, who build from game mechanics or genre features. According to Santiago, the company creates emotional responses to demonstrate the wide range of possible experiences in video games, which she believes is larger than the few<U+2014>excitement and fear, for example<U+2014>that are typically presented.<ref name="CBCsantint"/> Chen has said that the company's games are meant to evoke emotions more than a message; he specifically changed the design of ''Flower'' when early testers felt that the game promoted green energy. Chen believes that he is "too young" to make a game with a strong message, and so designs the company's products to avoid overt meanings.<ref name="GINFint"/> Santiago has said that Thatgamecompany's goal is "to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium, and to create games that appeal to a wide variety of people". She hopes to change the video game industry with this process, so that other companies approach video games as a "creative medium" instead of a mass product.<ref name="ISint"/>

Thatgamecompany's employees are not opposed to making action titles, and, as a break from their regular projects, have internally created "exciting" games that were well received by Sony. However, Chen believes that there is no reason for the company to commercially produce such games, as they would not be creating new ideas that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio, as opposed to working for existing game developers.<ref name="GSchenint"/> Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make "big budget blockbuster games", as he believes that the financial pressure would stifle innovation.<ref name="GIint"/>

==Games==
{{main|Flow (video game)|l1=Flow}}
In ''Flow'', the player navigates a series of [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] planes with an aquatic [[microorganism]] that evolves by consuming other microorganisms.<ref name="EGreview"/> The game's design is based on Chen's research into [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|dynamic difficulty adjustment]] at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s theoretical concept of mental immersion or [[flow (psychology)|flow]].<ref name="JSint"/><ref name="WSJedito"/> It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007.<ref name="Flowreleasedate"/>

{{main|Flower (video game)|l1=Flower}}
''Flower'' was intended as a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Flow''. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower [[petal]] through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.<ref name="GPreview"/> It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.<ref name="Flowerreleasedate"/>

{{main|Journey (2011 video game)|l1=Journey}}
''Journey'' is an upcoming video game. Interviews and previews have indicated that the player will control a robed figure who wakes up in a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as the destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate, but may help each other or not as they wish.<ref name="CBCsantint"/> The game is expected to be released for the PlayStation 3 in 2011.<ref name="Journeyreleasedate"/>
