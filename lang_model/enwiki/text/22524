'''Rebiya Kadeer''' (born  21 January 1947) is a prominent [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] businesswoman and political activist from the northwest region of [[Xinjiang]] in the People's Republic of China (PRC). She has been the president of the [[World Uyghur Congress]] since November 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uyghurcongress.org/En/AboutWUC.asp?mid=1095738888&mid2=-696970330 |work=Uyghurcongress.org |title=Leadership of the World Uyghur Congress | accessdate=10 July 2005}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Kadeer has been active in defending the rights of the largely Muslim Uyghur minority, who she says has been subject to systematic oppression by the Chinese government.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/08/20/seven_questions_with_rebiya_kadeer}|title= Foreign Policy: Seven questions with Rebiya Kadeer|date=August 2009}}</ref>
Kadeer is currently living in exile in the United States.

==Early life and career==
Rebiya Kadeer was born into poverty in the city of [[Altay, Xinjiang]]. She married in 1965 and moved to the city of [[Aksu, Xinjiang]]. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], she was purged as a [[class enemy]] after a clothing business which she ran with her husband was branded as "speculation", resulting in her divorce.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Following her divorce, Kadeer opened a laundromat in 1976. She later remarried in 1981 to [[Sidik Rouzi]], then an associate professor, and moved to [[<U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi]]. In <U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi, Kadeer leased a market in the local business district, converting it into a department store that specialized in [[Uyghur culture|Uyghur]] ethnic costumes. In 1985, Kadeer converted the site again to a 14,000 square meter commercial building.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Kadeer engaged in cross-border trade, accumulating assets which at their peak were worth more than 200&nbsp;million yuan.<ref name=profile050317/> She became one of the five richest people in China, and her success earned her the nickname "the millionairess". The trading company she established had businesses operating in China, Russia  and [[Kazakhstan]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} She has given birth to eleven children.<ref name=feer200907>{{cite web |url=http://www.feer.com/free-interviews/2009/july54/Taking-a-Stand-for-Chinas-Uighurs |title=Taking a Stand for China<U+2019>s Uighurs
|first=Paulette |last=Chu Miniter |work=[[Far Eastern Economic Review]] |issue=54 |date=March 2007}}</ref> The Akida Industry and Trade Co founded by Kadeer, owns a number of properties in Xinjiang. These include The Akida Trade Center, the adjacent Kadeer Trade Center and the Tuanjie, or Unity, theatre in <U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi.<ref name=reut20090908>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP473138 China to demolish Kadeer buildings in restive Urumqi |first=Royston |last=Chan |date=8 September 2009 |work=Reuters}}</ref>

Kadeer was an active [[philanthropist]] within the community, most notably through her foundation, [[1,000 Families Mothers Project]], a charity intended to help Uyghur women start their own local businesses.<ref name=profile050317>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4357607.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Profile: Rebiya Kadeer |date=17 March 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> In 1993, Kadeer was appointed delegate to the eighth session of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]],<ref name=profile050317/> the [[National People's Congress]] and was a representative to the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|UN Fourth World Conference for Women]] in Beijing in 1995.<ref>[http://www.rfa.org/english/uyghur/uyghur_kadeer-20050317.html China Frees Rebiya Kadeer]. [[Radio Free Asia]].  17 March 2005.</ref> Kadeer has also been vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce, and vice chairwoman of the Xinjiang Association of Women Entrepreneurs.

In 1997, Kadeer established the "Thousand Mothers Movement", to promote job training for Uyghur women, as well as evening schools for Uyghurs who did not have chance to go to ordinary school.<ref>[http://www.ifex.org/china/2005/02/09/jailed_uighur_dissident_wins_norwegian/ Jailed Uighur Dissident Wins Norwegian Human Rights Award]. [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]].  9 February 2005.</ref>

==Imprisonment==
Having been a witness to the [[Ghulja Incident]] in 1997, Kadeer says she failed in her repeated attempts to persuade Beijing that change was needed. Feeling that she had no choice, she openly criticised the government in a speech before parliament, and was promptly removed from the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|National People's Consultative Conference]]; authorities revoked her passport.<ref name=feer200907/> In 1999 she sent newspaper clippings to her exiled husband, Sidik Rouzi, who was living in the United States and who is active in protesting against Chinese policies towards the [[Uyghur people]]. Kadeer was detained in August 1999 while on her way to meet a US [[Congressional Research Service]] delegation investigating the situation in Xinjiang at the time,<ref name=feer200907/> and was alleged to be in possession of a list of 10 people "suspected of having a connection with national separatist activities". She was detained by PRC authorities on charges of "leaking state secrets", and was convicted on 10 March 2000 in the <U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi Intermediate People's Court, of "endangering state security",<ref name=profile050317/><ref>Millward (2007), p. 360.</ref> after sending her husband newspaper clippings on the treatment of the Uyghur community.<ref>McGeown, Kate ( 24 June 2005). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4618995.stm Fighting the cause of China's Uighurs]. [[BBC News]].</ref>

Whilst in prison, Kadeer spent two years in [[solitary confinement]], but was not tortured.  She speculates that this was because guards were aware of her international reputation.<ref name=feer200907/> In 2004, her sentence was reduced by a year based on citations of good behaviour where she was being held.

==Release and exile==
In 2004 she won the [[Rafto Prize]] for [[human rights]].<ref>Esposito; Voll; Bakar (2007), p. 208.</ref> On 14 March 2005, Kadeer was released early, nominally [[Medical parole|on medical grounds]], into United States' custody in advance of a visit by [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] to the region. The U.S., which had pressured for her release, agreed to drop a resolution against China in the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] moderated their criticism somewhat as a consequence.<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engasa170102005 News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty International]. Amnesty International.</ref> On 17 March, Kadeer flew to the U.S. and joined her family in Washington, D.C. In an interview with [[Phoenix Television]] before her departure to the US, she stated that she would remain a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and as a person born in the new China, she would sacrifice her own life for the integrity of China.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j0cVRnKtXk Uyghur Rebiya Kadeer on China]. [[Youtube]].</ref>

In April 2007, one of her sons, Ablikim, was sentenced to 9 years in prison and 3 years deprivation of political rights, reportedly after confessing to charges of "instigating and engaging in secessionist activities." In November 2006 Alim, another of her sons, was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined $62,500. Qahar Abdurehim, yet another of her sons, was fined $12,500 for tax evasion but not jailed. In June 2006, Alim, Ablikim, and Qahar were officially charged with state security and economic crimes shortly following Kadeer' election as president of the Uighur American Association.<ref name=USstate>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90133.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007], [[US Department of State]], 14 September 2007, accessed 28 Sept 2007</ref>

The Chinese government characterizes Kadeer as "an ironclad separatist colluding with terrorists and Islamic extremists."<ref name="csm">{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2009/0709/p06s15-woap.html|title=Spiritual mother of Uighurs or terrorist?|first=Peter|last=Ford|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref> But Kadeer believes that all Uyghur organizations fight peacefully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/simp/hi/newsid_6250000/newsid_6250100/6250105.stm |title=<U+70ED><U+6BD4><U+5A05>:<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+7A81><U+88AD><U+4E1C><U+7A81><U+8425><U+5730><U+4EE4><U+4EBA><U+6000><U+7591> |publisher=BBC News|language=Chinese | date=10 January 2007 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> On 5 June 2007, at a conference on democracy and security held in [[Prague]], Kadeer met privately with President [[George W.

While the protests that preceded [[July 2009 <U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi riots|the July 2009 riots]] were ostensibly a response to the death of two Uighur workers in Guangdong, the Chinese government catapulted Kadeer into the limelight when it claimed the WUC, which she heads, had planned the riots.<ref name=Xinhua>{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/06/content_11658819.htm | title=Civilians and armed police officer killed in NW China violence |publisher=Xinhua News | date=5 July 2009 | accessdate=5 July 2009 }}</ref>
That said, Taiwan denied a visa to Mrs. Kadeer in Sept 2009, alleging she had links to the [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]], classed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations and USA.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2009/09/26/226198/Uighur-activist.htm|title=Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer denied entry visa to Taiwan|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=18 August 2010|publisher=[[The China Post]]}}</ref>

Kadeer has denied that the riots were organised.<ref name=nyt090705>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/world/asia/06china.html?ref=global-home | title=Riots in Western China Amid Ethnic Tension  |work=The New York Times  | date=5 July 2009 | accessdate=5 July 2009 | last=Wong| first=Edward}}</ref>

On 3 August, ''Xinhua'' reported that two of Rebiya Kadeer's children had written letters blaming her for orchestrating the riots. According to ''Xinhua'', they pleaded: "We want a stable and safe life <U+2026> Please think about the happiness of us and your grandchildren. Don't destroy our happy life here. Don't follow the provocation from some people in other countries."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/03/xinjiang-kadeer-uighur-urumqi | title =China says Uighur leader's family condemn her |work=The Guardian | date= 3 August 2009 | accessdate = 3 August 2009 | location=London | first=Tania | last=Branigan}}</ref> Germany-based spokesman for the WUC rejected the letters as fakes. A [[Human Rights Watch]] researcher remarked their style was "suspiciously close" to the way the Chinese authorities had described rioting in Xinjiang and the aftermath. He added that: "...it's highly irregular for [her children] to be placed on the platform of a government mouthpiece ... for wide dispersion."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.ph.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3507887 | title =Uighur leader's family 'blame her' for unrest: report |publisher=MSN |author=AFP |date= 3 August 2009 | accessdate = 3 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[China Central Television|CCTV]] broadcast a video of interviews with the family members of Kadeer on 4 August.<ref>{{cite news |title=Family hopes Kadeer will listen to their appeals |date=4 August 2009 |url=http://www.cctv.com/program/cctvnews/20090804/106651.shtml |work=China Central Television}}</ref>

''Xinhua'' announced in early September 2009 that three properties owned by Kadeer's companies, including the Akida Trade Center, where more than 30 members of Kadeer's family were reportedly living, would be torn down due to "cracks in the walls and sunken footings".<ref name=reut20090908/> Local Uighurs said they saw this as an attempt to banish Kadeer's shadow; the Uighur American Association said the demolition  may spark a new round of violence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hiSHpMNghwq0moBHzVc7izvvK93g |title=Kadeer buildings loom as next Xinjiang flashpoint |first= Dan |last=Martin |work=AFP |date=7 September 2009}}</ref>

===''The 10 Conditions of Love''===
Director Jeff Daniels shot a documentary film in 2009 about Kadeer, called "The 10 Conditions of Love". It was destined to be screened at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]]. The organisers refused a request from Chinese consulate in Melbourne for the film to be withdrawn and for Kadeer's invitation to the festival to be rescinded. Several Chinese directors pulled out of the event. The festival website was [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] and festival information replaced with the Chinese flag and anti-Kadeer slogans, and booked out all film sessions on the site; a [[denial-of-service attack]] forced it to shut down.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25866348-29277,00.html Hack attack hits Melbourne Film Festival] - News.com.au</ref><ref>[http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,,25840613-5014239,00.html Hackers attack Melbourne Film Festival website] - News.com.au</ref> Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China was "firmly opposed to any foreign country providing her with a stage for her anti-China separatist activities". However, Daniels said it was good that "people were able to see different sides of the story" and criticised the heavy pressure from the Chinese government.<ref>McGuirk, Rod (26 July 2009).

Australian Federal Labor Member of Parliament, Michael Danby, transmitted a message of support for the screening from [[14th Dalai Lama]], saying: "...[Kadeer] is another one of the national leaders who is a paradigm of non-violence." Danby said the Dalai Lama, "wanted to make it very clear to people that the claims of this woman being a violent person or instigating violence, is from his point of view, and with all of his authority, wrong."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/09/2650267.htm?section=justin Dalai Lama sends message of support to Kadeer].

*Oxford University interviewed Kadeer, available in iTunes. The release date strangely appears "6/23/18". The author is listed as "Rebiya Kadeer (Rabiya Kadeer)," with "Oxford University" as the provider. The description reads "Rebiya Kadeer (Rabiya Kadeer), Washington DC, USA. Left Xinjiang in 2005 for Washington DC and now is the president of the World Uyghur Congress, the most significant Uighur leader, either in China or abroad, and a hate figure for the Chinese government".
