'''Joseph McMinn''' (June 22, 1758{{spaced ndash}}October 17, 1824) was the fifth [[Governor of Tennessee]], serving from 1815 to 1821.  A veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], he had previously served in the legislature of the [[Southwest Territory]] (1794&ndash;1796), and later as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate (1805&ndash;1811).  Following his term as governor, he served as an agent to the [[Cherokee]] for the United States government.<ref name=tehc>John Thweatt, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=876 Joseph McMinn]," ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2010.  Retrieved: 18 September 2012.</ref>  

==Life and political career==
McMinn was born to Quaker parents in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], one of 10 children.<ref name=langsdon>Phillip Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'' (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 49-59.</ref>  He obtained only a limited rural education, and even in his later years would be described as a "rustic frontiersman."<ref name=langsdon />  Though a Quaker, he joined the Continental Army during the American Revolution.<ref name=tehc />

In 1786, McMinn moved to [[Hawkins County, Tennessee]], where he had purchased a farm.  In 1792, [[Southwest Territory]] governor [[William Blount]] appointed McMinn justice of the peace for Hawkins County,<ref name=tngenweb>''[http://tngenweb.org/mcminn/JosephMcMinn.htm Daily Post Athenian: Bicentennial Edition, 1976 1B]'', transcribed by Bill Bigham at TNGenWeb.org.  Retrieved: 19 September 2012.</ref> and McMinn represented Hawkins County in the territorial legislature from 1794 to 1796.<ref name=tehc />  He also served as an officer in the territorial militia, eventually rising to the rank of brigade commander.<ref name=tngenweb />

McMinn was a delegate to the 1796 [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] and helped write the state constitution that came into effect when Tennessee was admitted to the Union effective June 1, 1796.<ref name=tehc />  He was chosen to deliver a copy of the completed document to the federal government in Philadelphia.<ref name=langsdon />  He served in the [[Tennessee Senate]] from 1797 to 1801, and from 1803 to 1811, and was Speaker of the Senate from 1805 to 1811.<ref name=speakers /><ref name=tngenweb />    

In 1815, McMinn ran for governor against four other prominent state politicians: Senator [[Jesse Wharton]], Congressman [[Robert Weakley]], former speaker of the state house Robert Foster, and fellow state constitutional convention delegate Thomas Henderson.  Though his opponents assailed him in the press, McMinn won the election with a plurality of over 15,000 of the 37,000 votes cast.  He was reelected in 1817, again defeating Foster, and elected to a third term in 1819, defeating Enoch Parsons.<ref name=langsdon />  

While governor, he concentrated on peaceful relationships with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in order to ease the way for more [[whites|white]] settlement, particularly to the west.  The Chickasaw Purchase Treaty, or Western Purchase, in which most of what is now [[West Tennessee]] was acquired, was accomplished during his tenure as governor.  Fourteen new [[county (US)|counties]] were created.<ref name=tehc />  The Calhoun Treaty (or Hiwassee Purchase), in which the United States acquired a portion of southeastern Tennessee, was also negotiated during his tenure.<ref name=folmsbee>Stanley Folmsbee, ''Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796<U+2013>1845'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 27-33.</ref>    

Following the [[Panic of 1819]], McMinn called a joint session of the state legislature in June 1820, which voted to establish a state bank that would provide low-interest loans.  This agitated many of McMinn's fellow East Tennesseans, who had for years been complaining about lack of state appropriations for internal improvements, namely navigational improvements on the upper [[Tennessee River]].  The legislature used state-owned lands from the Hiwassee Purchase to provide financial backing for the new bank.<ref name=folmsbee /> 

Upon his retirement as governor due to the [[term limit]]s in the 1796 constitution that he had helped to draft, he returned to his farm in Hawkins County.  In 1823, he moved to a farm along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Calhoun, Tennessee]], and served an agent for federal government at the nearby Cherokee Agency until the time of his death.<ref name=tehc />

==Family and legacy==

McMinn married his first wife, Anna Cooper, in 1785, and they had one daughter, Jane.  Following the death of his first wife, McMinn married Rebecca Kincade.  She died in January 1815, and his only child, Jane, died two weeks later.  In 1816, he married Nancy Glasgow Williams, the daughter of disgraced North Carolina Secretary of State [[James Glasgow]].  This marriage ended in a controversial separation and a failed attempt at divorce in 1821.<ref name=langsdon /><ref name=biblerecords>Jeannette Tillotson Acklen, ''Tennessee Records, Bible Records and Marriage Bonds'' (Nashville: 1933).

McMinn joined the Presbyterian Church late in life, and was buried in an unmarked grave at the Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery in Calhoun.  In 1880, his namesake [[McMinn County, Tennessee|McMinn County]] attempted to have his grave reinterred in its county seat of [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]], but an eccentric preacher named R.J.M. Only, who was the only person who knew the grave's location, refused to reveal it.  After the county agreed not to move the grave, Only revealed the location, and large marker was placed upon it.<ref> C. Stephen Byrum, ''McMinn County'' (Memphis, Tenn: Memphis State University Press, 1984), pp. 14-15.</ref>  

In 1942, a portrait of McMinn that had been painted by noted artist [[Rembrandt Peale]] in 1796 was discovered in Philadelphia.  McMinn apparently posed for the portrait during his visit to the city to deliver the newly-written Tennessee state constitution to the federal government.  The Tennessee Historical Society purchased the painting for the state.<ref name=tsla />

Along with McMinn County, the town of [[McMinnville, Tennessee]], in [[Warren County, Tennessee|Warren County]], is named in Joseph McMinn's honor.<ref name=tehc />
