==Plot==
===The Thing and I===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of characters in The Simpsons]] -->
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] begin to hear strange noises and think that there is something in the [[attic]].  Homer claims not to know what they are talking about, although he is later seen grabbing a bucket of fish heads and heading into the attic. Bart and Lisa investigate and find out that there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic and discover that "it" escaped. Marge immediately calls [[Dr. Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]] and he explains that Bart had a [[conjoined twins|conjoined twin]] brother named [[Simpsons family#Hugo|Hugo]]. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so he was locked up in the attic. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he soon discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart up to the attic so that he can reattach himself. However, Dr. Hibbert finds them and knocks out Hugo, commenting that the evil twin is always on the left side. However, Hibbert realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side and that Bart was the evil twin all along. In the end, the Simpson family sits down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked up in the attic.

===The Genesis Tub===
[[Image:Lisa Genesis Tub.png|left|200px|thumb|Lisa in the tub universe.]]
Lisa performs a science experiment to see if cola will dissolve a tooth and Bart shocks Lisa as part of his project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth was also shocked and it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate, going through the various ages humans have gone through into modern times and eventually, the future. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe and the people respond, sending an army of space ships to attack Bart. Bart vows revenge on the small universe and Lisa wonders what to do. Suddenly, she is shrunk down (using the "de-bigulator") into the tub where the citizens explain that they regard her as god and they want her to do something about Bart. However, Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. She asks to be returned to her normal size, which the citizens explain is impossible (it would require a "re-bigulator", a preposterous notion), and she realizes that she's stuck in the tub for the rest of her life.  She succumbs to her fate, takes her rightful place on the throne and demands nice shoes.

===Citizen Kang===
[[Image:Homer Dole Clinton.png|left|thumb|200px|Kang and Kodos take on the form of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.]]
While fishing, Homer is abducted by the aliens [[Kang and Kodos]]. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer tells them about the then-upcoming [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|election]] and that the winner could be either [[Bill Clinton]] or [[Bob Dole]]. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in [[suspended animation]] tubes. Kang and Kodos take on their forms to ensure that one of them will become the next leader. The aliens soak Homer in [[rum]] and return him to Earth and nobody believes him. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save the real Dole and Clinton, however he accidentally [[spacing|ejects them into space]]. On the day before the election, Homer successfully reveals the candidates' real identities. Realizing it is too late to get new candidates, the crowd decides to vote for a third party candidate. However, Kang and Kodos convince the crowd that voting for a third would be a waste of a vote. Kang is elected [[President of the United States|President]], but [[crown]]s himself [[King]], and forces the citizens of America to build a giant [[ray gun]] to aim at another planet.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|id=ISBN 0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="SNPP">[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F02.html Episode Capsule] at The Simpsons Archive</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 173}}</ref>

==Production==
Normally, the writers would come up with some sort of wrap around for Treehouse of Horror episodes, but because they had been cut the [[Treehouse of Horror VI|previous year]], the writers didn't bother this year.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> "The Thing and I" was written by [[Ken Keeler]],<ref name="Keeler">{{cite video | people=Keeler, Ken|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  "The Genesis Tub" was written by [[Dan Greaney]]<ref name="Greaney">{{cite video | people=Greaney, Dan|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and "Citizen Kang" was written by [[David X.

The 1996 Presidential election occurred a few days after the airing of this episode.<ref name="Cohen"/> According to Cohen, the Citizen Kang short violated every rule of ''The Simpsons'' as it locked the episode in one time and named specific candidates.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Although, according to Josh Weinstein, "the message is timeless."<ref name="Weinstein"/> There is a rock band named [[I Voted for Kodos]], which Weinstein says is based on this episode.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

The sequence where tiny spaceships attack Bart marks one of the first uses of computers in ''Simpsons'' animation. The computer was used to build models for reference and the animators later retraced it.<ref name="Anderson"/>
