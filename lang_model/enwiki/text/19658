'''V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Airport''' ({{lang-no|V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y flyplass}}) {{Airport codes|VRY|ENVY}} is a closed [[regional airport]] on the island of [[V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y]] in [[Norway]]. It was used between 1986 and 1990 and was operated by the Municipality of V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y. It was plagued with low regularity caused by difficult wind conditions. Following the fatal [[Wider<U+00F8>e Flight 839]] accident, the airport was closed and replaced by [[V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Heliport]]. The airport was served by twelve weekly services to [[Bod<U+00F8>]] and [[R<U+00F8>st]] by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]], who used [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] aircraft.

==History==
Services to V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y started in the mid 1960s, when Wider<U+00F8>e started [[sea plane]] services to the island using [[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter]]s and Norseman aircraft. In 1972, the government wanted to start a helicopter service from [[Bod<U+00F8> Airport]] to V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y and [[R<U+00F8>st]]<U+2014>the island community further out from V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y. Wider<U+00F8>e was granted the concession, but they did not want to operate helicopters, so they subcontracted it to [[Helilift]]. The service operated twice per day on weekdays and once per day in the weekends. The service was provided using two sixteen-seat [[Sikorsky H-34|Sikorsky S-58T]]s. In 1973, {{NOK|1.9 million}} was granted in subsidies for the route, and the service transported 5,359 passengers (from both R<U+00F8>st and V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y).<ref> Arnesen, 1984: 124<U+2013>125</ref> In December 1976, one of the helicopters was bought by Wider<U+00F8>e and operations subcontracted to [[Offshore Helicopters]]. The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters. In 1980, [[Helikopter Service]] merged with Offshore Helicopters, and the new Helikopter Service took over the route.<ref> Arnesen, 1984: 134</ref> From 1 January 1982, Helikopter Service started operating an eleven-seat [[Bell 212]] helicopters because the Sikorskys cost too much to maintain. In 1982, the service to both islands transport 7,145 passengers and {{convert|3|t}} of post and cargo, and made 744 landings. It received subsidies for NOK&nbsp;4 million.<ref> Arnesen, 1984: 140</ref>

Plans for an airport with [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] flights was launched by the government in December 1983. The airport was proposed along with five other regional airports: [[Fagernes Airport, Leirin]], [[F<U+00F8>rde Airport, Bringeland]], [[Mosj<U+00F8>en Airport, Kj<U+00E6>rstad]], [[R<U+00F8>rvik Airport, Ryum]] and [[R<U+00F8>st Airport]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fem fly plasser bygges |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=16 December 1983 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Construction was approved by the [[Parliament of Norway]] on 10 April 1984 and construction started in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |title=Samferdselskomiteen sluttbehandler luftfartsmeldingen: <U+00D8>ket sikkerhet p<U+00E5> Fornebu |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Malm<U+00F8> |first=Morten |date=11 April 1984 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 22 August 1985, the municipality was granted concession to operate the airport.<ref>{{cite news |title=V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y lufthavn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=22 August 1985 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Nordlandet, on the north side of the island, was chosen as the location of the airport. It is located on level section of land; just south of the runway is the {{convert|465|m}} tall mountain Teisthammeren.<ref>Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 24</ref> During the preliminary studies, the [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]] had made a favorable report about the weather in the area, but there had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren. Wider<U+00F8>e was opposed to that location of the airport.<ref>{{cite news |title=V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y-ulykka |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Gustad |first=Ragnhild |date=1 March 1991 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 1 June 1986, V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y and R<U+00F8>st Airports were opened, after NOK&nbsp;15 million had been spent on constructing V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Airport.<ref name=opening>{{cite news |title=Nye flyplasser p<U+00E5> V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y og R<U+00F8>st  |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Veig<U+00E5>rd |first=Erik |date=2 June 1986 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> It has a {{convert|800|by|30|m|adj=on}} runway with [[instrument landing system]]<ref name=opening /><ref>Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 25</ref> and a terminal building with a caf<U+00E9>. The airport was connected to the rest of the island with a dirt road.<ref name=vg>{{cite news |title=V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y lufthavn stengt for fly |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |author=Ingebrigtsen, Terje and Roger Mortensen |date=29 September 1997 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Airport was plagued with bad wind conditions and low regularity. The airport had the highest number of cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation.<ref>{{cite news |title=V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y flyplass med d<U+00E5>rlig regularitet  |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Veig<U+00E5>rd |first=Erik |date=23 July 1987 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. In 1989, the instrument landing system was moved to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and a wind measurer was installed on the mountain, costing NOK&nbsp;1 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bedre regularitet p<U+00E5> V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y flyplass |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=29 March 1989  |language=Norwegian}}</ref> From 31 October 1988, Wider<U+00F8>e introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090<U+00B0><U+2013>240<U+00B0> (though south) if the wind speed exceeded {{convert|20|kn}}, including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.<ref>Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 36<U+2013>38</ref>

On 12 April 1990, [[Wider<U+00F8>e Flight 839]] crashed one minute after take-off, killing all five on board. The cause of the accident was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport.<ref name=cause>Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 59</ref> The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no plane has ever taken off from V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Airport after Flight 839. In 1992, the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]] decided to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. In 1995, [[V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y Heliport]] was opened further south on the island, and Helikopter Service was awarded the [[public service obligation]] to operate the route. The helicopter service sometimes uses the closed airport as a reserve airport during bad weather.<ref name=vg />

==Airlines and destinations==
The airport was served by Wider<U+00F8>e using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bod<U+00F8><U+2013>R<U+00F8>st<U+2013>V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y<U+2013>Bod<U+00F8> on weekdays and one round trip during the weekend. In addition, there were two weekly trips that connected V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y to [[Leknes Airport]] before returning to Bod<U+00F8>. The service was subsidized by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications]].<ref name=opening />

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 19 January 1989, a Wider<U+00F8>e Twin Otter became uncontrollable due to turbulence during [[final approach (aviation)|final approach]] to V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y. Control was regained when there was {{convert|80|m}} hight above the sea. This incident caused the airport to be temporarily closed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nesten-ulykke med Wider<U+00F8>e-fly p<U+00E5> V<U+00E6>r<U+00F8>y onsdag |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=19 January 1989  |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
* On 12 April 1990, [[Wider<U+00F8>e Flight 839]] crashed one minute after take-off, killing all five on board. It was caused by high wind speeds, in excess of the construction dimensions, cracking the tail rudder and vertical stabilizer, crashing the plane in the sea after eight seconds.<ref name=cause />
