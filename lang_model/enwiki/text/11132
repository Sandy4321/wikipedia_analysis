The '''Wales national rugby union team''' represent [[Wales]] in international [[rugby union]] tournaments. They compete annually in the [[Six Nations Championship]] with [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]]. Wales have won the Six Nations 23 times, second only to England, their last Championship came in [[2005 Six Nations Championship|2005]]. They also compete in the [[Rugby World Cup]] every four years. The [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) regards Wales as a ''Tier One'' rugby nation, and currently ranks them tenth in the world.<ref name="rankings">Ranking archives can be found at the IRB website; [http://www.irb.com/rankings/analysis/index.html www.irb.com/rankings/analysis/index.html]</ref>

The governing body, the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] (WRU), was established in 1881, the same year that Wales played their first international against England. Wales' performances in the Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations) continued to improve, experiencing their first 'golden age' between 1900 and 1911. They first played New Zealand, known as the [[All Blacks]], in 1905, when they defeated them 3&ndash;0 in a famous match at Cardiff Arms Park. Welsh rugby struggled between the first and second World Wars, but experienced a second 'golden age' between 1969 and 1982 when they won several Five Nations [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slams]]. They played in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] where they achieved their best ever result of third. Following the professionalisation of rugby in 1995, Wales hosted the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] and, in 2005, won their first-ever Six Nations Grand Slam.

Wales play in red jerseys embroidered with the [[Prince of Wales's feathers]]. Their current home ground is the [[Millennium Stadium]], completed in 1999 to replace the National Stadium at [[Cardiff Arms Park]]. Ten former Welsh players have been inducted into the [[International Rugby Hall of Fame]].

==History==
Rugby union took root in Wales in 1850, when Reverend [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] became Vice-Principal at [[St David's College]], [[Lampeter]], where he introduced the sport. The first Welsh club, [[Neath RFC|Neath]] was formed in 1871. In 1881, Wales played their first informal international against England on [[19 February]]; England won by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil.

===Early years (1850&ndash;1919)===
[[Image:Wales Rugby1905.jpg|thumb|right|Wales' 1905 team that defeated New Zealand.]]
On [[12 March]] 1881, the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] was formed at The Castle Hotel, [[Neath]].<ref name="Hist1880s">{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1880s.htm |title=Historical Rugby Milestones 1880s |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> Two years later, the [[Six Nations Championship|Home International Championship]] was first played and Wales did not register a win.<ref name="SixNationsResults">{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/6nations.htm |title=6 Nations History |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=2007-08-12 }}</ref>

However, rugby union in Wales quickly developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation<U+2014>with seven backs and eight forwards, instead of six backs and nine forwards<U+2014>revolutionised the sport and was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level. With the "four three-quarter" formation Wales became Home International Championships for the first time in 1893; in the process winning the ''[[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]]''.<ref name="SixNationsHist">{{cite web| url=http://www.6-nations-rugby.com/sixnations_history.htm |title=A Brief History of the Six Nations Rugby Tournament|publisher=6-nations-rugby.com |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> Wales next won the Championship in 1900, heralding the first 'golden age' of Welsh rugby which was to last until 1911.<ref name="WelshIndigenous">{{cite journal| title=Welsh Indigenous! and British Imperial?<U+2013>Welsh Rugby, Culture, and Society 1890<U+2013>1914 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=18 |number=3 |year=1991 |last=Andrews |first=David}}</ref> They won two more Triple Crowns in 1902 and 1905, and were runners up in 1901, 1903 and 1904.<ref name="SixNationsResults"/> 

[[Image:Wales-v-New-Zealand-1905.jpg|left|frame|A line-out in the Wales victory over New Zealand's [[The Original All Blacks|Original All Blacks]] in 1905.]]In late 1905, Wales played their first Test against opposition from outside the [[Home Nation]]s when they faced New Zealand's ''[[All Blacks]]'' at [[Cardiff Arms Park]]. New Zealand, later known as the [[Original All Blacks]], were undefeated on their tour of the British Isles, already defeating England, Ireland and Scotland in three Tests before facing Wales.<ref name="OriginalABs">{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbymuseum.co.nz/asp/container_pages/normal_menu/rmArticle.asp?IDID=150 |title=THE 1905/06 'ORIGINALS' |publisher=rugbymuseum.co.nz |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref> Before the match, the All Blacks' performed the [[Haka of the All Blacks|haka]] (a [[Maori]] posture dance); the 47,000-strong crowd responded with the Welsh national anthem<U+2014>''[[Hen Wlad fy Nhadau]]'' ("Land of Our Fathers")<U+2014>the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture.<ref name="OriginalABs"/> Wales' {{Wing}}er Teddy Morgan scored first to give Wales a 3&ndash;0 lead, but later in the match All Black [[Bob Deans]] claimed to have scored a try, only to be dragged behind the line before the referee could arrive.

In 1906, Wales again won the Home Championship,<ref name="SixNationsResults"/>, later that year playing the Souuth African national side, [[South Africa national rugby union team|the ''Springboks'']] for the first time. Wales were expected to defeat the South Africans but instead South Africa dominated in the forwards and eventually won 11&ndash;0.<ref name="BBCWalesSA">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/5388786.stm |title=Mighty Boks: South African rugby |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=[[2006-09-28]] |last=Davies |first=Sean }}</ref><ref name="WalesSAH2H">{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbydata.com/wales/southafrica/gamesplayed/2 |publisher=rugbydata.com |accessdate=2007-08-12 |title=Wales vs South Africa > Games Played }}</ref> Two years later, on [[12 December]] [[1908]], Wales played her first match against Australia's national side, [[Australia national rugby union team|the ''Wallabies'']]), defeating them 9&ndash;6.<ref name="BBCWalesAus">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/4206152.stm |title=Wallaby wonders: Aussie rugby |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=[[2005-09-22]] |last=Davies |first=Sean }}</ref>

In 1909, Wales won the Home Championship and then, in 1910, the first-ever Five Nations (which now included [[France national rugby union team|France]] as the fifth nation). In 1911, Wales took the first official [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]] by winning all their matches in the Five Nations; it would be nearly forty years before they took it again.<ref name="SixNationsResults"/> England's defeat of Wales at Cardiff in 1913 was Wales' first home loss to one of the Home Nations since 1899 (and the first loss at home to England since 1895).<ref name="Smith198">Smith (1980), pg 198.</ref> The Great War came in 1914 and rugby was suspended for the duration.

===Post-war years (1920&ndash;1968)===
[[Image:Ireland-v-Wales-1920.jpg|right|frame|[[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] versus Wales. (1920s illustration)]]
The post-[[World War I|First World War]] years marked a decline in Welsh rugby. The worst period was during the 1920s when the team's lacklustre performance seemed to mirror the industrial recession, which hit South Wales particularly hard. Of the 42 matches played, only 17 were won and three drawn.<ref name="Smith204">Smith (1980), pg 204.</ref> The depression resulted in around half-a-million people leaving Wales to find work elsewhere,<ref name="Richards123">Richards (2006), pg 123.</ref>, including many Welsh rugby union internationals who moved to rugby league.<ref name="Richards124">Richards (2006), pg 124.</ref> Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories &mdash; five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928.<ref name="Richards126">Richards (2006), pg 126.</ref> Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; only one person, Charlie Pugh, played in all four matches.<ref name="Smith204"/>

[[Image:Starting-An-Attack-.jpg|left|frame|Starting An Attack: painting of the [[England national rugby union team|England]] versus Wales rugby match at [[Twickenham stadium|Twickenham]] in 1931.]]
A resurgence of both economy and rugby union followed in the 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years. That year, for the first time since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive Tests when they faced England and Scotland.<ref name="Smith262">Smith (1980), pg 262.</ref> Then, in 1933, captained by [[Watcyn Thomas]], Wales defeated England at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] for the first time.<ref name="Richards135">Richards (2006), pg 135.</ref> In [[1935]], Wales beat the touring All Blacks by 13&ndash;12, with [[Haydn Tanner]] making his first appearance.

Following the Second World War, Wales played a New Zealand Army team (''the Kiwis'') in 1946, which Wales lost 11&ndash;3.<ref name="McLean147">McLean (1969), pg 147.</ref> The Five Nations (suspended during the war) resumed in 1947 when Wales shared the title with England.

The next year, they lost to the touring South Africans 6&ndash;3 despite dominating in the line-outs.<ref name="Smith344">Smith (1980), pg 344.</ref> They achieved another Grand Slam in 1952, followed by a 13&ndash;8 win over the All Blacks in 1953. In 1954, [[St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground|St Helens]] in Swansea (the Welsh international venue since 1885) hosted its last international and Cardiff Arms Park officially became the home of the Welsh team.<ref name="Smith349">Smith (1980), pg 349.</ref> In 1956, Wales again won the Five Nations, but they would not regain the title until 1964 and would not win it outright until 1965.

Wales conducted their first overseas tour in 1964, playing several games and one Test in South Africa.<ref name="Smith368">Smith (1980), pg 368.</ref> They lost the Test against South Africa in [[Durban]] 24&ndash;3, their biggest defeat in 40 years.<ref name="RugbyChronology">{{cite web |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/index.cfm?fuseaction=faqs.chronology |title=Rugby Chronology |publisher=rfu.com |accessdate=2007-08-28 }}</ref> At the WRU annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D.

===Second 'golden age' (1969&ndash;1982)===
When Wales defeated England in the 1969 Five Nations to win the Triple Crown and the championship, it ushered in the second 'golden age'. Wales toured New Zealand for the first time that year, but were defeated in both Tests. As well as losing the first Test 19&ndash;0, and the second 33&ndash;12,<ref name="McLean144">McLean (1969), pg 144.</ref> they also conceded 24 points to the All Blacks' {{fullback}} [[Fergie McCormick]] in the second Test; a record at the time.<ref name="McLean119">McLean (1969), pg 119.</ref>

In 1970, Wales shared the Five Nations with France, also recording their best result thus far against South Africa with a 6&ndash;6 draw in Cardiff.<ref name="Smith400">Smith (1980), pg 400.</ref> In 1971, Wales recorded their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1952.

In the [[1972 Five Nations Championship]], Wales and Scotland refused to travel to Dublin at the height of [[the Troubles]] after receiving threats, purportedly from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]].<ref name="1972FN">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1193077.stm |title=Sport in chaos as crisis deepens |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-09-20 |date=[[2001-02-27]] }}</ref> The Championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. Although the Five Nations was a five way tie in 1973, the Welsh did defeat Australia 24&ndash;0 in Cardiff.<ref name="Smith432">Smith (1980), pg 432.</ref>

Wales next won the Five Nations outright in 1975, after sharing it with the four other countries in 1973. In 1976, Wales won their second Grand slam of the decade. Just like the first in 1971, they only used 16 players over their four matches. They repeated the feat in 1978 and, in the process, became the first team to win three consecutive Triple Crowns. Following their final Five Nations match of 1978, both [[Phil Bennett]] and [[Gareth Edwards]] retired from rugby.<ref name="WelshGrandSlams"/> Later that year, Wales played the All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park, losing 13&ndash;12 after a late penalty goal by the replacement All Black fullback, [[Brian McKechnie (cricketer)|Brian McKechnie]].<ref name="ABGame741">{{cite web |url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?MT_ID=1741 |title=180th All Black Test : 741st All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}</ref> The penalty was controversial because All Black {{lock}} [[Andy Haden]] had dived out of a [[line-out]] in an attempt to earn a penalty. Haden admitted in November 1989<U+2014>on the eve of that year's Wales match against New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park<U+2014>that he and Frank Oliver had pre-agreed this foul tactic should the All Blacks find themselves in difficulties.  Although the incident looks obvious from the videotape (and referee Roger Quittenton was roasted by the press for failing to notice it), at the time the only journalist to comment was [[Clem Thomas]]. Visibility was not ideal but Quittenton later claimed (with mixed success) that he had actually given the penalty against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of [[Frank Oliver (rugby player)|Frank Oliver]]. Whom one believes tends to reflect whom one supports though Welsh fans claim a moral victory that day. Haden later admitted that he was both surprised and delighted that his ploy worked. <ref name="HadenDive">{{cite news |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/news/newswire.php/news/reuters/2005/11/24/sport/mouriehasmixedemotionsoverhadendive.html |title=Mourie has mixed emotions over Haden dive |publisher=tiscali.co.uk |accessdate=2007-09-21  |date=[[2005-11-24]] |last=Mehaffey |first=John }}</ref> The All Blacks went on to secure their first Home Nations Grand Slam.<ref>This is victory over England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales all on the same tour.</ref>

Wales were still respected by the time of the first official [[Rugby World Cup]] in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]]. After defeating England in the quarter-finals, Wales faced hosts the All Blacks. Although the All Blacks won 49&ndash;6, Wales managed to beat Australia in the third place play-off game to claim third.<ref name="1987RWC">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/1987.asp |title=1987 Rugby World Cup Results |publisher=worldcupweb.com |accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> The next year Wales won the Triple Crown for the first time since 1979, but heavy defeats on tour to New Zealand later that year saw the end of a number of Welsh players' careers, as many converted to rugby league.<ref name="ABMagic"/> 

In 1990, Wales suffered their first Five Nations championship [[whitewash]] and, in 1991 narrowly avoided the same fate by earning one point for a draw with Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park. In the [[1991 Rugby Union World Cup|1991 World Cup]], Wales lost their first group phase game against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Manu Samoa]]. They subsequently beat Argentina's [[Argentina national rugby union team|''Pumas'']] but lost heavily to eventual champions Australia and were thus knocked out before reaching the quarter-finals.<ref name="RWC1991">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/1991.asp |title=1991 Rugby World Cup Results |publisher=worldcupweb.com |accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> After winning two Five Nations games in 1992, and one in 1993, Wales won the Championship in 1994.<ref name="SixNationsResults"/><ref>Wales won this Championship on points difference as both Wales and England won three games each.</ref> After again not qualifying for the World Cup quarter-finals in 1995,<ref name="RWC1995">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/WCrugby/1995.asp |title=1995 Rugby World Cup Results |publisher=worldcupweb.com |accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Kevin Bowring became Wales' first professional coach when he replaced Alex Evans that year.

Coached by [[Mike Ruddock]], Wales won their first Six Nations Grand Slam in [[2005 Six Nations Championship|2005]]. They opened with an 11&ndash;9 win over England at the Millennium Stadium, thanks to a late long range penalty from [[Gavin Henson]]. After a win over Italy, Wales faced France, and were losing 15&ndash;6 at half-time. Wales fought back in the second half to win 24&ndash;18, and the game was named the best of the tournament. Wales beat Scotland away (46&ndash;22) and then, in front of a capacity crowd at the Millennium Stadium, played their final game against Ireland.

Rugby union and Wales' national team hold an important place in Welsh culture and society. Sport historian John Bale has stated that "rugby is characteristically Welsh", and David Andrew said that "To the popular consciousness, rugby is as Welsh as coal mining, male voice choirs, '[[How Green Was My Valley]],' [[Dylan Thomas]], and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]".<ref name="Andrews336">Andrews (1991), pg 336.</ref> Welsh rugby's first 'golden age' (1910&ndash;1911) coincided with the country's zenith during the 20th century,<ref name="Andrews337">Andrews (1991), pg 337.</ref> and rugby was important in building Wales' modern identity.<ref name="Morgan434">Morgan (2005), pg 434.</ref>

==Record==
=== Six Nations ===
Wales' only annual tournament is the [[Six Nations Championship]], which is played against five other European nations: England, France, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. The Six Nations started as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, as a contest between the four component nations of the United Kingdom. Wales first won it in 1893, when they achieved a [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]].<ref name="SixNationsHist"/> Wales have won the tournament outright 23 times, and shared ten other victories. Their longest wait between championships was 11 years (1994&ndash;2005). Wales first won a Five Nations [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] in 1911,<ref name="SixNationsResults"/> and their one and only Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005.

{{Six Nations wins}}

===World Cup===
Wales have contested every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. The 1987 tournament was Wales' most successful; they won all three pool matches and their quarter-final, before losing to the All Blacks in the semi-finals. They then faced Australia in the third place play-off match, which they won 22&ndash;21.<ref name="1987RWC"/> In the next two tournaments in 1991 and 1995, Wales failed to progress beyond the pool stage, winning just one match in each tournament.<ref name="RNV38I9PG32-33">{{citation |magazine=Rugby News |title=Pool B |volume=38 |issue=9 |page=38 |year=2007 }}</ref> Both the 1999 and 2003 tournaments were more successful, with Wales qualifying for the quarter-finals both times. Wales hosted the event in 1999 and topped their pool only to lose to eventual winners Australia in the quarter-finals.<ref name="1999RWC"/> In 2003, they finished second in their pool to the All Blacks and faced England in the quarter-finals, where they lost to the eventual champions, despite scoring more tries than their opponents.<ref name="2003RWC"/> In the 2007 World Cup, Wales again failed to progress from the pool stage. After a loss to Australia, and two wins against Japan and Canada, they lost by four points to Fiji, despite scoring more tries than their opponents.<ref name="2007RWC"/>

===Overall===
[[Image:Wales rugby union ranking.png|thumb|450px|right|Wales' [[IRB World Rankings|world ranking]] from [[10 October]] [[2003]] to [[5 November]] [[2007]].]]Wales have won 302 of their 586 Test matches, a win percentage of 51.54 (see table). When the [[IRB World Rankings|world rankings]] were introduced in October 2003, Wales were ranked eighth. They rose to seventh in June 2004, before falling back to eighth in November that year. During the [[2005 Six Nations Championship]], they rose to their highest ranking position; fifth. They fell to ninth by June 2006, and, after rising back to eighth by September, fell to tenth after the 2007 World Cup.<ref name="rankings"/>

==Coaches==
Following the unsuccessful tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up a working party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team's first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned not to have a coach tour with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's [[annual general meeting]], the decision was reversed and [[Clive Rowlands]] was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.<ref name="DevelopmentofCoaching"/>
