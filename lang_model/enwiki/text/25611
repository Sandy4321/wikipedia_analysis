'''Paul Robinson''' is a [[fictional character]] from the Australian [[Network Ten]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'', a long-running [[serial drama]] about [[Social relation|social life]] in the fictional Melbourne suburb of [[Erinsborough]]. He is played by [[Stefan Dennis]]. Paul debuted in the serial's first episode in 1985 and appeared on a regular basis until 1992 when Dennis quit the serial to pursue other projects. Dennis briefly reprised the role in 1993. Dennis returned to ''Neighbours'' full time in 2004. He later said it had been a mistake to leave the series. Paul was created by producer [[Reg Watson]] as one of ''Neighbours''<nowiki>'</nowiki> original characters. He made his debut in the soap's first episode on 18 March 1985 and is the only original character still featured in current episodes.

In the late 1980s Paul evolved into a powerful and sometimes villainous business man. In 2007, as part of the reinvention of the serial, Paul's evil ways were mellowed through a [[brain tumor]] plot. Dennis has often spoke of his admiration for Paul's evil persona, stating it is what makes him an entertaining character. He has been at the centre of many high profile storylines including money laundering, a leg [[amputation]], been held hostage, convicted to time in prison and many scams against fellow characters. He has been married five times and had countless affairs, proving to be an intense womaniser. Paul's evil side and his womanising have been well received by critics who deemed his personality as entertaining. Dennis has garnered various award nominations for his portrayal of Paul.

==Character development==
===Characterisation===
[[File:Paul Robinsin First Episode.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Paul as he appeared in the first episode of ''Neighbours'']]
In his early years in the serial Paul is shown to be the quiet member of his family. He previously worked as an air steward.<ref name="factfile">{{cite book|authors=Wallis, Neil and Hogan, Dave|title=The Neighbours factfile|year=1989|publisher=Angus & Robertson|isbn=0-20716-382-0|page=67|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OyF8QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Neighbours+factfile&cd=1|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref> Paul's failed marriage to [[Terry Inglis]] ([[Maxine Klibingaitis]]) changed his persona and he became self-centered.<ref name="factfile"/> Network Ten publicity have stated it turned him "bitter and cynical".<ref name="z"/> He later transforms into a powerful businessman managing the Lassisters complex, he housed many overpowering traits which made him appear as a control freak and a money-grabber.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=Josephine|title=Neighbours: the first 10 years|year=1996|publisher=[[Penguin Group|Michael Joseph LTD (Penguin Group)]]|isbn=0718142128|page=93|url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/neighbours_a11.html|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> In this time he surprised others as he showed moments of kindness, mainly to his grandmother [[Helen Daniels]] ([[Anne Haddy]]). He has been described as always noticing talent in others, often employing those who shared his ambition and [[nous]].<ref name="book"/>

Paul has been portrayed as a deceiving villain, often participating in unpredictable actions.<ref name="z">{{cite web|url=http://neighbours.com.au/paul-robinson-character.htm|title=Paul Robinson: Characters: Neighbours|work=Neighbours.com.au|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=2010-05-06<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vomrAr4V|archivedate=18 January 2011 -->}}</ref> Dennis describes these points stating: "He's a character you never get bored with. Even during times when storylines aren't centred on my character, the writers still come up with little twists for him all the time."<ref name="wot"/> Network Ten state Paul was a high flying business man in his early days, they comment on how he enjoyed womanising during that time, until he met [[Gail Robinson (Neighbours)|Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). He has been branded a "lothario" and a "serial cheat".<ref name="z"/> On his return in 2004, he was portrayed in his old ways. They pass comment on the fact he was committing dodgy deals and deceiving his neighbours in a bid for revenge.<ref name="z"/> They also describe him as despising pity, being a damaged personality and noting that he can never be faithful to a partner.<ref name="z"/> 

Following his brain tumor removal, Paul mellowed in his evil ways.<ref name="z"/> Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumor, Dennis compared the differences stating: "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference now is that he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd and a lot more careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion."<ref name="ds">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a136164/stefan-dennis-paul-robinson-neighbours.html|title=Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson, 'Neighbours')|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=David|last=Balls|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2010-05-07<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vomuyaYP|archivedate=18 January 2011 -->}}</ref>

(2009)}}

Although Paul changed his ways to an extent, he still shows signs of being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, [[Alan Fletcher]] ([[Karl Kennedy]]) purposely portray hints of his former self.<ref name="ds"/> Of this Dennis stated: "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character he is at the moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out the corner of his eye and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'"<ref name="ds"/> Dennis later defended his character to the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/postfeatures/2009/08/21/aussie-actor-dennis-ready-for-wolverhampton-return-65233-24493986/|title=Aussie actor Stefan Dennis ready for Wolverhampton return|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|author=Jones, Alison|date=2009-08-21|accessdate=2010-05-07<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5von18AvF|archivedate=18 January 2011 -->}}</ref> Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".<ref name="tnt">{{cite news|url=http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/2476560778.html|title=Interview with The Neighbours Star Stefan Dennis|publisher=TNT|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2010-05-08<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5von3UORO|archivedate=18 January 2011 -->}}</ref>

===Relationships===
Paul enjoyed a relationship with Terri, he believed he really loved her. She tried to defraud him and later kill him. These events have a knock on effect which plagues his relationship with Gail raising many trust issues. He has been described as "unlucky in love" during his early years in the serial.<ref name="factfile"/>

During an interview with entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth.<ref name="ds"/> Paul's relationship with [[Izzy Hoyland]] ([[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]]) created many storylines for both characters as they both plotted against their neighbours, with their similar deceiving personalities. Of this Dennis stated: "The Paul and Izzy relationship was fantastic, it was very popular. Izzy was an interesting character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's what drove her evil ways. She had a bit of a soulmate in Paul, but it couldn't work in the end because they would just destroy each other."<ref name="ds"/> During his time as what Dennis branded Paul as "Mr. Evil", he commented on Paul's harsh treatment of women, saying that he treated them like toys, throwing them away when he was bored.<ref name="ds"/>

Paul's relationship with [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: "The Lyn story was quite sincere, but he had the good sense on the day of the wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him."<ref name="ds"/> His relationship with [[Rebecca Robinson (Neighbours)|Rebecca Napier]] ([[Jane Hall (actress)|Jane Hall]]) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like [[Angie Watts|Angie]] and [[Den Watts|Dirty Den]]. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as hard as she does."<ref name="ds"/>

Paul's relationship with his children is often non-conventional, however he has a close bond with his daughter [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]), Dennis describes this, adding: "(She's 'a chip off the old block') and even though Elle annoys Paul sometimes, they are always there for each other. Paul adores his daughter and I think it works both ways."<ref name="wot"/>

===Leg amputation===
One of Paul's main storyline's culminated in him having his leg amputated after an accident.<ref name="tnt"/> The storyline has received some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg.<ref name="low"/> Dennis explained during an interview how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid so it looks like I actually do have a non-moving piece. One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed."<ref name="tnt"/>

===6000th episode===
In July 2010 it was revealed that Paul would be central to the serial's 6000th episode.<ref name="sixthousand">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Paul twist for 6,000th 'Neighbours' ep|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a243572/paul-twist-for-6000th-neighbours-ep.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-09-08|date=14 July 2010}}</ref> Executive producer Susan Bower had hinted previously that the milestone would involve Paul<ref name="g4tu">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Neighbours' boss teases 6,000th episode|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a232017/neighbours-boss-teases-6000th-episode.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-09-08|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> and Alan Fletcher teased audiences with the revelation that something horrible would happen to an iconic character.<ref name="ewry8o">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Fletcher: 'Ramsay St will be torn apart'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a235260/fletcher-ramsay-st-will-be-torn-apart.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=2010-09-08|date=29 June 2010}}</ref> Of Paul's involvement and the reasoning behind it Bower explained: "As Stefan Dennis - Paul Robinson - was in the first episode 25 years ago, it was decided that his character play a most important role in this very special event [...] Paul Robinson, or P.R as we like to call him, has been up to his usual tricks over the past few weeks and everyone on Ramsay Street is becoming really sick of him.

==Storylines==
===Backstory===
Paul is the oldest child of [[Jim Robinson (Neighbours)|Jim Robinson]] ([[Alan Dale]]) and his wife Anne. His half sister [[Julie Martin|Julie]] (Vikki Blanche) was born the year afterward followed by brother [[Scott Robinson (Neighbours)|Scott]] ([[Jason Donovan]]), half brother [[Glen Donnelly|Glen]] (Richard Huggett) and finally his youngest sister [[Lucy Robinson|Lucy]] ([[Kylie Flinker]]). Anne died giving birth to Lucy, when Paul was only twelve and Paul's grandmother, Helen moved into the Robinson house to help Jim with the children. Paul was her self-confessed favourite.

===1985<U+2013>1993===
Paul married Terry Inglis after a whirlwind relationship. However, Terry shot Paul when he found out she killed her ex-husband and she went on the run. Terry was eventually arrested and later committed suicide in prison. Paul meets Gail Lewis for the second time, having worked with her previously, when she applies for a job at the Daniels Corporation. They both agree to enter into a marriage of convenience in order to secure a business agreement, but soon develop genuine feelings for each other and they renewed their vows. That same year Paul learned that he had fathered a child, Amy Robinson, with Nina Williams. Gail was convinced that Paul would lose interest in IVF treatment or adoption, but Paul became more committed to having children with Gail. After IVF treatment, Gail becomes pregnant with triplets, however, Paul starts working hard and becomes detached from Gail. When he leaves Gail's late father's wake to go to work, Gail decides to leave him and moves to Tasmania where she gives birth to [[Elle Robinson|Elle]] ([[Pippa Black]]), [[List of Neighbours characters (2006)#Robert Robinson|Robert Robinson]] and [[List of Neighbours characters (2006)#Cameron Robinson|Cameron Robinson]] ([[Adam Hunter (actor)|Adam Hunter]]). The couple were later divorced. Paul faced financial troubles when [[Hilary Robinson]] ([[Anne Scott-Pendlebury]]) withdrew her funding of the Daniels Corporation.

Paul leases his house to twin sisters [[Christina Alessi]] ([[Gayle & Gillian Blakeney|Gayle Blakeney]]) and [[Caroline Alessi]] ([[Gayle & Gillian Blakeney|Gillian Blakeney]]). Christina falls in love with Paul and after a short romance and a quick engagement, the couple married. Shortly after, Christina became pregnant and gave birth to a son, [[Andrew Robinson (Neighbours)|Andrew]] (Shannon Holmes). Paul suffers a nervous breakdown and cheats on Christina with Caroline. The couple eventually reunite and they leave to manage a branch of Lassiters in Hawaii. Paul later returns to the street where he gets his brother-in-law, [[Philip Martin (Neighbours)|Philip Martin]] ([[Ian Rawlings]]), involved in a fraud scandal. Paul then flees to Brazil and asks Christina to join him. He returns for Helen's birthday, but the celebration is ruined when he is forced to flee the country on fraud charges. Paul returns to Australia after the death of Helen and is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.

===2004 onward===
When the Lassiters complex is set on fire, Paul joins the gathered crowd and watches alongside them. It was later revealed that Paul had started the blaze and killed Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), whose body was found amongst the rubble. He exhibited some supposedly out-of-character behaviour compared to his much earlier stint. He met and befriended [[Dylan Timmins]] ([[Damien Bodie]]), taking him under his wing as a business partner and the two developed a father-son relationship over time. Paul began an affair with [[Liljana Bishop]] ([[Marcella Russo]]), but she ended it because she still loved her husband, [[David Bishop (Neighbours)|David Bishop]] ([[Kevin Harrington]]). Following an accident, where he is pushed off a cliff, Paul has to have his leg amputated. Paul then begins a relationship with [[Isabelle Hoyland]] ([[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]]).<ref name="holypaul">{{cite news|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/neighbours/cast/paul-robinson-219|title=Paul Robinson - Cast - Neighbours - Holy Soap|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Five (TV channel)|Five]]|accessdate=2010-01-10<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vonOXdIa|archivedate=18 January 2011 -->}}</ref> Izzy tricks him into believing that she loves him, so that she has a place to live.

Paul organises a plane trip to [[Launceston, Tasmania]] to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Lassiter's Hotel. He invites several of his friends along for the trip. During the flight a bomb explodes causing the plane to crash into the sea. Liljana and [[Serena Bishop]] ([[Lara Sacher]]) are lost at sea. David's body is found a few days later. Paul ends his relationship with Izzy. Paul then began receiving poison notes from [[Harold Bishop]] ([[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]]). As Harold tries to overcome the loss of his three family members, the discovery of a note from David blaming Paul for ruining his life, forces him to snap and strangle Paul. Paul survives, but was unaware of who tried to kill him. Harold eventually confesses all to Paul, who forgives him.

Paul's son, Robert, is revealed to have planted the bomb on the plane and Gail returns. Paul and Gail fake a wedding ceremony to lure Robert out of hiding. Robert shoots Paul in the chest, but he survives and Robert is arrested. Robert's twin, Cameron, is accidentally killed by [[Max Hoyland]] ([[Stephen Lovatt]]) and Paul decides to get revenge on him. Paul tries to shoot Max, but is talked out of it. He then tries to rekindle his relationship with Gail, but Paul has sex with another woman and Gail returns home. Paul begins a relationship with [[Lyn Scully]] and proposes to her. Paul then finds himself attracted to [[Rosetta Cammeniti]] ([[Natalie Saleeba]]). They share a kiss when they are trapped in a wine cellar together. Paul marries Lyn, but confesses to the kiss and tells Lyn that he will never be faithful. Lyn is devastated and leaves Ramsay Street. Paul then begins a brief relationship with [[Pepper Steiger]] ([[Nicky Whelan]]).

Paul ruins Elle and Dylan's relationship. He manipulates [[Ned Parker]] ([[Daniel O'Connor (singer)|Daniel O'Connor]]) into debt in a rigged game of poker. Owing Paul, he has to rob the Timmins family and Paul himself so that Paul can claim on the insurance. Dylan later finds out that Paul is responsible for dropping chemical waste into the wetlands through a company called Affirmacon, causing him to be treated for toxins in his body. He discovers that he could have passed it on to Kerry and confronts Paul about it. Dylan kidnaps Paul and plays mind games with him. He then pushes him off a cliff, but Dylan later saves him.

Ruth Deller of entertainment website [[Lowculture]] commented on Paul stating: "He's always been a bit of a ladies' man and has had an eye for a business deal and has always struggled with whether to be good Paul or bad Paul.

Although it's probably safe to say that period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989."<ref name="h"/> He has also been branded as a "legend character".<ref name="tnt"/>

Entertainment reporting website ''Last Broadcast'' praised Paul's development, stating: "As the kind of shady character who<U+2019>d do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street to make way for a new supermarket development. And that<U+2019>s not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn<U+2019>t have sunk.
