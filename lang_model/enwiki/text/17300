The '''Creativity Movement''' (formerly known as ''World Church Of The Creator''), is an often violent [[White separatism|white separatist]] organization that advocates the [[White separatism|whites-only]] religion, ''Creativity''.<ref>Hedda Rosner Kopf, "Understanding Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl: A Student Casebook" (1997) Greenwood Publishing Group at p. 189.</ref> It was also a descriptive phrase used by [[Ben Klassen]], that included all adherents of the religion. The use of the term ''creator'' does not refer to a [[deity]], but rather to themselves ([[white people]]).<ref>Expert: Hatreds rooted in poverty don't thrive here, the Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, MA), [[July 9]], [[1999]]</ref> Despite the former use of the word ''Church'' in its name, the movement is [[atheism|atheistic]].<ref>[http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/c/creativity/ Creativity Movement (formerly known as World Church of the Creator)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Creativity Movement is not affiliated with the [[Creativity Alliance]].

==History==
Creativity is a [[White Separatist]] religion that was founded  by [[Ben Klassen]] in early 1973 under the name Church of the Creator. After Klassen's death in 1993, Creativity almost died out as a religion until the New Church of the Creator was established three years later by [[Matthew F. Hale]] as its [[Pontifex Maximus]] (high priest), until his incarceration in January 2003 for plotting with the movement's head of security, Anthony Evola (an [[FBI]] informant), to murder a federal judge. 

Soon after its establishment in 1996, the New Church of the Creator was renamed the World Church of the Creator (WCOTC). Hale prefixed the name with ''World'' in an effort to symbolize the organization's global mission of attaining a "Whiter and Brighter World." The group was not a direct follow-on from Klassen's Church of the Creator. This meant that [[prior use]] was not a defense when the World Church of the Creator lost a lawsuit in 2002 brought on by an unrelated Christian organization named TE-TA-MA "Truth" Foundation which had previously [[trademark]]ed the name [[Church of the Creator]]. This forced yet another name change to The Creativity Movement (TCM).

==Legal Issues==
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, The Creativity Movement's members have been charged and convicted in over 17 acts of racial violence.<ref name="CMHistory">{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=219| title=Church of the Creator: A History | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date= Summer 1999 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref>

Brian Kozel, 18, a White Racial Loyalist - Creator - White Beret (security group of the movement) was killed on September 15, 1990, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After a conflict on the street with a Hispanic gang, he was shot in the back and died on the scene. The murderer was never found. Kozel is hailed as a martyr by the group. 

In 1991, Harold Mansfield Jr., an [[African-American]] and decorated veteran of the [[Gulf War]], was killed in a parking lot in [[Neptune Beach, Florida]] by George Loeb, a Church of the Creator reverend.<ref name="NYTimes1996">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D12FF3B5D0C738EDDAC0894DE494D81 | title=Supremacist Told to Pay Black Family | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= 1996-05-20 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref> George Loeb was convicted of first-degree [[murder]] on July 29, 1992,  and received a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. His wife Barbara Loeb was sentenced to one year in jail on weapons possession charges. The organization has repeatedly argued that Loeb was acting in self-defense when he committed the act.

Subsequently, the dead man's family successfully sued the organization, winning an award of [[United States dollar|$]]1 million in damages in March 1994.<ref name="NYTimes1996" />  Prior to the lawsuit, Klassen sold the organization's North Carolina compound, which housed its headquarters to Doctor [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]], head of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]].

In 2000, the [[Oregon]]-based TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the Creator for using the name [[Church of the Creator]], which the Oregon group had registered as a [[trademark]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=64 | title=What's in a Name? | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]  |date= Winter 2002 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}</ref> Early in 2002 U.S. District Court Judge [[Joan Humphrey Lefkow]] ruled in favor of the World Church of the Creator.

== Salubrious Living ==
While not a mandatory part of church doctrine, salubrious living is greatly encouraged within the Church. The basic doctrine is laid down by Ben Klassen and Arnold DeVries in the book "Salubrious Living". The program emphasises living in accord with the "Laws of Nature", with personal cleanliness and self-mastery, with avoiding medications or drugs, and with promoting white eugenics.<ref>{{Cite book| url=http://www.creativitymovement.com/eBook-BenKlassen&ArnoldDeVries-SalubriousLiving.pdf | pages = 247| last = Klassen| first = Ben| coauthors = Church of the Creator, Church of the Creator| title = Salubrious Living| date = 1982}}</ref>

== Current: breakup and factionalism ==
Since Hale's conviction, there have been ongoing schisms within the organization, amounting to what was at one time eight independent groups.  The Church of the RaHoWa (the religious arm of the White Crusaders of the RaHoWa<U+2014>itself a break-away group from the Creativity Movement; the word RaHoWa is a contraction of "Racial Holy War" and a battle cry for church members) was one such group.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1559149.htm | title=SA Attorney-General wants racist website closed down | publisher=[[ABC Australia]] | date= 2006-01-31 | first= | last= | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> After police raids on the homes of several of the leading members, the group broke up and the bulk of the adherents of The Church and the White Crusaders of the RaHoWa then left to either join other groups or form newer and smaller independent groups of their own.

As of 2007 Creators have divided into two [[ideologically]] opposed factions. The first has adopted the name '''The Creativity Movement''' (also known as "Skinheads of the Racial Holy War"), and follows the rigid organizational structure set up by Hale. It includes local, state and national leaders under the leadership of its own [[Pontifex Maximus]]. This group has adopted the uncompromising stance that for one to be a Creator, one must be a member of that group. Adherence to Creativity by those outside the group is not permissible.<ref>[http://www.creativitymovement.net/forum Group calling themselves The Creativity Movement want no rivals] The Creativity Movement Forum</ref> Group membership consists of two former members of Hale's Church with some new recruits. It has an outlook that is more in line with the stereotypical skinhead gangs as portrayed in Hollywood films such as ''[[American History X]]'' and ''[[Romper Stomper]]''. The group still owes thousands of dollars in fines and court costs incurred as a result of its trademark dispute with [[Church of the Creator|TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation]].

The second of the two [[ideologically]] opposed factions is known as the "[[Creativity Alliance]]". It follows the loose organizational structure first proposed by [[Ben Klassen]]. This group does not consider itself an organization. It maintains that it is a group of individuals and numerous smaller groups (some of whom label themselves as local variants of the Church of Creativity) that have banded together in an alliance to promote Creativity. The group also has a policy of non-participation in the [[White Power]] social construct. It espouses the belief that for Creativity to survive as a religion, it must become accepted by mainstream society as a viable religion. In short, as opposed to The Creativity Movement, the [[Creativity Alliance]] promotes the adherence of Creativity outside the confines of the group.<ref>[http://www.creativityalliance.com/about.htm The Creativity Alliance is not an organization] About the Creativity Alliance</ref> The group as such has no formal membership or leaders. It consists of its founder and other adherents of Creativity - various individuals and groups, who sometimes refer to themselves as "independent Creators." The predominant makeup of the alliance is of former members of both Klassen's and Hale's churches along with new adherents. The group does not owe money in fines or court costs. As a legal precaution its web pages and published books stress the fact that it makes no attempt to assume or supersede the US registered trademark now owned by [[Church of the Creator|TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation]].<ref>[http://www.creativityalliance.com/downloads.htm The Creativity Alliance makes no attempt to assume or supercede trademark] Legal disclaimer used by the Creativity Alliance</ref>

Due to The Creativity Movement's rigid stance that adherence to Creativity is restricted to members of its own group, neither of the two factions appears willing to reconcile.
