'''San Beda College (SBC)''' (Spanish for [[Saint Bede]]) is a [[college]] run by the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks in the [[Philippines]]. It is located at [[Mendiola|Mendiola Street]] in San Miguel, [[Manila]]. It was founded in 1901 to cope with the ever-growing need of the population for education.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} San Beda, which was known then as ''El Colegio de San Beda'', started as an all-boys elementary school, it has since expanded to include high school department and Colleges of Arts and Science and Law School. Currently, it has three other campuses: the San Beda College-Rizal (the largest San Beda campus in size), and the new extension campus for the College of Law at [[Muntinlupa City]]. It also has a brother school named San Beda College Alabang (formerly known as St. Benedict College and Benedictine Abbey School) located in Alabang Hills in Muntinlupa. Also, the Paul VI Institute of Liturgy in Malaybalay is being managed by the Benedictine monks.

Located in a once quiet, middle-class residential area, San Beda College is now part of Manila's bustling [[University Belt]], an irregular crescent curving for about six kilometers through six districts of Manila, containing more than thirty colleges and universities. 

At present, San Beda College has seven departments: the Basic Education Department; the College of Arts and Sciences, which offers liberal arts, science and business programs; the College of Law, founded in 1948; the Graduate Schools of Business, Liturgy and Law; the College of Medicine, and the College of Nursing.  San Beda opened its doors to female students in 2004 and relocated its Basic Education Department (pre-school to high school) to a new campus in Taytay, Rizal. 

San Beda is a founding member of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) and  the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Its varsity teams are the [[San Beda Red Lions]] with their Team A referred to as Team Animo and Team B as Team Behold. San Beda College Alabang is a member of different sports leagues such as the WNCAA, NCAA South and the National Cheerleading Competition(NCC).

Each classroom has 2 airconditioning units, overhead projectors and, LCD projectors are also provided for each classroom with white screens. A fully air-conditioned and well-lit Conference Hall is also available for use. The school's major athletic facilities include the St. Placid's Sports Complex, the senior football field, the physical fitness room, and the swimming pool.

==Transition==

San Beda College used to be an exclusive school for boys. It became a co-educational institution in 2003.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} It was the same period when the [[Commission on Higher Education]] of the Philippines granted Full Autonomy to the College.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} It also consistently maintained its Level III [[PAASCU]] Accreditation. Upon the granting of Full Autonomy, the College offered Nursing courses and started to transfer its Grade School and High School at Taytay Rizal. The last batch of High School students from Mendiola graduated last [[March 31]] [[2006]] while only two batches of Grade School, Grades 5 and 6, students now remain at the same campus.

==Campus life==

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:SanBedaCollege.JPG|thumb|250px|[[San Beda College]], Main Campus at Mendiola]] -->

San Beda College occupies a 35,000 square metre lot along the historic [[Mendiola Street]] in the City of [[Manila]]. It is easily accessible by private or public transportation. Along its periphery are situated other colleges and universities, dormitories, shopping centers and restaurants. It takes advantage of the second line of the Light Rail Transit System that passes along the busy Claro M Recto Avenue and Legarda Street. 

Though situated at the center of a bustling metropolis near the country's seat of power, the [[Malacanang Palace]], the school maintains a relatively relaxed, urbane and closely-knit environment among the members of the Bedan community.

23 monks work in the school as administrators, chaplains, teachers and guidance counsellors. Grade school and high school classes start at 7.30 in the morning and end in the afternoon, while college classes start in the afternoon and end at 9.30 in the evening. 

The co and extra-curricular activities of San Beda College encourage creative leadership, collaborative management and harmonious empowerment among the students. Each academic department has its own Student Council which closely monitors all activities. To ensure better implementation and relevance to the organization's constitutions and objectives, student organizations are required to submit and if need be, defend a Student Activity Program-Budget Proposal.

===Echoes===
ECHOES is the official yearbook of the College of Arts and Sciences of San Beda College.

===SPIRES===
<!--This section can be trimmed down, with SPIRES being given its own article-->

SPIRES is the official literary journal of San Beda College, College of Arts and Sciences. It was established in 1956, with a 76-page journal with Ret. Rev. Wilfrid Rojo, then college rector as the moderator, Deputy Dean Recaredo V. Enriquez, advisor, and Fortunato Gerardo as the first editor. Gerardo envisioned the journal as a medium for <U+201C>the furtherance of the facility and beauty of expression<U+2026> to expose the trend of writing, the attitude of thinking and intensity of feeling or degree of idealism of students who try to translate their thoughts and emotions into the alphabet of thinking.<U+201D>

Because of the few surviving records and copies of SPIRES, the exact number of publications can no longer be provided and only a few copies of the past issues served as a mirror to the present.  

SPIRES has taken various forms. It has become a research journal with topics ranging from phenomenology, theology, and giving critics of certain trends and ideas of the generation they represent. SPIRES also served as a publication for all the winners of SPIRES literary contest held throughout the Bedan community in Mendiola. From then on, SPIRES catered to a number of writers and has witnessed the times and changes of a generation. Of the recent achievement of the publication, Last 2002, during the 1st Catholic Mass Media Awards, the literary journal was a finalist among a number of publications all throughout the country bested only by Ustetika from the University of Sto. Tomas. Also, in 2005 The SPIRES applied for an  International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). Further, The SPIRES had also been the literary journal to have its pages available to: Benildus Maramba, OSB, Carlos M. Tayag, Jaime Licauco, Rene Saguisag, Bernardo Ma. Perez, OSB, Tarcisio Narciso, OSB, Raul Roco, Herbert Bautista, and Fr. Anscar Chupungco, OSB, to name a few of its hundreds of contributors.

In the 1960s, the journal released three issues per academic year, which gradually fell to two issues. It sometimes took at least two years just to compile a volume of Bedan literature. There were a number of years wherein nothing was heard of the publication such that rumors spread that The SPIRES had become defunct. 

Over the past decade, The Bedan, the student publication of the College of Arts and Sciences realized the need for an avenue for Bedan literature. It was in 1989, thru the initiative of The Bedan literary editor Samuel C.S. Porcalla that The SPIRES was reborn, carrying the cover theme: "The Rebirth". The Bedan served as aide to The SPIRES, which resulted in  confusion that The SPIRES was re-launched under The Bedan. However, The SPIRES and The Bedan are two publications serving different purposes under different management. And while being assisted by The Bedan, the literary journal took a number of facelifts. Aside from text, photos and caricatures are now included in the journal giving The SPIRES a more comprehensive means of communicating the message that it wants to convey to the Bedan community. 

At present, The SPIRES seeks to promote a culture of writing among Bedans.

The GSL offers the Master of Arts in Liturgy, Master of Arts in Liturgical Studies, and Doctorate in Liturgy.{{Fact}] The GSL is believed to be the first and only liturgy school in Asia when it was founded in 2002.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

The Master of Laws program has nothing to do with membership in the Philippine Bar and even if, as a general rule, students should be members of the Philippine Bar this is not an indispensable condition provided that the candidate exhibits the level of competence demanded of doctoral programs and the capacity for research that will result in a genuine contribution to the discipline.

The College of Law in Alabang  does not have its own Charter and license to operate independently from the Main Campus so it is considered as an "Annex" or "Satellite" of the College of Law in Manila as stated and cleared in one of the issues of San Beda College of Law Student Publication.
