== Club career ==
===Vasco da Gama===
Coutinho started his footballing career as part of [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]'s youth system and was bought by Italian [[Serie A]] giants [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in 2008, at the age of 16, for <U+20AC>4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2008/luglio/23/Coutinho_milioni_per_Pato_Moratti_ga_10_080723010.shtml|title=Coutinho, 4 milioni per il Pato di Moratti|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=20 November 2010|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> Coutinho stayed at Vasco on loan until his 18th birthday, becoming a first team player for the Brazilian side despite his young age.

===Internazionale===
[[File:Philippe Coutinho Inter.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Coutinho in training with Internazionale.]]
Coutinho's move to Internazionale became effective on July 2010, after he turned 18, with new head coach [[Rafael Ben<U+00ED>tez]] and chairman [[Massimo Moratti]] being quoted saying that "Coutinho is the future of Inter".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

He made his official debut in an Internazionale jersey as a substitute during the ''Nerazzurri'''s 2<U+2013>0 defeat at the hands of [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]] in the 2010 [[UEFA Super Cup]] final on 27 August 2010. After dropping out of selection in the starting line up, he returned and proved crucial in the 3<U+2013>2 win over Bayern Munich in Germany as he provided a beautiful ball for [[Samuel Eto'o]] after running at the defense, followed by Eto'o setting up [[Wesley Sneijder]] for the second Inter goal; a game which Internazionale would go onto win and progress to the Quarter Finals of the Champions League on the away goals rule.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} On 8 May 2011, he scored his first goal for Internazionale from a free-kick that curled above the wall and into the net in a game that Internazionale won 3<U+2013>1 at home against Fiorentina.

His second goal for Inter came in a match against Cagliari on 19 November 2011 where Coutinho picked up a through ball from his teammate Alvarez to place the ball into the bottom left corner of the net to make it 2<U+2013>0 to Internazionale. He further became involved and staked a claim for his spot when he provided an assist during a game against Fiorentina and was heavily involved in the second goal.
Coutinho has overall 3 goals and 16 assist to his name including all competition for Inter. He moved in and out during year 2011-2012 at Inter and was loaned out to Espanyol.

===Espanyol (loan)===

On 30 January 2012, Coutinho joined Catalan side [[RCD Espanyol]] on loan until the end of the 2011<U+2013>12 season.<ref>[http://www.rcdespanyol.cat/principal.php?modulo=detalleNoticia&idnoticia=12834&idmenu=9&idsubmenu=101&idsite=1 Coutinho ja <U+00E9>s jugador de l'Espanyol]. Rcdespanyol.cat (30 January 2012). Retrieved on 25 March 2013.</ref> Coutinho made his first appearance for RCD Espanyol on 4 February 2012 in a 3<U+2013>3 draw in Bilbao. He scored his first goal for the Catalan side in the ninth minute of a game held on 11 March in a 5<U+2013>1 victory against [[Rayo Vallecano]]. He scored his second goal in the 21st minute of the same game.<ref>[http://www.rcdespanyol.cat/ingles/index.php?modulo=detalleNoticia&idnoticia=789&idseccion=7&Amenu=detalleNoticia 5<U+2013>1: Master piece]. Rcdespanyol.cat (12 March 2012). Retrieved on 25 March 2013.</ref> He continued his fine form as he scored a sublime volley against Racing Santander and a well placed free kick against Malaga. On 18 May 2012, Coutinho made his return to Inter and began training immediately upon arrival to the Angelo Moratti Training Facility.

===Liverpool===
On 26 January 2013, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] reportedly agreed a <U+00A3>8.5m fee with Internazionale for Coutinho, although at that time he was almost a Chelsea player, he was also linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Manchester City, but the player chose Liverpool and was soon pending a medical exam and a work permit from the [[Home Office]] as he did not have enough international appearances to qualify automatically.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2013/01/29/philippe-coutinho-set-for-medical-as-he-closes-in-on-move-for-liverpool-fc-100252-32700231/|title=Philippe Coutinho set for medical as he closes in on move for Liverpool FC|first=James|last=Pearce|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|date=29 January 2013}}</ref> [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] had also expressed an interest in Coutinho, who had played under Southampton manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]] at Espanyol, but Coutinho said he would prefer to join Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Ben|title=Liverpool agree a deal for Inter Milan's Philipe Coutinho|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21204485|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=26 January 2013}}</ref> On 30 January, Liverpool confirmed the signing of Coutinho on a long-term contract after he was successful in his work permit application, and was given the number 10 shirt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/reds-confirm-coutinho-deal|title=Reds confirm Coutinho deal|work=Liverpoolfc.com|date=30 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/new-boy-handed-vacant-no-10-shirt|title=New boy handed vacant No.10 shirt|work=Liverpoolfc.com|date=30 January 2013}}</ref>

He made his debut on 11 February 2013, replacing [[Stewart Downing]] in the 78th minute of a 2<U+2013>0 defeat against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] at [[Anfield]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21318809 "Liverpool 0<U+2013>2 West Brom"] BBC Sport. 11 February 2013. Retrieved 12 February 2013.</ref> Less than a week later, on 17 February he scored his first goal for Liverpool on his full debut in a 5<U+2013>0 victory over [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], 16 seconds into the second half, after an exquisite through ball from [[Luis Suarez]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21438902 "Liverpool 5<U+2013>0 Swansea"] BBC Sport. 17 February 2013. Retrieved 17 February 2013.</ref> On 2 March, he set up Liverpool's first and second goals of the game in a 4<U+2013>0 win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Coutinho scored his second goal for Liverpool in a 3<U+2013>1 away loss to [[Southampton]]. On 31 March, he set up Liverpool's first goal in a 2-1 away win against [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]]. On 27 April, he won the Man of the Match award in Liverpool's 6<U+2013>0 away victory of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Coutinho ran the game for Liverpool, claiming two assists, being heavily involved in another, and winning the free-kick from which [[Jordan Henderson]] added Liverpool's sixth. Coutinho won Player of the Month for Liverpool in March. On 12 May he assisted [[Daniel Sturridge]] for his second and third goals, helping Sturridge claim his first Premier League hat-trick,  in a 1-3 victory over Fulham at [[Craven Cottage]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2323355/Fulham-1-Liverpool-3--match-report-Sturridge-bags-hat-trick-Reds-come-Cottage.html|title=Fulham 1 Liverpool 3: Sturridge bags first hat-trick as Reds come from behind to win at the Cottage|date=12 May 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=14 May 2013 }}</ref> Coutinho scored Liverpool's final goal of the season against [[QPR]] in [[Jamie Carragher|Jamie Carragher's]] final match for the club. [[Jordon Ibe]] began a twisting run before setting the ball off to the Brazilian, who executed a fine driven shot into the bottom left corner from 30 yards out; Ibe was credited with the assist on his Liverpool debut.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2326956/Liverpool-1-QPR-0--match-report.html|title=Coutinho grabs only goal to send retiring Carragher out on a high|date=19 May 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=13 August 2013 }}</ref>
On 16 September 2013, Coutinho injured his shoulder against [[Swansea City]] after a clash with [[Ashley Williams (footballer)|Ashley Williams]] .<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2424363/Philippe-Coutinho-end-October-shoulder-injury.html|title= Huge blow for Liverpool with Coutinho missing until the end of October with shoulder injury|date=18 September 2013|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> He was restored to the starting line-up for the 4-0 victory over [[Fulham F.C]] at Anfield on 9 November. On 23 November, Coutinho scored the opening goal of the [[Merseyside derby]] in the 5th minute. Coutinho created his first assist of the season with a corner in the 5-1 thrashing of Norwich at Anfield. On 26 December, he scored the first half opening goal at Manchester City from a tight angle before City scored twice in the same half to win the game.

==Style of play==
Considered to be a archetypal Brazilian number 10 with trickery, flair, fantastic vision and an eye for goal. Coutinho has been used as an offensive midfielder (trequartista), second striker and on the flanks. He has that vision and passing ability to unlock defences at will with mesmerising through balls, and does so on a consistent basis. He has been compared to [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Ronaldinho]] by former [[Espanyol]] manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]],<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21805388</ref> and has been highly praised by fellow Liverpool teammates.

== International career ==
A key player in the Brazilian squad that won the [[2009 South American Under-17 Football Championship]] scoring 3 goals, Coutinho made his first senior appearance in a [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] shirt on 7 October 2010, starting in a friendly match against [[Iran national football team|Iran]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.goal.com/en/match/52600/iran-vs-brazil/lineup-stats?ICID=OP|title=Iran 0 Brazil 3|date=7 October 2010|work=Goal.com|accessdate=13 August 2013 }}</ref>
