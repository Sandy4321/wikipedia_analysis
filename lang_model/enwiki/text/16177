The '''smooth-fronted caiman''' ('''''Paleosuchus trigonatus'''''), also known as '''Schneider's dwarf caiman''' or '''Schneider's smooth-fronted caiman''',<ref>[http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species.php?genus=Paleosuchus&species=trigonatus ''Paleosuchus trigonatus''], The Reptile Database.</ref> is a crocodilian from [[South America]] where it is native to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco|Orinoco Basin]]s. It is the second smallest species of the [[Alligatoridae]] family, the smallest being [[Cuvier's dwarf caiman]], also from tropical South America and in the same genus. An adult typically grows to around {{convert|1.2|to|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weighs somewhere between {{convert|9|and|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Exceptionally large males can reach as much as {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight.

==Etymology==
The smooth-fronted caiman was [[Species description|first described]] by the German [[Classics|classicist]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Johann Gottlob Schneider]] in 1801. The [[genus]] name ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''palaios'' meaning "ancient" and ''soukhos'' meaning "crocodile". This refers to the belief that this crocodile comes from an ancient lineage that diverged from other species of caiman some thirty million years ago. The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''trigonatus'' is derived from the Greek ''trigonos'' meaning "three-cornered" and [[Latin]] ''atus'' meaning "provided with" and refers to the triangular shape of the head.<ref name=Britton>{{cite web |url=http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_ptri.htm |title=''Paleosuchus palpebrosus'' (Schneider, 1807) |author=Britton, Adam |date=2009-01-01 |work=Crocodilian species list |accessdate=2013-11-04}}</ref>

==Description==
The head of the smooth-fronted caiman is similar in appearance to that of the [[spectacled caiman]] (''Caiman crocodilus'') but there is no bony ridge or "spectacle" between the eyes. The [[scute]]s on the back of the neck and the tail are large, triangular and sharp. It has heavily ossified body armour on both its [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Dorsal_and_ventral|dorsal]] and [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Dorsal_and_ventral|ventral]] surfaces. The relatively short tail is broad at its base and flattened dorso-ventrally in contrast to most species of crocodilians which have laterally flattened tails. The  bony scutes on the tail have sideways projections and the tail is so well armoured that it is relatively inflexible. This caiman is a dark greyish-brown with mid-brown eyes. Males grow to about {{convert|1.7|to|2.3|m}} with the largest recorded specimen being {{convert|2.6|m}}. Females do not often exceed {{convert|1.4|m}}. It is a robust crocodilian, strong for its size and tends to carry its head high with its neck angled upwards.<ref name=Britton/><ref name=Ross>{{cite book |title=Crocodiles and Alligators |last=Ross |first=Charles A.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Paleosuchus trigonatus RDS Uacari.jpg|thumb|left|A smooth-fronted caiman beside a stream]]
The smooth-fronted caiman is native to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco|Orinoco Basin]]s in South America and is found in [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]] and [[Venezuela]]. It inhabits  small streams in forested areas where in some cases, the water may be insufficiently deep for it to completely submerge itself. It is seldom seen in open areas and does not usually bask in the sun, even in captivity.<ref name=Ross/><ref name=Magnusson1991>{{cite journal |author=Magnusson, William E.; Lima, Albertina P. |year=1991 |title=The ecology of a cryptic predator, ''Paleosuchus tigonatus'', in a tropical rainforest |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=41<U+2013>48 |jstor=1564793 }}</ref>

==Behaviour and life history==
The adult smooth-fronted caiman has [[Crypsis|cryptic]] habits and is seldom observed by day because it hides in underwater burrows or may spend much of its time up to {{convert|100|m}} away from water, concealed in dense undergrowth, in hollow logs or under fallen trees.<ref name=Ross/> Males are territorial and females have small [[home range]]s.<ref name=Magnusson1991/>  Adults are semi-terrestrial and mainly feed on such animals as [[porcupine]]s, [[paca]]s, [[snake]]s, [[bird]]s and [[lizard]]s, consuming few fish or molluscs. Hatchlings feed mainly on [[insect]]s in their first few weeks, graduating to larger prey as they grow.<ref name=Ross/> Juvenile mortality is high but adult mortality is low although large [[carnivore]]s such as the [[jaguar]] sometimes prey on them.<ref name=Britton/>

Females become mature and start to breed at about eleven years and males at about twenty.<ref name=Magnusson1991/> The female builds a large mound nest out of leaf litter and earth at the end of the dry season or may use a pre-existing nest. A clutch of ten to fifteen eggs is laid and covered with further nesting material. Some heat is generated by the decaying vegetation and good insulation helps to retain this. The nests are often built against the sides of [[termite mound]]s and metabolic heat generated by the [[termite]]s helps to maintain the [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] at a near constant temperature.<ref name=Ross/> The eggs need to be maintained at a temperature of {{convert|31|to|32|<U+00B0>C}} for the production of male offspring. The [[Egg incubation|incubation period]] is about 115 days and the female caiman remains near the nest for at least the earlier part of this time, providing protection against predators. During incubation, roots may grow through the nest and earth from the termite mound may cement the eggs together. This means that parental assistance is necessary when the eggs hatch to enable the hatchlings to escape from the nest chamber. Having transported the newly emerged juveniles to a nursery area, the female stays with them for a few weeks after which time they disperse. The female may miss a year before breeding again.<ref name=Ross/>

==Status and conservation==
The smooth-fronted caiman is not extensively hunted because its skin contains many bony scutes which make it of little use for tanning. The animals are collected in Guyana however for the [[pet trade]]. The main threats to this species are destruction of its forest habitat and [[pollution]] of its environment by [[gold mining]] activities. It is estimated that there are over one million individuals in the wild<ref name=Britton/> and it is rated by the [[IUCN]] as being of "[[Least Concern]]". It is listed on Appendix II of [[CITES]] which is designed to limit [[overexploitation]] through international trade.<ref name=IUCN/>
