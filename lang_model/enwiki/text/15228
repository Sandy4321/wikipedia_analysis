A '''patch panel''' or '''patch bay''' or '''jackfield''' is a panel, typically [[rackmount]]ed, that houses [[cable]] connections.  One typically shorter [[patch cable]] will plug into the front side, while the back will hold the connection of a much longer and more permanent cable.  The assembly of [[hardware]] is arranged so that a number of [[circuit (telecom)|circuit]]s, usually of the same or similar type, appear on jacks for [[monitoring]], interconnecting, and testing circuits in a convenient, flexible manner.

Patch panels offer the [[convenience]] of allowing technicians to quickly change the path of select [[signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s, without the [[expense]] of dedicated [[switching]] equipment. This was first used by early [[telephone exchanges]], where the [[telephone switchboard]] (a massive array of patch panels) and a large room full of [[telephone operator]]s running it was ubiquitous.

==Uses and connectors==
Patch panels are not only used in [[telephony]] and [[data]], but in other [[sound reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] applications.  Patch bays are used at installations where it is necessary to connect and reconnect various hardware devices, for example at technical control facilities, patch and test facilities, at [[telephone exchange]]s, [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[studio]]s, and [[recording studio]]s.

Patch panels can have any number of different types of [[electrical  connector]]s, often having a different type on the front than the back.  If it has a compound connector on the back and individual ones on the front, it is also a [[breakout box]]. One example is a [[DB25]] connector used for 8-channel [[balanced line]] audio, which is split into eight [[XLR]] or [[TRS connector]]s on the front.

Patch bays facilitate flexibility in the use, [[routing]] or [[circuit restoration|restoration]] of a variety of [[electrical network|circuit]] types, such as dc, VF, group, coaxial, equal-level, and [[digital data]] circuits.  Patch panels accepting industry standard [[keystone modules]] are also available, allowing a variety of connectors to be used on a single panel.

In [[telephony]] and data, the [[66 block]] and [[110 block]] are [[punch block]]s often used as patch panels.  These have [[insulation-displacement connector]]s for quick [[wiring]] of [[wire]]s which have no attached connectors.  Old switchboards used tip-ring (TRS) connectors on the front, still the most common type used now for audio.

While circuits were traditionally connected with short [[patch cords]], in some implementations [[router]]s are now used to make the connections and handle numerous, instantly VT recallable [[configuration]]s.

Patch bays may add expense to the amateur or semi-pro but are an essential feature to  professional installations. While routers are gaining in popularity they are, more often than not, wired with the patch panels as a mechanical backup.

Video patch panels are required for the manual routing of SDI ([[Serial Digital Interface]]), HDTV ([[High Definition]]) or analogue [[L-Band]] at the transmission stage. There are a variety of connectors used for this purpose, some of which are self normalling while others require the use of U-links. They typically present a signal on the top row of connectors with a corresponding receiver on the bottom row. They are wired so in normal use the connection is made top to bottom by either internal wiring or external U-link. The path can be broken or re-routed as required. These panels can also be used for the Dolby 5.1 digital audio signal.

Audio patch panels are wired using the same principles but different signals. The audio signal can be analogue or [[AES/EBU]] (digital). Analogue and AES/EBU can be wired in the same format (using digitally rated cables where required) but three wire balanced systems are a necessity for common mode rejection (hum) in any large/professional analogue installation.

==Normalling==

Patch bays may be half-normal or full-normal, "normal" indicating that the top and bottom jacks are wired together internally.  When a patch bay has half-normal wiring, its switching contacts flow through the bottom jacks of the bottom row while connected to the top row; plugging into the output connection will split the signal.  If a patch bay is wired to full-normal, then it includes switching contacts in both rows of jacks.

==Switches==

Dedicated switching equipment can be an alternative to patch bays in some applications.  Switchers can make  routing as easy as pushing a button, and can provide other benefits over patch bays, including routing a signal to any number of destinations simultaneously.  However, switching equipment that can emulate the capabilities of a given patch bay is much more expensive.  

Example:  a 16-point [[S-Video]] patch panel, with 8 patch cables, may cost $300.00, and connect 8 inputs and 8 outputs.  An S-Video matrix routing switcher with the same capability (8x8) would probably cost between $2,000.00 and $4,000.00 new, though it would probably have more capabilities, including [[audio-follow-video]] and built-in [[distribution amplifier]]s. 

There are various types of switchers for audio and video, from simple [[selector switch]]es to sophisticated  [[production switcher]]s.  However, emulating or exceeding the capabilities of audio and/or video patch bays requires specialized devices like [[routing switcher]]s and [[matrix router]]s (aka "[[crosspoint switcher]]s").  

Like patch panels, switching equipment for nearly any type of signal is available, including analog and digital video and audio, as well as [[radio frequency|RF]] (cable TV), [[MIDI]], telephone, networking, electrical, and just about anything else.

Switching equipment may be electronic, mechanical, or electro-mechanical.  Some switcher hardware can be controlled via computer and/or other external devices.  Some have automated and/or pre-programmed operational capabilities.  There are also software switcher applications used to route signals and control data within a "pure digital" computer environment.

[[Distribution frame]]s are cheaper, but less convenient.
