'''Mezezius''' ({{lang-el|<U+039C><U+03B9><U+03B6><U+03AF><U+03B6><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}), was an Armenian noble who served as a general of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], later usurping the Byzantine throne in [[Sicily]] from [[668]] to [[669]].

According to a letter from Pope [[Gregory II]] to emperor [[Leo III]], he was Count of the ''[[Opsikion]]'', the imperial retinue ({{lang-la|obsequium}}), and a later Syriac chronicle describes him as a ''[[patrikios]]''. After Constans' murder at the baths of Daphne in 668, he was proclaimed emperor by the army thereafter and reigned in Sicily for a few months. However, when the news of the assassination of Constans reached his son [[Constantine IV]] in [[Constantinople]], an expedition was sent to depose and kill him. His court was deported to Constantinople.<ref>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/mezezius.htm Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors]</ref>
