The '''Little Miami Scenic Trail''', also known as the '''Little Miami Bike Trail''', is a [[rail trail]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. As of 2007, it is the second-longest paved trail in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Longest trails: longest paved trail and longest ice skating trail|work=American Trails|publisher=National Trails Training Partnership|date=2007-04-15|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.americantrails.org/resources/info/longest.html}}</ref> Most of the trail runs along a dedicated, car-free corridor maintained by the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]] as '''Little Miami State Park'''. The unusual linear [[state park]] passes though five southwestern counties, running {{convert|70|mi}} long and averaging {{convert|66|ft}} in width for a total of about {{convert|707|acre}}. Over 350,000 people made use of the trail in 2005.<ref name="ODNR full time">{{cite press release|title=Little Miami Scenic Trail Through Terrace Park Now Open Full Time|publisher=Ohio Department of Natural Resources|date=2006-08-25|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://dnr.state.oh.us/news/aug06/0825miamitrail/tabid/14496/Default.aspx}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Little Miami Scenic Trail, Peters Cartridge Factory.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Little Miami Scenic Trail as it approaches the former [[Peters Cartridge Company]] factory in Warren County]]

The largely wooded bike trail was created in 1984,<ref name="Loveland HDR">{{cite web|url=http://www.lovelandoh.com/upload/attachment%20c.doc|title=Amendment and Addition to the City of Loveland Downtown Historic Redevelopment Plan|work=Historic Downtown Loveland Request For Proposals|author=City of Loveland|date=2004-09-28|accessdate=2007-05-28|format=[[DOC (computing)|Word]]}}</ref> along the [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] of the old [[Little Miami Railroad]]. The original trail ran mostly along the eastern bank of the [[Little Miami River]], from [[Spring Valley, Ohio|Spring Valley]] in [[Greene County, Ohio|Greene County]] to the limits of [[Terrace Park, Ohio|Terrace Park]] in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]], across the river from [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]].

The trail was extended northward to [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]] in 1998.<ref name="NTPRD">{{cite web|title=Trails|publisher=National Trail Parks And Recreation District|date=2008-08-19|url=http://www.ntprd.org/trails.htm}}</ref> In 2006, after a protracted battle with Terrace Park residents,<ref name="Enquirer Edwards">{{cite news|title=Trail's happy median sought|author=Jennifer Edwards|first=Jennifer|last=Edwards|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/03/01/loc_loc3terr.html}}</ref> it was extended southward to [[Newtown, Ohio|Newtown]].<ref name="ODNR Avoca">{{cite press release|title=Governor Taft Cuts Ribbon on Little Miami Scenic Trail Extension in Hamilton County|publisher=Ohio Department of Natural Resources|date=2006-06-10|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/jun06/0610lilmiami/tabid/13410/Default.aspx}}</ref>

Recently, state budget cuts have caused portions of the trail to fall into disrepair, resulting in the temporary closure of some [[wooden bridge]]s and [[rest area]]s.<ref name="Enquirer Whitaker">{{cite news|title=Unsafe conditions on bike trail|author=Carrie Whitaker|first=Carrie|last=Whitaker|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|publisher=Gannett Company|date=2008-11-11|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20081111/NEWS01/311110028}}</ref><ref name="DDN McCall">{{cite news|title=Little Miami Scenic Trail needs help from its friends|author=Ken McCall|first=Ken|last=McCall|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=2008-10-31|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/o/content/oh/story/opinions/columns/2008/10/31/ddn103108getout.html}}</ref>

==Current route==
From the Simon Kenton Trailhead ([[Buck Creek Scenic Trail]]) in [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]], the Little Miami Scenic Trail runs southward parallel to [[U.S. Route 42]] and continues to [[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]]. For the first {{convert|9|mi}} to [[Xenia, Ohio|Xenia]], the trail is operated by [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]]'s National Trail Parks and Recreation District.<ref name="NTPRD" /> At [[Xenia Station]], it meets the [[Prairie Grass Trail|Prairie Grass]] and [[Creekside Trail]]s. For the next {{convert|15|mi}} to [[Spring Valley, Ohio|Spring Valley]], the Little Miami trail is managed by [[Greene County, Ohio|Greene County]].

The Little Miami State Park begins at Hedges Road in Spring Valley, quickly meets the banks of the Little Miami River, and follows [[Ohio State Route 47|State Route 47]] into [[Warren County, Ohio|Warren County]]. It passes through [[Corwin, Ohio|Corwin]] (near [[Waynesville, Ohio|Waynesville]]), [[Caesar Creek State Park]], and [[Oregonia, Ohio|Oregonia]]. At [[Fort Ancient (Lebanon, Ohio)|Fort Ancient]], the trail runs under the [[Jeremiah Morrow Bridge]] ([[Interstate 71]]). It then passes through the downtown districts of [[Morrow, Ohio|Morrow]] and [[South Lebanon, Ohio|South Lebanon]] to the former [[Middletown Junction, Ohio|Middletown Junction]], where the [[Lebanon Countryside Trail]] begins.

The Little Miami trail continues southward, opposite the river from [[Kings Mills, Ohio|Kings Mills]] and the rear of the expansive [[Kings Island]] park grounds. At [[Fosters, Ohio|Fosters]], the old [[Peters Cartridge Company]] facility overlooks the bike trail. The trail passes by a few final cornfields before entering [[Clermont County, Ohio|Clermont County]] and downtown [[Loveland, Ohio|Loveland]], where it is known as the [[Loveland Bike Trail]].

At [[Miamiville, Ohio|Miamiville]], the trail crosses to the western, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] side of the Little Miami River, as it meets [[Ohio State Route 126|State Route 126]] ([[Glendale, Ohio|Glendale]]<U+2013>Milford Road). The trail passes by [[Camp Dennison]] and its former southern terminus in [[Milford, Ohio|Milford]]. A 2006 extension carries the Little Miami State Park along [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|U.S. 50]] ([[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]] Pike) to Avoca Park in [[Terrace Park, Ohio|Terrace Park]]. Finally, a short Hamilton County Park District extension leads the trail back across the river to the Little Miami Golf Center in [[Newtown, Ohio|Newtown]].<ref name="ODNR Avoca" />

==Planned extensions==
The Hamilton County Park District intends to extend the Little Miami Scenic Trail to Clear Creek. From there, it will follow the Little Miami River past [[Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport|Lunken Field]] to the river's mouth. At the [[Ohio River]], the trail will meet the [[Ohio River Trail]] and continue westward towards downtown Cincinnati.
