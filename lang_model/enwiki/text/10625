'''Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher'''<!-- NOT "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven" -->, [[Order of the Garter|LG]], [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|OM]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (n<U+00E9>e Roberts; born [[13 October]] [[1925]]) served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] from 1979 to 1990 and leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 1975 until 1990, being the first and to date only woman to hold either post.

Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister was the longest since that of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and was the longest continuous period in office since the tenure of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] who was prime minister in the early 19th century. She was the first woman to lead a major political party in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and the first of only three women to have held any of the four [[great offices of state]]. She currently has a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire, which allows her to sit in the [[House of Lords]].

==Early life and education==
Born Margaret Hilda Roberts, she grew up in the town of [[Grantham, England|Grantham]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]. Her father, [[Alfred Roberts]], owned a grocery shop in the town and was active in local politics and religion, serving as an [[Alderman]] and [[Methodist]] [[lay preacher]]. Roberts came from a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] family but stood&mdash;as was then customary in local government&mdash;as an Independent. He lost his post as Alderman in 1952 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950. He married Beatrice Stephenson, and they had two daughters (Thatcher and her older sister Muriel, 1921-2004).<ref>[[The Sunday Times]], in a 30 October 2006 article by Maurice Chittenden that has been posted on the website of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, reported that the British Labour politician [[Woodrow Wyatt]] strongly believed that Beatrice Roberts's natural father was the Edwardian rake and publisher [[Harry Cust]]. Beatrice's mother, Phoebe Stephenson, was a married servant who worked at Cust's estate, Belton House, which was located near Lady Thatcher's birthplace, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. Cust also was the biological father of the 1920s beauty [[Lady Diana Cooper]], through an affair with the married Duchess of Rutland.</ref> Thatcher was brought up a devout [[Methodist]] and has remained a [[Christian]] throughout her life.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1988thatcher.html Modern History Sourcebook, Excerpts from a speech in which Thatcher discusses her Christian faith in relation to her politics] (Aug 1997) Retrieved [[March 29]], [[2007]]</ref> 
Thatcher performed well academically, attending [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]] and subsequently attending [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1944 to study [[Chemistry]], specifically [[crystallography]]. She became President of the [[Oxford University Conservative Association]] in 1946, the third woman to hold the post. She graduated and then worked as a research chemist for British Xylonite and then [[J. Lyons and Co.]], where she helped develop methods for preserving [[ice cream]]. She was a member of the team that developed the first [[soft ice cream|soft frozen ice cream]]. Thatcher was also a member of the [[Association of Scientific Workers]].

==Political career between 1950 and 1970==

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951]] elections, Margaret Roberts fought the [[safe seat|safe]] Labour seat of [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]], and was at the time the youngest ever female Conservative candidate for office. While active in the Conservative Party in [[Kent]], she met [[Denis Thatcher]], whom she married in 1951. Denis was a wealthy divorced businessman (whose first wife coincidentally had also been named Margaret) and he funded his wife's studies for the [[Barrister|Bar]]. She qualified as a barrister in 1953, the same year that her twin children [[Carol Thatcher|Carol]] and [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]] were born. As a lawyer she specialised in tax law.

Thatcher then began to look for a safe Conservative seat and was narrowly rejected as candidate for [[Orpington (UK Parliament constituency)|Orpington]] in 1954. She had several other rejections before being selected for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in April 1958. She won the seat easily in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 election]] and took her seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Unusually, her [[maiden speech]] was in support of her [[Private Member's Bill]] ([[Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960]]) to force local councils to hold meetings in public, which was successful. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of [[birching]].

She was given early promotion to the front bench as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions|Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]] in September 1961, retaining the post until the Conservatives lost power in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]]. When [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] stepped down Thatcher voted for [[Edward Heath]] in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1965|leadership election]] over [[Reginald Maudling]], and was rewarded with the job of Conservative spokesman on Housing and Land. In this role she adopted the policy of allowing tenants to buy their [[council house]]s, an idea first developed by her colleague [[James Allason]]. The policy would prove popular.<ref>''The Hot Seat'', James Allason, Blackthorn, London 2006</ref> She moved to the Shadow [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] team after 1966.

Thatcher was one of few Conservative MPs to support [[Leo Abse]]'s Bill to decriminalise male [[homosexuality]], and she voted in favour of [[David Steel]]'s Bill to legalise [[abortion]]. She supported retention of [[capital punishment]] and voted against the relaxation of [[divorce]] laws. Thatcher made her mark as a conference speaker in 1966, with a strong attack on the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps "not only towards [[Socialism]], but towards [[Communism]]". She won promotion to the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] as Shadow Fuel Spokesman in 1967, and was then promoted to shadow Transport and, finally, Education before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 election]].

==In Heath's Cabinet==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:MarTha.jpg|frame|Thatcher with [[Edward Heath]]|right]] -->
When the Conservative party under [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, Thatcher became [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. In her first months in office, forced to administer a cut in the Education budget, she was responsible for the abolition of universal free milk for school-children aged seven to eleven (Labour had already abolished it for secondary schools). This provoked a storm of public protest, and led to one of the more unflattering names for her: "Thatcher Thatcher, Milk Snatcher".  However, papers later released under the [[Thirty Year Rule]] show that she spoke against such a move in Cabinet, but was forced, due to the concept of collective responsibility, to implement the will of her fellow ministers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/uk_confidential/1095121.stm BBC News article] [[1 January]] [[2001]]</ref> She also successfully resisted the introduction of library book charges.

Her term was marked by support for several proposals for more local education authorities to close [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]]s and adopt [[comprehensive school|comprehensive secondary education]]; support for this change in education policy was not restricted to the left. Thatcher also saved the [[Open University]] from being abolished. The Chancellor [[Anthony Barber]] actually wanted to abolish it as a budget-cutting measure, for he viewed it as a gimmick by [[Harold Wilson]]. Thatcher believed it was a relatively inexpensive way of extending higher education and insisted that the University should experiment with admitting school-leavers as well as adults. In her memoirs, Thatcher wrote that she was not part of Heath's inner circle, and had little or no influence on the key government decisions outside her department.

After the Conservative defeat in [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]], Heath appointed her Shadow Environment Secretary. In this position she promised to abolish the [[Poll tax#United Kingdom|rating system]] that paid for local government services, which proved a popular policy within the Conservative Party.

==As Leader of the Opposition==
Thatcher agreed with [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] and the [[Centre for Policy Studies|CPS]] that the Heath Government had lost control of [[monetary policy]] <U+2014> and had lost direction <U+2014> following its 1972 [[Flip-flop (politics)|U-turn]]. After her party lost the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|second election of 1974]], Joseph decided to challenge Heath's leadership but later withdrew after an unwise speech seen as supporting [[eugenics]]. Thatcher then decided that she would enter [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|the race]] on behalf of the Josephite/CPS faction. Unexpectedly she out-polled Heath on the first ballot, forcing him to resign the leadership. On the second ballot, she defeated Heath's preferred successor [[William Whitelaw]], by 146 votes to 79, and became Conservative Party leader on [[11 February]] [[1975]].<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102452 Press Conference after winning Conservative leadership (Grand Committee Room)] www.margaretthatcher.org. Retrieved [[2007-09-29]].</ref> She appointed Whitelaw as her deputy. Heath remained disenchanted with Thatcher to the end of his life for what he (and many of his supporters) perceived as her disloyalty in standing against him.

On [[19 January]] [[1976]], she made a speech in [[Kensington]] Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the [[Soviet Union]]. The most famous part of her speech ran:

<blockquote>"The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet ''[[Politburo]]'' do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. [[Guns versus butter model|They put guns before butter]], while we put just about everything before guns." </blockquote>  In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' (''Red Star'') gave her the nickname "[[Iron Lady]]", which was soon publicised by [[Radio Moscow]]. She took delight in the name and it soon became associated with her image as having an unwavering and steadfast character. Her reaction to her other chief nickname, "Attila the Hen" (thought to have been coined by Tory grandee [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Sir Ian Gilmour]]) is unrecorded.

Thatcher appointed many Heath supporters to the Shadow Cabinet, for she had won the leadership as an outsider and had little power base of her own within the party. One, [[James Prior]] got the important brief of shadow Employment Secretary. Thatcher had to act cautiously to convert the Conservative Party to her [[monetarist]] beliefs. She reversed Heath's support for [[devolved government]] for [[Scotland]]. In an interview for [[Granada Television]]'s ''[[World in Action]]'' programme in January 1978, she said "people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture", arousing particular controversy at the time.<ref>TV Interview for Granada World in Action with journalist Gordon Burns(January 27, 1978),[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=103485 ''Rather Swamped''], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref> Critics regarded the comment as a veiled reference to people of colour - and thus pandering to xenophobia and reactionary sentiment. She received 10,000 letters thanking her for raising the subject and the Conservatives gained a lead against Labour in the opinion polls, from both parties at 43% before the speech to 48% for Conservative and 39% for Labour immediately after.<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Grocer's Daughter'' (Jonathan Cape, 2000), p. 400.</ref>

The Labour Government ran into difficulties with the industrial disputes, strikes, increasing unemployment, and collapsing public services during the winter of 1978-9, dubbed the '[[Winter of Discontent]]'. The Conservatives used campaign posters with slogans such as  "Labour Isn't Working"<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/asguru/generalstudies/culture/07advertising/pop07a.shtml BBC News education article]</ref> to attack the government's record over unemployment and its over-regulation of the labour market. [[James Callaghan|James Callaghan's]] Labour government fell after a successful [[Motion of No Confidence]] in spring 1979.

In the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], most opinion polls showed that voters preferred [[James Callaghan]] as Prime Minister even as the Conservative Party maintained a lead in the polls. The Conservatives would go on to win a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons and Margaret Thatcher became the United Kingdom's first female Prime Minister. On arriving at [[10 Downing Street]], she famously said, in a paraphrase of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]]:

{{cquote|Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.}}

==As Prime Minister==

===1979<U+2013>1983===

[[Image:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Thatcher with close ally and friend, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], 1981]]
Thatcher became Prime Minister on [[4 May]], [[1979]], with a mandate to reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce the role of the state in the economy.  Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the [[Civil Service]], that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of [[British Empire|Empire]], and she wanted the country to assert a higher level of influence and leadership in [[international relations|international affairs]]. She became a very close ally, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and politically, with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], elected in 1980 in the [[United States]]. 

In 1981, a number of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] prisoners in [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]] (known in Northern Ireland as 'Long Kesh', its previous official name) went on [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger strike]] to regain the status of [[political prisoners]], which had been revoked five years earlier under the preceding Labour government. [[Bobby Sands]], the first of the strikers, was elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the constituency of [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] a few weeks before he died. Thatcher refused at first to countenance a return to political status for republican prisoners, famously declaring "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm BBC "On This Day", 3 October 1981]</ref> However, after nine more men had starved themselves to death and the strike had ended, some rights relating to political status were restored to paramilitary prisoners. Thatcher's public hard line on the treatment of paramilitaries was reinforced during the 1981 [[Iranian Embassy Siege]] where for the first time in 70 years British armed forces were authorised to use lethal force in Great Britain.

As a [[monetarist]], Thatcher started out in her economic policy by increasing interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thus lower inflation. She had a preference for [[indirect taxation]] over taxes on income, and [[value added tax]] (VAT) was raised sharply to 15%, with a resultant actual short-term rise in inflation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Does VAT lead to inflation? |url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2005/apr/16vat.htm}}</ref> These moves hit businesses <U+2013> especially the manufacturing sector <U+2013> and unemployment quickly passed two million, doubling the one million unemployed under the previous Labour government.

Political commentators harked back to the Heath Government's "U-turn" and speculated that Mrs Thatcher would follow suit, but she repudiated this approach at the 1980 Conservative Party conference, telling the party: ''"To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catch-phrase<U+2014>the U-turn<U+2014>I have only one thing to say: you turn if you want to; the Lady's not for turning."''<ref>[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104431 Margaret Thatcher, Party Conference Speech], October 1980</ref> That she meant what she said was confirmed in the 1981 budget, when, despite concerns expressed in an open letter from 364 leading economists,<ref> Letter to ''[[The Times]]'', [[23 March]] [[1981]]</ref> taxes were increased in the middle of a recession. In January 1982, the inflation rate had dropped back to 8.6% from earlier highs of 18%, and [[interest rate]]s were then allowed to fall. Unemployment continued to rise, reaching an official figure of 3.6 million. By 1983, manufacturing output had dropped 30% from 1978, while overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels since 1970.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/article.asp?ID=1296]</ref><ref>http://eh.net/hmit/ukgdp/</ref>

====The Falklands====
{{main|Falklands War}}
On [[2 April]], [[1982]], a ruling military junta in [[Argentina]] invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], a British [[overseas territory]] that Argentina had [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|claimed]] since an 1830s dispute on their British settlement. Within days Thatcher sent a naval [[task force]] to recapture the islands. Despite the huge logistical difficulties the operation was a success, resulting in a wave of [[patriotism|patriotic]] enthusiasm and support for her government, with ''Newsweek'' declaring "The Empire Strikes Back". There were also several controversies that arose as a result of the Falklands War and Thatcher's handling of the conflict.

====1983 General Election====
The 'Falklands Factor', along with an economic recovery in early 1983, bolstered the government's popularity. The Labour party at this time had split, and there was a new challenge in the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]], formed by an electoral pact between the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. However, this grouping failed to make its intended breakthrough, despite briefly holding an opinion poll lead.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|June 1983 general election]], the Conservatives won 42.4% of the vote, the Labour party 27.6% and the Alliance 25.4% of the vote. Although the Conservatives' share of the vote had fallen slightly (1.5%) since 1979, Labour's vote had fallen by far more (9.3%) and in Britain's [[first past the post]] system, the Conservatives won a [[landslide victory]] even though it had the support of less than 43% of the electorate. This resulted in the Conservative Party having an overall majority of 144 MPs.

===1983<U+2013>1987===
[[Image:MINOR STRIKE SEPT29.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Thatcher became an iconic figure during the UK miners' strike]]
Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the [[trades union]]s. Several unions launched [[strike action|strike]]s in response to legislation introduced to curb their power, but these actions eventually collapsed and gradually, Thatcher's reforms reduced the power and influence of the unions. 

The confrontation over strikes carried out in 1984-85 by the [[National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) in opposition to proposals to close a large number of mines proved decisive. [[Police]] tactics during the strikes came under criticism from [[civil liberties|civil libertarians]],{{Fact|date=February 2007}} but the images of crowds of militant miners attempting to prevent other miners from working proved a shock even to some supporters of the strikes. A group of workers, resigned to the impending failure of the actions and worn down by months of protests, began to defy the Union's rulings, starting splinter groups and advising workers that returning to work was the only viable option. The [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] lasted a full year before the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The Conservative government proceeded to close all but 15 of the country's pits, with the remaining 15 being sold off and privatised in 1994. The defeat of the miners' strike led to a long period of demoralization in the whole of the trade union movement.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

At the end of March 1984, four South Africans were arrested in Coventry, remanded in custody, and charged with contravening the [[United Nations|UN]] arms embargo, which prohibited exports to [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid South Africa]] of military equipment. Mrs Thatcher took a personal interest in the [[Coventry Four]], and [[10 Downing Street]] requested daily summaries of the case from the prosecuting authority, [[HM Customs and Excise]].<ref>[[Richard Norton-Taylor]] and [[David Pallister]], ''Commons test for SA arms row'' ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[December 9]], [[1988]]</ref> Within a month, the Coventry Four had been freed from jail and allowed to travel to South Africa &ndash; on condition that they returned to England for their trial later that year. In April 1984, Thatcher sent senior British diplomat, [[Sir John Leahy]], to negotiate the release of 16 Britons who had been taken hostage by the [[Angola]]n rebel leader, [[Jonas Savimbi]]. At the time, Savimbi's [[UNITA]] guerrilla movement was financed and supported militarily by the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid regime of South Africa]]. On [[26 April]] [[1984]], Leahy succeeded in securing the release of the British hostages at the UNITA base in [[Jamba]], Angola.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EFDF1F38F937A25756C0A962948260 UPI Report, [[New York Times]] May 14, 1984]</ref> In June 1984 Thatcher invited apartheid South Africa's president, [[P. W. Botha]], and foreign minister, [[Pik Botha]], to [[Chequers]] in an effort to stave off growing international pressure for the imposition of [[economic sanctions]] against South Africa, where Britain had invested heavily. She reportedly urged President Botha to end apartheid; to release [[Nelson Mandela]]; to halt the harassment of black dissidents; to stop the bombing of [[African National Congress]] (ANC) bases in front-line states; and to comply with UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from [[Namibia]].<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady'' (Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 324.</ref> However Botha ignored these demands. In an interview with [[Hugo Young]] for ''The Guardian'' in July 1986, Thatcher expressed her belief that economic sanctions against South Africa would be immoral because they would make thousands of black workers unemployed.<ref>Hugo Young, ''Supping with the Devils'' (Atlantic, 2003), p.6.</ref> In August 1984, foreign minister, Pik Botha, decided not to allow the Coventry Four to return to stand trial, thereby forfeiting <U+00A3>200,000 bail money put up by the South African embassy in London. The Coventry Four affair, and Mrs Thatcher's alleged involvement in it, would hit the headlines four years later when British diplomat, [[Patrick Haseldine]], wrote a letter to the Guardian newspaper on [[7 December]] [[1988]].<ref>[[Talk:Coventry Four/Archive 1|'Fifth man' professor identified in South African weapons ring]]</ref>

On the early morning of [[12 October]] [[1984]], the day before her 59th birthday, Thatcher escaped injury in the [[Brighton hotel bombing]] during the Conservative Party Conference when her hotel room was bombed by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. Five people died in the attack. A prominent member of the Cabinet, [[Norman Tebbit]], was injured, and his wife Margaret was left paralysed. Thatcher herself would have been injured if not for the fact that she was delayed from using the bathroom (which suffered more damage than the room she was in at the time the IRA bomb detonated). Thatcher insisted that the conference open on time the next day and made her speech as planned in defiance of the bombers, a gesture which won widespread approval across the political spectrum.<ref>Extract from Margaret Thatcher The Downing Street Years, pp379-83(1993), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109119 ''Northern Ireland: The Brighton Bomb [memoirs extract]''], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref>

On [[15 November]] [[1985]], Thatcher signed the Hillsborough [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] with Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Garret FitzGerald]], the first time a British government gave the Republic of Ireland a say (albeit advisory) in the governance of Northern Ireland. The agreement was greeted with fury by Northern Irish unionists. 

Thatcher's political and economic philosophy emphasised reduced state intervention, [[free market]]s, and [[entrepreneur]]ialism. After the 1983 election, the Government sold off most of the large utilities, starting with [[British Telecom]], which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many people took advantage of [[stock|share]] offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit and therefore the proportion of shares held by individuals rather than institutions did not increase. The policy of [[Privatization|privatisation]], while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with [[Thatcherism]]. Wider share-ownership and council house sales became known as "[[popular capitalism]]" to its supporters (a term coined by [[John Redwood]]). 

In the [[Cold War]], Mrs Thatcher supported [[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policies of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] against the Soviets. This contrasted with the policy of ''[[d<U+00E9>tente]]'' which the West had pursued during the 1970s, and caused friction with allies who still adhered to the idea of ''d<U+00E9>tente''. [[United States|US]] forces were permitted by Mrs. Thatcher to station nuclear [[cruise missile]]s at British bases, arousing mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. However, she later was the first Western leader to respond warmly to the rise of the future reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], declaring that she liked him and describing him as "a man we can do business with" after a meeting in 1984, three months before he came to power. This was a start of a move by the West back to a new ''d<U+00E9>tente'' with the USSR under Gorbachev's leadership, which coincided with the final erosion of Soviet power prior to its eventual collapse in 1991. Thatcher outlasted the Cold War, which ended in 1989, and those who share her views on it credit her with a part in the West's victory, by both the deterrence and ''d<U+00E9>tente'' postures.

In 1985, as a deliberate snub, the [[University of Oxford]] voted to refuse her an honorary degree in protest against her cuts in funding for higher education. <ref>BBC News "On this day archive" [[29 January]] [[1985]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/low/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm ''Thatcher snubbed by Oxford dons''], ''BBC News''. Retrieved [[April 9]] [[2007]].</ref> This award had always previously been given to all Prime Ministers who had been educated at Oxford.

Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] when she acted with colleagues to allow the helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Aircraft|Westland]], a vital defence contractor, to refuse to link with the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in order for it to link with the management's preferred option, [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] of the United States. [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Michael Heseltine]], who had pushed the Agusta deal, resigned in protest after this, and remained an influential critic and potential leadership challenger. He would eventually prove instrumental in Thatcher's fall in 1990.

In 1986, her government controversially abolished the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC), then led by the strongly left-wing [[Ken Livingstone]], and six [[metropolitan county|Metropolitan County Councils]] (MCCs). The government claimed this was an efficiency measure. However, Thatcher's opponents held that the move was politically motivated, as all of the abolished councils were controlled by Labour, had become powerful centres of opposition to her government, and were in favour of higher local government taxes and public spending. Several of them had however rendered themselves politically vulnerable by committing scarce public funds to causes widely seen as political and even extreme. {{Specify|date=December 2006}} {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Thatcher had two notable foreign policy successes in her second term.
*In 1984, she visited China and signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] with [[Deng Xiaoping]] on [[19 December]], which committed the [[People's Republic of China]] to award [[Hong Kong]] the status of a "Special Administrative Region". Under the terms of the [[One Country, Two Systems]] agreement, China was obliged to leave Hong Kong's economic status unchanged after the handover on [[1 July]] [[1997]] for a period of fifty years &ndash; until 2047.
*At the Dublin European Council in November 1979, Mrs Thatcher argued that the United Kingdom paid far more to the [[European Economic Community]] than it received in spending. She famously declared at the summit: "We are not asking the Community or anyone else for money. We are simply asking to have our own money back". Her arguments were successful and at the June 1984 [[Fontainebleau]] Summit, the EEC agreed on an annual rebate for the United Kingdom, amounting to 66% of the difference between Britain's EU contributions and receipts. This still remains in effect, although [[Tony Blair]] later agreed to significantly reduce the size of the rebate. It periodically causes political controversy among the members of the [[European Union]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===1987<U+2013>1990===
By leading her party to victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] with a 101 seat majority, riding an economic boom against a weak Labour opposition advocating unilateral nuclear disarmament, Margaret Thatcher became the longest continuously serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom since [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] (1812 to 1827). Most [[United Kingdom newspapers]] supported her&mdash;with the exception of ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''&mdash;and were rewarded with regular press briefings by her press secretary, [[Bernard Ingham]]. She was known as "Maggie" in the [[tabloid]]s, and her opponents on their marches were given to chanting the slogan "[[Maggie Out]]!" Her unpopularity on the left is evident from the lyrics of several contemporary pop-music songs.

Though an early backer of decriminalization of male homosexuality (see above), Thatcher, at the 1987 Conservative party conference, issued the statement that "Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay". Backbench Conservative MPs and Peers had already begun a backlash against the 'promotion' of homosexuality and, in December 1987, the controversial '[[Section 28]]' was added as an amendment to what became the [[Local Government Act 1988]]. This legislation has since been abolished by Tony Blair's Labour administration.

Thatcher, the former chemist, became publicly concerned with environmental issues in the late 1980s. In 1988, she made a major speech <ref>Speech to the Royal Society(September 27, 1988), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref> accepting the problems of [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[acid rain]]. 

At [[Bruges, Belgium]], in 1988, Thatcher made a speech in which she outlined her opposition to proposals from the [[European Union|European Community]] for a federal structure and increasing centralisation of decision-making. Although she had supported British membership, Thatcher believed that the role of the EC should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that new EC regulations would reverse the changes she was making in the UK: "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels". She was specifically against [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], through which a single currency would replace national currencies, and for which the EC was making preparations, now known as the [[euro]] and in force as legal tender since 2002 in twelve European countries. Britain has so far remained outside the so-called [[eurozone]]. The speech caused an outcry from other European leaders, and exposed for the first time the deep split that was emerging over European policy inside her Conservative Party.

Thatcher's popularity once again declined, in 1989, as the economy suffered from high interest rates. She blamed her Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], who had been following an economic policy which was a preparation for monetary union; in an interview for the ''Financial Times'', in November 1987, Thatcher claimed not to have been told of this and did not approve.<ref>Interview for Financial Times with journalists Malcolm Rutherford, Geoffrey Owen, and Peter Riddell(November 20, 1987), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969 ''Thatcher stands firm against full EMS role''], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref>

At a meeting before the [[Madrid]] European Community summit in June 1989, Lawson and Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] forced Thatcher to agree to the circumstances under which she would join the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a preparation for monetary union and the abolition of the [[Pound Sterling]]. At the meeting, they both claimed they would resign if their demands were not met.<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 712.</ref> Thatcher responded by demoting Howe and by listening more to her adviser Sir [[Alan Walters]] on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.

That November, Thatcher was [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1989|challenged for the leadership]] of the Conservative Party by Sir [[Anthony Meyer]]. As Meyer was a virtually unknown [[backbencher|backbench]] MP, he was viewed as a "[[stalking horse]]" candidate for more prominent members of the party. Thatcher easily defeated Meyer's challenge, but there were sixty ballot papers either cast for Meyer or abstaining, a surprisingly large number for a sitting Prime Minister. Her supporters in the Party, however, viewed the results as a success, claiming that after ten years as Prime Minister and with approximately 370 Conservative MPs voting, the opposition was surprisingly small.<ref>BBC News "On this day archive" [[5 December]] [[1989]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm ''Thatcher beats off leadership rival''], ''BBC News''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref>

Thatcher's new system to replace local government taxes, outlined in the Conservative manifesto for the 1987 election, was introduced in [[Scotland]] in 1989 and in [[England]] and [[Wales]] in 1990. The rates were replaced by the [[Community Charge]] (more widely known as the "poll tax"), which applied the same amount to every individual resident, with discounts for low earners. This was to be the most universally unpopular policy of her premiership and had the effect of limiting the number of people on the electoral register.

Additional problems emerged when many of the tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than predicted. Opponents of the Community Charge banded together to resist [[bailiff]]s and disrupt [[court]] hearings of Community Charge [[debt]]ors. The Labour MP, [[Terry Fields]], was jailed for 60 days for refusing on principle to pay his Community Charge. As the Prime Minister continued to refuse to compromise on the tax and as many as one in five people had still not paid, unrest mounted and culminated in a number of [[Poll tax Riots|riots]]. The most serious of these happened in London on [[31 March]] [[1990]], during a protest at [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], which more than 100,000 protesters attended. The huge unpopularity of the tax was seen as a major factor in Thatcher's downfall.<ref>BBC News "On this day archive" [[31 March]] [[1990]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm ''Violence flares in poll tax demonstration''], ''BBC News''. Retreived [[October 3]], [[2007]].</ref>

One of Thatcher's final acts in office was to put pressure on US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to deploy troops to the [[Middle East]] to drive [[Saddam Hussein]]'s army out of [[Kuwait]]. Bush was somewhat apprehensive about the plan, but Thatcher's memoirs summarise her advice to him during a telephone conversation with the words, "this was no time to go wobbly!" <ref>Margaret Thatcher The Downing Street Years , pp.823-24(August 26, 1990), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110711 ''Gulf War: Bush-Thatcher phone conversation (no time to go wobbly) [memoirs extract]''], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[June 25]], [[2007]].</ref>

On the Friday before the Conservative Party conference in October 1990, Thatcher ordered her new [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[John Major]] to reduce interest rates by 1%. Major persuaded her that the only way to maintain monetary stability was to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism at the same time, despite not meeting the 'Madrid conditions'. The Conservative Party conference that year saw a large degree of unity; few who attended could have imagined that Mrs Thatcher had only a matter of weeks left in office.

===Fall from power===
{{seealso|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990}}

Thatcher's political "assassination" was, according to witnesses such as [[Alan Clark]], one of the most dramatic episodes in British political history. The idea of a long-serving prime minister <U+2014> undefeated at the polls <U+2014> being ousted by an internal party ballot might at first sight seem bizarre. However, by 1990, opposition to Thatcher's policies on local government taxation (the regressive poll tax, or [[community charge]]) <ref name=POLL>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm ''1990: Violence flares in poll tax demonstration'' BBC News 31/03/1990]</ref>, her Government's perceived mishandling of the economy (in particular the high [[interest rates]] of 15% that eroded her support among home owners and business people), and the divisions opening in the Conservative Party over [[European integration]] made her seem increasingly politically vulnerable and her party increasingly divided. Her distaste for ''consensus politics'' and willingness to override colleagues' opinions, including that of Cabinet, emboldened the backlash against her when it did occur.<ref>Foster, C, British Government in Crisis, Hart Publishing, 2005</ref>Others cited her strong uncompromising personality. The dislike for Thatcher that had previously come primarily from her political opponents was now being expressed by some members of her own party.

On [[1 November]] [[1990]], [[Geoffrey Howe|Sir Geoffrey Howe]], one of Thatcher's oldest and staunchest supporters, resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister in protest at Thatcher's European policy. In his resignation speech in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] two weeks later, he suggested that the time had come for "others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties" with which he stated that he had wrestled for perhaps too long. Her former cabinet colleague Michael Heseltine subsequently challenged her for the leadership of the party, and attracted sufficient support in the first round of voting to prolong the contest to a second ballot. Though she initially stated that she intended to contest the second ballot, Thatcher decided, after consulting with her Cabinet colleagues, to withdraw from the contest. On [[22 November]], at just after 9.30 a.m., she announced to the Cabinet that she would not be a candidate in the second ballot. Shortly afterwards, her staff made public what was, in effect, her resignation statement:

{{cquote|Having consulted widely among my colleagues, I have concluded that the unity of the Party and the prospects of victory in a General Election would be better served if I stood down to enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership. I should like to thank all those in Cabinet and outside who have given me such dedicated support.}}
[[Neil Kinnock]], Leader of the Opposition, proposed a motion of no confidence in the government, and Margaret Thatcher seized the opportunity this presented on the day of her resignation to deliver one of her most memorable performances:

{{cquote|...a single currency is about the politics of Europe, it is about a federal Europe by the back door. So I shall consider the proposal of the Honourable Member for Bolsover ([[Dennis Skinner|Mr. Skinner]]). Now where were we? ''I am enjoying this''."}}
She supported [[John Major]] as her successor and he duly won the leadership contest, although in the years to come her approval of Major would fall away. After her resignation a [[MORI]] poll found that 52% agreed with the [[proposition]]  that "On balance she had been good for the country", while 48% disagreed thinking she had been bad.<ref>Dennis Kavangah, ''The Reordering of British Politics: Politics after Thatcher'' (OUP, 1997), p. 134.</ref> In 1991, she was given a long and unprecedented standing ovation at the party's annual conference, although she politely rejected calls from delegates for her to make a speech.  She did, however, occasionally speak in the House of Commons after she was Prime Minister. She retired from the House at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], at the age of 66 years. Her continued presence in the House of Commons after the resignation was thought to be a destabilising influence on the Conservative government.

In 1992, Margaret Thatcher was raised to the House of Lords by the conferment of a [[life peerage]] as '''Baroness Thatcher''', of [[Kesteven]] in the County of Lincolnshire. She did not take an hereditary title, as she had recommended for [[Harold Macmillan]], later Earl of Stockton, on his ninetieth birthday in 1984. By virtue of the life barony, she entered the [[House of Lords]]. She made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the [[Maastricht Treaty]], describing it as "a treaty too far" and in June 1993 told the Lords: "I could never have signed this treaty".<ref>House of Lords European Communities (Amendment) Bill Speech(June 7, 1993), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108314 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref> She had also advocated a referendum on the treaty when she returned to the back benches in 1991.  She cited [[A. V. Dicey]], to the effect that, since all three main parties were in favour of revisiting the treaty, the people should have their say.<ref>House of Commons European Community debate(November 20, 1991), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108291 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''.

In August 1992, she called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on [[Gorazde]] and [[Sarajevo]] in order to end [[ethnic cleansing]] and to preserve the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n state. She claimed what was happening in Bosnia was "reminiscent of the worst excesses of the [[Nazi]]s".<ref>{{wikiref |id=Campbell-2003 |text=Campbell, ''The Iron Lady'', p. 769}}</ref> In December of that same year she warned that there could be a "holocaust" in Bosnia and, after the [[Srebrenica massacre#1992 ethnic cleansing campaign|first massacre]] at [[Srebrenica]] in April 1993, Thatcher thought it was a "killing field the like of which I thought we would never see in Europe again". She reportedly said to Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary: "Douglas, Douglas, you would make [[Neville Chamberlain]] look like a warmonger".<ref>{{wikiref |id=Campbell-2003 |text=Campbell, ''The Iron Lady'', p. 770}}</ref>

Margaret Thatcher had already been honoured by the Queen in 1990, shortly after her resignation as Prime Minister, when awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]], one of the UK's highest distinctions. In addition, her husband, Denis Thatcher, had been given a [[baronet]]cy in 1991 (ensuring that their son [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]] would inherit a title). This was the first creation of a baronetcy since 1965. In 1995, Thatcher was raised to the [[Order of the Garter]], the United Kingdom's highest order of [[Chivalry]].

In July 1992, she was hired by tobacco company [[Philip Morris|Philip Morris Companies]], now the [[Altria|Altria Group]], as a "geopolitical consultant" for US$250,000 per year and an annual contribution of US$250,000 to her Foundation.

From 1993 to 2000, she served as Chancellor of the [[College of William and Mary]], Virginia, USA, which was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1693. She was also Chancellor of the [[University of Buckingham]], the UK's only private university. She retired from the post in 1998.

She wrote her [[memoir]]s in two volumes, ''The Path to Power'' and ''The Downing Street Years''. In 1993 ''The Downing Street Years'' were turned into a documentary series by the BBC, in which she described the Cabinet rebellion that brought about her resignation as "treachery with a smile on its face".

Although she remained supportive in public, in private she made her displeasure with many of John Major's policies plain, and her views were conveyed to the press and widely reported. She was critical of the rise in public spending under Major, his tax increases, and his support of the [[European Union]]. After [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|election as Labour Party leader]] in 1994, Thatcher gave an interview in May 1995 in which she praised Blair as "probably the most formidable Labour leader since [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. I see a lot of [[socialism]] behind their front bench, but not in Mr Blair. I think he genuinely has moved".<ref>http://www.fifthinternational.org/index.php?id=50,201,0,0,1,0 </ref>

In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1997|Conservative leadership election]] in the aftermath of the Conservatives' [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|landslide defeat]] at the hands of [[New Labour]], Thatcher voiced her support for [[William Hague]] after [[Kenneth Clarke]] entered into an alliance with [[John Redwood]]. Thatcher reportedly then toured the tea room of the House of Commons, urging Conservative MPs to vote for Hague.

In 1998, Thatcher made an unofficial visit to the former [[Chile]]an president [[Augusto Pinochet]], while he was under house arrest in [[Surrey]]. Pinochet was fighting extradition for [[human rights]] abuses committed during his tenure. Thatcher expressed her support and friendship for Pinochet.<ref>BBC News Report [[26 March]] [[1999]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/304516.stm ''Thatcher stands by Pinochet''], ''BBC News''. Retrieved [[April 9]], [[2007]].</ref> Pinochet had been a key ally of Britain during the [[Falklands War]]. Also in 1998, she made a <U+00A3>2,000,000 donation to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] for the endowment of a Margaret Thatcher Chair in Entrepreneurial Studies. She also donated the archive of her personal papers to [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] where the collection continues to be expanded.

Margaret Thatcher actively supported the Conservative general election campaign in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]. In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|Conservative leadership election]] shortly after, Lady Thatcher came out in support of [[Iain Duncan Smith]] because she believed he would "make infinitely the better leader" than Kenneth Clarke due to Clarke's "old-fashioned views of the role of the state and his unbounded enthusiasm for European integration".<ref>Letter supporting Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership published in the ''Daily Telegraph'' (August 21, 2001), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390 Public Statement, Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''.

In 2002, she published ''Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World'' detailing her thoughts on [[international relations]] since her resignation in 1990. The chapters on the European Union were particularly controversial; she called for a fundamental renegotiation of Britain's membership to preserve the UK's sovereignty and, if that failed, for Britain to leave and join [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]. These chapters were serialised in ''The Times'' on Monday, [[18 March]] and caused a political furore for the rest of the week until Friday, [[22 March]] when it was announced she had been advised by her doctors to make no more public speeches on health grounds, having suffered several small strokes.<ref> Statement on Margaret Thatcher's health as she abandons public speaking (March 22, 2002), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109305 ''Statement from the office off the RT Hon.

She remains active in various groups, including [[Conservative Way Forward]], the [[Bruges Group]] and the [[European Foundation (think tank)|European Foundation]]. She was [[Dennis Thatcher|widowed]] on [[26 June]] [[2003]].

On [[11 June]] [[2004]], Thatcher attended the funeral of, and delivered a tribute via videotape to, former United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] at his [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|state funeral]] at the National Cathedral in [[Washington, D.C.]] In view of her failing mental faculties following several small strokes, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier. Thatcher then flew to [[California]] with the Reagan entourage, and attended the memorial service and interment ceremony for President Reagan at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]].

In December 2004, it was reported that Thatcher had told a private meeting of Conservative MPs that she was against the British Government's plan to introduce [[British national identity card|identity cards]].

On [[13 October]] [[2005]], Thatcher marked her 80th birthday with a party at the [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] where the guests included [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], and [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy]]. There, Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe of Aberavon, commented on her political career: "Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible."

In September 2006, Thatcher attended the official [[Washington, D.C.]] memorial service marking the 5th anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th terror attacks]] . She attended as a guest of the U.S. Vice President, [[Dick Cheney]], and met with U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] during her visit. It marked her first visit to the United States since the funeral for former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] in April 2006.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060908/wl_uk_afp/usattacks5years </ref>

On [[12 November]] [[2006]], she appeared at the [[Remembrance Day]] parade at the [[Cenotaph]] in London, leaning heavily on the arm of former Prime Minister, [[John Major]]. One week later, she released an effusive statement of condolence on the death of her friend and economic mentor, [[Milton Friedman]], the man often described as the inspiration behind [[Thatcherism]].

On [[21 February]] [[2007]] as a statue of her was unveiled in the UK Parliament, Lady Thatcher made a rare and brief speech in the members' lobby of the House of Commons.

[[Image:NRMARGARETTHATCHER.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Former U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] awards the [[Ronald Reagan Freedom Award]] to Thatcher in 1998.]]

Thatcher may be remembered most of all for her remark "There is no such thing as society" <ref>Full text of Margaret Thatcher's quotation to ''Women's Own'' magazine, [[31 October]], [[1987]], quoted in [http://briandeer.com/social/thatcher-society.htm ''Epitaph for the eighties? <nowiki>'there is no such thing as society'</nowiki>''], briandeer.com, undated, Retrieved [[10 April]] [[2007]]</ref> to the reporter Douglas Keay, for ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine, [[23 September]] [[1987]]. This remark has frequently been quoted out of its full context and the surrounding remarks were as follows:

<blockquote>"I think we've been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it's the government's job to cope with it. 'I have a problem, I'll get a grant.' 'I'm homeless, the government must house me.' They're casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first."<ref>Interview for Woman's Own("no such thing as society") with journalist Douglas Keay(September 23, 1987), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689 ''"Aids, education and the year 2000!"''], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved [[April 10]], [[2007]].</ref></blockquote>

In 1996, the [[Scott Inquiry]] into the [[Arms-to-Iraq]] affair investigated the Thatcher government's record in dealing with [[Saddam Hussein]]. It revealed how <U+00A3>1bn of Whitehall money was used in soft loan guarantees for British exporters to [[Iraq]]. The judge found that during Baghdad's protracted [[Iran-Iraq war|invasion of Iran in the 1980s]], officials destroyed documents relating to the export of [[Chieftain tank]] parts to [[Jordan]] which ended up in Iraq. Ministers clandestinely relaxed official guidelines to help private companies sell machine tools which were used in munitions factories. The British company [[Racal]] exported sophisticated [[Jaguar V]] radios to the former Iraqi dictator's army on credit. Members of the Conservative cabinet refused to stop lending guaranteed funds to Saddam even after he executed a British journalist, [[Farzad Bazoft]], Thatcher<U+2019>s cabinet minuting that they did not want to damage British industry.

[[New Labour]] and [[Blairism]] have incorporated much of the economic, social and political tenets of "Thatcherism" in the same manner as, in a previous era, the Conservative Party from the 1950s until the days of [[Edward Heath]] accepted many of the basic assumptions of the [[welfare state]] instituted by Labour governments. The curtailing and large-scale dismantling of elements of the welfare state under Thatcher have largely remained.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} As well, Thatcher's program of [[privatization|privatising]] [[nationalisation|state-owned enterprises]] has not been reversed. Indeed, successive Tory and Labour governments have further curtailed the involvement of the state in the economy and have further dismantled public ownership.

Thatcher's impact on the [[trade union]] movement in Britain has been lasting, with the breaking of the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|miners' strike of 1984-1985]] seen as a watershed moment, or even a breaking point, for a union movement which has been unable to regain the degree of political power it exercised up through the 1970s. Unionisation rates in Britain have permanently declined since the 1980s, and the legislative instruments introduced to curtail the impact of strikes have not been reversed. The Labour Party has worked to loosen its ties to the trade union movement {{Fact|date=September 2007}}.  Although the power of trade unions is still significantly lower than it was before Thatcher came to power, the [[Employment Relations Act 2004]] was introduced under the Blair government to make statutory recognition of trade unions accessible and to further protect workers taking industrial action.

Thatcher's legacy has continued to strongly influence the Conservative Party itself. Successive leaders, starting with [[John Major]], and continuing in opposition with [[William Hague]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Michael Howard]], have struggled with real or perceived factions in the Parliamentary and national party to determine what parts of her heritage should be retained or jettisoned. One cannot yet determine what the role of Thatcherism will be under the leadership of [[David Cameron]].

Thatcher is credited by Ronald Reagan with persuading him that Mikhail Gorbachev was sincere in his desire to reform and liberalize the Soviet Union. The resulting thaw in East-West relations helped to end the [[Cold War]]. In recognition of this, Lady Thatcher was awarded the 1998 [[Ronald Reagan Freedom Award]] by [[Nancy Reagan|Mrs. Nancy Reagan]]. The award is only given to those who "have made monumental and lasting contributions to the cause of freedom worldwide," and "embody President Reagan's life long belief that one man or woman can truly make a difference."
