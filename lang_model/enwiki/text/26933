'''Robert Esmie''' (born July 5, 1972) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]], winner of the gold medal in the 4x100 [[Metre|m]] [[Relay race|relay]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].

Born in [[Jamaica]] and raised in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Esmie formed along with [[Glenroy Gilbert]], [[Bruny Surin]] and [[Donovan Bailey]] the world's best 4x100 m relay team in the mid-1990s.

Esmie placed seventh (10.23) in the second semi-final of the 100m and won a bronze medal in 4x100 m relay at the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|1993 World Championships]]. At the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]], Esmie won the gold medal in 4x100 m relay.

In 1995, Esmie won a bronze medal in 60 m at the World Indoor Championships and was again a member of gold medal winning Canadian 4x100 m relay team at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics|1995 World Championships]].

At the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], the Canadian relay team weren't the favourites. Although they had won almost all the titles available during the last couple of years, they were earned in the absence of the [[United States]]. However at the Olympics 4x100 m relay final, the Canadian team beat United States by almost half a second, to establish itself as the best relay team in the world. Esmie was not originally slated to run with the relay team in Atlanta, but replaced [[Carlton Chambers]] the night before the race.  

Esmie and the Canadian team won a gold medal again at the [[1997 World Championships in Athletics|1997 World Championships]].

In 2008 he was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] as part of the 1996 Summer Olympics 4x100 relay team.<ref>{{cite web
