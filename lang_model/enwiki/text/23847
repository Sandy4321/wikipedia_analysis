It is bordered by [[Sudan]] in the west, [[Ethiopia]] in the south, and [[Djibouti]] in the southeast. The east and northeast of the country have an extensive coastline on the [[Red Sea]], directly across from [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and several of the [[Hanish Islands]] are part of Eritrea. Its size is just under 118,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2> with an estimated population of	4,400,000. The capital is Asmara.

Italy conquered Eritrea and the [[Italy|Italian]] government formally consolidated it into a [[colony]] on January 1, 1890. In 1936 it became a province of [[Italian East Africa]] (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. The British expelled the Italians in 1941<ref>[http://www.statoids.com/uer.html Eritrea Regions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and continued to administer the territory under a [[UN]] [[mandate]] until 1951 when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia as per UN resolution 390(A) adopted in December 1950.

Increasing unrest and resistance in Eritrea against the federation with Ethiopia eventually led to a decision by the Ethiopian government to annex Eritrea as its 14th province in 1962.  An Eritrean independence movement formed in the early 1960s which later erupted into a 31-year long [[war]] against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991. Following a UN supervised referendum in Eritrea dubbed [[UNOVER]] in which the Eritrean people overwhelmingly voted for independence from Ethiopia, Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993.<ref name="Britannica_Eritrea-page20">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-37675/Eritrea |title=Eritrea <U+2013> The spreading revolution |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Article |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> Eritrea is a single-party state - whilst its constitution, adopted in 1997, stipulates that the state is a presidential republic with a [[unicameral]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], it has yet to be implemented.

==Pre-History==

One of the oldest hominids, representing a possible link between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and an archaic ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was found in Buya (Eritrean Danakil) in 1995 by [[Italy|Italian]] scientists. The cranium was dated to over 1 million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abbate, Ernesto; Albianelli, Andrea; Azzaroli, Augusto; Benvenuti, Marco; Tesfamariam, Berhane;

The site contained obsidian tools dated to the [[paleolithic]] era, over 125,000 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exn.ca/hominids/outofafrica.cfm |accessdate = 2006-10-02 |title=Out of Africa |date=[[1999-09-10]]}}</ref> [[Epipaleolithic]] or [[mesolithic]] cave paintings in central and northern Eritrea attest to early hunter-gatherers in this region. A US [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[William Sanders]] of the [[University of Michigan]], also discovered a possible missing link between ancient and modern elephants in the form of the fossilized remains of a pig-sized creature in Eritrea. The fossil which is 27 million years old pushes the origins of elephants and mastodons five million years further into the past and asserts that modern elephants originated in Africa.

==Pre-colonial civilization==

The oldest written reference to the territory now known as Eritrea is the chronicled expedition launched to the fabled ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or ''Ta Netjeru'', meaning land of the Gods) by the [[Ancient Egyptians]] in the twenty-fifth century&nbsp;BC under [[Pharaoh]] [[Sahure]]. Later sources from the Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] in the fifteenth century&nbsp;BC present a more detailed portrayal of an expedition in search of [[frankincense]]. The geographical location of the missions to Punt is described as roughly corresponding to the southern west coast of the [[Red Sea]].  The name Eritrea is a rendition of the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] name <U+0395><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03B8><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03B1>, ''Erythra<U+00ED>a'', the "Red Land" The earliest evidence of [[agriculture]], [[Urban area|urban]] settlement and trade in Eritrea was found in the western region of the country consisting of archeological remains dating back to 3500 BC in sites called the ''Gash group''. Based on the archaeological evidence, there seems to have been a connection between the peoples of the Gash group and the civilizations of the [[Nile Valley]] namely [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]].<ref name="urbanism">{{cite paper |author=Fattovich, Rodolfo |title=The development of urbanism in the northern Horn of Africa in ancient and medieval times |url=http://hometown.aol.com/_ht_a/skipbdahlgren/sdahlgren/fattowich.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref>

In the highlands, in the capital city [[Asmara]]'s suburbs, scores of ancient sites have been documented, including Sembel, Mai Chiot, Ona Gudo, Mai Temenai, Weki Duba, and Mai Hutsa. Mostly dating to the early and mid-1st millennium BCE (800 to 350 BCE), these communities consisted of small towns, villages, and hamlets built of stone. The proximity of these ancient communities to gold mines suggest that part of their prosperity was linked to the mining and processing of gold. Around the mid-1st millennium, several sites with [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] remains (inscriptions, artifacts, monuments, etc.) seem to emerge in the central highlands, for example, at Keskese. <ref> Peter Schmidt, Matthew Curtis, and Zelalem Teka, The Ancient Ona Communities of the First Millennium BCE: Urban Precursors and Independent Development on the Asmara Plateau.

It grew during the fourth century&nbsp;BC and came into prominence during the first century&nbsp;AD, [[Aksumite currency|minting its own coins]] by the third century, and converting in the fourth century to [[Christianity]], thereby becoming the second official Christian state (after Armenia), and the first country to feature the cross on its coins. According to [[Mani]], it grew to be one of the four greatest civilizations in the world, on a par with [[History of China|China]], [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], and [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. In the seventh century, with the advent of [[Islam]] across the Red Sea in [[Arabia]] and the Arab invasion and subsequent destruction of Adulis, Aksum's trade and power on the Red Sea began to decline and the empire gradually diminished and was overtaken by smaller rival kingdoms.

During the medieval period, contemporary with and following the gradual disintegration of the Aksumite state between the 9th and 10th centuries, several states as well as tribal and clan lands emerged in the area known today as Eritrea. Between the eighth and thirteenth century, northern and northwestern Eritrea had largely come under the domination of the [[Beja]], a [[Cushitic]] people from northeastern [[Sudan]].<ref>''http://american.edu/ted/ice/eritrea.htm''</ref> The Beja brought Islam to large parts of Eritrea and connected the region to the greater [[Islamic]] world. Christians of the Axumite era continued nonetheless to inhabit these areas and retain their religion. In the main highland area and adjacent coastline of what were previously Moslem (Beja) ruled areas, a Christian Kingdom called ''Midir Bahr'' or ''Midri Bahri'' (Tigrinya for land of the sea) arose, ruled by the  [[Bahr negus]] or ''Bahr negash'', ("ruler of the sea") emerged in the 15th century.<ref>Daniel Kendie, ''The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict 1941 <U+2013> 2004: Deciphering the Geo-Political Puzzle'' (United States of America:  Signature Book Printing, 2005), pp. 17-8.</ref> The southeastern parts of Eritrea, inhabited by the independent [[Afar people|Afar]] since ancient times, came to form part of the Islamic [[Adal Sultanate|sultanate of Adal]] in the early 13th century. Parts of the southwestern lowlands of Eritrea were under the dominion of the then Christian/animist [[Funj sultanate of Sinnar]]. 

An invading force of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], conquered [[Massawa]] in 1557 from the Christians, building what is now considered the "old town" of Massawa on Batsi island.  They also conquered the towns of [[Arkiko|Hergigo]], and [[Debarwa]], the capital city of the contemporary Christian [[Bahr negus]] (ruler), [[Bahr negus Yeshaq|Yeshaq]] before being repulsed back to the coast by 1578. The Ottomans remained in control of the important ports of [[Massawa]] and [[Arkiko|Hergigo]] and their environs, and maintained their dominion over the coastal areas for nearly 300 years, absorbing the coastal areas of the disintegrated Adal sultanate as vassals in the 16th century. The Funj sultanate of Sinnar converted to Islam in the 16th century but maintained independent control of the southwestern areas of Eritrea until being absorbed into the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. With the feudal rule of the Bahr negash in the predominantly christian highland interior severely weakened from the 17th century up until modern times, the area became dubbed ''Mereb Mellash'' by locals and neighboring Ethiopians alike, meaning "beyond the Mereb" (in Tigrinya). This name defined the territory as being north of the [[Mareb River]] which to this day is a natural boundary between the modern states of Eritrea and Ethiopia.<ref>Daniel Kendie, ''The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict''</ref> Roughly the same area also came to be referred to as [[Hamasien]], a name that survived until modern times, designating a much smaller area (province) immediately surrounding the capital Asmara, until being absorbed into the new administrative divisions in 1994. In these areas, feudal authority was particularly weak or nonexistent, and the autonomy of the landowning peasantry was particularly strong; a kind of "Republic" was prevalent, governed by local customary laws legislated by elected elder's councils (''shimagile''). <ref>Dennis J. Duncanson ''Sir'at 'Adkeme Milga'. A Native Law Code of Eritrea''</ref> In 1770, the Scottish researcher James Bruce describes Hamasien and Abyssinia as "different countries who are often fighting" (SUKE, p. 25).

==Colonialism==

[[Italy|Italian]] colonisation began arguably with the purchase of the locality of [[Assab]] by a [[Roman Catholic]] priest by the name of Giuseppe Sapetto acting on behalf of a [[Genoa|Genovese]] shipping company called "Rubattino" who bought the land from the Afar Sultan of Obock (a vassal of the Ottomans) in 1869. This happened in the same year as the opening of the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name="Britannica_Eritrea-page14">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-37666/Eritrea |title=Eritrea <U+2013> Contesting for the coastlands |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Article |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> With the approval of the Italian parliament and King [[Umberto I]] of Italy (later succeeded by his son [[Victor Emmanuel III]]), the government of Italy bought the Rubattino company's holdings and expanded its possessions northward along the Red Sea coast toward and beyond Massawa, encroaching on and quickly expelling previous 'Egyptian' possessions but meeting stiffer resistance in the Eritrean highlands from the invading army of the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia]]. 
[[Image:Eritrean Railway - Tivedshambo 2008-11-04-edit1.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The [[Eritrean Railway]] was built during Italian colonialism.]]

====Colonia "Primigenia"====

Italy declared Eritrea, a territory of Italy, as of [[New Years Day]] 1890. The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] ruled Eritrea from 1890 to 1941. 

Approximately 100.000 [[Italian Eritreans|Italian colonists]] settled during the 1930s in the ''Colonia Primigenia'' (as was called Eritrea by the Italians, meaning that they considered Eritrea their first and most important colony), mainly in [[Asmara]]. 

Between 1936 and 1941, dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] briefly created the ''[[Italian Empire]]'', with the shortlived union of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. Eritrea enjoyed considerable industrialization and development of modern infrastructure during Italian rule (such as roads and the [[Eritrean Railway]]). 

The Italians remained the colonial power in Eritrea throughout the lifetime of [[fascism]] and the beginnings of [[World War II]], when they were [[East African Campaign (World War II)|defeated]] by Allied forces in 1941, and Eritrea came under British administration.<ref name="Britannica_Eritrea-page14" />

In the Peace Treaty of February 1947 Italy surrendered all her colonies, including Eritrea. While under [[United Kingdom|British]] trusteeship, the [[United Nations]] decided after a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of Eritrea, to federate it with [[Ethiopia]] in 1950.<ref name="UN_GA_res-5">{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/5/ares5.htm |title=General Assembly Resolutions 5th Session |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> 

====Struggle for independence====
[[Image:Shida monument.jpg|thumb|left|The sandals worn by the fighters of independence have become iconic. This monument in Asmara was erected in memoriam.]] 

Barely 10 years into the federation with Ethiopia, in 1961, the 30-year [[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]] began, following the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]'s dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament. 

The Emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.<ref>Semere Haile ''The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation'' Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 15, 1987 (1987), pp. 9-17</ref> Eritreans formed the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF) and rebelled. 

The ELF was initially a conservative grass-roots movement dominated by [[Muslim]] lowlanders and thus received backing from [[Arab]] socialist governments such as Syria and Egypt. Ethiopia's imperial government received support from the United States which had established a radio listening base (the [[Kagnew]] base) in Eritrea's Ethiopian-occupied capital, Asmara. Internal divisions within the ELF based on religion, ideology, ethnicity, clan and, sometimes, personalities, led to the weakening and factioning of the ELF from which sprung the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]]. 
[[Image:Hamid Idriss Awate, founder of Eritrean Armed Revolution 1961.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|[[Hamid Idris Awate]] fired the first shot against Ethiopian government forces in 1 September 1961 at Mount Adal. He went on to create the Eritrean Liberation Army (the armed wing of the Eritrean Liberation Front).]]
 
The EPLF professed Marxism and egalitarian values devoid of gender, religion, or ethnic bias. Its leadership was educated in China. It came to be supported by a growing Eritrean diaspora. Bitter fighting broke out between the ELF and EPLF during the late 1970s and 1980s for dominance over Eritrea. The ELF continued to dominate the Eritrean landscape well into the 1970s when the struggle for independence neared victory due to Ethiopia's internal turmoil caused by a socialist revolution against the monarchy there. The ELF's gains suffered when Ethiopia's ailing US-backed Emperor was deposed and replaced by the [[Derg]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] military junta with backing from the Soviet Union and other communist countries, who continued the Ethiopian policy of repressing Eritrean "separatists" with increased military assistance and fervor. Nevertheless, the Eritrean resistance, which saw itself forced to retreat from most of the Eritrean countryside it had previously occupied, became instead entrenched in the northern parts of the country around the Sudanese border from where the most important supply lines came. The heavily bombarded and embattled northern town of [[Nakfa]] came to symbolize the Eritrean struggle. (The [[Eritrean nakfa|Eritrean currency]] is named after it.)<ref>Killion, Tom (1998). Historical Dictionary of Eritrea. ISBN 0-8108-3437-5.</ref> The numbers of the EPLF swelled in the 1980s. The EPLF relied largely on armaments captured from the Ethiopian army itself as well as financial and political support from the Eritrean diaspora and the cooperation of neighboring states hostile to Ethiopia's government [[Somalia]] and [[Sudan]] (although the support of the latter turned into hostility in agreement with Ethiopia during the [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] administration between 1971 and 1985) as well as Ethiopian resistance and separatist movements. Drought, famine, and intensive offensives launched by the Ethiopian army on Eritrea took a heavy toll on the population &mdash; more than half a million fled to Sudan as refugees. In 1985, Eritrean elite commandos infiltrated the Ethiopian- and Soviet-held air force base in Asmara and destroyed all 30 fighter jets there, suffering only one casualty. In 1988, a massive Ethiopian military offensive against Eritrean rebels backfired with a third of the Ethiopian army annihilated in the northern Eritrean town of Afabet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Worthington|first=Peter|title=Needless war engulfs a unique African oasis|publisher=Toronto Sun}}</ref> Following the decline of the Soviet Union in 1989 and diminishing support for the Ethiopian war, Eritrean rebels advanced further, capturing the port of Massawa and putting the Ethiopian and Soviet naval capabilities there out of action. By 1990 and early 1991 virtually all Eritrean territory had been liberated by the EPLF except for the capital, whose only connection with the rest of government-held Ethiopia during the last year of the war was by an air-bridge. In 1991, the Ethiopian army finally capitulated and its leader [[Mengistu Hailemariam]] fled to [[Zimbabwe]] where he resides to this day. Eritrean rebels entered the capital Asmara and began to govern Eritrea on May 24, 1991. The new Ethiopian government consisting of a coalition of Ethiopian resistance and separatist movements allied with Eritrea's rebels, conceded to Eritrea's demands to have an internationally ([[UN]]) supervised referendum dubbed [[UNOVER]] to be held in Eritrea, which ended in April 1993 with an overwhelming vote by Eritreans for independence. Independence was declared on May 24, 1993.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576168_2/Eritrea.html Eritrea - MSN Encarta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Independence==
[[Image:Er-map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Eritrea]]

Upon Eritrea's declaration of independence, the leader of the EPLF, [[Isaias Afewerki]], became Eritrea's first Provisional [[President]], and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (later renamed the [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]], or PFDJ) created a government.<ref>http://www.dehai.org/conflict/history/birth_of_a_nation.htm#Referendum_Results</ref>

Faced with limited economic resources and a country shattered by decades of war, the government embarked on a reconstruction and defense effort, later called the [[Warsai Yikalo Program]], based on the labour of national servicemen and women. It is still ongoing and deploys the enlisted into a combination of duties ranging from military service to construction projects, health care, teaching and training/education as well as agricultural work to improve the country's food security.<ref>[http://www.shaebia.org/wwwboard/messages/227.html Warsai-Yikalo Campaign for Radical Development Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The government also attempts to tap into the resources of the Eritreans living abroad by levying a 2% tax on the gross income of those who wish to gain full economic rights and access as citizens in Eritrea (land ownership, business licenses and other privileges for nationals etc),<ref>[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1111.html Eritrea<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> while at the same time encouraging tourism and investment both from Eritreans living abroad and other foreign investors. This has been complicated by Eritrea's tumultuous relations with its neighbours, lack of stability and subsequent political problems. 

Eritrea severed diplomatic relations with [[Sudan]] in 1994, citing that the latter was hosting Islamic terrorist groups to destabilize Eritrea, and both countries entered into an acrimonious relationship, each accusing the other of hosting various opposition rebel groups or "terrorists" and soliciting outside support to destabilize the other. Diplomatic relations were resumed in 2005 following a reconciliation agreement reached with the help of [[Qatar]]'s negotiation in 1999.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/irin_5399b.html Sudan-Eritrea: Reconciliation Agreement Signed, 5/3/99<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/051210/2005121017.html Sudan, Eritrea resume severed diplomatic relations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Eritrea now plays a prominent role in the internal Sudanese peace and reconciliation effort.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200705040041.html allAfrica.com: East Africa: Darfur And Somalia - Two Peace Efforts, Different Strokes (Page 1 of 3)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Perhaps the conflict with the deepest impact on independent Eritrea has been the renewed hostility with Ethiopia. In 1998, [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|a border war]] with [[Ethiopia]] over the town of [[Badme]] occurred. The [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] ended in 2000 with a negotiated agreement known as the [[Algiers Agreement]], which assigned an independent, UN-associated boundary commission known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries and issue a final and binding ruling. Along with the agreement the UN established a temporary security zone consisting of a 25-kilometre demilitarized buffer zone within Eritrea, running along the length of the disputed border between the two states and patrolled by UN troops in the mission named [[UNMEE]]. Ethiopia was to withdraw to positions held before the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998. The peace agreement would be completed with the implementation of the Border Commission's ruling, also ending the task of the peacekeeping mission of UNMEE. The EEBC's verdict came in April 2002, which awarded [[Badme]] to Eritrea. However, Ethiopia refused to withdraw its military from positions in the disputed areas, including Badme, and also refused to implement the EEBC's ruling, and the dispute is ongoing.<ref>[http://www.dehai.org/conflict/home.htm?events.htm Eritrea-Ethiopia Conflict Information Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Eritrea's diplomatic relations with Djibouti were briefly severed during the border war with Ethiopia in 1998 due to a dispute over Djibouti's intimate relation with Ethiopia during the war but were restored and normalized in 2000. <ref>[http://nationsencyclopedia.com/World-Leaders-2003/Djibouti-FOREIGN-POLICY.html Djibouti - Foreign policy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Relations are again tense due to a renewed border dispute.<ref>http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKL1261733920080612</ref> Similarly, Eritrea and Yemen had a border conflict between 1996 to 1998 over the [[Hanish]] islands and the maritime border, which was resolved in 2000 by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.

[[Image:Eritrea regions numbered.png|thumb|[[Regions of Eritrea]]]]
[[Image:Gash Barkahouses.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Early morning in a [[Gash Barka]] village]]

Eritrea is divided into six [[Regions of Eritrea|regions]] (''zobas'') and subdivided into [[Districts of Eritrea|districts]] ("sub-zobas"). The geographical extent of the regions is based on their respective hydrological properties. This a dual intent on the part of the Eritrean government: to provide each administration with sufficient control over its agricultural capacity, and to eliminate historical intra-regional conflicts. 

The regions, followed by the sub-region, are:

===National elections===
Eritrean National elections were set for 1995 and then postponed until 2001; it was then decided that because 20% of Eritrea's land was under occupation, elections would be postponed until the resolution of the conflict with Ethiopia. However, local elections have continued in Eritrea. The most recent round of local government elections were held in May 2004. On further elections, the President's Chief of Staff, Yemane Ghebremeskel said,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shaebia.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=9&num=2618&printer=1 |title=Interview of Mr. Yemane Gebremeskel, Director of the Office of the President of Eritrea |publisher=PFDJ |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{POV|date=August 2008}}
{{main|Foreign relations of Eritrea}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
Eritrea is a full member state of the African Union (AU), the successor of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). But it has withdrawn its representative to the AU in protest of the AU's lack of leadership in facilitating the implementation of a binding border decision demarcating the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea's relationship with the United States is complicated. Although the two nations have a close working relationship regarding the on-going war on terror, there has been a growing tension in other areas. As of October 2008, relations with the US have worsened.  US [[Assistant Secretary of State]], [[Jendayi Frazer]], has called the nation a '[[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]]' and the US government has added Eritrea to its list of [[rogue states]], along with [[Iran]] and [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pmddtc.state.gov/embargoed_countries/index.html |title=Embargoed Countries |publisher=US Department of State  |date=October 6, 2008}}</ref>  The reason for this is the presence of [[Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys]], an exiled [[Somali people|Somali]] Islamist leader, whom the US suspects of having links to [[Al Qaeda]], at a recent Somali opposition conference in [[Asmara]].  Economic sanctions against Eritrea could soon follow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6987916.stm |title=How Eritrea fell out with the west |publisher=BBC |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate = 2007-09-12}}</ref>  Eritrea's relationship with Italy and the EU has become equally strained in many areas in the last three years.

Within the region, Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia turned from that of close alliance to a deadly rivalry that led to a war from May 1998 to June 2000 in which approximately 19,000 Eritreans<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1398446.stm|title=Eritrea reveals human cost of war|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and 123,000 Ethiopians<ref>Claimed on 8 April 2002 by the Voice of the Democratic Path of Ethiopian Unity, an Ethiopian clandestine opposition group operating from Germany. The claim also stated that each family that lost a member in the war would receive $350 in indemnity, but this number has not been verified, although it has been often cited by other groups (see [http://lists.sn.apc.org/pipermail/pol.ethiopia/2001-April/000381.html  Number of war dead soldiers reportedly 123,000] &ndash; internet news message; and [http://www.clandestineradio.com clandestineradio.com] [http://www.clandestineradio.com/intel/station.php?id=65&stn=54 audio button]), and no indemnities have been paid {{As of|2007|lc=on}}.

External issues include an undemarcated border with [[Sudan]], a war with [[Yemen]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1996, and a recent border conflict with [[Ethiopia]]. 

The undemarcated border with Sudan poses a problem for Eritrean external relations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3400575.stm |title=Eritrea-Sudan relations plummet |publisher=BBC |date=2004-01-15 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref> After a high-level delegation to Sudan from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ties are being normalized.

|date=2006-04-18 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref>

A dispute with [[Yemen]] over the [[Hanish Islands]] in 1996 resulted in a brief war. As part of an agreement to cease hostilities the two nations agreed to refer the issue to the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] at [[the Hague]] in 1998.<ref>[http://library2.lawschool.cornell.edu/pca/ER-YEchap1.htm PCA - Documents: Eritrea-Yemen Award - CHAPTER I<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Yemen was granted full ownership of the larger islands while Eritrea was awarded the peripheral islands to the southwest of the larger islands.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2006-07-17 |url=http://www.pca-cpa.org/PDF/chart3.gif |title=International Maritime Boundary}}</ref> At the conclusion of the proceedings, both nations acquiesced to the decision.

The undemarcated border with Ethiopia is the primary external issue facing Eritrea. This  led to a long and bloody border war between 1998 and 2000. As a result, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea ([[UNMEE]]) is occupying a 25&nbsp;kilometers by 900&nbsp;kilometers area on the border to help stabilize the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4041073.stm |title=Q&A: Horn's bitter border war |publisher=BBC |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref> Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war.<ref name="horntension1">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3457957.stm |title=Horn tensions trigger UN warning |publisher=BBC |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4400580.stm |title=Army build-up near Horn frontier |publisher=BBC |date=2005-11-02 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref><ref name="horntension3">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4555892.stm |title=Horn border tense before deadline |publisher=BBC |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref> Central to the continuation of the stalemate is Ethiopia's failure to abide by the border delimitation ruling and reneging on its commitment to demarcation. The stalemate has led the President of Eritrea to urge the UN to take action on Ethiopia. This request is outlined in the [[Wikisource:Eleven Letters|Eleven Letters]] penned by the President to the United Nations Security Council. The situation is further escalated by the continued effort of the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders in supporting each other's opposition.
On July 26, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Eritrea had been supplying weapons to the Somali insurgent group [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], which is allegedly tied to [[al Qaeda]], but no evidence of this has been discovered. The incident has fueled concerns that [[Somalia]] may become the grounds for a ''de facto'' war between Eritrea and [[Ethiopia]]. Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 with [[United States|U.S.]] assistance to overthrow the rule of the widely popular [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), which had stabilized the country and unified the capital [[Mogadishu]] for the first time since 1991. Amid fears of an emerging Islamic and nationalist Somalia, Ethiopia with US assistance invaded Somalia, putting in place the weak and locally unpopular [[United Nations|UN]]/[[African Union|AU]]-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]], which without Ethiopian support had been unable to exercise any control beyond its base in [[Baidoa]] and along the Ethio-Somali border.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/07/26/somalia.arms.ap/index.html |title="U.N.: Eritrea giving arms to Somalis tied to al Qaeda" |publisher=CNN |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate = 2007-08-04}}</ref> For its part, Eritrea is hosting members of the ousted Union of Islamic Courts and the Somali Free Parliament.

Thus, even though the Eritrean government bringing these same rebels to the table is positive, the US claims that the Eritrean government is doing this "by effectively destabilizing Sudan, because they're paying for rebels who are part of the process of destabilizing that country."<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/spbr/2007/91231.htm Eritrea's role in Sudan criticized by America]</ref> According to [[Human Rights Watch]](HRW), the Eritrean government was coercing the Somali Islamist opposition group [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]] (ARS) so that the peace talks in Somalia will fail. In its report, HRW stated that:
<blockquote>"Eritrea's efforts to control the ARS and coerce its leaders into rejecting the idea of a negotiated peace were a primary reason that the mainstream core of the opposition alliance relocated to Djibouti in 2008. Eritrea continues to play host to a small breakaway faction of the ARS led by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and has reportedly continued to provide weapons and funds to abusive insurgent groups. One member of the ARS central committee in Djibouti told Human Rights Watch that, "Eritrea will make a maximum effort to make the [Djibouti peace] agreement fail."<ref>[http://jimmatimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=31564 HRW report on Somalia: Eritrea, Ethiopia roles]</ref>

==Government and media censorship==
In the 2007 and 2008 [[Reporters Without Borders]] ''Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index'' Eritrea ranked last at number 169,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=24025 Reporters sans fronti<U+00E8>res - Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index - 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=rsf2008>[http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=736]</ref> unseating the previous record holder [[North Korea]] which had been last every other year of the survey.

==Geography==
[[Image:Eritrean Highlands.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Eritrean highlands.]]
{{main|Geography of Eritrea}}
Eritrea is located in Northeast Africa, more specifically in the [[Horn of Africa]], and is bordered on the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]]. The country is virtually bisected by one of the world's longest mountain ranges, the [[Great Rift Valley]], with fertile lands to the west, descending to desert in the east. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea is the home of the fork, in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline. The land to the south, in the highlands, is slightly drier and cooler.

The [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another: the Arabian Plate, and the two parts of the African Plate (the Nubian and the Somali plate) splitting along the East African Rift Zone (USGS). The highest point of the country, [[Emba Soira]], is located in the center of Eritrea, at 9,902&nbsp;ft (3,018&nbsp;metres ) above sea level. 

The main cities of the country are the capital city of [[Asmara]] and the port town of [[Asseb]] in the southeast, as well as the towns of [[Massawa]] to the east, and [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] to the north.

== Environment ==

Eritrea formerly supported a large population of [[elephants]]. [[Ptolemaic kingdom|Ptolemaic kings]] of Egypt used it as a source of war elephants in the third century BC. Between 1955 and 2001 there were no reported sightings of elephant herds, and they are thought to have fallen victim to the war of independence. In December 2001 a herd of about 30, including 10 juveniles, was observed in the vicinity of the [[Gash River]]. The elephants seemed to have formed a symbiotic relationship with [[olive baboons]]. It is estimated that there are around 100 elephants left in Eritrea, the most northerly of East Africa's elephants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=BBC Wildlife Magazine |month=July | year=2003 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/300feature1.shtml |title=The rediscovery of Eritrea's elephants |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref>

In 2006, Eritrea announced it would become the first country in the world to turn its entire coast into an environmentally protected zone. The 1,347&nbsp;km (837 mile) coastline, along with another 1,946&nbsp;km (1,209-miles) of coast around its more than 350 islands, will come under governmental protection.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Eritrea}}
{{seealso|Eritrean Railway|Transport in Eritrea}}
[[Image:Agordatmen.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Men in [[Agordat]]]]
Like the economies of many other [[Africa]]n nations, the economy is largely based on subsistence [[agriculture]], with 80% of the population involved in farming and herding. The only natural disaster that sometimes affects Eritrea, drought, has often created trouble in the farming areas.<ref>[http://www.encapafrica.org/documents/PEA_pestmanagement/ERITREA_LG_SEA_MAR93.doc An Environmental Impact Assessment of African Armyworm Control in Eritrea: An Amendment to the "Eritrean Supplemental Environmental Assessment For Grasshopper And Locust Control".]</ref> 

The [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] severely hurt Eritrea's economy. [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth in 1999 fell to less than 1%, and GDP decreased by 8.2% in 2000. In May 2000, Ethiopian offensive into southern Eritrea caused some $600 million in property damage and loss, including losses of $225 million in [[livestock]] and 55,000 homes. The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea's most productive region, causing food production to drop by 62%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/er.html#Econ |title=Economy - overview |publisher=CIA |date=2006-06-06 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1184714.stm |title=Aid sought for Eritrean recovery |publisher=BBC |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref>

Even during the war, Eritrea developed its transportation [[infrastructure]], asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges as a part of the [[Wefri Warsay Yika'alo|Warsay Yika'alo Program]]. The most significant of these projects was the building of a coastal highway of more than 500&nbsp;km connecting [[Massawa]] with [[Asseb]] as well as the rehabilitation of the [[Eritrean Railway]]. The rail line now runs between the Port of Massawa and the capital Asmara.

Eritrea's economic future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole to fill. Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master fundamental social problems like [[illiteracy]], and low skills.

As of May 6, 2008 Eritrea is the most expensive place in the world to buy fuel. At $9.58 per gallon, gasoline is 85<U+00A2> a gallon higher than in the next most expensive country, Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/01/news/international/usgas_price/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=U.S. gas: So cheap it hurts |publisher=CNN Money |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>

Eritrean society is ethnically heterogeneous. An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the [[Tigrinya people]] and the [[Tigre people]] together make up about 80% of the population. These form the bulk of the country's predominantly [[Semitic]]-speaking population.

The rest of the population is comprised of other [[Afro-Asiatic]] groups such as the [[Saho people|Saho]], [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]], [[Afar people|Afar]], and [[Bilen people|Bilen]]. These [[Cushitic]]-speaking peoples are thought to be the oldest inhabitants of the [[Horn of Africa]].

There are also a number of [[Nilotic]] peoples who are represented in Eritrea by the [[Kunama people|Kunama]] and [[Nara people|Nara]]. 

Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language. 

There exist minorities of [[Italian Eritreans]] (concentrated in Asmara) and Ethiopian Tigrayans. Neither is generally given citizenship unless through marriage or, more rarely, by having it conferred upon them by the State. 

The most recent addition to the nationalities of Eritrea is the [[Rashaida]]. The Rashaida came to Eritrea in the 19th century<ref>{{cite web |last=Alders |first=Anne |url=http://www.eritreanbeauty.com/r.html |title=the Rashaida |accessdate = 2006-06-07}}</ref> from the Arabian Coast. The Rashaida intermarried with the Tigre and Beja clans, and  are typically nomadic, and number approximately 61,000, less than 1% of the population. 

Ethnic groups with low population have little influence on life in Eritrea.

===Languages===

{{main|Languages of Eritrea}}
Many languages are spoken in Eritrea today.The country has two official languages, [[Tigrinya]] and [[Arabic]], which are also the two predominant languages for official purposes. [[Italian Language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]] are also widely understood.<ref>[http://home.planet.nl/~hans.mebrat/eritrea-languages.htm Languages of Eritrea - Tigrinya<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Most of the languages spoken in Eritrea stem from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language family. The Semitic languages in Eritrea are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (spoken natively by the [[Rashaida]] Arabs), [[Tigre language|Tigre]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and the newly recognized [[Dahlik language|Dahlik]]; these languages (primarily Tigre and Tigrinya) are spoken as a first language by over 80% of the population. The Cushitic languages in Eritrea are just as numerous, including [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Beja language|Beja]], [[Blin language|Blin]], and [[Saho language|Saho]]. [[Kunama language|Kunama]] and [[Nara language|Nara]] are also spoken in Eritrea and belong to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language family]]. [[English language|English]] is spoken to a degree by more educated Eritreans and a legacy of British occupation. [[Italian language|Italian]] is a legacy of colonial times.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Eritrea}}
There are five levels of education in Eritrea: pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary, and post-secondary. There are nearly 238,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools<ref>{{cite book |year=2005 |title=Baseline Study on Livelihood Systems in Eritrea |publisher=National Food Information System of Eritrea}}</ref> in Eritrea and two universities (University of Asmara and the Institute of Science and Technology) as well as several smaller colleges and technical schools. 

One of the most important goals of Eritrea's education policy is to provide basic education in each of Eritrea's mother tongues, as well as to develop a self-motivated and conscientious population to fight poverty and disease. Furthermore it is tooled to produce a society that is equipped with the necessary skills to function in the modern economy. 

The education system in Eritrea is also designed to promote [[private sector]] schooling, equal access for all groups (i.e., to prevent [[gender discrimination]], [[ethnic discrimination]], and class discrimination, etc.) and promote continuing education, both formally and informally. 

Education in Eritrean include kindergartens for young children of both genders.

Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional [[taboos]], school fees (for registration and materials), and the [[opportunity costs]] of [[low-income]] households.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kifle |first=Temesgen |year=2002 |title=Educational Gender Gap in Eritrea}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Eritrea}}
[[Image:Churchesndmosque eritrea.jpg|thumb|left|Enda Mariam Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Cathedral, Al Khulafa Al Rashiudin  Mosque (in the foreground, rear left, and rear right respectively) in the capital [[Asmara]].]]
Eritrea has two dominant religions, [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], with approximately half of the population belonging to each faith. Most Muslims follow [[Sunni Islam]]. The Christians consist primarily of the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church]], which is the local [[Oriental Orthodox]] church, and considerable groups of [[Roman Catholic]]s (including Italian Eritreans), [[Protestant]]s, and other denominations also exist.

Since May 2002, the Government of Eritrea has officially recognized the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church]], [[Sunni Islam]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and the Evangelical [[Lutheran]] church. All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process. {{Fact|date=January 2009}} Among other things, the Government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership to be allowed to [[worship]]. {{Fact|date=January 2009}} The few organisations that have met all of the registration requirements have still not received official recognition. {{Fact|date=January 2009}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and numerous Protestant denominations are not registered and cannot worship freely. They have effectively been banned, and measures have been taken against their adherents. Many have been incarcerated for months or even years. None have been charged officially or given access to the judicial process. In its 2006 religious freedom report, the U.S. State Department for the third year in a row named Eritrea a "Country of Particular Concern", designating it one of the worst violators of religious freedom in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108367.htm | title=Eritrea.

There is one last native Jew in Eritrea, formerly from a community of hundreds in Asmara, whose ancestors had crossed from Aden in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4955088.stm |title=Asmara's last Jew recalls 'good old days' |publisher=BBC |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate = 2006-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3246419,00.html |title=Eritrea's last native Jew tends graves, remembers |publisher=Y Net News |date=2006-05-02 |accessdate = 2006-09-26}}</ref>

{{main|Culture of Eritrea}}
{{seealso|Cuisine of Eritrea|Literature of Eritrea|Music of Eritrea}}
The Eritrean region has traditionally been a nexus for [[trade]] throughout the world. Because of this, the influence of diverse [[cultures]] can be seen throughout Eritrea. Today, the most obvious influences in the capital, Asmara, are those of Italy. Throughout Asmara, there are small cafes serving beverages common to Italy. In Asmara, there is a clear merging of the Italian colonial influence with the traditional Tigrinya lifestyle. In the villages of Eritrea, these changes never took hold. 

In the cities, before the occupation and during the early years, the import of [[Bollywood]] films was commonplace, while Italian and American films were available in the cinemas as well. In the 1980s and since independence, however, American films have become the most common. Vying for market share are films by local producers, who have slowly come into their own. The global broadcast of Eri-TV has brought cultural images to the large Eritrean population in the Diaspora who frequents the country every summer. Successful domestic films are produced by government and independent studios with revenue from ticket sales typically covering the production costs.

Traditional Eritrean dress is quite varied, with the women of most lowland ethnicities traditionally dressing in brightly colored clothes, while the Tigrinya traditionally dress in bright white costumes. Of the Muslim ethnicities, only the Arab or Rashaida tribeswomen maintain a tradition of covering their faces.  

Popular sports in Eritrea are football and bicycle racing. In recent years Eritrean athletes have seen increasing success in the international arena.

Almost unique on the African continent, is the [[Tour of Eritrea]], whose first race was created by the [[Italian Eritreans|Italians]] in 1946.<ref>http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/Sport/Ciclismo/giro_di_vita.htm The first Tour of Eritrea (in italian)</ref>  The Tour is a bicycle race from the hot desert beaches of Massawa, up the winding mountain highway with its precipitous valleys and cliffs to the capital Asmara. From there, it continues downwards onto the western plains of the Gash-Barka Zone, only to return back to Asmara from the south. This is, by far, the most popular sport in Eritrea. 

Recently long-distance running has garnered its own supporters. The momentum for long-distance running in Eritrea can be seen in the successes of [[Zersenay Tadese]], who won a bronze medal for Eritrea in the 2004 Olympics, and [[Mebrahtom Keflezighi|Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi]], also an Olympian of Eritrean descent competing for the United States.
