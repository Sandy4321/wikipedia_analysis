{{for2|the poem by Robert Frost|[[Acquainted with the Night]]}}

'''''Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark''''' (or ''Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours'') is a non-fiction book by [[Christopher Dewdney]] about various aspects of [[night]]. It was first published in 2004 by [[HarperCollins]]. It uses the same title as the [[Robert Frost]] poem "[[Acquainted with the Night]]". The book consists of 14 chapters, with one chapter dedicated to each hour of the night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Mini-essays populate each chapter which each follow a theme, like nocturnal creatures, dreams, astronomy, and mythology. Other subjects and topics touched upon include science, art, culture, natural history, superstitions, and psychology. The book was a finalist for the [[2004 Governor General's Awards]] and for the 2005 [[Charles Taylor Prize]].

==Background==
At the time of ''Acquainted with the Night'''s writing, author and poet Christopher Dewdney was 52 years old and living in Toronto with his wife, [[Barbara Gowdy]]. He had previously written 14 books, the last being the 2002 book of poetry, ''The Natural History''. His previous non-fiction books were ''Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era'' (1998) on the impacts of technological advances on humanism, ''The Secular Grail: Paradigms of Perception'' (1993) regarding the human psyche, and ''The Immaculate Perception'' (1986) on his views of consciousness, language and dreams. Dewdney's past books were described as being "more admired than read".<ref name=Wake/> On the topic of 'the night', he had a life-long fascination with nightlife and eventually decided to write a book about it.<ref>{{cite book |last = Dewdney |first = Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Dewdney |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |year = 2004 |isbn= 0002006391 |pages = 1<U+2013>2}}</ref> He quickly became overwhelmed by the amount of information relating to the subject. For research, he consulted a variety of genres and formats, including books, journals, magazines, music, and movies, and collected information within the broad topics of art, science, social sciences and history. The perspective Dewdney took was that of "explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all".<ref>Dewdney, 5.</ref>

==Content==
The content is divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an introduction and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including [[sunset]]s, the [[green flash]], the stages of [[twilight]], as well as [[Olbers' paradox]], and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night with a focus on [[bat]]s, [[nighthawk]]s, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of [[nightclub]]s, [[street light]]s, and the impacts of [[light pollution]]. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the [[circadian rhythm]] and the physiology of sleep and dreams.

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=left|quote=<div style="text-align:left;">The attacks would almost always strike during the REM phase of the victim's first sleep cycle of the night... [One patient] who had survived several attacks said that, during each attack, something came into his bedroom, sat on his chest, and tried to crush the air out of his lungs. In one nightmare it was a cat, in another a dog, and once it was a woman.</div>

The 12 am chapter traces the history behind dream interpretation from [[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and Calvin Hall. Here, Dewdney considers nightmares and takes [[sudden unexplained death syndrome]], whose sufferers are almost always Asian males, between 20 and 49 years old, as an extreme example of nightmares that cause the dreamer to die from a "[[ventricular fibrillation]]...brought about by extreme terror".<ref>Dewdney, 178.</ref> The 1 am chapter compares literary and mythological personifications of, or beings associated with, the night. The 2 am chapter tells the stories of the legends behind the [[moon]] and the constellations. The 3 am chapter is all about [[insomnia]]. The 4 am chapter provides a geographical aspect, touring the places with long nights, like [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], [[cave]]s, the [[Polar night|poles]], and deep within the oceans. The 5 am chapter discusses artistic representations of night, especially in music, on film and through paintings. The final chapter is a conclusion in which Dewdney reflects on memorable sunrises he has experienced and contrasts sunrises with sunsets.

==Style==
The title shares its name with the [[Robert Frost]] poem [[Acquainted with the Night]], which is quoted on the first page.<ref>Dewdney, 1.</ref> The book's structure uses twelve chapters, equating to twelve hours of night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Two additional chapters, "First Night" and "Night's Last Stand", bookend the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion. This hour-by-hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics.<ref name=Wigod>{{cite news |last= Wigod |first=Rebecca |title= Night falls, and things happen |newspaper= [[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=June 5, 2004 |page=D13}}</ref> The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture, superstitions, natural history, physiology, and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book "a compendium",<ref name=Jamieson/> "a browser's book"<ref name=Atwood/> and full of "encyclopedic mini-essays".<ref name=Birkerts/> Autobiographical passages are also included.<ref name=Gargan/> One reviewer noted the format uses personal observations that lead to discussions of broad subjects with "side trips into relevant supporting materials".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Meriwether |first= Doris |month = November |year= 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Magill Book Reviews]]}}</ref>

The reviewer for the ''[[Quill & Quire]]'' cited the book as an example of a sub-genre which an article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' dubbed "mundane studies" referring to the ubiquity of the subject, like [[Mark Kurlansky]]'s ''[[Salt: A World History]]'' and [[Witold Rybczynski]]'s ''[[One Good Turn (book)|One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw]]''.<ref name=Dinka/> Dewdney's writing in ''Acquainted with the Night'' combines a poet's point of view with an interest for the sciences.<ref name=Wake/> The tone was described as "boyish enthusiasm"<ref name=Atwood/> and "highly condensed yet personable voice".<ref name=Pubweekly/>  Gis<U+00E8>le Baxter, in the journal ''Canadian Literature'', wrote that the its tone was set at the beginning of the book by "an anecdote of a small boy creeping into the moonlit, partly wooded backyard of his family home".<ref name=Baxter>{{cite journal |last= Baxter |first= Gis<U+00E8>le |month = Winter |year= 2006 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Canadian Literature (journal)|Canadian Literature]] |issue= 191 |pages= 189<U+2013>190}}</ref>

Regarding Dewdney's writing, the reviewer for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote that Dewdney writes carefully and "confidently".<ref name=Pubweekly>{{cite journal |date= April 26, 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Publishers Weekly]] |volume= 251 |issue=17 |page= 49}}</ref> Another reviewer called the book "engaging and recreational".<ref>{{cite journal |month = April |year= 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume= 72 |issue=7 |page= 308}}</ref> Gis<U+00E8>le Baxter, in ''Canadian Literature'', found his use of language "provok[es] consideration through its elegant turns of phrase and image"<ref name=Baxter/> and Laura Wright, in ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' called the imagery "arresting".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Wright |first= Laura |month = August |year= 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |volume= 25 |issue=8 |page= 82}}</ref> In the ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', poet and novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote, "The prose moves from the strictly informative to the lyrical to the charming to the amusing to the odd to the strangely moving without batting an eye."<ref name=Atwood>{{cite news |last= Atwood |first=Margaret |title= Mesmerized by the night |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=May 22, 2004 |page=D7}}</ref> Another reviewer noted Dewdney "combined a deft lyric touch with a deep interest in science".<ref name=Wake>{{cite news |last= Wake |first=Hal |title= Acquainted With the Night |newspaper= [[The Georgia Straight]] |agency= Vancouver Free Press |date=June 17, 2004 |url= http://www.straight.com/node/2393/print |accessdate= November 2, 2009}}</ref> The reviewer for ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' wrote that "the strength of the book is in its artful mix of science and poetry".<ref name=Jamieson>{{cite journal |last= Findlay |first= Jamieson |month = July/August |year= 2004 |title= An enlightening romp through darkness |journal= [[Canadian Geographic]] |volume= 124 |issue=4 |page= 109}}</ref> Literary critic [[Sven Birkerts]] found Dewdney to be "an engaging enough narrator and solid, enthusiastic stylist".<ref name=Birkerts>{{cite news |last= Birkerts |first=Sven |authorlink= Sven Birkerts |title= Heart of darkness |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 8, 2004 |url= http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2004/08/08/heart_of_darkness/ |accessdate= November 2, 2009}}</ref> The book's structure received mixed reviews, some reviewers found Dewdney was able to effectively transition between various topics while other reviewers did not. Birkerts wrote the book has "a fun-facts-fished-from-the-data-ocean...[and] end-of-term crammer" sense to it.<ref name=Birkerts/> The ''[[Quill & Quire]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewers found the topics were too cursory, like "an encyclopedia entry".<ref name=Dinka>{{cite journal |last= Dinka |first= Nicholas |month = July |year= 2004 |title= Night moves |journal= [[Quill & Quire]] |volume= 70 |issue=7 |page= 36 |url= http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=4013 |accessdate= November 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date = June 14, 2004 |title= Dark thoughts |journal= [[The Economist]] |volume= 372 |issue=8388 |page= 76}}</ref> Birkerts concluded "that any one of Dewdney's excursions could earn its keep as a column in a popular science magazine" but assembled into one book the topics seemed random.<ref name=Birkerts/>
