It was released by [[Loud Records]] in 2001 as a [[12-inch single|12 inch]] with "Yo Yo Yo" as its [[b-side]]. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features raps by Juju and Psycho Les, as well as a chorus performed by [[Fatman Scoop]] and additional vocals by Zhana. The song's main lyrical theme is the [[hedonism|hedonistic]] joys of partying and having money. The song's beat is characterized by its fast guitar-driven loop and hard slapping drums.

"Let's Git Doe" failed to chart or receive an accompanying music video. The song additionally attracted negative critical attention.  Tadah of UrbanSmarts.com declared: <blockquote>While uptempo cuts usually are very appreciated, ["Let's Git Doe"] is rather annoying, again the guitar just not cutting it, and while Scoop does have that voice to command us, this track just sounds like a [[LP album|33 1/3 record]] played at [[Gramophone record|45]].<ref name="us">{{cite web | last = | first = Tadah | url = http://www.urbansmarts.com/reviews/albums/thebeatnuts.html | title = Take It or Squeeze It Review | publisher = UrbanSmarts.com | accessdate = July 3, 2008}}</ref></blockquote> 
Despite lacking positive critical attention, it is included on The Beatnuts' 2001 hits compilation ''[[Beatnuts Forever]]'', and DJ Enuff's 2001 compilation ''Heavy Hits''.
