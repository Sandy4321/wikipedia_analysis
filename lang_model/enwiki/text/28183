'''Demetrius of Pharos''' (also '''Pharus''') ({{lang-el|<U+0394><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03AE><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+1F10><U+03BA> <U+03A6><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}) was a ruler of [[Hvar|Pharos]] involved in the [[Illyrian Wars|First Illyrian War]], after which he ruled a portion of the [[Illyria]]n [[Adriatic]] coast on behalf of the Romans, as a [[client king]].<ref>Hammond, p. 257.</ref> 

Demetrius was a regent ruler to [[Pinnes]], the son of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]] who was too young to rule as king. When the Romans were occupied with their own problems, he had grown stronger as an ally of Macedonia and also by conquering Dimallum of [[Dalmatia]], on the shore facing  [[Vis (island)|Issa]]. Together with [[Scerdilaidas]], he sailed south of [[Lissus]] and broke the Roman treaty, attacking Roman allies in the Adriatic and by devastating and plundering many cities in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Peloponnese]]. He was expelled from Illyria by Rome after the [[Illyrian Wars|Second Illyrian War]] and became a trusted councilor at the court of [[Philip V of Macedon]]. He became a strong political influence to Philip V and encouraged him to clash with [[Rome]]. Demetrius remained there until his death at [[Messene]] in 214 BC while attempting to take the city.

==First Illyrian War==
In 229 BC, continuing the expansion of Illyrian power that Agron had begun, Teuta systematically<ref><U+00C9>pire, Illyrie, Mac<U+00E9>doine: m<U+00E9>langes offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes by Dani<U+00E8>le Berranger, Pierre Cabanes, Dani<U+00E8>le Berranger-Auserve, p. 136.</ref> attacked [[Vis (island)|Issa]], the polis of [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]] and [[Epidamnus]]. [[Lissus]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Corcyra Nigra]] were all threatened as Teuta annexed Epirus in the south. After a naval battle of the island of [[Paxos]], the island of [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]] surrendered, and Demetrius was placed in charge by Teuta as one of her philio's.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.10 2.10]; Wilkes, p. 160.</ref> 

When the Romans were on their way towards Corcyra in the first engagement of the [[First Illyrian War]], Demetrius betrayed Teuta. Demetrius was slandered by Teuta and feared her, and gave up Corcyra to the Romans, and went over to the Roman side, acting as their guide for their campaign in Illyria.<ref>Polybius II,11,6</ref> Rome was quickly victorious while Teuta fled to [[Rhizon]] in [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Risan]], [[Montenegro]]), and Demetrius was placed in charge of most of the rest of Ardiaean Kingdom, as a client of Rome.<ref>Wilkes, p. 161; Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.11 2.11].</ref> Demetrius was rewarded with the rule of his birthplace, the island of Pharos, and a part of the land next to it, but this was only temporary. The Romans annexed the southern conquests of Teuta and also one of the conditions imposed by Rome, following the war, expressly prohibited Illyrian warships south of [[Lissus]].<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.12 2.12].</ref>

==Revival of power==
The decade after 229 BC witnessed a revival of Illyrian power under Demetrius who succeeded Teuta. Following the war, Demetrius married [[Triteuta]] in or around 222 BC, Agron's first wife and mother of Pinnes which consolidated his position. His marriage to Triteuta mean that Demetrius formally took over the regency of the Ardiaean Kingdom. Demetrius' own influence was thereby greatly extended, and the fundamental weakness of the Ardiaean Kingdom after 229 BC, that there was no competent regent for Pinnes was relieved. The king began to renew traditional Illyrian ties with Macedonia.<ref>Wilkes, p. 162; Errington, p. 91.</ref> In 222 BC an Illyrian corps of 1600 fought with distinction under the command of Demetrius at [[Sellasia]], where the Macedonians won a conclusive victory over the Spartans.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+2.65 2.65].</ref> After Sellasia, Demetrius began attempting to extend his control over Illyria at the expense of Rome.<ref name="3.16">Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+3.16 3.16].</ref>

Before then, when Rome was preoccupied  with a war against the [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples of the [[Po Valley|Po]] valley in northern [[Italy]] from 225-222 BC, Demetrius detached the Illyrian Atintani from their Roman alliance. In addition, he sailed south of Lissus, [[Lezh<U+00EB>]] in present day [[Albania]], and engaged in piracy in contravention of the settlement in 228 BC. In 221 BC Demetrius also created an alliance with the Illyrian Histri at the head of the Adriatic, who were interfering with Roman supply ships. A Roman fleet soon attacked the Histri.<ref>Appian, Illyrike 8</ref> Early in the summer of 221 BC, when tension was rising in [[Greece]] as Macedonia made an alliance with the [[Achaean League]] against the [[Aetolian League]], the Illyrian attacked in their traditional manner. 

In 220 BC Demetrius and the Illyrian commander, [[Scerdilaidas]] sailed south of Lissus with ninety [[Lembus|lembi]]. After an assault on [[Pylos]] in the western [[Peloponnese]] had failed they separated their forces, Demetrius taking his chances in plundering the [[Cyclades]] while Scerdilaidas returned north. On putting in at Naupactus with forty ships Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his broth-in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join the Aetolians in their planned invasion of [[Achaea]]. With help from Cynaethan traitors, they attacked, seized and burned Cynaetha, a town in the north of [[Arcadia]], located on the northern slope of the [[Aroanian Mountains]]. They also attacked but failed to take [[Cleitor]]. Meanwhile Demetrius continued on into the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] with 50 ships. He sailed to the [[Cyclades]], where he extorted tribute from some of the islands and plundered the others.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+3.16 3.16], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.16 4.16], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.19 4.19].</ref> Chased by [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] warships,<ref>For the Rhodians, who made their living as maritime traders, piracy was a serious problem; with Macedon and Egypt having abandoned their control in the Aegean, it fell to Rhodes to police these waters. See: Walbank (1970), p. 109 and Strabo, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+14.2.5 14.2.5].</ref> Demetrius put into [[Cenchreae]], the Aegean port of [[Corinth]]. At the same time the Macedonian commander in Corinth, [[Taurion]], learned of Scerdilaidas' and the Aetolians' invasion. Taking his cue from the Aetolians, Taurion agreed to drag Demetrius' ships across the Isthmus to bring them into play in the Gulf of Corinth, in return for Demetrius' assistance against the Aetolians. Although Demetrius conducted a few raids on the Aetolian coast, he was too late to hinder the Aetolians' return from Achaea.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+4.19 4.19].</ref>

After returning to the Ardiaean Kingdom, Demetrius continued operations during the following winter, attacking and seizing Roman allied cities and communities in southern Illyria.<ref>Hammond 1968</ref> The Romans who hithero ignored the activities of their former ally, decided that the harbors on the coast of the Ardiaean Kingdom had now to be made secure, in view of the threat of another war with [[Carthage]].<ref>Dell 1967b</ref> These events precipitated the [[Second Illyrian War]].

==The Second Illyrian War==
{{Main|Illyrian Wars}}

Unlike Teuta in 229 BC, Demetrius was well prepared for the Roman invasion. He first placed a garrison in [[Dimallum]], an Illyrian city-fortress from Apollonia. He eliminated his opponents in other places, those Illyrians who opposed his rule, and stationed 6,000 of his best forces on his home island Pharos. As before, both consuls of the year accompanied the Roman expedition, but the leading role was placed by [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Aemilius Paullus]], who was to be killed in the great Roman disaster at [[Cannae]] three years later. The Adriatic took on particular importance in Romes preparations for the [[Second Punic War]] from 218 to 201 BC. Anticipating a long and difficult war far away from Rome, the Roman [[Senate]] decided first to set matters right in Illyria.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+3.16.1 3.16.1].</ref><ref>Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 B.C. By A. E. Astin, F. W. Walbank, M. W. Frederiksen</ref>

In 219 BC, having decided that Dimallum was crucial to Demetrius' power in the region, the consul prepared to besiege the city but was able to take it by direct assault within seven days.<ref>Wilkes, p. 163.</ref> and went to [[Hvar|Pharos]] As a result all the Illyrian towns and cities of the area submitted to Roman protection, each receiving the appropriate terms and conditions. Next the Romans moved against Demetrius on the island of Pharos, who awaited the attack with good troops, ample provisions an war materials behind strong fortifications, that of the city of [[Issa (polis)|Issa]] at modern [[Stari Grad, Croatia|Stari Grad]]. In order to avoid a long siege Aemilius decided to risk another frontal attack. The Roman army moved from the mainland to a wooded area of the island.<ref>Appian, (Illyrike 8)</ref> Meanwhile the nest day, a small force of ships was sent out to tempt Demetrius from behind his fortifications. Demetrius marched down to the harbor to oppose the Roman landing. The strategy worked, and when the main Roman army appeared from another direction on the island, the Illyrian army was forced to give battle cut off from their city. Attacked on two sides, and cut off from the protection of the city walls, the battle was lost. in 218 BC, the Illyrian forces soon surrendered while Demetrius deserted the island and fled to Macedonia making his way to the court of [[Philip V of Macedon]], who was now the Macedonian king following the death of Antigonus.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+3.18 3.18&ndash;19].</ref><ref>Polybius (3.18-19)</ref>

===Aftermath===
The Romans destroyed the fortifications  of Pharos and before the summer was over Aemilius was back in Rome receiving congratulations for a job well done. Any threat to the Roman hold in Illyria had been eliminated, all the gains of the First Illyrian War had been secured, and the old restrictions of movement imposed on Illyrian kings.<ref>Cassiu Dio. 12 frg.53</ref> Demetrius may have returned to the Ardeaian State and have been attacked by another Roman force, although the regime of [[Pinnes]], now confirmed as king, was left intact. Rome supported a small Ardeaian State ruled by Pinnes and his successors. The Roman republic called for the extradition<ref><U+00C9>pire, Illyrie, Mac<U+00E9>doine: m<U+00E9>langes offerts au professeur Pierre Cabanes by Dani<U+00E8>le Berranger,Pierre Cabanes,Dani<U+00E8>le Berranger-Auserve,page 134</ref> of Demetrius, but Phillip refused. Pinnes was ordered to pay the arrears of tribute, reparations imposed after the war.

The weak Ardaeai State soon fell prey to Macedonia while the partial destruction brought onto the scene the urban koina of the Parthini, Byllines, Amanatini and others.<ref>The Illyrians to the Albanians by [[Neritan Ceka]] pg~122-123</ref>

==Court counselor of Macedonia ==
Demetrius was received warmly by the young king whose father was also called Demetrius, becoming one of Philip's most trusted advisors. According to Polybius, Demetrius was instrumental in turning Philip's ambitions toward Illyria and Rome. In 217 BC when Philip learned of the victory of [[Hannibal]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general, over the Romans, at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], Philip at first showed the letter only to Demetrius. Perhaps seeing a chance to recover his possessions in Illyria and exact a measure of revenge on Rome, Demetrius immediately advised the young king to make peace with the Aetolians, with whom Philip was currently at war, and turn his attentions westward. In a summary of the strategy the situation called for, Polybius makes Demetrius say:

:''For Greece is already entirely obedient to you, and will remain so: the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their disasters in the present war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, is the first step in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when the Romans have suffered a reverse.''<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.101 5.101].</ref>

Philip was easily convinced and followed Demetrius' advice.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.102 5.102&ndash;105].</ref> Evidence of Demetrius' influence can be seen in the treaty of alliance between Philip and Hannibal of 215 BC. One of its articles specified that any peace made with Rome would include as terms that the Romans would relinquish control of Corcyra, [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Epidamnus]], [[Hvar|Pharos]], [[Dimale]], [[Parthini]], and [[Atintania]] and to restore to Demetrius of Pharos all those of his friends now in the dominion of Rome.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.9 7.9].</ref> In 217 BC Philip made war against [[Scerdilaidas]], to recover some territory recently lost and to expand his control westward. Polybius gives as Philip's (and Demetrius') motives that:

:''<U+2026> he thought it a matter of the most vital importance to bring Illyria into a state of good order, with a view to the success of all his projects, and above all of his passage into Italy. For Demetrius was so assiduous in keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king's mind, that Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for he certainly did not rank higher than third in the calculations of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of Rome: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his own prospects. For he had made up his mind that it was only in this way that he could ever recover his principality in Pharos.''<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.108 5.108].</ref>

Such "dreams" eventually led to war with Rome, the [[First Macedonian War]], and [[Second Macedonian War]].

Polybius also blamed Demetrius' influence for Philip's tyrannical behavior.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+5.12 5.12].</ref> One incident involved Philip's apparent role in a massacre carried out by the people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC.<ref>Strabo [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+8.4.8 8.4.8]; Livy [http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy32.html 32.21]; Plutarch, ''Aratus'' 49.3; Walbank (1970), p. 72.</ref> Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the [[acropolis]], Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying that, if you have the heart of an augur, to quit it as quick as you can: but if of a gallant and wise king, to keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.11 7.11].</ref>

However, in this instance Philip took the more moderate advice of Aratus, who advised him to leave. Nevertheless, the incident at Messene marked, the beginning of Philip's deterioration of character, as well as his loss of popularity.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.12 7.12].</ref> Comparing Demetrius to Aratus, Polybius says thatthe life of Aratus sufficiently proved that he would not have committed such an act of wickedness, but that such principles exactly suited Demetrius of Pharos.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.13 7.13].</ref> The moderating influence of Aratus had caused the Greeks to regard Philipwith favour, owing to the greatness of character which he displays, while under Demetrius' guidance, Philiplost the goodwill of the allies and his credit with the rest of Greece<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+7.14 7.14].</ref>

Demetrius was killed the following year attempting to take [[Messene]]. After having rejected Demetrius' advice the previous year, Philip had returned in 214 BC, resolved to follow it.<ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plb.+3.19 3.19]; Walbank (1970), p. 78.</ref>
