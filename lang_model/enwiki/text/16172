According to its statement of principles, "The Political Cesspool Radio Program stands for the The Dispossessed Majority. We represent a philosophy that is pro-White and are against political centralization."<ref name="statement">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/statement.php|title="Statement of Principles"|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref>

==Foundation and history==
In 2000, James Edwards volunteered for [[Pat Buchanan]]'s [[Pat_Buchanan#2000_presidential_campaign|presidential campaign]]. He later said that this experience inspired him to become politically active, and he wrote an essay called "Why I Love Pat Buchanan" in which he stated that he "loves" Buchanan because "he tells it like it is".<ref name=adlbuch2 /> Edwards ran for the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] in 2002 and lost. He met fellow right-wing political activist Austin Farley during that campaign.<ref name=sewage/>

They established Political Cesspool on October 26, 2004, intending to create a [[paleoconservative]] [[alternative media|alternative]] to [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] radio hosts such as [[Sean Hannity]]. They then took in friends Bill Rolen and Jess Bonds as guest hosts and radio technician Art Frith. The group moved to AM 1380 [[WLRM]] in March 2005. Austin Farley left the program in 2006 and was replaced by Winston Smith. Eddie "The Bombardier" Miller joined the group in mid-2006. Geoff Melton was brought in to set up their website in early 2007. As of August 2009, Jess Bonds and Geoff Melton are no longer affiliated with the program.<ref name=about/>

James Edwards is active in the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (COfCC), and the show has hosted several leaders from the CofCC and publications affiliated with it as guests.<ref name="pcgl">{{cite web |url= http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/guestlist.php|title=The Political Cesspool: Guest List|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> He has also described [[Jared Taylor]] of ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'' as his "good friend". ''[[The Nation]]'' has written that Edwards "has leveraged sponsorship from neo-Nazi and Holocaust denial groups to become America's most popular white supremacist radio host." <ref name= about/><ref name="patstandard">{{cite web|title=Why the Buchanan double standard?|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/38470999.html?page=1&comments=1&showAll=|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name="max2" />

Author [[Jerome Corsi]] caused controversy after scheduling an appearance on the show in August 2009 to promote his ''New York Times'' #1 bestselling book, ''[[The Obama Nation]]''. Corsi later cancelled this planned appearance. Corsi stated that the cancellation was the result of "travel plans that changed". James Edwards, on the other hand, said that he believed the incident "just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never have anything to do with anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people." Corsi had already been featured as a guest on the show once before, in July 2009.<ref name="mm"> {{cite web |url= http://mediamatters.org/items/200808140003 |title=Despite "all my apologies" for bigoted comments, Corsi reportedly scheduled to appear on "pro-White" radio show|accessdate=May 1, 2009}} </ref><ref name="spl992">{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=992|title=Jerome Corsi Appears on White Supremacist Radio|accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name="max2" />

Constitution Party nominee [[Michael Peroutka]] appeared on the show to promote his presidential campaign in 2004. A party member described the show as "Christian/Constitutionalist", and "a great blessing to our cause".<ref name="peroutka">{{cite web |url= http://www.peroutka2004.com/schedule/index.php?action=eventview&event_id=718 |title=The Political Cesspool w/James Edwards and Austin Farley|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> [[Thomas Naylor]] of the Vermont [[secessionist]] organization [[Second Vermont Republic]], appeared on the show to celebrate [[Confederate History Month]] in April 2007.<ref name="global"> {{cite web |url= http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/emerging/2008/0605vermont.htm |title=North Meets South: Vermont Secessionists Meet with Racist League of the South |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref>

On May 8, 2006, [[Minuteman Project]] leader [[Jim Gilchrist]] was featured as a guest on the show. Cohost Bill Rolen agreed with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigrants' intentions are to "just squat here and plunder whatever social benefits our programs provide them." However, Rolen's [[neo-Confederate]] views led him to disagree with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigration was "the 21st century [[slave trade (Americas)|slave trade]]".<ref name="spl642">{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=642|title=White Hot|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}</ref>

[[Paleoconservative]] activist and former presidential candidate [[Pat Buchanan]] has appeared on the show twice as of May 2009. In June 2008 he appeared on the show to promote his book ''[[Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War]]'', an appearance which was initiated and arranged by Buchanan's publicist. During this interview, Buchanan also stated that he plans to write a book detailing the possibility of future [[race war]]s. At the end of this interview, James Edwards said, "Mr. Buchanan, thank you so much for coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had appeared on the show to promote ''[[State of Emergency (book)|State of Emergency]]''; in this interview, Buchanan claimed that "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" and that Americans <U+201C>cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico<U+2026>I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States.<U+201D>  <ref name=adl5310>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Extremism_72/5310_72.htm|title=Pat Buchanan Promotes New Book On Racist Radio Show|accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name=adlbuch2>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/Patrick_Buchanan2/extremists.asp|title=Patrick Buchanan: Unrepentant Bigot|accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name=adlbuchh>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/Patrick_Buchanan2/hiding.asp|title=Extremism hiding under a veneer of respectability|accessdate=August 17, 2009}}</ref>

Despite describing itself as "America First" <ref name="donations">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalcesspool.org/donations.php|title="The Political Cesspool Donations Page"|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>, the show has also hosted guests from outside the United States, including Croatian white nationalist [[Tomislav Sunic]], Australian white nationalist [[Drew Fraser]], Russian-Austrian economist [[Yuri Maltsev]], British lawyer [[Adrian Davies]], Canadian conservative blogger [[Kathy Shaidle]], and [[British National Party]] leaders [[Simon Darby]] and [[Nick Griffin]]; Griffin appeared on the show both before and after his election as a [[Member of the European Parliament]].<ref name="pcgl"/>

==Statement of principles==
It describes its philosophy as "pro-White and against political centralization", and its statement of principles is as follows:

:1. The United States government should be independent of any international organization of governments and American law should not be imposed by organizations such as the United Nations. 

:2. America would not be as prosperous, ruggedly individualistic, and a land of opportunity if the founding stock were not Europeans.

:3. Since family is the foundation of any strong society, we are against feminism, abortion, and primitivism.

:4. Private property rights are inviolable. They come from our God-given right to life. 

:5. We wish to revive the White birthrate above replacement level fertility and beyond to grow the percentage of Whites in the world relative to other races. 

:6. Issues such as education, environmental law, and police should be decentralized down to the lowest level to insure natural rights and efficiency. 

:7. Secession is a right of all people and individuals. It [[American Revolution|was successful in 1776]] and this show honors those who tried to make it successful in 1865. ''(Note: The [[Confederate States of America]] actually seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1860.)''

:8. We are cultural conservatives because we have certain morals to which we adhere. We are against homosexuality, vulgarity, loveless sex, and masochism. 

:9. We wish for American government to stop interfering politically, militarily, and socially outside of the borders of the United States of America. We want non-interventionism.<ref name="statement"></ref>

Host James Edwards has also described the show as "politically incorrect".<ref name="wmc6"/> Winston Smith has said, looking back, "[t]he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture."<ref name =eve/>

==Activism==
In 2005, the Cesspool staff organized a rally at Confederate Park in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The park had earlier come under criticism by a black [[Shelby County, Tennessee|county]] official, which attracted the notice of [[Al Sharpton]]. Sharpton planned a march from downtown Memphis to [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] Park, but he canceled the march after Edwards and the Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, which is located along Sharpton's planned march route. Sharpton settled for a protest at Forrest Park, which attracted a few dozen, mostly black demonstrators, whom Edwards referred to as "rabble". Edwards attracted about 200 white counter-demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil.<ref name=sewage/>

In 2007, James Edwards was part of a four-member panel that appeared on an episode of [[CNN]]'s now-discontinued ''[[Paula Zahn Now]]'' show, along with [[Roland S. Martin]] and [[Jesse Lee Peterson]]. The purpose of the panel was to discuss [[racial segregation|self-segregation]] in American cities. Edwards stated that "Whites are in for the fight of their lives",<ref name=sewage>{{cite news |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=817|title=Memphis Sewage|accessdate=April 28, 2009|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]: [[Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Intelligence_Report|Intelligence Report]]|date=Fall 2007|first=David|last=Holthouse}}</ref> and that white children should seek out those who share "the same values and traditions and heroes", and that "forced integration" was a "march toward totalitarianism". He criticized the [[American civil rights movement]] as "failed" and "cultural [[Marxism]]", and suggested that white liberals should "spend a week on the mean streets of South Memphis". [[Roland S. Martin]] denounced Edwards's remarks as "offensive" and unfit for national television.<ref name="spl798">{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=798|title=Into the Mainstream|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref>

== Awards ==

In 2005, Memphis city councilman E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Austin Farley (a then-co-host of the show who later left the staff in 2006 to run for the Tennessee House of Representatives, an election he ended up losing) with a certificate "in appreciation of outstanding contributions to the community". Jones also awarded Edwards and Farley with an honorary city council membership. Prior to this, Jones had been a featured guest on the show.<ref name=sewage/>

In the aftermath of the [[The_Political_Cesspool#Activism|city park controversy]], Cesspool affiliates James Edwards, Austin Farley, Jess Bonds, and Bill Rolen received the 'Dixie Defender Award' from the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]].<ref name=about/>

==Controversy and criticism==
''The Political Cesspool'' was added to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC)'s hate group watch list in 2006. James Edwards was "ecstatic", saying "I don't think you've arrived in the conservative movement until you've made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Watch". Edwards describes the SPLC as a group composed of "communists and civil rights hustlers".<ref name="wmc6"/>  As the SPLC has noted, Edwards has denounced [[Jews]], claiming that they "hate Christianity" and "are using [[pornography]] as a subversive tool against us". Edwards has also argued that mainstream [[Christianity]] has been infiltrated by "[[Zionist]] influence and perverse leftist ideology" since the [[1950s]].<ref name="spl423"> {{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=423|title=In His Own Words|accessdate=April 28, 2009}} </ref> The SPLC's [[Hatewatch]] has referred to ''The Political Cesspool'' as  "an overtly racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by [a] self-avowed white nationalist." <ref name="patstandard" />

Award-winning investigative journalist [[Max Blumenthal]], who reported on an attempt by a Political Cesspool staffer to advertise at a [[Sarah Palin]] rally, has described the show as having a "racist ideology", and highlighted anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog. James Edwards had written "Jews are the ones who are always speaking in code; when they use words like <U+2018>racists<U+2019>, <U+2018>bigots<U+2019>, <U+2018>anti-semites<U+2019>, they simply mean white people", "Hollywood promotes white [[genocide]]"<ref name="max2">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080901/blumenthal|title=Obama Nation Author Jerome Corsi's Racist History Exposed|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref>, <U+201C>For blacks in the Americas, slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to them.

The [[Stephen Roth Institute]] has also commented on the show, noting that "[James] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests<U+2019> views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] and the racist [[League of the South]], he gained the support of a wide array of extremists." <ref name="rothusa"> {{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2007/usa.html|title=Anti-Semitism in the United States|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref> It has also commented on the show's interview with [[Filip Dewinter]], a member of the [[Belgian Parliament]] who is a leader in that country's extremist [[Vlaams Belang]] movement.<ref name="rothbel"> {{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2007/belgium.html|title=Anti-Semitism in Belgium|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref>
