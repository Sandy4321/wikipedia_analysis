'''Dumat al-Jundal''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062F><U+0648><U+0645><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0646><U+062F><U+0644>}}), is the name for an ancient city of ruins located in North Western [[Saudi Arabia]] in the [[Al Jawf]] province. The name Dumat al-Jandal means literally "Dumah of the Stone", since this was the territory of [[Dumah (son of Ishmael)|Dumah]], one of the twelve sons of [[Ishmael]]. The city's ancient [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] name was ''Adummatu''. 

== Pre-Islamic History ==
The city has a history dating back to the  [[10th century BC]] and is mentioned in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] inscriptions of the [[Assyrian empire]] dating to 845 BC in which it is referred to as ''Adummatu'' and is described as the capital of an [[Arab]] kingdom, sometimes named as [[Qedar]] (''Qidri''). The names of five powerful Arab queens that ruled this city are known, among them [[Zabibe]], [[Samsi]], [[Tabua]] and [[Te'elhunu]]. The latter is also given the title of high priestess of [[Atarsamain]], a [[deity]] of fertility, love and war associated with [[Ishtar]]. Dumat al-Jundal was the site of an important temple dedicated to Ishtar.

Excavations made by Khaleel Ibrahim al-Muaikel in 1986 added to observations made in 1976 that an homogenous layer of [[Roman Empire|Roman]]-[[Nabataean]] pottery sherds indicating a prosperous community during the time of the Nabataeans to whom this realm of the region probably belonged.<ref name=DesertFrontier>Amir 'Abd al-Rahman bin Ahmad al-Sudairi, ''The Desert Frontier of Arabia, Al-Jawf through the Ages'', 1995, ISBN 0905743 75 X, p49</ref>

In 106 CE, Dumat was incorporated into the Roman Empire when the Emperor [[Trajan]] defeated the Nabataeans. In 269 CE, the place was mentioned by [[Zenobia]], the Queen of [[Palmyra]], as city with an immune fortress. After her forces had captured the city, the fortress of [[Marid Castle|Marid]] withstood the attack in her revolt against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Later in the 5th century CE, the city became the capital of the kingdom of [[Kindah]]. In 630 CE, [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] captured Dumat Al-Jandal and it became a part of the newly formed Islamic empire.
