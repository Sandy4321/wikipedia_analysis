'''Saviour Machine''' is an American [[Christian metal]] band that formed in 1989. They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through [[Massacre Records]]. Saviour Machine's music and lyrics deal with war, death, and personal introspection as it relates to prophecy and divine revelation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ankeny, Jason |title= Saviour Machine |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2004-02-04 |work=[[Allmusic]] |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p296142|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2008-09-12 }}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years (1989 - 1993)===
The band was formed by brothers Jeff and [[Eric Clayton]] in the summer of 1989. By the time of its first tour in 1993, the band was Eric Clayton - vocals, Jeff Clayton - guitars, Dean Forsyth - bass, Jayson Heart - drums, and Nathan Van Hala - keyboards. The band took its name from a song on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''. Saviour Machine recorded and released their first demos in 1990. A theatrical stage show featuring [[pyrotechnics]], images projected onto a background screen and other [[theatrical properties|props]] attracted a growing fan base in [[Southern California]].

|title="Legion"
|description=Sample of "Legion" by Saviour Machine, from ''[[Saviour Machine I]]'' (1993).  Containing lyrics with apocalyptic themes, this song eventually led to the album being banned from Christian bookstores in the United States.}}

In 1993, with the help of Deliverance frontman Jimmy P. Brown II, Saviour Machine signed with and released their first full-length album on Intense Records, an imprint of the Frontline subsidiary of [[Roadrunner Records]]. Musically, the band developed a [[guitar]]-driven [[Rock (music)|rock]] music sound, featuring melodic [[riffs]] and extensive [[solo (music)|solos]] by Jeff Clayton.

Despite critical acclaim from the mainstream press<ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title=Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine II |publisher=Open Publishing |year=2004 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/review.php?review_id=292&print_page=yes |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title= Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine I |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2004-02-04 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=1033&band_id=149&bandname=Saviour+Machine |accessdate=2007-09-09 }}</ref> and a growing number of fans nationwide, people in some conservative circles reportedly felt threatened by Saviour Machine's lyrical direction and stage presentation, most prominently the white make-up and jewel worn by vocalist Eric Clayton. During their 1993 tour with [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Deliverance (metal band)|Deliverance]], the controversy spilled over at a concert at the New Union, a club in [[Minneapolis]]. Several songs into their set, the power was cut and the performers were ushered from the stage. This was followed by an announcement from New Union management stating they were uncomfortable with the content of the show. However, many in the crowd gathered with the band shortly afterward at a local [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] restaurant to show their continued support.{{ref|1}}

===Studio transition (1994 - 1996)===
Confusion and political upheaval at Intense/Frontline led to less-than-ideal conditions for the recording of the band's next album in 1994, ''Saviour Machine II''. Musically, the addition of [[pianist]] Nathan Van Hala resulted in a [[european classical music|classical music]]-based sound.  Many songs featured [[piano]] compositions and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[orchestration]]. Charles Cooper also joined the band at this time after Dean Forsyth left.

With the release of ''Saviour Machine II'' the band began to pursue new representation. A growing following had developed in [[Europe]], particularly in [[Germany]]. This led to the formation of MCM Music, an independent label for all Saviour Machine projects, by vocalist Eric Clayton and his European management team. The band also secured a deal with [[Massacre Records]], a German label that specializes in death metal and other heavy/extreme music. Saviour Machine was given full creative control on all future projects.

Multiple tours of [[Europe]] followed in 1995 and 1996. During a 1995 performance at Owen Teck Rocknight, a [[music festival]] in Owen, [[Germany]], Saviour Machine recorded their first live album. ''Live in Deutschland'', released in 1995, featured selections from ''Saviour Machine I'' and ''Saviour Machine II''. It was after this tour that the membership of Saviour Machine changed with the replacement of Jeff Clayton by Joshua. They performed at [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in 1997.

===The ''Legend'' trilogy (1997 - 2007)===
Saviour Machine next turned to the ''Legend'' trilogy. ''Legend'' was advertised as "the unofficial soundtrack to the end of the world" in promotional materials<ref name="HM_97_65"/> owing to its study of [[end times|end-time]] [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]]. The ''Legend'' trilogy comprises four full-length CDs totaling more than five hours of music. ''Legend I'' and ''Legend II'' were released in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The studio composition of the band stayed the same through "Legend II" after which Jeff Clayton and Jayson Heart left the band. ''[[Legend III:I]]'' was released in 2001. The long-awaited final disc, ''Legend III:II'', was scheduled to be released July 7, 2007. ''Legend'' parts ''I'' through ''III:I'' were released by MCM Music and Massacre Records; however, ''Legend III:II'' was released independently.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sound7.de/article.php?channel=3&article=4154 |title= Eric Clayton im Interview |accessdate= 2007-12-04 |author= Brunner, David |date= 11.08.2006 |work= Sound7.de |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> On May 27, 2007, Eric Clayton released a statement on the Saviour Machine MySpace blog saying that, due to health problems, he would not be able to finish ''Legend III:II'' in time to make the July 7 release date. He released samples of rough mixes of each song on ''Legend III:II'' on SeventhCircle.net throughout July.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.seventhcircle.net/legend.htm |title= ''Legend Part III:II'' |accessdate= 2007-12-04 |author= Clayton, Eric |date= 2007-07-07 |work= Sound7.de |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Most of the lyrical content of the ''Legend'' series is based on the [[Book of Revelation]] and other [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]].<ref name="HM_97_65"/> The first album draws from the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]], except the [[Book of Revelation]], and include biblical references and a [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]].<ref name="HM_97_65">{{cite journal |last=Macintosh |first=Dan |date=May<U+2013>June 1997 |title=Saviour Machine |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |issn=1066-6923 |issue=65 |pages= |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/archives/Saviour+Machine.htm |accessdate=2007-04-30 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20000918053800/http://www.hmmagazine.com/archives/Saviour+Machine.htm |archivedate= 2000-09-18 }}</ref> ''Legend II'' continues where part one ended - the rise of the [[antichrist]].<ref name="HM_97_65"/> Musically, the ''Legend'' albums showcase a further refinement of Saviour Machine's [[Rock (music)|rock]] and [[european classical music|classical music]] style.

Saviour Machine has performed a limited number of concerts in the US, Germany and [[Mexico City]] since undertaking the ''Legend'' trilogy. A second live album was released in 2002, again featuring a performance from Owen Teck Rocknight in Owen, Germany. ''Live in Deutschland 2002'' featured selections from ''Legend I'', ''Legend II'' and ''Legend III:I''.

===Current status===
Eric Clayton has repeatedly stated that Saviour Machine's work will end upon the completion of the ''Legend'' trilogy. In a video message created on September 3, 2009, Eric stated that despite his frail health he is doing quite well and plans to release segments from a journal he has been keeping since 1997. He said that the excerpts will likely serve as his final interview.<ref>[http://www.saviourmachine.com Saviour Machine Home Page - A Message From Eric Clayton]</ref>
