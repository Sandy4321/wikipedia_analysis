The '''Smith Gun''' was an ''ad hoc'' anti-tank artillery piece used by the [[British Army]] and [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] during the [[Second World War]]. With a [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]] of [[Great Britain]] seeming likely after the defeat in the [[Battle of France]] most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Smith Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]].

The weapon consisted of a 3-inch smoothbore barrel approximately 54 inches long mounted on a carriage and capable of firing both anti-tank and anti-personnel rounds to ranges of approximately 500 yards. Despite the promising-sounding nature of the weapon it had several problems; the effective range was only around 100-300 yards, it was a heavy and awkward weapon to move around and it developed "a terrifying reputation for killing its crew."<ref name=macb/> Production issues meant that it was not introduced until 1942, when it was issued mainly to Home Guard units and those units in the regular Army tasked with guarding airfields, and ammunition shortages meant that the guns had only six or seven rounds each. Despite these problems many Home Guard units developed an attachment to the weapon, later claiming it was "one of the best pieces of equipment ever issued to the force."<ref name=macc/>

==Development==

With the end of the [[Battle of France]] and the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force]] from [[Dunkirk evacuation|the port of Dunkirk]] between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German [[Operation Sealion|invasion]] of [[Great Britain]] seemed likely.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 20</ref> However, the [[British Army]] was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions.<ref name="Lampe3">Lampe, p. 3</ref> The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in [[France]] and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.<ref name="Lampe3" /> 

Given these shortcomings, what weapons were left were allocated to the British Army, and the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] was forced to supplement the meagre amount of weapons and ammunition they had with ''ad hoc'' weapons.<ref>Mackenzie, pp. 91-92</ref> The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox' origin, like many of the other weapons that were produced for use by the Home Guard during the conflict. It was invented by retired British Army [[Major]] William H. Smith, the director of a [[civil engineering]] company that produced toys, and was intended to be a cheap and easily-manufactured anti-tank weapon.<ref>Mackenzie, pp. 120-121</ref> The weapon design was submitted to the Ordnance Board, who were unconvinced with its merits, but the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], witnessed a demonstration of the weapon in 1941 and ordered that it be put into production.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref>

==Design==

The Smith Gun consisted of a 3 inch calibre smoothbore barrel,<ref>Mackenzie, p. 120</ref> 54 inches in length,<ref>Kinard, p. 270</ref> which was mounted on a carriage which looked "like a two-wheeled baby carriage"<ref>Mackenzie, p. 120</ref> and weighed approximately 604 pounds.<ref>Kinard, p. 270</ref> The weapon had an unusual firing procedure, in which it was actually tipped over onto one wheel, this acting a baseplate and thereby allowing the Smith Gun to be rotated 360 degrees with a 40 degree elevation. It was light enough that it could be towed behind a civilian vehicle.<ref>Kinard, p. 270</ref> The Smith Gun was able to fire both anti-personnel or anti-tank rounds, with the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour at that range. Fletcher claims that it had a range of approximately 500 yards,<ref>Fletcher, p. 41</ref> although Mackenzie states that it had an effective range of only between 100-300 yards, and was also inaccurate.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref> The weapon was found to have several flaws in its design, and as such was not well-liked by some of the Home Guard units that it was issued to. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle and had a low muzzle velocity; and due to the initial supply of rounds possessing faulty fuses it came to have "a terrifying reputation for killing its crew."<ref name=macb>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref>

==Operational history==

Production on the Smith Guns began in late 1941, but problems with their production meant that it was not until mid-1942 that the first batch of 4,000 were delivered to the Home Guard; by the beginning of 1943, a total of 3,049 Smith Guns had been issued to Home Guard units.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref> Production problems also affected the ammunition for the weapons; a delay in producing anti-tank ammunition meant that each weapon was only supplied with six or seven rounds.<ref>Mackenzie, p. 136</ref> A number of Smith Guns were also issued to regular army units tasked with guarding airfields,<ref>Kinard, p. 270</ref> and one was even mounted onto a [[Bren Carrier]], although this prototype did not go into production.<ref>Fletcher, pp. 40-41</ref> Despite the problems with the weapon, and its tendency to injure or even kill those who manned it, the government attempted to portray it in a positive light, issuing special instructions in the autumn of 1942 which stated that the Smith Gun was a "...simple, powerful and accurate weapon which, if properly handled, will add greatly to the firepower of the Home Guard." After a period of initial distrust, many Home Guard units appear to have taken to the Smith Gun and attempted to make the best use of it. Mackenzie states that some units even had 'a growing sense of affection for the weapon' and describes how, when a letter was published in [[The Times]] towards the end of the conflict criticizing the weapon, numerous Home Guard volunteers replied with their own letters describing how satisfactory the Smith Gun had been and stating that it was "one of the best pieces of equipment ever issued to the force."<ref name=macc>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref> No Smith Guns were used in active service, and they were declared to be obselete in 1945.<ref>Kinard, p. 270</ref>
