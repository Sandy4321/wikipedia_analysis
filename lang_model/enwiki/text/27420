"'''Spit Your Game'''" is the second single by [[Notorious B.I.G]] from his ''[[Duets: The Final Chapter]]'' album, a remixed album of Biggie Smalls' work. The song features guest appearances from [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]]'s [[Krayzie Bone]] and [[Twista]] and sampled Walter Jackson's "My Ship Is Coming In". The single is a [[double A-side]] with "[[Hold Ya Head]]", a song which samples [[Bob Marley]].

The single was released on 24 April in the UK [http://www.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;-1;-1;-1&sku=501436] and reached #64 in the UK charts.[http://www.polyhex.com]

It is a modern rendition of Notorious B.I.G's and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's acclaimed collaboration on the song "[[Notorious Thugs]]". In "Notorious Thugs" Biggie changed his normally smooth flow to a faster melodic pace to emulate Bone's trademark flow and "Spit Your Game" references this by including two fast verses by Twista and Krayzie Bone.

==Video==
The video for "Spit Your Game" features [[Layzie Bone]], [[Wish Bone]], [[Krayzie Bone]], [[Twista]], [[Eightball & MJG]] and [[Swizz Beatz]]. It is set in a recording studio as a "Battle for the Krown" is taking place.

On the airing of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Making the Video]]'' episode for "Spit Your Game", it was announced that this will be the last video ever to be in dedication of The Notorious B.I.G. [[Yung Joc]], [[Jody Breeze]], [[Big Gee]], [[Layzie Bone]], [[Wish Bone]], [[Swizz Beatz]] & [[Sleepy Brown]] made an appearance on the video

==Remixes==
"Spit Your Game" is a remix of "[[Notorious Thugs]]", a Notorious B.I.G. and [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]] duet on Biggie's second, diamond album ''[[Life After Death]]''.

The song also features a remixed version, where [[8ball & MJG]] split a verse each towards the end of the song, though their verses have been much criticized for not keeping in context with fast rapping and doing basic slow verses. This remix will be on the compilation ''[[We Invented the Remix Vol. 2]]''.
