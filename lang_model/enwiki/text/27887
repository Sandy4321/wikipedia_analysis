'''Leon Theodore "Lee" Silver''' (born April 9, 1925), Professor of Geology at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), was an instructor to the [[Apollo 13]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]] astronaut crews. Working with the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]], he taught astronauts how to perform field geology, essentially creating lunar field geology as a new discipline. His training is credited with a significant improvement in the J-Mission Apollo flights' scientific returns. After the [[Apollo program]], he became a member of the United States [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1974. Currently, he is the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] Professor for Resource Geology, [[emeritus]], at Caltech.

==Early life and education==
Leon Silver was born in [[Monticello, New York]] on April 9, 1925 as the youngest of five children.<ref name= "silver1">Cohen, pp. ii-iii</ref> His parents were Russian and Polish immigrants of Jewish origin who moved the family to [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] soon after he was born. He graduated from [[Crosby High School (Waterbury, Connecticut)|Crosby High School]] in 1942.<ref name= "silver1"/>

He earned his BS in Civil Engineering at the [[University of Colorado]], [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], in 1945; an MS in Geology at the [[University of New Mexico]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] in 1948; and a Ph.D. in Geology and Geochemistry at [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Pasadena, California]], in 1955.

==Career==

===Early career===
Silver served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1943 to 1946, where he attained the rank of [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in the [[Civil Engineer Corps]]. He worked for the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), Mineral Deposits Branch, in [[Colorado]] and [[Arizona]] from 1947 to 1954 (field seasons only), where he attained the status of Assistant Geologist.

===Academic career===
After completing his Ph.D., Silver was appointed Assistant Professor of Geology (1955<U+2013>1962) at Caltech; he was later promoted to Associate Professor (1962<U+2013>1965), Professor (1965<U+2013>1983), and [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] Professor for Resource Geology (1983<U+2013>1996), where he is now a professor emeritus since his retirement.<ref name=Caltechbio/>

His main research interests are [[petrology]], [[plate tectonics|tectonics]], and applications of geology and [[isotope geochemistry]] to [[geochronology]], crustal evolution, [[ore deposit]]s, and comparative [[planetology]].<ref name=Caltechbio>{{cite web|title=Leon T. Silver|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/lsilver/profile|work=Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=2011-09-09|location=Pasadena|year=2011 }}</ref> While pursuing these research interests, Silver also played a major role in the Apollo Program's lunar geological exploration as well as on numerous national scientific advisory boards and committees.<ref name=Drexler/>

===NASA and Apollo Program involvement===
NASA's [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] Oral History Project lists Silver's involvement as follows:<ref name=NASAbio>Butler (2002)</ref>

*Geologist, [[Astrogeology Research Program|Astrogeology Branch]] of the [[U.S. Geological Survey|USGS]], (1970<U+2013>1976, part-time), contracted to work with NASA
*Geology Lecturer to NASA Scientist-Astronaut Classes, Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Texas (Part Time 1968-1993)
*Lunar Surface Geology Experiment Team (Apollo 13-17)
*Lunar Sample Preliminary Examination Team (Apollo 15-17)
*Lunar Surface Traverse Planning Team (Apollo 15-17)
*Lunar Science Working Panel (Apollo 15-17)
*Lunar Sample Analysis Planning Team, Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Texas (1972<U+2013>1974)
*Space Program Advisory Council Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Scientist-Astronauts (1974<U+2013>1975)

==In popular culture==
Silver's work with the Apollo Program has been recounted, perhaps most notably, in [[Andrew Chaikin]]'s ''[[A Man on the Moon]]'' (1994).<ref>Chaikin (1994)</ref>  The book became a TV mini-series in 1998, with [[David Clennon]] portraying him in the [[HBO]] docu-drama series ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From The Earth To The Moon]]''.<ref name=Drexler/> In the series' Episode 10 "Galileo Was Right", Silver is shown teaching the Apollo 15 astronauts field geology, and participating from Houston's Mission Control in their lunar extra-vehicular activities (Moonwalks).<ref name=Drexler>Drexler (1999)</ref> Silver was interviewed about the episode and he felt that it "romanticized" the experience, and had minor historical inaccuracies, but otherwise liked it and showed it at a lecture in 1999.<ref name=Drexler/>

In 2002, Apollo 15 Commander [[David Scott]] devoted a section of his co-authored book ''Two Sides of the Moon'' to the training and instruction that Scott and other Apollo astronauts received from Silver.<ref name="ScottLen">Scott & Leonov (2002)</ref>

==Personal==
Leon Silver is a board member of the [[Caswell Silver Foundation]] at the University of New Mexico. The Foundation was created in 1980 through an endowment by Caswell Silver, an alumnus of the Department of Geology, independent oilman, and Leon Silver's brother.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Ashburn  | first = Nolan   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Memorial to Caswell Silver 1916<U+2013>1988  | journal = Memorials, v. 29, December 1998    | volume = 29  | format = PDF | publisher = Geological Society of America  | location = Boulder, Colorado  |date=December 1998 |url =ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v29/silver.pdf |accessdate = 2011-09-09}}</ref> The Foundation supports education and research at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico.<ref name=CasSilverFnd>{{cite journal|last=Ashcraft|first=Ellen K.|title=Caswell Silver Foundation is Sterling|journal=Developments|year=2002|issue=Spring 2002|url=http://www.unm.edu/foundation/newsletter/spring02caswell.htm|publisher=University of New Mexico|location=Albuquerque| accessdate=2011-09-09 }}</ref>

His grandnephew is statistician and journalist [[Nate Silver]].

==Honors and awards==
* In 1971 Silver was awarded a NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal both for his training of Apollo astronauts in geologic science and equally for his research: <blockquote>For his significant scientific achievements in the development of highly precise isotopic compositions of uranium and lead in minerals and the applications of the age determination procedures in the analyses of lunar material. While diligently conducting these laboratory investigations of lunar material, he provided a major contribution by training the astronauts in geological sciences which, through his enthusiasm, leadership and guidance, has led to the successful exploration of the moon.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = |title = Leon Silver Receives NASA Medal | journal = The California Tech | volume =  LXXIII | issue = 10 | pages =
