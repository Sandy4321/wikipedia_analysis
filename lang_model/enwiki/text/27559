==History==
In 1925, the institution changed its names to ''Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science'', and as an agricultural school, its teams were referred to as the Aggies. Looking to move beyond its agricultural roots, Michigan State held a contest to find a new nickname. They decided to call the teams the "Michigan Staters". Local sports writers for the [[Lansing State Journal]] and the Capital News went through the losing entries to find a shorter and more heroic name. They decided on the "[[Spartan Army|Spartans]]". By coincidence, Justin Morrill had once compared the Land Grant colleges to the schools of ancient Sparta. With a heroic name and a historic precedent, the "Spartans" quickly caught on as the teams' new nickname. Within a few years, the College changed the lyrics of the [[Michigan State University Fight Song|Fight Song]] to reflect the name change of the College and its sports teams.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://newsroom.msu.edu/snav/184/page.htm|title=MSU Facts |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] }}</ref>

As the college grew in size, it looked to join a major collegiate conference. When the [[University of Chicago]] eliminated varsity [[football]] and withdrew from the Western Conference (now the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]) in 1946, Michigan State president [[John A. Hannah]] lobbied hard to take its place. The Big Ten finally admitted M.S.C. in 1949.<ref name="sports history" /> After joining the conference, head [[American football|football]] coach [[Biggie Munn|Clarence L. "Biggie" Munn]] led the Spartan football team to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in the 1953<U+2013>54 season, beating [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] 28&ndash;20.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/yearly_results.php?year=1953|title=1953 Season Bowl Games|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse}}</ref> Successor coach [[Duffy Daugherty|Hugh "Duffy" Daugherty]] carried the football team to a second Rose Bowl where it again defeated UCLA, 17&ndash;14.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/yearly_results.php?year=1955|title=1955 Season Bowl Games|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse}}</ref>

===Football===
{{main|Michigan State Spartans football|2008 Michigan State Spartans football team}}
[[American football|Football]] has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grinczel, Steve. | title=They Are Spartans | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2003 | isbn= 0-7385-3214-2|pages=9}}</ref> Michigan State is often referred to the country's "football factory", especially during the 1950s when Detroit was the world's leading automobile manufacturer. During that time, the Spartans had a roster of impressive players, including Lynn Chandnois, Dorne Dibble, and Don McAulliffe. In 1951, the Spartans finished the season undefeated, and performed the same feat the following year in addition to the nation's longest winnig streak of 24 games. The team was named the "undisputed national champions by every official poll".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://www.helmethut.com/College/MichState/MSU.html|title=Michigan State |publisher=Helmut Hut }}</ref>

After waiting for several years, the team was finally admitted into the Big 10 as a regular member in 1953. They promptly went on to capture the league championship (losing only one game during the season) and beating UCLA in their first Rose Bowl game. After the 1953 season [[Biggie Munn]], the legendary Spartan coach, turned the team over to his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> and future legend [[Duffy Daugherty]].   He won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1954 and 1956. George Perles was the head coach when the Spartans defeated USC in the Rose Bowl in January of 1988.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://www.stubhub.com/michigan-state-football-tickets/|title=Michigan State Spartans Football Tickets |publisher=[[StubHub]] }}</ref> All told, Michigan State has won or shared six national championships (1951, 1952, 1955, 1957, 1965 and 1966) and nine Big Ten championships.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-31|url=http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rfsc/history/kirlin/champs.html|title=Historical Reality National College Football Champions |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]|author=Kirlin, Bob }}</ref>
