'''Lake Kariba''' is the world's largest artificial [[lake]] and [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] by volume.  It lies 1300 kilometers upstream from the [[Indian Ocean]], along the border between [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].  Lake Kariba was filled between 1958 and 1963 following the completion of the [[Kariba Dam]] at its northeastern end, flooding the [[Kariba Gorge]] on the [[Zambezi River]].

The Zimbabwean town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]] was built for construction workers on the lake's [[dam]], while some other settlements such as [[Binga village]] and [[Mlibizi]] in Zimbabwe and [[Siavonga]] and [[Sinazongwe]] in Zambia have grown up to house people displaced by the rising waters.

==Physical characteristics==
Lake Kariba is over 223 kilometers (140&nbsp;mi) long and up to 40 kilometers (20&nbsp;mi) in width.  It covers an area of 5,580 square kilometers (2,150 sq mi) and its storage capacity is an immense 185 cubic kilometers (44.4 cu mi).  The mean depth of the lake is 29 meters (95&nbsp;ft); the maximum depth is 97 meters (320&nbsp;ft). It is the world's largest human-made reservoir, four times as large as the [[Three Gorges Dam]].<ref>{{cite web

The lake has several [[island]]s, including Maaze Island, Mashape Island, [[Chete Island]], [[Sekula Island|Sekula]], [[Sampa Karuma]], [[Fothergill island|Fothergill]], [[Spurwing]], Snake Island, Antelope Island, [[Bed Island]], and [[Chikanka]].

==Ecology==
[[Image:KaribaDam.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Kariba Dam]]]]
Before Lake Kariba was filled, the existing vegetation was burned, creating a thick layer of fertile soil on land that would become the lake bed.  As a result the [[ecology]] of Lake Kariba is vibrant.  A number of [[fish]] species have been introduced to the lake, notably the [[sardine]]-like [[kapenta]] (transported from [[Lake Tanganyika]]), which now supports a thriving commercial [[fishery]].  Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include [[Nile crocodile]]s and [[hippopotamus]].

Gamefish, particularly [[Hydrocynus|tigerfish]], which was among the indigenous species of the Zambezi river system, now thrive on the kapenta, which in turn encourages [[tourism]].  Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are now attempting to develop the tourism industry along their respective coasts of Lake Kariba.

[[African fish eagle|Fish eagles]], [[cormorant]]s and other water birds patrol the shorelines, as do occasional herds of [[African elephant|elephant]]s.

==Protected areas==
The portion of Lake Kariba which falls within Zimbabwe has been designated a [[List of national parks of Zimbabwe#Current Recreational Parks|Recreational Park]] within the [[Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate]].
