The '''Federal Aviation Act of 1958''' was an [[Act of Congress]] that created the Federal Aviation Agency (later the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] or the FAA) and abolished its predecessor, the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration]]. <ref>http://www.hometravelagency.com/dictionary/federal-aviation-act.html</ref> The act empowered the FAA to oversee and regulate safety in the airline industry and the use of American airspace by both [[civilian]] [[aircraft]] and [[military]] aircraft.

==Background==
The [[Department of Commerce]] had regulated the airline industry for the 1920s and most of the 1930s. In 1938, Congress passed a law creating the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] that performed the same functions the Department of Commerce had.

A boom in the 1950s of aircraft technology and the [[airline industry|aviation industry]] crowded American airspace and it made it more difficult for the government to effectively regulate air traffic. This led to a series of plane accidents that prompted the creation of this bill.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/federal-aviation-act-1958</ref>

On the morning of June 30, 1956, [[United Flight 718]] collided with [[TWA Flight 2]] over the [[Grand Canyon]], resulting in 128 [[fatalities]]. It was the greatest air tragedy at the time. This high profile accident raised public concern for airline safety.<ref>http://doney.net/aroundaz/grandcanyoncrash.htm</ref>  In 1957 Congress passed the [[Airways Modernization Act]] that established the [[Airways Modernization Board]] (AMB) headed by General [[Elwood Quesada]].<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/federal-aviation-act-1958</ref>

In 1958, a further accident between a [[military aircraft|military jet]] and a [[commercial airliner]] showed the need for a unified commercial and military airspace command. <ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580520-1</ref> The day after the Brunswick collision a version of the Federal Aviation Act was introduced in Congress.

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the bill into law on August 23, 1958, appointed AMB Chairman Quesada the first FAA Administrator. <ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/federal-aviation-act-1958</ref>
