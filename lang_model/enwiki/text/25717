'''"Out from Under"''' is a song by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]], taken from her sixth [[studio album]], ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008). The song was written by [[Shelly Peiken]], Arnthor Birgisson, and [[Wayne Hector]], initially for [[Bratz: Motion Picture Soundtrack|the soundtrack of ''Bratz: The Movie'']], featuring vocals of American recording artist [[Joanna Pacitti]]. After approaching Spears and [[Guy Sigsworth]] in 2008, the songwriters suggested the singer to re-record the song for her album. "Out from Under" is a [[soft rock]] song that alludes to the ending of Spears' marriage with [[Kevin Federline]], and blends the singer's breathy vocals with acoustic guitars in the background.

Despite not being released as a single, "Out from Under" managed to peak at number nineteen on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]], following the release of ''Circus'', and at number thirty-two in Sweden. The song was featured on the fifth season of [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Hills]]''.
