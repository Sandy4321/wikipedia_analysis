The '''Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident''' ({{zh|t=<U+5929><U+5B89><U+9580><U+81EA><U+711A><U+4E8B><U+4EF6>|s=<U+5929><U+5B89><U+95E8><U+81EA><U+711A><U+4E8B><U+4EF6>}}) took place in [[Tiananmen Square]], an historic and iconic part of central Beijing, on the eve of [[Chinese new year]] on 23 January 2001. The incident is disputed: according to the official Chinese press agency, [[Xinhua News Agency]], five members of [[Falun Gong]], a banned but popular [[new religious movement]] based on [[meditation]] which was also known as "Falun Dafa", set themselves on fire to protest the perceived unfair treatment of Falun Gong by the Chinese government; however, the Falun Dafa Information Center denied that the [[Self-immolation|self-immolators]] were practitioners,<ref name="FDI_PressRelease"/> on the grounds that the movement's teachings explicitly forbid suicide and killing.<ref name="TheIssueOfKilling">{{cite web |url=http://falundafa.org/book/eng/zfl_new_7.html#1 |title=The Issue of Killing |first=Hongzhi |last=Li |work=[[Zhuan Falun]] |publisher=Falun Dafa}}</ref> 

The five people were part of a group of seven who had traveled to the square together. One of them, Liu Chunling, died at Tiananmen and another, her 12-year-old daughter, Liu Siying, died in hospital several weeks later; three survived.

==Background==
{{seealso|Persecution of Falun Gong}}
[[Falun Gong]], a [[new religious movement]] based on the meditative practice of ''[[qigong]]'', was founded in the People's Republic of China by [[Li Hongzhi]] in 1992, and has attracted millions of followers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2004/10/8/53286.html |title=A Chronicle of Major Historic Events during the Introduction of Falun Dafa to the Public |publisher=Clearwisdom.net |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> When its teachings, influenced by [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]],<ref name="pennyharrold">{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html|title=The Past, Present, and Future of Falun Gong|last=Penny|first=Benjamin|date=2001|accessdate=2009-10-06|quote=The best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system.

Following the ban, [[Tiananmen Square]], which has been the central point for [[Tiananmen Square protests|several major historical protests]], was one of the prime locations where the Falun Gong leadership expected practitioners to demonstrate despite government deterrence, and by 25 April 2000, one year later, more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464 |title=Defiant Falun Dafa Members Converge on Tiananmen |first=Ian |last=Johnson |date=25 April 2000 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Pulitzer.org |page= A21}}</ref> Seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the Square on 1 January 2001.<ref name="Perry">{{cite book  |first=Elizabeth J. |last=Selden |coauthor=Perry, Mark |title=Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |ISBN=041530170X}}</ref> According to ''Time'', a Falun Gong website editorial instructed followers to step up demonstrations, "especially in Tiananmen Square"; founder [[Li Hongzhi]] urged followers to immobilize the police and other "evil scoundrels" through use of supernatural powers.<ref name=breakingpoint>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Forney |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,165163,00.html |title=The Breaking Point |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 June 2001}}</ref> Jensen and Weston (2006) noticed a marked change in the tone of Li Hongzhi's messages following the ban: practitioners who remained steadfast against the oppression would survive the apocalypse while those who succumbed to pressure would not.

Li understandably felt compelled to explain the disaster that had befallen him and his followers, and he did so by highlighting the apocalyptic messages that, prior to April 1999, had been a relatively minor part of his discourse: the CCP's campaign against Falun Gong was now presented as part of a "final test" leading up to the destruction and renewal of the world. Those practitioners who passed the test{{ndash}}by remaining steadfast in their resolve{{ndash}}would remain part of the elite destined to survive the apocalypse, while hose who crumbled in the face of pressure might not. Those who suffered or died for their beliefs, moreover, were offered the promise of instant "consummation" (or enlightenment). Li's speeches during this period are rather dense and lend themselves to different interpretations (Falun Gong practitioners in North America often meet to discuss Li's speeches in the hopes of coming to a common understanding), but it seems clear that he encouraged those FG practitioners who chose martyrdom over prudence. If the Chinese authorities clearly lit the fire, Li Hongzhi just as clearly fanned the flames. 

Such flames became all too deadly in 2001, when a number of Falun Gong practitioners apparently set themselves on fire at Tiananmen Square on January 23, resulting in five deaths. This incident remains highly disputed, FG practitioners and spokesman insisting that the event was staged by Chinese officials (who long refused, for example, to allow Western journalists to interview those who had survived their own attempted self-immolation though it would seem that such interviews would have been a golden opportunity for China to illustrate that FG "drives people crazy").}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Li writing in one piece: "Any fear is itself a barrier that prevents you from reaching consummation."<ref>{{cite news |title=Falun Gong Deaths Set Off Dispute on Suicide Report |first=Craig S. |last=Smith |work=The New York Times |date=4 July 2001}}</ref>

On 1 January 2001, Li published "''Beyond the Limits of Forbearance''", in which he wrote that persecution of the ''Fa''&nbsp;<U+2013> an expression used by Falun Gong to describe itself&nbsp;<U+2013> by "evil"&nbsp;<U+2013> meaning the [[Chinese Communist Party]]&nbsp;<U+2013> could no longer be tolerated: "Forbearance [as taught by [[Buddha]]] does not mean tolerating evil beings.

==Reporting==
The Chinese authorities stated that the seven people who had come to Tiananmen Square with the intention of committing suicide were all from the city of [[Kaifeng]] in [[Henan|Henan province]]. The state-run Xinhua News Agency asserted that the self-immolators were "avid practitioners" of Falun Gong who had taken up the practice between 1994 and 1997, and that they fantasised during the preceding week about "how wonderful it would be to enter heaven".<ref name=xinhua1/> Six of them reportedly took the train on 16 January, meeting Chen Guo, the daughter of one of them, upon their arrival in Beijing. The seven agreed to light themselves in different parts of the Square at 2:30 pm with gasoline smuggled there in plastic soda bottles; each had been armed with two lighters in case one would fail.<ref name=xinhua1>{{cite web |author=Xinhua |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/7474.htm |title=The Tragedy of Falun Gong Practitioners- Rescue: Doctors, Nurses Rush to Save Life |publisher=China.org.cn |date=31 January 2001 |accessdate= 1 August 2007}}</ref> According to the  China Association For Cultic Studies website, Wang Jindong stated afterwards that the group arrived in Tiananmen Square by two taxis, and were dropped off at the south of the [[Great Hall of the People]], from where they walked to the spot where they would ignite themselves.

==Falun Gong and self-immolation==
Falun Gong stated that there had been no incidents of self-immolation among Falun Gong practitioners in the world before 23 January 2001. However, the Chinese government-sanctioned China Association for Cultic Studies published details of 3 instances of Falun Gong followers who they claim committed self-immolation prior to 2001, the earliest one in 1997, and 3 further instances said to have taken place subsequent to the incident in Tiananmen Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facts.org.cn/Feature/hand/Cases/200904/t90507.htm |title=Self-immolation |author= China Association For Cultic Studies |publisher=facts.org |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> Academics such as Chang (1991), Rahn (2001), Lindsey (2001) and Li Cheng (1997) recognised that suicide is a traditional gesture of protest in China;<ref name=Porter/> ter Haar (2001) postulated that former Buddhists may have brought with them the "respectable Buddhist tradition of self-immolation as a sacrifice to the Buddha".<ref name="Haar">{{cite web |last=Haar |first=Barend ter |url=http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext2.html |title=Part One: Introductory remarks |publisher=Barend ter Haar, Leiden University |date=2001 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

''The Guardian'' commented that [[Li Hongzhi]]'s "new scripture" released on 1 January 2001, ''Beyond the Limits of Forbearance'', had confused his supporters.<ref name="gittings"/>  Matthew Forney in ''Time'' magazine believed the message had spread into China via the internet and informal networks of followers, and reached more radical practitioners there.<ref name=breakingpoint/> Falun Gong headquarters in New York admitted ten days after the release of the scripture that "certain disciples had some extreme interpretations [and thought] we are going to resort to violence"; Falun Gong asserted that Li's message merely meant time had come to let the truth be known about China's atrocities.<ref name="gittings" /> Jensen and Weston remarked it was clear from Li Hongzhi's messages that he advocated martyrdom over prudence, and that "if the Chinese authorities lit the fire, Li just as clearly fanned the flames."<ref name=jensenweston/> David Ownby, a leading Falun Gong scholar, wrote in his book ''Falun Gong and the future of China'' that the brief message was "difficult to interpret": it somewhat resembled a "call to arms" against what Li described as "evil beings who no longer have any human nature or righteous thoughts", but nobody Ownby talked to had seen it as a "green light" for violent action.<ref name=ownbyfalungong>{{cite book |first=David |last=Ownby |title=Falun Gong and the future of China |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2008 |pages= 215<U+2013>216}}</ref>

==The dispute==
Following the incident, the details of why the individuals were involved has been and remains the subject of dispute between representatives of Falun Gong, the Chinese government, and other observers. According to the Hong Kong NGO [[Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy]], all of the would-be self-immolators, except 12-year-old Liu Siying, had previously protested for Falun Gong in Tiananmen Square.<ref name=oneway/> Xinhua News Agency reported that Huo Xiuzhen, Liu Chunling's adoptive mother, spoke of her daughter's "obsession with Falun Gong", her "worshipping of Li Hongzhi", and how Liu would teach her daughter Falun Gong.<ref>{{cite web |author=Xinhua |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/7490.htm |title=Families of Falun Gong Victims After Tragedy |publisher=china.org.cn |date=1 February 2001}}</ref> Liu's neighbours interviewed by the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' (IHT) stated that she was not a native of Kaifeng, worked in a nightclub, and beat her mother and daughter.

Doubts about strident practitioners of Falun Gong revolved around the use of suicide as a form of protest, as the beliefs of Falun Gong forbid it. The Falun Dafa Information Center said, "Mr. Li Hongzhi ... has explicitly stated that suicide is a sin."<ref name="FDI_PressRelease">{{cite web |url=http://www.clearwisdom.net/eng/2001/jan/23/vsf012301_3.html |title=Press Statement |publisher=Falun Dafa Information Center |publisher=Clearwisdom |date=23 January 2001 |accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Falun-Gong-related commentators pointed out that the main participants' account of the incident and other aspects of the participants' behaviour were inconsistent with the teachings of Falun Dafa.<ref name=WOIPFG2/> The Laogai Research Foundation, founded by Chinese dissident [[Harry Wu]], suggested that an event "staged or allowed to happen by China's government in order to discredit the Falun Gong" was "hardly a far-fetched hypothesis."<ref name=laogai>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/commentprint021301a.html

CNN reported that four of the self-immolators were seen in flames, with their hands held "in a classic Falun Gong meditation pose", drawing a complaint from the Falun Gong movement.<ref name="gittings"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that a Beijing arm of Falun Gong strongly suggested the self-immolators were practitioners, yet the Falun Dafa Association in New York categorically denied the incident had anything to do with its practitioners.<ref name=time20010129>{{cite web |first=Hannah |last=Beech |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,97124,00.html |title=Too Hot to Handle |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=29 January 2001 |accessdate= 9 February 2007}}</ref> Francesco Sisci, Asia editor of ''[[La Stampa]]'', wrote in the ''[[Asia Times]]'': "the sect first tried to deny the episode and then argued that it was staged by the government.

''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that conflicting claims were still difficult to assess "[w]ith propaganda streaming in from seemingly opposite ends of the universe ... especially since the remaining Falun Gong practitioners have been driven underground." It noted however that one of the self-immolators was able to "fluidly perform" Falun Gong's signature slow-motion exercises in front of Western media.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elisabeth |last=Rosenthal |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/world/former-falun-gong-followers-enlisted-in-china-s-war-on-sect.html |title=Former Falun Gong Followers Enlisted in China's War on Sect |work=[[New York Times]] |date=5 April 2002}}</ref> Sisci commented that the police committed a mistake by seizing journalists at Tiananmen&nbsp;<U+2013> "independently filmed news footage of the proceedings could have been the best proof of Falungong madness. Instead, when the government reported the episode, it looked like propaganda."<ref name=sisci/>

==Aftermath==
The incident continues to serve as a significant reason for disputing the methods of Falun Gong in China. Posters, leaflets and videos were produced, detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice. In China's schools, regular anti-Falun Gong classes were scheduled on the orders of the authorities;<ref name=oneway/> The media incited 8 million students to join the ''"Anti-Cult Action by the Youth Civilized Communities Across the Nation"''.<ref name=dangerous/> Twelve million children submitted writings disapproving of the practice.<ref name=dangerous/>

On 16 February, Tan Yihui, a 25-year-old "shoeshine man" from [[Hunan]], committed self-immolation in west Beijing in another apparent Falun Gong protest. Police said Tan's six-page suicide note indicated that he was a follower. Witnesses saw Tan pouring petrol over himself and igniting with a lighter. Xinhua said that the police arrived on scene in three minutes and extinguished the blaze, by which time Tan was already dead. Pictures of the charred body were broadcast on television. ''[[The Independent]]'' said that "the nationwide coverage [of the earlier self-immolations] gave believers such as Mr Tan all the incentive they needed to conduct copycat protests."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/second-falun-gong-follower-dies-after-selfimmolation-692157.html |title=Second Falun Gong follower dies after self-immolation |first=Calum |last=MacLeod |work= The Independent |date=17 February 2001}}</ref>

Within a month of the Tiananmen Square incident, authorities issued a glossy pamphlet entitled ''The whole story of the self-immolation incident created by Falun Gong addicts in Tiananmen Square'', featuring colour photographs of charred bodies.<ref name=dangerous/> The [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]'s "Office for the Prevention and Handling of Evil Cults" declared after the event that it was now ready to form a united front with the global anti-cult struggle.<ref name=dangerous/> The IHT reported that Chinese media were attacking Falun Gong and Li Hongzhi every day. Meetings took place in factories, offices, universities and schools to educate people about Falun Gong. The Government announced that religious leaders from across the country had delivered denunciations of Falun Gong. In Kaifeng, the post office issued an anti-Falun Gong postmark, and 10,000 people signed a petition denouncing the group.<ref name=oneway/>

''Time'' reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's crackdown had gone too far. After the event, however, China's media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction.<ref name=breakingpoint/> One western diplomat commented that the public changed from sympathising with Falun Gong to siding with the Government, popular consensus seemingly shifted by human-interest stories and accounts of rehabilitation efforts of former practitioners.<ref name=ansfield>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Ansfield |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url= |title=After Olympic win, China takes new aim at Falun Gong |date=23 July 2001}}</ref> The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong reported that hostility toward Falun Gong from the general public escalated, the government had stepped up its campaign, and that "hate crimes" targeting Falun Gong increased.<ref name="WOIPFGpaper">{{cite web |author=WOIPFG |url=http://www.upholdjustice.org/English.2/S.I._highlights_report.htm |title=Investigation Reports on the Persecution of Falun Gong: Volume 1 |year=2003-2004 |publisher=upholdjustice.org |accessdate= 4 October 2007}}</ref>

===Trials===
Five people involved in the incident were put on trial in mid-2001. The authorities named Liu Yunfang as the mastermind, and gave him a life sentence; Wang Jindong was given 15 years. Two others said to have been involved in organizing the incident, a 49-year-old man named Xue Hongjun, and a 34-year-old Beijing woman named Liu Xiuqin who apparently provided the group with lodging and helped in the preparation of the incident, were sentenced to ten and seven years in prison respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/ppflg/t36594.htm|title=Organizers of Tian'anmen Self-Burning Incident Sentenced|date=17 August 2001|publisher=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the United States|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref name=real/> Liu Baorong, who had suggested the group use Sprite bottles to transport the gasoline, escaped punishment, because her role in planning the event was minor and she had "acknowledged her crime".<ref name="gittings2">{{cite web |first=John |last=Gittings |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/aug/21/worlddispatch.china |title=Chinese whispers surround Falun Gong trial |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 August 2001}}</ref><ref name=xinhua1 /> ''The Guardian'' reported that on the last day of the one-month trial, Xinhua had, by mid-morning, issued a full report of the verdicts; the ''[[People's Daily]]'' had produced its own editorial by the afternoon.<ref name="gittings2"/>
