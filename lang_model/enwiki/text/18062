'''Claude-B<U+00E9>nigne Balbastre''' (died [[May 9]], [[1799]]) was a [[France|French]] [[composer]], [[organist]] and [[harpsichord]]ist. He was one of the most famous musicians of his time.

==Life==
It is known that he was born in Dijon, but his birthdate is uncertain: it might be [[December 8]], [[1724]] or [[January 22]], [[1724]]/[[1727]]. Balbastre's father, a church organist in Dijon, had 18 children from two marriages and Claude-B<U+00E9>nigne was the 16th (three of his brothers were named Claude). He received his first music lessons from his father, then became a pupil of [[Claude Rameau]], the younger brother of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], the most famous French musician at the time and also a native of Dijon.

Balbastre settled in Paris in [[1750]] and studied there with [[Pierre F<U+00E9>vrier]], whom he succeeded as organist of the Saint Roch church. [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] helped and protected Claude-B<U+00E9>nigne when the latter settled in the city, so Balbastre was quickly and efficiently introduced to the parisian musical circles and high society, and made a brilliant career: he played at the ''[[Concert Spirituel]]'', became organist of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame cathedral]] and of the ''Chapelle Royale'', harpsichordist to the French royal court (he taught queen [[Marie-Antoinette]]) and organist for Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, [[Count of Provence]] (who later became [[Louis XVIII]], [[King of France]]). His fame was so great that the [[archbishop of Paris]] had to forbid him to play at Saint Roch during some of the services, because the churches were always crowded when Balbastre played.

In [[1763]] he married Marie-Genevi<U+00E8>ve Hotteterre, who came from a famous French family of musicians. During the [[French Revolution]], Balbastre's connection with nobility and the royal court might have endangered his life, but apparently he somehow adapted to the new politital situation, so he survived the storm, playing the Revolution hymns and songs on his organ. He did lose his official jobs and, temporarily, his pension. He died in Paris in [[1799]].

==Works==
Balbastre's known compositions include the following:

* 14 organ concertos (all lost)
* [[quartet]] [[sonata (music)|sonatas]]
* two collections of harpsichord pieces (from [[1748]] and [[1759]])
* four ''no<U+00EB>ls vari<U+00E9>s'' suites for the [[fortepiano]] ([[1770]]).
* [[Variation (music)|variations]] on [[La Marseillaise]]: ''Marche des Marseillois et l<U+2019>Air <U+00C7>a-ira Arrang<U+00E9>s pour le Forte Piano / Par le Citoyen C. Balbastre / Aux braves defenseurs de la Republique fran<U+00E7>aise l<U+2019>an 1792 1er de la Republique''

[[Charles Burney]] visited Balbastre and reported that the latter owned a very beautiful harpsichord by [[Ruckers]].
