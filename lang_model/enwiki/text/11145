__TOC__
== Biography and career ==
Abdelwahab Meddeb was born in [[Tunis|Tunis, Tunisia]] in 1946, into a learned and patrician milieu. His family<U+2019>s origins stretch from [[Tripoli]] and [[Yemen]] on his mother<U+2019>s side, to [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]] on his father<U+2019>s side. Raised in a traditionally observant [[North Africa]]n Muslim family, Meddeb began learning the [[Qur'an]] at age 4 from his father, Sheik Mustapha Meddeb, a scholar of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] at the Zitouna, the great mosque and university of Tunis. At age 6 he began his [[bilingual education]] at the Franco-Arabic school that was part of the famous [[Coll<U+00E8>ge Sadiki]]. Thus began an intellectual trajectory nourished, in adolescence, by the classics of both Arabic and French and European literatures.<ref>Abdelwahab Meddeb. Face <U+00E0> l<U+2019>islam. Entretien men<U+00E9> par [[Philippe Petit]]. Paris: Textuel, 2004. pp. 20-88. This volume consists of a series of three long interviews with the author.</ref> 

In 1967, Meddeb moved to Paris to continue his university studies at the [[Sorbonne]] in [[art history]].  He has lived there ever since, traveling the world as a poet, writer, translator, cultural critic, invited lecturer, scholar-in-residence and [[Professor|visiting professor]]. 

In 1970-72, he collaborated on the dictionary [[Petit Robert]] des noms propres, working on entries concerning Islam and art history.  From 1974-1987 he was a literary consultant at Sindbad publications, helping to introduce a French reading public to the classics of Arabic and Persian literatures as well as the great [[Sufi]] writers.  A visiting Professor at [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Geneva]], Meddeb has been teaching comparative literature since 1995 at the University of Paris X-Nanterre. Between 1992 and 1994 he was co-editor of the journal ''Intersignes'', and in 1995 he created his own journal, ''D<U+00E9>dale'', all the while producing works of fiction, poetry, and translation.<ref>[[:fr:Abdelwahab Meddeb|Wikipedia]]</ref>   His first novel, ''Talismano'', was published in Paris in 1979 and quickly became a founding text of [[avant-garde]] [[Postcolonial literature|postcolonial fiction]] in French.  

Since [[9/11]] his work, always informed by what Meddeb terms his <U+201C>double genealogy,<U+201D> both western and Islamic, French and Arabic, has included an urgent political dimension. An outspoken critic of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], he is a staunch proponent of [[secularism]] (<U+201C>la la<U+00EF>cit<U+00E9><U+201D>) in the [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]] tradition, as the necessary [[guarantor]] of democracy that would reconcile Islam with [[modernity]]. His vigilant point of view derives from the privilege of what he calls the <U+201C>in-between<U+201D> space (<U+201C>l<U+2019>entre deux<U+201D>), and from the responsibility that comes with the position of public intellectual as an Arab writer based in France.  His  erudite historical and cultural analyses of world events impacted by [[Extremism|Islamic extremism]] have led to innumerable publications, interviews and radio commentaries.  In response to 9/11 and its grave aftermath, Meddeb published his important study, ''La Maladie de l<U+2019>Islam'' in 2002 (since translated and published in English as ''The Malady of Islam''). This carefully researched and argued book traces the historical and cultural riches of medieval [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], eventually <U+201C>inconsolable in its destitution,<U+201D> the subsequent roots of Islamic fundamentalism and the modern Arab states<U+2019> attachment to the archaic, manichean laws of <U+201C>official Islam,<U+201D> and finally, the tragic consequences of the West<U+2019>s exclusion of Islam.<ref>Abdelwahab Meddeb. ''The Malady of Islam''. Translated by [[Pierre Joris]]. New York: [[Basic Books]], 2003.</ref>  

From editorials in the French newspaper [[Le Monde]] on the [[Gaza War|Israeli invasion of Gaza]] (ie., [[Gaza_War#Attack_on_Gaza_City|13 Jan. <U+2019>09]]),<ref>[http://www.signandsight.com/features/1813.html - The English translation of <U+201C>Pornography of Horror.<U+201D>]</ref> to Obama<U+2019>s [[A New Beginning|<U+201C>Cairo Speech<U+201D>]] (4 June 2009), to his two weekly radio programs, "Cultures d<U+2019>Islam" at '[[Radio France]] Culture' and "Point de Vue" at [[M<U+00E9>di 1]] (broadcast from Tangiers, Morocco), to his television appearances and his online interviews, Meddeb uses the media as a forum for exploration and debate. His work juxtaposes writers and scholars from East and West, engaging subjects that are historical, cultural, religious, political, and thereby challenging the stereotypes that Arabs and Europeans hold about each other. A voice of tolerant Islam, Meddeb is no stranger to controversy from militant Muslim quarters.

== Overview of the Literary Work ==
From his earliest essays, novels, poems and editorial work in the mid-1970<U+2019>s onward, Meddeb<U+2019>s writing has always been multiple and diverse, forming an on-going literary project that mixes and transcends [[genres]]. His texts are those of a [[polymath]].

The movement and rhythms of his French sentences are commensurate with the meditations of a narrator who is a [[fl<U+00E2>neur]], a walker in the city, and a poet without borders.  Associative imagery allows the writing to nomadize across space and time, to dialogue with writers such as [[Dante]] and [[Ibn Arabi]], the [[Sufi poetry|Sufi poets]] and [[Mallarm<U+00E9>]], [[Spinoza]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), along with the poets of classical China and Japan. Formally, Meddeb practices what he calls an <U+201C>esthetics of the [[heterogeneous]],<U+201D> playing with different literary forms from many traditions, including the European modernist novel, [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arabic poetry]], the medieval [[Arabic_poetry#Court_poets|mystical poets of Islam]], Japanese [[Haiku]], and so on.<ref>Abdelwahab Meddeb. ''Talismano''. Paris: Sindbad-Actes Sud. 1987. Forthcoming in English from [[Dalkey Archive]] Press, University of Illinois.</ref>  Although he writes only in French, his work as a translator of medieval [[Arabophone]] poets, as well as his conscious literary ambition to <U+201C>liberate the Islamic referent from its strict context so that it circulates in the contemporary French text<U+201D> marks his writing with enigmatic traces of <U+2018>otherness.<U+201D>  His privileging of these Arabic and Persian literary precursors explores archaic cultural resources in [[postmodern]] forms, emphasizing the esthetic, spiritual and ethical aspects of Islam.  His work, translated into over a dozen languages, opens onto and enriches the dialogue with contemporary [[world literature]].
