The '''polar bear''' (''Ursus maritimus'') is a [[bear]] native largely within the [[Arctic circle]] encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the world's largest land [[carnivore]] and also the largest bear, together with the [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[Kodiak bear]], which is approximately the same size.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/polar_bear.pdf |format=PDF| title = Polar bear, (Ursus maritimus) | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife service | accessdate = 9 September 2009| quote = Appearance.

The [[IUCN]] now lists [[global warming]] as the most significant threat to the polar bear, primarily because the melting of its sea ice habitat reduces its ability to find sufficient food. The IUCN states, "If climatic trends continue polar bears may become extirpated from most of their [[range (biology)|range]] within 100 years."<ref name="iucn">{{IUCN2010.3

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Image:Polarbearonice.jpg|thumb|right|Polar bears depend on [[sea ice]] as a platform for hunting seals. Large feet and short, sharp, stocky claws are adaptations to this environment.]]

The bear [[family (biology)|family]], Ursidae, is believed to have split off from other carnivorans about 38 million years ago. The Ursinae subfamily originated approximately 4.2 million years ago. According to both fossil and DNA evidence, the polar bear diverged from the brown bear, ''Ursus arctos'', roughly 150,000 years ago.<ref name="Lindqvist">{{Cite journal |title=Complete mitochondrial genome of a Pleistocene jawbone unveils the origin of polar bear |first=Charlotte |last=Lindqvist |first2=Stephan C. |last2=Schuster |first3=Yazhou |last3=Sun |first4=Sandra L. |last4=Talbot |first5=Ji |last5=Qi |first6=Aakrosh |last6=Ratan |first7=Lynn P. |last7=Tomsho |first8=Lindsay |last8=Kasson |first9=Eve |last9=Zeyl |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=107 |issue=11 |pages=5053<U+2013>5057 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0914266107 |year=2010 |pmid=20194737 |pmc=2841953 }}.</ref> The oldest known polar bear [[fossil]] is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on [[Prince Charles Foreland]] in 2004.<ref name="Lindqvist" /> Fossils show that between ten to twenty thousand years ago, the polar bear's [[molar (tooth)|molar teeth]] changed significantly from those of the brown bear.

When the polar bear was originally documented, two [[subspecies]] were identified: ''Ursus maritimus maritimus'' by Constantine J.

One fossil subspecies has been identified. ''[[Ursus maritimus tyrannus]]''<U+2014>descended from ''Ursus arctos''<U+2014>became extinct during the Pleistocene. ''U.m. tyrannus'' was significantly larger than the living subspecies.<ref name="DeMaster1981"/>

The polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses. Due to the absence of human development in its remote habitat, it retains more of its original range than any other [[extant taxon|extant]] [[carnivore]].<ref name=derocher2004/> While they are rare north of 88<U+00B0>, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic, and as far south as [[James Bay]] in Canada. They can occasionally [[drift ice|drift]] widely with the sea ice, and there have been anecdotal sightings as far south as [[Berlev<U+00E5>g]] on the Norwegian mainland and the [[Kuril Islands]] in the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied, however biologists use a working estimate of about 20,000<U+2013>25,000 polar bears worldwide.<ref name=iucn31/><ref name="PBI"/>

The white coat usually yellows with age.

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Polarbear spitzbergen 1.jpg|thumb|right|The long muzzle and neck of the polar bear help it to search in deep holes for seals, while powerful hindquarters enable it to drag massive prey.<ref name=matthews73-88/>]]
The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and most of its diet consists of [[Ringed Seal|ringed]] and [[bearded seal]]s.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Arctic Bears | url =http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/arcticbears/index.html | series = PBS Nature | serieslink = Nature (TV series) | airdate = 17 February 2008}}</ref> The Arctic is home to millions of seals, which become prey when they surface in holes in the ice in order to breathe, or when they haul out on the ice to rest.<ref name=matthews73-88>Matthews, pp. 73<U+2013>88</ref> Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air; they only rarely catch seals on land or in open water.<ref name=amstrup2007/>

The polar bear's most common hunting method is called ''still-hunting'':<ref name=hemstock24-27>Hemstock, pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref> The bear uses its excellent sense of smell to locate a seal breathing hole, and crouches nearby in silence for a seal to appear.<ref name=matthews73-88/> When the seal exhales, the bear smells its breath, reaches into the hole with a forepaw, and drags it out onto the ice.<ref name=matthews73-88/> The polar bear kills the seal by biting its head to crush its skull.<ref name=matthews73-88/> The polar bear also hunts by stalking seals resting on the ice: Upon spotting a seal, it walks to within {{convert|100|yd|abbr=on}}, and then crouches. If the seal does not notice, the bear creeps to within {{convert|30|to|40|ft}} of the seal and then suddenly rushes forth to attack.<ref name=matthews73-88/> A third hunting method is to raid the birth lairs that female seals create in the snow.<ref name=hemstock24-27/>
[[File:Polar Bear ANWR 10.jpg|200px|Polar bear at a [[whale]] carcass|left|thumb]]
A widespread legend tells that polar bears cover their black noses with their paws when hunting. This behavior, if it happens, is rare <U+2014> although the story exists in native [[oral history]] and in accounts by early [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], there is no record of an eyewitness account of the behavior in recent decades.<ref name=behavior>{{cite book|last=Stirling |first= Ian |year=1988 |title= Polar Bears |location= Ann Arbor |authorlink=Ian Stirling |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-10100-5 |chapter= Behavior}}</ref>

Mature bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat.<ref name=matthews73-88/> Studies have also photographed polar bears scaling near-vertical cliffs, to eat birds' chicks and eggs <ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8622000/8622244.stm | work=BBC News | title=In pictures: Rock climbing polar bears | date=20 April 2010}}</ref>. For [[Juvenile (organism)|subadult]] bears which are independent of their mother but have not yet gained enough experience and body size to successfully hunt seals, scavenging the carcasses from other bears' kills is an important source of nutrition. Subadults may also be forced to accept a half-eaten carcass if they kill a seal but cannot defend it from larger polar bears. After feeding, polar bears wash themselves with water or snow.<ref name=behavior>

The polar bear is an enormously powerful predator. It can kill an adult [[walrus]], although it rarely attempts to as a walrus can be more than twice the bear's weight.<ref name="Clarkson1994" /> In addition, it has long ivory tusks, up to three feet long, which can be used as very formidable weapons. Polar bears also have been seen to prey on [[beluga whale]]s, by swiping at them at breathing holes. The whales are of similar size to the walrus and nearly as difficult for the bear to subdue. Polar bears very seldom attack full-grown adult whales. Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear on land as polar bears overheat quickly, and most marine animals the bear encounters can outswim it. In some areas, the polar bear's diet is supplemented by walrus calves and by the carcasses of dead adult walruses or whales, whose blubber is readily devoured even when rotten.<ref name=bruemmer2533/>

With the exception of pregnant females, polar bears are active year-round,<ref name="tick"/> although they have a vestigial [[hibernation induction trigger]] in their blood. Unlike brown and black bears, polar bears are capable of [[fasting]] for up to several months during late summer and early fall, when they cannot hunt for seals because the sea is unfrozen.<ref name="tick"/> When sea ice is unavailable during summer and early autumn, some populations live off fat reserves for months at a time.<ref name="stirling1988" /> Polar bears have also been observed to eat a wide variety of other wild foods, including [[muskox]], [[reindeer]], birds, eggs, rodents, shellfish, crabs, and other polar bears. They may also eat plants, including [[berry|berries]], roots, and [[kelp]], however none of these are a significant part of their diet.<ref name="Clarkson1994"/> The polar bear's biology is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals, and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food.<ref>{{Cite news | last1=Ramsay | first1=M.

[[Image:Polar Bears Play fight.JPG|thumb|left|Polar bear males frequently play-fight. During the mating season, actual fighting is intense and often leaves scars or broken teeth.]]

===Behavior===
Unlike grizzly bears, polar bears are not [[territory (animal)|territorial]]. Although stereotyped as being voraciously aggressive, they are normally cautious in confrontations, and often choose to escape rather than fight.<ref name=matthews2729>Matthews, pp. 27<U+2013>29</ref> Fat polar bears rarely attack humans unless severely provoked, whereas hungry polar bears are extremely unpredictable and are known to kill and sometimes eat humans.<ref name=bruemmer2533>Bruemmer, pp. 25<U+2013>33</ref> Polar bears are stealth hunters, and the victim is often unaware of the bear's presence until the attack is underway.<ref name=conflicts/> Whereas [[brown bear]]s often maul a person and then leave, polar bear attacks are more likely to be predatory and are almost always fatal.<ref name=conflicts>{{cite book|last=Stirling |first= Ian |year=1988 |title= Polar Bears |location= Ann Arbor |authorlink=Ian Stirling |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-10100-5 |chapter= Distribution and Abundance}}</ref> However, due to the very small human population around the [[Arctic]], such attacks are rare.

In general, adult polar bears live solitary lives. Yet, they have often been seen playing together for hours at a time and even sleeping in an embrace,<ref name=bruemmer2533/> and polar bear zoologist Nikita Ovsianikov has described adult males as having "well-developed friendships."<ref name=matthews2729/> Cubs are especially playful as well. Among young males in particular, play-fighting may be a means of practicing for serious competition during mating seasons later in life.<ref>Matthews, p. 95</ref> Polar bears have a wide range of vocalisations, including bellows, roars, growls, chuffs and purrs.<ref>''Bear Behaviour and Activities'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993</ref>

In [[1992]], a photographer near Churchill took a now widely circulated set of photographs of a polar bear playing with a [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] a tenth of its size.<ref name=rosing128132/><ref>[http://nifplay.org/polar-husky.html Why Didn't the Wild Polar Bear eat the Husky?] The National Institute for Play</ref> The pair wrestled harmlessly together each afternoon for ten days in a row for no apparent reason, although the bear may have been trying to demonstrate its friendliness in the hope of sharing the kennel's food.<ref name=rosing128132>Rosing, pp. 128<U+2013>132</ref> This kind of social interaction is uncommon; it is far more typical for polar bears to behave aggressively towards dogs.<ref name=rosing128132/>

===Reproduction and lifecycle===
[[Image:Polar bear arctic.JPG|A polar bear swimming|thumb]]
Courtship and mating take place on the sea ice in April and May, when polar bears congregate in the best seal hunting areas.<ref name=reproduction/> A male may follow the tracks of a breeding female for {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} or more, and after finding her engage in intense fighting with other males over mating rights, fights which often result in scars and broken teeth.<ref name=reproduction/> Polar bears have a generally [[polygyny|polygynous]] mating system; recent genetic testing of mothers and cubs, however, has uncovered cases of litters in which cubs have different fathers.<ref name=carpenter>{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Tom|date=November/December 2005|title=Who's Your Daddy?|journal=[[Canadian Geographic]]|publisher=The Royal Canadian Geographic Society|location=Ottawa|pages=44<U+2013>56}}</ref> Partners stay together and mate repeatedly for an entire week; the mating ritual induces [[ovulation]] in the female.<ref name=rosing42-48>Rosing, pp. 42<U+2013>48</ref>

After mating, the fertilized egg remains in a suspended state until August or September. During these four months, the pregnant female eats prodigious amounts of food, gaining at least {{convert|200|kg|abbr=on}} and often more than doubling her body weight.<ref name=reproduction/>

====Maternity denning and early life====
[[Image:Ursus maritimus us fish.jpg|thumb|Cubs are born helpless, and typically nurse for two and a half years.]]
When the ice floes break up in the fall, ending the possibility of hunting, each pregnant female digs a ''maternity den'' consisting of a narrow entrance tunnel leading to one to three chambers.<ref name=reproduction/> Most maternity dens are in snowdrifts, but may also be made underground in [[permafrost]] if it is not sufficiently cold yet for snow.<ref name=reproduction/> In most subpopulations, maternity dens are situated on land a few kilometers from the coast, and the individuals in a subpopulation tend to reuse the same denning areas each year.<ref name=derocher2004/> The polar bears that do not den on land make their dens on the sea ice. In the den, she enters a dormant state similar to [[hibernation]]. This hibernation-like state does not consist of continuous sleeping; however, the bear's heart rate slows from 46 to 27 beats per minute.<ref name=lockwood17-21>Lockwood, pp.17<U+2013>21</ref> Her body temperature does not decrease during this period as it would for a typical mammal in hibernation.<ref name="stirling1988" /><ref>{{Cite news | last1=Bruce | first1=D.

Between November and February, cubs are born blind, covered with a light down fur, and weighing less than {{convert|0.9|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rosing42-48/> On average, each litter has two cubs.<ref name=reproduction/> The family remains in the den until mid-February to mid-April, with the mother maintaining her fast while nursing her cubs on a fat-rich milk.<ref name=reproduction/> By the time the mother breaks open the entrance to the den, her cubs weigh about {{convert|10|to|15|kg}}.<ref name=reproduction/> For about 12 to 15 days, the family spends time outside the den while remaining in its vicinity, the mother grazing on vegetation while the cubs become used to walking and playing.<ref name=reproduction/> Then they begin the long walk from the denning area to the sea ice, where the mother can once again catch seals.<ref name =reproduction/> Depending on the timing of ice-floe breakup in the fall, she may have fasted for up to eight months.<ref name=reproduction/>

Cubs may fall prey to wolves or to starvation. Female polar bears are noted for both their affection towards their offspring, and their valiance in protecting them.

===Ecological role===
[[Image:Nursing Ursus maritimus.jpg|A female nursing a two-year-old cub|thumb|right]]
The polar bear is the [[apex predator]] within its range. Several animal species, particularly [[Arctic Fox]]es and [[Glaucous Gull]]s, routinely scavenge polar bear kills.<ref name=behavior/>

The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so close that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn, regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals.<ref name=amstrup2007/> The [[evolutionary pressure]] of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], where there is no major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice.<ref name=behavior/> The baby fur of most Arctic seal species is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic seals all have dark fur at birth.<ref name=behavior/>

Polar bears rarely enter conflict with other predators, though recent [[brown bear]] encroachments into polar bear territories have led to antagonistic encounters. Brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses,<ref>[http://dwb.adn.com/front/story/6415667p-6294323c.html adn.com | front : Polar bears, grizzlies increasingly gather on North Slope]</ref> and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/DyeHard/Story?id=582243&page=3 |title=ABC News: Grizzlies Encroaching on Polar Bear Country |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref> [[wolf|Wolves]] are rarely encountered by polar bears, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic59-3-322.pdf Wolf (Canis lupus) Predation of a Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) Cub on the Sea Ice off Northwestern Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada.

Polar bears have long provided important raw materials for Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, [[Yupik]], [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]], Russian [[Pomors]] and others. Hunters commonly used teams of dogs to distract the bear, allowing the hunter to spear the bear or shoot it with arrows at closer range.<ref name=original/> Almost all parts of captured animals had a use.<ref name=lw6-9/> The fur was used in particular to sew trousers and, by the Nenets, to make galoshes-like outer footwear called ''tobok''; the [[meat]] is edible, despite some risk of [[trichinosis]]; the fat was used in food and as a fuel for lighting homes, alongside seal and whale blubber; [[Tendon|sinews]] were used as thread for sewing clothes; the [[gallbladder]] and sometimes [[Myocardium|heart]] were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; the large canine teeth were highly valued as [[Amulet|talismans]].<ref name=Uspensky/> Only the [[liver]] was not used, as its high concentration of [[Retinol|vitamin A]] is poisonous.<ref>As a carnivore which feeds largely upon [[fish]]-eating carnivores, the polar bear ingests large amounts of [[Retinol|vitamin A]], which is stored in their [[liver]]s.

Traditional subsistence hunting was on a small enough scale to not significantly affect polar bear populations, mostly because of the sparseness of the human population in polar bear habitat.<ref name=lw31-36/>

===History of commercial harvest===
In Russia, polar bear furs were already being commercially traded in the 14th century, though it was of low value compared to Arctic Fox or even reindeer fur.<ref name=Uspensky/> The growth of the human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th century, together with the advent of firearms and increasing trade, dramatically increased the harvest of polar bears.<ref name="stirling1988" /><ref name=nwt>{{cite web |url=http://wildlife.enr.gov.nt.ca/NWTWildlife/bears/PolarBear/management.htm |title=Polar Bear Management |publisher=Government of the Northwest Territories |accessdate=14 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080504105354/http://wildlife.enr.gov.nt.ca/NWTWildlife/bears/PolarBear/management.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 May 2008}}</ref> However, since polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role, data on the historical harvest is fragmentary. It is known, for example, that already in the winter of 1784/1785 Russian Pomors on [[Spitsbergen]] harvested 150 polar bears in [[Magdalenefjorden]].<ref name=Uspensky/> In the early 20th century, Norwegian hunters were harvesting 300 bears a year at the same location. Estimates of total historical harvest suggest that from the beginning of the 18th century, roughly 400<U+2013>500 animals were being harvested annually in northern Eurasia, reaching a peak of 1,300 to 1,500 animals in the early 20th century, and falling off as the numbers began dwindling.<ref name=Uspensky/>

In the first half of the 20th century, mechanized and overpoweringly efficient methods of hunting and trapping came into use in North America as well.<ref name=bruemmer93-111/> Polar bears were chased from [[snowmobile]]s, [[icebreaker]]s, and airplanes, the latter practice described in a 1965 ''New York Times'' editorial as being "about as sporting as machine gunning a cow."<ref name=bruemmer93-111>Bruemmer, pp. 93<U+2013>111</ref>
The numbers taken grew rapidly in the 1960s, peaking around 1968 with a global total of 1,250 bears that year.<ref name="PBSG2">{{cite conference | year = 1970 | month = February | conference = Polar Bears | conferenceurl = http://pbsg.npolar.no/ | title = Proceedings of the 2nd Working Meeting of Polar Bear Specialists | publisher = [[IUCN]] | location = Morges, Switzerland | url = http://pbsg.npolar.no/Meetings/PressReleases/02-Morges.htm | accessdate = 24 October 2007}}</ref>

===Contemporary regulations===
Concerns over the future survival of the species led to the development of national regulations on polar bear hunting, beginning in the mid-1950s.<ref>Norway passed a series of increasingly strict regulations from 1965 to 1973, and has completely banned hunting since then. The Soviet Union banned all hunting in 1956. Canada began imposing hunting quotas in 1968. The U.S. began regulating in 1971 and adopted the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act]] in 1972.</ref> In 1973, the [[International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears]] was signed by all five nations whose territory is inhabited by polar bears [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Norway]] ([[Svalbard]]), the [[USSR]] (now the [[Russian Federation]]) and the [[USA]] ([[Alaska]]).

[[Image:Isbjornskilt.png|upright|thumb|right|A Norwegian road sign used on [[Svalbard]] to warn about the presence of polar bears.]]
Also known as the Oslo Agreement, it was a rare case of international cooperation during the [[Cold War]]. Biologist [[Ian Stirling]] commented, "For many years, the conservation of polar bears was the only subject in the entire Arctic that nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain could agree upon sufficiently to sign an agreement. Such was the intensity of human fascination with this magnificent predator, the only marine bear."<ref>[[Ian Stirling|Stirling, Ian]] ''Foreword'' in {{cite book |title=The World of the Polar Bear|last=Rosing |first=Norbert |year=1996 |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd. |location= Willowdale, ON |isbn=1-55209-068-X}}</ref>

Although the agreement is not enforceable in itself, member countries agreed to place restrictions on recreational and commercial hunting, ban hunting from aircraft and icebreakers, and conduct further research.<ref>[http://pbsg.npolar.no/ConvAgree/agreement.htm International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears], 15 November 1973, Oslo</ref> The treaty allows hunting "by local people using traditional methods," although this has been liberally interpreted by member nations. [[Norway]] is the only country of the five in which all harvest of polar bears is banned.

Agreements have been made between countries to co-manage their shared polar bear subpopulations. After several years of negotiations, [[Russia]] and the [[U.S.]] signed an agreement in October 2000 to jointly set quotas for indigenous subsistence hunting in Alaska and [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE3DD1F3FF934A25753C1A9669C8B63|title=U.S. and Russia Sign Pact To Protect the Polar Bear |work=New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2008|date=17 October 2000}}</ref> The treaty was ratified in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071014202952.htm|title=US-Russia Polar Bear Treaty Ratified|date=18 October 2007|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref>

====Russia====
The [[Soviet Union]] banned all harvest of polar bears in 1956, however poaching continued and is believed to pose a serious threat to the polar bear population.<ref name=PBSG14/> In recent years, polar bears have approached coastal villages in Chukotka more frequently due to the shrinking of the sea ice, endangering humans and raising concerns that illegal hunting would become even more prevalent.<ref name=myers/> In 2007, the Russian government made subsistence hunting legal for Chukotka natives only, a move supported by Russia<U+2019>s most prominent bear researchers and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] as a means to curb poaching.<ref name=myers>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/world/europe/16polar.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Russia Tries to Save Polar Bears With Legal Hunt |author=Steven Lee Myers|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2008|date=16 April 2007}}</ref>

====Greenland====
In Greenland, restrictions for the species were first introduced in 1994 and expanded by executive order in 2005.<ref name="PBSG14" /> Until 2005, Greenland placed no limit on hunting by indigenous people. It imposed a limit of 150 for 2006. It also allowed recreational hunting for the first time.<ref>[http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/marine_mammals_news/Hitting_polar_bears_when_they_are_down.html The Humane Society of the United States "Hitting Polar Bears When They Are Down"]</ref> Other provisions included year-round protection of cubs and mothers, restrictions on weapons used, and various administrative requirements to catalogue kills.<ref name="PBSG14" />

On 15 May 2008, the U.S. listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the [[Endangered Species Act]] and banned all importing of polar bear trophies. Importing products made from polar bears had been prohibited from 1972 to 1994 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and restricted between 1994 and 2008. Under those restrictions, permits from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] were required to import sport-hunted polar bear trophies taken in hunting expeditions in Canada. The permit process required that the bear be taken from an area with quotas based on sound management principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/bear-facts/hunting/ |title=Bear Facts: Harvesting/Hunting |publisher= Polar Bears International |accessdate=14 March 2008}}</ref> Since 1994, more than 800 sport-hunted polar bear trophies have been imported into the U.S.<ref>[https://community.hsus.org/campaign/FED_2007_polar_bear_trophy The Humane Society of the United States "Support the Polar Bear Protection Act"]</ref>

Ironically, because of the way polar bear hunting quotas are managed in [[Canada]], attempts to discourage sport hunting would actually increase the number of bears killed in the short term.<ref name=campbell/> Canada allocates a certain number of permits each year to sport and subsistence hunting, and those that are not used for sport hunting are re-allocated to Native subsistence hunting. Whereas Native communities kill all the polar bears they are permitted to take each year, only half of sport hunters with permits actually manage to kill a polar bear. If a sport hunter does not kill a polar bear before his or her permit expires, the permit cannot be transferred to another hunter.<ref name=campbell/>

The territory of [[Nunavut]] accounts for 80% of Canadian kills.<ref name="cdnmgt" /> In 2005, the government of Nunavut increased the quota from 400 to 518 bears,<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/01/10/polar-bear-hunt050110.html CBC News, 10 January 2005, "Nunavut hunters can kill more polar bears this year"]</ref> despite protests from some scientific groups.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/07/04/polar-bears050704.html CBC News, 4 July 2005, "Rethink polar bear hunt quotas, scientists tell Nunavut hunters"]</ref> In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient.<ref name=sd2007/> While most of that quota is hunted by the indigenous Inuit people, a growing share is sold to recreational hunters.

As of 2008, the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) reports that the global population of polar bears is 20,000 to 25,000, and is declining.<ref name=iucn31/> In 2006, the IUCN upgraded the polar bear from a species of [[least concern]] to a [[vulnerable species]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Release of the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reveals ongoing decline of the status of plants and animals | url = http://www.iucn.org/en/news/archive/2006/05/02_pr_red_list_en.htm | work = World Conservation Union |accessdate = 1 February 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060512071333/http://www.iucn.org/en/news/archive/2006/05/02_pr_red_list_en.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 May 2006}}</ref> It cited a "suspected population reduction of >30% within three generations (45 years)", due primarily to [[global warming]].<ref name=iucn/> Other risks to the polar bear include [[pollution]] in the form of [[toxic]] contaminants, conflicts with shipping, stresses from recreational polar-bear watching, and oil and gas exploration and development.<ref name=iucn/> The IUCN also cited a "potential risk of [[over-harvest]]" through legal and illegal hunting.<ref name=iucn/>

According to the [[World Wildlife Fund]], the polar bear is important as an indicator of arctic [[ecosystem]] health. Polar bears are studied to gain understanding of what is happening throughout the Arctic, because at-risk polar bears are often a sign of something wrong with the arctic marine ecosystem.<ref>WWF: A Leader in Polar Bear Conservation .

The key danger posed by global warming is malnutrition or starvation due to [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. Polar bears hunt seals from a platform of sea ice. Rising temperatures cause the sea ice to melt earlier in the year, driving the bears to shore before they have built sufficient fat reserves to survive the period of scarce food in the late summer and early fall.<ref name="stirling1999">{{Cite news | last1=Stirling | first1=Ian | last2=Lunn | first2=N.

In addition to creating nutritional stress, a warming climate is expected to affect various other aspects of polar bear life: Changes in sea ice affect the ability of pregnant females to build suitable maternity dens. As the distance increases between the pack ice and the coast, females must swim longer distances to reach favored denning areas on land.<ref name="derocher2004"/> Thawing of permafrost would affect the bears who traditionally den underground, and warm winters could result in den roofs collapsing or having reduced insulative value.<ref name=derocher2004/> For the polar bears that currently den on multi-year ice, increased ice mobility may result in longer distances for mothers and young cubs to walk when they return to seal-hunting areas in the spring.<ref name=derocher2004/> Disease-causing [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s would flourish more readily in a warmer climate.<ref name=amstrup2007/>

Problematic interactions between polar bears and humans, such as foraging by bears in garbage dumps, have historically been more prevalent in years when ice-floe breakup occurred early and local polar bears were relatively thin.<ref name=stirling2006/> Increased human-bear interactions, including fatal attacks on humans, are likely to increase as the sea ice shrinks and hungry bears try to find food on land.<ref name=stirling2006/><ref>Mitchell Taylor, a former polar bear researcher for the Nunavut government, believes that arctic warming has been caused by natural phenomena and is not a long-term threat to the polar bear. After his retirement, he was not re-appointed to the international Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), giving rise to speculation that he was excluded from the group because of his views on global warming. According to the PBSG chair, appointments to the PBSG are given to scientists who are currently active in polar bear research, and that as a retired researcher Taylor did not qualify.

====Observations linked to global warming====
[[Image:Ursus maritimus Polar bear with cub 2.jpg|thumb|left|Mothers and cubs have high nutritional requirements, which are not met if the seal-hunting season is too short.]]
The effects of global warming are most profound in the southern part of the polar bear's range, and this is indeed where significant degradation of local populations has been observed.<ref name=acia/> The Western Hudson Bay subpopulation, in a southern part of the range, also happens to be one of the best-studied polar bear subpopulations. This subpopulation feeds heavily on ringed seals in late spring, when newly weaned and easily hunted seal pups are abundant.<ref name=sd2007/> The late spring hunting season ends for polar bears when the ice begins to melt and break up, and they fast or eat little during the summer until the sea freezes again.<ref name=sd2007/>

Due to warming air temperatures, ice-floe breakup in western Hudson Bay is currently occurring three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago, reducing the duration of the polar bear feeding season.<ref name=sd2007/> The body condition of polar bears has declined during this period; the average weight of lone (and likely pregnant) female polar bears was approximately {{convert|290|kg|abbr=on}} in 1980 and {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}} in 2004.<ref name=sd2007/> Between 1987 and 2004, the Western Hudson Bay population declined by 22%.<ref name="regehr2007">{{Cite news | last1=Regehr | first1=E.

===Pollution===
Polar bears [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] high levels of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s  such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCBs) and chlorinated [[pesticides]]. Due to their position at the top of the [[ecological pyramid|food pyramid]], with a diet heavy in [[blubber]] in which halocarbons concentrate, their bodies are among the most contaminated of Arctic mammals.<ref name=ec_bulletin>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Science/sandemay00/article4_e.html|title= Polar Bears at the Top of POPs|date=May/June 2000|work=The Science and the Environment Bulletin|publisher=[[Environment Canada]]|accessdate=20 October 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Halocarbons are known to be toxic to other animals because they mimic [[hormone]] chemistry, and [[biomarker]]s such as [[immunoglobulin G]] and retinol suggest similar effects on polar bears.

The most notorious of these chemicals, such as PCBs and [[DDT]], have been internationally banned. Their concentrations in polar bear tissues continued to rise for decades after the ban as these chemicals spread through the food chain. But the trend seems to have abated, with tissue concentrations of PCBs declining between studies performed in 1989<U+2013>1993 and studies performed in 1996<U+2013>2002.<ref>{{Cite news | last1=Verreault | first1=Jonathan | last2=Muir | first2=Derek C.G. | last3=Norstrom | first3=Ross J. | last4=Stirling | first4=Ian | date=December 2005 | title=Chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants and metabolites in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Alaska, Canada, East Greenland, and Svalbard: 1996<U+2013>2002 | periodical=Science of the Total Environment | publication-place=Shannon, Ireland | publisher=Elsevier | volume=351<U+2013>352 | issue= | pages=369<U+2013>390 | url=http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/andrew_derocher/uploads/abstracts/Verreault%20et%20al%20STOTEN%202005.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.10.031 | accessdate=17 November 2007 | journal=Science of The Total Environment | pmid=16115663 | last5=Fisk | first5=AT | last6=Gabrielsen | first6=GW | last7=Derocher | first7=AE | last8=Evans | first8=TJ | last9=Dietz | first9=R}}</ref>

Sometimes excess [[heavy metals]] have also been observed in the polar bear.

===Oil and gas development===
[[Image:Knut Briefmarke 2008.jpg|thumb|left|German stamp depicting [[Knut (polar bear)|Knut]] and the slogan "Preserve nature worldwide"]]
Oil and gas development in polar bear habitat can affect the bears in a variety of ways. An [[oil spill]] in the Arctic would most likely concentrate in the areas where polar bears and their prey are also concentrated, such as sea ice leads.<ref name="iucn"/> Because polar bears rely partly on their fur for insulation and soiling of the fur by oil reduces its insulative value, oil spills put bears at risk of dying from [[hypothermia]].<ref name="tick">{{cite book|last=Stirling |first= Ian |year=1988 |title= Polar Bears |location= Ann Arbor |authorlink=Ian Stirling |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-10100-5 |chapter= What Makes a Polar Bear Tick?}}</ref> Polar bears exposed to oil spill conditions have been observed to lick the oil from their fur, leading to fatal kidney failure.<ref name="tick"/> Maternity dens, used by pregnant females and by females with infants, can also be disturbed by nearby oil exploration and development. Disturbance of these sensitive sites may trigger the mother to abandon her den prematurely, or abandon her litter altogether.<ref name="iucn"/>

====Predictions====
The U.S. Geological Survey predicts two-thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear by 2050, based on moderate projections for the shrinking of summer sea ice caused by global warming.<ref name="amstrup2007">{{Cite book | last = Amstrup | first = Steven C. | last2=Marcot | first2=Bruce G. | last3=Douglas | first3=David C. | year = 2007 | title = Forecasting the Range-wide Status of Polar Bears at Selected Times in the 21st Century | publication-place =Reston, Virginia | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | id = | url = http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/special/polar_bears/docs/USGS_PolarBear_Amstrup_Forecast_lowres.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =29 September 2007}}</ref> The bears would disappear from Europe, Asia, and Alaska, and be depleted from the Arctic archipelago of Canada and areas off the northern Greenland coast. By 2080, they would disappear from Greenland entirely and from the northern Canadian coast, leaving only dwindling numbers in the interior Arctic archipelago.<ref name="amstrup2007" />

Predictions vary on the extent to which polar bears could adapt to climate change by switching to terrestrial food sources. Mitchell Taylor, who was director of Wildlife Research for the Government of Nunavut, wrote to the US Fish and Wildlife Service arguing that local studies are insufficient evidence for global protection at this time. The letter stated, "At present, the polar bear is one of the best managed of the large Arctic mammals. If all Arctic nations continue to abide by the terms and intent of the Polar Bear Agreement, the future of polar bears is secure.... Clearly polar bears can adapt to climate change. They have evolved and perisisted for thousands of years in a period characterized by fluctuating climate."<ref name="Taylor">{{cite paper | author = Taylor, Mitchell K. | title = Review of CBD Petition | publisher = Letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date= 6 April 2006 | url = http://www.ff.org/centers/csspp/pdf/200701_taylor.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 September 2007}}</ref> Ken Taylor, deputy commissioner for the [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]], has said, "I wouldn't be surprised if polar bears learned to feed on spawning salmon like grizzly bears."<ref name=campbell/>

However, many scientists consider these theories to be naive;<ref name =campbell/> it is noted that black and brown bears at high latitudes are smaller than elsewhere, because of the scarcity of terrestrial food resources.<ref name=sd2007>{{Cite news | last1=Stirling | first1=Ian | last2=Derocher | first2=Andrew E. | publication-date=Fall 2007 | title=Melting Under Pressure: The Real Scoop on Climate Warming and Polar Bears | periodical=The Wildlife Professional | publication-place=Lawrence, Kansas | publisher=The Wildlife Society | volume=1 | issue=3 | pages=24<U+2013>27, 43 | url=http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/andrew_derocher/uploads/abstracts/Stirling_Derocher_Wildlife_Professional_PB_climate_2007.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=17 November 2007}}</ref> An additional risk to the species is that if individuals spend more time on land, they will hybridize with brown or grizzly bears.<ref name=acia/> The IUCN wrote: {{cquote|Polar bears exhibit low reproductive rates with long generational spans. These factors make facultative adaptation by polar bears to significantly reduced ice coverage scenarios unlikely. Polar bears did adapt to warmer climate periods of the past. Due to their long generation time and the current greater speed of global warming, it seems unlikely that polar bear will be able to adapt to the current warming trend in the Arctic. If climatic trends continue polar bears may become extirpated from most of their range within 100 years.<ref name=iucn/>}}

===Controversy over species protection===

[[Image:Polar Bear at Central Park Zoo, Manhattan.JPG|right|thumb|Polar bear at Central Park Zoo, New York City, USA]]

Warnings about the future of the polar bear are often contrasted with the fact that worldwide population estimates have increased over the past 50 years and are relatively stable today.<ref name="usfwsa">{{cite web|url=http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/polarbear/pbmain.htm|title=Marine Mammals Management: Polar Bear|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska|accessdate=9 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=WWF>{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/area/species/polarbear/population/ |title=WWF <U+2013> Polar bear status, distribution & population|accessdate=22 March 2010 |publisher=World Wildlife Foundation}}</ref> Some estimates of the global population are around 5,000<U+2013>10,000 in the early 1970s;<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/27/world/americas/27bears.html |title= Bear Hunting Caught in Global Warming Debate |accessdate=11 March 2008 | last = Krauss | first = Clifford|work= New York Times | date=27 May 2006}}</ref> other estimates were 20,000<U+2013>40,000 during the 1980s.<ref name=distribution/><ref name="stirling1988">{{Cite book | last = Stirling | first = Ian | author-link=Ian Stirling | year = 1988 | title =Polar Bears | place =Ann Arbor | publisher =University of Michigan Press | isbn =0-472-10100-5}}</ref> Current estimates put the global population at between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name="PBSG14" />

There are several reasons for the apparent discordance between past and projected population trends: Estimates from the 1950s and 1960s were based on stories from explorers and hunters rather than on scientific surveys.<ref name=increasing>{{cite web |url=http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/ask-the-experts/population/ |title= Ask the Experts: Are Polar Bear Populations Increasing?

In an meeting of the five circumpolar nations on 6 September 1965, estimates of the worldwide population ranged from 5,000 to 19,000. "The truth was, no one knew... Scientific research had been sketchy and knowledge of the polar bear was based largely on stories brought back by explorers and hunters."</ref> Second, controls of harvesting were introduced that allowed this previously overhunted species to recover.<ref name=increasing/> Third, the recent effects of global warming have affected sea ice abundance in different areas to varying degrees.<ref name=increasing/> According to [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] data, only 1 out of the 19 polar bear [[subpopulation]]s is currently known to be increasing; 3 are stable; 8 are declining; and the remaining 7 currently have insufficient data to provide an assessment of population trends.<ref name="WWF"/>

Debate over the listing of the polar bear under endangered species legislation has put conservation groups and Canada's [[Inuit]] at opposing positions;<ref name=campbell/> the [[Nunavut]] government and many northern residents have condemned the U.S. initiative to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nunavut MLAs condemn U.S. proposal to make polar bears threatened species  | publisher = CBC News |date=4 June 2007 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2007/06/04/nu-pbear.html | accessdate = 15 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Inuit reject U.S. Polar Bear Proposal  | publisher = CBC News |date=21 June 2007 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2007/06/21/polar-bears.html | accessdate = 15 September 2007 }}</ref> Many Inuit believe the polar bear population is increasing, and restrictions on sport-hunting are likely to lead to a loss of income to their communities.<ref name=campbell/><ref name='nrf_wenzel'>Northern Research Forum.

===U.S. endangered species legislation===
On 14 May 2008 the U.S. Department of the Interior listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, citing the melting of Arctic sea ice as the primary threat to the polar bear.<ref name=hassett>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=533276|title=Bush's polar bear legal disaster|last=Hassett|first=Kevin A|date=23 May 2008|work=National Post|accessdate=7 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529045348/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=533276 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 May 2008}}</ref> However, the department immediately issued a statement that the listing could not be used to regulate [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, saying, "That would be a wholly inappropriate use of the Endangered Species Act. ESA is not the right tool to set U. S. climate policy."<ref>Quotation from Interior Secretary [[Dirk Kempthorne]], in {{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=533276|title=Bush's polar bear legal disaster|last=Hassett|first=Kevin A|date=23 May 2008|work=National Post|accessdate=7 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529045348/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=533276 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 29 May 2008}}</ref> However, some policy analysts believe that despite the government's stance, the Endangered Species Act can be used to restrict the issuing of federal permits for projects that would threaten the polar bear by increasing greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=hassett/> Environmental groups have pledged to go to court to have the Endangered Species Act interpreted in such a way.<ref name=hassett/> On 8 May 2009, the new administration of Barack Obama announced that it would continue the policy.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/washington/story/67800.html U.S. to keep Bush administration rule on polar bears], McClatchy Newspapers, 8 May 2009</ref>

While listing the polar bear as a threatened species, the Interior Department added a seldom-used stipulation to allow oil and gas exploration and development to proceed in areas inhabited by polar bears, provided companies continue to comply with the existing restrictions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<ref name =barringer/> The main new protection for polar bears under the terms of the listing is that hunters will no longer be able to import trophies from the hunting of polar bears in Canada.<ref name="barringer">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/us/15polar.html?fta=y|title=Polar Bear Is Made a Protected Species|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=15 May 2008|work=New York Times|accessdate=7 June 2008}}</ref>

The polar bear is only the third species, after the [[elkhorn coral]] and the [[staghorn coral]] protected under the Endangered Species Act due to global warming. In 4 August 2008, the state of Alaska sued U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, seeking to reverse the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species, out of concern that the listing would adversely affect oil and gas development in the state.<ref name="Joling">{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080805.wpolarbears0805/BNStory/International/|title=Alaska sues over listing polar bear as threatened|last=Joling|first=Dan|date=5 August 2008|work=Globe and Mail|accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] said that the listing was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available, a view rejected by polar bear experts.<ref name=Joling/>

The ruling followed several years of controversy. On 17 February 2005 the [[Center for Biological Diversity]] filed a petition asking that the polar bear be listed  under the Endangered Species Act. An agreement was reached and filed in Federal district court on 5 June 2006. Pursuant to that agreement, on 9 January 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to list the polar bear as a threatened species. A final decision was required by law by 9 January 2008, at which time the agency said it needed another month.<ref name=josef/>

On 7 March 2008, the inspector general of the U.S. Interior Department began a preliminary investigation into why the decision had been delayed for nearly two months.<ref name=josef>

===Canadian endangered species legislation===
In Canada, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] recommended in April 2008 that the polar bear be assessed as a [[species of special concern]] under the federal [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA). A listing would mandate that a management plan be written within five years, a timeline criticized by the World Wide Fund for Nature as being too long to prevent significant habitat loss from climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=eaeb2409-16eb-4227-9fca-0e6e955917c8&k=98911|title=Experts seek more protection for polar bears|last=Brach|first=Bal|date=25 April 2008|publisher= Canwest News Service|accessdate=9 May 2008}}</ref>

==In culture==
[[Image:PolarBearWalrusTuskCarving.jpg|right|thumb|This engraving, made by [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] carvers in the 1940s on a [[walrus]] tusk, depicts polar bears hunting walrus.]]

===Indigenous folklore===
For the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, polar bears have long played an important cultural and material role.<ref name=lw6-9>Lockwood, pp 6<U+2013>9</ref><ref name=Uspensky/> Polar bear remains have been found at hunting sites dating to 2,500 to 3,000 years ago<ref name=lw31-36>Lockwood, pp. 31<U+2013>36</ref> and 1,500 year old [[cave painting]]s of polar bears have been found in [[Chukotka]].<ref name=Uspensky/> Indeed, it has been suggested that Arctic peoples' skills in seal hunting and [[igloo]] construction has been in part acquired from the polar bears themselves.<ref name=Uspensky/>

The [[Inuit]] and [[Eskimo]]s have many [[Folklore|folk tales]] featuring the bears including legends in which bears are humans when inside their own houses and put on bear hides when going outside, and stories of how the [[constellation]] which is said to resemble a great bear surrounded by dogs came into being.<ref name=original>{{cite book|last=Stirling |first= Ian |year=1988 |title= Polar Bears |location= Ann Arbor |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-10100-5 |chapter= The Original Polar Bear Watchers}}</ref> These legends reveal a deep respect for the polar bear, which is portrayed as both spiritually powerful and closely akin to humans.<ref name=original/> The human-like posture of bears when standing and sitting, and the resemblance of a skinned bear carcass to the human body, have probably contributed to the belief that the spirits of humans and bears were interchangeable.<ref name=original/> Eskimo legends tell of humans learning to hunt from the polar bear. For the Inuit of Labrador, the polar bear is a form of the Great Spirit, Tuurngasuk.<ref>balisunset, (2008, 8 22). The Bear in Myth, Mythology and Folklore. Retrieved 29 June 2009, from Socyberty > Folklore Web site: http://www.socyberty.com/Folklore/The-Bear-in-Myth-Mythology-and-Folklore.222065/1</ref> The Inuit and Eskimo have a great amount of respect for bears.

Among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Siberian Yupik|Yupik]] of eastern [[Siberia]], there was [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|a longstanding shamanistic ritual]] of "thanksgiving" to the hunted polar bear. After killing the animal, its head and skin were removed and cleaned and brought into the home, a feast was held in the hunting camp in its honor. In order to appease the spirit of the bear, there were traditional song and drum music and the skull would be ceremonially fed and offered a pipe.<ref>{{cite paper |author=Kochnev AA, Etylin VM, Kavry VI, Siv-Siv EB, Tanko IV |title=Ritual Rites and Customs of the Natives of Chukotka connected with the Polar Bear|pages=1<U+2013>3|publisher=Preliminary report submitted for the meeting of the Alaska Nanuuq Commission (Nome, Alaska, USA) |date=December 17<U+2013>19, 2002}}</ref> Only once the spirit was appeased would the skull be separated from the skin, taken beyond the bounds of the homestead, and placed in the ground, facing north.<ref name=Uspensky/> Many of these traditions have faded somewhat in time, especially in light of the total hunting ban in the [[Soviet Union]] (and now Russia) since 1955.

The [[Nenet]]s of north-central Siberia placed particular value on the talismanic power of the prominent [[canine teeth]]. They were traded in the villages of the lower [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] and [[Khatanga River|Khatanga]] rivers to the forest-dwelling peoples further south, who would sew them into their hats as protection against [[brown bear]]s. It was believed that the "little nephew" (the brown bear) would not dare to attack a man wearing the tooth of its powerful "big uncle" (the polar bear).<ref name=Uspensky/> The skulls of killed polar bears were buried at specific sacred sites and altars, called ''sedyangi'', were constructed out of the skulls. Several such sites have been preserved on the [[Yamal Peninsula]].<ref name=Uspensky/>

===Symbols and mascots===

[[Image:Coat of Arms of Chukotka.png|100px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] in the Russian Federation.]]


Their distinctive appearance and their association with the Arctic have made polar bears popular icons, especially in those areas where they are native. The Canadian [[Toonie]] (two-dollar coin) features the image of a polar bear and both the [[Vehicle registration plates of Northwest Territories|Northwest Territories]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Nunavut|Nunavut license plates]] in Canada are in the shape of a polar bear. The polar bear is the mascot of [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Maine]] and the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (see also [[Alaska Nanooks]]) and was chosen as mascot for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Calgary]].

Companies such [[Coca-Cola]], [[Polar Beverages]], [[Nelvana]], [[Bundaberg Rum]] and [[Klondike bar|Good Humor-Breyers]] have used images of the polar bear in advertising,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/flash/home.htm |title=Bundaberg Rum website <U+2013> history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website}}</ref> while [[Fox's Glacier Mints]] have featured a polar bear named Peppy as the brand mascot since 1922.

===Literature===
Polar bears are also popular in fiction, particularly in books aimed at children or young adults. For example, ''The Polar Bear Son'' is adapted from a [[Inuit mythology|traditional Inuit tale]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Polar Bear Son: An Inuit Tale |last=Dabcovich |first=Lydia |year=1997 |publisher=Clarion Books |location=New York |isbn=0-395-72766-9}}</ref> Polar bears feature prominently in ''[[East (novel)|East]]'' (also released as ''North Child'') by [[Edith Pattou]], ''The Bear'' by [[Raymond Briggs]], and [[Chris d'Lacey]]'s ''[[The Fire Within (novel)|The Fire Within]]'' series. The ''[[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Armoured Bears (panserbj<U+00F8>rne)|panserbj<U+00F8>rne]]'' of [[Philip Pullman|Philip Pullman's]] fantasy trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' are sapient, dignified polar bears who exhibit [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities, and as such feature prominently in the 2007 [[The Golden Compass (film)|film adaptation of ''The Golden Compass'']].
