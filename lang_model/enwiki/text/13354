The '''Columbia River''' is the largest [[river]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]].<ref>According to the United States Geological Survey fact sheet, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/pdf/ofr87242.pdf "Largest Rivers in the United States"], "Rivers are considered large on the basis of one or more of three characteristics: total length from source to mouth, area of basin (watershed) drained by the stream, and average rate of flow (discharge) at the mouth." The Columbia is the largest river of the Pacific Northwest in all three senses.</ref> The river [[Headwater#Related_usages|rises]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], flows northwest and then south into the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington]], then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of [[Oregon]] before emptying into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The river is {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long. Its [[drainage basin]] is roughly the size of [[France]] and extends into seven U.S. states and a Canadian province.

By volume, the Columbia is the fourth-largest river in the U.S., and it has the greatest flow of any North American river draining into the Pacific. The river's heavy flow and its relatively steep gradient give it tremendous potential for the generation of electricity. The [[Hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River|14&nbsp;hydroelectric dams]] on the Columbia's [[main stem]] and many more on its tributaries produce more [[hydroelectric power]] than those of any other North American river.

The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the many cultural groups of the region. The river system hosts many species of [[anadromous]] fish, which migrate between [[freshwater]] habitats and the [[Saline water|saline]] Pacific Ocean. These fish<U+2014>especially the [[salmon]] species<U+2014>provided the core subsistence for natives; in past centuries, traders from across western North America traveled to the Columbia to trade for fish.

In the late 18th&nbsp;century, a private American ship became the first to enter the river from the Pacific Ocean; it was followed by a British explorer, who navigated past the [[Oregon Coast Range]] into the [[Willamette Valley]]. In the following decades, [[fur trade|fur trading]] companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic and treacherous [[Columbia River Gorge]], and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers, following both routes to enter it.  [[Steamship]]s along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th&nbsp;century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.

Since the late 19th&nbsp;century, [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector|private]] sectors have heavily developed the river. The development, commonly referred to as taming or harnessing of the river, has been massive and multi-faceted. To aid ship and barge navigation, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and [[dredging]] has opened, maintained, and enlarged [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]]. Since the early 20th&nbsp;century, dams have been built across the river for the purposes of power generation, navigation, [[irrigation]], and flood control. Today, a dam-impounded [[reservoir]] occupies nearly every U.S. mile of the once free-flowing river, and much of the Canadian stretch has been impounded as well. Production of [[nuclear power]] has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for [[nuclear weapon]]s was produced for decades at the [[Hanford Site]], which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the U.S. All these developments have had a tremendous impact on river environments, perhaps most notably through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.

==Course==
The Columbia begins its {{convert|1243|mi|km|adj=on}} journey in the southern [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in British Columbia (BC). [[Columbia Lake]], {{convert|2690|ft|m|}} above [[sea level]], and the adjoining [[Columbia Wetlands]] form the river's [[headwaters]]. The trench is a broad, deep, and long [[glacial valley]] between the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[Columbia Mountains]] in BC. For its first {{convert|200|mi|km|}}, the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through [[Windermere Lake (British Columbia)|Windermere Lake]] and the town of [[Invermere, British Columbia|Invermere]], a region known in BC as the [[Columbia Valley]], then northwest to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and into [[Kinbasket Lake]]. Rounding the northern end of the [[Selkirk Mountains]], the river turns sharply south through a region known as the [[Big Bend Country]], passing through [[Revelstoke Lake]] and the [[Arrow Lakes]]. Revelstoke, the Big Bend, and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the [[Columbia Country]]. Below the Arrow Lakes, the Columbia passes the cities of [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], located at the Columbia's [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Kootenay River]], and [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], two major centres of the [[West Kootenay]] region. The [[Pend Oreille River]] joins the Columbia about {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of the [[Canada <U+2013> United States border|U.S.<U+2013>Canada border]].<ref name="atlas of canada">{{cite web

This C-shaped segment of the river is also known as the "Big Bend". During the [[Missoula Floods]] 10,000 to 15,000&nbsp;years ago, much of the floodwater took a more direct route south, forming the ancient river bed known as the [[Grand Coulee]]. After the floods, the river found its present course, and the Grand Coulee was left dry. The construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the mid-20th&nbsp;century impounded the river, forming [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Lake Roosevelt]], from which water was pumped into the dry [[coulee]], forming the [[reservoir]] of [[Banks Lake]].<ref name="basinproj">{{cite web

The river flows past [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]], a prominent concert venue in the Northwest, then through [[Priest Rapids Dam]], and then through the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Nuclear Reservation]]. Entirely within the reservation is [[Hanford Reach]], the only U.S. stretch of the river that is completely free-flowing, unimpeded by dams and not a tidal [[estuary]]. The [[Snake River]] and [[Yakima River]] join the Columbia in the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] population center.

The [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] joins the Columbia near [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]]. Between The Dalles and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the river cuts through the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], forming the dramatic [[Columbia River Gorge]].

The headwaters and upper courses of the [[Klamath River]] and [[Pit River]] flow through much of the Cascades; in contrast the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds, scenic beauty, and its role as an important transportation link.<ref>{{cite web

In the 18th&nbsp;century, there was strong interest in discovering a [[Northwest Passage]] that would permit navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to [[Hudson Bay]] or the [[Missouri River]]. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of [[Bruno de Heceta]], who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On the advice of his officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it ''Ensenada de Asunci<U+00F3>n''. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled ''Rio de San Roque'',<ref name="HistLinkGray"/> or an entrance, called ''Entrada de Hezeta''.<ref name="Hayes"/> Following Heceta's reports, British explorer Captain [[John Meares]] searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cape Disappointment State Park |url = http://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/caped.htm |date = 2006  | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref>  He named [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]] for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.<ref>Denton, V.L.

What happened next would form the basis for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of, and ownership claim to, the region. [[Royal Navy]] commander [[George Vancouver]] sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water's color, but he accepted Meares' report and continued on his journey northward.<ref name="HistLinkGray"/> Later that month, Vancouver encountered the [[United States|American]] captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] at the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]].

Because the Columbia was at the same latitude as the headwaters of the [[Missouri River]], there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri.<ref name="Hayes"/> However, when the American explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] charted the vast, unmapped lands of the [[American West]] in their [[Lewis and Clark expedition|overland expedition]] (1803<U+2013>05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]], Lewis and Clark built [[dugout canoe]]s and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as [[Bateman Island]], before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing [[Fort Clatsop]], a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.<ref name="Hayes"/>

[[Canada|Canadian]] explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], of the [[North West Company]], spent the winter of 1807<U+2013>08 at [[Kootenae House]] near the source of the Columbia at present-day [[Invermere, British Columbia]]. Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries. In 1811, he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean, arriving at the mouth just after [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[Pacific Fur Company]] had founded Astoria. On his return to the north, Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not yet seen, becoming the first European-American to travel the entire length of the river.<ref name="Hayes"/>

In 1825 the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) established [[Fort Vancouver]] on the bank of the Columbia, in what is now [[Vancouver, Washington]], as the headquarters of the company's [[Columbia District]], which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. [[John McLoughlin]], a physician, was appointed [[Factor (agent)|Chief Factor]] of the Columbia District.

In the [[Treaty of 1818]] the United States and Britain agreed that both nations were to enjoy equal rights in [[Oregon Country]] for 10&nbsp;years. By 1828, when the so-called "joint occupation" was renewed for an indefinite period, it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border. For years the Hudson's Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off. In the 1830s, however, American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region. And in the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade, which was in sharp decline, to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber. Colonization schemes were attempted, but failed to match the scale of American settlement. Americans generally settled south of the Columbia, mainly in the Willamette Valley. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river, but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley. The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American flavor of the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers.  These developments rekindled the issue of "joint occupation" and the [[oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]].  While some British interests, especially the Hudson's Bay Company, fought for a boundary along the Columbia River, the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th&nbsp;parallel.  The Columbia River did become the border between the U.S. territories of [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]] and [[Washington Territory|Washington]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Meinig |first= D.W. |authorlink= D.W.

===Opening the passage to Lewiston===
As early as 1881, industrialists proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation.<ref name="opbtimeline"/> Changes to the river over the years have included the construction of [[jetty|jetties]] at the river's mouth, [[dredging]], and the construction of [[canal]]s and [[locks (water transport)|navigation locks]]. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as [[Lewiston, Idaho]].<ref name="ccrh-hist"/>

The shifting Columbia Bar makes passage between the river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous, and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation. Jetties, first constructed in 1886,<ref name="opbtimeline"/> extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties. 

In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping. The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from {{convert|17|ft|m}} to {{convert|25|ft|m}}. ''[[The Columbian]]'' called for the channel to be deepened to {{convert|40|ft|m}} as early as 1905, but that depth was not attained until 1976.<ref>{{cite news

Many farmers in central Washington build dams on their property for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may be as many as a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.<ref>{{cite news

===Fish migration===
{{see also|Environmental impacts of dams}}

The Columbia supports several species of [[anadromous]] fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and fresh water tributaries of the river. [[Coho salmon|Coho]] and [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] (also known as "king") salmon, and [[steelhead]], all of the genus [[Oncorhynchus]], are ocean fish that migrate up the rivers at the end of their life cycles to spawn.<ref>{{cite web | title = Managing the Columbia River system to help fish| publisher = Bonneville Power Administration | url =  http://www.bpa.gov/corporate/pubs/backgrounder/06/bg120106.pdf  | date = 2006 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref> [[White sturgeon]], which take 15 to 25&nbsp;years to mature, typically migrate between the ocean and the upstream habitat several times during their lives.<ref>{{cite web| title = White Sturgeon | url = http://www.psmfc.org/habitat/edu_wsturg_fact.html | publisher = Pacific Coast Marine Habitat Program | date = 1996 | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref>

Salmon populations declined dramatically after the establishment of canneries in 1867. By 1908, there was widespread concern about the decline of salmon and sturgeon. In that year, the people of Oregon passed two laws under their newly instituted program of [[Oregon System|Citizens' Initiatives]] limiting fishing on the Columbia and other rivers.<ref>{{cite book

Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations of salmon die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ [[fish ladder]]s, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mueller | first=Ted | title=Fire, Faults, and Floods: A Road and Trail Guide Exploring the Origins of the Columbia River Basin | publisher=University of Idaho Press | location=Moscow, Idaho | year=1997 | page=229 | isbn = 9780893012069}}</ref> In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The [[Chief Joseph Dam]] and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.<ref>{{cite web|title = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon | url = http://www.uppercolumbiasturgeon.org/ | publisher = Upper Columbia White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative | 2007| accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref> 

Not all fish have suffered from the modifications to the river; the [[northern pikeminnow]] (formerly known as the ''squawfish'') thrives in the warmer, slower water created by the dams. Research in the mid-1980s found that juvenile salmon were suffering substantially from the predatory pikeminnow,<ref>{{cite web

===Pollution===
In southeastern Washington, a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the river passes through the [[Hanford Site]], established in 1943 as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The site served as a [[plutonium]] production complex, with nine [[nuclear reactor]]s and related facilities located on the banks of the river. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived [[isotope]]s were not affected by this retention, and several [[becquerel|terabecquerels]] entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000&nbsp;[[curie]]s of radioactive material into the Columbia.<ref>{{cite web | last = Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility | title = Hanford History | date = 2007<U+2013>2008| url = http://www.wpsr.org/history/ | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref> These releases were kept secret by the federal government until the release of declassified documents in the late 1980s.<ref name="HHIN">{{cite web | last = Hanford Health Information Network |year = 2000 | title = An Overview of Hanford and Radiation Health Effects | url = http://www.doh.wa.gov/hanford/publications/overview/overview.html | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref> Radiation was measured downstream as far west as the Washington and [[Oregon]] coasts.<ref>{{cite news | title = Radiation Flowed 200 Miles to Sea, Study Finds | work = The New York Times | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D8173FF934A25754C0A964958260 | date = 1992-07-17 | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref>

Studies have also found significant levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality is also an important factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including [[Superfund]] projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake|Lake Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite web | last = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | title = Columbia River Basin: A National Priority | year = 2008| url = http://www.epa.gov/region10/columbia EPA report on the Columbia | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}</ref>

Timber industry activity further contaminates river water, notably in the increased sediment runoff that results from [[clearcutting|clearcuts]].

The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) divides the waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three [[Ecoregion#Freshwater|freshwater ecoregions]], naming them: Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up about a third of the total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]]. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay Rivers. The effects of [[glacier|glaciation]] include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above [[Shoshone Falls]], which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14&nbsp;species of fish, many of which are [[endemism|endemic]]. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35&nbsp;species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.<ref>{{cite book |last= Abell |first= Robin A. |coauthors= David M. Olsen, Eric Dinerstein, Patrick T.

In 2000, about six million people lived within the Columbia' drainage basin. Of this total about 2.4&nbsp;million people lived in Oregon, 1.7&nbsp;million in Washington, 1&nbsp;million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4&nbsp;million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10&nbsp;million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the [[Interstate 5|I-5]] corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around [[Spokane, Washington]], and [[Boise, Idaho]]. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are growing rapidly. The central Oregon county of [[Deschutes County, Oregon|Deschutes]] is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing just east of the Cascades in central Washington around the city of [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior.

Climate varies greatly from place to place within the watershed. Elevation ranges from [[sea level]] at the river mouth to more than {{convert|14000|ft|m}} in the mountains, and temperatures vary with elevation. The highest peak is [[Mount Rainier]], at {{convert|14411|ft|m}}. High elevations have cold winters and short cool summers; interior regions are subject to great temperature variability and severe droughts.

Several major North American drainage basins and many minor ones share a common border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the [[Continental Divide]] separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]-[[Missouri River|Missouri]] watershed, which empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and [[Alberta]], the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the [[Nelson River|Nelson]]-[[Lake Winnipeg]]-[[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] watershed, which empties into [[Hudson Bay]]. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the [[Laurentian Divide]], which meets the Continental Divide at [[Triple Divide Peak]] near the headwaters of the Columbia's [[Flathead River]] tributary.

===Major tributaries===

The river and the low hills are in shade, while the hilltops and a large hillside in the foreground are sunlit.| [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]] at its confluence with the Columbia]]
The Columbia receives more than 60&nbsp;significant [[tributary|tributaries]]. The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia (measured either by [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or by size of watershed) are the [[Snake River]] (mostly in [[Idaho]]), the [[Willamette River]] (in northwest Oregon), the [[Kootenay River]] (mostly in British Columbia), and the [[Pend Oreille River]] (mostly in northern Washington and Idaho, also known as the lower part of the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]]). Each of these four averages more than {{convert|20000|cuft/s|m3/s}} and drains an area of more than {{convert|20000|mi2|km2}}.

The Snake is by far the largest tributary. Its watershed of {{convert|108000|mi2|km2}} is larger than the state of Idaho. Its discharge is nearly equal (about 46.5%) to the Columbia's at the rivers' confluence. Compared to the Columbia above the confluence, the Snake is longer (113%), and its drainage basin is larger (104%).

The Pend Oreille river system (including its main tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its discharge over a third (37%).<ref name="wdr2007us">Calculated mainly with data from: {{cite web|url=http://wdr.water.usgs.gov/wy2007/search.jsp|title=Water-resources data for the United States, Water Year 2007|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>
