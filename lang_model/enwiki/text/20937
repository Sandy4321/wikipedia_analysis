{{Cuisine of Britain}}
'''Cornish cuisine''' encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with [[Cornwall]]. It has been heavily influenced by the [[Geography of Cornwall|geography]] of the county as well as its [[History of Cornwall|social history]].

Cornwall being a [[peninsula]] surrounded by seas historically well-stocked with fish has meant that fish dishes form a major part of the historical and modern recipes in Cornwall. The [[Fishing in Cornwall|fishing industry]] has played a major part in the [[Economy of Cornwall|economy]] of the county. The iconic dish of Cornwall,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cornish pasties can<U+2019>t be pirated|url=http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/02/22/cornish-pasties-can%E2%80%99t-be-pirated-3/|publisher=[[DEFRA]]|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=22 February 2011}}</ref> the [[pasty]], has its roots in another historical industry within the county, this being [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|mining]]. 

Certain Cornish food dishes have been granted [[protected geographical status]] under [[European Union law|EU law]], ensuring that they can only be labelled and marketed as "Cornish" if they are produced and mainly sourced within Cornwall.<ref>{{cite web|title=EU Protected Food Names - UK registered names |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/industry/regional/foodname/products/registered/index.htm|publisher=[[DEFRA]]|accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref>

Cornwall has influenced and been influenced by other [[British cuisine]], as well as having similarities with [[Cuisine of Devon|the cuisine]] of its neighbour, [[Devon]].

Cornwall has a strong culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; [[Newlyn]] is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fishing Industry Leaders Back Objective One Investment|url=http://www.objectiveone.com/client/media/media-611.htm|publisher=The Objective One Partnership|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=30 August 2005}}</ref>

Traditional dishes in the [[Lizard Peninsula]] are described in a pamphlet published in 1980. These include breakfast of "gerty milk" (bread and milk) with tea or cocoa; pasties made of pastry, turnip, potatoes, beef and onion; boiled beef; squab pie of apples, onions and salt pork; "scrowled pilchards" (grilled over the fire on an iron plate); and "heavy cake".<ref>Meneage and Lizard Oral History Group (ed.) (1980) ''Traditional Life in the Far South West''. [N. pl.]: the Group; pp. 15-20</ref> 

Cornish food and drink was promoted in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in April 2009 following intervention from [[Mark Prisk]] MP, then Shadow Minister for Cornwall, as part of the Commons plans for a South West regional food week.<ref>{{cite news|last=Laurie|first=Stocks-Moore|title=Chester businessman<U+2019>s campaign to get Cornish pasties into Parliament|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/local-chester-news/2009/04/27/chester-businessman-s-campaign-to-get-cornish-pasties-into-parliament-59067-23484216/|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=Chester Chroniclee|date=27 April 2009}}</ref>

===Fish dishes===

Larger commercial producers of characteristically Cornish products include the bakers [[Ginsters]] and [[Warrens Bakery]], and the creameries Davidstow Creamery and Rodda's of Scorrier.
Television chef [[Rick Stein]] has long operated a fish restaurant in [[Padstow]] for this reason, and in 2006 [[Jamie Oliver]] opened his second restaurant, [[Fifteen (restaurant)|Fifteen Cornwall]], in [[Watergate Bay]] near [[Newquay]]. ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, [[John Torode]], in 2007 purchased Seiners in [[Perranporth]]. One famous local fish dish is [[Stargazy pie]], a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though "star-gazing". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for [[Tom Bawcock's Eve]].

===Pasties===

{{Main|Pasty}}
Cornwall is perhaps best known though for its pasties, a savoury baked dish made from [[pastry]]. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and swede with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. "Turmut, 'tates and mate" (i.e. Turnip, potatoes and meat) describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots.<ref>http://www.alanrichards.org/cornish3.htm - Cornish recipe site</ref> Pasties are often locally referred to as ''oggies''. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries.<ref name=Martin>{{cite book| last=Martin | first=Edith | title=Cornish Recipes, Ancient & Modern|edition= 22nd, 1965|year=1929 }}</ref> The Pasty Shop<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pasty Shop Website|url=http://www.thepastyshop.com|publisher=The Pasty Shop|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> and West Cornwall Pasty<ref>{{cite web|title=West Cornwall Pasty Website|url=http://www.westcornwallpasty.co.uk/|publisher=West Cornwall Pasty|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> are just two Cornish chains that have popularised traditional oggies around the UK.

===Meat pies===
[[Squab pie]] is a traditional dish from [[South West England]], with early records showing it was commonly eaten in [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]] and [[Gloucestershire]]. Although the name suggests it should contain [[squab (food)|squab]] (young [[domestic pigeon]]), it in fact contains [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] and [[apples]]. The pie has become popular around the world, though outside South West England, it generally does contain pigeon.

In recent times [[Ginsters]] bakery has become a large-scale producer of meat pies.

===Dairy products===
[[File:Davidstow Creamery - geograph.org.uk - 730296.jpg|thumb|left|Davidstow Creamery]]
The wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops (e.g. wheat and rye).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} However, it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading to the production of Cornwall's other famous export, [[clotted cream]]. This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish [[fudge]] and Cornish [[ice cream]]. Cornish clotted cream is protected under EU law,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cornish Clotted Cream Denomination Information|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=271|work=Agriculture and Rural Development|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is Rodda's, based at [[Scorrier]].

;Cheese
[[File:Welsh hewa cakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Heavy (hewa) cakes]]
[[Yarg]] is a semi-hard [[cow's milk]] [[cheese]] made in Cornwall. Before being left to mature, this cheese is carefully wrapped in [[nettle]] leaves to form an edible, though mouldy, rind. The texture varies from creamy and soft immediately under the nettle coating to a [[Caerphilly cheese]]-like crumbly texture in the middle. Modern production is at Pengreep Farm near [[Truro]], by Lynher Dairies from an old recipe. Lynher Dairies also make Cornish Garland and Tiskey Meadow. Menallack and Nanterrow cheeses are made at Menallack Farm near Penryn.<ref>Freeman, Sarah (1998) ''The Real Cheese Companion''. London: Little, Brown; (Cornish cheeses; pp. 115-127)</ref>

Davidstow and [[Cathedral City Cheddar]] cheeses are produced at [[Davidstow]] by [[Dairy Crest]], using water ultimately from [[Saint David|St David]]'s Holy Well, next to the parish church. [[St Erth]] was the site of a large creamery operated by [[United Dairies]]: this was responsible for processing a large quantity of milk produced in Penwith. Cornish Blue is a cheese made by the Cornish Cheese Company at [[Upton Cross, Cornwall|Upton Cross]] and was recognised in December 2010 as the winning cheese in the World Cheese Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12085526|publisher=BBC News|title=Blue cheese made world champion|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> [[Gevrik]] is a soft, full-fat [[goat's milk cheese]] produced in [[Trevarrian]] near Newquay. The name means "little goat" in [[Cornish language|Cornish]].<ref>[http://www.gourmetbritain.com/encyclo_entry.php?item=6748 Gourmet Britain - Encyclopedia - Gevrik<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Cakes, sweet dishes and fruit===
[[File:Cornish fairings.jpg|thumb|Traditional Cornish fairings]]
Local cakes and desserts include [[Saffron bun|Saffron cake]], [[Heavy cake|heavy (''hevva'') cake]] (also known as [[Welsh cakes]]), [[Cornish fairing|fairing]] biscuits, figgy 'obbin [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Figgie_'obbin], scones (often served with jam and clotted cream) and [[Vaccinium myrtillus|whortleberry]] pie.<ref name="Mason, Laura 1999">Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) ''From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith''. Totnes: Prospect Books</ref><ref name="Pettigrew, Jane 2004">Pettigrew, Jane (2004) ''Afternoon Tea''. Andover: Jarrold</ref><ref name="Fitzgibbon, Theodora 1972">Fitzgibbon, Theodora (1972) ''A Taste of England: the West Country''. London: J. M. Dent</ref> Baking cakes using yeast is more common here than in the rest of England. The [[Cornish Gilliflower]] is a variety of apple tree found at Truro in 1813 which was afterwards grown commercially. Various fruit trees can be grown in Cornwall but it is not particularly suitable for this. Whortleberries and [[blackberries]] can be gathered in some rural areas and homegrown produce can be used for jam-making or puddings.

== Stoves and ovens ==
The Cornish stove (commonly known as the "slab") was found in most kitchens in west Cornwall. These stoves were supplied by a number of foundries in the district and were made of cast iron with brass knobs. The ironwork was kept looking fine with blacklead. The foundries included Sara, Jenkins & Barnicoat of [[Camborne]], Tippet, Terril & Rodgers of [[Redruth]], Luke's of [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], Hill's and Radmore & Dart at [[Truro]], Roberts's at [[Praze-An-Beeble|Praze]], and Toy's and Williams's at [[Helston]]. The doors to the firebox were either closed to heat the oven, or opened to provide a cheerful fire. Above the oven and firebox was the hotplate and some stoves had a built-in boiler to supply hot water. Once a week the blackleading would be renewed and the brasswork would be polished.<ref>Meneage and Lizard Oral History Group (ed.) (1980) ''Traditional Life in the Far South West''. [N. pl.]: the Group; pp. 5-6</ref> The exhibits of the St Ives Museum include a reconstruction of a traditional Cornish kitchen.<ref>Hudson, Kenneth & Nicholls, Ann (1987) ''The Cambridge Guide to the Museums of Britain and Ireland''. Cambridge University Press; p. 328</ref>

A [[clome oven]] (or '''cloam oven''') is a type of [[masonry oven]]. It has a removable door made of clay or alternatively a cast iron door, and was a standard fitting for most kitchen fireplaces in Cornwall and Devon. The oven would be built into the side of the chimney breast, often appearing as a round bulge in the chimney. This bulge consisted of the masonry surrounding the oven, and was intended to be dismantled should the oven ever need to be replaced. During installation, they are surrounded by packed clay to prevent the actual oven cracking.<ref> [http://telematics.ex.ac.uk/realcornwall/foodanddrink/display_image.asp?id=15&topic=Cornish%20Specialities 20 Cornish Specialities]</ref> As cast iron range cookers were brought into common use, it became standard practice to build a dividing wall to split the fireplace into two separate fireplaces, thus allowing access to the clome oven, as well as providing a space of the correct dimensions to fit a Cornish stove or similar. Bricks were the most common building material for this task, since the installation of a Cornish stove required a brick flue to be built up the back of the fireplace. Many clome ovens were preserved in situ in this way.

==Alcoholic beverages==
[[File:St Austell Brewery-by-Tony-Atkin.jpg|thumb|St Austell Brewery]]
There are many types of [[beer]]s brewed in Cornwall &ndash; those produced by [[Sharp's Brewery]], [[Skinner's Brewery]] and [[St Austell Brewery]] are the best-known &ndash; including [[stout]]s, [[ale]]s and other beer types. There is some small scale production of [[wine]], [[mead]] and [[cider]]. [[Spingo (beverage)|Spingo]] (meaning strong beer in [[Old English]]) is a generic name for a collection of beers brewed solely in the brewery of the Blue Anchor Inn in Coinage Hall Street, [[Helston]]. Cider was traditionally made for farmworkers but Cornwall is not particularly suited to apple growing. Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm near [[Truro]] brews and sells its own cider, brandy and country fruit wine produced on site.

==Overseas==
===Australia===
Cornish food, like the [[Cornish pasty]], is still popular amongst the [[Cornish Australian]] communities. Former premier of South Australia, [[Don Dunstan]], once took part in a pasty-making contest. [[Copper Coast Wines|Swanky beer]] and [[saffron cake]] were very popular in the past and have been revitalised by Kernewek Lowender and the Cornish Associations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kernewek Lowender <U+2013> the World<U+2019>s Largest Cornish Festival|url=http://www.cornwall24.net/magazine/kernewek-lowender-%E2%80%93-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-cornish-festival|publisher=Cornwall 24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=27 September 2010}}</ref>

In the 1880s Henry Madren Leggo, whose parents came from St Just, Cornwall, began making vinegar, pickles, sauces, cordials and other grocery goods based on his mother<U+2019>s traditional recipes. His company, now known as Leggo's, is wrongly believed by many to be Italian.<ref>{{cite web|title=London Cornish Association Newsletter, Spring 2010|url=http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/pdfs/spring10.PDF|publisher=London Cornish Association|accessdate=24 March 2011|page=6}}</ref>

A boutique brewery operation in South Australia, [[Copper Coast Wines]], produces traditional Cornish [[Swanky beer]], a [[Bottle conditioning|bottle conditioned]] beer, for the biennial [[Copper Coast]] region [[Kernewek Lowender]] Cornish Festival,<ref>{{cite web|title=About Swanky Beer|url=http://www.swankybeer.com.au/aboutus.asp|publisher=Swanky Beer|accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> held in May in alternate (odd numbered) years. The name ''Swanky Beer'' appears to refer to a Cornish home-brew. During the 19th century, many Cornish miners emigrated to the [[Copper Triangle]] region of [[South Australia]] to work in the copper mines at [[Moonta]]. They brought local traditions, such as [[pasty|Cornish pasties]] and [[homebrewing|home brewed]] beer they termed "Swanky beer",<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~tarry/frecipes_s.htm Hot Griddle Cakes and Cherry Sauce<!-- Bot generated title --><!-- Is this relavent?? -->]</ref> which was brewed from ingredients including: malted barley, hops, yeast, brown sugar, ginger, raisins and soft rainwater. It was put into beer bottles with the tops tied down with twine and stored in the coolest place in the house until ready. It was served on festive occasions, such as Easter, Midwinter's Night (Bonfire Night) and Christmas.

===United States===

In [[Cornish American]] communities some aspects of the cuisine are derived from Cornwall. At [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin]], it is claimed that authentic Cornish food, such as [[pasty|pasties]] and figgyhobbin, are served<ref>[http://pendarvis.wisconsinhistory.org/Visit/ShopsRestaurants.aspx "Pendarvis - Shops & Restaurants"]</ref> and Cornish pasties are sold at ex-Cornish mining towns in America.
The city of [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], California, holds [[St Piran's Day]] celebrations every year, which along with carol singing, includes a [[Saint Piran's Flag|flag]] raising ceremony, games involving the Cornish pasty, and [[Cornish wrestling]] competitions.<ref>[http://www.downtowngrassvalley.com/pages/st-pirans.html Grass Valley's St Pirans Day Celebration - DowntownGrassValley.com]</ref>
