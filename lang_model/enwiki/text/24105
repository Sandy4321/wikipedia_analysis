The '''Metropolitan Borough of Wigan''' is a [[metropolitan borough]] of [[Greater Manchester]], in [[North West England]]. It is named after its largest component town and [[County Borough of Wigan|former county borough]], [[Wigan]] and includes the towns and villages of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], part of [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]],  [[Ince-in-Makerfield]], [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]], [[Orrell, Greater Manchester|Orrell]], [[Standish, Greater Manchester|Standish]], [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]], [[Tyldesley]], [[Golborne]], [[Lowton]], [[Higher End| Billinge]], [[Astley, Greater Manchester|Astley]], [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]] and [[Aspull]]. The borough was formed in 1974 and is an [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of several former local government districts and parishes. The borough has three [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es and lies directly to the west of the [[City of Salford]] and southwest of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton]]. The local authority is [[Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council]].

==History==
Wigan metropolitan borough was created on 1 April 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. It was formed from the former [[county borough]] of Wigan along with other local government units from the administrative county of [[Lancashire]].<ref name=lga_1972>{{cite book|title=Local Government Act 1972.  1972 c. 60|publisher=HMSO}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Local Government (Successor Parishes) Order 1973. 1973/1110|publisher=HMSO}}</ref> These were the [[Municipal Borough of Leigh]], the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of Abram, Aspull, [[Atherton Urban District|Atherton]], [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]], Ince-in-Makerfield, [[Orrell, Greater Manchester|Orrell]], [[Standish, Greater Manchester|Standish]] and [[Tyldesley Urban District|Tyldesley]]. [[Ashton-in-Makerfield]] except for the parish of [[Seneley Green]], the [[Golborne Urban District]] except for the parish of [[Culcheth and Glazebury]] in Warrington, the [[Higher End]] part of [[Billinge and Winstanley Urban District]] and the civil parishes of [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]], [[Shevington]] and [[Worthington, Greater Manchester|Worthington]] from the [[Wigan Rural District]] were included.

Before its creation, the name Wigan-Leigh was used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]. It was suggested that the new metropolitan borough be named [[Makerfield]]. However both names were rejected by a vote of 12 to 2.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=101}}.</ref>
According to an opinion poll in 2003, 26% of 299 residents surveyed felt they belonged "very strongly" or "fairly strongly" (4% very strongly) to Greater Manchester, 64% (28% very strongly) to the borough of Wigan, and 63% (31% very strongly) to Lancashire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/Add58Wig_12198-9334__E__.pdf |title=MORI local government and identity opinion poll December 2003 - February 2004 |publisher=The Boundary Committee for England |accessdate=2007-02-11|format=PDF}}</ref>

The metropolitan borough was created from a highly industrialised area of Lancashire that was part of the [[Lancashire Coalfield]] and had an important textile industry.

==Geography==
Wigan borough covers an area of {{convert|77|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} and is the 9th largest metropolitan borough, out of 36, in England. The borough is the most north western in Greater Manchester.  Within Greater Manchester, it borders the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton]] to the north-east and east, and the [[City of Salford]] to the east. Outwith Greater Manchester, in the south it borders [[Warrington]] (a unitary authority in [[Cheshire]]); to the south-west it borders the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens]] in [[Merseyside]].  To the west it borders the [[West Lancashire]] borough, and to the north it borders the [[Chorley (borough)|Chorley]] borough, both in [[Lancashire]].

Wigan has four [[Local Nature Reserve]]s: Borsdane Wood between Hindley and Aspull, Orrell Water Park in Orrell, Wigan Flashes and Low Hall Park at Platt Bridge<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wlct.org/trustnews/news/tn_7109.htm| title=Fourth Local Nature Reserve Opens| publisher= Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust|accessdate= 3 February 2011}}</ref> as well as the 250 acre Haigh Country Park.

==Governance==

===Local government===
See also: [[Mayor of Wigan]] and [[Mayoress of Wigan]]

For 12&nbsp;years after the county was created in 1974, the borough had a two-tier system of [[local government in England|local government]], and [[Wigan Council]] shared power with the [[Greater Manchester County Council]]. The county council was abolished in 1986 by the [[Local Government Act 1985]]. In April 2011 the [[Greater Manchester Combined Authority]] became the top tier of local government within Greater Manchester covering  ten boroughs including Wigan.

The first [[United Kingdom local elections, 1973|elections]] to the borough council were held on 10 May 1973.<ref>{{cite news|title=Three major parties find cause for satisfaction in local election results despite low poll|work=The Times|date=1973-05-12}}</ref>  The Metropolitan Borough Council is divided into 25 wards, each of which elects three councillors. Elections are by third, with one councillor from each ward up for re-election in each election year.<ref name=lga_1972/>  The borough council has a leader and cabinet system. The current leader is [[Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh|Peter Smith]], who sits in the [[House of Lords]] as a Labour Party life peer with the title, Lord Smith of Leigh. He became leader in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/pub/council/constitution/part9.htm|title=Constitution: Part 9|publisher=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council}}</ref> The council rejected the idea of a [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly-elected mayor]] following a consultation in 2001.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://formby.wiganmbc.gov.uk/press/press2001/polmanagementresults.htm|title=Borough rejects elected mayor|date=2001-06-15 |accessdate=2001-06-15|publisher=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council}}</ref>

The Metropolitan Borough of Wigan is traditionally a Labour stronghold - the council has been Labour Party-controlled since its creation.<ref name=2006_poll>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2006/locals/html/bw.stm|title=Local elections: Wigan|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2007-02-11 | location=London}}</ref>  The [[Wigan Council election 1998|local elections in 1998]] resulted in a council with only 2 non-Labour members.

Labour had a majority with 43 seats at the 2006 election.  The second largest party was the local [[Community Action Party]] which had 15 seats.  Community Action first contested Wigan elections in 2002, and won 18 seats in the [[Wigan Council election 2004|2004 election]] following the re-warding - their councilors are for wards in the middle of the borough, between Wigan and Leigh.  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had nine seats, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] eight.<ref name=2006_poll /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3796633.stm|title=Labour licks wounds after polls |publisher=BBC News|date=2004-06-11 |accessdate=2004-06-11 | location=London}}</ref>

At the 2008 elections Labour was the largest party with 41 seats out of a total of 75, the Conservative Party had 14 seats, Community Action Party 8 seats, Independent 7 seats, Liberal Democrats 4 seats and one was vacant.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://kinnear.wigan.gov.uk/electionResults/Summary010508.htm|title=Summary of seats 2008 |publisher=Wigan MBC|accessdate=2010-03-01|ref=harv}}</ref>

As of November 2010 (after May elections), Labour was the largest party with 51 seats out of a total of 75, the Conservative Party had 8 seats, 7 Independent, Community Action Party 4 seats and Liberal Democrats  seats (1 member currently suspended)<ref>http://democracy.wigan.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=173</ref> and the 'Independent Conservative' members with 2 seats.

===Townships and wards===
The borough is divided into 25 electoral wards, each of which elect three councillors.  The present wards were adopted in 2003, following a review by the Boundary Commission, the previous review took place in 1979.  The borough was formerly divided in 24 wards.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk/files/dms/Wigan_f_10750-8582__E__.pdf|title=Final recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Wigan|publisher=Boundary Committee|date=September 2003|accessdate=2007-02-11|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wigan.gov.uk/pub/council/maps/wardmap.htm|title=New Wigan Wards Map|publisher=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council}}</ref> Wigan Council has divided the borough into ten areas by the name of [[township (England)|townships]], with a Township Manager and a Township Forum each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Townships|url=http://kinnear.wiganmbc.gov.uk/services/Entry.asp?EntryID=812|publisher=Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref>

===Parishes===
The borough has three civil parishes: Haigh, Shevington and Worthington. The rest of the borough is an [[unparished area]]. [[Ecclesiastical parish]]es in the west of the borough are part of the [[Anglican]] [[Anglican Diocese of Liverpool|Diocese of Liverpool]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool]], Anglican parishes in the east of the Metropolitan Borough are part of the [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester|Diocese of Manchester]] and the northern section part of the [[Diocese of Blackburn]].

===Parliamentary===
The Wigan Metropolitan Borough is currently covered by four parliamentary constituencies, [[Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)|Wigan]], [[Makerfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Makerfield]], [[Leigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Leigh]], and [[Bolton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bolton West]].(Atherton is the only Wigan ward included in Bolton West, with the rest of the constituency made up of wards from Bolton Borough). New constituency boundaries recommended by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] for the [[2010 UK election]] saw the link to Salford broken by the removal of Wigan areas from the [[Worsley (UK Parliament constituency)|Worsley]] constituency. This resulted in the Worsley constituency wards of Tyldesley and Astley-Mosley Common being placed in the [[Leigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Leigh Constituency]] with the Atherton ward becoming part of Bolton West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/index.html?boundaries2006.html|title=Greater Manchester: New Constituency Boundaries |publisher=Martin Baxter |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> Makerfield is the only constituency to have returned Labour MPs continuously since 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/news/safeseats.htm|title=Safe Seats analysis|publisher=Electoral Reform Society|date=2005-04-28 |accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>
