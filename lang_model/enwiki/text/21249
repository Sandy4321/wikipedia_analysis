'''Lai Chee Ying''' ([[Traditional Chinese character|Chinese]]: <U+9ECE><U+667A><U+82F1>; [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] {{IPA2|l<U+0250><U+026A><sub>11</sub> ts<U+026A><sub>33</sub> j<U+026A><U+014B><sub>55</sub>}}, [[Jyutping]]: lai4 zi3 jing1; [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] [[Pinyin]]: L<U+01D0> Zh<U+00EC>y<U+012B>ng, [[English language|English]] name '''Jimmy Lai''' is a serial entrepreneur ranked 962 on the forbes billionaires list he is worth 1.2 billion dollars.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Lai founded [[Giordano (clothing)|Giordano]], one of Asia's largest clothing retailers and [[Next Media]], the largest listed media company in Hong Kong and one of the world's biggest Chinese-language media groups.

==Early life and escape from mainland China==
Born 1948 in an impoverished [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], with family roots in nearby [[Shunde]], Lai was educated to fifth grade level.

Smuggled to Hong Kong aboard a small boat at the age of 12, Lai worked as a child-laborer in a garment factory for a wage of $8 per month.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2001/0122/jimmy.lai.html TIMEasia.com | Taipei's Next | 1/22/2001<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Founding of Giordano==
Rising to the level of factory manager, Lai speculated his year-end bonus on Hong Kong stocks to raise enough cash to buy out the owners of a bankrupt garment factory, Comitex, in 1975 and began producing sweaters. Customers included J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, and other U.S. retailers.<ref>[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/91/Next-Media-Ltd.html Next Media Ltd. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Next Media Ltd<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Bringing innovations to Hong Kong such as rewarding sellers with financial incentives, he built the chain into an Asia-wide retailer. One of the most well-known clothing retailers in the Asia, Giordano claims more than 11,000 employees in 1,700 shops across 30 territories worldwide.

==Transition to publishing==
Lai has been an unrelenting advocate of democracy and high-profile critic of the [[People's Republic of China]] government. Moved by the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], Lai distributed Giordano T-shirts with portraits of student leaders and began publishing ''[[Next Magazine]]'', which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting. Despite Hong Kong's crowded and highly competitive market for publications, the magazine found almost instant success. He went on to found other magazines, including ''[[Sudden Weekly]]''(<U+5FFD><U+7136><U+4E00><U+9031>), ''[[Eat & Travel Weekly]]''(<U+98F2><U+98DF><U+7537><U+5973>), ''[[Trading Express/Auto Express]]'' (<U+4EA4><U+6613><U+901A>/<U+6435><U+8ECA><U+5FEB><U+7DDA>) and the youth-oriented ''[[Easy Finder]]'' (<U+58F9><U+672C><U+4FBF><U+5229>).

In 1995, as the Hong Kong handover approached, Lai founded Apple Daily, a newspaper start-up that he was forced to finance with $100 million of his own money due to investor fear of association with a prominent critic of the Beijing government. With a circulation rising quickly to 400,000 copies by 1997, the newspaper had the territory's second largest circulation, despite fierce competition against 60 other newspapers.

''Sudden Weekly'' and  ''Next Magazine'' rank first and second in circulation for Hong Kong<U+2019>s magazine market while ''Apple Daily'' is the No. 2 newspaper in Hong Kong<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2006/10/19/lai-taiwan-newspaper-face-cx_vk_1018autofacescan06.html Lai Chases Taipei Commuters - Forbes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

Lai encourages a company culture of transparency and creativity without hierarchy. Employees are encouraged to tackle challenges through trial and error while assuming responsibility for their actions and sharing in profits from successful ventures.<ref>http://www.nextmedia.com/v5/intro.html/</ref>

In a 1994 newspaper column, he told [[Premier of the PRC]] [[Li Peng]] to "drop dead," and called the [[Communist Party of China]], "a monopoly that charges a premium for lousy service".  As a result, most of his publications remain banned in mainland China. China's government retaliated against Lai by starting a shut-down of Giordano shops, prompting him to sell out of the company he founded in order to save it.

Ahead of the record-breaking pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong of July 2003 that brought half a million people onto the streets, the cover of Next Magazine featured a photo-montage of the territory's embattled chief executive, [[Tung Chee-Hwa]] taking a pie in the face. The magazine urged readers to take to the streets while Apple Daily distributed stickers calling for Tung to resign.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_30/b3843131_mz033.htm BW Online | 28 July 2003 | A Thorn in China's Side<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In addition to promoting democracy, Lai's publication often ruffle feathers of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government. Lai has frequently faced hostility from the many Beijing-backed tycoons, including attempts to force supplier boycotts of his companies and a lengthy battle to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that he sidestepped through a [[backdoor listing]]. Lai managed to list the company in 1999 by acquiring Paramount Publishing Group in October of that year.

Neither Bank of China nor any state-owned enterprise from mainland places ads in Next Media publications, while major Hong Kong property developers and a range of other top-line companies advertise only in competing publications. The offices of his publications have been vandalized and his house was firebombed in 1993. The against Lai increased his publicity, if not popularity.

Lai pioneered a reader-centric philosophy with [[paparazzi]] journalism in Hong Kong based on publications such as ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]''.  His best-selling ''Next Magazine'' and ''[[Apple Daily]]'' newspaper, feature a mix of racy tabloid material and news items oriented to the mass market with plenty of colour and graphics that attracts a wide range of readers, some of whom are also critics of Lai and his ideology.{{Who|date=April 2009}}

==Taiwan Publications==
Lai launched [[Taiwan]] editions of ''Next Magazine'' in 2001 and ''Apple Daily'' in 2003, taking on heavily established rivals who made considerable effort to thwart him. Rival publishers pressed advertisers to boycott and distributors not to undertake home delivery. His Taiwan offices were vandalized on numerous occasions<ref>[http://www.cpj.org/attacks02/asia02/taiwan.html Attacks on the Press - 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, but as the publications grew to have the largest readership in their category<ref name="autogenerated1" />, the advertising boycotts ended.

In October 2006, Lai launched ''[[Sharp Daily]]'' (Shuang Bao in mandarin), a free daily newspaper targeting Taipei commuters. The company also launched ''[[Me! Magazine]]'' in Taiwan.

In building Taiwan's most popular newspaper, Apple Daily, and magazine, Next Magazine, Lai's racy publications have had a great impact on the island's hitherto staid media culture.

==Other Companies==
During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, Lai started the Internet-based grocery retailer which offered home delivery service, adMart.  It expanded its product scope beyond groceries to include electronics and office supplies, but was shut down after losing between $100 and $150 million. Lai attributed this business failure to overconfidence and the lack of a viable business strategy.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Admart.Asia (www.Admart.Asia), a popular free classifieds website covering Asia, is now no longer associated with Lai.

==Quotes==
"If you have fewer friends, you have more readers.<ref>[http://www.zonaeuropa.com/200702.brief.htm EastSouthWestNorth: Daily Brief Comments February 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
Among Lai's heroes are [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[John James Cowperthwaite]] and [[Milton Friedman]], bronze busts of each stand in the entrance hall to Next Media.
