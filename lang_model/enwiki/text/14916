'''Black Moshannon State Park''' is a {{convert|3481|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Rush Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania|Rush Township]] in [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. It surrounds Black Moshannon Lake, formed by a [[dam]] on [[Black Moshannon Creek]], which has given its name to the lake and park. The park is just west of the [[Allegheny Front]], {{convert|9|mi}} east of [[Philipsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania|Philipsburg]] on [[Pennsylvania Route 504]], and is largely surrounded by [[Moshannon State Forest]]. A [[bog]] in the park provides a habitat for diverse wildlife not common in other areas of the state, such as [[carnivorous plant]]s, orchids, and species normally found farther north. As home to the "[l]argest reconstituted bog/wetland complex in Pennsylvania",<ref name = "must see">{{Cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/twenty/20parks.aspx | title = Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks | accessdate = 2007-08-08| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}} ''Note: Despite the title, there are twenty-one parks in the list, with [[Colton Point State Park|Colton Point]] and [[Leonard Harrison State Park]]s treated as one.''</ref> the park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks" list.

Humans have long used the Black Moshannon area for recreational, industrial, and subsistence purposes. The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] tribe used it as hunting and fishing grounds.  European settlers cleared some land for farming, then [[clear-cutting|clear-cut]] the vast stands of [[old growth forest|old-growth]] White Pine and Eastern Hemlock to meet the needs of a growing nation during the late 19th century. Black Moshannon State Park rose from the ashes of a depleted forest that was largely destroyed by [[wildfire]] in the years following the lumber era. The forests were rehabilitated by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Many of the buildings built by the Civilian Conservation Corps stand in the park today and are protected on the list of [[National Register of Historic Places]] in three [[Historic district (United States)|historic districts]].

Black Moshannon State Park is open year-round for recreation and has an extensive network of trails which allow [[hiking]], [[bicycling|biking]], and viewing the bog habitat at the Black Moshannon State Natural Area. The park is in Pennsylvania [[Important Bird Area]] #33, where [[bird watching|bird watchers]] have recorded 175&nbsp;different species. It is also home to many rare and unusual plants and animals, due to its location atop the [[Allegheny Plateau]]; the lake is at an elevation of about {{convert|1900|ft}}. Much of the park is open for [[hunting]] and the lake and creek are open for [[fishing]], [[boating]], and [[human swimming|swimming]]. In winter it is a popular destination for [[cross-country skiing]], and was home to a small downhill [[skiing]] area from 1967&nbsp;to 1982. [[Picnic]]s and [[camping]] are also popular, and the "Friends of Black Moshannon State Park" group promotes the park and all of the recreational activities associated with it.

===Lumber era===
[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Beach House 3.jpg|thumb|right|The CCC-built beachhouse on the shores of Black Moshannon Lake near the bridge, where Antes Tavern and village were once located.]]
Prior to the arrival of [[William Penn]] and his [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Province of Pennsylvania|colonists]] in 1682, it has been estimated that up to 90&nbsp;percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: over {{convert|31000|sqmi}} of [[Eastern White Pine|White Pine]], [[Tsuga canadensis|Eastern Hemlock]], and a mix of [[hardwood]]s.<ref name="timber">{{Cite web|url = http://www.lumbermuseum.org/history.html |title = The Pennsylvania Lumber Museum - History |accessdate = 2008-04-20 |publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}</ref> The forests near the three original counties, [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], and [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], were the first to be harvested, as the early settlers used the readily available timber to build homes, barns, and ships, and cleared the land for agriculture. The demand for lumber slowly increased and by the time of the [[American Revolution]] the lumber industry had reached the interior and mountainous regions of Pennsylvania.<ref name="timber"/><ref name="taber"/>

Lumber became one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania.<ref name="timber"/> Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, [[tannin]] for the many [[Tanning|tanneries]] that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and [[barrel]] making. Large areas of forest were harvested by [[Charcoal maker|colliers]] to fire [[bloomery|iron furnaces]]. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first [[Conestoga wagon]]s.<ref name="timber"/> The Philadelphia&ndash;Erie Pike (present day [[Pennsylvania Route 504]]) opened the Black Moshannon area to [[settler]]s by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes [[Tavern]] along the Pike, trapped fur-bearing animals, and cleared land for farming.<ref name="bmsphistory"/>

By the mid-19th century, the demand for lumber reached the area, where Eastern White Pine and Eastern Hemlock covered the surrounding mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees and sent them down [[Black Moshannon Creek|Black Moshannon]] and Moshannon Creeks to the West Branch Susquehanna River, then along that to the [[Susquehanna Boom]] and [[sawmill]]s at [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]].<ref name="bmsphistory"/><ref name="taber">{{Cite book|last=Taber III |first= Thomas T. |title= Williamsport Lumber Capital |year= 1995 |edition= 1st |publisher= Paulhamus Litho, Inc. |location= [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania]] |chapter= Chapter Two: The Boom <U+2014> Making It All Possible |page= 88 | oclc = 35920715 }} <br>''Note: For a general overview of lumber history in the West Branch Susquehanna watershed, see'' {{Cite book

[[Image:Black Moshannon State Park Antes School.JPG|thumb|The Moshannon School served Antes in the late 1800s and closed in 1926. It is the only building from the lumber era left in the park.]]
The Beaver Mill Lumber Company became one of the largest single lumber operations in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber [[boomtown]]s, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area.<ref name="ABCs"/> A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam,<ref name="dayuse"/> and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured [[general store]]s, [[blacksmith]] shops, [[livery stable|liveries]], taverns, schools, and even a [[ten-pin bowling]] alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and [[railroad]]s.<ref name="bmsphistory"/>

A number of trails in the park today recall this time. The {{convert|0.8|mi|adj=on}} Seneca Trail for cross-country skiing and hiking passes through a [[Secondary forest|second growth forest]] of oak and cherry trees that shade the stumps of the [[old-growth forest|old growth pines]] harvested during the lumber era.<ref name="sierraclub"/><ref name="bmsptrails"/> The Shingle Mill Trail is a {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} loop that begins at the main parking area near the dam on Black Moshannon Lake and follows the banks of Black Moshannon Creek to the Allegheny Front Trail and back.<ref name = "hike pa"/><ref name="bmsptrails"/> The remains of Star Mill, a sawmill built in 1879&nbsp;that operated until the end of the lumber era, are on the {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} Star Mill Trail. This loop trail for hiking and cross-country skiing is flat, with a view of Black Moshannon Lake.<ref name="bmsptrails"/>

This boom era was not to last; before long the lumber was gone, and once the trees were all clear-cut, the loggers left the area. The lumbermen left behind a barren landscape that was devastated by erosion and wildfires. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] bought thousands of acres of deforested and burned land, then began the project of reforestation. By the 1930s, the land that became Black Moshannon State Park was already a place for picnics and camping, on the aptly named "Tent Hill", and people swam and fished in the old mill pond.<ref name="bmsphistory"/> The {{convert|0.5|mi|m|adj=on}} Tent Hill Trail still runs from the campsites to the beach on Black Moshannon Lake.<ref name = "hike pa"/><ref name="bmsptrails"/>

[[Image:CCC Company 359 Dam crop.PNG|thumb|right|Men of CCC Company 359&nbsp;working on the dam in Black Moshannon State Park, ''circa'' 1936]]
The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) was a work relief program for young men from unemployed families, established in 1933. As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

The original facilities at Black Moshannon State Park were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933&nbsp;to 1937.

==Ecology==
Within Black Moshannon State Park there is a State Park Natural Area protecting the bogs.<ref name="bmspwildlife"/> The park itself is part of a much larger [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA), which includes most of the surrounding state forest, airport, and private properties.<ref name="IBA33"/>

===Bog Natural Area===
[[File:Black Moshannon Bog June panorama 2.jpg|thumb|Stumps from the lumber era and lily pads in the bog natural area at Black Moshannon State Park]]
The bogs at the park contain large amounts of [[Sphagnum|sphagnum moss]]; this decomposes very slowly, causing layers of dead moss to build up at the bottom of the bog, creating [[peat]].<ref name="bmspwildlife">{{Cite web

Most bogs exist in glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park is on the Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by [[glacier]]s during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. The bogs formed here because of the beds of sandstone that lie flat, a short distance below the surface of the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here.<ref name="bmspwildlife"/> The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include [[Greater Yellowlegs|Greater]] and [[Lesser Yellowlegs]], [[Least Sandpiper]], [[Solitary Sandpiper]], and the [[Spotted Sandpiper]], which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.<ref name="IBA33"/>

The water in the bog is low in nutrients and high in acidity, which makes it difficult for most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of [[orchid]]. Wild [[cranberry|cranberries]] and [[blueberry|blueberries]] grow in the bog along with [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, [[Chamaedaphne|Leatherleaf]] shrubs, [[Eriophorum callitrix|Arctic Cotton Grass]], and [[viburnum]]s. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.<ref name="bmspwildlife"/>

The lake is home to [[American Beaver]]s, as well as [[Great Blue Heron]], [[swan]]s, [[Snow Goose|Snow Geese]], [[Common Loon]]s, and many other types of [[waterfowl]], with [[Canada Goose]], [[Ring-necked Duck]], [[Mallard]], and [[Wood Duck]] the most commonly seen. The bogs, marshes, and swamps contain [[frog]]s and [[salamander]]s, and provide a habitat for [[carnivorous plants]] like the [[pitcher plant]] and [[sundew]]. Black Moshannon State Park is home to many common species of [[songbird]]s, including [[Ovenbird]]s.<ref name = "IBA33"/><ref name="bmspwildlife"/><ref name="audubon"/>

The [[Pinophyta|conifer]] and mixed-forests of the park and its surroundings provide habitats for [[Northern Saw-whet Owl]], [[Blue-headed Vireo]], [[Hermit Thrush]], [[Dark-eyed Junco]], and [[Magnolia Warbler|Magnolia]], [[Pine Warbler|Pine]], [[Yellow-rumped Warbler|Yellow-rumped]], [[Blackburnian Warbler|Blackburnian]], and [[Black-throated Green Warbler]]s. The [[deciduous]] forests provide habitats for songbirds, such as [[Scarlet Tanager]] and [[Red-eyed Vireo]].<ref name="IBA33"/>

An outbreak of the non-native [[gypsy moth]] in the mid-1980s nearly devastated the woods in a small valley. Selective timber cuts harvested the trees that were affected by species of moth. Today the {{convert|1.6|mi|adj=on}} Sleepy Hollow Trail for hiking and cross-country skiing loops through the new growth in the area, which provides an ideal habitat for populations of White-tailed Deer and Wild Turkey.<ref name="sierraclub"/><ref name="bmsptrails"/>

====Important Bird Area====
Pennsylvania Important Bird Area #33&nbsp;encompasses {{convert|45667|acre}}. The land includes parts of the state park and surrounding Moshannon State Forest, as well as [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] No. 33, Mid-State Regional Airport (which borders both the park and forest), and some other nearby parcels of private land. The Pennsylvania [[Audubon Society]] has designated {{convert|3374|acre}} of Black Moshannon State Park as an IBA, which is an area designated as a globally important [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for the conservation of bird populations.<ref name="IBA33">{{Cite web| url = http://pa.audubon.org/IBA_Consplans/IBA33.pdf |format=PDF| title = Pennsylvania Important Bird Area #33 | author= Michelle Cohen and Stephen Goin | month = May | year = 2004|  accessdate = 2008-03-13 | publisher = Pennsylvania Audubon Society}}</ref>

[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Geese.jpg|thumb|right|A family of Canada Geese on Black Moshannon Lake, which provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.]]
[[Ornithologist]]s and bird watchers have recorded a total of 175&nbsp;species at the IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the IBA, as well as great habitat diversity. The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.<ref name="IBA33"/>

Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are especially important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and [[wader|shorebirds]]. Waterfowl observed at the park include [[Pied-billed Grebe|Pied-billed]] and [[Slavonian Grebe]]s, Common Loon, [[American Black Duck]], [[Ruddy Duck]], [[Blue-winged Teal|Blue-winged]] and [[Green-winged Teal]], [[Tundra Swan]], [[Long-tailed Duck]], [[Hooded Merganser|Hooded]] and [[Red-breasted Merganser]], [[Greater Scaup|Greater]] and [[Lesser Scaup]], [[Northern Pintail]], [[Bufflehead]], [[American Wigeon]], and [[Northern Shoveler]].<ref name="IBA33"/>

Pennsylvania IBA #33&nbsp;is on the Allegheny Front, which is along a prime migratory path for a variety of [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]. The [[Golden Eagle]], [[Bald Eagle]], [[Osprey]], and [[Hen Harrier|Northern Harrier]] pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the Bald Eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do [[nest]] in the forests of the IBA include the [[Northern Goshawk]], [[Red-shouldered Hawk|Red-shouldered]], [[Broad-winged Hawk|Broad-winged]], [[Red-tailed Hawk|Red-tailed]], [[Sharp-shinned Hawk|Sharp-shinned]], and [[Cooper's Hawk]]s.<ref name="IBA33"/>

The cool, damp habitat provided by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds that are at the southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The [[Canada Warbler]] and [[Northern Waterthrush]] nest in the bogs, as do the [[Alder Flycatcher]], [[Common Yellowthroat]], [[Swamp Sparrow]], [[Red-winged Blackbird]], and [[Gray Catbird]]. The [[Olive-sided Flycatcher]], which is designated as [[Local extinction|locally extinct]] in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting [[Barred Owl]]s in the IBA, as well as [[Virginia Rail]] and [[Sora (crake)|Sora]].<ref name="IBA33"/>

Cold water fishing is available in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find [[rainbow trout|Rainbow]] and [[Brown Trout]] that have been [[fish stocking|stocked]] there for sport fishing by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer than those of the creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including [[Largemouth Bass]], [[Muskellunge]], [[Yellow Perch]], [[Chain Pickerel]], [[Bullhead catfish|Bullhead Catfish]], [[Northern Pike]], [[Bluegill]], and [[crappie]].<ref name="bmsp"/>

Hunting is permitted in most of Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the [[understory]].<ref name="gamecommission"/> The most common game species are Ruffed Grouse, Eastern Gray Squirrel, Wild Turkey, and White-tailed Deer.
