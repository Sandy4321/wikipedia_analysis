[[File:Clydebank Titan Crane - geograph.org.uk - 1069892.jpg|thumb|right|The refurbished Titan Crane at Clydebank, situated adjacent to the fitting-out basin of the former John Brown & Company shipyard.]]

'''Titan Clydebank''' is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[Hammerhead crane|cantilever crane]] at [[Clydebank]], Scotland. It was designed to be used in the lifting of heavy equipment, such as engines and boilers, during the fitting-out of battleships and ocean liners at the [[John Brown & Company]] shipyard. It was also the world's first electrically powered cantilever crane, and the largest crane of its type at the time of its completion.

Situated at the end of a U-shaped fitting out basin, the crane was used to construct some of the largest ships of the 20th century, including the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', ''[[RMS Queen Elizabeth|Queen Elizabeth]]'' and ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. The [[Category A listed|Category A]] [[Listed building|Listed historical structure]] was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum.

==History==
The [[shipyard]] at Clydebank was created in 1871 after the company [[James & George Thomson]] moved from the Graving Docks<U+00A0>in [[Govan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clydewaterfrontheritage.com/johnbrownsshipyard.aspx |title=John Brown's Shipyard |publisher=Clyde Waterfront |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/J._and_G._Thomson |title=J. and G.

When tested on 24 April 1907, Titan was the largest cantilever crane ever built with a capacity of {{convert|160|t}} at a radius of {{convert|85|ft}}.<ref name=asce>{{cite web |url=http://www.asce.org/People-and-Projects/Projects/Landmarks/Titan-Crane/ |title=John Brown's Shipyard, Clydebank, Scotland |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> The original lift capacity was uprated to {{convert|200|t}} in 1938, when it became apparent that the original specification would be insufficient to lift new long range gun barrels onto ships such as the ''[[HMS Duke of York (17)|Duke of York]]''.<ref name=asce/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaes.org/news/enewsletter_fall2013_ms.htm |title=Scotland's Titan Crane dedicated by ASCE, ASME as a landmark |publisher=American Association of Engineering Societies |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=et/>

On the nights of the 13 and 14 of March 1941, the [[Clydebank Blitz]] virtually destroyed the town. 528 civilians were killed, over 617 people were seriously injured, and 48,000 civilians lost their homes.<ref name=es>{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/20thand21stcenturies/worldwarii/clydebankblitz/index.asp |title=Clydebank Blitz |publisher=Education Scotland |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged, in one of the worst bombing raids in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zhzlw |title=The Clydebank Blitz |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> The raids, involving 260 [[Luftwaffe]] bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of [[Greater Glasgow|Clydeside]], but the Titan crane was undamaged.<ref name=es/><ref name=top>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18720832 |title=Top engineering award for Clydebank's Titan Crane |date=5 July 2012 |work=BBC News |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref>

In 1968, the yard was amalgamated into [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders]] along with four others, in an attempt to increase competitiveness.<ref name=rad>{{cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/courad/courad21.htm |title=Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in 1971/72 |publisher=University of Strathclyde |accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|general elections in 1970]] saw a change of government, and funding for the yard was withheld, resulting in the closure of John Brown's.<ref name=rad/><ref name="history" /> It was bought from the receivers by the Marathon Manufacturing Company for oil rig construction.<ref name="history" />  In 1980 Marathon sold the yard to the French company Union Industrielle et d<U+2019>Entreprise (UiE).

===Refurbishment===

The crane fell into disuse in 1980s, and in the intervening period of neglect, the crane suffered vandalism to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure.<ref name=mns/> In 1988 the crane was recognised as a [[Category A listed|Category A]] [[Listed building|Listed historical structure]].<ref name="history" />

The urban regeneration company Clydebank Re-Built started a <U+00A3>3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane opened to the public in August 2007.<ref name=mns>{{cite web |url=http://www.macleanandspeirs.com/media/The%20Titan%20Story.pdf |title=Titan Crane, Clydebank |publisher=MacLean and Speirs |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref> The structure was [[shot-blasted]] to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting.<ref name=mns/> A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.<ref name=mns/>

==Design==
[[File:Viewing platform of the Clydebank Titan Crane - geograph.org.uk - 1330551.jpg|thumb|right|The Titan Crane's jib has been converted into a public viewing platform.]]
The Titan used a fixed counterweight and electrically operated hoists all mounted on a rotated beam, making it faster and more responsive than its steam powered predecessors.<ref name=ice>{{cite news |url=http://www.ice.org.uk/News-Public-Affairs/ICE-News/Scotlands-Titan-gains-Eiffel-Tower-status-%281%29 |title=Scotland<U+2019>s Titan gains Eiffel Tower status |date=22 August 2013 |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> For lifting smaller assemblies that did not require the full lifting capacity of {{convert|150|t}}, a {{convert|30|t}} auxiliary hoist was used, as large loads were comparatively rare.<ref name=ff/>

Titan is {{convert|49|m}} high, weighs about {{convert|800|t}} and sits on four concrete piles sunk to a depth of {{convert|23|m}} deep.<ref name=et/><ref name=ff>{{cite web |url=http://www.titanclydebank.com/about-the-crane/facts.aspx |title=Facts |publisher=Clydebank Rebuilt |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> The arms of the cantilever are {{convert|45.7|m}} and {{convert|27.4|m}} long.<ref name=et/><ref name=ff/> The tower is {{convert|12|m}} square, and its centre sits just {{convert|10.7|m}} from the edge of the quay.<ref name=et/>

Following the removal of the Titan crane at [[Govan Shipbuilders|Govan Shipyard]] in 2007, there are now four giant cantilever cranes on the [[River Clyde]].<ref name=cwf>{{cite web |url=http://www.clydewaterfrontheritage.com/titancrane_2.aspx |title=Titan Crane |publisher=Clyde Waterfront |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=us>{{cite web |url=http://gbarr.info/2011/06/01/and-the-there-were-four-titan-cranes-of-the-clyde/ |title=And then there were four: Titan Cranes of the Clyde |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=gbarr.info |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref> The others are at Stobcross ([[Finnieston Crane]]), [[Scotstoun]] ([[Barclay Curle Crane]]) and [[Greenock]] (James Watt Dock).<ref name=us/> Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide, six of them on the Clyde, and as of May 2011, it is believed only eleven remained, four of those on the Clyde.<ref name=et>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1219 |title=Titan Crane, Clydebank |publisher=engineering-timelines.com |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref>

==Awards==
The crane was awarded the 2012 [[Engineering Heritage Award]] by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], and described as "a magnificent example of mechanical engineering, which forms an integral part of the local landscape".<ref name=top/><ref name=aw/> Titan was designated as an International Historic Civil and Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] in 2013, the fifth such award given to a Scottish structure.<ref name=aw>{{cite news |url=http://www.titanclydebank.com/news/scotland%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98titan%E2%80%99-gains-eiffel-tower-status.aspx |title=Scotlands Titan gains Eiffel Tower status |date=20 August 2013 |publisher=Clydebank Re-built |accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref>

For the restoration of the structure, recognition was accorded by [[International Architecture Awards|Chicago Athenaeum Award]] for Architecture in 2008 and by the Civic Trust in 2009.<ref name=aw/>
