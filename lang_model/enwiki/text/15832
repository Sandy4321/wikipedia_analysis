==Recent acceleration==
[[Image:Pigshelf.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Floating [[ice shelf]] at the downstream end of Pine Island Glacier. The crack shows the start of a large [[iceberg]] calving]]
Some scientists have proposed that this region around Pine Island Bay may be a "weak underbelly" of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The Pine Island and [[Thwaites Glacier|Thwaites]] Glaciers are two of Antarctica's five largest [[ice stream]]s. Scientists have found that the flow of these ice streams has accelerated in recent years, and suggested that if they were to melt, global sea levels would rise by 1<U+2013>2 yards (0.9<U+2013>1.9 m), destabilizing the entire West Antarctic ice sheet and perhaps sections of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].<ref>''With Speed and Violence: Why scientists fear tipping points in climate change'', Fred Pearce, Beacon Press Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-8070-8576-9</ref>

The speed of Pine Island Glacier increased by 73% from 1974 to the end of 2007, with an 8% increase over the last 16&nbsp;months alone. This speed up has meant that at the end of 2007 the Pine Island Glacier system had a negative mass balance of 46&nbsp;[[gigatonne]]s per year. In other words, much more water was being put into the sea by the ice stream than was being replaced by snowfall.<ref name=rignot2008/>

It has been suggested that this recent acceleration could have been triggered by warm ocean waters at the end of the ice stream, where it has a floating section ([[ice shelf]]) approximately 50&nbsp;km long.<ref name=shepherd2001/><ref name=payne2004/><ref name=thoma2008>{{cite journal |author=Thoma M., Jenkins A., Holland D., Jacobs S. |title=Modelling Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf, Antarctica |journal=[[Geophys. Res. Lett.]] |volume=35 |pages=L18602 |year=2008 |doi=10.1029/2008GL034939}}</ref>

==Subglacial volcano==

In January, 2008, the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal [[Nature Geoscience]]) that 2,200&nbsp;years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under the [[Antarctic]] ice sheet (based on [[airborne]] survey with radar images). The biggest Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000&nbsp;years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the [[Hudson Mountains]], close to Pine Island Glacier.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194579.stm  BBC NEWS, Ancient Antarctic eruption noted]</ref><ref name=corr2008>{{cite journal |author=Corr H.F.J., Vaughan D.G. |title=A recent volcanic eruption beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=1 |pages=122<U+2013>125 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo106}}</ref>

==History of fieldwork==
[[Image:Iceseismic.jpg|thumb|right|Seismic surveying on Pine Island Glacier]]
The first expedition to visit the ice stream was a US oversnow traverse, where they spent around a week in the area of PIG during January 1961. They dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness. One of the scientists on this traverse was [[Charles Bentley|Charlie Bentley]],<ref name=bentley>{{cite web | title = Practically Home | publisher = The Antarctic Sun | url = http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=1370 | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref> who claims "we didn't know we were crossing a glacier at the time." This is not surprising, because PIG is around 50 km wide at the point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from the surrounding ice. This expedition, was called the 'Ellsworth Highland Traverse.'<ref name=behrendt2005>{{cite book |last=Behrendt |first=John |year=2005 |title=The Ninth Circle: A memoir of life and death in Antarctica, 1960 - 1962 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0826334253}}</ref><ref name=scott>{{cite web | title = History of Fieldwork on PIG | url = http://www.docjules.com/pig/index.html | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref>

The [[British Antarctic Survey]] arrived at the ice stream on 8 December 2006 for the first of two field seaons. In the second field season they spent three months there from November 2007 to February 2008. Work on the glacier included [[Ground-penetrating radar|radar]] measurements and [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]].<ref name=measuring/>

In January 2008 [[Robert Bindschadler|Bob Bindschadler]] ([[NASA]]) landed on the floating [[ice shelf]] of PIG, this is at the downstream end where it floats on the sea. It was decided that the area was too hard for further landings and fieldwork. Therefore two GPS units and a weather station were positioned as near as possible to PIG.<ref name=discovery>{{cite web | title = Discovery Earth Live | publisher = Discovery Channel | url = http://blogs.discovery.com/discovery_earth_live/ | accessdate = 2009-01-30}}</ref>
