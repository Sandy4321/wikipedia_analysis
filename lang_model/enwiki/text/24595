'''F<U+00E9>lix Sav<U+00F3>n Fabre''' (born September 22, 1967) is a [[Cuba]]n heavyweight [[boxing|boxer]], a winner of three gold medals at the [[Olympic Games]]. Sav<U+00F3>n is 6&nbsp;ft 5 in (196&nbsp;cm)<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/news/2000/03/30/savon_bio/ Olympic Bio: Felix Sav<U+00F3>n  - Sport Illustrated]</ref> tall.

==Early life and career==

Born in [[San Vicente, Cuba|San Vicente]], in the [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Province]], Sav<U+00F3>n began his boxing career in 1980. During his career, in which he did not turn professional, he managed a career record of 362-21.

He won his first important titles in 1985. Besides winning the Cuban heavyweight title (which he would win each year until his retirement, except 1999 and 2000 when he lost to [[Odlanier Solis]]), he also won the Junior World Championships in 1985.

This set off his career, in which he would win 6 World Championships; his victory at the 1997 tournament was the result of the disqualification of an opponent, future professional world champion [[Ruslan Chagaev]], who beat Sav<U+00F3>n in the final, but was later stripped of the gold medal for having two professional fights prior to the championships. Chagaev was reinstated as an amateur the following year when these fights were declared exhibitions, but did not regain the gold medal.

At the 1999 tournament, he was to fight American [[Michael Bennett (boxer)|Michael Bennett]] in the final, but the whole Cuban team retired from the competition to protest the results of other Cuban boxers in the tournament whom they considered to be "robbed" by the judges, meaning that Bennett won the final on default.

Sav<U+00F3>n also won three Olympic gold medals, which feat is shared with only two other boxers, [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Papp]] and compatriot [[Te<U+00F3>filo Stevenson]].

After winning his third Olympic gold at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], Sav<U+00F3>n announced his retirement at age 33.

In February of the following year with [[Fidel Castro]] also present, Sav<U+00F3>n had the song "[[You Love Us]]" dedicated to him by the [[Manic Street Preachers]], who became the first [[Western world|western]] [[Rock and roll|rock]] band to play in Cuba.
