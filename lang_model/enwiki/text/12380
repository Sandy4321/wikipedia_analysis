'''Keith Blakelock''', a London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] constable, was killed on the evening of Sunday, 6 October 1985, during [[Broadwater Farm riot|rioting on the Broadwater Farm]] housing estate in [[Tottenham]], north London. The violence broke out after a local black woman died of heart failure during a police search of her home the previous day. It took place against a backdrop of unrest in several English cities and a breakdown of relations between the police and black communities.<ref name=Brainp106>Timothy Brain, "Handsworth, Brixton, and Broadwater Farm," ''A History of Policing in England and Wales from 1974: A Turbulent Journey''.

PC Blakelock had been assigned on the night of his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and a sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of around 50 people, he received over 40 stabbing and cutting injuries inflicted by [[machete]]s or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife buried up to the hilt in his neck.<ref name=Brainp106/> He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in [[Clerkenwell]], London, in 1833.<ref>Kenneth Newman, [http://web.archive.org/web/20110721071915/http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/files/POLICE0001/speeches/1986%20Sir%20Kenneth%20Newman.pdf "Police-Public Relations: The Pace of Change"], Police Foundation lecture, July 1986, p. 1.

Detectives came under enormous pressure to find the killers, amid tabloid coverage that was sometimes openly racist.<ref>David Rose, ''Climate of Fear: The Murder of PC Blakelock and the Case of the Tottenham Three'', Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd, 1992 (hereafter Rose 1992), pp. 77<U+2013>84.</ref> Faced with a lack of forensic evidence, they resorted to mass arrests and charges based on confessions only. Of the 359 people arrested, most were interviewed without access to lawyers. Three adults and three youths were charged with murder based on untaped admissions they were said to have made to police. When the adults, [[Winston Silcott]], Engin Raghip and Mark Braithwaite, were convicted in 1987, a widely supported campaign arose to overturn the verdicts; Silcott was even briefly elected honorary president of the [[London School of Economics]].<ref name=LSE/> The convictions were quashed in 1991, after forensic tests cast doubt on the authenticity of detectives' notes from an interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself.<ref name=Rose18Jan2004>David Rose, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/jan/18/ukcrime.race "'They created Winston Silcott, the beast of Broadwater Farm.

Police re-opened the inquiry in 2003, and carried out forensic tests not available during the earlier investigation, including on a machete found buried near the estate in 2004.

Keith Henry Blakelock (28 June 1945 <U+2013> 6 October 1985) was born in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. He joined the Metropolitan Police on 14 November 1980, just five years before his death, and was assigned to a response team in [[Hornsey]] before becoming a [[Community Beat Manager|home beat officer]] in [[Muswell Hill]], north London.<ref>[http://cms.met.police.uk/met/boroughs/haringey/04how_are_we_doing/news/pc_keith_blakelock_remembered "PC Keith Blakelock Remembered"], Metropolitan Police, 8 July 2011.</ref> At the time of his death, he was married to Elizabeth Blakelock, with three sons, Mark, Kevin and Lee. Lee Blakelock, eight years old when his father died, went on to become a police officer himself, joining [[Durham Police]] in 2000. PC Blakelock is buried in [[East Finchley Cemetery]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/2951985.stm "Honour for murdered Pc's son"], BBC News, 16 April 2003.</ref>

===Broadwater Farm===

Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, in the [[London Borough of Haringey|Borough of Haringey]], north London ([[N postcode area|N17]]), emerged out of the British government's policy from the 1930s onwards of slum clearance, in which poorly maintained [[terraced house]]s were bulldozed to make way for high-rise [[Council house|social housing]].<ref>Rose 1992, p. 27.

[[File:Stapleford block, Broadwater Farm, Tottenham.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=photograph|Commentators said the outdoor walkways turned the estate into a rabbit warren.]]
British journalist David Rose writes that by 1976 the Farm was already seen as a [[sink estate]], and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 27<U+2013>30.

Commentators said the linked walkways, combined with the ground-level parking spaces and arches beloved of drug dealers, had turned the estate into a "rabbit warren" for criminals, to the point where residents said they were afraid to leave their homes.<ref name=Jones2007p72>Cecily Jones, "Broadwater Farm estate: pre-riot problems," in David Dabydeen, John Gilmore, and Cecily Jones (eds.), ''The Oxford Companion to Black British History'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 72.</ref> According to Dutch architectural historian [[Crimson Architectural Historians|Wouter Vanstiphout]]: "[T]here are elevated walkways, there are little stairs that connect them, there are these huge stairwells where the different elevated walkways come together ... there is a huge underground zone that is completely unmonitored, which consists of parking places ... so it's an incredible nest ... one of these typical modernist, multi-level network city constructions that make it extremely difficult for the police to exert any control over it, and it makes the police extremely vulnerable for attacks from behind, underneath, from the top."<ref>Wouter Vanstiphout, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyFnJYGoghU "Blame the Architect"], Delft University of Technology, lecture 3, part 1/6, from 10:30 mins, courtesy of ''YouTube'', accessed 30 July 2013.
*The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] blamed instead the local council's policy of "using the estate as a gathering ground for its problem tenants," combined with low rents that left no funds for adequate maintenance.

===Social unrest across England===

[[File:1981 Brixton Riots.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph|Police line up with shields (left) by [[Coldharbour Lane]] during the [[1981 Brixton riot]]s.]]
The riots in which Blakelock died took place within a wave of social unrest across England. Since the [[1980 St. Pauls riot]] in Bristol, and particularly since the [[1981 Brixton riot]] in south London, a series of incidents had sparked violent confrontations across the country between black youths and largely white police officers.<ref name=Brainp106/>

On 9 September 1985, a month before Blakelock's murder, [[1985 Handsworth riots|there was rioting]] in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], Birmingham, after the arrest of a black man for a traffic offence; two people were killed.<ref>Nick Cohen, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/30/race.politicalcolumnists "Politics of the ghetto"], ''The Observer'', 20 October 2005.</ref> On 28 September, a black woman, Dorothy "Cherry" Groce (1948<U+2013>2011), was accidentally shot by police while they searched her home in [[Brixton]] looking for her son, [[Michael Groce]], who was wanted on suspicion of robbery and firearms offences.<ref>Brain 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&lpg=PA113&dq=%22keith%20blakelock%22&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref> Believing she had died in the shooting <U+2013> in fact, she survived but was left paralysed from the waist down <U+2013> a group of protesters gathered outside Brixton police station, and [[1985 Brixton riot|rioting broke out]] that saw police lose control of the area for 48 hours.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8483471/Woman-whose-shooting-sparked-Brixton-riots.html "Woman whose shooting sparked Brixton riots", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 April 2011]</ref> A photojournalist, 29-year-old David Hodge, was killed when a [[breeze block]] was dropped on his head while he photographed the looting.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 53.</ref>

Rumours spread throughout London that more rioting was imminent, including in [[Bermondsey]] and the [[The Mall Wood Green|Wood Green shopping centre]] near Broadwater Farm. On 1 October there were disturbances in [[Toxteth]], Liverpool, and on the same day police stopped and searched all vehicles entering the Farm, finding a petrol bomb there the next day. As David Rose wrote in 1992, all that was needed for the rioting to begin was a trigger.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 53<U+2013>56.</ref>

===(5 October 1985) Death of Cynthia Jarrett===
{{Location map | United Kingdom Greater London

}}
On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a week after the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on suspicion of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion that turned out to be groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Dr Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs. Jarrett had a heart condition so severe she probably only had months to live.<ref>Rose 1992, p 57.</ref>

According to Rose, the police let themselves into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Mrs. Jarrett and her family were watching television. The inquest heard that an officer accidentally pushed against Mrs. Jarrett, causing her to fall, although the officer denied this. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 57; Brain 2010, p. 111.</ref>

===(6 October) Rioting breaks out===
{{further|Broadwater Farm riot}}
Protesters began to gather outside Tottenham police station, a few hundred yards from Broadwater Farm, around 1:30&nbsp;am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked the crowd to disperse. Later that day, two police officers were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 61<U+2013>62, 64.</ref> By early evening a crowd of 500 mostly young black men had gathered on the estate, throwing petrol bombs, bricks and stones, and dropping concrete blocks from the outdoor walkways that surrounded the apartment blocks.<ref name=Brainp112>Brain 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&pg=PA112 p. 112].</ref> The subsequent rioting was regarded as one of the most violent incidents the country had seen.<ref name=Jacobs2009>Brian Jacobs, ''Black Politics and Urban Crisis in Britain'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 190, 197.</ref> Apart from Blakelock's death, 250 police officers were injured, and two policemen and three journalists suffered gunshot wounds.<ref name=Parry7Oct1985>Gareth Parry, John Ezard, and Andrew Rawnsley, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1985/oct/07/ukcrime.garethparry "Policeman killed in riot"], ''The Guardian'', 7 October 1985.</ref> It was the first time shots had been fired by rioters in Britain, and the first time the police in England had deployed plastic bullets, although in the end they were not used.<ref>

===Serial 502===
[[File:Tangmere block, Broadwater Farm, Tottenham.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=photograph|Tangmere block, where Blakelock was sent to protect firefighters. The garden in the foreground marks the spot where he was killed.]]
Blakelock was assigned on the night to Serial 502, a Metropolitan police unit consisting of a sergeant and 10 constables from Hornsey and Wood Green police stations.<ref name=Pengelly2010>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/crimewatch/appeals/2010/10/blakelock_pengelly.shtml "Interview with Dave Pengelly"], BBC Crimewatch, 26 October 2010.</ref> A "shield serial" was a unit equipped with shields, Nato helmets and a personnel carrier; expecting trouble, the Metropolitan police had increased the deployment of these patrols across the capital.<ref>Brain 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&pg=PA111 p. 111].</ref> Serial 502 consisted of three Scots, three Londoners, including a Jamaican, and one each from Cumbria, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Sunderland and Merseyside.<ref>Ranulph Fiennes, ''My Heroes: Extraordinary Courage, Exceptional People'', Hodder & Stoughton Ltd, 2011 (hereafter Fiennes 2011), p. 48.</ref>

At 9:30&nbsp;pm Sgt David Pengelly led the unit into Broadwater Farm to protect firemen who had earlier been forced out of the estate's Tangmere block ''(pictured)'', where a fire had started in a newsagent's on the first floor.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8687035/Tottenham-riot-reminds-north-London-of-Broadwater-Farm-riot-in-1985.html "Tottenham riot reminds north London of Broadwater Farm riot in 1985"], ''The Daily Telegraph, 7 August 2011.</ref> One of the firemen, Trevor Stratford, said the men made their way up an enclosed staircase, with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared on the floor at the top of the stairs, blowing whistles and throwing bottles; it was later suspected that the setting of the fire had been an ambush.<ref name=Harris18Feb2010>Paul Harris, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251865/PC-Keith-Blakelock-murder-Will-killers-finally-face-justice.html "The murder of PC Blakelock was so savage witnesses still shake at the memory"], ''The Daily Mail'', 18 February 2010.</ref> Pengelly ordered the officers and firemen to retreat.

"I had a tiny, short truncheon. ... We were woefully under-equipped."<ref name=Craig3Oct2004/>

===Attack on Blakelock===
As they ran down the stairwell, Statford saw there were rioters at the bottom of the stairs too, wearing masks or crash helmets, and carrying knives, baseball bats, bricks and petrol bombs.<ref name=Harris18Feb2010/> As the firefighters and police ran out of the stairwell toward a car park and a patch of grass, Stratford saw that Blakelock had tripped and fallen: "He just stumbled and went down and they were upon him. It was just mob hysteria. ... There were about 50 people on him.<ref name=Brainp13>Brain 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&lpg=PA113&dq=%22keith%20blakelock%22&pg=PA113 p. 113].</ref>

The rioters removed Blakelock's protective helmet, which was never found. Rose writes that the pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in his overalls, and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His hands and arms were cut to ribbons, and he had lost several of his fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stabbing wounds on his back, six on his face, a six-inch gash across the right side of his head, and his jawbone had been smashed. Bowen said the force of the blow that caused this injury had been "almost as if to sever his head."<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 85<U+2013>86.

*Terry Lloyd, ''[[ITV News at Ten|News At Ten]]'', ITN, 8 October 1985: "Witnesses say that having wrenched his riot helmet from him, his attackers then repeatedly stabbed him in the body, and continuously hacked away at his neck. PC Blakelock lost several fingers as he tried to defend himself before the attackers fled ... Tonight Scotland Yard confirmed that the injuries were so grievous that it did appear the men were trying to behead the officer."

A second group surrounded PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut to his face, a broken upper jaw, and a smashed lower jaw. In 2004 he said he was still suffering the effects of the attack, including poor hearing and eyesight, and epileptic fits.

Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. I literally slid into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck.

Between us all we managed to manhandle Keith out to the road, and safety. He was already unconscious when I'd got to him on the ground. I started mouth-to-mouth and heart massage on him, but his injuries were just horrific.

===Media response===
{{Blakelock timeline}}
Rose writes that there was a racist media frenzy after the killing, placing intense external pressure on detectives to solve the case. According to Rose, the news coverage included the ''Sun'' newspaper comparing Labour's prospective candidate for Tottenham, [[Bernie Grant]] (1944<U+2013>2000) <U+2013> who had immigrated from Guyana in 1963 <U+2013> to an ape, writing that he had given a press conference while peeling a banana and juggling an orange. Grant had caused uproar when he was reported as saying the police had been given a "bloody good hiding," although his statement was also reported as: "The youths around here believe the police were to blame for what happened on Sunday and what they got was a bloody good hiding."<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 78<U+2013>79.

The Metropolitan Police commissioner, Kenneth Newman, told reporters that groups of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] had orchestrated the violence, a theme picked up by the ''Daily Telegraph'' and others. The ''Daily Express'' <U+2013> falling for a story from notorious hoaxer [[Rocky Ryan]] (1937<U+2013>2004) <U+2013> reported on 8 October that a "Moscow-trained hit squad gave orders as mob hacked PC Blakelock to death," alleging that "crazed left-wing extremists" trained in Moscow and Libya had coordinated the riots.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 78.

There was also internal pressure on detectives from the rank and file, who saw their superior officers as sharing the blame for Blakelock's death.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> The [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]]'s journal, ''Police'', argued that senior officers had pursued a policy at Broadwater Farm of avoiding confrontation at all costs, and that "community policing" had led to compromises with criminals, rather than maintaining a focus on upholding the law. As a result, the journal wrote, officers had failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that had developed on the estate.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref>

===Officer in charge===
Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad was placed in charge of the investigation a few hours after the killing, at 2 am on 7 October.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 75.</ref> The inquiry became the largest in the history of the Metropolitan Police, with 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]. He studied at [[Bramshill Police College]], served with the [[Flying Squad]], and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of [[Kenneth Erskine]], the Stockwell Strangler. He became a [[Detective Chief Superintendent]] in March 1985 when he joined the International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1), which Peter Victor writes takes only the cream of detectives.<ref name=Victor>Peter Victor, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/silcott-officer-will-return-in-triumph-graham-melvin-will-receive-a-heros-welcome-when-he-reenters-the-yard-tomorrow-says-peter-victor-1417283.html "Silcott officer will return in triumph"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 31 July 1994.</ref>

===Murder charges===
Det Ch Supt Melvin's first problem was that there was no forensic evidence to go on. Senior officers did not allow the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant the crime scene was not secured. Witnesses and those involved in the attack were able to leave without even giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate until 4&nbsp;am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during [[Haringey Council]]'s clean-up operation.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref>

[[File:BWFE plan (cropped).JPG|thumb|240px|alt=photograph|Map of the Broadwater Farm estate, 2007]]
Melvin therefore resorted to arresting suspects <U+2013> including juveniles, some of them regarded as vulnerable <U+2013> and holding them for days without access to lawyers.<ref name=Pallister19March1991>David Pallister, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1991/mar/19/prisons-and-probation "Relatives renew Tottenham Three case plea"], ''The Guardian'', 19 March 1991.</ref> Of the 359 people arrested in connection with the inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed in the presence of a lawyer, and many of the confessions that resulted <U+2013> whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting <U+2013> were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 110.</ref>

When people did confess to even a minor role in the rioting, such as throwing a few stones, they were charged with [[affray]], a serious offence. One resident told the 1986 Gifford inquiry into the rioting: "You would go to bed and just lie there, and you would think, are they going to come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children? It was the horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 111<U+2013>112.</ref>

Melvin defended his methods in court by arguing that lawyers might wittingly or unwittingly pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He said under cross-examination that, in his view, "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left a lot to be desired"; he said he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 174<U+2013>175.</ref> The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the murder trial that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what they had said, and that "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective."<ref>Rose 1992, p. 186.</ref>

====Juveniles====
{{anchor|Mark Pennant}}
Mark Pennant, aged 15, was arrested on 9 October, and charged with murder on 11 October, the first person to be charged in connection with the killing. He was born in England to West Indian parents, and had been raised in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK. He had learning difficulties and was attending a special school. He was arrested and handcuffed at school, and taken to Wood Green Police Station, where he was interviewed six times over the course of two days with a teacher in attendance. He said he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice. He named Winston Silcott as the ringleader, and named others he said were involved, including a juvenile, Mark Lambie.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 104<U+2013>107, 109.</ref>

{{anchor|Jason Hill}}
Jason Hill, a 13-year-old white boy who lived on Broadwater Farm, was seen looting from a store in the Tangmere block during the rioting, near where Blakelock was killed. He was arrested on 13 October and taken to Leyton Police Station, where he was held for three days without access to a lawyer. He was reportedly kept in a very hot cell, which he said made sleeping and even breathing difficult. His clothes and shoes were removed for forensic tests, and he was interviewed wearing only underpants and a blanket, the latter of which by the third day of detention was stained with his own vomit. Hyacinth Moody of the Haringey Community Relations Council sat in as an "appropriate adult"; she was later criticized by the judge for having failed to intervene.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 50, 141, 145<U+2013>146.</ref>

Over the course of several interviews, Hill told police that he had witnessed the attack, and named Silcott and others, including Mark Lambie.<ref name=Rose1992p142>Rose 1992, p. 142.</ref> He described almost a ritualistic killing, and said Silcott <U+2013> whom he called "Sticks" <U+2013> had forced him to make his own "mark" on Blakelock with a sword. He described injuries to Blakelock's body that did not match the autopsy report.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 142, 144<U+2013>145.</ref> After he had cut Blakelock, he said Silcott told him he was cool, and asked him what he had seen. Hill said he replied, "Nothing," and that Silcott said, "Well, you can go."<ref>Rose 1992, p. 145.</ref> He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick.<ref name=Rose1992p142/> In 1991 he told David Rose that, throughout the interview, the police were saying, "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," and "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks, and told him he would never see his family. He told Rose: "They could have told me it was Prince Charles and I would have said it was him."<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 151<U+2013>152.</ref>

{{anchor|Mark Lambie}}
Mark Lambie, aged 14, was the third juvenile to be charged with the murder. He was named by both Mark Pennant and Jason Hill,<ref>Rose 1992, p. 116.</ref> and was interviewed with his father and a solicitor present.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 130, 133, 136.</ref> Lambie admitted to having taken part in the rioting, but denied involvement in the murder. One witness said during the trial that he had seen Lambie force his way through the crowd to reach Blakelock, although the testimony was later discredited; the witness was caught in several lies and admitted he had offered evidence only to avoid a prison sentence.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 138<U+2013>139.</ref> Seventeen years later, in May 2002, Lambie <U+2013> identified by newspapers as a [[Yardie]] gang leader <U+2013> was jailed for 12 years for kidnap and blackmail, after detaining and torturing two men.<ref>Jason Bennetto, [http://web.archive.org/web/20090421081002/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/britains-most-feared-yardie-leader-jailed-651807.html "Britain's most feared Yardie leader jailed"], ''The Independent'', 21 May 2002.</ref>

David Rose writes that a former detective inspector called the Blakelock investigation a "pre-scientific inquiry, it was all about how to get Winston Silcott convicted, not discovering who killed Keith Blakelock."<ref>Rose 1992, p. 115.</ref> By the time of the murder, the local police saw Silcott as the "biggest mafioso in Tottenham," running gangs of muggers and paying them in drugs, according to Rose's source.<ref name=Rose89>Rose 1992, p. 89.</ref>

Silcott was 26 years old when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both [[Seventh-day Adventists]], had arrived in England from [[Montserrat]] two years earlier.<ref>Dominic Casciani, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3208724.stm "Winston Silcott: An infamous past"], BBC News, 20 October 2003.</ref> He told Rose that he had experienced racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. He left school at 15 and took a series of low-paying jobs.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 21<U+2013>24.</ref> He began breaking into houses in 1976, and the next year was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to [[borstal]] for a few months.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 26<U+2013>27.</ref> In 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding,<ref>Rose 1992, p. 91.</ref> and in September 1980 stood trial for the murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a postal worker, who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979.<ref>Jason Bennetto, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/silcott-to-be-released-18-years-after-blakelock-murder-case-583525.html "Silcott to be released 18 years after Blakelock murder case"], ''The Independent'', 16 October 2003.</ref> The first trial resulted in a hung jury; a second trial saw him acquitted.<ref name=McKillop20Mar1987/>

In 1980 Silcott and a friend began operating a mobile disco known as "Galaxy Soul Shuffle," playing at festivals and private parties.<ref>David Rose, [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/focus-in-the-face-of-prejudice-1199525.html "Focus: In the Face of Prejudice"], ''The Independent'', 20 September 1998.</ref> In 1983 he was given a government grant to open a greengrocer's on the deck of the Tangere block of Broadwater Farm. In October that year he was fined for possessing a flick knife, and in March 1984 for obstructing police.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 93<U+2013>94.</ref> In 1985 he made the news when he spoke to [[Princess Diana]] during an official visit to Broadwater Farm, reportedly telling her she should not have come without bringing jobs with her, which the ''Sun'' newspaper interpreted as a threat.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 94.</ref>

In December 1984 he was arrested for the murder of a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith was slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung was lacerated, and his [[aorta]] was cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985, and was out on bail awaiting trial when Blakelock was killed in October 1985. He at first told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, although at trial he said he had been confused and had indeed been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and he had pushed him back, but had not been carrying a knife. He was convicted of the murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 230<U+2013>233.</ref> Later, he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there was bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed him in self-defence, because he could see that one of Smith's friends had a knife.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 234<U+2013>235.</ref>

=====Disputed interview=====
Known as "Sticks" locally, Silcott was living in the Martlesham block of the Broadwater Farm estate at the time of the riots,<ref name=McKillop20Mar1987/> and was running his greengrocer's shop in the Tangmere block, the block near the spot where Blakelock was killed.<ref name=Barling27Feb2004/> He told ''The Observer'' in 2004 that he had been in the Tangmere block on the night of the death, and had stopped someone throwing a scaffolding pole through the window of his shop. Then a friend of his, Pam, had invited him to her apartment to keep him out of trouble. He told the newspaper: "And look, I'm on bail for a murder. I know I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid. There's helicopters, police photographers everywhere. All I could think about was that I didn't want to lose my bail.<ref name=Rose18Jan2004/> He said he first learned of Blakelock's death when he heard cheering in the apartment he was staying in, in response to a news report about it.<ref name=McDougall3Mar2004>Dan McDougall, [http://news.scotsman.com/uk/Winston-Silcott-calls-for-inquiry.2508354.jp "Winston Silcott calls for inquiry into PC Blakelock murder case"], ''The Scotsman'', 3 March 2004.</ref>

He was arrested for the murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot, and was interviewed five times over 24 hours, Det Ch Supt Melvin asking the questions and Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking the notes.<ref name=Bennett29June1994/> During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign them, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the interview notes. The notes show him asking: "Who told you that?"<ref name=Bennett29June1994/> When the detectives said they had witnesses, he reportedly said: "They are only kids. No one is going to believe them." The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: "You cunts, you cunts," and "Jesus, Jesus," then: "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: "You're too slow, man, they gone." He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: "They won't give evidence against me."<ref name=Rose132>Rose 1992, pp. 132<U+2013>133, 187.</ref>

}}
Nineteen-year-old Engin Raghip, of Turkish-Cypriot descent, was arrested on 24 October after a friend mentioned his name to police, the only time anyone had linked him to the murder.<ref name=Rose1992p160/> During his trial, the court heard from an expert that Raghip was "in the middle of the mildly mentally handicapped range," although this testimony was withheld from the jury.<ref>Philip W.H. Fennell, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1410270 "Mentally Disordered Suspects in the Criminal Justice System"], ''Journal of Law and Society'', 21(1), March 1994 (pp. 57<U+2013>71), p. 64.</ref> His mental impairment became a key issue during his successful appeal in 1991 in ''R v Raghip and others'', when the court accepted that it rendered his confession unsafe.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 217<U+2013>220.</ref>

Rose writes that Raghip was born in England in 1958, ten years after his parents had emigrated from Cyprus. He left school at 15, illiterate, and by the time of the murder had two convictions, one for stealing cars and one for burglary. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, with whom he had a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, though he lived nearby in [[Wood Green]], and had gone to the Farm with two friends on the day of the rioting to watch, he said. One of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the ''Daily Mirror'' on 23 October, apparently boasting about his involvement in the rioting. He was arrested, and he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.<ref name=Rose1992p160>Rose 1992, pp. 160<U+2013>161.</ref>

At the time of Raghip's arrest he had been drinking and smoking cannabis for several days, had not slept or eaten properly, and his common-law wife had just left him, taking their son with her. He was held for two days without representation, first speaking to a solicitor on the third day, who said he had found Raghip distressed and disoriented.<ref name=Gudjonssonp464>G<U+00ED>sli H. Gu<U+00F0>j<U+00F3>nsson, ''The Psychology of Interrogations and Confessions: A Handbook'', John Wiley and Sons, 2003 (herefter Gu<U+00F0>j<U+00F3>nsson 2003), pp. 464, 616.</ref> He was interviewed by Det Sgt van Thal and Det Insp John Kennedy ten times over a period of four days. He made several incriminating statements during the interviews, at first admitting he had thrown stones, then during the second interview saying he had seen the attack on Blakelock. During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview, Rose writes, he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: "It was like you see in a film, a helpless man with dogs on him. It was just like that, it was really quick." He did not sign this interview, Rose writes, and after it he vomited.<ref name=Rose162>Rose 1992, pp. 162<U+2013>164.</ref>

During a seventh interview the next day, he described noises he said Blakelock had made during the attack. During the eighth interview, he said he had armed himself that night with a broom handle, and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him. He said: "I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman, a broom handle." He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to "get in." Rose writes that he also offered the exact order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December, under the doctrine of [[common purpose]].<ref name=Rose162/>

Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, a rapper and disc jockey living with his parents in [[Islington]]. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, with whom he had a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was mentioned for the first time to detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 169<U+2013>170.</ref>

Braithwaite was taken to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar. He was held for three days and was at first denied access to a lawyer, on the instruction of Det Ch Supt Melvin. He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third.<ref name=Rose172/> During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat, and said in court <U+2013> as did several other suspects <U+2013> that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.<ref>Rose 1992, p. 182<U+2013>183.</ref>

He at first denied being anywhere near the Farm, then during interview four said he had been there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.<ref name=Rose172>Rose 1992, pp. 172<U+2013>173.</ref>

The charges against the youths were dismissed by the judge because they had been detained without access to parents or a lawyer. Four armoured police vehicles waited in Tottenham as the jury deliberated for three days. They returned on 19 March with a unanimous guilty verdict against Silcott, Raghip and Braithwaite; the men were sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that Silcott serve at least 30 years.<ref name=McKillop20Mar1987>James McKillop, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ei41AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_KULAAAAIBAJ&pg=2719,4624298&dq=mark-braithwaite+blakelock&hl=en "Second Life Sentence for Blakelock Killer"], ''The Glasgow Herald'', 20 March 1987.</ref> The black female juror fainted when the verdicts were read out.

===(1988) Application for leave to appeal rejected===
A campaign to free the "Tottenham Three" gathered pace, organized by the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign. They published an 18-page report in 1987 by two American law professors, Margaret Burnham and Lennox Hinds, who had attended part of the trial, and who wrote that Silcott's conviction "represents a serious miscarriage of justice."<ref>Margaret Burnham, ''The Burnham Report of International Jurists in Respect to Broadwater Farm Trials'', Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign, 1987, cited in Tompson 1988, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5P9A1R1ggakC&pg=PA49 p. 49].

Hinds"], Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences.</ref> Rose writes that the ''New Statesman'' and ''Time Out'' wrote sympathetic pieces, and MPs and trade unionists were lobbied. In May 1989 Silcott was even elected honorary president of the famously left-wing [[London School of Economics]] by its students' union, to the dismay of the college's director and governors. Silcott resigned shortly afterwards, saying he did not want the students to become scapegoats.<ref name=LSE>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3qYeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Pc4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3265,717142&dq=silcott+london-school-of-economics&hl=en "Britons vexed by election of cop killer"], Associated Press, 2 May 1989.

Engin Raghip's solicitor was now [[Gareth Peirce]] <U+2013> who had also represented the [[Guildford Four]] and [[Birmingham Six]], prominent cases of miscarriage of justice <U+2013> and his barrister [[Michael Mansfield]]. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession could not be relied upon. She arranged for him to be examined by Dr. [[G<U+00ED>sli Gu<U+00F0>j<U+00F3>nsson]] of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Gu<U+00F0>j<U+00F3>nsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by [[Barbara Mills]] and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire on the deck of the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 201<U+2013>203.</ref>

[[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]] (1918<U+2013>2005), then [[Lord Chief Justice of England]], dismissed the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip that the jury had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 201, 204<U+2013>205.</ref> [[Amnesty International]] criticized the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made in the absence of a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.<ref>David Pallister, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1991/mar/19/prisons-and-probation "Relatives renew Tottenham Three case plea"], ''The Guardian'', 19 March 1991.</ref> During a BBC ''Newsnight'' discussion of the case, [[Lord Scarman]] (1911<U+2013>2004), a former [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]], said the convictions ought to be overturned. Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist's report about Raghip and, supported by Raghip's MP [[Michael Portillo]], asked the Home Secretary to review the case. She also submitted an application to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. In December 1990 Home Secretary [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] referred the case back to the Court of Appeal.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 206<U+2013>207, 211<U+2013>212.</ref>

===(1990) Electrostatic Detection Analysis test===
{{see|Electrostatic detection device}}
In parallel with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview <U+2013> the notes he said were fabricated <U+2013> could be submitted for an Electrostatic Deposition/Detection Analysis (ESDA) test. The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.<ref name=Rose214/>

In Silcott's case, according to the scientist who conducted the ESDA test, Robert Radley, the notes from the section of the fifth interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself had been inserted after the other notes were written.<ref name=Rose18Jan2004/> The seventh and final page of the fifth interview, where the participants would normally sign, was missing.<ref name=Rose214>Rose 1992, pp. 214<U+2013>215.</ref> The ESDA test suggested that, on the third to sixth pages of the interview, no impressions had been left from previous pages, although these earlier impressions appeared throughout the rest of the notes. According to Will Bennett in ''The Independent'', the test "also revealed an imprint of a different page five from the one submitted in evidence which was clearly the same interview with Silcott but in which he made no implicit admissions."<ref name=Bennett29June1994/> In addition to this, David Baxendale, a Home Office forensic scientist who was asked to investigate by Essex police, said that the paper on which the disputed notes were written came from a different batch of paper from the rest of the interview.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 215<U+2013>216.</ref>

The disputed section of the interview had been written down by Det Insp Maxwell Dingle. It said that, when Silcott was told the police had witness statements that he had attacked Blakelock, he replied: "They are only kids. No one is going to believe them"; he reportedly said later: "Those kids will never go to court, you wait and see."<ref name=Bennett29June1994/> As a result of the ESDA test evidence, the Home Secretary added Silcott and Braithwaite to Raghip's appeal.<ref name=Rose214/>

===(1991) Appeal: ''R v Raghip and others''===
[[File:Royal Courts of Justice (England).jpg|200px|thumb|alt=photograph|The appeal was heard in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] on 25 November 1991.]]
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] heard the case on 25 November 1991, and took just 90 minutes to quash all three convictions, delivering their 74-page decision on 5 December.<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 214, 217.</ref> ''R v Raghip and others'' is regarded as a landmark ruling because it recognized that "interrogative suspectability" might make a confession unreliable.<ref name=Gudjonssonp464/>

Lawyers for the three argued that Silcott's interview notes were contaminated, and that Raghip's suggestibility and Braithwaite's having been denied a lawyer rendered their confessions unreliable too.<ref>Clive Walker, "Miscarriages of Justice in Principle and Practice," in Clive Walker and Keir Starmer (eds.), ''Miscarriages of Justice: A Review of Justice in Error'', Oxford University Press, 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?id=-99TY5gpVeIC&pg=PA50 p. 50].

Rose writes that Amlot's statement to the court was "one of the more sensational speeches in English legal history." Amlot said: "[W]e would not have gone on against Braithwaite, against Raghip, against any other defendants, having learned of the apparent dishonesty of the officer in charge of the case. I say that because the Crown has to depend on the honesty and integrity of officers in a case ... The impact is obviously severe."<ref>Rose 1992, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref>

===(1994) Detectives acquitted===
In July 1992 Det Ch Supt Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Det Insp Maxwell Dingle with conspiracy.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/police-face-trial-1532792.html "Police face trial"], ''The Independent'', 12 July 1992.</ref> None of the three people present during the disputed interview with Silcott <U+2013> Melvin, Dingle and Silcott himself <U+2013> gave evidence during the detectives' trial at the Old Bailey in June<U+2013>July 1994.<ref name=Bennett29June1994/>

Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and submitting items for forensic tests not available in 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, and according to the ''Evening Standard'' was one of the first on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house. Archaeologists dug up the garden, while surveyors used infra-red beams to create a three-dimensional map of the area. A machete was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet.<ref>Justin Davenport, [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-13457259-house-link-to-death-that-sparked-riot.do "House link to death that sparked riot"], ''London Evening Standard'', 28 September 2004.

The Crown Prosecution Service said in July 2013 that, although six of those arrested continued to be suspected of involvement, no action would be taken against five of them because there was "insufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution." The remaining suspect, Nicholas "Nicky" Jacobs (born 30 October 1968), was charged on 23 July with Blakelock's murder; Jacobs was almost 17 when Blakelock was killed.

==Awards and memorial==
In 1985, as a direct result of Blakelock's death, where it had not been clear who was in charge of the police operation on the night, a new "[[gold<U+2013>silver<U+2013>bronze command structure]]" (strategic<U+2013>tactical<U+2013>operational) was created that replaced ranks with roles. It is now used by all UK emergency services at every type of major incident.

In 1988 the constables of Serial 502 were awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]], Blakelock posthumously.
