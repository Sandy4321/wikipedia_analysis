==Etymology==
{{main|Names of Japan}}

The [[English language|English]] word ''Japan'' is an [[exonym]]. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] names for Japan are {{Nihongo|''Nippon''|<U+306B><U+3063><U+307D><U+3093>}} and {{nihongo|''Nihon''|<U+306B><U+307B><U+3093>}}. They are both written in Japanese using the [[kanji]] {{nihongo2|'''<U+65E5><U+672C>'''}}.  The Japanese name ''Nippon'' is used for most official purposes, including on [[Japanese yen|Japanese money]], [[postage stamp]]s, and for many international [[sport|sporting events]]. ''Nihon'' is a more casual term and the most frequently used in contemporary speech.

Both ''Nippon'' and ''Nihon'' literally mean "the sun's origin" and are often translated as the ''Land of the Rising Sun''. This nomenclature comes from [[Imperial embassies to China|Imperial correspondence]] with [[China|Chinese]] [[Sui Dynasty]] and refers to Japan's eastward position relative to [[China]]. Before Japan had relations with China, it was known as ''[[Yamato period|Yamato]]'' and ''Hi no moto'', which means "source of the sun".<ref>[http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/~ts/japanese/message/jpnEVwSABIuEVrrH_51.html Teach Yourself Japanese Message Board]</ref>

The English word for Japan came to the West from early trade routes. The early [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or possibly [[Wu Chinese]] (<U+5449><U+8A9E>) word for Japan was recorded by [[Marco Polo]] as ''Cipangu.'' In modern [[Shanghainese]], a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters {{nihongo2|<U+65E5><U+672C>}} 'Japan' is ''Zeppen'' {{IPAlink|z<U+0259><U+0294>p<U+0259>n}}; in Wu, the character <U+65E5> has two pronunciations, {{nihongo|informal|<U+767D><U+8B80>}} {{IPAlink|ni<U+0294>}} and {{nihongo|formal|<U+6587><U+8B80>}} {{IPAlink|z<U+0259><U+0294>}}. (In some southern Wu dialects, <U+65E5><U+672C> is pronounced {{IPAlink|ni<U+0294>p<U+0259>n}}, similar to its pronunciation in Japanese.)  The old [[Malay language|Malay]] word for Japan, ''Jepang'' (now spelled ''Jepun'' in Malaysia, though still spelled ''Jepang'' in Indonesia), was borrowed from a Chinese language, and this Malay word was encountered by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders in [[Malacca]] in the 16th century. It is thought the Portuguese traders were the first to bring the word to [[Europe]]. It was first recorded in English in a 1565 letter spelled ''Giapan''.  For more information on this, please see the [[wikt:Japan#Etymology|Wiktionary etymology for the word "Japan"]].

{{main|History of Japan}}

The first signs of occupation on the [[Japanese Archipelago]] appeared with a [[Japanese Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] culture around [[Upper Paleolithic|30,000&nbsp;BC]], followed from around [[Upper Paleolithic|14,000&nbsp;BC]] by the [[J<U+014D>mon period]], a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture of pit dwelling and a rudimentary form of [[agriculture]]. Decorated clay vessels from this period, often with plaited patterns, are some of the oldest surviving examples of [[pottery]] in the world.

The [[Yayoi period]], starting around the third century&nbsp;BC, saw the introduction of many new practices, such as wet-rice farming<ref>[[National Science Museum of Japan]] "Road of rice plant" [http://www.kahaku.go.jp/special/past/japanese/ipix/5/5-25.html]</ref>, [[iron]] and [[bronze]]-making and a new style of pottery, brought by migrants from [[China]] or [[Korea]]. 

The Japanese first appear in written history in China<U+2019>s ''[[Book of Han]]''. According to the Chinese ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'', the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called [[Yamataikoku]].

[[Buddhism]] was first introduced to Japan from [[Baekje]] of the [[Korean Peninsula]], but the subsequent development of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] and Buddhist sculptures were primarily influenced by [[China]].<ref>{{cite book |editor=Delmer M. Brown (ed.) |year=1993 |title=The Cambridge History of Japan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=140<U+2013>149}}</ref> Despite early resistance, [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was promoted by the ruling class and eventually gained growing acceptance since the [[Asuka period]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan |author=William Gerald Beasley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520225600&id=9AivK7yMICgC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=Soga+Buddhism+intitle:History+intitle:of+intitle:Japan&sig=V65JQ4OzTFCopEoFVb8DWh5BD4Q#PPA42,M1 |pages=42 |isbn=0520225600 |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>
[[File:Mooko-Suenaga.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281 were successfully repelled.]]

The [[Nara period]] of the eighth century marked the first emergence of a strong central Japanese state, centered on an imperial court in the city of [[Heij<U+014D> Palace|Heij<U+014D>-ky<U+014D>]], or modern day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. In addition to the continuing adoption of Chinese administrative practices, the [[Nara period]] is characterized by the appearance of a nascent written literature with the completion of the massive chronicles ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712) and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720).<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64<U+2013>79 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref> (Nara was not the first capital city in Japan, though. Before Nara, [[Fujiwara-ky<U+014D>]] and [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]] served as capitals of the Yamato state.)

In 784, [[Emperor Kammu]] moved the capital from Nara to [[Nagaoka-ky<U+014D>]] for a brief ten-year period, before relocating it to [[Heian-ky<U+014D>]] (modern day [[Kyoto]]) in 794, where it remained for more than a millennium.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=79<U+2013>87 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]], during which time a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]]. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki's]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of modern Japan's national anthem, ''[[Kimi ga Yo]]'' were written during this time.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conrad Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=122<U+2013>123 | isbn=978-1405123594}}</ref>
[[File:Sengoku period battle.jpg|thumb|left|An old Japanese painting depicting a [[List of Japanese battles|battle]] during the [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]] (1467<U+2013>1615).]]

Japan's [[feudalism|feudal]] era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the rival [[Taira clan]], [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[Shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[H<U+014D>j<U+014D> clan]] came to rule as regents for the shoguns. [[Zen]] Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185<U+2013>1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The [[Kamakura shogunate]] managed to repel [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, aided by a storm that the Japanese interpreted as a ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', or Divine Wind. The Kamakura shogunate was eventually [[Kemmu restoration|overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo]], who was soon himself defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[George Sansom]] |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334<U+2013>1615 |publisher=Stanford |pages=42 | isbn=0-8047-0525-9}}</ref> The succeeding [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed to control the feudal warlords (''[[daimyo]]''), and a civil war erupted (the [[<U+014C>nin War]]) in 1467 which opened a century-long [[Sengoku period]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[George Sansom]] |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334<U+2013>1615 |publisher=Stanford |pages=217 | isbn=0-8047-0525-9}}</ref>

During the sixteenth century, traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (''[[Nanban trade]]'').

[[Oda Nobunaga]] conquered numerous other daimyo by using European technology and [[firearm]]s and had almost unified the nation when he was assassinated in 1582. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] succeeded Nobunaga and united the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592<U+2013>1598)|invaded Korea twice]], but following several defeats by [[Korea]]n and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] [[China]] forces and Hideyoshi's death, Japanese troops were withdrawn in 1598.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Stephen Turnbull (historian)|Stephen Turnbull]] |year=2002 |title=Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War |publisher=Cassel |pages=227| isbn=978-0304359486}}</ref>

After Hideyoshi's death, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] utilized his position as regent for Hideyoshi's son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. Ieyasu was appointed [[shogun|sh<U+014D>gun]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]). The Tokugawa shogunate enacted a variety of measures such as ''[[Buke shohatto]]'' to control the autonomous daimyo. In 1639, the shogunate began the isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]]. The study of Western sciences, known as ''[[rangaku]]'', continued during this period through contacts with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] enclave at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. The Edo period also gave rise to ''[[kokugaku]]'', or literally "national studies", the study of Japan by the Japanese themselves.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/KOKUGAKU.HTM |title=Japan Glossary; Kokugaku | publisher = Washington State University | date=1999-07-14 | accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

On March 31, 1854, [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the "[[Black Ships]]" of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with the Western countries in the [[Bakumatsu]] period brought Japan into economic and political crises. The abundance of the prerogative and the resignation of the shogunate led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of [[Abolition of the han system|a centralized state]] unified under the name of the Emperor ([[Meiji Restoration]]). Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]], and assembled the [[Diet of Japan|Imperial Diet]]. The [[Meiji Restoration]] transformed the [[Empire of Japan]] into an [[industrialisation|industrialized]] world power that embarked on a number of military conflicts to expand the nation's sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894<U+2013>1895) and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904<U+2013>1905), Japan gained control of [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]], and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jearnol2/MeijiRestoration/imperial_japan.htm |title=Japan: The Making of a World Superpower (Imperial Japan) |author=Jesse Arnold | publisher = vt.edu/users/jearnol2 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The early twentieth century saw a brief period of "[[Taish<U+014D> period|Taisho democracy]]" overshadowed by the rise of [[expansionism]] and [[Japanese militarism|militarization]]. [[World War I]] enabled Japan, which joined the side of the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], to [[Japan during World War I|expand its influence and territorial holdings]]. Japan continued its expansionist policy by occupying [[Manchuria]] in 1931. As a result of [[Lytton Report|international condemnation for this occupation]], Japan resigned from the [[League of Nations]] two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]], joining the [[Axis powers]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.friesian.com/pearl.htm |title= The Pearl Harbor Strike Force |author= Kelley L.

In 1937, Japan invaded other parts of [[China]], precipitating the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937<U+2013>1945), after which the [[United States]] placed an oil embargo on Japan.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roland H.

On December 7, 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States naval base]] in [[Pearl Harbor]] and declared war on the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. This act brought the United States into [[World War II]]. After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] in 1945, along with [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|the Soviet Union joining the war against it]], Japan agreed to an [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] on August 15 ([[Victory over Japan Day]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.educationworld.net/txt15/surrend1.html |title=Japanese Instrument of Surrender |publisher=educationworld.net |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>  

The war cost Japan and countries part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] millions of lives and left much of the country's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allied powers repatriated millions of [[Japanese diaspora|ethnic Japanese]] from colonies throughout Asia.<ref>[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WATWHC.html When Empire Comes Home : Repatriation and Reintegration in Postwar Japan by Lori Watt], Harvard University Press</ref> The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], was convened by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (on May 3, 1946) to prosecute some Japanese leaders for [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]]. However, all members of the [[Unit 731|bacteriological research units]] and members of the imperial family involved in the conduct of the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces]].

In 1947, Japan adopted a new [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] emphasizing [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] practices. [[Occupation of Japan|The Allied occupation]] ended by the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1952<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070306f3.html |title='52 coup plot bid to rearm Japan: CIA |author=Joseph Coleman| date=2006-03-06| publisher=[[The Japan Times]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> and Japan was granted membership in the [[United Nations]] in 1956. Japan later achieved [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|spectacular growth]] to become the second largest economy in the world, with an annual growth rate averaging 10% for four decades. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered [[Japanese asset price bubble|a major recession]]. Positive growth in the early twenty-first century has signaled a gradual recovery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5178822.stm |title=Japan scraps zero interest rates |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2006-07-14 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{main|Government of Japan|Politics of Japan}}
[[File:Emperor Akihito and empress Michiko of japan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emperor Akihito]] and [[Empress Michiko]].]]

Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as "the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people". Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and other elected members of the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], while sovereignty is vested in the [[Japanese people]].<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/law/index.htm |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan |date=1946-11-03 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> The Emperor effectively acts as the [[head of state]] on diplomatic occasions. [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan. [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan]], stands as next in line to the throne.

Japan's legislative organ is the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], a bicameral [[parliament]]. The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]], containing 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved and a [[House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is [[universal suffrage]] for adults over 20 years of age,<ref name="ciawfbjapan">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html |title=World Factbook; Japan |publisher=[[CIA]] |date=2007-03-15 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> with a [[secret ballot]] for all elective offices.<ref name="Constitution"/> The [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) has been in power since 1955, except for a short-lived [[coalition government]] formed from opposition parties in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/english/history/index.html |title=A History of the Liberal Democratic Party |publisher=Liberal Democratic Party of Japan |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The largest opposition party is the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] [[Democratic Party of Japan]].

The Prime Minister of Japan is the [[head of government]]. The position is appointed by the [[Emperor of Japan]] after being designated by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] from among its members and must enjoy the confidence of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] to remain in office. The Prime Minister is the head of the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] (the literal translation of his Japanese title is "Prime Minister of the Cabinet") and appoints and dismisses the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]], a majority of whom must be Diet members. [[Taro Aso]] currently serves as the Prime Minister of Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/index-e.html |title=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Japan| accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> 

Historically influenced by [[Chinese law]], the [[law of Japan|Japanese legal system]] developed independently during the [[Edo period]] through texts such as ''[[Kujikata Osadamegaki]]''. However, since the late nineteenth century, the [[judicial system of Japan|judicial system]] has been largely based on the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[Europe]], notably [[France]] and [[Germany]]. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a [[civil code]] based on the German model. With post-World War II modifications, the code remains in effect in present-day Japan.<ref name="civilcode">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043364?hook=6804 |title="Japanese Civil Code" |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature, the National Diet of Japan, with the [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] approval of the Emperor. The current constitution requires that the Emperor promulgates legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose the passing of the legislation.<ref name="Constitution"/> Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] and three levels of lower courts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/judiciary/0620system.html |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Japan |title=The Japanese Judicial System |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The main body of Japanese statutory law is a collection called the [[Six Codes]].<ref name="civilcode"/>

Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors: with [[Russia]] over the [[Kuril Islands dispute|South Kuril Islands]], with [[South Korea]] over the [[Liancourt Rocks]], with the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] over the [[Senkaku Islands]], and with the PRC over the [[EEZ]] around [[Okinotorishima]]. 

Japan also faces an ongoing dispute with [[North Korea]] over its [[North Korean abductions of Japanese|abduction of Japanese citizens]] and its [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons and missile program]] (see also [[Six-party talks]]). As a result of the Kuril Islands dispute, Japan is technically still at war with Russia since no treaty resolving the issue was ever signed.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html CIA - The World Factbook - Russia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Japan's military is restricted by the [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]], which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force as a means of settling international disputes. Japan's military is governed by the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]], and primarily consists of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF), the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) and the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF).

While there exist eight commonly defined [[regions of Japan]], administratively Japan consists of [[Prefectures of Japan|forty-seven prefectures]], each overseen by an elected governor, legislature and administrative bureaucracy. The [[Tokyo City|former city of Tokyo]] is further divided into [[Special wards of Tokyo|twenty-three special wards]], each with the same powers as cities.

The nation is currently undergoing administrative [[Merger and dissolution of municipalities of Japan|reorganization by merging]] many of the cities, towns and villages with each other. This process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mabuchi |first=Masaru |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/WBI/Resources/wbi37175.pdf |title=''Municipal Amalgamation in Japan'' (PDF) |publisher=World Bank |month=May | year=2001 | accessdate=2006-12-28|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Japan}}
[[File:Mountfujijapan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Fuji]] with [[cherry blossom]] trees and a [[shinkansen]] in the foreground<U+2014>all three are iconic of Japan.]]

Japan is a country of over three thousand islands extending along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of Asia. The main islands, running from north to south, are [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]], [[Honsh<U+016B>]] (the main island), [[Shikoku]] and [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]], including [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], are a chain of islands south of Kyush<U+016B>. Together they are often known as the [[Japanese Archipelago]].

About 70% to 80% of the country is [[forest]]ed, mountainous,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566679/Japan.html |title="Japan" |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldinfozone.com/country.php?country=Japan |title=Japan Information<U+2014>Page 1 |publisher=WorldInfoZone.com |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use. This is because of the generally steep elevations, climate and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas. Japan is one of the [[list of countries by population density|most densely populated countries]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=World Population Prospects |publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

Its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], at the juncture of three tectonic plates, gives Japan frequent low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Destructive [[earthquake]]s, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times each century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_asia/japan_tec.html |title=Tectonics and Volcanoes of Japan |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> The most recent major quakes are the [[2004 Ch<U+016B>etsu earthquake]] and the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin Earthquake]] of 1995. [[Onsen|Hot springs]] are numerous and have been developed as resorts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/attractions/hotSprings.html |title=Attractions: Hot Springs |publisher=[[JNTO]] |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]], but varies greatly from north to south.<ref name="climate">{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/essential/climate.html |title=Essential Info: Climate |publisher=[[JNTO]] |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones:
* [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]]: The northernmost zone has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter.
* [[Sea of Japan]]: On Honsh<U+016B>'s west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, because of the [[foehn wind]] phenomenon.
* [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]]: A typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light.
* [[Inland Sea|Seto Inland Sea]]: The mountains of the [[Ch<U+016B>goku region|Ch<U+016B>goku]] and [[Shikoku]] regions shelter the region from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year.
* [[Pacific Ocean]]: The east coast experiences cold winters with little snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.
* [[Ryukyu Islands]]: The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. [[tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are common.

The highest temperature ever measured in Japan <U+2014> 40.9 degrees Celsius <U+2014> was recorded on August 16, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/national/20070816page_id=1553 |title=Gifu Prefecture sees highest temperature ever recorded in Japan - 40.9 |publisher=Japan News Review Society |date=2007-08-16| accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>

The main [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] begins in early May in Okinawa, and the stationary rain front responsible for this gradually works its way north until it dissipates in northern Japan before reaching Hokkaid<U+014D> in late July. In most of Honsh<U+016B>, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.<ref name="climate"/>

Japan is home to nine forest [[ecoregions in Japan|ecoregions]] which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] in the Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> and Bonin islands, to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to [[temperate coniferous forest]]s in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/spotflora.htm |title=Flora and Fauna: Diversity and regional uniqueness |publisher=Embassy of Japan in the USA |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref>

==Environment==
:{{main|Environmental issues in Japan}}

Japan's environmental history and current policies reflect a tenuous balance between economic development and environmental protection. In the rapid economic growth after [[World War II]], environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations. As an inevitable consequence, some crucial environmental pollution (see [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan|Pollution in Japan]]) occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. In the rising concern over the problem, the government introduced many environmental protection laws<ref>[http://www.erca.go.jp/taiki/history/ko_syousyu.html <U+65E5><U+672C><U+306E><U+5927><U+6C17><U+6C5A><U+67D3><U+306E><U+6B74><U+53F2>], Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency</ref> in 1970 and established the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] in 1971. The [[1973 oil crisis|Oil crisis in 1973]] also encouraged the efficient use of energy due to Japan's lack of natural resources.<ref>[http://nice.erina.or.jp/en/pdf/C-SEKIYAMA.pdf Japan' international cooperation for energy efficiency & conservation in Asian region.], Takeshi Sekiyama, Energy Conservation Center, 2008</ref> Current priority environmental issues include urban [[air pollution]] ([[NOx]], suspended particulate matter, toxics), [[waste management]], water eutrophication, [[nature conservation]], [[climate change]], chemical management and international co-operation for environmental conservation.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/17/2110905.pdf OECD Environmental Performance Review of Japan], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]</ref>

Today Japan is one of the world's leaders in the development of new environment-friendly technologies. [[Honda]] and [[Toyota]] [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s were named to have the highest [[fuel economy]] and lowest [[emission]]s.<ref>[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/vehicles_health/automaker-rankings-2007.html Automaker Rankings 2007: The Environmental Performance of Car Companies], [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], 10/15/07.</ref>  This is due to the advanced technology in hybrid systems, biofuels, use of lighter weight material and better engineering.

Japan also takes issues surrounding [[climate change]] and [[global warming]] seriously. As a signatory of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and host of the 1997 conference which created it, Japan is under treaty obligations to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps related to curbing climate change. The [[Cool Biz campaign]] introduced under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning use in government offices. Japan is preparing to force industry to make big cuts in greenhouse gases, taking the lead in a country struggling to meet its [[Kyoto Protocol]] obligations.<ref>[http://www.wbcsd.org/plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?type=DocDet&ObjectId=MzAyNzQ World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Japan is ranked 30th best in the world in the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]].<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/esi/ESI2005_Main_Report.pdf 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index Benchmarking National Environmental Stewardship], [[Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy]], [[Yale University]] and [[Center for International Earth Science Information Network]], [[Columbia University]], 2005.</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Japan}}
[[File:Tokyo stock exchange.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] is the world's second largest [[stock exchange]].]]

From 1868, [[Meiji period]] launched economic expansion. Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a free market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. Japanese went to study overseas and Western scholars were hired to teach in Japan. Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time. Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, overall real economic growth has been called [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|a "Japanese miracle"]]: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and a 4% average in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-7176.html |title=Japan: Patterns of Development |publisher=country-data.com |month=January | year=1994 |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s, largely because of the after-effects of [[Japanese asset price bubble]] and domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets.

In Japan, healthcare services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |author=Victor Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

Japanese culture has evolved greatly over the years, from the country's original [[J<U+014D>mon period|J<U+014D>mon]] culture to its contemporary culture, which combines influences from [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Traditional [[Japanese art]]s include [[Japanese handicrafts|crafts]] ([[ikebana]], [[origami]], [[ukiyo-e]], [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]], [[lacquer]]ware, [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]]), performances ([[bunraku]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[rakugo]]), traditions ([[List of Japanese games|games]], [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Bud<U+014D>]], [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], [[Japanese garden|gardens]], [[Katana|swords]]) and [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]]. The fusion of traditional [[woodblock printing]] and Western art led to the creation of [[manga]], a typically Japanese [[comic book]] format that is now popular within and outside Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.co.jp/museum/nmp/nmp_i/articles/manga/manga1.html |title= A History of Manga |publisher=NMP International |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> Manga-influenced [[animation]] for television and film is called [[anime]]. Japanese-made [[video game console]]s have prospered since the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hov/index.html |title= The History of Video Games |author= Leonard Herman, Jer Horwitz, Steve Kent, and Skyler Miller|publisher=[[Gamespot]] |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> 

[[Music of Japan|Japanese music]] is eclectic, having borrowed instruments, scales and styles from neighboring cultures. Many instruments, such as the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], were introduced in the ninth and tenth centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the fourteenth century and the popular folk music, with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.<ref>Japanese Culture, The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], 1983 edition, <U+00A9> [[Columbia University Press]] ISBN 0-380-63396-5</ref> [[Western music]], introduced in the late nineteenth century, now forms an integral part of the culture. Post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European modern music, which has led to the evolution of popular band music called [[J-pop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1550807,00.html |title= J-Pop History |publisher=[[The Observer]]| accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> 

[[Karaoke]] is the most widely practiced cultural activity. A November 1993 survey by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Cultural Affairs Agency]] found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional cultural pursuits such as [[floristry|flower arranging]] or [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]].<ref>Kelly, Bill. (1998). "Japan's Empty Orchestras: Echoes of Japanese culture in the performance of karaoke", ''The Worlds of Japanese Popular Culture: Gender, Shifting Boundaries and Global Cultures'', p. 76.

The earliest works of [[Japanese literature]] include two history books the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and the eighth century poetry book ''[[Man'y<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]]'', all written in Chinese characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/2000/200015.htm |title= Asian Studies Conference, Japan (2000) |publisher=Meiji Gakuin University |accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> In the early days of the [[Heian period]], the system of transcription known as ''kana'' ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) was created as phonograms. ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'' is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.<ref name="ispmsu">{{cite web |url=http://www.isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |title= Windows on Asia<U+2014>Literature : Antiquity to Middle Ages: Recent Past |publisher=Michigan State University, Office of International Studies and Programs |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> An account of Heian court life is given by ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' written by [[Sei Sh<U+014D>nagon]], while ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki]] is often described as the world's first novel. During the [[Edo period]], literature became not so much the field of the samurai aristocracy as that of the [[ch<U+014D>nin]], the ordinary people. [[Yomihon]], for example, became popular and reveals this profound change in the readership and authorship.<ref name="ispmsu"/> The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms, during which Japanese literature integrated Western influences. [[Natsume S<U+014D>seki]] and [[Mori <U+014C>gai]] were the first "modern" novelists of Japan, followed by [[Ry<U+016B>nosuke Akutagawa]], [[Jun'ichir<U+014D> Tanizaki]], [[Yasunari Kawabata]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and, more recently, [[Haruki Murakami]]. Japan has two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize-winning]] authors <U+2014> [[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1968) and [[Kenzaburo Oe]] (1994).<ref name="ispmsu"/>

==Sports==
{{main|Sport in Japan}}
[[File:Sumo tournament.jpg|thumb|A [[sumo]] tournament at the Grand Tournament in [[Osaka]].]]

Traditionally, [[sumo]] is considered Japan's [[national sport]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/sumoeastandwest/sumo.html |title=Sumo: East and West |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> and it is a popular spectator sport in Japan. [[Japanese martial arts|Martial arts]] such as [[judo]], [[karate]] and [[kendo|kend<U+014D>]] are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced in Japan and began to spread through the education system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/facts/culture_dailylife.html#sports |title=Culture and Daily Life |publisher=Embassy of Japan in the UK |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref> 

The [[Nippon Professional Baseball|professional baseball league in Japan]] was established in 1936.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nagata, Yoichi and Holway, John B. |editor=Pete Palmer |title=Total Baseball |edition=fourth edition |year=1995 |publisher=Viking Press |location=New York |pages=547 |chapter=Japanese Baseball}}</ref> Today [[baseball]] is the most popular [[spectator sport]] in the country. One of the most famous Japanese baseball players is [[Ichiro Suzuki]], who, having won Japan's Most Valuable Player award in 1994, 1995 and 1996, now plays in North American [[Major League Baseball]].  Prior to that, [[Sadaharu Oh]] was well-known outside Japan, having hit more [[home runs]] during his career in Japan than his contemporary, [[Hank Aaron]], did in America.

Since the establishment of the [[J. League|Japan Professional Football League]] in 1992, [[Football in Japan|association football (soccer)]] has also gained a wide following.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tjf.or.jp/takarabako/PDF/TB09_JCN.pdf |title= Soccer as a Popular Sport: Putting Down Roots in Japan |publisher= The Japan Forum |format = [[PDF]] | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> Japan was a venue of the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] with [[South Korea]]. Japan is one of the most successful soccer teams in Asia, winning the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]] three times.

[[Golf]] is also popular in Japan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/604/sports.asp |title= Japanese Golf Gets Friendly |publisher=[[Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)|Metropolis]] |author=Fred Varcoe|accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> as are forms of [[auto racing]], such as the [[Super GT]] sports car series and [[Formula Nippon]] formula racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/623/sports.asp |title= Japanese Omnibus: Sports |publisher=[[Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)|Metropolis]] |author=Len Clarke|accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> [[Twin Ring Motegi]] was completed in 1997 by [[Honda]] in order to bring [[IndyCar]] racing to Japan.
