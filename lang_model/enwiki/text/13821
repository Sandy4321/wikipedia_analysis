The '''Oregon Supreme Court''' ('''OSC''') is the highest [[state court]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. The only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref name=OJD>[http://www.ojd.state.or.us/aboutus/courtsintro/index.htm An Introduction to the Courts of Oregon.] Oregon Judicial Department. Retrieved on June 11, 2008.</ref> The OSC holds court at the [[Oregon Supreme Court Building]] in [[Salem, Oregon]], near the [[Oregon State Capitol|capitol]] building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while the courtroom is also used by the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]].

Tracing its heritage back to 1841 when Oregon pioneers selected a supreme judge with probate powers, the court has grown from a single judge to its current make up of seven justices. Justices of the court serve six year terms upon election, however vacancies are filled by appointments of the [[Governor of Oregon]] until the next general election when any qualified candidate may run for the position including the appointee. These seven justices then select one member to serve a six-year term as [[Chief Justice]]. The court<U+2019>s Chief Justice is not only responsible for assigning cases to the other justices to write the court<U+2019>s opinions, but is also the chief executive of the [[Oregon Judicial Department]].

Primarily an appeals court, the Oregon Supreme Court is also the court of last resort in Oregon. Although most [[oral arguments]] before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools. All cases are heard [[en banc]] by the court. It receives appeals from the [[Oregon Tax Court]], the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the ''Oregon Reporter'' published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the [[Oregon Territory]] was formed out of the old [[Oregon Country]] region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.

==Selection==
The court is composed of seven elected [[judge|justices]], each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a [[nonpartisan]] election.<ref name="SOS2"> {{cite web  |title=Oregon Supreme Court   |work=Oregon Blue Book  |publisher=Oregon Secretary of State  |url= http://www.bluebook.state.or.us/state/judicial/judicial01.htm  |accessdate=2006-12-09 }}</ref> Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be [[United States citizen]]s, Oregon [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] for at least three years, and lawyers [[bar (law)|admitted]] to practice in the state of Oregon.<ref name="SOS2"/> The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed <U+201C>the broom closet<U+201D>) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted.<ref name=tradition>Suo, Steve.

===Chief Justice===
{{see also|List of Chief Justices of the Oregon Supreme Court}}
One justice of the court is elected by the court to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice.<ref name=OJD/> The Chief Justice is then responsible for all administration of the Supreme Court.<ref name=OJD/> Under a law enacted in 1981 the chief is not only the titular head of the Supreme Court, but also is the chief executive officer of the Oregon Judicial Department.<ref name=OJD/><ref name=map/> In that role the Chief Justice supervises all of the Oregon courts, appoints the Chief Judge of the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]], assigns presiding judges for the trial level state courts, makes court rules, and is in charge of the department<U+2019>s budget.<ref name=OJD/> As administrator the chief is also the recipient of many reports from the court system including non-legal employees of the department.<ref name="SOS2"/> The first Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court was [[William P. Bryant]], while the longest serving chief was [[Wallace P. Carson, Jr.]] who held the position for 15 years.<ref name="SOS"/>

===Oregon Reports===
Beginning in 1853, the [[Law report|official court reporter]] for the publication of all Supreme Court decisions was the Oregon Reports, abbreviated ''Or.'' or ''Ore.'' in [[Case citation|case citations]].<ref name=pub>[http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/ Appellate Court Opinions.] Oregon Judicial Department. Retrieved on October 16, 2007.</ref> These bound editions are published under the authority of the Oregon Supreme Court as authorized by state law.<ref name=pub/><ref>Oregon Revised Statutes 2.150</ref> 

[[Joseph G. Wilson]] started in 1853 as the clerk for the court and was responsible for the Oregon Reports until 1870, though he also served as a justice on the court from 1862 to 1870.<ref name="Kincaid"/> Later federal judge [[Charles B. Bellinger]] then took over editing the reports, and served as clerk until 1880.<ref name="Kincaid"/> He was followed by T. B. Odeneal, J. A. Stratton, and W. H. Holmes, until 1889 when a law was passed that included a provision that the Chief Justice take over this responsibility.<ref name="Kincaid"/> This arrangement only lasted a few years, as in 1891 a new law allowed the court to hire an official reporter, with later Chief Justice [[George H. Burnett]] serving as the first official reporter.<ref name="Kincaid"/>

The first reported opinion in the Oregon Reports was ''Thompson v. Backenstos'', involving a case about [[trespass]]ing.<ref name=or1>''Thompson v. Backenstos'', 1 Or. 17, 1853 WL 469, 1853 Ore. LEXIS 1 (1853).</ref> In the case, Justice [[George Henry Williams]] wrote the opinion, Justice [[Thomas Nelson (Oregon judge)|Thomas Nelson]] had served as the judge at the trial level due to circuit riding, while future justice [[Reuben P. Boise]] served as counsel for the defense, and fellow future justice [[Aaron E. Waite]] provided counsel for the plaintiff.<ref name=or1/>

==Powers and jurisdiction==
[[File:ORSCcourtroomdoors2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Stained glass]] above the [[courtroom]] entrance]]
The powers of the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution<U+2019>s Article VII.<ref name="SOS2"/> Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts primarily as a [[court of appeal]]s. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions.<ref name="SOS2"/> In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court.<ref name="SOS2"/> Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/glossary/index.php?term=discretionary%20review Glossary: discretionary review.] Texas Politics. Retrieved on October 16, 2007.</ref> With those cases that are denied an appeal to the Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding.<ref name="SOS2"/> As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary.<ref name=tradition/> The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings.<ref name=tradition/> Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case [[en banc]]. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice [[Judicial disqualification|recuses]] themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.

The court also reviews death penalty cases, [[Oregon Tax Court|state tax court]] appeals, and items regarding legal discipline on direct review.<ref name=OJD/> Direct review means that the Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals.<ref name=OJD/> Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions.<ref name=OJD/> Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of [[mandamus]], writs [[quo warranto]], writs of [[habeas corpus]], reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to [[ballot measure]]s such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter<U+2019>s Pamphlet.<ref name=OJD/>

Oregon<U+2019>s state courts are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts.<ref name=civpro>Rowe, Thomas D., Suzanna Sherry, and Jay Tidmarsh. ''Civil Procedure''. Foundation Press, NY: 2004.</ref> That is, the state courts can hear all cases regardless of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions.<ref name=civpro/> Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law.<ref name=civpro/> Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts.<ref name=civpro/> Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state.<ref name=civpro/> However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the [[Erie Doctrine]] developed by the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref name=civpro/> For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see [[Oregon Revised Statutes|ORS]] 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).<ref>[http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S51989.htm Lombardo v. Warner.] 340 Or. 264, 132 P.3d 22, (2006).</ref><ref name=civpro/><ref name=OJD/>

Although only the United States Supreme Court can overturn the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case.<ref name=civpro/> The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see [[adequate and independent state ground]]). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law.<ref>[http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/jcoc2ay.htm Congress Versus the Courts.] United States House of Representatives. Retrieved on October 16, 2007.</ref><ref name=civpro/> Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] or through the initiative and referendum process.<ref name=con>[http://law.justia.com/oregon/constitution/ Oregon State Constitution.] Justia.com. Retrieved on October 16, 2007.</ref> Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon<U+2019>s Governor or the [[President of the United States]] may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).<ref name=con/>

[[Image:ORSCcourtroomstainedglass.JPG|thumb|Stained glass ceiling of the courtroom.]]
Following the journey of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805, the region known as [[Oregon Country]] experienced increased activity and exploration by Europeans and Americans. Beginning with the [[fur trade]], settlement by Euro-Americans began as early as 1811 with the founding of [[Fort Astoria]] and slowly increased until the 1830s.<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M. (1989) ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 13, 186.</ref> In the 1830s additional settlement occurred, agricultural production increased, and missionaries started religious missions in the region. In 1835, the first trial in the region was held with [[John Kirk Townsend]] presiding as magistrate over a murder charge.<ref name="OSU">{{cite web |last=Jobanek |first=George A. |title=Narrative of a Journey |work=New and Recent OSU Press Books |publisher=OSU Press |url= http://oregonstate.edu/dept/press/m-n/NaraofaJourneyIntro.html |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref>  Pioneer settlers continued to immigrate to the region, with larger wagon trains crossing the [[Oregon Trail]] in the 1840s bringing more immigrants and a need for courts.<ref name=Oregon/>

===Pre-statehood===
The Oregon Supreme Court traces its roots back to the early settlement period of [[Oregon Country]]. In 1841, pioneer [[Ewing Young]] died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of [[Idaho]], [[Washington]], and Oregon.<ref name="PDoOH">{{cite book  |last=Clarke  |first=S.A.  |title=Pioneer Days of Oregon History  |publisher=J.K.

Babcock]], serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.<ref name="SOS"> {{cite web  |title=Oregon Supreme Court Justices  |work=Oregon Blue Book  |publisher=Oregon Secretary of State  |url= http://www.bluebook.state.or.us/state/elections/elections27.htm  |accessdate=2006-12-09 }}</ref>

In 1843, a later set of meetings at Champoeg created the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]] with a judiciary consisting of a supreme judge and two [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]] for trial level courts.<ref name=Gray>Gray, William H. ''A History of Oregon, 1792-1849, Drawn from Personal Observation and Authentic Information''. Harris & Holman: Portland, OR. 1870.</ref> [[Albert E. Wilson]] was the first judge chosen as the supreme judge under this new government, but never severed. Other judges were appointed or elected during this pre-territory period over the next six years.<ref name="SOS"/> Until 1846 with the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power. With the resolution of the boundary issue, Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude, with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control [[California]].<ref name=Gray/>

In 1848, when the [[Oregon Territory]] was created by the [[United States Congress]], [[William P. Bryant]]  was appointed as the first judge of the Oregon Supreme Court.<ref name="SOS"/> Justices in the territorial period were appointed by the [[President of the United States]].<ref name="SOS"/> In those early days of the court, the justices would <U+201C>[[Circuit rider (U.S. Court system)|ride circuit]]<U+201D> in addition to their appellate court functions.

===Oregon State Supreme Court===
Beginning with statehood in 1859, the court had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state.<ref name="horner">{{cite book|last=Horner|first=John B.|title=Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature|publisher=The J.K.

Then in 1862 the court was expanded to five justices with the addition of a fifth judicial district. Also that year the Court hired its first clerk after the legislature authorized that position.<ref>Terry, John. "The many names and owners of the Lewis and Clark Bridge", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', October 5, 1997.</ref> In 1878, the legislature passed an act to separate the circuit and supreme courts after the population reached 100,000.<ref name="Kincaid"/> With the creation of a separate Circuit Court and Supreme Court, riding circuit was abandoned<ref name="SOS"/> and the Supreme Court was reduced to three members, with members of each court elected separately.<ref name="horner"/><ref name="Kincaid"/> Governor [[W. W. Thayer|Thayer]] then appointed [[James K. Kelly]], [[Reuben P. Boise]], and [[Paine Page Prim]] to the court as temporary justices until elections could be held. During these early years of the court the selection of the Chief Justice was governed by the Oregon Constitution, with the senior justice or the justice with their term was next to expire was designated as the Chief Justice.<ref name="Kincaid"/> This meant that a new chief would be selected at least every two years, and in general meant someone elected would serve their first four years on the bench as an associate justice and the last two years as the Chief Justice.<ref name="Kincaid"/>

[[Mary Leonard]] became the first woman admitted to the state bar on April 13, 1886, when the court admitted her after a year-long battle that included the state legislature passing a new law to allow women to be admitted.<ref name=Stanford>Abrams, Kerry.

[[Image:ORSCfacade.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior of Supreme Court Building.]]
The next important case came in 1935 when the state's top court ruled in ''State v. De Jonge'', 152 Or. 315, 51 P.2d 674 (1935) that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] did not protect [[Communist Party]] organizers from prosecution under Oregon<U+2019>s criminal syndicate law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn this decision in ''[[DeJonge v. Oregon]]'', 299 U.S. 353 (1937). Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in ''State Land Board v. United States'', 222 Or. 40, 352 P.2d 539 (1960). In that case the court ruled that state [[Estate (law)|estate]] laws trumped a federal statute concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at [[Veterans Administration]] hospitals without a valid will. The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court's decision in ''[[United States v. Oregon (1961)|United States v. Oregon]]'', 366 U. S. 643 (1961).<ref>''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/366/643/case.html United States v. Oregon,]'' 366 US 643 (1961). Justia.com. Retrieved on October 16, 2007.</ref>

On the administrative end of the court, the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] was created in 1969 as an intermediate appellate court in Oregon. With this change, the Supreme Court now generally does not hear appeals directly from the trial level courts of the state, with some exceptions such as death penalty cases. Other changes came in 1981 when the [[Oregon Legislature]] and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head of the court in title only, to the administrative head of the entire Oregon judicial system.<ref name=carson>Wong, Peter.

The next landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the Oregon Supreme Court was ''[[Dolan v. City of Tigard]]'', 512 U.S. 374 (1994).

Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon<U+2019>s land use law, [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)|Measure 37]], was constitutional. ''[[Greg Macpherson|Macpherson]] v. Department of Administrative Services'', 340 Or. 117, 130 P.3d 308 (2006) allowed people to make claims against the government forcing the government to either pay compensation when land use regulations reduced the value of a property owners land or waive the regulation.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/index.cfm?c=djjga City of Portland and Measure 37.] City of Portland.

==Notable Supreme Court cases==
[[Image:ORSCcourtroomdoors.JPG|thumb|140px|Entrance to the courtroom.]]
Over the course of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number decisions as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover a wide-range of topics from the constitutionality of various [[ballot measure]]s to contract law to torts and even to the location of the [[Oregon State Capital|capital]] when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.
