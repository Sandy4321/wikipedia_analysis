'''Jerry M. Reinsdorf''' (born [[February 25]] [[1936]]) is a [[Certified Public Accountant|C.P.A.]], lawyer, and the majority owner of both the [[Chicago White Sox]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]].  He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 20 years.  He made his initial fortune in [[real estate]] taking advantage of the [[Frank Lyon Co. v. United States]] decision in the [[United States Supreme Court]] which allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back while transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner.  He has become a sports owner with a reputation for frugality.

As the owner and Chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he has turned the franchise into a lucrative business that won six [[NBA Finals|World Championships]] in the 1990s (1991&ndash;1993 and 1996&ndash;1998). He is controversial for his involvement (along with [[Jerry Krause]]) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring back key personel such as [[Phil Jackson]] and [[Michael Jordan]].  He hired Jordan as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball.  He also moved the Bulls from [[Chicago Stadium]] to the [[United Center]].

As a baseball owner since 1981, he has brought success to the White Sox franchise.  The franchise made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959 and won the [[World Series]] in 2005 for the first time since 1917.  He moved the White Sox from [[Comiskey Park]] to [[New Comiskey Park]] and then renaming the new park U.S. Cellular Field. In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an anti-labor union hardliner.  Since the early 1990s, he has been considered one of the most, if not the most, influential baseball owners.  He has been influential in instituting the [[salary cap]] and [[revenue sharing]].  He has also shaped the modern era of baseball by organizing the lucrative [[internet]] arm of baseball.

In the 1980s, Reinsdorf, Bud Selig and the [[American League]] President colluded to dissuade the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] from signing [[Lance Parrish]] who was a [[Detroit Tigers]] [[free agent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1683340,00.html|title=A-Rod's Salary: Watching for Collusion|accessdate=2008-10-06|date=2007-11-13|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Gregory, Sean}}</ref> During the strike, Reinsdorf, who was an anti-union hard-liner,<ref name="AOWWPBWTOB" /> was so pessimistic that he did not expect baseball to resume until the [[1996 Major League Baseball season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/115694/page/2|title=In This Game It's Hard To Root For Either Side: Sports: A Strike May Abort A Grand Baseball Season|accessdate=2008-10-06|date=1994-08-08|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=[[Newsweek]]|author=Starr, Mark}}</ref>  In the early 1990s he was able to get new stadia ([[United Center]] and [[U.S. Cellular Field]]) for his teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/120868/page/20|title=The Rise Of The Overclass|accessdate=2008-10-06|date=1995-07-31|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=[[Newsweek]]|author=Adler, Jerry}}</ref>

Some fans and columnists have accused Reinsdorf of breaking up the championship Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]] could have competed for more titles with [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and good support from the rest of the team that in the eight-year span included [[Dennis Rodman]], [[Horace Grant]], [[Toni Kukoc]], [[Ron Harper]], [[BJ Armstrong]], and coach [[Phil Jackson]].  Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were linked to Jackson, the team was broken up.<ref name="TOAO" />  ''[[Forbes]]'' describes the scenario as an example of owner greed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com//forbes/1998/0309/6105088a.html|title=Out, out, damned word!|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=1998-03-09|publisher= Forbes.com LLC.|work=[[Forbes]]|author=Seligman, Dan}}</ref>  Many note that Phil Jackson's decision not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA season]] [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] impacted the decisions of several player on whether to return to Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990072,00.html|title=Splitting Bulls|accessdate=2008-10-05|date=1999-01-25|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Grace, Julie and Joel Stein}}</ref>  Krause and Reinsdorf had held out hope that they could convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced [[Tim Floyd]] as President of Chicago Bulls Basketball Operations instead of [[head coach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988836,00.html|title=

Reinsdorf has reported quoted that he would swap all six NBA Bulls Championships for the one White Sox championship, clearly showing his love for Baseball over Basketball. He flatly refuses to allow the Bulls to go over the salary cap and into the luxury tax domain in his quest for a return to the Championship years of the Bulls.

===Legacy===
Reinsdorf is largely responsible for the [[revenue sharing]] of the [[internet]] rights of Major League Baseball in which all teams have shared equally since Major League Baseball Advanced Media (known as BAM) was established in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/33954|title=Covering All the Online Bases: The digital business of Major League Baseball started out as a mess. Now it has $400 million in revenue and may revolutionize the economics of the sport.|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=[[Newsweek]]|author=Levy, Steven}}</ref>  Reinsdorf also endeavored to sell the naming rights to the New Comiskey Park to [[U.S. Cellular]] in a $68 million 20-year deal that funded a 7-year $85 million overhaul of the stadium that ended prior to the [[2008 Major League Baseball season]].  The overhaul included the removal of top rows of the hated upper deck, replacement of the [[baby blue]] seats with traditionally-colored green ones and dozens of other upgrades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2008/04/07/white-sox-cellular-face-markets-cz_zog_0407autofacescan01.html|title=White Sox Dress Up Their Home|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=2008-04-07|publisher= Forbes.com LLC.|work=[[Forbes]]|author=Greenburg, Zack O'Malley}}</ref>  Prior to the 7 year overhaul, the 2001 White Sox barely broke even financially with a $700,000 operating profit on revenues of $101.33 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2002/0415/092add2.html|title=MLB Owners (Current)|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=2002-04-15|publisher= Forbes.com LLC.|work=[[Forbes]]}}</ref>

Reinsdorf won a major revenue sharing legal battle with other NBA owners over the Chicago Bulls broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]].  The 55 game schedule on the superstation for an audience of 35 million competed with the NBA broadcasts, but Reinsdorf was permitted to maintain the contract.<ref name="TT#IS">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1992/b327051.arc.htm|title=THE TOUGHEST #&?!%* IN SPORTS|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=1992-06-15|publisher=[[The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.]]|work=[[BusinessWeek]]}}</ref>  As recently as 2004, the Bulls continued to be the NBAs most profitable team, earning $49 million in [[operating income]] and having an estimated valuation of $356 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2004/0216/064tab.html|title=2004 Team Valuations|accessdate=2008-10-07|date=2004-02-16|publisher= Forbes.com LLC.|work=[[Forbes]]|author=Fluke, Cecily, Lesley Kump, and Michael K.

Reinsdorf feels that if [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] chief, [[Donald Fehr]], had not opposed [[steroid]] testing, baseball would have taken a stand against steroid use much sooner.  He feels that in the end this delayed action will cost some players election into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fanhouse.com/2008/04/09/white-sox-owner-jerry-reinsdorf-blames-don-fehr-for-steroid-era/|title=Jerry Reinsdorf: 'Steroids Strictly a Don Fehr Problem and Creation'|accessdate=2008-10-08|publisher=AOL LLC|work=FanHouse|author=Watson, Mark}}</ref>

In April 2003, after eighteen years as the general manager, Jerry Krause resigned due to what he described as minor health problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/us_sport/2926373.stm|title=Raptors pair sidelined|accessdate=2008-10-10|date=2003-04-07|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>  The following week, the Bulls hired [[John Paxson]] as his replacement.

==Accolades and service==

Reinsdorf has been involved (along with the likes of [[Playboy Enterprises]]' [[Christie Hefner]]) in Chicago Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]]'s initiative to improve [[standardized test]] scores in the 559 [[Chicago Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3585045.arc.htm|title=CLASS ACT: A REPORTER TURNS PRINCIPAL |accessdate=2008-10-07|date=1998-07-06|publisher=[[The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.]]|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|author=Dallas, Sandra}}</ref>  He has been involved in other extensive cheritable work including those of CharitaBulls and White Sox Charities.

Reinsdorf was inducted into the [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], [[Wisconsin]] Baseball Hall of Fame on August 5, 2006 in a ceremony at [[Fox Cities Stadium]] prior to that evening's game between the [[Midwest League]] [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers]] and [[Beloit Snappers]].  He was so recognized because a former Minor League club, the [[Appleton Foxes]], was a Chicago White Sox affiliate and won three consecutive Midwest League Championships in the early years of Reinsdorf's ownership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060725&content_id=110165&vkey=pr_milb&fext=.jsp|title=Reinsdorf to enter Appleton Hall of Fame: White Sox owner will be inducted on Aug. 5|accessdate=2008-10-07|publisher=[[Minor League Baseball]]|work=MiLB.com}}</ref>
