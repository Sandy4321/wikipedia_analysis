Acre is one of the oldest continuously inhabited sites in the country.

Historically, it was a strategic coastal link to the [[Levant]]. Acre is the holiest city of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]]. In 2009, the population was 46,300.<ref name="cbs populations">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2010/table3.pdf|publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|title=Table 3&nbsp;<U+2013> Population of Localities Numbering Above 2,000 Residents and Other Rural Population|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref> Acre is a mixed city, 72 percent Jewish and 28 percent Arab.

==Etymology==
The source of the name Akko is unknown. The Egyptians used it as long ago as the second millennium BC, but as it appears in the hieroglyphics as merely two consonants, its pronunciation is unknown.<ref name=acre.org>[http://www.acre.org.il/english/AboutFirm/History.asp]</ref>

In the [[Amarna letters]], written in Akkadian, the letter "H" is used to signify the guttural Hebrew letters alef-heh-chet-ayin, and therefore it was possible to write the name of the city as if it were "Haca" or "Aca". Had the name not been preserved, we would not have been able to identify it with certainty with the name that appears in hieroglyphics. In Assyrian the name has been preserved with the spelling "AKK".<ref name=acre.org/>

An ancient Hebrew legend tells that the sea flooded the world and when it reached the shore of Acre it stopped short, as is written in the Book of Job (38:11) <U+201C>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further.<U+201D> In the legend, the Hebrew words <U+201C>Ad po<U+201D> [Hitherto] become <U+201C>Ad ko,<U+201D> and, hence, Akko [Acre].<ref name=acre.org/>

The city was renamed Ptolemais during the Hellenistic and later Roman-Byzantine period, but was restored to "Akka" following the Muslim conquest.

It is later described in the territory of the tribe of [[Asher]] and according to [[Josephus]], was ruled by one of [[Solomon]]'s provincial governors. Throughout Israelite rule, it was politically and culturally affiliated with [[Phoenicia]]. Around 725 BC, Akko joined [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in a revolt against [[Shalmaneser V]].<ref>Becking Bob (1992) ''The Fall of Samaria: An Historical and Archaeological Study'' BRILL, ISBN 90-04-09633-7 pp 31<U+2013>35</ref>

===Greek, Judean and Roman periods===
Greek historians refer to the city as ''Ake'', meaning "cure." According to the Greek myth, [[Heracles]] found curative herbs here to heal his wounds.<ref>''The Guide to Israel'', [[Zev Vilnay]], Ahiever, Jerusalem, 1972, p. 396</ref> Josephus calls it ''Akre''. The name was changed to ''Antiochia Ptolemais'' shortly after [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, and then to Ptolemais, probably by [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemy Soter]], after the partition of the kingdom of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleplaces.com/acco.htm|title=Acco, Ptolemais, Acre|publisher=BiblePlaces.com|accessdate=October 20, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081120145413/http://www.bibleplaces.com/acco.htm| archivedate= 20 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Strabo]] refers to the city as once a rendezvous for the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] in their expeditions against [[Egypt]]. About 165 BC [[Judas Maccabeus]] defeated the Seleucids in several battles in [[Galilee]], and drove them into Ptolemais. About 153 BC [[Alexander Balas]], son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus Epiphanes]], contesting the Seleucid crown with [[Demetrius]], seized the city, which opened its gates to him. Demetrius offered many bribes to the [[Maccabees]] to obtain [[Jew]]ish support against his rival, including the revenues of Ptolemais for the benefit of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], but in vain. [[Jonathan Maccabaeus]] threw in his lot with Alexander, and in 150 BC he was received by him with great honour in Ptolemais. Some years later, however, Tryphon, an officer of the Seleucids, who had grown suspicious of the Maccabees, enticed Jonathan into Ptolemais and there treacherously took him prisoner.

The city was captured by [[Alexander Jannaeus]], [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] and [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II of Armenia]]. Here [[Herod the Great|Herod]] built a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], and here the Jews met Petronius, sent to set up statues of the emperor in the [[Temple]], and persuaded him to turn back. [[Saint Paul|St Paul]] spent a day in Ptolemais (Acts 21:7). A Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]] was established at the city, Colonia Claudii C<U+00E6>saris.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}<!-- Broken link <ref>Hazlit, W. (1851) [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0006.html The Classical Gazetteer] p4</ref> -->After the permanent division of [[Roman Empire|the Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, Akko was administered by the Eastern (later Byzantine) Empire.

===Arab and Crusader periods===
Following the defeat of the [[Byzantine army]] of [[Heraclius]] by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]] of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]], and the capitulation of the Christian city of Jerusalem to the Caliph [[Umar]], Acre came under the rule of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] beginning in 638. The Arab conquest brought a revival to the town of Acre, and it served as the main port of Palestine through the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s that followed, and through Crusader rule into the 13th century.<ref name=Petersenp68/> 

During the 10th-century, the city was a part of [[Jund al-Urdunn]] ("Military District of Jordan").<ref>le Strange, p.30.</ref> Local [[Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Acre during the Abbasid era in 985, describing it as a fortified coastal city with a large [[mosque]]. Fortifications had been built just previously by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun|Ibn Tulun]] of Egypt, who annexed the city in the 870s, and provided relative safety for merchant ships arriving at the city's port. When [[Persia]]n traveler [[Nasir Khusraw]] visited Acre in 1047, he noted that the large [[Friday mosque]] was built of [[marble]], located in the center of the city and just south of it lay the "tomb of the Prophet [[Salih]]."<ref>le Strange, pp.328-329.</ref> 

It was captured by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1104 in the [[First Crusade]] and the Crusaders also made the town their chief port in Palestine.<ref name="jewishmag1">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishmag.com/30MAG/acco/acco.htm |title=Archaeology in Israel&nbsp;<U+2013> Acco (Acre) |publisher=Jewishmag.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090606132333/http://www.jewishmag.com/30mag/acco/acco.htm| archivedate= 6 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Around 1170 it became the main port of the eastern Mediterranean, and the kingdom of Jerusalem was regarded in the west as enormously wealthy above all because of Acre.

But it was not captured until July 1191 by [[Richard I of England]], [[Philip II of France]], [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], the spearhead Swabian and German armies and the rest of the crusader's army. It then became the capital of the remnant of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1192. In 1229 it was placed under the control of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. The Crusaders called the city "Acre" or "Saint-Jean d'Acre" since they mistakenly identified it with the [[Philistines|Philistine]] city of [[Ekron]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, in northern [[Philistines|Philistia]], now southern Israel. 

It was the final stronghold of the Crusader state, and fell to the [[Mamluk|Mameluks]] of [[Egypt]] led by [[al-Ashraf Khalil]] in [[Siege of Acre (1291)|a bloody siege in 1291]].In 1321 [[Ayyubid]] geographer [[Abu'l Fida]] wrote that Acre was "a beautiful city" but still in ruins following its capture by the Mameluks. Nonetheless, the "spacious" port was still in use and the city was full of artisans.<ref>le Strange, p.333.</ref>

===Ottoman period===

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3981 acre.jpg|thumb|The [[Jezzar Pasha Mosque]]]]
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] under Sultan [[Selim I]] captured the city in 1517, after which it fell into almost total decay. English academic [[Henry Maundrell]] in 1697 found it a ruin, save for a khan ([[caravanserai]]) occupied by some French merchants, a [[mosque]] and a few poor cottages.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maundrell, Henry|year=1836|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LG09AAAAMAAJ&printsec=titlepage|title=A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem: At Easter, A.D. 1697|page=90|publisher=S. G. Simkins|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 18th century it revived under the rule of [[Dhaher al-Omar]], the local sheikh. His successor, [[Jezzar Pasha]], governor of [[Damascus]], improved and fortified it, but by heavy imposts secured for himself all the benefits derived from his improvements. About 1780 Jezzar peremptorily banished the French trading colony, in spite of protests from the French government, and refused to receive a consul.
[[File:Acco IMG 2951.JPG|thumb|Port of Acre]]
In 1799 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], in pursuance of his scheme for raising a Syrian rebellion against Turkish domination, appeared before Acre, but after a siege of two months (March<U+2013>May) was repulsed by the Turks, aided by Sir [[William Sidney Smith|Sidney Smith]] and a force of British sailors. Having lost his siege cannons to Smith, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] attempted to lay siege to the walled city defended by Ottoman troops on March 20, 1799, using only his infantry and small-calibre cannons, a strategy which failed, leading to his retreat two months later on May 21.

Jezzar was succeeded on his death by his son Suleiman Pasha, under whose milder rule the town advanced in prosperity till his death in 1819. After his death, [[Haim Farhi]], who was his adviser, paid a huge sum in bribes to assure that Abdullah Pasha (son of Ali Pasha, the deputy of Suleiman Pasha), whom he had known from youth, will be appointed as ruler. Abdullah Pasha ruled Acre until 1831, when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] besieged and reduced the town and destroyed its buildings. During the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]] it was bombarded on November 4, 1840 by the allied British, Austrian and French squadrons, and in the following year restored to Turkish rule. It regained some of former prosperity after linking with [[Hejaz Railway]] by a branch line from [[Haifa]] in 1913.<ref>http://www.historystudies.net/Makaleler/93679403_receb.pdf</ref> It was a sanjak centre ([[Sanjak of Acre]]) in [[Beirut Province, Ottoman Empire|Beyrut Eyalet]] until English occupation in 23 September 1918 during [[World War I]].

===British Mandate===
[[File:Akko BW 13.JPG|thumb|right|[[Khan al-Umdan]] in the old city of Acre]]
At the beginning of the Mandate period, in 1922, Acre had about 6,500 residents: 4,883 of whom Muslim, 1,344 Christian, 115 Baha<U+2019>i, and 78 Jewish.<ref name=rslissak>Rivka Spak Lissak. ''Acre Has Been Settled by Jews Alternately Since the 3rd Century BCE''. [http://rslissak.com/content/acre-has-been-settled-jews-alternately-3rd-century-bce-drrivka-spak-lissak]</ref> The British Mandate government reconstructed Acre and its economic situation improved. The 1931 Mandate census counted 7,897 people in Acre. In 1946 Acre<U+2019>s population numbered around 13,000.<ref name=rslissak/>

During the pogrom of 1929, Arabs, led by [[As'ad Shukeiri]], demolished the ancient synagogue in Acre<U+2019>s old city.<ref name=rslissak/> During the [[1936<U+2013>1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] in 1936<U+2013>1939, Acre<U+2019>s Arab residents were very active against the British and the Jewish settlements in Western Galilee.<ref name=rslissak/> This caused the Jews to leave Acre.

Acre<U+2019>s fort was converted into a jail, where members of the Jewish underground were held during their struggle against the British, among them [[Zeev Jabotinski]], Shlomo ben Yossef, and Dov Grunner. Grunner and ben Yossef were executed there. Other Jewish inmates were freed by members of the Irgun, who broke into the jail on May 4, 1947 and succeeded in releasing Jewish underground movement activists. Over 200 Arab inmates also escaped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Palestine/Acre.htm|title=Acre Jail Break|publisher=Britain's Small Wars|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref>

In the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 UN Partition Plan]], Acre was designated part of a future [[Arab world|Arab state]]. Before the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] broke out, Acre<U+2019>s Arabs attacked neighbouring Jewish settlements and Jewish transportation. On March 18, 1948, Arabs from Acre killed Jewish employees of the electricity company who were repairing the damaged lines near the city.

During the 1948 War, Acre was besieged by Israeli forces. A [[typhoid fever]] outbreak occurred in Acre at this time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Egypt claimed that the Haganah used [[typhus]] as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] against the inhabitants, though no evidence was forwarded in favour of the claim.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Brigadier Beveridge, chief of the British medical services, proclaimed at the time that "Nothing like that ever happened in Palestine". According to [[Ilan Papp<U+00E9>]], investigation by Beveridge, Colonel Bonnet of the [[British Army|British army]] and delegates of [[Red Cross (disambiguation)|the Red Cross]] concluded that the infection was caused by water-borne sources.<ref>Papp<U+00E9>, Ilan, The [[Ethnic cleansing|Ethnic Cleansing]] of Palestine (2007), p. 100</ref> Israel denies it has ever used biological weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio-typhoid.htm|title=Typhoid&nbsp;<U+2013> Biological Weapons|publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Israel/Biological/3652.html|title=Israel: Biological Chronology|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|accessdate=October 20, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081001014845/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Israel/Biological/3652.html| archivedate= 1 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===State of Israel===
[[File:Benami2.jpg|thumb|Ben-Ami Street]]
Acre was captured by Israel on May 17, 1948,<ref>[[Operation Ben-Ami]]</ref> displacing about three-quarters of the Arab population of the city (13,510 of 17,395).<ref name="karsh268"/> Throughout the 1950s many Jewish neighbourhoods were established at the northern and eastern parts of the city, as it became a [[development town]], designated to absorb numerous Jewish immigrants, largely [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jews from Morocco]]. The old city of Akko remained largely Arab Muslim (including several Bedouin families), with Arab Christian neighbourhood in close proximity. The city also attracted many Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> worshippers, some of whom became permanent residents in the city, where the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> [[Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>]] is located.

In the 1990s the city absorbed thousands of Jews, who immigrated from the Soviet Union and later from Russia and Ukraine. Within several years, however, the population balance between Jews and Arabs shifted backwards, as northern neighbourhoods were abandoned by many of its Jewish residents in favor of new housing projects in nearby Nahariya, while many Muslim Arabs moved in (largely coming from nearby Arab villages). Nevertheless, the city still has a clear Jewish majority (72 percent).
[[File:Akko Station.jpg|thumb|Acre Railway Station]]
Ethnic tensions erupted in the city on October 8, 2008 after an Arab citizen drove through a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood during [[Yom Kippur]], leading to five days of violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1028604.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=October 13, 2008|title=Peres in Acre: In Israel There Are Many Religions, But Only One Law|author=Khoury, Jack|accessdate=October 20, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081016051550/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1028604.html| archivedate= 16 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/world/middleeast/13mideast.html?bl&ex=1224043200&en=1694b9dd225b8c71&ei=5087%0A|publisher=[[The New York Times|New York Times]]|date=October 12, 2008|title=Israeli City Divided by Sectarian Violence|author=Kershner, Isabel|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017521503&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=October 12, 2008|title=Police Arrest Acre Yom Kippur driver|author=Izenberg, Dan|accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref>

==Education and culture==
The Sir Charles Clore Jewish-Arab Community Center in the Wolfson neighborhood runs youth clubs and programs for Jewish and Arab children. In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the  Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated out of two bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame [[Vivien Duffield]] of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered is Peace Child Israel, which employs theater and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution and then work together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the center runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5<U+2013>11. Some 1,000 children take part in the Acre Center's youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The center also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/social-action/ambassadors-for-peace-emerging-from-mixed-israeli-neighborhood Ambassadors for peace emerging from mixed Israeli neighborhood]</ref>

Acre's Old City has been designated by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. Since the 1990s, large-scale archeological excavations have been undertaken and efforts are being made to preserve ancient sites. In 2009, renovations were planned for Khan al-Omadan, the Inn of the Columns", the largest of several Ottoman inns still standing in Acre. It was built near the port at the end of the 18th century by [[Jezzar Pasha|Ahmed Pasha al-Jazzar]]. Merchants who arrived at the port would unload their wares on the first floor and sleep in lodgings on the second floor. In 1906, a clocktower was added over the main entrance marking the 25th anniversary of the reign of the Turkish sultan, [[<U+2018>Abdu<U+2019>l-Hamid II|Abdul Hamid II]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1061401.html Unearthing Acre's Ottoman roots]</ref>

===City walls===
[[File:Pizaniwall1.jpg|thumb|Acre sea wall]]
In 1750, [[Dhaher al-Omar|Daher El-Omar]], the ruler of Acre, utilized the remnants of the [[Crusades|Crusader]] walls as a foundation for his walls.  Two gates were set in the wall, the "land gate" in the eastern wall, and the "sea gate" in the southern wall. The walls were reinforced between 1775 and 1799 by [[Jezzar Pasha]] and survived [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s siege. The wall was thin: its height was 10 to 13 metres (33 to 43 feet) and its thickness only one metre (3&nbsp;ft). A heavy land [[Defensive wall|defense wall]] was built north and east to the city in 1800<U+2013>1814 by [[Jezzar Pasha]] and his Jewish advisor [[Haim Farhi]]. It consists of a modern counter artillery [[fortification]] which includes a thick [[defensive wall]], a dry [[moat]], [[cannon]] outposts and three ''burges'' (large defensive towers). Since then, no major modifications have taken place. The sea wall, which remains mostly complete, is the original El-Omar's wall that was reinforced by Jezzar Pasha. In 1910 two additional gates were set in the walls, one in the northern wall and one in the north-western corner of the city. In 1912 the [[Akko Light|Acre lighthouse]] was built on the south-western corner of the walls.

===Jezzar Pasha Mosque===
The [[Jezzar Pasha Mosque|Mosque of Jezzar Pasha]] was built in 1781. [[Jezzar Pasha]] and his successor [[Suleiman Pasha]], are both buried in a small graveyard adjacent to the mosque. In a shrine on the second level of the mosque, a single hair from the prophet Mohammed's beard is kept and shown on special ceremonial occasions.

===Citadel of Acre===
The current building which constitutes the citadel of Acre is an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fortification, built on the foundation of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallerian]] citadel. The citadel was part of the city's defensive formation, reinforcing the northern wall. During the 20th century the [[citadel]] was used mainly as a [[prison]] and as the site for a [[gallows]]. During the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British mandate]] period, activists of Jewish Zionist [[resistance movement]]s were held prisoner there; some were executed there.

===Hamam al-Basha===
Built in 1795 by Jezzar Pasha, Acre's [[Turkish bath|hammam]] has a series of hot rooms and a hexagonal steam room with a marble fountain. It was used by the [[Irgun]] as a bridge to break into the citadel's prison. The bathhouse kept functioning until 1950.

===Knights' Halls===
[[File:Akko-Citadel.jpg|thumb|Knights Halls]]
Under the citadel and prison of Acre, archaeological excavations revealed a complex of halls, which was built and used by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers Knights]].<ref name="jewishmag1"/> This complex was a part of the Hospitallers' citadel, which was combined in the northern wall of Acre. The complex includes six semi-joined halls, one recently excavated large hall, a dungeon, a [[dining room]] and remains of an ancient [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church. [[Medieval European]] remains include the Church of [[Saint George]] and adjacent houses at the Genovese Square (called Kikar ha-Genovezim or Kikar Genoa in Hebrew). There were also residential quarters and marketplaces run by merchants from [[Pisa]] and [[Amalfi]] in [[Crusades|Crusader]] and medieval Acre.

===Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> holy places===
[[File:Bahji.jpg|thumb|Bahai shrine in Acre, Bahji mansion]]
There are many [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>]] holy places in and around Acre. They originate from [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]'s imprisonment in the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre buildings#Prison cell of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h|Citadel]] during Ottoman Rule. The final years of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's life were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>]], just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h died on May 29, 1892 in Bahj<U+00ED>, and his [[Shrine of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h|shrine]] is the [[Most Holy Place|most holy place]] for Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s&nbsp;<U+2014> their [[Qiblih]], the location they face when saying their daily prayers. It contains the remains of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>. Other Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> sites in Acre are the [[House of `Abb<U+00FA>d]] (where Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and his family resided) and the [[House of `Abdu'll<U+00E1>h P<U+00E1>sh<U+00E1>]] (where later 'Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> resided with his family), and the [[Garden of Ridv<U+00E1>n, Akk<U+00E1>|Garden of Ridv<U+00E1>n]] where he spent the end of his life. In 2008, the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre buildings|Bahai holy places]] in Acre and [[Haifa]] were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bwns.org/story/642|title=Baha'i Shrines Chosen as World Heritage sites|publisher=Baha'i World News Service|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=October 20, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081120022441/http://bwns.org/story/642| archivedate= 20 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1000944.html|title=Israeli Baha'i Sites Recognized by UNESCO|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|author=Glass, Hannah|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=October 20, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080922091911/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1000944.html| archivedate= 22 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Sports==
The city's [[football team]] [[Hapoel Acre F.C.|Hapoel Acre]] is a member of [[Liga Leumit]], the second tier of [[Football in Israel|Israeli football]], after a brief stint in the [[Israeli Premier League|Ligat ha'Al]] top division during the 1970s.
At the end of the 2008/9 season [[Hapoel Acre F.C.|Hapoel Acre]] finished in the top five and so was promoted to the [[Israeli Premier League|Ligat ha'Al]] for a second time, after an absence of 31 years. A new football stadium is under construction at the southern approaches to the city and it is hoped that it will open during the 2011/2012 season and will seat 5000 spectators.

==Transportation==
The Acre central [[bus station]], served by [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]], offers city and inter-city bus routes to destinations all over Israel. The city is also served by the [[Acre Railway Station]].
