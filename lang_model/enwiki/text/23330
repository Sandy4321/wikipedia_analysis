"'''Harlem Shake'''" is a song recorded by American DJ and producer [[Baauer]]. It was released as a free [[music download|digital download]] by [[Mad Decent]] imprint label Jeffree's on May 22, 2012. The song incorporates an undulating synth, harsh [[snare drum|snares]], a mechanical [[bassline]], and [[sampling (music)|samples]] of growling-lion sounds. It also samples [[Plastic Little (band)|Plastic Little]]'s 2001 song "Miller Time", specifically the vocal "then do the Harlem shake", which is an allusion to [[Harlem shake (dance)|dance of the same name]]. Baauer added a variety of peculiar sounds to the song so that it would stand out.

In February 2013, a [[YouTube]] video set to "Harlem Shake" developed into an [[internet meme]] of [[Harlem Shake (meme)|the same name]]. The media response to the meme helped increase the single's sales, as it reached number one on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Dance/Electronic Songs]]. It also charted at number three on the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK Singles]] charts. "Harlem Shake" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]], who viewed it as an appealing dance song, although some felt that it was more of a [[novelty song]]. American rapper [[Azealia Banks]] released a remix to the song on her [[SoundCloud]] page, which was subsequently removed at Baauer's request and led to a dispute between the two.

"Harlem Shake" features a sample of a woman yelling "con los terroristas", which translates to "with the terrorists".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shellnutt|first=Kate|date=February 20, 2013|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2013/february/problem-with-christians-doing-harlem-shake.html|title=The Problem with Christians Doing the 'Harlem Shake'|journal=[[Christianity Today]]|location=Carol Stream|accessdate=February 20, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EaODYlTj|archivedate=February 20, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> It was taken from an [[a capella]] version of DJ duo Philadelphyinz's 2010 remix for the song "Con Alegria", recorded by Gregor Salto, [[DJ Solo]], and DJ Gregory.<ref name="Zeichner"/> "Harlem Shake" also samples the line "then do the Harlem shake" from hip hop group [[Plastic Little (band)|Plastic Little]]'s 2001 song "Miller Time".<ref name="Zeichner"/> Baauer used the vocal sample after a friend had played him the song, which he said "got stuck in my head for a while".<ref name="Stern"/> Plastic Little member [[Jayson Musson]] said that his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the [[harlem shake (dance)|harlem shake]].

== Commercial performance ==
{{see also|Harlem Shake (meme)}}

"Harlem Shake" was released commercially in June 2012,<ref name="Trust">{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549388/baauers-harlem-shake-debuts-atop-revamped-hot-100 |title=Baauer's 'Harlem Shake' Debuts Atop Revamped Hot 100 |last=Trust |first=Gary |date=February 20, 2013|location=New York |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=February 20, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EaNwfjuO|archivedate=February 20, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> and then to the [[iTunes Store]] on January 8, 2013.<ref name="iTunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/harlem-shake-single/id601136812|title=Harlem Shake - Single|publisher=[[iTunes Store|iTunes]]. [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXjyyd9Q|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> However, it did not begin to sell until February,<ref name="Trust"/> when the song's music was set to a [[YouTube]] video that developed into an [[Internet meme]] of [[Harlem Shake (meme)|the same name]]. The 30-second video featured people dancing to the song and was parodied more than 3,000 times in other user-submitted videos.<ref name="Hampp"/> 

The late-week media response to the meme helped the single sell 12,000 units on iTunes in the week ending February 10, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]. It consequently entered the US [[Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]] at number nine and the [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] at number twelve.<ref name="Hampp"/> Mad Decent's manager Jasper Goggins said that "Harlem Shake" was the "biggest thing" they have released, "and it's happened within six days."<ref name="Hampp">{{cite journal|last=Hampp|first=Andrew|date=February 15, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1539277/harlem-shake-the-making-and-monetizing-of-baauers-viral-hit|title='Harlem Shake': The Making and Monetizing of Baauer's Viral Hit|journal=Billboard|accessdate=February 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXk1ZYx0|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> The following week, "Harlem Shake" debuted at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and climbed to number one on the Dance/Electronic Songs, while selling 262,000 units. It was the twenty-first song in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one and was aided by 103 million weekly [[streaming media|streams]], which was announced that week by ''Billboard'' and Nielsen SoundScan as a new component of their charts. However, because it lacked [[major label]] promotional support, the single registered low in airplay.<ref name="Trust"/>

In the United Kingdom, "Harlem Shake" reached number twenty-two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the week during the meme's phenomena. Its popularity helped the single climb 19 spots to number three on the chart. Martin Talbot, the [[Official Charts Company]]'s managing director, said that the single's climb on the chart "underlines just how quickly this track has turned into a bone fide phenomenon. At the start of the week, it wasn't even selling enough to make the Top 20 - but it is now one of the UK's most popular tracks."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreisler|first=Lauren|date=February 17, 2013|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/harlem-shake-fires-into-top-3-1862/|title=Harlem Shake fires into Top 3|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXk5hGDr|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
[[Pitchfork Media]]'s Larry Fitzmaurice labelled the song "Best New Track" upon its release in May 2012 and called it a "disorienting banger" with an "irresistible appeal" that "owes almost everything" to its "menacing, world-smashing bassline". Fitzmaurice wrote in conclusion, "Along with this purely visceral pleasure, it's hard not to marvel at how awesome those growling-lion samples sound."<ref name="Fitzmaurice"/> Anthony Fantano of [[The Needle Drop]] complimented its "monstrous hits of bass, detailed trap-style hi-hats, and an infectiously unique synth riff," and commented that if the song "isn't a perfect banger, it's pretty damn close."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theneedledrop.com/2013/02/baauer-harlem-shake/|title=Baauer <U+2013> <U+201C>Harlem Shake<U+201D>|publisher=[[The Needle Drop]]|accessdate=February 18, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXk9pUmw|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> 

Andrew Ryce of [[Resident Advisor]] gave the song a rating of three-and-a-half out of five and found its musical climax "admittedly satisfying<U+2014>that is, until it resumes flailing like a [[novelty song|novelty track]]", writing that "it's not hard to see why the track is well-liked, but its snowballing ubiquity is a bit of a head-scratcher, simply because it's not all that interesting."<ref name="Ryce"/> Similarly, Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that, after hearing a minute of it being played on radio station [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1 FM]] during a [[DJ mix|mixshow]], the song "felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy." Caramanica felt that the song's success reflects a "centerless future" for hip hop and stated, "Depending on your lens, this reflects a tremendous cultural victory for hip-hop or the moment when hip-hop, as a [[Social constructionism|construct]], begins to lose meaning."<ref name="Caramanica"/>

== Remix ==
On February 14, American rapper [[Azealia Banks]] released a [[remix]] to "Harlem Shake" on [[SoundCloud]],<ref name="Zoladz">{{cite web|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsay|date=February 15, 2013|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/49582-baauer-gets-azealia-banks-harlem-shake-taken-down-feels-her-twitter-wrath/|title=Baauer Gets Azealia Banks' "Harlem Shake" Taken Down, Feels Her Twitter Wrath|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=February 18, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXkDIyVY|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> which was then removed at Baauer's request. Banks disparaged Baauer on [[Twitter]] in response and claimed to have e-mails sent from him giving her permission to use the song. She then said that producer [[Diplo]] had sent her an e-mail telling her that the remix was removed because they would rather have rapper [[Juicy J]] on it.<ref name="Battan"/> On February 16, Banks shared a [[music video]] for her remix on [[Vimeo]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=February 16, 2013|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/49587-azealia-banks-shares-her-harlem-shake-video/|title=Azealia Banks Shares Her "Harlem Shake" Video, Claims She Got Baauer's Permission to Use Track|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=February 18, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EXkH7Bco|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> and revealed a purported e-mail from Baauer saying he liked the remix.<ref name="Caramanica"/> Baauer responded in an interview for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', saying that they had planned to release a version of the song with Banks, but felt that her verse did not meet their expectations: 

{{quote|She laid something on 'Harlem Shake' and it was so/so. Didn't love it. And that was a little while ago, and since all this video stuff happened, our plans all changed. Because of that, we decided to just release the song on its own with no vocal version. So we told her, 'Please don't release your version.' And she said, 'Well, I'm going to put it online anyway.' And we said, 'Please don't. We'd really like it if you didn't.'
