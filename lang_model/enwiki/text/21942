The '''Yarra River''', also known as '''Birrarung''', is a [[river]] in southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The lower stretches of the river is where the city of [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] was established in [[1835]] and today [[Greater Melbourne]] dominates and influences the landscape of its lower reaches. From its source in the [[Yarra Ranges]], it flows 242km west through the [[Yarra Valley]] which opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne before emptying into [[Hobsons Bay]] in northernmost [[Port Phillip]]. The river was a major food source and meeting place for the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Wurundjeri]] people until actions by early European settlers such as land clearing in the mid 1800's, forced the Wurundjeri people in neighbouring territories, away from the river.

Originally called ''Birrarung'' by the [[Wurundjeri]] people, the current name was mistranslated from another Wurundjeri term; ''Yarra Yarra''. After European settlement, throughout the [[Victorian gold rush]], it was mined for [[gold]] and in many places its course was modified or disrupted, such as the Pound Bend Tunnel in [[Warrandyte]] and Coode Island excavations in [[West Melbourne]], which ultimately led to the destruction of the marshlands at the confluence of the Yarra and [[Maribyrnong River|Maribyrnong]] Rivers.

Today, the mouth and lower reaches of the river including Swanston and Appleton Docks are used for [[container shipping]] by the [[Port of Melbourne]], the busiest on the continent. To a lesser extent they are used for transport, both for [[recreational boating]] and [[passenger ferry|ferries]].  The city reach which is inaccessible to larger watercraft has seen growing use for both transport and recreational use (including [[kayaking]], [[canoeing]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[swimming]]) in recent years however recreational use of the river is threatened by high levels of pollution in its lower stretches. The upper reaches remain a relatively healthy ecosystem. Prior to European settlement, the river relied on regular flooding to replenish silts and soils on its banks, however this threatened settlements along the river and [[Melbourne]] itself and the Upper Yarra Dam was subsequently constructed. The [[Moomba]] festival is held on the banks of the river each year.

==Etymology==
The river was called ''Birrarung'' by the [[Wurundjeri]] people who occupied the [[Yarra Valley]] and much of [[Central Victoria]] prior to European settlement. It is thought that ''Birrarung'' is derived from Wurundjeri words meaning "ever flowing". Another common term was ''Birrarung Marr'', thought to mean "river of mist" or "river bank". Upon European arrival it was given the name ''Yarra Yarra'' by [[John Helder Wedge]] of the [[Port Phillip Association]] in 1835, in the mistaken belief that this was the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] name for the river, however it is believed that ''Yarra'' means "waterfall" or "flow", descriptive of any river or creek in the area, not just the Yarra. Of their contact with local Wurunderi people in 1835, John Wedge wrote:

:''On arriving in sight of the river, the two natives who were with me pointed to the river, and called out at it "Yarra", "Yarra", which at the time I imagined to be its name. But I afterwards learnt that the words were what they used to designate a waterfall, as they gave the same designation to a small fall in the Werribee River, as we crossed it on our way back to [[Indented Head, Victoria|Indented Head]].'' - [[John Helder Wedge]]

==Geology & Formation==
[[Image:Port Phillip 10,000.PNG|250px|thumb|The course of the Yarra River around 10,000 years ago, after the end of the last [[Ice Age]], prior to the creation of [[Port Phillip]].]]
The Yarra River has a detailed and complex geological history. During the last major [[Ice Age]], sea levels were much lower and the Yarra flowed in a small canyon through Greater Melbourne some 30 to 40 metres deep. Temperatures were colder, rainfall was higher and the steep banks of todays "Yarra Valley" in the centre of Melbourne were a [[temperate rainforest]]. This old Yarra Valley flowed out into [[Port Phillip]], which at the time was a dry plain with the Yarra River flowing southwards towards [[Geography of Port Phillip|Capel Sound]].

Through the Port Phillip plains it was swelled along the way by tributaries such as the Maribyrnong, Werribee and Barwon Rivers. The river probably banked up into a lake in the lower reaches of the plain, constricted in its flow by the narrow gap created by [[The Rip|The Heads]]. From here it poured out into [[Bass Strait]], perhaps as a waterfall. As the water levels rose, the Port Phillip Plain disappeared under water and the water levels of the rivers rose until they meandered across the top of the river valleys that subsequently filled with silt.

In 1928, an 8,000 year old [[Red Gum]] stump was excavated during the construction of the [[Spencer Street Bridge]]. The tree, which was estimated to have been up to 400 years old, would have grown in the old Yarra Valley before becomming burried in silt at the time of rising water levels, encased in the riverbed until its excavation in 1928.

{{main|History of the Yarra River}}

The area surrounding the Yarra River and modern day [[Melbourne]] was originally inhabited by various clans of the [[Wurundjeri]] people of the [[Kulin]] nation. It is believed that the area was occupied by [[indigenous Australians]] for at least 30,000 years. The river was an important resource for the Wurundjeri people and several sites along the river and its tributaries were important meeting places where ''corroborees'' were held between indigenous communities. The river's resources were utilised [[sustainability|sustainably]] by the [[Wurundjeri]] until the advent of early European settlement in the early-mid 1800's.

===European Discovery and Settlement===
In [[1803]], the first Europeans sailed up the river, a surveying party led by [[Charles Grimes]], Acting [[Surveyor]] General of [[New South Wales]], sailed upstream to [[Dights Falls]] where they could no longer continue due to the nature of the terrain. European explorers would not enter the river for another 30 years until, in [[1835]], the area that is now central and northern Melbourne was explored by [[John Batman]], a leading member of the [[Port Phillip Association]], who negotiated a transaction for 600,000 acres (2,400 km<U+00B2>) of land from eight [[Wurundjeri]] elders. He selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that "this will be the place for a village".

The river was instrumental in the establishment of [[Melbourne]] along its banks from 1835 onwards. The new settlement's main port was sited near Queensbridge, the place where [[saltwater]] met [[freshwater]]. Ships would use one side of the falls while the other side provided fresh drinking water for the town and a convenient sewer. In the city's early days the Yarra was one of two major ports, the other being Sandridge or [[Port Melbourne]], but the Yarra was preferred due to the direct access to the town's main streets and was the location of [[Customs House, Melbourne|Customs House]].  Early industries grew along the banks of the river, rapidly degrading the water quality until [[Melbourne]]'s fresh water had to be sourced from elsewhere. Industries then began using the river and tributaries such as [[Merri Creek]] as landfill and for harmful chemical dumps for substances like grease and oils.

The first permanent crossing over the river was [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], which first opened as a wooden [[trestle bridge]] in 1844, the current bridge was constructed in 1888. In the early days, the river would frequently flood. While this was not considered a problem in the floodplains near [[Yarra Glen]] and [[Coldstream]], however it caused much trouble further downstream in settlements such as [[Warrandyte]], [[Templestowe]], [[Bulleen]], [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] and [[Ivanhoe, Victoria|Ivanhoe]]. The Upper Yarra Dam was later constructed to alleviate the flooding, protecting settlements along the river, yet depriving the river banks of soil and silt deposits and causing other problems such as [[erosion]] and [[salinity]].

===The Victorian Gold Rush===
[[Gold]] was first discovered in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] near the Yarra River in [[Warrandyte]]. The find was made by Louis Michel in 1851 at a tributary of the river, Anderson's Creek and marked the start of the [[Victorian gold rush]]. The approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill in the Warrandyte State Park. The river was drained and diverted in various areas throughout the gold rush to aid gold miners. An example of this is the tunnel at Pound Bend in [[Warrandyte]]. The river was partially dammed at Pound Bend near Normans Reserve at its eastern entrance and near Bob's wetlands at its western exit. Miners then blasted a 300m long tunnel through solid rock. The river was then fully dammed at the entrance and exit to the tunnel and water was diverted through 300m and out the other side leaving an astonishing 3.85km of riverbed around Pound Bend exposed to the sun and the miners picks.

The Gold Rush saw increased development in Melbourne and "tent cities" of new migrants lined the Yarra during the early years of the gold rush. In the 1840's a wier was built at [[Dights Falls]] to power a flour mill and to give some control over the river downstream from there. From the earliest years of settlment, the mid and upper reaches of the Yarra began to be used for recreation. The river was selected as the site for the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in 1846 and the course of the river was modified slightly for the creation of a feature lake. Further upstream, the [[Cremorne Gardens, Melbourne|Cremorne Gardens]] were established in 1853.  

===Industrialisation===
[[Image:After 1892.PNG|250px|thumb|The creation of [[Coode Island, Victoria|Coode Island]] after the 1880-1892 construction works.]]
Sections of the river mouth and the area around the former West Melbourne Swamp were widened in the late 1800's, to make way for docks, harbours, bridges and other infrastructure. The increasing industrialisation of the river and the growth of the shipping industry saw the need for major infrastructure works which dramatically changed the course of the river in it's lower reaches. The creation of new shipping channels to cope with the growing use of the Yarra by cargo ships was first tabled in the 1870s.

The first major change game with the cutting of the "Fisherman's Bend" channel between [[1880]] and [[1886]]. This major infrastructure project created an island which was known as [[Coode Island, Victoria|Coode Island]], named after the engineer in charge of the excavation and dock construction works, Sir [[John Coode (engineer)|John Coode]]. This also included widening and deepening, and in some cases, vast areas of land were excavated, such as [[Melbourne Docklands|Victoria Dock]], in order to give ease of access for cargo and container ships. [[abbatoir|Abbitoir]]s, [[smelters]] and even [[mortuary|mortuaries]] were to use the river as a means of waste disposal in it's lower reaches. This industrialisation also led to a steady deterioration in water quality during the 19th century and into the 20th. In 1891, the great flood caused the Yarra to swell to {{convert|305|m|ft|}} in width.

Initially known as "West Melbourne Dock", over 3 million cubic yards of material was excavated and a new dock was eventually opened in [[1892]], the material that was removed was subsequently used to fill in part of the West Melbourne Swamp, it took 6 days for water from the Yarra River to fill the dock. The dock was later renamed Victoria Dock. In 1910, the main channel was widened and deepened (81m to 131m). In 1916, the central pier at Victoria Dock was completed which provided 6 additional shipping berths and cargo sheds and creating a distinctive landmark for Melbourne ports. By 1942, 650m of the old course of the Yarra River at Coode Island had been filled in, by the 1950's it had been completley filled and land parcels were allocated including a site for the new Fish Markets.

In 1957, the [[Upper Yarra Reservoir]] was constructed, primarily to alleviate flooding downstream. Swanson Dock was constructed between 1966 and 1972 equipped for modern container shipping. Shipping activity at Victoria Dock during this time had gone into steep decline and it was almost disused by the mid 1970s. In February 1972, the CBD was flooded as the natural watercourse of Elizabeth Street became a raging torrent.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-07-18
}}</ref> This was due mostly to previous storm water drainage works which utilised Elizabeth street as a watercourse during times of intense rain creating flash floods. Prior to settlements, the area now occupied by Elizabeth street was a gully off the river.

===Recent History===
[[Image:Since 1972.PNG|250px|thumb|The area around [[Port Melbourne]] since the construction of Swanson Dock in 1972.]]
By the 1960s there was a growing awareness of the neglect of the Yarra amongst some residents of [[Melbourne]], spawning various community groups and "friends of..." organisations to protect the remnants of the river's ecology. Through the 1970's and 80's, many desirable developments alongside the river began, such as the [[Victorian Arts Centre]], as it's lower courses progressively became gentrified. Growing high density residential development in the lower reaches in the early 1990s coincided with minor government programs such as the installation of litter traps. The riverside apartment complex Como Centre at [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] and the larger urban renewal of the formerly industrial [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] precinct were both built during the late 90's.

Around 2000, the river became a focus of major government projects. Projects were proposed to connect Flinders Street Station with the river and early proposals for the [[Melbourne Museum]] were situated along the south side of the river, however the [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex]] and [[Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre]] were built in its place. The [[Melbourne Docklands]] urban renewal project began in 2000, comprising mixed use residential and commercial land and recreational boating moors along the river at the disused Victoria Docks and also on the southside of the Yarra. [[Federation Square]] was proposed to connect the spine of Melbourne to the Yarra at Federation Wharf and a neighbouring park, [[Birrarung Marr, Melbourne|Birrarung Marr]] was also built along the banks. Some suggest this connection between the City and the river could have been made better and many feel that Federation Square was rushed and neglects the river that it sits next to. New ferry services and water taxis sprang up along the city reach, servicing as far up river as South Yarra and as far down river as Williamstown. 

In 2008, dredging began to deepen the mouth of the Yarra to facilitate the latest [[supertanker]] ships.  It was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that it could disturb [[heavy metals]] and other toxic sediments mostly deposited during the industrial era of Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web

==Pollution and Environmental Issues==
The Yarra River was an important resource for the [[Wurundjeri]] people for around 40,000 years. The river's resources were utilised [[sustainability|sustainably]] by the Wurundjeri until the advent of early European settlement in the early-mid 1800's. Early industry located along the river contributed great amounts of pollution such as dangerous chemicals, grease, oil and heavy metals. Through the mid 20th century, industry was slowly relocated away from the river and since then the major pollutants have come from storm water runoff, sewerage and lasting effects of previous pollution. Gold mining cleared small areas of land of vegetation and for periods of time, drained sections of the river, however when compared to land clearing and industrial pollutants, the effects of gold mining on the river were quite low.

The lasting effects of pollution in the river can be seen in the lack of vegetation along the river at various locations, particularly downstream of Southbank, where there is no native vegetation at all. Heavy metals deposited into the river throughout the late 1800's and early 1900's settled to the bottom of the river bed, particularly in the lower reaches through the city and Port Melbourne, and due to the increased artificial depth of the river through here, heavy metals have not been carried further, although some have been deposited out into [[Port Phillip]]. Oils and grease remain today in several tributaries in the lower reaches such as [[Merri Creek]] and Moonee Ponds Creek.

===Pollution===
Levels of bacteria, particularly [[E-coli]] and substances like grease, oils and heavy metals in the Yarra River and its tributaries are a major problem. High levels of E-coli, some up to 200 times the safe limit in its tributaries, are caused primarily by poorly maintained septic systems.<ref>{{cite web

===Lack of Flooding===
Due to damming and the lack of natural flooding, much of the surrounding vegetation is lacking in the silt and soil deposits that would otherwise be provided by the floods. This has led to a lack of healthy understory and saplings, or a lack of saplings completely, which contributes to problems such as reduced habitat, [[erosion]] and [[salinity]].

===Colour===
The muddy brown colour of the Yarra is caused by the easily eroded clay soils of its catchment area. The water was clear at the time of the first European settlements, but intensive land clearing and development since the mid 1800s has resulted in the presence of microscopic clay particles. The particles are kept suspended by the turbulence in some parts of the middle and lower sections of the river. When the river water combines with marine salts as it enters Port Phillip, the suspended particles clump together and sink. The presence of clay particles is not a major factor in the pollution of the river.

==Geography==
[[Image:Yarramap.png|250px|thumb|Map of Yarra River and its tributaries.]]
{{main|Geography of the Yarra River}}

The Yarra River has a detailed and complex geological history, see "Geology". It was utilised and managed [[sustainability|sustainably]] by the [[Wurundjeri]] for around 40,000 years, however since the European settlement and use of the river in the mid 1800's, it's geography has changed substantially reflecting the [[sustainability|unsustainable]] use of the river and surrounding resources. The river is fed by a number of small unnamed creeks and streams in the [[Yarra Ranges]] as well as 49 named tributaries, most of which are [[creeks]]. The river's lower reaches travel through central [[Melbourne]]. It is approximately {{convert|242|km|mi|}} in length, with a mean annual flow of {{convert|718000|ML|impgal U.S.gal|lk=on}}. It is the most westerly snow fed river in Australia. The total catchment area is approximately {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|}}.

===Tributaries and geographic features===
The Yarra's major [[tributaries]] are the [[Maribyrnong River]], [[Moonee Ponds Creek]], [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]], [[Plenty River]] and the [[Mullum Mullum Creek]]. The river hosts many geographical features such as; bends, [[rapid]]s, [[lake]]s, [[island]]s, [[floodplain]]s, [[billabong]]s and [[wetland]]s. Most features have been named after translated [[Wurundjeri]] phrases or have European, particularly [[Great Britain|British]], origins. Some of the river's more prominent features include; [[Coode Island, Victoria|Coode Island]] and Fishermans Bend, [[Victoria Harbour]], [[Herring Island (Victoria)|Herring Island]], [[Yarra Bend]], Dights Falls, Upper Yarra Dam and Reservoir and many river flats and billabongs.

==Course==
===Upper reaches===
The river's source is a series of [[swamp]]s in the upper reaches of the [[Yarra Ranges National Park]], directly to the west of the [[Mt Baw Baw]] plateau, a thickly forested subalpine park, which is entirely closed-off to all except the employees of [[Melbourne Water]]. The park features extensive stands of [[Eucalyptus regnans|mountain ash]], a very tall [[eucalypt]], [[tree fern]]s, as well as patches of remnant rainforest.

The [[Upper Yarra Dam]], one of a number of dams in the Yarra Catchment that supply a large part of [[Melbourne]]'s water, is the furthest upstream point on the river visible to the general public (though the dam itself is closed off). The first settlement the still-young river passes through is the small town of Reefton, but most of the river is surrounded by hills covered temperate forest until the timber and resort town of [[Warburton, Victoria|Warburton]]. The [[Woods Point, Victoria|Woods Point Rd]] follows the river through this section.

Downstream of Warburton, the Yarra Valley gradually opens out and farms begin to appear, including beef and dairy farms, and by the town of [[Woori Yallock, Victoria|Woori Yallock]] and the river's turn north, increasingly large areas are covered by vineyards, forming the [[Yarra Valley]] wine region. At [[Healesville, Victoria|Healesville]], the river turns west again and the stream bed becomes increasingly silty, reducing the clarity of the water, and by the commuter town of [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] it begins to take on the brownish colour that the lower reaches are known for.

===Middle reaches===
The river enters Melbourne's suburbs proper at [[Chirnside Park]], but virtually all the river's length is surrounded by parkland, much retaining (or having been replanted with) extensive native vegetation. A [[bicycle]] and walking trail known as the Main Yarra Trail begins at [[Warrandyte, Victoria|Warrandyte]] and becomes the [[Yarra River Trail]], and in the lower reaches, the [[Capital City Trail]]. The river is used extensively for kayaking at [[Templestowe, Victoria|Templestowe]], and canoes can often be seen throughout the suburban section. Whilst the water is not particularly clear, its quality is sufficient for edible fish to swim within it. Some small hobby farms are located in the floodplain area of the river, surprisingly close to central Melbourne and almost completely surrounded by suburbs.

Heidelberg formed the home of the [[Heidelberg School]], widely considered the first European painters to accurately capture the Australian landscape and its distinctive features. The walking trail features placards displaying some of their paintings at the settings they were actually painted; some features depicted remain clearly recognisable today.

===Lower reaches===
[[Image:Melbourne yarra twilight.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the Yarra River as it flows through Central Melbourne at night, with the central business district on the left and [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] on the right]]

Below [[Dights Falls]] at [[Yarra Bend Park]] in inner Melbourne, the river becomes increasingly estuarine as it passes along the southern side of the central business district. This area forms the venue for the annual "[[Moomba]]" festival, which notably features an annual [[water skiing]] competition which attracts a huge crowd. The lower stretch of the river from [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] was part of the final path of the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. Many of Melbourne's private schools, located close to the river, train their [[Sport rowing|rowing]] crews on it.

The lower reaches feature a number of boat cruises, using especially low-roof boats to go under the many bridges across this section of the Yarra. [[Herring Island (Victoria)|Herring Island]] is a small island at South Yarra which has a punt which takes people on to the park. The area in front of old [[Customs House, Melbourne]] is a former turning basin for ships. It is the point which was once known as "Freshwater Place" and once had a set of cascades which prevented both salt water and larger ships from going further upstream. This series of rocks, originally used to cross the river, and referred to as the "Yarra Falls" was removed using explosives and divers in [[1883]].

The final section passes through the [[Port of Melbourne]] and under the [[Bolte Bridge]] and the [[West Gate Bridge]]. The current course dates back to 1886 when a canal devised by British engineer Sir [[John Coode (engineer)|John Coode]] was cut from west of Flinders Street to below its junction with the Maribyrnong.<ref>{{cite web

The river flows into [[Port Phillip|Port Phillip Bay]], the site being extensively altered as part of the Port of Melbourne, Australia's busiest [[seaport]].

==Crossings==
[[Image:Punt crossing of yarra.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Yarra crossing, Punt Road. by W. Liardet,1840]]
{{main|Crossings of the Yarra River}}

Since the first permanent crossing was built over the river in 1844, there are now over 60 places where pedestrians, cars and other vehicles can cross the river.  As the the river is never wider than around 350m and is on average only around 50m wide, most of the crossings are located in the suburbs of [[Greater Melbourne]].  While there are fewer crossings towards the mouth of the river, most notably the [[West Gate Bridge|West Gate]], [[Bolte Bridge|Bolte]] and [[Princes Bridge (Melbourne)|Princes]] Bridges, and the [[Burnley Tunnel|Burnley]] and [[Domain Tunnel|Domain]] Tunnels.  Small historical bridges can be found further downstream including the the Banksia Street, Fitzsimons Lane and [[Warrandyte]] Bridges. Beyond [[Warburton]] there are very few crossings available. Some of the more prominent and historical crossings include;<ref>[[Melway]] Edition 36, 2009</ref>

{{main|Parklands adjoining the Yarra River}}

Several reserves have been set aside adjoining the Yarra, mostly to preserve the natural environment or for recreation, many of these are managed and operated by [[Parks Victoria]], the state government agency responsible for the management of Victoria's national parks and other reserves. The most largest and most notable of these parklands include: the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne|Royal Botanic Gardens]], [[Birrarung Marr]], [[Yarra Bend Park]], [[Westerfolds Park]], Warrandyte State Park and the [[Yarra Ranges National Park]]. <ref>[[Melway]] Edition 36, 2009</ref>

* [[Yarra Ranges National Park]]

===Golf Courses===
There are 14 [[golf course]]s adjoining the river, these include, from downstream to upstream:

==Recreational use==
[[Image:Yarra River and Fish Boats.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Artificial fish on the Yarra during [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]]]

Throughout its length, the waters of the Yarra River and its banks are used for; [[boating]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[water skiing]], [[kayaking]], [[canoeing]], [[swimming]], [[fishing]], [[cycling]], [[running]] and [[walking]], amongst other things. In the rivers upper reaches, [[fishing]] is most popular. Upstream of [[Launching Place, Victoria|Launching Place]] the river becomes quite narrow and recreational use is limited. In the middle reaches, [[canoeing]] and [[kayaking]] is popular, there are a few rapids of easy to medium difficulty depending on the water level.

[[Swimming]] is also popular in the middle reaches throughout summer, particularly around [[Warrandyte]], however, it should be noted that around this area there are submerged mining shafts which can cause undertows that suck swimmers under the surface and into these shafts. In the period 2004-2008, 3 people died in this manner in Warrandyte alone. Swimming is safer downstream, but not advisable below [[Dights Falls]] due to the high levels of pollution.

In the lower reaches, the river is mostly used for [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], there are several rowing sheds along the city stretch east of the Princes Bridge and many private schools have rowing clubs with sheds and berths on the river. At certain times of the year, particularly during the Moomba Festival, this stretch of the river is occupied by [[water skiing]] courses and jumps. The banks of the Yarra River are popular for [[cycling]], [[running]] and [[walking]] where most paths are sealed and in good condition. Two major off-road, sealed trails, the [[Yarra River Trail]] and [[Capital City Trail]] follow the river on its course through the city, while part of the [[Bayside Trail]] also connects with the river.

The river is also popular for [[boating]], in the residential suburb of [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]] some of the larger mansions have private boat moorings, whilst newer developments in Melbourne Docklands have larger marinas as does Pier 31 at Fisherman's Bend and Newport and Williamstown at the river's mouth. Boating is difficult beyond [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] and impossible past [[Dights Falls]]. It is mostly concentrated in central Melbourne where cruises go up and down the river and ferries operate.

===Navigation===
The river can be used by any member of the public provided they abide by the rules of Parks Victoria who administer the river upstream of [[Bolte Bridge]] and the [[Port of Melbourne Corporation]] who administer the area downstream of Bolte Bridge. There is a maximum speed limit of 9 kilometres per hour (5 knots) for all boats operating on the river. Sections of the river are occasionally closed for public events such as [[Moomba]], New Years Eve and Rowing events. <ref>[[Melway]] Edition 36, 2009</ref>

The river is navigable by most boats from its entrance in Hobsons Bay to Dights Falls (a stretch of 22km) and is subject to tidal variations and submerged objects. All users are advised to proceed with caution. There are four bridges on the Yarra River with limited height clearances at high tide: <ref>[[Melway]] Edition 36, 2009</ref>
* Charles Grimes Bridge - 3.2m
* [[Spencer Street Bridge]] - 2.3m (can be less than 2m at extreme high tides - once a month)
* Kings Bridge - 2.4m
* [[Queens Bridge (Melbourne)|Queens Bridge]] - 2.4m
