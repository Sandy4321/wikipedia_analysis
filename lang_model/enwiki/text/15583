"'''Rush'''" is the fifth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on December 5, 1999. It was written by David Amann and directed by [[Robert Lieberman]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Rush" earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.9, being watched by 12.71 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly mixed-to-negative reviews from critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a high school student who is the prime suspect in the bizarre murder of a police officer. They discover that the boy and a couple of friends have been playing with the ability to accelerate their movements to a frequency the human eye can<U+2019>t perceive. 

The idea for "Rush" had been proposed as far back as the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''The X-Files''. However, the original plot of the episode<U+2014>the effect having super speed<U+2014>eventually delved into "deeper" themes, such as drug abuse, boredom, and the teenager experience. Although the episode relied on special effects, many of the scenes were created by manipulating the speed of the camera during filming.

== Plot ==
Tony Reed and two other teenagers meet in the woods late at night in Pittsfield, Virginia but are interrupted by a sheriff's deputy. Moments later the deputy is murdered, killed with his own flashlight. [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) later examine the deputy's body: the blow that killed the man was so ferocious that his glasses were pushed through the back of his skull. They question the suspect, teenager Tony Reed, whose fingerprints were found on the flash light, but he denies any part in the murder. Mulder and Scully agree that Tony is innocent, although Mulder's theory of spirit involvement is not shared by Scully. Scully, on the other hand, suggests they question Tony's friends. Mulder and Scully visit Tony's school and speak with the two teenagers who were with Tony in the woods: the sheriff's son, Max Harden, and his girlfriend Chastity. Chastity seems concerned about Tony when Mulder and Scully tell her he may go to jail. However, Tony is later released when the murder weapon mysteriously goes missing from the evidence room. Mulder and Scully review video footage from the evidence room that shows the flashlight simply disappear. However, a blur on the video footage attracts Mulder's attention and later analysis by an expert reveals the blurred object is solid and matches the local high school's colors. When one of the teachers at the high school who was strongly despised by Max is later attacked and murdered by an unseen force in front of many witnesses, Mulder suspects Max possesses some kind of paranormal ability and is using it to kill.

Mulder believes Harden's changing teenage hormones are giving him paranormal abilities that allow him to attack people without touching them. Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in the woods and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same abilities that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at extreme frequencies, allowing Tony to move extremely fast, making him practically invisible. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, and ligament damage. In short, he is dying of his abilities. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave. Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun. Tony and Max confront each other at the cave. Chastity shoots Max and herself, using her abilities. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, but leaving the question as to what caused the teenagers ability a mystery.<ref name="plot"/>

==Production==
The basic conceit behind "Rush" had been coming together since the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]]. According to series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], the way in which to portray the teenagers on screen was "tricky".<ref name="s66"/> He noted, "it had been a long time since we had dealt with teenage angst. [But] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it."<ref name="s66">Shapiro, p. 66</ref> David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply "[the] effect having the power of super speed would have on trouble teens." However, the story quickly developed "deeper" meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenager experience.<ref name="s67">Shapiro, p. 67</ref>

According to casting director Rick Millikan, choosing actors and actresses for the episode was more difficult than usual. He explained, "it was all teenagers, but this being ''The X-Files'' we were looking for something other than the typical ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210|90210]]''-type kids."<ref name="s67"/> Millikan eventually casted individuals who could play a "subtle kind of evil", as well as display "arrogance" and "vulnerability".<ref name="s67"/> [[Rodney Scott]] was cast as Tony Reed. Scott, at the time, was more notable for his roles as [[David Cassidy]] in the in the 1999 [[television movie]] ''Come On, Get Happy: [[The Partridge Family]] Story'' and William "Will" Krudski on the popular show ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.<ref name="s67"/>

The episode, most notably the scenes featuring the teenagers moving at high speed, relied heavily on special effects. However, instead of creating them on a computer, director [[Robert Lieberman]] was able to create many of the necessary scenes using different camera speeds. In addition, stunt coordinator Danny Wesiles helped arrange the more frantic shots, such as the scene wherein a lunch table kills a teacher.<ref name="s67"/> Executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] later called the scene, "probably one of the most horrific things we've ever done."<ref name="s67"/> Due to the violent nature of the episode, Fox's Standards and Practices department had an issue with the series showing "the impact between the table and the man".<ref name="s67"/> In order to comply, the impact was removed, but the rest of the scene stayed intact. Spotnitz later noted that, "when you take out the impact, the audience's imagination is ten times worse."<ref name="s67"/>

The episode received mostly mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. Kenneth Silber from [[Space.com]] was critical of the episode, arguing that the show was re-using plot lines and that the personalities of the teenagers were wholly uninteresting.<ref name=rush/> He wrote, "This episode unfolds with a bland sense of familiarity. Once again, troubled adolescents are toying with paranormal forces that can only get them into further trouble. Sadly, these adolescents lack interesting personalities, and the force in question remains wholly mysterious."<ref name=rush>{{cite web|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|title=The X-Files - 'Rush'|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050207151900/http://space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_705_991206.html|publisher=Space.com|date=11 August 2000|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode was "Not brilliant, but moderately entertaining."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosell|first=Rich|title=The X-Files: The Complete Seventh Season|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=4807|publisher=DigitallyObsessed|date=27 July 2003|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode two stars out of five.<ref name="shearman">Shearman and Pearson, p. 210</ref> Despite praising the episode's set pieces, they ultimately concluded that "''The X-Files'' just isn't cool anymore daddio."<ref name="shearman"/>
