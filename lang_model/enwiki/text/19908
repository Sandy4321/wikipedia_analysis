[[Dame (title)|Dame]] '''Kiri Janette Te Kanawa''' {{IPA2|k<U+02B0>i<U+027E>i t<U+02B0>e k<U+02B0>an<U+028C>w<U+028C>}} [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]], [[Order of New Zealand|ONZ]], [[Order of Australia|AC]] (born [[March 6]], [[1944]]) is an internationally famous [[New Zealand]] [[Opera_singer#Operatic_voices|opera singer]]. In 1981, she was seen and heard around the world by an estimated 600 million people when she sang [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s "Let the Bright Seraphim" at the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]].

Te Kanawa was born in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], on [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. She has both [[M<U+0101>ori]] and [[Europe]]an ancestry but little is known about her birth parents as she was [[adoption|adopted]] as an infant; She is the adopted daughter of an Irish mother and M<U+0101>ori father. In her teens and early 20s, Te Kanawa was a pop star and popular entertainer at clubs in New Zealand. 

She was formally trained in operatic singing by the celebrated Dame [[Sister Mary Leo]], RSM, who was New Zealand's best-known opera coach.  She began her singing career as a [[mezzo-soprano]], but later developed into a [[soprano]]. Her recording of the "Nuns' Chorus" from the [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss]] operetta ''[[Casanova (opera)|Casanova]]'' was New Zealand's first gold record.

Kiri married [[Desmond Park]], whom she met on a [[blind date]] in [[Auckland]] in August 1967 and married 6 months later. The couple adopted two children, Antonia (1976) and Thomas (1979, named after Kiri's adoptive father). The couple divorced in the late 90s.

==Career==
In 1965 she won the prestigious [[Lexus Song Quest|Mobil Song Quest]], entered by all types of singers, jazz, pop and classical, with her performance of Puccini's "''Vissi d'arte''" from ''[[Tosca]].'' As the winner, she received a grant to study in [[London]].

===Early years in London===
In 1966, without an audition, she enrolled at the [[London Opera Centre]] to study under James Robertson, who is said to have stated that Te Kanawa did not have any singing technique when she arrived at the school but did have a gift for captivating audiences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Garry|coauthors=and Stephen d'Antal|title=Kiri: Her Unsung Story|year=1998|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|id=ISBN 0-00-255942-0}}</ref>

She first appeared on stage as the "Second Lady" in ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberfl<U+00F6>te]]'', as well as in performances of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' in December 1968 at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]]. In 1969, she sang "Elena" in [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s ''[[La donna del lago]]'' at the Camden Festival.  Praise for her "Idamante" in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'' led to an offer of a three-year contract as junior principal at the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House Covent Garden]] where she made her debut as  'Xenia' in ''[[Boris Godunov]]'' and a 'Flower Maiden' in ''[[Parsifal]]'' in 1970, and was also heard as the "Voice from Heaven", an off-stage role, at the end of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlo]]''.  Also, during 1969, she was offered the role of the Countess in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' after an audition in which the conductor, [[Colin Davis]] said "I couldn't believe my ears. I've taken thousands of auditions, but it was such a fantastically beautiful voice."<ref>{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Susie|coauthors=and Jay Shir|title=A Tale of Four Houses: Opera at Covent Garden, La Scala, Vienna and the Met since 1945|year=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|id=ISBN 0-00-255820-3}}</ref> Under director [[John Copley]] Te Kanawa was carefully groomed for the role for a December 1971 opening.

===International career===
Meanwhile, word of her success had reached [[John Crosby (conductor)|John Crosby]] at the [[Santa Fe Opera]], a summer [[list of opera festivals|opera festival]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Mexico]] then about to begin its fifteenth season. He cast her in the role of the Countess in Figaro, which opened on [[30 July]] [[1971]]. "It was two of the newcomers who left the audience dazzled: [[Frederica von Stade]] as Cherubino and Kiri te Kanawa as the Countess.  Everyone knew at once that these were brilliant finds.  History has confirmed that first impression."<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Eleanor|title=The First Twenty Years of the Santa Fe Opera|year=1976|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe, N. Mex.}}</ref>

But on [[1 December]] [[1971]] at Covent Garden, Kiri te Kanawa repeated the Santa Fe triumph and created an international sensation in the same role: "with 'Porgi amor' Kiri knocked the place flat."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lebrecht|first=Norman|title=Covent Garden: The Untold Story: Dispatches from the English Culture War, 1945-2000|year=2000|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=London|id=ISBN 0-684-85143-1}}</ref> It was followed by performances of the Countess at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in autumn 1972, while her [[Metropolitan Opera]] debut in 1974 as Desdemona in ''[[Otello]]'' took place on short notice,  replacing an ill [[Teresa Stratas]] at the last minute.

In subsequent years, she performed at the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], [[Op<U+00E9>ra National de Paris|Paris Opera]], [[Sydney Opera House]], the [[Vienna State Opera]], [[La Scala]], [[San Francisco Opera]], [[Munich]] and [[Cologne]], adding the Mozart roles of Donna Elvira, Pamina, and Fiordiligi, in addition to Italian roles such as Mimi in ''[[La boh<U+00E8>me]]''. She played Donna Elvira in [[Joseph Losey|Joseph Losey's]] 1979 film adaptation of ''[[Don Giovanni (1979 film)|Don Giovanni]]''.

Te Kanawa has a particular affinity for the heroines of [[Richard Strauss]].   Her first appearance in the title role in ''[[Arabella]]'' was at the [[Houston Grand Opera]] in 1977, followed by the roles of the Marschallin in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Countess in ''[[Capriccio (opera)|Capriccio]]''.  Many performances were given under the baton of [[Georg Solti]] and it was with him that she made her first recording of ''Figaro''.

Te Kanawa retired from the opera stage after her performances in [[Samuel Barber]]'s ''[[Vanessa (opera)|Vanessa]]'' with the [[Washington National Opera]] and the [[Los Angeles Opera]] in November/December 2004, but she still performs in concert halls. 

In an interview with UK show host and personality Michael Parkinson,   who asked her to comment on the person she felt was the greatest singer that ever lived,  she replied  "the young Elvis Presley, without any doubt."

==Honours awarded==
Te Kanawa has been overwhelmed with honours. She was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of The Order of the British Empire]] in 1982, invested as an Honorary Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1990 and awarded the prestigious [[Order of New Zealand]] in the 1995 Queen's Birthday Honours List. She has also received honorary degrees from the following universities in the UK: [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], [[University of Durham|Durham]], [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Sunderland|Sunderland]], [[University of Warwick|Warwick]] as well as these universities worldwide: Chicago, Auckland and Waikato as well as being honorary fellow of [[Somerville College, Oxford]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]]. She is also patron of Ringmer Community College, a school in the South-East of England.

==Controversy==
Te Kanawa has always been popular among New Zealanders, but in a 2003 interview with the Melbourne-based [[Herald Sun]] she was critical of the high rate of welfare dependence among the M<U+0101>ori people, angering some of her compatriots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dame Kiri remarks strike sour note|publisher=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=[[2003-03-01]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2810875.stm}}</ref>

Te Kanawa has recently been taken to court by [[John Farnham]] for canceling a concert with the Australian singer after learning that his fans sometimes threw their underwear on stage, which he would then proudly display.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singer in court for refusing to perform|publisher=[[Yahoo!
