'''Henrietta Swan Leavitt''' (July 4, 1868 &ndash; December 12, 1921) was an American [[astronomer]].  A graduate of [[Radcliffe College]], in 1893 Leavitt started working at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] as a "[[human computer|computer]]," examining [[photographic plate]]s in order to measure and catalog the brightness of stars.  Leavitt discovered the relation between the [[luminosity]] and the period of [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid variable stars]].  Though she received little recognition in her lifetime, it was her discovery that first allowed astronomers to measure the distance between the Earth and faraway [[galaxy|galaxies]].  After Leavitt's death, [[Edwin Hubble]] used the luminosity-period relation for Cepheids to determine that the universe is expanding (see [[Hubble's law]]).

==Early years and education==
Henrietta Swan Leavitt, the daughter of [[Congregational church]] minister George Roswell Leavitt<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0705/p15s01-bogn.html|title=Before computers, there were these humans...|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|author=Gregory M.

She attended [[Oberlin College]], and graduated from [[Radcliffe College]], then called the Society for the Collegiate Instruction for Women, with a bachelor's degree in 1892. It wasn't until her fourth year of college that Leavitt took a course in astronomy, in which she earned an A&ndash;.<ref name=Johnson>{{harvnb|Johnson|2005}}</ref>{{rp|27}} 

==Career==
[[File:Astronomer Edward Charles Pickering's Harvard computers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Early photo of <U+2018>[[Harvard Computers|Pickering's Harem]]<U+2019>, as the group of women computers assembled by Harvard astronomer [[Edward Charles Pickering]] was dubbed. The group included Leavitt, [[Annie Jump Cannon]], [[Williamina Fleming]] and [[Antonia Maury]]]]

In 1893, Leavitt began working at the [[Harvard College Observatory]] as one of the [[Harvard Computers|women human "computers"]] hired by [[Edward Charles Pickering]] to measure and catalog the brightness of stars as they appeared in the observatory's [[photographic plate]] collection.  (In the early 1900s, women were not allowed to operate telescopes).<ref>[http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/hubble/people/supernovas.html Exploratorium note]</ref> Because Leavitt had independent means, Pickering initially did not have to pay her. Later, she received $0.30 an hour for her work.<ref name=Johnson></ref>{{rp|32}}

Pickering assigned Leavitt to study "[[variable stars]]," whose luminosity varies over time. According to science writer Jeremy Bernstein, "variable stars had been of interest for years, but when she was studying those plates, I doubt Pickering thought she would make a significant discovery &mdash; one that would eventually change astronomy."<ref>Jeremy Bernstein, [http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-bk-johnson071705,0,558807.story "Review: George Johnson's Miss Leavitt's Stars"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 17, 2005</ref>  Leavitt noted thousands of variable stars in images of the [[Magellanic Clouds]]. In 1908 she published her results in the ''Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College'',<ref>Leavitt, Henrietta S. [http://www.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1908AnHar..60...87L "1777 Variables in the Magellanic Clouds"]. ''Annals of Harvard College Observatory''. LX(IV) (1908) 87-110</ref> noting that a few of the variables showed a pattern: brighter ones appeared to have longer periods. After further study, she confirmed in 1912 that the [[Cepheid variable]]s with greater intrinsic [[luminosity]] did have longer periods, and that the relationship was quite close and predictable.<ref>Miss Leavitt in Pickering, Edward C. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1912HarCi.173....1L "Periods of 25 Variable Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud"] ''Harvard College Observatory Circular'' 173 (1912) 1-3.</ref>

Leavitt used the simplifying assumption that all of the Cepheids within each Magellanic Cloud were at approximately the same distances from the earth, so that their intrinsic brightness could be deduced from their apparent brightness (as measured from the photographic plates) and from the distance to each of the clouds.  "Since the variables are probably at nearly the same distance from the Earth, their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light, as determined by their mass, density, and surface brightness."<ref>[http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/leavitt/leavitt.note.html Periods Of 25 Variable Stars In The Small Magellanic Cloud, Harvard College Observatory Circular 173, 1912, Edward C. Pickering citing Henrietta Leavitt]</ref>

Her discovery is known as the "period-luminosity relationship":  The [[logarithm]] of the period is linearly related to the star's average, intrinsic luminosity (which is defined as a logarithm of the amount of power radiated by the star in the [[visible spectrum]]).  In Leavitt's words, taken from her study of 1,777 variable stars recorded on Harvard's photographic plates, "A straight line can be readily drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima, thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the [Cepheid] variables and their periods."<ref>Miss Leavitt in Pickering, Edward C.

The period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids made them the first "standard candle" in astronomy, allowing scientists to compute the [[Cosmic distance ladder|distances]] to galaxies too remote for [[stellar parallax]] observations to be useful.  One year after Leavitt reported her results, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] determined the distance of several Cepheids in the [[Milky Way]], and with this calibration the distance to any Cepheid could be accurately determined.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernie|first=J.D.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation: A Historical Review|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|year=1969|month=December|volume=81|issue=483|page=707|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1969PASP...81..707F|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> 

Cepheids were soon detected in other galaxies, such as [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] (notably by Edwin Hubble in 1923&ndash;24), and they became an important part of the evidence that "spiral nebulae" are actually independent galaxies located far outside of our own [[Milky Way]]. Thus, Leavitt's discovery would forever change our picture of the universe, as it helped to settle the "[[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]]" on whether the universe was larger than the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite web|title=From Our Galaxy To Island Universes|url=http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/ideas/island.htm|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref>  

The accomplishments of the American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]], who established that the Universe is expanding, were also made possible by Leavitt's groundbreaking research.  "If Henrietta Leavitt had provided the key to determine the size of the cosmos, then it was Edwin Powell Hubble who inserted it in the lock and provided the observations that allowed it to be turned," wrote David H. and Matthew D.H. Clark in their book ''Measuring the Cosmos''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Measuring the Cosmos: How Scientists Discovered the Dimensions of the Universe |author1=David H. Clark |author2=Matthew D.H.

"Sitting at the top of a gentle hill," writes George Johnson in his biography of Leavitt, "the spot is marked by a tall hexagonal monument, on top of which (cradled on a draped marble pedestal) sits a globe. Her uncle [[Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, Jr.|Erasmus Darwin Leavitt]] and his family are also buried there, along with other Leavitts. A plaque memorializing Henrietta and her two siblings who died so young, Mira and Roswell, is mounted directly below the continent of Australia. Off to one side, and more often visited, are the graves of [[Henry James|Henry]] and [[William James]]."<ref name=Johnson></ref>{{rp|90}}

Leavitt was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]], the American Association of University Women, the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an honorary member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Her early passing was seen as a tragedy by her colleagues for reasons that went beyond her scientific achievements.  In an obituary her colleague, [[Solon I. Bailey]], noted that "she had the happy faculty of appreciating all that was worthy and lovable in others, and was possessed of a nature so full of sunshine that, to her, all of life became beautiful and full of meaning."<ref name=Johnson></ref>{{rp|28}}

* The [[asteroid]] [[5383 Leavitt]] and the crater [[Leavitt (crater)|Leavitt]] on the [[Moon]] are named in her honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asteroids and Comets: 5383 Leavitt (4293 T-2) Leavitt Orbital Information|url=http://comets.universetoday.com/l/8395/5383-Leavitt-4293-T-2|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Moon Nomenclature|url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/printerready/science/geography_items/carters/craters_l.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>  
* Unaware of her death four years prior, the Swedish mathematician [[G<U+00F6>sta Mittag-Leffler]] considered nominating her for the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables, offering to send her his monograph on [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]]. Shapley replied, let Mittag-Leffler know that Leavitt had died, and suggested that the true credit belonged to his (Shapley's) ''interpretation'' of her findings. She was never nominated, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.<ref name=Johnson></ref>{{rp|118}}
