==Legislative matters==

Tarver served on the Shreveport City Council when the body was first switched to a [[mayor-council]] government from the previous [[city commission]] system. He and two other African-Americans, the late Herman Farr, a minister, and Hilry Huckaby, Jr., held three of the seven seats on the council. His white colleagues included former Shreveport [[Mayor]] [[James C. Gardner]].<ref>''Jim Gardner and Shreveport'', Vol. 2, Ritz Publications of Shreveport</ref> 

Tarver won his Senate seat in 1983, when he unseated fellow Democrat [[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill Keith]], a [[journalist]] and the author of the 1981 Louisiana law which required balanced treatment in the presentation of [[creation science]] and [[evolution]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s. The measure was struck down in 1987 by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Keith is the last white person to hold this particular Senate seat.

Senator Tarver was chairman of the Insurance Committee and served on the Envronmental Quality and Finance committees as well.<ref name=senate/> He did not seek a sixth term in the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held in October 2003. 

Tarver was unopposed in the senatorial elections of 1987, 1991, and 1999. In 1995, he polled 18,687 votes (56 percent) in the primary against two other Democrats, the Shreveport [[dentist]] C.O. Simpkins and Michael R. Ward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=102195|title=Louisiana election returns, October 21, 1995|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Tarver is seeking a political comeback in the November 19, 2011, general election, when he again challenges his senatorial successor and fellow African American Democrat,  [[Lydia Jackson]]. In the [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] held on October 22, 2011, Jackson led a three-candidate field with 9,393 votes (43.4 percent). Tarver trailed with 9,015 (41.6 percent). A third candidate, the white [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jim Slagle, held the remaining but potentially critical 3,259 votes (15 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/222011/10222011_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 22, 2011|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref>Both the Tarver and Jackson families are long-time advocates for [[civil rights]] in the Shreveport community.
