The '''Egyptian pound''' ([[Arabic]]: {{ArabDIN|<U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0646><U+064A><U+0647> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0635><U+0631><U+0649>}} ''{{ArabDIN|al-Gunaih al-Ma<U+1E63>r<U+012B>}}'') is the current legal currency of [[Egypt]]. The pound is divided into 100 [[piastre]]s ({{ArabDIN|<U+0642><U+0631><U+0634>}} ''qirsh'') or 1000 milliemes ({{ArabDIN|<U+0645><U+0644><U+064A><U+0645>}} ''malleem'').

The [[ISO 4217]] code for the Egyptian pound is '''EGP'''. Locally, the abbreviation '''LE''' or '''L.E.''', which stands for ''livre <U+00E9>gyptienne'' ([[French language|French]] for Egyptian pound) is frequently used. '''E<U+00A3>''' and '''<U+00A3>E''' are also much less-frequently used. The Egyptian Arabic name, ''ginaih'', may be related to the [[English language|English]] name [[guinea (coin)|guinea]].

== History ==

In [[1834]], a Royal Decree promulgating a Parliamentary Bill was issued providing for the issuing of an Egyptian currency based on a [[bimetallic]] base. In [[1836]] the Egyptian pound was minted and put into circulation.

The pound was originally divided into 100 piastres, each of 40 para. In 1885, the para ceased to be issued and the piastre was divided into tenths (oshr al-qirsh). These tenths were renamed milliemes in 1916.

The legal exchange rates were fixed by force of law for important foreign currencies which became acceptable in the settlement of internal transactions. Eventually this led to Egypt using a ''de facto'' gold standard. (1885-1914)

The [[National Bank of Egypt]] issued banknotes for the first time on [[3 April]] [[1899]]. The Central Bank of Egypt and the National Bank of Egypt were unified into the [[Central Bank of Egypt]].

== Coins ==

[[Coin]]s, even for the smallest amounts, are encountered much less frequently than notes, but 5, 10, 20, and 25 piastre coins remain legal currency. The most recent 25 piastre coin is holed.

During late spring in 2005, plans were announced to introduce a new 200 pound note due to high cumulative inflation rates and coins for the 50 piastres and LE 1. 

Effective [[June 1]], [[2006]], LE 1 coin and 50 piastre coin will be introduced and the equivalent bills be scrapped later on. The coins will have faces of [[Cleopatra (disambiguation)|Cleopatra]] and [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]], and LE 1 coin is bimetal. Their availabilities are expected to gradually increase in the coming months.

== Banknotes ==

[[Banknote]]s  worth 5, 10, 25, 50 piastres, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 pounds are in currently circulation. Notes of 25 piastres and above are issued by the [[Central Bank of Egypt]], while 5 and 10 piastres are issued by the state, and the central bank website put the 2 lower valued notes under the category "coins" instead of "banknotes". All Egyptian banknotes are [[bilingualism|bilingual]], with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] texts and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on obverse, and [[English language|English]] and [[Hindu Arabic numerals]] on reverse. It tends to be that the front side has a picture of an [[Islam]]ic building and the back side has a picture of an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian building.
