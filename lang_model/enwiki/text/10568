The '''American Goldfinch''' (''Spinus tristis''), also known as the '''Eastern Goldfinch''' and '''Wild Canary''', is a [[North America]]n [[bird]] in the [[finch]] [[family (biology)|family]]. It is [[bird migration|migratory]], ranging from southern [[Canada]] to [[North Carolina]] during the breeding season, and from just south of the Canadian border to [[Mexico]] during the winter.

The only finch in its [[subfamily]] which undergoes a complete [[molt]], the American Goldfinch displays [[sexual dimorphism]] in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter months, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored [[plumage]] during the breeding season to attract a mate.

The American Goldfinch is a [[granivore]] and [[adaptation|adapted]] for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical [[beak]] to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave [[Territory (animal)|territorially]] during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally [[monogamous]], and produces one brood each year.

Human activity has generally benefited the American Goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas, attracted to [[bird feeders]] installed by humans, which increases its survival rate in these areas. [[Deforestation]] by humans also creates open meadow areas which are the preferred [[habitat]] of the American Goldfinch.

== Taxonomy ==
The American Goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in the landmark 1758 [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of his work ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carolus | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae | location=Stockholm | publisher=Laurentii Salvii|location=[[Stockholm|Holmiae]] | year=1758 | pages=320 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ix0AAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1 | language=Latin | oclc=174638949 | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> It was initially included in the [[genus]] ''Spinus'', a group containing New World goldfinches and [[siskin]]s, but in 1976, ''Spinus'' was merged into the genus ''[[Carduelis]]'' as a [[subgenus]].<ref name="elib">{{cite journal | author=Committee on Classification and Nomenclature | title=Thirty-third Supplement to the American Ornithologists' Union Check-list of North American Birds | journal=The Auk | volume=93 | issue=4 | month=October | year=1976 | url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v093n04/p0875-p0879.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=4 February 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.018 | pages=653}}</ref> Its closest relatives are the [[Lesser Goldfinch]] ''(C. psaltria)'', [[Lawrence's Goldfinch]] ''(C. lawrencei)'', and the [[siskin]]s.

In winter, the range extends from southern Canada and northern [[California]], south to Mexico.<ref name="BNA"/>
* '''''S. t. jewetti''''' is smaller and darker than the other subspecies. It occurs on the coastal slope of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] from southern British Columbia to central California, overlapping with the range of ''C. t. pallidus''.<ref name="BNA"/>
* '''''S. t. salicamans''''' occurs west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range during the summer and in south and central [[Baja California]] to the [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Colorado Desert]] in winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than other subspecies, and in summer, the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies.<ref name="BNA"/>

== Description ==
[[File:American goldfinch winter f.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Male American Goldfinch in winter plumage.]]
The American Goldfinch is a small [[finch]], 11<U+2013>13&nbsp;centimeters (4<U+2013>5&nbsp;in) long, with a [[wingspan]] of 19<U+2013>22&nbsp;centimeters (7<U+2013>9&nbsp;in). It weighs between 11<U+2013>20&nbsp;grams (0.39<U+2013>0.71&nbsp;oz).<ref name="Georgia Wildlife Guide">{{cite web | url=http://dromus.nhm.uga.edu/~GMNH/gawildlife/index.php?page=speciespages/species_page&key=ctristis | work=Georgia Wildlife Web | publisher=The Georgia Museum of Natural History | title=''Carduelis tristis'' | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/>
The shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of [[seed]]s from the seed heads of [[thistle]]s, [[sunflower]]s, and other plants.<ref name="Hinterlands"/>

The American Goldfinch undergoes a [[Moult|molt]] in the spring and autumn. It is the only [[Carduelis|cardueline]] finch to undergo a molt twice a year.<ref name="ChipperWoods"/> During the winter moult it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male.<ref name="Hinterlands"/> The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and at the edges of the short, notched tail.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/> The [[sexual dimorphism]] displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.<ref name="Hinterlands"/>

Once the spring molt is complete, the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow, a color produced by [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s from plant materials in its diet,<ref>{{cite journal | last=McGraw | first=Kevin | coauthors=Hill, Geoffrey; Parker, Robert S. | title=The physiological costs of being colourful: nutritional control of carotenoid utilization in the American goldfinch, ''Carduelis tristis'' | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=69 | issue=3 | pages=653<U+2013>660 | year=2005 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6W9W-4F7YMVJ-3&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2bbcb3ef82e6f9d6065238bb4fb65daa | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.018 | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight.<ref name="DNR">{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12202-61327--,00.htm | publisher=State of Michigan | author=Department of Natural Resources | title=American Goldfinch (''Carduelis tristis'') | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib.<ref name="ChipperWoods">{{cite web | title=American Goldfinch | work=Chipper Woods Bird Observatory | publisher=Wild Birds Unlimited | url=http://www.wbu.com/chipperwoods/photos/goldfinch.htm | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming [[Buff (colour)|buff]] below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches.<ref name="SDNHM"/> In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.

The immature American Goldfinch has a dull brown back, and the underside is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration is the same in both genders.<ref name="SDNHM">{{cite journal | author=Unitt, Philip | coauthors=Perretta, Nicole | title=Focus on American, Lawrence's, and Lesser Goldfinches | journal=Wrendering | month=Winter | year=2001 | url=http://www.sdnhm.org/research/birdatlas/focus/goldfinches.html | publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum | accessdate=4 February 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.018 | volume=69 | page=653}}</ref>

The [[bird song|song]] of the American Goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A ''tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit'' call is often given in flight; it may also be described as ''per-chic-o-ree''.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/> While the female [[Avian incubation|incubates]] the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous ''teeteeteeteete'' sound. The young begin to use a call of ''chick-kee'' or ''chick-wee'' shortly before [[fledge|fledging]], which they use until they have left the nest entirely.<ref name="Hinterlands"/> There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a ''sweeet'' call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract [[predator]]s, and a ''bearbee'' used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.<ref>{{cite journal

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Female american goldfinch.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Female American Goldfinch.]]
The American Goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive, such as [[field (agriculture)|fields]], meadows, [[flood plain]]s, as well as roadsides, [[orchards]], and gardens. It may also be found in open [[deciduous]] and [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands and areas of [[Secondary forest|secondary growth]].<ref name="Terres">{{cite book | last=Terres | first=John K. | authorlink=John Kenneth Terres | title=The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds | publisher=Knopf | year=1980 | location=New York | pages=329 | isbn=0-394-46651-9 }}</ref> This [[habitat]] preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide"/>

The summer [[breeding range]] stretches across North America from coast to coast. It is bounded on the north by [[Saskatchewan]] and stretches south across North America to [[North Carolina]] on the east coast, and northern [[California]] on the west coast.<ref name="Cornell Bird Guide">{{cite web | url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/American_Goldfinch_dtl.html | work=All About Birds | publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology | title=American Goldfinch | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The American Goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact [[flock (birds)|flocks]], which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.<ref name="Smithsonian"/>

Its winter range includes southern [[Canada]] and stretches south through the [[United States]] to parts of [[Mexico]]. In winter, in the northern part of its range, the finch may move nearer to [[bird feeder|feeders]] if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.<ref name="ADW">{{cite web | author=Dewey, T. | coauthors=Roof, J. | title=Carduelis Tristis | work=Animal Diversity Web | publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Carduelis_tristis.html | year=2007 | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref>

Attempts were made to introduce the American Goldfinch into [[Bermuda]] in the 19th century, and [[Tahiti]] in 1938, however the species failed to become established.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduced Birds of the World: The worldwide history, distribution and influence of birds introduced to new environments |last=Long |first=John L. |year=1981 |publisher=Reed |location=Terrey Hills, Sydney |isbn=0-589-50260-3|page=449}}</ref>

== Behavior ==
[[File:American Goldfinch-27527.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Male (left) and female (right) at a thistle feeder.]]
The American Goldfinch is [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] during the non-breeding season, when it is often found in large flocks, usually with other finches. Flocks generally fly in an undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path.<ref name="ADW"/> During the breeding season, it lives in loose [[Bird colony|colonies]]. While the nest is being constructed, the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory, driving them away, and the female reacts in the same way toward other females. This aggressiveness fades once the eggs have been laid.<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite book | author=Sullivan, J. | title=Hunting for Frogs on Elston, and Other Tales from Field & Street | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | url=http://books.google.com/?id=2ENJUxG5cQwC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=Carduelis+tristis| year=1980 | isbn=0-226-77993-9 | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref>

The American Goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is [[alarm call]]ing. Predators include [[snakes]], [[weasel]]s, [[squirrels]], and [[Blue Jay]]s, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and [[hawks]] and [[cats]], which pose a threat to both young and adults.

=== Diet ===
The American Goldfinch is a [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] feeder. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide [[protein]]. Its [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] consists of the seeds from a wide variety of [[Annual plant|annual]] plants, often those of weeds grasses and trees, such as [[thistle]], [[teasel]], [[dandelion]], [[ragweed]], [[mullein]], [[Cosmos (plant)|cosmos]], [[Salsify|goatsbeard]], [[sunflower]], and [[alder]].<ref name="Terres"/> However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring [[Guizotia abyssinica|Niger seed]] (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).<ref name="hearth"/>

[[File:Carduelis-tristis-001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Male perched on a thistle plant]]
Unlike some finch species, the American Goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American Goldfinch feeds on the [[catkin]]s hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.<ref name="Hinterlands">{{cite web | url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=24 | author=Hayakawa, E. | title=American Goldfinch | work=Hinterland Who's Who | publisher=Canadian Wildlife Service & Canadian Wildlife Federation | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
The American Goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch.<ref name="Hinterlands"/> This may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.<ref name="Sullivan"/>

The courtship rituals of the American Goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male is able to signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Rosen | first=Rafael F. | coauthors=Tarvin, Keith A. | title=Sexual signals of the male American goldfinch | journal=Ethology | volume=112 | issue=10 | pages=1008<U+2013>1019 | year=2006 | accessdate=4 February 2008 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01257.x | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/eth/2006/00000112/00000010/art00010}}</ref> If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.<ref name="Hinterlands"/>

Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.<ref name="Hinterlands"/>

[[File:Aug 5 2006 goldfinchnest.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Nest of an American Goldfinch]]The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a [[deciduous]] shrub or tree at a height of up to 10&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft). The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the female works in 10<U+2013>40&nbsp;minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass.<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite journal | author=Bent, A. C. | coauthors=Cleveland, Arthur; ''et al.'' | journal=Smithsonian Institution United States National Museum Bulletin | volume=237 | issue=1 | pages=447<U+2013>466 | url=http://www.birdsbybent.com/ch41-50/goldfinch.html | title=American Goldfinch ''Carduelis tristis'' | year=1968 | accessdate=4 February 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.018}}</ref> The inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6.5&nbsp;centimeters (2.5&nbsp;in).<ref name="Terres"/> The rim is reinforced with bark bound by [[Spider web|spiderwebs]] and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail. The nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water, and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest.<ref name="ChipperWoods"/>

American Goldfinches lay four to six bluish-white [[egg (biology)|eggs]], which are oval in shape and about 16&nbsp;x&nbsp;12&nbsp;millimeters (.6&nbsp;x&nbsp;.45&nbsp;in), roughly the size of a [[peanut]].<ref name="Smithsonian"/> It is thought that they are laid during the night.<ref name="ADW"/> The eggs are incubated by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.<ref name="Smithsonian"/>

The chicks hatch 12<U+2013>14&nbsp;days after incubation begins. Like all [[passerine]]s, the chicks are [[altricial]]; they are born naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey [[down feather|down]], and closed eyes.<ref name="Stanford">{{cite paper | author=Ehrlich, P.R.; D.S. Dobkin; D. Wheye | title=Precocial and Atricial | publisher=Birds of Stanford | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Precocial_and_Altricial.html | year=1988 | format=.HTML | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The mother bird feeds her young [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] seeds and insects as they grow.<ref name="DNR"/> The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing the growth of olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11<U+2013>15&nbsp;days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.<ref name="Hinterlands"/>

American Goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites, particularly [[Brown-headed Cowbird]]s. One study found that 9% of nests had Brown-headed Cowbird eggs in them.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Middleton | first=Alex L. | title=Effect of cowbird parasitism on American Goldfinch nesting | journal=Auk | volume=2 | issue=94 | pages=304<U+2013>307 | year=1977 | url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v094n02/p0304-p0307.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> American Goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of Brown-headed Cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the fact that the American Goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of Brown-headed Cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough [[nutrition]]; the seed-rich diet of American Goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Middleton | first=Alex L. | title=Failure of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism in the nests of the American Goldfinch | journal=Journal of Field Ornithology | volume=2 | issue=62 | pages=200<U+2013>203 | year=1991 | url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/JFO/v062n02/p0200-p0203.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=4 February 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.018 | last2=Hill | first2=G | last3=Parker | first3=R}}</ref>

== Relationship with humans ==
The American Goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard [[Birdwatching|birders]] attract it using feeders containing [[Niger seed|Nyjer thistle seed]],<ref name="hearth"/> or by planting grasses and [[perennial plant]]s, such as [[zinnias]], [[cosmos (plant)|cosmos]], [[bee balm]], or [[globe thistle]], which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds [[bird feeding]] (see [[bird feeder]] for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.<ref name="hearth">{{cite web | author=Hollis, Elece | title=Backyard Birdwatching: The American Goldfinch | work=Garden and Hearth | url=http://www.gardenandhearth.com/Bird-Watching/American-Goldfinch.htm | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref>

The American Goldfinch is not threatened by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range.<ref name="iucn">{{IUCN2006 | assessors=BirdLife International | year=2004 | id=53442 | title=Carduelis tristis | downloaded=12 May 2006}}</ref><ref name="ITIS">{{cite web | url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=179236 | publisher=ITIS-North America | work=Integrated Taxonomic Information System | title=''Carduelis tristis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) | accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American Goldfinch.
