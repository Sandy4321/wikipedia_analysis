== Plot ==

In Manhattan Dr. Saul Grisson finds a fire outside his apartment. By the time the fire fighters arrive they find no fire or fire damage, but Grisson lies there dead.

[[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) receives a tape cassette with his newspaper that includes Grissom's 911 call. Mulder brings it to Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]]'s attention, but a young agent, [[Alex Krycek]] opened the case first. Mulder calls former partner [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and asks her to perform an autopsy on Grissom's corpse. Mulder heads to the Grissom Sleep Disorder Center in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and is confronted by Krycek soon afterwards, upset at Mulder for ditching him. The two head down to Quantico to see Scully, who says that Grissom's body shows no signs of a fire, but his body believed it was burning.

In a Brooklyn apartment, Henry Willig, a Vietnam veteran is approached by his fellow Marine, Augustus Cole. Suddenly a group of wounded Vietnamese appear and gun him down. Examining his corpse, Mulder and Krycek find a scar on his neck and realize he was stationed in the Special Forces in Vietnam in 1970, one of only two survivors, the other being Augustus Cole. They head to the V.A. Medical Center in New Jersey where Cole is being held, only to find that he was discharged, despite the fact that his doctor doesn't remember doing so.

Mulder receives a phone call from the mysterious X, who meets with him and gives him information on a secret military project that Grissom performed where he eradicated the need for sleep. X provides him with the name of another member of the squad who was mistakenly reported as killed in action. A man matching Cole's description robs a drug store and the SWAT team members coming after him shoot each other. Mulder believes that Cole's years of sleeplessness have provided him with telekinetic abilities. Mulder and Krycek meet with Matola soon afterwards, who says that he hasn't slept in 24 years due to the experiment. He reveals that there was another doctor who was part of the squad, Dr. Girardi.

Mulder and Krycek head to the subway station, where Girardi is expected to arrive due to Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there who shoots Girardi, but it is actually all in his head. In reality, Cole has captured Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as the others. By searching surveillance equipment they track his location and find Girardi there wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, thinking Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him. Mulder approaches the mortally wounded Cole and hears his last words: "Good... night."

Mulder and Scully find all of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] and others, telling them Scully is a bigger problem then they anticipated. The Cigarette Man says "Every problem has a solution". <small><ref name="plot1">{{cite book | year=1995 | author=Lowry,Brian | title=The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files|page=169-170|publisher=Harper Prism| language=English }} </ref></small><small><ref name="plot2">{{cite book | year=1996 | author=Lovece, Frank | title=The X-Files Declassified|page=114-116|publisher=Citadel Press| language=English }} </ref></small>

== Production ==

Writer [[Howard Gordon]] was initially inspired to write this episode based on insomnia he was suffering at the time. Gordon, who wrote many episodes with [[Alex Gansa]] in season one made his solo writing debut with this episode. <small><ref name="writer">{{cite book | year=1995 | author=Lowry,Brian | title=The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files|page=170|publisher=Harper Prism| language=English }} </ref></small> Originally [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had penned down a script for the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]], which shared the same theme as "Sleepless". Which was "What makes the perfect soldier?" He also liked the twist on sleep, being that "sleep is where demons is released in our dreams." As these characters were haunted by their memories, because they were not able to sleep. Carter sees this episodes as one of his favorites.<small><ref name="Commentary">Carter, Chris. (1994).
