The game first appeared only in Japan on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). It has been ported with minor differences to [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] and Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]]. An [[original video animation]] produced in 1994 called ''[[Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals]]'' serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game.

The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence.

''Final Fantasy V'' has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded [[Final Fantasy character classes|Job System]]. Despite the lack of an early release in territories other than Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two&nbsp;million copies. The PlayStation version has earned "[[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]]" status, selling more than 350,000&nbsp;copies.

== Gameplay ==

''Final Fantasy V'' includes many standard role-playing elements as well as renovated features introduced in earlier ''Final Fantasy'' games. Characters grow in strength by gaining [[experience point]]s from [[random encounter]]s with monsters on the [[overworld]] or in a [[dungeon crawl|dungeon]]. Experience culminates in a "level up" in which party members' [[attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]], such as [[hit point]]s or magic power, increase. A menu-based management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character's selected job outside of battle as well as to save the game's progress. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, [[Chocobo]], hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or [[common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airship]] depending on the situation. Most towns scattered across the world contain inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side quests]] that become available as the story progresses.<ref name="Sidequests">{{cite web | author=Square Enix staff | title=Optional Side Quests | url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFV/side.html | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2006-08-29}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy V'' is the second ''Final Fantasy'' game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system, in which time flows continuously for both the player and enemies during combat.<ref name="Gameplay"/> This system was first established in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' by battle planners Hiroyuki It<U+014D> and [[Akihiko Matsui]].<ref name="ATB in FFIV">{{cite book | year=1991 | editor=Square Co. staff | title=Final Fantasy IV (SFC Version) instruction manual | pages=18 | publisher=Square Co. | language=Japanese}}</ref>, but in that game, there was no way to visibly anticipate which character's turn would come up next.<ref name="ATB in FFIV-2">{{cite web | author=Falcon, Jade |date=2006-01-01 | title=Final Fantasy IV<U+2014>Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff4/reviews/ff4rdrev6.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> In ''Final Fantasy V'', the player can see which playable character's turn is next in battle, in the form of a time gauge<U+2014>or "ATB Bar"<U+2014>which fills according to a character's speed. When the selected character's turn arrives, the player can execute one of several commands, such as attacking the enemy with an equipped weapon, using a special ability or item, or changing the character's row position.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |title=Final Fantasy V Advance: The Official Nintendo Player's Guide |pages=14-15 |isbn=1-59812-017-4 |author=Meyers, Andy |year=2006}}</ref> The ATB mechanic with a gauge, as seen in ''Final Fantasy V'', has been used in nearly every following title in the series.<ref name="judgeito"/>

=== Job System ===
{{seealso|Final Fantasy character classes}}
[[Image:Final Fantasy V - Job System.png|thumb|left|The Job System is a defining feature of ''Final Fantasy V'']]
The main feature of the gameplay of ''Final Fantasy V'' is the Job System designed by [[Hiroyuki It<U+014D>]].<ref name="judgeito">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2007/q3/100107bb.html |title=Square Enix's Finest |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |author=Boulette, Bryan |work=[[RPGamer]] |accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> Players can choose jobs for their character to learn. This system allows each character to gain special abilities and potentially master up to 22 unique jobs (26 in the Game Boy Advance version). Each character begins with a default "Freelancer" class, and as the player acquires crystal shards, new jobs become available.<ref name="Gameplay">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=17, 18, 14, 5, 58, 59 | publisher=Square Enix |  id=SLUS-00879GH}}</ref>

A separate form of experience<U+2014>Ability Points (ABP)<U+2014>is used to improve characters' job levels, while they continue to earn regular experience points.<ref name="Gameplay"/> As job levels increase, new skills become available for that character to use in a new form of customization: characters learn job-specific abilities that may be carried over to a new job. For example, a character with the job of [[Warrior (character class)|Knight]] who has also earned job levels as a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Black Mage|Black Mage]] may set Black Magic as a secondary command; allowing the use of both Black Mage and Knight abilities in battle. The nature of these abilities varies; while some may allow for selectable commands in battle, others may be innate to the class or automatically activated when conditions are met, such as the [[Thief (character class)|Thief]]'s "Caution" skill, which prevents rear attacks from enemies.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |title=Final Fantasy V Advance: The Official Nintendo Player's Guide |pages=17, 20 |isbn=1-59812-017-4 |author=Meyers, Andy |year=2006}}</ref> This system allows for deeper customization of characters.<ref name="GameSpot Review">{{cite web | author=Vestal, Andrew| date=1999-09-30| title=GameSpot Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasyanthology/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> While many of the jobs have appeared previously in the series, ''Final Fantasy V'' introduces a number of new classes including the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Blue Mage|Blue Mage]], [[Final Fantasy character classes#Time Mage|Time Mage]], and [[Final Fantasy character classes#Mime|Mime]], adding new elements to combat.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |title=Final Fantasy V Advance: The Official Nintendo Player's Guide |pages=102-107 |isbn=1-59812-017-4 |author=Meyers, Andy |year=2006}}</ref>

=== Setting ===

The [[backstory]] of ''Final Fantasy V'' is revealed during the course of the game.  One millennium before the events of the main story, a powerful mage named Enuo emperiled the world using the power of an evil entity known as the "Void". The people of the world retaliated, using twelve legendary weapons to vanquish Enuo. Because the Void could not be destroyed, the people split the world's four [[classical element|elemental]] Crystals into two sets, which sequentially caused the world itself to split. The Void then became sealed in a dimensional cleft between the two worlds.<ref name="Worlds">'''Gill:''' A thousand years ago the evil presence Enuo held the power of the Void. A long battle ensued, and finally the people defeated Enuo with the twelve legendary weapons<U+2026> but the Void could not be destroyed. As a last resort they split the crystals, which in turn split the two worlds. They then sealed the Void in the N-zone between the two worlds. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy V |developer=Square Co |publisher= Square Electronic Arts |date=1999-09-30 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

Nearly 1,000&nbsp;years passed without incident and both worlds prospered due to the powers of their Crystals of Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. Several kingdoms and towns developed, and travel by ship acted as a prominent means of commerce and communication.
Evil spirits had been sealed inside a tree in the Great Forest of Moore, and the tree soon transformed. The being emerged as [[Characters of Final Fantasy V#Exdeath|Exdeath]], the game's primary antagonist. As he attempted to claim the world for himself, a group of heroes called the "Four Warriors of Dawn" (named Galuf, Xezat, Dorgann, and Kelger) defeated and sealed him within the parallel world using its Crystals, and peace returned for another 30&nbsp;years.<ref name="Memory">'''Galuf:''' I am not from this earth!

=== Story ===
[[Image:Final Fantasy V death crystal screenshot.png|thumb|King Tycoon approaches the Wind Crystal seconds before it shatters]]
''Final Fantasy V'' begins on a day when the world's wind currents begin to slow down. Concerned, the King of Tycoon travels to the Wind Shrine, which holds the Crystal of Wind, only to see it shatter into pieces upon his arrival. Meanwhile, a [[meteorite]] plunges to the planet's surface in the lands near Tycoon Castle. Resting in the woods, Bartz investigates the meteor, and comes across a young woman, Lenna, under attack. After rescuing her, they discover an old man in the wreckage with partial [[amnesia]] named Galuf. Lenna explains that she is on her way to the Wind Shrine after her father<U+2014>causing Galuf to suddenly recall that he needs to go there as well<U+2014>and accompanies her. Bartz continues on his way but returns and rescues them from more enemies. The three travel together, but the path by land is blocked by the meteor. With the help of the pirate captain Faris, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Wind Crystal and no sign of Tycoon. The shards react to their presence, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect the Crystals.<ref name="Tycoon">'''King Tycoon:''' The wind crystal is shattered, and the other three are at great risk.

They learn the crystals are a seal binding the warlock Exdeath, and that each crystal is being exploited for its powers, which will eventually cause them to shatter and make the world itself uninhabitable.<ref name="Crystals">'''Reina:''' For a while nothing would change<U+2026> But gradually, the earth would decay and the waters would stagnate.

Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives, and helps restore Galuf's memory completely, and he recalls he is actually from a distant world and departs with his granddaughter. With help, Bartz and the others resolve to travel to Galuf's world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are are blown to a distant continent when a barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.<ref name="King">'''Bartz:''' Thought you were just some old geezer<U+2026> but a king?! / '''Galuf:''' Yeah, well<U+2026> / '''Bartz:''' What a surprise! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy V |developer=Square Co |publisher= Square Electronic Arts |date=1999-09-30 |platform=PlayStation}}</ref>

The party meets Kelger, one of Galuf's companions and one the Four Warriors of Dawn, and learn that Bartz's father was part of their group. Joining forces with another Warrior of Dawn, they deactivate the barrier around Exdeath's castle, but at the cost of his life. They then learn of Exdeath's origins as the mage Enuo, and travel to the Guardian Tree to dispel the seals within, only to by trapped by Exdeath and immobolized. Krile arrives to help, but is trapped in a ring of fire. Galuf frees himself, saves his granddaughter, and fights Exdeath until the warlock collapses and retreats. After dying of his wounds, despite the party's efforts to save him, Galuf's spirit imparts upon Krile all of his abilities.<ref name="Death">'''Galuf:''' I<U+2019>ve borrowed the power of Elder's Tree, which protected the crystals for 1000&nbsp;years.

With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence. Gathering weapons and magic that had been used against Enuo, the party enters the Rift, where Exdeath reveals his true form, a massive tree. With help of their fallen allies, the party survives his use of the Void and attack, weakening him until the Void devours him. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying all reality and then himself.<ref name="Final">'''Neo Exdeath:''' I am Neo Exdeath!

The game's ending varies based on how many people are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after his defeat. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.<ref>'''Narrator:''' In the beginning, there was only the Void... But from the Void came four essences. They formed the crystals, and the world was born. Hope blessed the earth. Courage blazed into flame. Care and devotion turned water into the seeds of life. The passion for knowledge spread intelligence and wisdom on the winds. If ever the Void threatens to engulf the world, so long as the four essences still exist in man, light will be born anew.

While not initially released in North America, the game received mixed reception from import reviews. [[1UP.com]]'s staff stated that while the game's story was very weak, the gameplay was "another story", heavily praising the job system and the feature to combine abilities from different job classes, and gave it a score of B-.<ref name="review1up"/> [[Allgame]]'s review shared similar sentiments regarding the storyline and job system, adding praise for the addition of hidden events and items for players to search for, giving the game a score of 3.5 out of 5.<ref name="allgame">{{cite web |publisher=[[All Media Group]] |work=[[Allgame]] |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=15166&tab=review |title=Final Fantasy V |accessdate=2009-07-03 |author=Borowski, David}}</ref> [[RPGamer]] found that the game improved on the visual presentation, menu system, and overall field navigation of ''Final Fantasy IV'', but the "maddeningly high encounter rate", "average sound selection", and "washed out" color palette hurt the game's presentation, giving it a score of 5/10.<ref name="RPGamer Review">{{cite web| author=Long, Andrew | title=Final Fantasy V<U+2014>Import Retroview | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff5/reviews/ff5strev1.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-08-11}}</ref>

Critics likewise gave mixed reviews of the ''Anthologies'' version of the game. [[GameSpot]] criticized the game for having "paper-thin characters" and a cliche plot, augmented by a lack of character development during the game's fetch quests. They went further to say that the translation was terrible and overshadowed by the two previous fan efforts.<ref name="GameSpot Review"/> [[IGN]] called ''Final Fantasy V''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s graphics "dated" but cited "incredibly engrossing" job system as the game's highlight and praised its music.<ref name="IGN Review">{{cite web | author=Reyes, Francesca | date=1999-10-07 | title=Final Fantasy Anthology| url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161674p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref> ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' repeated the sentiments towards the job system, adding that while the game suffered from long [[load times]] periodically, ''Final Fantasy V'' was the main reason to buy the collection.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=124|page=248|month=November|year=1999|last=Hsu|first=Dan|authorlink=Dan Hsu|coauthors=Che Chou, Crispin Boyer, Chris Kohler}}</ref>

In comparison, reviews of the Game Boy Advance re-release of the game were mostly positive. GameSpot's review regarded the game more favorably than it's PlayStation counterpart, calling it "better than ever" and citing the strong localization of the script and extensive special features. They further stated that the while the game's characters seemed unlikable and that the plot felt "predictable or trite", they felt both aspects were superior to many of today's games, giving the game a score of 8.5.<ref name="review1Gspot"/> ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' stated that "while playing ''Final Fantasy V'' is a chore on the PlayStation, it's good fun on the GBA because of the vastly improved translation and new features", further calling it the "definitive" version of one of the series' best titles.<ref>{{citation|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Future US]]|title=Quote from Chris Hoffman|issue=212|page=99}}</ref> IGN gave the game a score of 8.5, calling it a "must-own" for the portable system and describing it further as always an "entertaining and surprisingly deep role-playing game."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/753/753521p1.html |title=Final Fantasy V Advance |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2007-01-08 |author=Dunham, Jeremy |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> 1UP.com stated the port of the game from the Super Famicom to the Game Boy Advance was "rock solid", and added that while the game's story started off at a slow pace, it gradually improved. The review further praised the addition of features and removal of questionable ones that had been added to the ''Anthologies'' version of the game.<ref name="gba-1up-r"/> [[GameDaily]] gave the game a score of 7/10, noting that while enjoyable, the high encounter rate, the necessity to constantly engage in battle to gain abilities through the job system, and other aspects made the game feel repetitive at times.<ref name="gamedaily">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/games/final-fantasy-v-advance/game-boy-advance/game-reviews/review/5612/1406/ |author=Faylor, Chris |work=[[GameDaily]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=2006-11-08 |title=Final Fantasy V Advance |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>
