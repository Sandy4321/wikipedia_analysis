'''Tropical Cyclone Hettie''' (RSMC Nadi Designation: '''08F''', JTWC Designation: '''''11P''''') was the eighth Tropical Disturbance, sixth Tropical Depression, and the first Tropical Cyclone of the [[2008<U+2013>09 South Pacific cyclone season<U+200E>]]. Cyclone Hettie, is currently the strongest depression to form this season.

Late on January&nbsp;24, the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in [[Nadi, Fiji]], reported that a weak Tropical Disturbance, had formed within a monsoon trough, to the north of the Fijian dependency of [[Rotuma]]. The next day after the disturbance had made landfall on Rotuma, it was designated as Tropical Depression 08F. A [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]] was released by the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), early on January&nbsp;27. The depression was not upgraded to a [[Tropical Cyclone]] until the next day when it was named as Hettie by RSMC Nadi whilst the JTWC designated Hettie as Tropical Cyclone 11P. As Hettie moved towards the southeast it did not intensify any further and was downgraded to a depression the next day. Over the next couple of days it moved slowly towards the southeast and slowly weakend before being downgraded to an area of low pressure late on January&nbsp;31. There was very minimal damage from Cyclone Hettie on [[Rotuma]] and in [[Tonga]] with 55.8&nbsp;mm of rainfall faling on Rotuma during January&nbsp;24 and January&nbsp;25. There was also no deaths reported within [[Fiji]] or within [[Tonga]].

On January&nbsp;24, 2009, the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in [[Nadi, Fiji]], reported that a weak tropical disturbance, had formed to the north of the Fijian dependency of [[Rotuma]].<ref name="Tropical Disturbance Summary 24-01-09 21z">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5e4uRBsIY|publisher=[[Fiji Meteorological Service]]|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary 24-01-09 21z|date=2009-01-24|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> At this time the disturbance was located within a Monsoonal Trough, and in an environment of low vertical wind shear.<ref name="Tropical Disturbance Summary 24-01-09 21z"/> Early on January 25, the tropical disturbance made landfall on Rotuma with winds of 35&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph).<ref name="Track Map">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5eAdWIEjt|publisher=[[Fiji Meteorological Service]]|title=Tropical Cyclone Track and Threat Map 24-01-2009 12z|date=2009-01-24|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> Later that day RSMC Nadi reported that the disturbance had organised enough to be classified as Tropical Depression 08F.<ref name="Tropical Disturbance Summary 25-01-09 21z">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5e6X02Z07|publisher=[[Fiji Meteorological Service]]|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary 25-01-09 21z|date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2009-01-27}}</ref> During the afternoon of January&nbsp;26 the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) reported that the low level circulation center, was located within an area of moderate vertical wind shear.<ref name="ABWP10">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5e7SdsCkb|publisher=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and south pacific Oceans|date=2009-01-26|accessdate=2009-01-28}}</ref> They also reported that animated infrared imagery had shown that deep convection was flaring on the eastern boundary of the low level circulation center.<ref name="ABWP10"/>

This was the third time that a Tropical Cyclone had been named as Hettie within the South Pacific by RSMC Nadi being used in the 1981-82 and the 1991-92 South Pacific cyclone seasons.<ref name="81-82">{{cite web|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Hettie 1982|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/silo/cyclones_sh.cgi?region=spacifico&syear=1981&eyear=1981&cyclone=13&loc=0|accessdate=2008-01-31|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]}}</ref><ref name="91-92">{{cite web|year=2007|title=Tropical Cyclone Hettie 1982|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/silo/cyclones_sh.cgi?region=spacifico&syear=1991&eyear=1991&cyclone=26&loc=0|accessdate=2008-01-31|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]]}}</ref>
