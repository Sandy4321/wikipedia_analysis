One of the earliest wrestlers to appear on television, he teamed with many of the top wrestlers of the day including [[Ray Vilmer]], [[Killer Kowalski]] and [[Freddie Blassie|"Classy" Freddie Blassie]]. Although never winning a world title during his career, he was involved in many high profile feuds including [[Ernie Dusek]], [[Paul Boesch]] <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/personalities/boesch_paul/career.html |title=The Career of Paul Boesch -- One Man, One Sport, One Lifetime -- 53 Years on the Mat |accessdate=2007-04-05 |author=Boesch, Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1981 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Wrestling News |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref>, [[Sandor Szabo (wrestler)|Sandor Szabo]], [[George Zaharias]] <ref>''"'Glamour Boy' Wrestles Tonight"''. <u> Washington Post. </u> 24 Oct 1940</ref> <ref>''"Torrid Mat Foes to Meet In Rematch"''. <u> Washington Post. </u> 27 Oct 1940</ref> and NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Lou Thesz]]. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.comics101.com/kentuckyfriedrasslin//?mode=project&action=view&project=Kentucky%20Fried%20Rasslin&chapter=28 |title=Kentucky Fried Rasslin': The Beverly Hills Blonde Bomber |accessdate=2007-04-05 |author=Bowden, Scott |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-12-07 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Comics101.com |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }} </ref> 

He was also the trainer of several wrestlers of the "Golden Age of Wrestling"-era including [[Wilbur Snyder]] and, along with [[Lou Thesz]], his son [[Nick Bockwinkel]] who would eventually become a major star in the [[American Wrestling Association]] winning the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] 6 times during the 1970s and 1980s. 

A personal friend of promoter [[Lord James Blears|Lord James "Tallyho" Blears]], he convinced Blears to allow Nick Bockwinkel to compete in his [[NWA Hawaii]] territory <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingfigs.com/inner2.php?id=438&page_id=1 |title=Iaukea reminisces about 50th-state wrestling |accessdate=2007-04-05 |author=Ohira, Rod|date=2005-07-24|publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser}} </ref> and later teamed with his son during the early 1950s. <ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/awa/awa26.htm |title=Regional Territories: AWA |accessdate=2007-04-05 |author=Zordani, Jim|date=2004 |publisher=KayfabeMemories.com}} </ref> 

Retiring during the late 1950s, he briefly came out of retirement to team with his son to face [[Verne Gagne]] and his son [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg]] in [[Montreal]] at a memorial show for promoter [[Johnny Rougeau]] in 1984; Bockwinkel, at age 72, is one of the oldest wrestlers to ever compete in a professional wrestling match. He died in St. Louis, Missouri on March 25, 1986. 

Nick Bockwinkel later acknowledged his father in his induction speeches for the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2003 and the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2007.
