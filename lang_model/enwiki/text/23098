'''Rahul Sharad Dravid''' ([[Kannada]]:<U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0CB9><U+0CC1><U+0CB2><U+0CCD><U+200C> <U+0CB6><U+0CB0><U+0CA6><U+0CCD><U+200C> <U+0CA6><U+0CCD><U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0CB5><U+0CBF><U+0CA1><U+0CCD><U+200C>) {{audio|Rahul_Dravid.ogg|pronunciation}} (born [[11 January]], [[1973]] in [[Indore]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]) is an Indian cricketer, and the current captain of the [[Indian cricket team]]. He grew up in [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]. He started his international cricket career in [[1996]]. He is, at present, ranked the 7th best Test batsmen by the ICC in world cricket and has the highest [[Test Cricket|Test]] [[batting average]] of any Indian batsman in history. He became the 6th player in history and the 3rd Indian to score 10,000 runs in the ODI cricket.

== Early years ==
Born in [[Indore]], Dravid's family relocated to [[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]], where his father worked for Kissan, a company known for [[jams]] and preserves. This lead to him earning the nickname ''Jammy'' from his teammates at [[St. Joseph's Boys' High School|St. Joseph's, Bangalore]]. Dravid first came to prominence whilst attending a summer coaching camp at the [[Chinnaswamy Stadium]] where his talents were spotted by former cricketer Keki Tarapore who was coaching at the clinic {{ref|TIME}}. He went on to score a century on debut for his school team and was selected for the U-15 [[Karnataka cricket team]], scoring a double century against the U-15 [[Kerala cricket team]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Along with the batting, he was keeping wickets. However, he later stopped keeping wickets on advice from former Test players [[Gundappa Vishwanath]], [[Roger Binny]], [[Brijesh Patel]] and Tarapore. He was selected to make his [[Ranji Trophy]] in [[February 1991]] against [[Maharashtra cricket team|Maharashtra]] in [[Pune]] (while still attending college at St.Joseph's College of Commerce in Bangalore), alongside future Indian teammates [[Anil Kumble]] and [[Javagal Srinath]], scoring 82 in a drawn match after batting in the No. 7 position <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1990-91/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/KNOCK-OUTS/MAHA_KNTKA_RJI-PQF2_02-05FEB1991.html</ref>. his first full season was in 1991-92, when he scored two centuries to finish with 380 runs at an average of 63.3 <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1991-92/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RJI_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref>, and was selected for [[South Zone cricket team|South Zone]] in the [[Duleep Trophy]] <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1991-92/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/SQUADS/DULEEP_1991-92_SOUTH-SQUAD.html</ref>, for whom he has been subsequently chosen annually. He had a stronger season in 1992-93, scoring 582 runs at an average of 83.1 including a double century <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1992-93/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RJI_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref> but managed only one game in the Duleep Trophy, scoring 14. In the following year, he had another strong Ranji Trophy scoring 644 runs at an average of 80.5 including two centuries <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1993-94/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RJI_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref> but again had a disappointing Duleep Trophy campaign, averaging just 13. <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1993-94/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref>. However, in the 1994-95 season, Dravid played only once in the Ranji competition, but he scored 191 in his only innings <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1994-95/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RJI_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref> and averaged 52 in the Duleep Trophy <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1994-95/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref>. In the 1995-96 Ranji Trophy season, he scored 153 as captain against [[Hyderabad cricket team|Hyderabad]] in the semi-final <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/KNOCK-OUTS/KNTKA_HYD_RJI-SEMI2_14-18MAR1996.html</ref> to advance to the final, in which he scored another century against [[Tamil Nadu cricket team|Tamil Nadu]] <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/KNOCK-OUTS/TN_KNTKA_RJI-FINAL_27-31MAR1996.html</ref>. In total he scored 460 runs at an average of 57.50 <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RJI_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref> and was the second highest run-scorer in the Duleep Trophy behind [[V. V. S. Laxman]] as well as topping the averages <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/STATS/IND_LOCAL_DULEEP_AVS_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html</ref>. Dravid became a contender for International duties after being selected for the India A team in a domestic tournament in the 1994-95 season <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1994-95/IND_LOCAL/CHLNGR/TRIAL_1994-95_SQUADS.html</ref> and again in the 1995-96 season <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/CHLNGR/CHLNGR-SQUADS_DEC1995.html</ref>, where he top-scored for his team in the match against India B <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/CHLNGR/IND-A_IND-B_CHLNGR_30DEC1995.html</ref> and the final against the senior Indian team <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1995-96/IND_LOCAL/CHLNGR/IND_IND-A_CHLNGR-FINAL_31DEC1995.html</ref>.
However, he was overlooked from the Indian team for the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the Indian subcontinent.

== International career ==
Dravid made his international debut in one-dayers against [[Sri Lankan cricket team ]] in the Singer Cup in the Singers ground in Singapore immediately after the World Cup in March 1996, replacing [[Vinod Kambli]]. After scoring just 21 runs in four matches  <ref>http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=2281;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1996-04-03;start=1996-04-03;enddefault=2006-08-19;end=2006-08-19;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype</ref> , Dravid was dropped during the Sharjah tournament and did not play again until  [[Sanjay Manjrekar]] was  injured on the tour of England <ref>http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1996/IND_IN_ENG/IND_ENG_TEX_ODI3_26-27MAY1996_ET_MR.html</ref>.

With Manjrekar sidelined, he then made his debut in the Second Test against [[English cricket team|England]] along with [[Sourav Ganguly]], scoring 95 {{ref|TIME}}. He held his position on Manjrekar's return for the Third Test, scoring 84 <ref>http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1996/IND_IN_ENG/IND_ENG_T3_04-09JUL1996.html</ref>. After moderate home series against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], Dravid broke through on the 1996-97 tour of South Africa. He batted at No. 3 in the third Test in [[Johannesburg]], scoring his maiden century with 148 and 81, the top score in each innings to claim his first man of the match award {{ref|TIME}}. He also finally made his first half-century against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in the Sahara Cup in 1996, scoring 90 in his 10th ODI <ref>http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1996/OD_TOURNEYS/SAHARA/IND_PAK_SAHARA_ODI2_17SEP1996.html</ref>. 

In the 18 months ending in mid-1998, he played in an away series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], home and away series against Sri Lanka and a home series against Australia, he scored consistently, with 964 runs at an average of 56.7. He scored eleven half-centuries but was unable to convert them to triple figures {{ref|TESTSER}}. He scored his second century in late 1998 against [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in a one-off Test match, top-scoring in both innings with 148 and 44, but was unable to prevent an Indian defeat {{ref|TIME}}. He then became the third Indian batsman after [[Vijay Hazare]] and [[Sunil Gavaskar]] to score centuries in both innings of a match during the 1999 New Year's Test match against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] with 190 and 103* to force a draw {{ref|TIME}}, batting for a total of 653 minutes <ref>http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/IND_IN_NZ/SCORECARDS/IND_NZ_T3_02-06JAN1999.html</ref>. He had a moderate subcontinental season in early 1999, scoring 269 runs at 38.42 with one century before scoring 239 at 39.8 including a century against New Zealand in late 1999{{ref|TESTSER}}. This was followed by a poor away series against Australia and another poor home series against South Africa, accumulating just 187 runs at an average of 18.7. He then scored 200*, his first double century, against Zimbabwe in [[Delhi]] which along with 70* in the second innings helped India to victory. It was the first time he had passed 50 in 12 months and he followed this with a 162 in the following Test, giving him 432 runs in the two match series at an average of 432 {{ref|TIME}}.

== Dravid's style ==
With a strong technique, he has been the backbone for the Indian cricket team. Beginning with the reputation of being a defensive batsman who should be confined to Test cricket, 
he was dropped from ODIs as he was slow in making runs. Of late, however, Rahul Dravid has defied early perceptions to become the mainstay of the Indian batting line-up in ODIs {{Fact|date=February 2007}}as well as in Tests. His nickname of 'The Wall' in [[Reebok]] advertisements has now become a tribute to his consistency. Dravid has scored 23 centuries in [[Test cricket]] at an average of 58.75, including 5 double centuries. In [[One-day International|one-dayers]] though he has an average of 40.05, and a strike rate of 70.70. He is one of the few Indians who average more at away matches than at home, averaging over 10 more runs a match abroad than on Indian pitches. As of 9 August, 2006, Dravid's average in overseas Tests stood at 65.28 as against his overall Test average of 58.75, and his average for away ODI stands at 42.03 as against overall ODI average of 40.05. In matches that India has won, Dravid averages 78.72 in Tests and 53.40 in ODIs.

Dravid's sole Test wicket was that of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test against the West Indies during the 2001-2002 series. While he has no pretensions to being a bowler, Dravid often kept wicket for India in ODIs. He has since delegated the wicket-keeping gloves, first to [[Parthiv Patel]] and more recently to [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]. Dravid is now purely a batsman, one who has averaged 63.51 in matches played since 1 January, 2000.

Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with [[Sourav Ganguly]], the first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership, and then a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is the present world record. He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings since debut before being dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270 respectively. Uniquely, each of his five double centuries in Tests was a higher score than his previous double century (200*, 217, 222, 233, 270).

Also, Dravid is the current world record holder for the highest percentage(%) contribution of runs scored in matches won under a single captain, where the captain has won more than 20 Tests. <ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/221152.html</ref> In the 21 Test matches India won under [[Sourav Ganguly]]'s leadership, Dravid played his part in every single one of those wins, scoring at a record average of 102.84 and piling up an astonishing 2571 runs, with nine hundreds - three of them double-centuries - and ten fifties in 32 innings. He contributed nearly 23% of the total runs scored by India those 21 matches, which is almost one run out of every four runs the team scored. 

[[Image:Rahul Dravid Graph.png|left|thumb|350px|Rahul Dravid's career performance graph.]]
He was named one of the [[Wisden]] cricketers of the year [[2000]].

In 2004, Dravid was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] by the [[Government of India]]. On [[7 September]], 2004, he was awarded the inaugural [[Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy|Player of the year award]] and the [[ICC Awards|Test player of the year]] by the [[International Cricket Council]], ICC (associated image below). Dravid's batting average of 95.46 in the past year has made him the only [[India]]n to be in the [[Test team of the year]]. On 18th March, 2006, Dravid played his 100th Test against England in [[Mumbai]].

In 2005, a biography of Rahul Dravid written by [[Devendra Prabhudesai]] was published, 'The Nice Guy Who Finished First'.

In the 2005 ICC Awards he was the only Indian to be named to the World one-day XI.

In [[2006]], it was announced that he would remain captain of the Indian team up to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] in the [[West Indies]].

However he is infamous for deliberately keeping out former skipper Sourav Ganguly from Indian squad in conjunction with current coach Greg Chappell with whom Ganguly had a much publicised spat.

==Personal Records==
===Tests===
* Dravid has the second highest Test batting average among those who have scored over 8,000 Test runs. (September 2006) <ref>http://usa.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/TEST_BAT_HIGHEST_AVS.html</ref>
* Scored nearly 23% of the total runs put up by India (with a batting average of 102.84) in the 21 Test matches won under Ganguly's captaincy. This is the highest percentage contribution by any batsman in Test cricket history in matches won under a single captain where the captain has won more than 20 Tests.<ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/221152.html</ref>
* Longest streak of consecutive Tests since debut (96)
* Only player to score a century against every Test playing nation away from home (until the ICC decides to add more nations to the list of Test playing nations his record can only be equalled, not broken).<ref>http://www.cricketzone.com/news/columns/20060710-0.html</ref>
* Involved in highest partnership made away from home for any wicket for India with vice captain [[Virender Sehwag]] of 410 runs vs Pakistan at Lahore in 2006 (the highest partnership between a captain and the vice captain).

* Dravid is one among the only three batsmen to hit Test centuries in four consecutive innings. The other two are Jack Fingleton and Alan Melville. Dravid achieved this by hitting scores of 115, 148, 217 and 100* in three successive matches against England and one against the West Indies. Only Everton Weekes, with centuries in five consecutive innings, has achieved a longer sequence of consecutive Test hundreds.
* With scores of 50 or more in 7 consecutive Tests Dravid bettered the previous Indian record of 50+ scores in 6 consecutive Tests for a single batsman. This record was shared by [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Chandu Borde]], [[Sunil Gavaskar]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and [[Sadagoppan Ramesh]]. As of [[October]] [[2006]] this streak is unbroken.
* He is currently joint 4th along with Brian Lara among batsmen who have scored most away runs in Tests (5288 as of August 9th 2006). Only [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Allan Border]] and [[Vivian Richards]] have scored more away Test runs.
*9th batsman to score twin hundreds in a Test twice, and only the 2nd Indian to do so, after Sunil Gavakar.
*1st Indian to score 5 double hundreds, each bigger than the previous.

==Captaincy==
===Achievements===
* Rahul Dravid led India to a historic Test series win, against the West Indies in their home soil in 2006. Since 1971, India had never won a Test series in the West Indies. This is also their first prominent series win outside the Indian subcontinent (barring the win against Zimbabwe in 2005) since 1986.
* Under Dravid's captaincy the Indian team tied the previous record of most consecutive One-Day International wins for an Indian team thus equalling the record run that the Indian team had achieved under Sourav Ganguly in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa (8).
* During his captaincy the Indian team broke the 14 match West Indies record for most consecutive won matches in One-Day Internationals while chasing a total. For this 17 match run, Dravid was the captain for 15 matches and [[Sourav Ganguly]] was the captain for the other two. This streak was broken on 5/20/06, when India lost to the West Indies by one run, at Sabina Park, Jamaica.
*Rahul Dravid is the first captain to lead india to victory against SA in south african soil

===Criticism===
* One of Dravid's most debated decisions was taken in March 2004, when he was standing in as captain for an injured [[Sourav Ganguly]]. The Indian first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 with 16 overs remaining on Day 2.  <ref>http://www.hindu.com/2004/04/30/stories/2004043000932100.htm</ref>  
* Rahul Dravid has had a mixed record when leading India in Tests. India lost the Karachi Test in 2006, giving Pakistan the series 1-0. In March 2006, India lost the Mumbai Test, giving England its first Test victory in India since 1985, enabling Flintoff's men to draw the series 1-1. While the loss in Karachi could be put down to several Indian batsmen playing badly, the defeat in Mumbai was arguably the result of Dravid's decision to bowl first on a flat dry pitch which later deteriorated and ended with an Indian collapse in the run chase. <ref>http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indveng/content/current/story/241706.html</ref>
* After India failed to qualify for the Finals of the DLF Cup, Indian skipper Rahul Dravid was criticised by former all-rounder [[Ravi Shastri]] who said that he was not assertive enough and let Greg Chappell make too many decisions<ref>http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/25/stories/2006092509681900.htm</ref>. When asked for a response, Dravid said that Shastri, while a 'fair critic', was 'not privy' to the internal decision-making process of the team <ref>http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=328034&ssid=88&sid=SPO</ref>.
