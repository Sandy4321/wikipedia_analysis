== Reviews ==
'''Digitalspy.co.uk''' gave the song 4 out of 5 stars and a very positive review. They started by talking about Lady Sovereign but eventually went onto talking about the song by saying "it's a perky urban pop tune about having bad days and not beating yourself up about it. Sovereign remains as straight-talking and listenable as ever - "I need a bag of green to make this go away," she raps at one point - making this a welcome reminder of her talents".<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a150300/lady-sovereign-so-human.html</ref>

'''Orange UK''' gave the song 4 out of 5 stars and gave a positive review and welcomed Lady Sovereign back onto the music scene. They said that "'So Human' sees Sovereign applying her no-nonsense straight-talking wit to one of British pop's most prized possessions. The result is a perky, poppy urban track that just about sidesteps novelty territory and is all the better for it. Welcome home m'Lady".<ref>http://web.orange.co.uk/article/lady-sovereign-so-human</ref>

== Controversy ==
Lady Sovereign's single "So Human" is causing controversy in the underground music scene due to its gratuitous use of [[The Cure]]'s song "[[Close to Me (The Cure song)|Close To Me]]". Another underground MC/soul singer Thomas Jules had already cleared use of the melody with Robert Smith, and the idea of using The Cure song as a backing track was pushed onto Lady Sovereign by Island Records after executives heard Thomas Jules perform his track "Get Close To Me" at a live showcase.  Robert Smith has since gone on record saying he prefers the Thomas Jules version of the track. The track will be included in Lady Sovereign's upcoming album.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/thomasjulessongs] Thomas Jules Myspace - Interview with Robert Smith </ref>

== Music video ==
The video starts off with Sovereign standing infront off a white wall with a splash of yellow paint on it. Then it goes to Sovereign on the red carpet being interviewed, after the paparazzi take many pictures of her a model walks on and tries to steal the spotlight so she trips her over. She then steals a camera of the paparazzi and throws it away from him. She then appears on two magazine covers one called "Crazed" and another called "Any Other Magazine". She then appears on a couch with a psychiatrist sitting next to her and she takes notes on everything Sovereign says. the psychiatrist eventually breaks down in tears and hugs SOvereign. She then appears on two new magazines one called "Vague" and the other called "Spender". She then talks to a guy who is veiwing art at a gallary and then she walks off because he bores her. When she walks off she lets her friends sneak in and they have a party. She then ends it by going everywhere she has already been in the video and the person next to her mimes the words off the song.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dYxu2QVlpk</ref> The video was released on YouTube on [[February 23]] [[2009]] and has been viewed 149,777 times and has been rated 4 and a half stars out of 5.
