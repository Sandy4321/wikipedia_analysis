'''Karl von Ditmar''' (sometimes ''Carl von Ditmar'')<ref name="VIAF"/> (1822-1892) was a [[Baltic German]] [[geologist]] and [[explorer]], who travelled in and contributed to the scientific understanding of [[Kamchatka]].

==Life and work==
Karl von Ditmar was born in [[V<U+00E4>ndra]], present-day [[Estonia]] as the son of jurist Woldemar Friedrich Carl Ditmar and Charlotte Ditmar, n<U+00E9>e Stackelberg. He studied at the [[University of Tartu]] in 1841-1847, where he befriended [[Leopold von Schrenck]] and [[Karl Maximovich]], as well as [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]. Ditmar began studying agricultural science but after some time changed to [[mineralogy]] and [[geology]] under [[Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich]] and [[Hermann Martin Asmuss]]. After having graduated university with a [[master's degree]], Ditmar in 1846-1848 travelled Europe and among other things attended lectures at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg Mining Academy]] in present-day Germany. In 1848 he returned to Russia and [[St. Petersburg]], and through his friendship with Leopold von Schrenck was introduced to [[Alexander von Middendorff]] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="kronotsky">{{cite web |url= http://kronoki.org/territories/reserve/history/faces/125|title= Carl Ditmar (Woldemar Friedrich Carl von Ditmar)|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= Kronotsky Reserve|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>

In 1851 Ditmar undertook a voyage to [[Kamchatka]] which would last until 1854, and there undertook important scientific investigations. His account of the travels in Kamchatka, published first in 1890, is still used by scientists involved in studies of Kamchatka.<ref name="kronotsky"/><ref name="cambridge">{{cite web |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=162977|title= Cambridge Journals Online - Polar Record - Abstract - Carl von Ditmar, 1822-192:a geologist in Kamchatka|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>
