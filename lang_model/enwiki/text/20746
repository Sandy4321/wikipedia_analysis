'''King Wen''' (Chinese: <U+5468><U+6587><U+738B>, pinyin: zhou1 wen2 wang2) ([[1099 BC|1099]]<U+2013>[[1050 BC]]) was the founder of the later [[Zhou Dynasty]] (<U+5468><U+671D>).

The Zhou state was located in the Wei River valley in present day [[Shaanxi]] Province (<U+965D><U+897F>). King Wen planned the conquest of the current dynasty in power, the [[Shang Dynasty]] (<U+5546><U+671D>), but he died before he could accomplish this.

His family name was Ji (<U+59EC>). He married TaiSi (<U+592A><U+59D2>) and had at least two sons, [[Zhou Gong Dan]] (<U+5468><U+516C><U+65E6>) and Zhou Gong Wu (<U+5468><U+516C><U+6B66>). His second son became [[King Wu of Zhou]] (<U+5468><U+6B66><U+738B>) and completed his fathers wishes by defeating the Shang army at their capital. He eventually became the first king of the new Zhou dynasty. 

King Wen is also known for his contributions to the [[Classic of Changes|Yi Jing]] (<U+6613><U+7D93>), a manual of divination based on the eight trigrams (<U+516B><U+5366>)<!--<U+8A69><U+7D93> [[Shi Jing]], the Book of Poetry-->, one of the [[Five Classics]] (<U+4E94><U+7D93>, Wu Jing).
