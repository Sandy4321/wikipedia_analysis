'''Florence Ada Fuller''' (1867 <U+2013> 17 July 1946) was a South African-born Australian artist. Originally from [[Port Elizabeth]], Fuller migrated as a child to Melbourne with her family. There she trained with her uncle [[Robert Hawker Dowling]] and teacher [[Jane Sutherland]] and took classes at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]], becoming a professional artist in the late 1880s. In 1892 she left Australia, travelling first to South Africa, where she met and painted for [[Cecil Rhodes]], and then on to Europe. She lived and studied there for the subsequent decade, apart from a return to South Africa in 1899 to paint [[Rhodes]]' portrait. Between 1895 and 1904 her works were exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] and London's [[Royal Academy]].

In 1904, Fuller returned to Australia, living in Perth. She became active in the [[Theosophical Society]] and painted some of her best-known works, including ''The Golden Hour'', described by the National Gallery of Australia as a "masterpiece"<ref name="Gray2013">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Ann|year=2013|title=Masterpieces for the nation 2013.

Beginning in 1908, Fuller travelled extensively, living in India and England before ultimately settling in Sydney. There, she was the inaugural teacher of [[figure drawing|life drawing]] at the School of Fine and Applied Arts established in 1920 by the New South Wales Society of Women Painters. She died in 1946.

Highly regarded in her lifetime as a portrait and landscape painter, by 1914 Fuller was represented in four public galleries<U+2014>three in Australia and one in South Africa<U+2014>a record for an Australian female painter at that time. She subsequently sank into obscurity and is frequently omitted from reference works on Australian artists. Her paintings are held in public art collections including the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and Australia's [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]].

==Early life and career==
Florence Fuller was born in [[Port Elizabeth]], South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa{{#tag:ref|The only source that identifies the name of John Hobson Fuller's wife is a newspaper notice pertaining to another of their daughters, Lily Vines Fuller.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7438667 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1957)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=9 May 1876 |accessdate=8 November 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>|group=notes}} and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters [[Amy Fuller (singer)|Amy]] and [[Christie Fuller|Christie]], both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of [[Jane Sutherland]],<ref name="DAAOKerr">{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/florence-fuller/biography/?|title=Florence Fuller <U+2013> biography|last=Kerr|first=Joan|year=1995|publisher=Design and Art Australia Online|accessdate=4 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112134557/http://www.daao.org.au/bio/florence-fuller/biography/|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> referred to in the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] as "the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature".<ref name="ADBSutherland">{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/sutherland-jane-8718|title=Sutherland, Jane (1853<U+2013>1928)|last=Lindsay|first=Frances|year=1990|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>

Fuller's uncle was [[Robert Hawker Dowling]], a painter of [[orientalism|orientalist]] and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age 30. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the [[Royal Academy]]. He returned to Australia in 1885,<ref name="ADBDowling">{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dowling-robert-hawker-3437|title=Dowling, Robert Hawker (1827<U+2013>1886)|last=Mead|first=Isabella J.|year=1972|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> and Fuller became his pupil.

In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

Fuller painted other works for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece reflecting on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:<blockquote>Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, and he was a constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase&nbsp;... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.<ref name=Perth1937>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41442232 |title=Painters of Perth|newspaper=[[Perth Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=23 October 1937 |accessdate=8 November 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref></blockquote>

==Theosophy and later career==
Biographer Joan Kerr speculated that it may have been Jane Sutherland who introduced Fuller to [[Theosophy]], a spiritual and [[mysticism|mystical]] philosophy that teaches the unity of existence and emphasises the search for universal wisdom. Described by art historian Jenny McFarlane as "the most important counter-cultural organisation of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries", it was influential throughout Fuller's life.<ref name="McFarlane">{{cite journal|last=McFarlane|first=Jenny|date=2004|title=Unauthorised visions|journal=Australian Cultural History|volume=23|pages=43<U+2013>58}}</ref> She joined the society in Perth on 29 May 1905, after hearing charismatic theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] during his lecture tour. Feminist [[Bessie Rischbieth]] joined at the same time, and together they influenced the movement's development in early twentieth century Perth.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Fuller was variously secretary, treasurer and librarian of the local branch of the [[Theosophical Society]].<ref name="DAAOKerr"/> 

In 1906 Fuller's portrait of feminist and theosophist [[Annie Besant]] was among the paintings exhibited at the West Australian Art Society's annual exhibition.<ref name="Western Australian Art Society">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38817906 |title=Western Australian Art Society |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail (Perth, WA : 1885 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=13 October 1906 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Around the same period, she painted other portraits of the movement's leading figures, including [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]. These representations departed from the academic portraiture in which Fuller had trained, as she incorporated practices of intuition and visualisation "inspired by Indian aesthetics as mediated by the Theosophical Society".<ref name=McFarlane/>

In 1907, Besant became the president of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], in what was then [[Madras]].<ref name="Perkins">{{cite book|last=Perkins|first=James S.|title=Adyar <U+2013> the International Headquarters of the Theosophical Society|publisher=The Theosophical Publishing House|location=Adyar, Madras|year=1965|pages=2, 19}}</ref> When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77336940 |title=Mainly about people |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 <U+2013> 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=11 March 1908 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |page=4: Third edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Some months later in 1908,{{#tag:ref|Gray's 2011 biographical notes on Fuller state that she was in Perth until 1908.<ref name=GrayWest/> Kerr's 1995 biographical profile gives the year 1909.<ref name="DAAOKerr"/> Newspaper reports from the period state that she was farewelled by the members of the Theosophical Society on 30 July 1908 prior to a 4 August departure,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28847886 |title=Personal |newspaper=[[Perth Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=1 August 1908 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> but travelled first to Melbourne<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77338645 |title=Mainly about people |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 <U+2013> 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=4 August 1908 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |page=3: Second edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and then back again through Perth in September 1908,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76818666 |title=Mainly about people |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 <U+2013> 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=19 September 1908 |accessdate=7 November 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> before setting out for the subcontinent.|group=notes}} Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar.{{#tag:ref|Both Kerr's biographical note and Gray's subsequent profile that cites Kerr refer to Fuller visiting "the Theosophists' Calcutta headquarters, Adyar".<ref name="DAAOKerr"/> Fuller certainly visited the Theosophist headquarters;<ref name=Matters/> however, Adyar is not in Calcutta.|group=notes}} Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:<blockquote>I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists<U+2014>but of something deeper<U+2014>something less easily expressed. I spent two and a half years in a community that is quite unique<U+2014>perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world<U+2014>the headquarters of the Theosophical Society&nbsp;... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.<ref name=Matters/></blockquote>

Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterwards he "discovered" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti; Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and ''Portrait of the Lord Buddha''.<ref name=McFarlane/> McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is "strikingly modern" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Roland Wakelin]] half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject "through a psychic, visionary experience".<ref name=McFarlane/>

Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India are sometimes ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the [[suffragette]] protests associated with the coronation of [[George V]].<ref name=McFarlane/><ref name="Matters">{{cite book|last=Matters|first=Mrs Leonard W.|title=Australasians Who Count in London and Who Counts in Western Australia|publisher=Jas. Truscott and Son|location=London|year=1913|page=51}}</ref> She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:<blockquote>I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful<U+2014>though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.<ref name=Matters/></blockquote>
Fuller subsequently travelled from London to India in 1914.<ref name=Feb14/> One newspaper report described her as a "visitor" to Sydney in 1916,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15648315 |title=A visiting artist |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=22 March 1916 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> though McFarlane says she travelled there with Leadbeater and remained in the city.<ref name=McFarlane/> Another report stated that she visited Brisbane a year later.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20167387 |title=Woman's world |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864 <U+2013> 1933)]] |location=Qld. |date=13 March 1917 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Both newspaper pieces indicated that Fuller had spent a period painting in [[Java]] (at that time part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]), though when this occurred is not clear, and such a visit is not mentioned by McFarlane. There was at least one subsequent substantial journey, as Fuller arrived again to Sydney, via Perth, from India in 1919.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81343177 |title=Mainly About People. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News (Perth, WA : 1882 <U+2013> 1950)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=2 October 1919 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=3: Third edition |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58008480 |title=Perth Prattle. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times (Perth, WA : 1902 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=28 September 1919 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=6 Section: Second Section |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At some point following these travels, Fuller settled permanently in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]] in Sydney's northern suburbs, where she continued to paint, including [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]].<ref name="McCulloch448"/> Her 1916 visit to Sydney had included an exhibition of a group of her miniatures, all of them portraits of theosophists including Besant and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]], co-founder of the Theosophical Society.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125913825 |title=Women Painters. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Stock and Station Journal|The Sydney Stock and Station Journal (NSW : 1896 <U+2013> 1924)]] |location=NSW |date=17 March 1916 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1920, the Society of Women Painters in New South Wales established a School of Fine and Applied Arts, with Florence Fuller appointed as the inaugural teacher of [[figure drawing|life classes]]. At the exhibition held to mark the School's establishment, Fuller displayed a portrait of the organisation's founder, Mrs Hedley Parsons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120519118 |title=Women Painters. |newspaper=[[Sunday Times|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 <U+2013> 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=4 July 1920 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> When the Society held a show in 1926, a portrait by Fuller was one of those selected for favourable comment, but the general opinion of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewer was that "the exhibitors have let their style harden into a groove".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16289365 |title=Women painters |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=30 April 1926 |accessdate=6 November 2013 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Fuller continued to be associated with the theosophical community, however her health and economic circumstances deteriorated.

She was buried at [[Rookwood Cemetery]].<ref name="DAAOKerr"/>

==Style and legacy==
Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, in their ''Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists'', considered Fuller's art to be created in "a free painterly style indebted to [[Impressionism]]".<ref name="Smith">{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Gwenda|coauthors=Elaine Smith|title=Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists|editor=Robert Smith|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Melbourne, Vic.|year=1993|page=95|chapter=Florence Fuller|isbn=0-522-84478-2}}</ref> During the first decade of the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the ''[[Adelaide Advertiser]]'''s correspondent described Fuller's contribution as "most Australian in feeling".<ref name=Aug02/> Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows a young girl in thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country&nbsp;... As the London ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat".<ref name=Sep04/> One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:<blockquote>She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never could she bring herself to see our trees as dim coloured as they usually are.<ref name=Perth1937/></blockquote>
Art critic and curator Jenny McFarlane considered Fuller's work to be complex, drawing not only on European [[modernism|modernist]] academic traditions and Australian subjects, but also at times incorporating "radical stylistic innovations" that drew on Indian artistic tradition and theosophy's ideas.<ref name=McFarlane/>

Reviewing the Western Australian Art Society's exhibition in 1906, the critic for Perth's ''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]]'' considered Fuller's works to be the finest on show, and that "the occasion provides another triumph for Miss Fuller".<ref name="Western Australian Art Society"/> In 1914, it was reported that Fuller was represented in four public galleries<U+2014>three in Australia and one in South Africa<U+2014>a record for an Australian female painter at that time.<ref name=Feb14/> Yet although she experienced considerable success during her early life, Fuller subsequently became almost invisible. No obituaries appeared in the newspapers in 1946. She is not mentioned at all in Janine Burke's ''Australian Women Artists 1840<U+2013>1940'', Max Germaine's ''Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia'', or Caroline Ambrus's ''Australian Women Artists''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Janine|title=Australian Women Artists 1840<U+2013>1940|publisher=Greenhouse Publications|location=Collingwood, Vic.|year=1980|isbn=0-909104-30-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Germaine|first=Max|title=A Dictionary of Women Artists of Australia|publisher=Craftsman House|location=Roseville East, NSW|year=1991|isbn=976-8097-13-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ambrus|first=Caroline|title=Australian Women Artists: First Fleet to 1945|publisher=Irrepressible Press|location=Woden, ACT|year=1992|isbn=0-646-09513-7}}</ref> Despite this, in 2013, Ann Gray described Fuller as "an important Australian woman artist and arguably Western Australia's most significant artist from the Federation period".<ref name="Gray2013"/> Works by Fuller are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia,<ref name="FullerAGSA"/> the Art Gallery of Western Australia,<ref name="FullerAGWA">{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.wa.gov.au/events_programs/documents/1800-1920DiscoverySheet.pdf|title=Sand pies (1893)|last=Fuller|first=Florence|year=purchased 1904|work=Children's Discovery Sheet <U+2013> Your Collection 1800 to 1920|publisher=Art Gallery of Western Australia|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=William|title=The Story of Australian Art|publisher=Angus & Robertson Publishers|location=Sydney, NSW|year=1934|volume=1|page=201}}</ref> the [[National Gallery of Australia]],<ref name="Gray2013"/> the City of Perth,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perth.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/PerspectivesTownHallCatalogue_p5.pdf|title=Perspectives in Time: An exhibition of historic artworks depicting the transition of Perth from colony to city|year=2005|publisher=City of Perth|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref> the [[National Gallery of Victoria]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/5612|title=A French peasant (1894<U+2013>1899) |last=Fuller|first=Florence|date=purchased 1972|work=Collection|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref> Australia's [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery]]<ref name="NPG"/> and the State Library of Victoria.<ref name="Cowen"/> Internationally, her work is held by the [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum and Art Gallery]] in South Wales.<ref name="Newport">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/blue-mountains-new-south-wales-australia-156331|title=Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia|year=2013|work=Your paintings: uncovering the nation's art collection|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref>
