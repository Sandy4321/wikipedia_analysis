'''Kasper Risg<U+00E5>rd''' (born [[January 4]], [[1983]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[football (soccer)]] [[Defender (football)|defender]] and [[midfielder]], who currently plays for [[Danish Superliga]] side [[Aalborg Boldspilklub]] (AaB). 

Risg<U+00E5>rd was introduced to top flight football late in the [[Danish Superliga 2002-03|2002-03 season]] when AaB surprisingly found themselves struggling in the bottom of the table. Risg<U+00E5>rd made some fine displays, including a goal in the [[DONG Cup]] semifinal against [[Br<U+00F8>ndby IF]] and a vital winner against [[K<U+00F8>ge BK]]. 

During the next seasons Risg<U+00E5>rd fell further away from the team and was eventually loaned out to local rivals [[FC Nordjylland]]. When he returned to AaB he remained a substitute but due to many injuries, Risg<U+00E5>rd got a new chance as central defender in the end of the [[Danish Superliga 2005-06|2005-06 season]], where he played well for half a year before being moved once again in the fall of 2007. This time Aalborg BK coach [[Erik Hamr<U+00E9>n]] moved him to a position as a defensive midfielder, where he proved himself an important first team player. Due to a series of impressive performances as a defensive midfielder in both the [[Danish Superliga]] and the [[UEFA Cup]] Danish national coach [[Morten Olsen]] brought him into the Danish national league squad.
