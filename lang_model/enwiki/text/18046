Founded in 1837, Auburn High School is one of the oldest [[secondary school]]s in Alabama.<ref>United States Bureau of Education, ''Annual report of the Commissioner of Education for the year ended 1902'' (Washington: G.P.O., 1902); Mollie Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'' (S.l.: s.n., 1955), 72. Auburn High School is likely the oldest secondary school in the state; the 1902 report gives an 1843 date for the founding, which for existing schools, is preceded in that report only by the Marion Military Institute.  As the 1843 date likely recognizes the school's first secondary/collegiate program, not its founding, Hollifield's 1837 date would make Auburn High the oldest.</ref> From 1843 through 1888, the school was known as the '''Auburn Female College''', offering secondary and, prior to 1870, collegiate degrees.<ref>United States Bureau of Education, ''Annual report of the Commissioner of Education for the year ended 1902''; United States Bureau of Education, ''Report of the Commissioner of Education made to the Secretary of the Interior for the year 1890, with accompanying papers'' (Washington: G.P.O., 1890).</ref>  From 1892 through 1908, the school was named the '''Auburn Female Institute''', and offered collegiate programs equivalent to an [[associates degree]].<ref>Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 73; Auburn High School, ''Auburn High School Catalogue, Session 1908&ndash;1909'' (Auburn: The Auburn High School, 1908).</ref>  Auburn High became [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]'s flagship high school in 1914 as '''Lee County High School''', and gained its present name, Auburn High School, in 1956.<ref>Mickey Logue and Jack Simms, ''Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village'' (Auburn: s.n., 1996), 98; ''Lee County Bulletin'', August 30, 1956.</ref>  The school moved to its current 36-acre (0.14&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) campus in 1965.<ref>Alabama, Dept. of Education, ''Report of a partial survey of the Auburn City School System, 1977&ndash;78'', (SG023316&ndash;23331, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, 1978).</ref>

===Beginnings===

Auburn High was originally started as a [[Private school|private]] frontier school in 1837, less than three years after the Auburn area had been opened to settlement.<ref>''Columbus Enquirer'', February 22, 1838; William W. Rogers et al., ''Alabama: The History of a Deep South State'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1994), 90&ndash;91, 138; John Peavy Wright, ''Glimpses into the Past from My Grandfather's Trunk'' (Alexander City, Ala.: Outlook Publishing Company, 1969), 4; Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 72.</ref> A two-story frame school building was constructed in 1838, and in the early [[1840s]] a separate male academy had been spun off of the school.<ref>Mary Reese Frazer, ''Early History of Auburn'' (S.l.: s.n., 1920), 3; Ann Pearson, "Sweet Auburn! Loveliest Village of the Plain" in Alexander Nunn, ed., ''Lee County and Her Forebears'' (Montgomery: Herff Jones, 1983), 61; Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 72.</ref>  In 1843, the remaining school was named the "Auburn Female College".<ref>Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 61; United States Bureau of Education, ''Annual report of the Commissioner of Education for the year ended 1902'' (Washington: G.P.O., 1902).</ref> 

The Auburn Female College attracted hundreds of boarding students to Auburn in the [[1840s]] and [[1850s]] largely because it offered a complete secondary education to women&mdash;including ancient and modern languages, literature, mathematics, and musical arts&mdash;at the same academic level of that given to men.<ref>''South-Western Baptist'', May 3, 1855; Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 73; Minnie Clare Boyd, ''Alabama in the Fifties'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1931), 138.</ref> The school received a legislative charter as a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] school in 1852, becoming the "Auburn Masonic Female College".<ref>"Ratifying Incorporation of Masonic Female College", ''Alabama Historical Quarterly'' 18 (Summer 1956), 150&ndash;151.</ref>

During the 1850s, the school physical plant was expanded to three buildings: a main building, a music building, and a chapel which included the largest auditorium in eastern Alabama and a fully equipped chemistry laboratory.<ref>Leland Cooper, ''The Early History of Auburn'', Thesis (Auburn: s.n., 1907), 5 ; Logue and Simms, ''Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village'', 16; ''Tuskegee Republican'', April 17, 1859; Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 73; Henry Barnard, ''School architecture; or Contributions to the improvement of school-houses in the United States'' (New York: A. S. Barnes & Co., 1848), 332.</ref>  By 1855, the school enrolled 110 students.<ref>''List of Colleges, Academics and Common Schools, 1855'', Macon County Archives.</ref> Faculty members included [[John M. Darby]], a scientist who wrote his own textbooks for his students, including a ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0FE97wVHmDZysv3jynK&id=CKAIAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage Textbook of Chemistry]'' and ''Botany of the Southern States'', which was the earliest compilation of [[flora]] in the [[Southern United States]], and [[William P. Harrison]], a [[Methodist]] [[theology|theologian]] who was eventually appointed [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives]].<ref>Frazer, ''Early History of Auburn'', 3; Wright, ''Glimpses into the Past from My Grandfather's Trunk'', 32; John Darby, ''Text book of Chemistry, Theoretical and Practical'' (New York: A.S. Barnes and Co., 1860); John Darby, ''Botany of the Southern States in two parts'' (New York: A.S. Barnes and Co., 1855); Harold Lawrence, ed., ''Methodist Preachers in Georgia'' (Tignall, Ga.: Boyd Publishing, 1984), 234.</ref> The school offered a broad selection of language offerings, with students in 1861 offered classes in Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, German, and  Italian.<ref>''Tallapoosa Times'', January 3, 1861.</ref>  The Auburn Masonic Female College also hosted speakers and debates among some of the region's greatest luminaries, most notably an 1860 debate over [[secession]] which included [[William Lowndes Yancey]], [[Alexander Stephens]], [[Benjamin Harvey Hill]], and [[Robert Toombs]].<ref>Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 12&ndash;14.</ref>

The Masons relinquished control of the school to a shared board of trustees with the [[Auburn University|East Alabama Male College]] in the late [[1850s]], and in the early [[1860s]], the school began admitting boys to the secondary division.<ref>Cooper, ''The Early History of Auburn'' 5; I.M.E. Blandin, ''History of Higher Education of Women in the South prior to 1860'' (New York: Neale Publishing, 1909), 105.</ref> When the [[U.S. Civil War]] began in 1861, virtually the entire male junior and senior classes of the school, as well as much of the faculty joined [[Confederate States of America]] military units, particularly, the 37th Alabama Regiment.<ref>Hollifield, ''Auburn: Lovliest Village of the Plain'', 78&ndash;79.</ref>  As the "principal teacher", W.F. Slaton, was also a major in the regiment, classes in Auburn stopped for the remainder of the war.  The regiment was captured at [[Battle of Corinth II|Corinth, Mississippi]], and exiled to the [[Johnson's Island]] prisoner of war camp on [[Lake Erie]].  While imprisoned there, Slaton held the school's classes in the camp.  Notably, the [[African American]] [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] guards, who were prohibited by law from attending school in their native [[Wisconsin]], were invited to join the classes, making Auburn High one of the first [[Southern United States|Southern]] schools to [[Racial integration|integrate]], some 90&nbsp;years before [[Brown v. Board]].<ref>C.C.

When the war ended, students and teachers returned back to Auburn, but economic hardships in the aftermath of the war and [[Reconstruction]] left the school closed through the rest of the decade.<ref>Blandin, ''History of Higher Education of Women in the South prior to 1860'', 106; Pearson, "Sweet Auburn!

===From private college to public high school===

Around 1870, the school reopened in the building formerly occupied by the male academy.<ref>Blandin, ''History of Higher Education of Women in the South prior to 1860'', 106; Willis Brewer, ''Alabama, Her History, Resources, War Record, and Public Men: from 1540 to 1872'' (Montgomery: Barrett & Brown, 1872), 316; East Alabama Male College Board of Trustees, ''Board Minutes'', July 12&ndash;13, 1869.</ref>  The school retained the name "Auburn Female College", despite admitting both boys and girls.<ref>Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College Board of Trustees, ''Board Minutes'', June 25, 1878.</ref>

State funding for the school was practically non-existent until the late [[1870s]], and the town's economic condition was poor, making it difficult to support the school.<ref>Willis G. Clark, ''History of Education in Alabama, 1702&ndash;1889'' (Washington: G.P.O., 1889), 242&ndash;248;  Pearson, "Sweet Auburn! Loveliest Village of the Plain", 72&ndash;73.</ref> Nonetheless, in 1885, a separate town-funded public school system for Auburn was created, and the previously private Auburn Female College became the public "Auburn High School", although tuition was still charged.<ref>''Acts of Alabama, 1884'', Act 398; R.W. Burton, ''Annual Report of Joseph A. Holifield, Pres. Bd. of Education, Auburn Dist. Alabama for Scholastic Year Ending September 30, 1886''.</ref> While this new public funding allowed the school to remain open much longer than before&mdash;200&nbsp;days in 1886&mdash;enrollment was significantly lower than it was prior to the Civil War, with an 1889 report listing Auburn High School as enrolling fewer than 20 students.<ref>United States Bureau of Education, ''Report of the Commissioner of Education made to the Secretary of the Interior for the year 1890, with accompanying papers''.</ref> 

In 1892, [[Auburn University]] (then the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College) decided to [[coeducation|admit women]].  However, since the college only admitted women with junior standing, Auburn High added three more years of classes beyond the secondary level (equivalent to freshman and sophomore college classes) for women.  With this addition, the name of the school was yet again changed to the "Auburn Female Institute".<ref>Auburn Female Institute, ''Announcement of the Auburn Female Institute, Auburn, Alabama, 1894&ndash;95'' (Opelika, Ala.: R.J. Rice, 1894), 4, 6&ndash;7, 11&ndash;12.</ref>  

In 1899, a new, two-story building was built for Auburn High.<ref>Logue and Simms, ''Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village'', 50.</ref>  In 1908, the school dropped the post-secondary program and became "Auburn High School" once more.<ref>Auburn High School, ''Auburn High School Catalogue, Session 1908&ndash;1909''.</ref> Around 1910, Auburn High fielded its first [[basketball]] team, and by 1915, its first [[football (American)|football]] squad.<ref>''Opelika Daily News'', November 8, 1934.</ref>  

===Modern era===

In 1914, Auburn High became the flagship high school for the county and was officially renamed "Lee County High School", though "Auburn High" remained the common name of the school. That same year, the school relocated from the 1899 building to a new structure on Opelika Road.<ref>Logue and Simms, ''Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village'', 98.</ref>

In the period between 1910 and 1920, Auburn High changed from an academy of the classic 19th-century model, focusing on the traditional Latin course, to a comprehensive high school offering vocational and technical courses in addition to the academic offerings.<ref>Auburn High School, ''Auburn High School Catalogue, Session 1908&ndash;1909''; Alabama Cooperative Extension Service, ''Alabama Cooperative Extension Service Photographs: High School Activities'' (Auburn: ACES, 1925&ndash;1926); Department of Education State of Alabama, ''Annual Report for the Scholastic Year Ending September 30, 1919'' (Montgomery: Brown Printing Co., 1919), 105.</ref> Auburn High added vocational courses to the curriculum in 1918, the eighth high school in the state to implement such a program.<ref>Department of Education State of Alabama, ''Annual Report for the Scholastic Year Ending September 30, 1919'', 105.</ref> Over the next two decades, Auburn High developed its modern extracurricular face, forming band, choir, drama, and other programs, as well as diversifying occupational classes.<ref>''Opelika Daily News'', November 12, 1935; Department of Education, State of Alabama, ''Annual Report for the Scholastic Year Ending September 30, 1919'', 104&ndash;105.</ref> In 1925, Auburn High became one of the first high schools in the state to be accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].<ref>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, ''[http://www.sacscasi.org/schools/Proceedings_Accredited_SACS_CASI_AL.html SACS CASI Accredited Schools]'', retrieved August 7, 2006.</ref> A new school building was constructed in [[1931]], and in 1956, the school was officially renamed Auburn High School again.<ref>Logue and Simms, ''Auburn, A Pictorial History of the Lovliest Village'', 152; ''Lee County Bulletin'', August 30, 1956.</ref>

In 1961, the City of Auburn again created its own school system, with Auburn High as the new district's high school.  In 1966, the school moved to the current campus, organized as a "[[Freedom of Choice (US school desegregation)|Freedom of Choice]]" school designed to promote [[desegregation]].  In 1971, Auburn High merged with nearby Drake High to complete its [[Racial integration|integration]].<ref>Auburn High School, ''Auburn High School Student Handbook, 1994&ndash;1995'' (Auburn: Auburn City Schools, 1994).</ref>   

Five major additions have been made to Auburn High since the original construction in 1966, and in 2004 the school was changed from housing grades 9&ndash;12 to housing grades 10&ndash;12. In 1997, Auburn High added an [[International Baccalaureate]] program, with the first IB diplomas awarded in 1999.<ref>International Baccalaureate Organization, ''[http://www.ibo.org/school/000939/ Auburn High School]'', retrieved January 21, 2007.</ref>

[[Image:Auburn high campus map.png|thumb|left|250px|A map of the Auburn High School campus]]Auburn High is situated on 36&nbsp;acres (0.14&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in the east-central part of Auburn.  The school is designed in a [[modern architecture|modernist style]] on an open campus-style setting, with nine detached buildings separated by outdoor walkways and courtyards spread out over 70% of the campus area.  The campus is located at the corner of Samford Drive and Dean Road, in a residential area.  Adjacent to the campus are the Auburn City Schools central office, Dean Road Elementary School, and Memorial Park Cemetery.  Auburn University is located approximately one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of the school.<ref>City of Auburn, ''[http://gis.auburnalabama.org/website/AuburnIMS/viewer.htm City of Auburn, AL - Geographic Information System], retrieved July 8, 2007.</ref>

The current Auburn High School campus was constructed in 1965, and originally consisted of four buildings; the 100, 200, 300, and 400 buildings.  The 100 building contains the auditorium, cafeteria, and music and vocational classrooms, the 200 and 300 buildings contain academic classrooms including the aquatic biology laboratory (300) and the counselors' offices (200), and the 400 building contains a [[gym]]nasium and athletic facilities.

== Traditions ==
=== Mascot ===
Auburn High's mascot is the [[tiger]].  The tiger was chosen because of its association with Auburn in [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s 1770 poem ''[[The Deserted Village]]''.  The first line of the poem is "Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain", while a later line describes Auburn as, "where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey."

Auburn High's costumed mascot is Samford, an anthropomorphic tiger.  Samford was created in 1995 and named for three symbols of the school: Samford Avenue, which runs by the school; [[Duck Samford Stadium]], Auburn High's football stadium; and [[Samford Hall]], the most prominent building in Auburn.  Kari Pierce was the first Samford in 1995.<ref>Auburn High School, ''The Tiger'', vol. 52.</ref>

=== School songs ===

The Auburn High School "Alma Mater" is Auburn High's [[school song]].  For athletic events, Auburn High uses two [[fight song]]s, "[[Hooray for Auburn!]]"&mdash;the primary fight song&mdash;and "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn". 

====Alma Mater====
{{wikisource|Auburn High School Alma Mater}}
The Auburn High School "Alma Mater" was written in 1955 by band and choral director George Corradino and members of the Auburn High School Glee Club.  It replaced a previous [[alma mater]] of unknown origins.  The "Alma Mater" is used at academic ceremonies and at some athletic events.  A common [[epithet]] for the school used by students and alumni, "dear old Auburn High", is taken from the last line of the song.<ref>Auburn High School, ''The Tiger'', vol. 12 (1956); Auburn High School, ''The Tiger'', vol. 10 (1954).

{{Main|Hooray for Auburn!}}

Auburn High School's primary fight song is "[[Hooray for Auburn!]]".  The lyrics to "Hooray for Auburn!" come from a [[cheer]] that was commonly used in the mid-twentieth century.  In 1961, Auburn High School band director Tommy Goff wrote music to fit those lyrics to create the current fight song.  In subsequent years, the fight song was adopted by other schools, including [[Prattville High School]] and [[Opelika High School]].  At football games, "Hooray for Auburn!" is played after a [[touchdown]].<ref>Auburn High School Band music library, "Hooray for Auburn"; interview with Tommy Goff, 2002; Jimmy White, "Friday pep rally sends team on the road to state", ''Prattville Progress'', December 13, 2006; .  The lyrics to "Hooray for Auburn!" fall into the public domain because they were [[wikisource:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 101#publication|legally published]] within the United States (or the United Nations Headquarters in New York subject to Section 7 of the [[wikisource:United States Headquarters Agreement|United States Headquarters Agreement]]) before 1964, and copyright was not renewed. See also the [http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/~lesk/copyrenew.html Rutgers copyright renewal records] and [http://collections.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals/bin/page?forward=home Stanford Copyright Renewal Database] for further information.  The act of publication occurred when the music and lyrics were offered by the copyright holder to LaFayette High School in 1963.</ref>
 
"Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn"<U+2014>often simply "Glory"<U+2014>was Auburn High's fight song before "Hooray for Auburn!" was written in 1961 and is currently a secondary fight song of Auburn High.  "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn" has the tune of the chorus of the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]", while the lyrics are identical to those of the [[University of Georgia]]'s "[[Glory, Glory]]" but substitute the word "Auburn" for "Georgia". At football games, "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn" is played after a successful [[Point after touchdown|PAT]] conversion.<ref>Interview with Tommy Goff, 2002.  The lyrics to "Glory, Glory to Ole Auburn" fall into the public domain because they are a rewording of the chorus of Amherst's "Marching Song of the Alumni" and Georgia's [[Glory, Glory]] both of which were published prior to 1923. See ''Amherst Graduates' Quarterly'' (1911), p. 15."</ref>
             
{{wikisource|We're Loyal to You, Auburn High}}For the 1955 football season, Auburn High used the [[Auburn University|Alabama Polytechnic Institute]] fight song "[[War Eagle]]".  An earlier school song, "We're Loyal to You, Auburn High", was used from the 1920s through the 1940s.  "We're Loyal to You, Auburn High" has the melody of "[[Illinois Loyalty]]".<ref>Carolyn Jenkins, "Ephemera - Lee County High School", ''Carolyn Jenkins Collection, RG 93'', Auburn University Special Collections and Archives (1927).</ref>
