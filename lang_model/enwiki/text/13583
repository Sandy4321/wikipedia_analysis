'''Hartley Rogers, Jr.''' is a mathematician who has worked in [[recursion theory]], and who is currently a professor in the [[MIT Mathematics Department|Mathematics Department]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  The [[Roger's equivalence theorem|Rogers equivalence theorem]] is named after him.  

Born in 1926, he studied under [[Alonzo Church]] at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and received his Ph.D. there in 1952.  He has served on the MIT faculty since 1956.<ref>[http://www-math.mit.edu/about/history/faculty.html MIT mathematics faculty]</ref>

There he has been involved in many scholarly extracurricular activities, including running SPUR (Summer Program in Undergraduate Research) for MIT undergraduates, overseeing the mathematics section of RSI ([[Research Science Institute]]) for advanced high school students, and coaching the MIT [[Putnam exam]] team for nearly two decades starting in 1990, including the years 2003 and 2004 when MIT won for the first time since 1979. He also runs a seminar called '''[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-S34Fall-2004/CourseHome 18.S34: Mathematical Problem Solving]''' for MIT freshmen.

Rogers is known within the MIT undergraduate community also for having developed a multivariable calculus course ('''[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-022Fall-2005/CourseHome 18.022: Multivariable Calculus with Theory]''') with the explicit goal of providing a firm mathematical foundation for the study of physics. In 2005 he announced that he would no longer be teaching the course himself, but it is likely that it will continue to be taught in a similar manner in the future. He is remembered for his witty mathematical comments during lectures as well as his tradition of awarding [[Leibniz-Keks|Leibniz Cookies]] and [[Fig Newton|Fig Newtons]] to top performers in his class.
