By August&nbsp;1937, four of its eight members had resigned or been fired.]]The '''1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt''' took place from March to June 1937 in [[Alberta]], Canada.  It was a rebellion against Premier [[William Aberhart]] by a group of [[backbencher|backbench]] (not part of the cabinet) Members of the Legislative Assembly ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s) from his [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit League]].  The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with [[C$]]25 monthly dividends through [[social credit]] as he had promised before his 1935&nbsp;election.  When the government's 1937&nbsp;budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a [[confidence vote]].

The revolt took place in a period of turmoil for Aberhart and his government: besides the dissident backbenchers, half of the cabinet resigned or was fired over a period of less than a year.  Aberhart also faced criticism for planning to attend the [[Coronation of George VI of the United Kingdom|coronation of George VI]] at the province's expense and for stifling a [[recall election|recall]] attempt against him by the voters of his constituency.

After a stormy debate in which the survival of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers.  This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit.  Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs.  Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately [[disallowance and reservation|disallowed]] or [[judicial review|struck down]] as unconstitutional.

==Background==

[[File:William Aberhart2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bald, heavyset white man wearing round-rimmed glasses.|William Aberhart won the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 Alberta election]] on the strength of his advocacy of [[social credit]], an economic theory that he said could restore prosperity to the depression-ridden province.]]In the midst of the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]], [[Calgary]] schoolteacher and radio evangelist William Aberhart became a convert to a British economic theory called [[social credit]].  Believing it could end the depression and restore prosperity, he began to promote it around Alberta.  When the provincial government proved resistant to adopting it, Aberhart resolved to field social credit candidates in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 provincial election]].<ref>Barr 71</ref>  These candidates won 56 of the province's 63&nbsp;seats, and Aberhart became [[Premier of Alberta]].<ref>Byrne 111</ref>

In the runup to the campaign, Aberhart promised to increase Albertans' [[purchasing power]] by providing monthly dividends to all citizens in the form of non-negotiable "credit certificates".  While he did not commit to any specific dividend amount, he cited $20 and, later, $25 per month as reasonable figures.<ref>Elliott 110</ref>  Though he noted that these figures were given "only for illustrative purposes", he repeated them so often that, in the assessment of his biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller, "it would have been impossible for any regular listener not to have gained the impression that Aberhart was promising him $25 a month if Social Credit should come to power."<ref>Elliott 157</ref>

Aberhart had been in some conflict with [[C. H. Douglas]], social credit's British originator.  Douglas, while assiduously avoiding specific comment on the Albertan proposals,<ref>Elliott 143</ref> submitted them to his Social Credit Secretariat for review; it found them to be "fallacious from start to finish."<ref>Elliott 128</ref>

By the end of 1936, Aberhart's government had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated.  These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected on the promise of dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through.<ref>Elliott 249</ref>  Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it.  These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises.<ref name="Elliott 251">Elliott 251</ref>  One such MLA, [[S. A. G. Barnes]], had been expelled from the Social Credit [[caucus]] and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.<ref>Elliott 243</ref>

==Genesis==

In December&nbsp;1936, [[John Hargrave]], the leader of the [[Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], visited Alberta.  While he had been disowned by Douglas, many MLAs frustrated with Aberhart saw Hargrave as their saviour.<ref name="Elliott 251"/>  On arrival in Alberta, he met with Aberhart and his cabinet, who told him that the [[Canadian constitution]] (which made banking a matter of federal, rather than provincial, jurisdiction) was an obstacle to their introducing social credit.  Hargrave proposed a plan for implementing social credit in Alberta; while he acknowledged that it was unconstitutional, he believed that the federal government would not dare enforce its jurisdiction in the face of broad popular support for social credit.<ref>Elliott 252</ref>  After he presented his plan to a group of Social Credit MLAs, the news media began to report that Aberhart intended to implement a radical and unconstitutional set of laws.  Aberhart immediately disavowed any "intention of drastic legislation" and, after studying Hargrave's plan, announced that neither he nor his cabinet supported it.<ref name="Elliott 253">Elliott 253</ref>

[[File:Charles Cockroft.jpg|225 px|thumb|right|alt=A balding white man in a three piece suit sits at a desk, pen in hand, with documents laid out before him.|Provincial Treasurer [[Charles Cockroft]]'s January 1937 resignation was among the public's first clues that all was not well in the Aberhart government.]]Despite this statement, the Social Credit caucus invited Hargrave to explain his plan, which he did to the approval of many caucus members.  Attorney-General [[John Hugill]] pointed out that the plan was unconstitutional, to which Hargrave replied that he was "not interested in legal arguments."<ref name="Elliott 253"/>  Two weeks later, Hargrave left the province, telling the press that he "found it impossible to co-operate with a government which [he considered] a mere vacillating machine."<ref name="Elliott 255">Elliott 255</ref>  In this message, some MLAs found confirmation of their misgivings about Aberhart.  A group of them, reported as numbering anywhere from five ("soon joined by eight or ten others")<ref>Elliott 256</ref> to 22,<ref name="Brennan 48">Brennan 48</ref><ref name="Barr 102">Barr 102</ref> began to hold meetings in [[Edmonton]]'s Corona Hotel to, as [[Brian Anthony Brennan|Brian Brennan]] puts it, "plot Aberhart's downfall".<ref name="Brennan 48"/>  Brennan identifies their leader as [[Pembina (provincial electoral district)|Pembina]]'s [[Harry Knowlton Brown]],<ref name="Brennan 48"/> while [[Tim Byrne|T. C. Byrne]] names [[Ronald Ansley]], [[Joseph Unwin]], and [[Albert Blue]].<ref name="Byrne 120">Byrne 120</ref>

To make matters worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines [[Charles Cathmer Ross]] resigned late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer [[Charles Cockroft]] on January&nbsp;29, 1937.  Neither minister's resignation was directly related to the dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy,<ref name="Barr 101">Barr 101</ref> while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health,<ref name="Brennan 49"/> clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council,<ref name="Barr 101"/> government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to [[patronage]].<ref name="Elliott 255"/> Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks.<ref name="Byrne 120"/>  Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry [[William Chant]] would soon follow.<ref name="Barr 101"/>  This left Minister of Health [[Wallace Warren Cross]], Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones [[William Fallow]], and Provincial Secretary [[Ernest Manning]] as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>Brennan 46</ref>  On February&nbsp;19, [[William Carlos Ives]] of the [[Supreme Court of Alberta]] dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half<ref name="Barr 101"/> (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).<ref name="Brennan 49"/>

On February 25, a new session of the legislature opened with the [[speech from the throne]], delivered by Chief Justice [[Horace Harvey]] in the absence of [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Philip Primrose]].<ref>Byrne 119</ref>  Its commitment to social credit was limited to a vaguely worded promise to pursue "a new economic order when social credit becomes effective."<ref name="Brennan 49">Brennan 49</ref>  Three days later, on his weekly radio program, Aberhart acknowledged that he had been unable to implement the monthly dividends during the eighteen month period he had set as his deadline, and asked Social Credit [[constituency association]] presidents to convene meetings of all Social Credit members to decide whether he ought to resign.  He suggested that, in light of poor spring road conditions in rural areas, these meetings be delayed until early June, during which time he would remain in office.<ref name="Elliott 255"/>

==Open dissent==

The media objected to Aberhart's plan to place his government's future in the hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' called for an immediate election.<ref name="Elliott 255"/>  To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives.  This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role.<ref name="MacPherson 170">MacPherson 170</ref>  In the legislature, [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] leader [[David Duggan]] called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.<ref name="Brennan 49"/>

On March 11<ref name="Brennan 49"/> or 12,<ref name="Barr 102"/><ref name="Elliott 257">Elliott 257</ref> Cockroft's replacement as Provincial Treasurer, [[Solon Low]], introduced the government's budget.  It included no implementation of social credit, and was attacked by the opposition parties as "the default budget"<ref name="Barr 102"/> and by insurgent Social Crediters as a "banker's budget" (a harsh insult given Social Credit's dim view of the banking industry).<ref name="Elliott 257"/>  Ronald Ansley rose immediately to attack it as containing "not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit."  Blue, again echoing Duggan, threatened on March 16 to vote against the government's interim [[supply bill]], the defeat of which, under the conventions of the [[Westminster parliamentary system]], would force the government's resignation.<ref name="Byrne 120"/>  In response, Aberhart praised Blue's courage in speaking his mind, and called him a worthy Social Crediter.<ref name="Elliott 258">Elliott 258</ref>

[[File:Solon Low.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|alt=Three men stand in a field.  The left-most is casually dressed and of aboriginal heritage, the middle one is a white man wearing ecclesiastical robes, and the right-most is a white man wearing a three piece suit.|The budget of [[Solon Low]] (right, pictured here with Chief Joe Bullshield and Archdeacon S. H. Middleton), which included "not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit", was the catalyst to the insurgents' decision to make their discontent public.]]Surprised by Aberhart's refusal to be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to reassess their strategy.  They got that time when, on March&nbsp;17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement.<ref>Elliott 258<U+2013>259</ref>  When the legislature reconvened March 22<ref name="Elliott 259">Elliott 259</ref> or 23,<ref name="MacPherson 170"/> the dissidents [[filibuster]]ed against the budget.  [[Albert Bourcier]] opened debate, and was followed by, among others, [[Edith Rogers (Alberta politician)|Edith Rogers]], Ansley, and [[Wilson Cain]].  On March&nbsp;24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25.  Though the insurgents considered this a [[vote of non-confidence]] in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.<ref name="Brennan 50">Brennan 50</ref>

==Coronation and recall petition==

Though the bulk of the revolt took place in and around the legislature over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also under attack on other fronts.  He had been invited to attend the [[Coronation of George VI of the United Kingdom|coronation of George VI]], set for May&nbsp;1937 in London, and planned to attend.  Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and under attack by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart.  In the same speech in which he threatened to bring down the government on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford.<ref name="Elliott 258"/>  Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.<ref name="Elliott 261">Elliott 261</ref>

Such a retreat was not an option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles.  One of Social Credit's 1935 promises had been the introduction of [[Recall election|recall]] for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act.<ref name="Elliott 273">Elliott 273</ref>  As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own [[Okotoks<U+2013>High River]] riding, where he had been elected in a [[by-election]] shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation.<ref name="Brennan 50"/>  On April&nbsp;9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association,<ref name="Barr 105">Barr 105</ref> and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate.<ref name="Elliott 273"/>  In response, the Social Crediters repealed the ''Recall Act'' retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition,<ref name="Elliott 273"/> and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.<ref>Barr 111</ref>

==Manoeuvring and negotiation==

On March&nbsp;29, in the aftermath of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of [[cloture|closure]] on the budget debate.  Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he might very well lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an interim supply motion instead.  The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated.<ref name="Elliott 259"/>  That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the ''Social Credit Measures Act'' to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of "experts" to implement social credit.<ref name="Elliott 260">Elliott 260</ref>

On March&nbsp;31 the insurgents kept their part of the agreement by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be [[hoist (motion)|hoisted]] for ninety days.<ref name="Barr 103">Barr 103</ref>  However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed that it was not as agreed and refused to support it.  Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24&nbsp;hours.  A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March&nbsp;31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading.  They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election.<ref name="Elliott 260"/>  The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election.  Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.<ref name="Elliott 261">Elliott 261</ref>

On April 8<ref name="Elliott 261"/><ref name="Barr 103"/><ref name="MacPherson 171">MacPherson 171</ref> or 12,<ref>Byrne 121</ref> the government capitulated.  Low's ''Alberta Social Credit Act'' delivered what the insurgents wanted, including the creation of "Alberta credit" in the amount of "the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services", the establishment of "credit houses" to distribute this credit, and the creation of a Social Credit Board.<ref name="MacPherson 171"/>  The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and "if anyone gets in our way, he's going to get into trouble ... we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart."<ref name="Barr 104">Barr 104</ref>

==Social Credit Board and commission==

The [[Social Credit Board]] comprised five backbenchers.  Insurgent [[Glenville MacLachlan]] was chair, and Aberhart loyalist [[Floyd Baker (Canadian politician)|Floyd Baker]] was secretary.  The other three members were insurgents [[Selmer Berg]], [[James L. McPherson]], and [[William E. Hayes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooke |first=Alfred |title=30+5: I know I was there |chapter=10 |year=1971 |publisher=Institute of Applied Art |location=[[Edmonton]] |url=http://douglassocialcredit.com/resources/resources/alf_hooke_chapter_10.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite canlaw |short title=Alberta Social Credit Act |abbr=S.A. |year=1937 |chapter=10 |link=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/page.aspx?id=2968239 |section=3 |subsection=1}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Published sources differ considerably on the identity of the final three members: Harold J.

[[File:C H Douglas.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A smiling man with a white moustache and a fedora|The Social Credit Board hoped that C. H. Douglas would come to Alberta to serve as its expert advisor. While Douglas declined to come himself, he did send two of his lieutenants.]]Historians have taken different approaches to analyzing the effect of the Board on traditional Westminster parliamentary governance.  [[C. B. MacPherson]] emphasized "the extent to which the cabinet had abdicated in favour of a board composed of a few private members of the legislature",<ref name="MacPherson 172"/>  Byrne agrees that "in some respects, the powers granted to the board superseded those of the Executive Council" but notes that "Aberhart was permitted to carry on with regular government operations."<ref name="Byrne 172">Byrne 172</ref>  Elliott and Miller take a similar approach to MacPherson's, suggesting that "Aberhart and his cabinet ... were in a position, strange in a cabinet system of government, of being ruled in the matter of economic policy by a board of private members that would be under the influence of Social Credit 'experts'."<ref name="Elliott 261"/>  Barr disagrees, arguing that the Board was "still under the control of cabinet" and pointing out that "the cabinet was left with the power", through its privileged position in introducing legislation, "to supplement or alter the provisions of the ''Alberta Social Credit Act''" under which terms the board was constituted.<ref name="Barr 103"/>

Whatever the relative influence of the Board and cabinet, the latter disavowed any ownership of the act that established the former.  Though it was a government bill, sponsored by Solon Low, the Provincial Treasurer explained that he took no responsibility for it, as it was drawn up by a committee of insurgents "without the interference of the cabinet".<ref name="MacPherson 172"/>  Though some insurgents complained that the version of the bill introduced by the government was different than that drafted by the committee, MacLachlan insisted that there had been no material changes.  The bill was passed April 13, and the legislature adjourned the following day.<ref name="MacPherson 173">MacPherson 173</ref>

Immediately after, MacLachlan invited Douglas to come to Alberta and take the head of the expert commission.  Douglas suggested that MacLachlan come to London to discuss the matter; MacLachlan left April&nbsp;29, arrived in London May&nbsp;9, and proceeded to meet with Douglas at his fishing lodge.<ref>Elliott 262<U+2013>263</ref>  Douglas refused to come to Alberta himself, but provided two of the "experts" the Board was charged with finding. The first was L. D. Byrne, who was in the insurance business, was an expert on social credit, and was appointed to do most of the substantive work.  The second, tire salesman George Frederick Powell, was expected to handle the commission's public relations.  Powell arrived in Edmonton June 10 with MacLachlan, while Byrne followed several weeks later.<ref name="Elliott 264">Elliott 264</ref>

While MacLachlan was in England finding his experts, feuding continued in Alberta.  Aberhart fired William Chant, a known Douglasite, from his cabinet after he refused to resign.<ref name="Elliott 263">Elliott 263</ref>  Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy.  Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000&nbsp;person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters of the insurgency.<ref name="Barr 105"/>  A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and proved to be a plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty.<ref name="Barr 104"/>  Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed a united front as they awaited the promised experts; in the first recorded vote after the legislature reconvened June&nbsp;7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.<ref>MacPherson 175</ref>

One of Powell's first actions on arriving in Edmonton was to prepare a "loyalty pledge" committing its signatories to "to uphold the Social Credit Board and its technicians."<ref name="Elliott 264"/>  Most Social Credit MLAs signed, and the six who did not wrote to Powell assuring him of their loyalty to Douglas's objectives<ref name="MacPherson 51">MacPherson 51</ref> (though one, former Provincial Treasurer Cockroft, later left the Social Credit League and unsuccessfully sought re-election as an "Independent Progressive").<ref name="Brennan 51">Brennan 51</ref>  The insurgency was over.

==Aftermath==

Byrne and Powell prepared three acts for the implementation of social credit: the ''Credit of Alberta Regulation Act'', the ''Bank Employees Civil Rights Act'', and the ''Judicature Act Amendment Act''.  The first required all bankers to obtain a license from the Social Credit Commission and created a directorate for the control of each bank, most members of which would be appointed by the Social Credit Board.  The second prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions.  The third prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's laws in court without receiving the approval of the [[Lieutenant-Governor in Council]].  All three acts were quickly passed.<ref name="MacPherson 177">MacPherson 177</ref>  New Lieutenant-Governor [[John C. Bowen]], asked to grant [[royal assent]], called Aberhart and Attorney-General Hugill to his office.  He asked Hugill if, as a lawyer, he believed that the proposed laws were constitutional; Hugill replied that he did not.  Aberhart said that he would take responsibility for the bills, which Bowen then signed.  As they left the meeting, Aberhart asked Hugill for his resignation, which he received.  Shortly after, the federal government [[Disallowance and reservation|disallowed]] all three acts.<ref name="Elliott 268">Elliott 268</ref>  Powell was not discouraged, stating that the acts "had been drawn up mainly to show the people of Alberta who were their ''real'' enemies, and in that respect they succeeded admirably."<ref>Elliott 269</ref>

In the fall, Aberhart re-introduced the three disallowed acts in altered form, along with two new acts.<ref name="Byrne 124">Byrne 124</ref>  The ''Bank Taxation Act'' increased provincial taxes on banks by 2,230%, while the ''[[Accurate News and Information Act]]'' gave the chairman of the Social Credit Board a number of powers over newspapers, including the right to compel them to publish "any statement ... which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government or Province" and to require them to supply the names of sources.  It also authorized cabinet to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, any article by a given writer, or any article making use of a given source.<ref name="Barr 109">Barr 109</ref>  Bowen [[disallowance and reservation|reserved]] approval of the bills until the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] could comment on them; all were ruled unconstitutional in ''[[Reference re Alberta Statutes]]''.<ref>Barr 112</ref>

During the fall session in which the offending bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000&nbsp;copies of a pamphlet called "The [[Bankers' Toadies incident|Bankers' Toadies]]", which urged its readers as follows: "My child, you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies.  God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous things.  NEVER, therefore, abuse them<U+2014>just exterminate them!"  The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General [[John Lymburn]], and [[Canadian Senate|Senator]] [[William Antrobus Griesbach]].  Powell and Social Credit [[whip (politics)|whip]] [[Joe Unwin]] were charged with [[criminal libel]] and counsel to murder.  Both were convicted of the former charge.  Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.<ref>Barr 109<U+2013>110</ref>

Aberhart's government was re-elected in the [[Alberta general election, 1940|1940 election]] with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats.
