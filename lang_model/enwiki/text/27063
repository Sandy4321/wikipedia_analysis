'''Club Cola''' is  the name of a [[cola]] [[soft drink]] once very popular in the [[GDR]]. 

Originally manufactured at the request of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] and other governmental organizations. Club Cola was created so that East Germany could have its own   cola soft drink that was similar in taste and appearance to those sold in the western world.
On  19 April [[1967]] the first Club Cola was bottled in Berlin. This soft drink was so popular with East German citizens that Club Cola was awarded with ''gold in the category soft drinks'' at the ''1972 [[Leipzig]] spring fair.

==Club Cola today==

A soft drink named ''Club Cola'' is still available in Germany today. It is not made according to the same recipe as the drink that used to be sold in the GDR, since the original formula was lost in 1990, when the former brand owners were going bankrupt. However, it is generally agreed that the taste is very similar to the original Club Cola.
