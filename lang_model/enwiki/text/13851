===Vietnam War and journalism===
In 1969, neither Gore nor his father were supporters of the [[Vietnam War]]. However, as a college graduate, he could no longer defer being [[Conscription in the United States|drafted into the U.S. military]]. In addition, his "low [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft number]] assured that he would be called up soon."<ref name=biosen>{{cite web

}}</ref> In debating how to proceed, his father, [[Albert Gore, Sr.]], later recalled that Gore "sat around with his mother and I in the living room and talked about it. He said he didn't believe in the Vietnam War. I said, 'Well, it isn't given in our law for an individual to go contrary to the law.' We discussed all the various things young men were doing to [[Draft dodger|dodge the draft]]."<ref name=biosen/> Also according to his Senate biography, Gore's "mother said that she would support whatever he wanted to do <U+2013> 'including [[Canada and the Vietnam War|going to Canada]] with him.' "<ref name=biosen/> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' later added in 1999 that very few of his Harvard classmates went to Vietnam. Instead, "most of his peers at Harvard were looking for a way out, and finding one. Some took refuge in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] or the [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|reserves]], options that might save them from Vietnam. A few resisted or became [[conscientious objector]]s or left for Canada."<ref name=serveornot/>

Gore has stated that he finally enlisted in the army for two reasons: he was concerned over the impact it would have upon his father's career and he did not want someone with less advantages than himself to go in his place. Al Gore Sr. was engaged in a difficult political campaign for the [[United States Senate elections, 1970|1970 Senate election]], one which would have been greatly impacted if his son did not enlist in the military. <ref name=son>{{cite web

}}</ref> This was due to the fact that Al Gore Sr., who had authorized American involvement in Vietnam in voting for the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in 1964, had by 1969 become a vocal opponent of the war.<ref name=mixed/> Thus the elder Gore appeared to some to be "too tolerant of social protest of all kinds and of change in general [...] Young Al worried that if he found a way around military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's opponents."<ref name=mixed/> 

Gore also chose to enlist because did not want someone to go in his place. Actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]] (a former housemate) later recalled Gore saying that "if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place."<ref name=harvardnyt/><ref name=tells>{{cite web

Gore refused the option of signing up for the National Guard, choosing instead to volunteer for the [[United States Army]], which meant [[Enlisted rank|enlisting]] for two years (he served from 1969 - to 1971).<ref name=mixed/><ref name=son/><ref name=CNNbio/> After enlisting in August 1969, Gore returned to the Harvard campus in his [[Uniforms of the United States Army|military uniform]] in order to say goodbye to his advisor and was "jeered" at by students. <ref name=pbschron/><ref name=harvardnyt/> He later described the visit as a "[[Ralph Ellison]] experience in that I was the same person inside but my physical appearance conveyed a message that completely overwhelmed the message of my humanity. It was just an emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing glances that shot arrows of what certainly felt like real hatred, and I was astonished."<ref name=harvardnyt/>

Gore had basic training at [[Fort Dix]] from August to October, and then was assigned to be a journalist at [[Fort Rucker]], Alabama. In April 1970, he was "Soldier of the Month."<ref name=mixed/><ref name=pbschron/> On May 19, 1970, Gore married Tipper at the [[Washington National Cathedral]].<ref name=pbschron/><ref name=wedding>{{cite web

His orders to be sent to Vietnam were "held up" for some time and he suspected that this was due to a fear by the [[Nixon administration]] that if something happened to him, his father would gain sympathy votes. <ref name=son/> He was finally shipped to [[Vietnam]] on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the 1970 Senate election, one "of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam."<ref name=boy/><ref name=father>{{cite web

Gore campaigned for [[President of the United States]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], but eventually dropped out. The democratic candidate would be [[Michael Dukakis]]. Despite defeat, Gore (with a strong third place) was one of the front-runners that year.

While Gore initially denied an interest in running, he was the subject of speculation prior to his announcement: "National analysts make Senator Gore a long-shot for the Presidential nomination, but many believe he could provide a natural complement for any of the other candidates: a young, attractive, moderate Vice Presidential nominee from the South. He currently denies any interest, but he carefully does not reject the idea out of hand."<ref name=twoworlds/> At the time, he was 39 years old, making him the "youngest serious Presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy."<ref name=twoworlds/> 

After announcing that he would run, Gore ran his campaign as "a Southern centrist, [who] opposed federal funding for abortion. He favored a moment of silence for prayer in the schools and voted against banning the interstate sale of handguns."<ref name=firstrun>{{cite web

Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings, recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations, and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions [...] Clinton involved Gore in decision making to an unprecedented degree for a vice president.

The Florida recount was stopped a few weeks later by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In the ruling, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', the Florida recount was called unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7-2 vote ruled that the standards the [[Florida Supreme Court]] provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and further ruled 5-4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving [[George W. Bush]] a 534 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 [[electoral votes]] and the presidency.<ref name=lawcornell>{{cite web

In 2008, Gore gave a speech at the [[DAR Constitution Hall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in which he called for a move towards replacing a dependence upon "carbon-based fuels" with [[Green energy]] by the [[United States]] within 10 years. Gore stated: "When [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] challenged our nation to [[John_F._Kennedy#Space_program|land a man on the moon and bring him back safely]] in 10 years, many people doubted we could accomplish that goal. But 8 years and 2 months later, [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] walked on the surface of the moon."<ref name=july17text>{{cite web

In a 1992 speech on the [[Gulf War]], Gore stated that he twice attempted to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to [[Saddam Hussein]], citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations.<ref name=92speech>{{cite web

Gore also frequently questioned policies associated with the Bush administration after the 2000 election. In a speech he gave  on September 23, 2002, before the [[Commonwealth Club of California]] he criticized President [[George W. Bush]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the rush to war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in [[Iraq]]. Gore compared this to the [[Gulf War]] (which he had voted for) stating, "Back in 1991, I was one of a handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion."<ref name=>{{cite web
