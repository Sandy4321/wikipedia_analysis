'''Bobrof Volcano''' is an [[inactive volcano|inactive]] [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]], USA, {{convert|1211|mi|km|0}} from [[Anchorage]]. It forms the small [[Bobrof Island]], {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} west of [[Adak]], part of the local sub-archipelago, the [[Andreanof Islands]], which extend for {{convert|275|mi|km|0}}. 

No recorded eruptions have taken place at Bobrof or in its vicinity. It has been considered as [[Holocene epoch|Holocene]] age.

== Geography and geology ==
Bobrof is part of the [[Andreanof Islands]], a smaller chain that is considered part of the Aleutian Islands.<ref name=GVP>{{cite gvp|vnum=1101-10-|name=Bobrof|accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> It is roughly {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} west of [[Adak]] and {{convert|9|mi|0}} west of [[Kanaga Island]].<ref name=GVP/> The volcanic crater, or cone, has been heavily dissected.<ref>{{cite web|url=|url=http://www.avo.alaska.edu/pdfs/B1028E.pdf|title=Reconnaissance geology of some western Aleutian Islands, Alaska: in Investigations of Alaskan volcanoes, U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin B 1028-E|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|author=[[Robert R.

The volcano is thought to be of Holocene age.<ref name=GVP/> Though no historical eruptions have taken place at Bobrof, it has erupted at least once.
