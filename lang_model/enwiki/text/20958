'''Robert Montgomery (Bob or Bobby''') '''Knight''' (born [[October 25]], [[1940]], in [[Massillon, Ohio|Massillon]], [[Ohio]], [[United States|USA]]), also known as '''The General''', is the head men's [[college basketball|basketball]] [[Coach (basketball)|coach]] at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]]. He was previously head coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]] and at [[United States Military Academy|Army]].

Knight has won more [[NCAA]] [[Division I]] men's basketball games than any other head coach. As of the 2007 NCAA tournament (3/27/07), that number stood at 890. 

Knight has won three NCAA championships (1976, 1981, 1987), one [[National Invitation Tournament]] championship (1979), and led the U.S. Olympic basketball team to a gold medal (1984). This is considered collegiate basketball's Triple Crown <ref>http://www.redraiders.com/coach/mbball/mbball_hcoach.shtml</ref>. Knight also led Indiana to 11 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships, and is a 4-time National Coach of the Year (1975, 1976, 1987, 1989).  

Knight is one of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I]] college basketball's most controversial coaches because of his [[behavior]]. He has thrown a chair across the court during a game, been [[arrest]]ed for physical [[assault]], and has repeatedly displayed a combative nature during his encounters with members of the press.  However, he is simultaneously commended for running clean programs (no Knight program has ever been sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations) and his high percentage of graduating players.

==Playing career==
Bob Knight began his career as a player at [[Orrville High School]] and continued under [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Fred R. Taylor|Fred Taylor]] at [[Ohio State University]] in [[1958 in sports|1958]]. He was a reserve on the [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Buckeyes']] [[1960 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1960]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I national championship]] team, which featured future Hall of Fame players [[John Havlicek]] and [[Jerry Lucas]]. Knight graduated with a degree in history and government in [[1962]].

==Coaching career==
===Army===
After graduation in [[1962 in sports|1962]], Bob Knight coached junior varsity basketball at [[Cuyahoga Falls High School]] in Ohio. After that, he accepted an assistant coaching position at [[United States Military Academy|Army]] in [[1963 in sports|1963]], where, two years later, he was named the head coach at the relatively young age of 24. In six seasons at West Point, Knight won 102 games, with his first as a head coach coming against [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]. One of his players was Hall of Fame coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]].

While at Army, Knight knew [[Bill Parcells]], the future coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[the New York Giants]], [[the New England Patriots]] and the [[New York Jets]]. Knight is regularly seen wearing Cowboys apparel at Texas Tech.

===Indiana===
Knight was noticed as a rising star, and when [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] was seeking a new coach in [[1971 in sports|1971]], they turned to Knight. Knight immediately endeared himself to the basketball-mad state of [[Indiana]] with his disciplined approach to the game {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Educated in military history, Knight was given the nickname "The General" by former [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] coach-turned-broadcaster [[Dick Vitale]].

Indiana reached the Final Four in 1973, losing to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. In [[1975 in sports|1975]], the Hoosiers were undefeated and the number one team in the nation, when leading scorer [[Scott May]] broke his arm in a win over arch-rival [[Purdue Boilermakers|Purdue]]. Indiana subsequently lost 92-90 to [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] in the regional finals of the [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]], May playing with a heavily-braced arm.

In [[1976 in sports|1976]], the Hoosiers were undefeated at 32-0 and won [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|the championship]], beating conference rivals [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]] 86-68. Immediately after the game, Knight lamented that "it should have been two."  No [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's team has had an undefeated season since.

Knight's Hoosiers also won championships in [[1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1981]], with future [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and Hall of Fame [[point guard]] [[Isiah Thomas]], beating North Carolina 63-50; and in [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1987]] with guard [[Steve Alford]], beating [[Syracuse Orange|Syracuse]] 74-73 on a last-second shot by [[Keith Smart]].

Indiana won the [[1979 National Invitation Tournament|1979]] [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] championship, and Knight led the [[U.S. national basketball team|U.S. national team]] to a gold medal in the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] as coach of the [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] team (coaches do not receive medals in the Olympics). He also won eleven [[Big Ten Conference]] titles. Knight is one of only four coaches to win NCAA, NIT, and Olympic championships, joining [[Dean Smith]] of [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], [[Adolph Rupp]] of Kentucky, and [[Pete Newell]] of [[California Golden Bears|California]]. Knight is the only coach to win the NCAA, the NIT, the Olympic Gold and the Pan-Am Gold.

The Indiana Hoosiers were undefeated in Big Ten Conference play from [[1974 in sports|1974]] to [[1976 in sports|1976]], and lost only one game during the period (the aforementioned regional final against Kentucky).

Knight failed to convince future NBA legend [[Larry Bird]] to stay at Indiana University.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Bird, who was raised in the small southern Indiana town of [[French Lick, Indiana|French Lick]], did not like the massive IU campus. He left Indiana University never having attended a single practice and returned home before later enrolling at the far smaller [[Indiana State University]], where he would lead the Sycamores to the national championship game in the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979 NCAA tournament]], losing to [[Earvin "Magic" Johnson|Magic Johnson]]'s [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] team.

In [[1991 in sports|1991]], Bob Knight was elected to the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in his second year of eligibility. After Knight wasn't elected in his first year of eligibility, Knight told the committee to take his name off the list, but they denied his request. Knight has consistently had among the highest graduation rates among college coaches.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===="Zero Tolerance"====
On [[March 14]], 2000, just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament, the CNN/SI network ran a piece on Knight in which former player [[Neil Reed]] claimed he was choked by Knight in a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story.

On April 11, CNN/SI aired a tape of an IU practice from 1997 that showed Knight with his hand around the neck of Neil Reed.[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/11/knight.protest.02/] 

In May of that year, Indiana University president [[Myles Brand]] announced that he had adopted a "zero tolerance" policy with regard to Bob Knight's behavior.

====Termination from Indiana====
[[Image:Knight on SI.jpg|thumb|200px|Knight's dismissal led to a media storm of publicity including the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.]]
In [[September 2000]], an IU [[freshman]] named Kent Harvey reportedly said, "Hey, Knight, what's up?" to Bob Knight. According to Harvey, Knight grabbed him by the arm and berated him for not showing him proper respect. According to Knight, Harvey was exaggerating the incident; he only grabbed his arm and lectured him about manners and respect. Assistant coach [[Mike Davis (basketball coach)|Mike Davis]] supported Knight's statement. The [[Indianapolis Star]] published photos of Harvey with marks on his arm. No charges were filed against Knight for the incident.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been placed on Knight.  He asked Knight to resign on [[September 10]]. When Knight refused, however, he then relieved Knight of his duties immediately.  That evening, a crowd of thousands of students swarmed Bloomington in protest.<ref>http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/11/knight.protest.02/]</ref>
 
Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he intentionally set up Knight. Knight's supporters contend he was the victim of a media smear campaign orchestrated by enemies in the IU administration and that the majority of Brand's reasons for firing Knight were not credible. However, Knight said he didn't think he was set up.

The following day, [[September 11]], Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they let Harvey get on with his education and his life.<ref>http://archive.org/details/bobknight_farewell</ref> Knight's firing made national headlines including the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and around the clock coverage on ESPN. It was also mentioned on major news programs such as CBS News and CNN.

Two years later, Knight sued [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], claiming the university violated his employment contract. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

===Texas Tech===
After taking the next season off, all the while on the lookout for vacancies, Knight accepted the head coaching job at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]]. At the press conference introducing him, Knight quipped, "This is the most comfortable red sweater I've had on in six years."

Knight quickly improved the program, which had not been to an NCAA tournament since 1996. He led the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Red Raiders]] to postseason appearances in each of his first four years at the school (three NCAA Championship tournaments and one [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]). After a rough 2006 season, the team improved in 2007, finishing 21-13 and again making it to the NCAA Championship tournament, where it lost to [[Boston College Eagles basketball|Boston College]] in the first round. The best performance by the Red Raiders under Knight came in 2005 when they advanced as far as the [[Sweet Sixteen]].  In both 2002 and 2007 under Knight, Texas Tech defeated two Top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks.  During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders have won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.

==Knight's basketball philosophy==
Bob Knight's [[motion offense]] emphasizes post players setting screens and perimeter players passing the ball until a teammate becomes open for an uncontested [[jump shot]] or [[lay-up]]. This requires players to be unselfish, disciplined, and effective in the setting and use of [[screen (basketball)|screens]] to get open. On defense, players are required both to tenaciously guard opponents man-to-man and to help teammates when needed. When the three-point line was instituted in 1986-87, Knight indicated "There are only three players in the Big Ten who can hit it, and I have two of them."

Knight's coaching influences include [[John Wooden]], [[Pete Newell]], [[Hank Iba]], and [[Adolph Rupp]].

==Most coaching victories==
On [[January 1]], [[2007]], at Texas Tech, Knight achieved his 880th career win, passing retired North Carolina coach [[Dean Smith]] for the most career NCAA Division I men's college basketball victories. The game was a 70-68 victory by the Red Raiders over the [[New Mexico Lobos basketball|New Mexico Lobos]]. Knight trails both Adolph Rupp and Dean Smith in win differential, which is the difference between wins and losses and reflects Knight's lower lifetime winning percentage, as it took Knight 41 seasons and 100 extra games to achieve the record, compared with Smith's 36.  However, Knight overtook Smith at a younger age.  (He was also one of the youngest or the youngest to reach milestones 200 (age 35), 300 (age 40), 400 (age 44), 500 (age 48) and 600 (age 52).)

During the recognition ceremony following the game, Knight's eyes filled with tears.  Knight has repeatedly asserted that the milestone is more a reflection of the talent of the many players he has coached than his own coaching ability or longevity.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The Red Raiders' participation in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] marked another record. With their inclusion as the #10 seed in the East Regional, Knight became the coach to lead his team to more NCAA Tournaments than any other. However, the team lost to [[Boston College Eagles basketball|Boston College]] in the first round by a score of 84-75.

Knight was the 2007 recipient of the [[Naismith Outstanding Contribution to Basketball|Naismith Award for Men's Outstanding Contribution to Basketball]].<ref name="Naismith">{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/03/30/Sports/Knight.To.Receive.Naismith.Award-2813903.shtml?reffeature=htmlemailedition | title=Knight to receive Naismith award | publisher=[[The Daily Toreador]] | date=2007-03-30 | accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, Knight was the first person to be honored with the [[Naismith College Coach of the Year|Naismith Men's College Coach of the Year Award]].

*In [[1979 in sports|1979]], Knight was arrested for assaulting a police officer during the [[Pan American Games]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. Knight was angry that a practice [[gym]]nasium was not opened to his team, which went on to a 9-0 record in the tournament. Knight was later convicted ''[[in absentia]]'' in a Puerto Rican court. However, the charges were later dropped when Indiana Governor [[Otis R.

* Knight was shown berating a NCAA university volunteer at a [[1998 in sports|1998]] news conference. The volunteer informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when he was actually only running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: "You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID (Sports Information Director), and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know. Do you have any idea who it was?...Who?...They were from Indiana, right?...No, they weren't from Indiana, and you didn't get it from anybody from Indiana, did you? ... No, I -- I'll handle this the way I want to handle it now that I'm here...You messed it up to begin with! Now just sit there or leave, I don't care what you do!"  Turning back to the press, he added, "Now back to the game."<ref> http://sports.espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show3transcript.html </ref>

*In February 2004, Knight again made national headlines for a "verbal dustup" with then Texas Tech University Chancellor David Smith at a Lubbock supermarket. <ref>{{cite news| author=Patrick Gonzalez | url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/020304/loc_020304036.shtml | title=Knight, Smith in public spat | publisher=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=February 3, 2004}}</ref>

*In March 2006, a student's heckling at [[Baylor University]] resulted in Knight having to be restrained by a police officer. The incident was not severe enough to warrant any action from the [[Big 12 Conference]].<ref>{{cite news| author=Keith Whitmire | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/texastech/stories/030306dnspoknight.1c4691b0.html | title=Big 12 won't take action against Knight | publisher=The Dallas Morning News | date=March 2, 2006}}</ref>

*On [[November 13]], 2006, Knight was shown allegedly hitting player Michael Prince under the chin to get him to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and as of yet hasn't done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech athletic director [[Gerald Myers]] insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." Prince commented, "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up. He was telling me to go out there and don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself."<ref name="controversy">{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/chad/4350211.html | title=Viewing the Knight file, through fact and fiction | author=Chad, Norman | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=2006-11-20 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>

==Books about Bob Knight==
Books about Knight include [[A Season on the Brink|''"A Season on the Brink"'']] (ISBN 0-02-537230-0) by [[John Feinstein]], "Bob Knight: His Own Man" by Joan Mellen (ISBN 0-380-70809-4), and ''"Playing for Knight: My Six Seasons with Bobby Knight"'' (ISBN 0-671-72441-X) by former player and current [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] head basketball coach [[Steve Alford]].

"A season on the Brink" Author John Feinstein (recommended to Knight by Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski){{Fact|date=February 2007}} was granted full access to the program and Knight's personal life for an entire season.  The book was later made into a television movie by [[ESPN]], with [[Brian Dennehy]] portraying Knight.

In [[2002]], Knight and longtime friend and sports journalist Bob Hammel wrote his [[biography]], ''"Knight: My Story"'' (ISBN 0-312-31117-6.)

In ''[[Bob Knight, His Own Man]]'', Mellen characterized Feinstein's book as being banal (21).

In [[2006]], an "unauthorized" biography on Knight, written by Steve Delsohn and Mark Heisler, was released. (ISBN 0-7432-4348-X)

==Film and television==
Many aspects of the teaching style and basketball philosophy of Coach Norman Dale (played by [[Gene Hackman]]) in the [[1986 in film|1986]] movie ''[[Hoosiers]]'' are derived from Bob Knight's real history. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

''[[Blue Chips]]'' is a [[1994 in film|1994]] feature film about Pete Bell, a volatile, but honest college basketball coach under pressure to win who decides to blatantly violate NCAA rules to field a competitive team after several sub-par seasons. It starred [[Nick Nolte]] as Bell and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as Neon Bordeaux, a dominating once-in-a-lifetime player Bell woos to his school with gifts and other perks. Several incidents in the film are clearly inspired by Knight's history. Current NBA guard [[Penny Hardaway|Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway]] co-stars as another "blue chipper" recruited by Bell. NBA legend [[Bob Cousy]] plays the school's president. Knight himself has a cameo alongside other collegiate and NBA legends such as [[Larry Bird]] and [[Rick Pitino]].  ESPN writer Bill Simmons once wrote about the film, and stated that while the Bell character cheated, Knight would never have done so.

In [[2002 in film|2002]], veteran character actor [[Brian Dennehy]] portrayed Knight in ''[[A Season on the Brink]]'', a TV film adapted from John Feinstein's book. It was ESPN's first feature-length film.

Knight made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2003 film ''[[Anger Management]]''.
