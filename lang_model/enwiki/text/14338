== Personal life ==
Like the hero of ''Ready Player One'', Ernest Cline spent much of his young adulthood working a series of low-paying tech support jobs that allowed him to surf the Internet while on the clock and research his many pop-culture obsessions.<ref name="qanda">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/030788743X Q&A with Ernest Cline, Amazon.com]</ref>

Cline, a huge fan of the [[Back to the Future]] film series, owns a 1982 [[DeLorean DMC-12]] sports car that has been modified to look like the time-travelling vehicle from the films. <ref name="guest">[http://www.amazon.com/dp/030788743X Amazon.com review of Ready Player One, guest reviewer: Daniel H.
