In addition to being listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a district, several individual properties are or have been listed. Located near the center of Woodward Heights, the Botherum, a private residence built in 1850, was listed in 1973. At the northeast side of the neighborhood, adjoining Woodward Heights Park, the Henry Watt House (also known as the Saunier House and the Watt-Saunier House) was listed in 1977. Built circa 1818, it was the second-oldest house in the area, and no longer stands.<!-- I think it had a fire in the mid- or late-1990s and was irreparably damaged, demolished soon after, but I can't find any sources. -->
