The '''High Plateau line''' is network of railway lines under construction across [[Algeria]]. The project is managed by [[Anesrif]].

==Route==
{{High Plateau line}}
The route runs 1200&nbsp;km from [[Tebessa]] in the east to [[Moulay Slissen]] in the west, via [[Tiaret]] and [[M'Sila]], through a sparsely populated area bordering the [[Atlas mountains]] and the [[Sahara]]; 18 new passenger stations are planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/planning-a-railway-to-the-high-plateau.html|
accessdate=2011-03-24|title=Planning a railway to the High Plateau|publisher=Railway Gazette}}</ref> This route incorporates some elements of the existing network, connected by 630&nbsp;km of new lines.<ref name="Euromed">{{cite web|url=http://www.euromedtransport.org/fileadmin/download/InfrastructureTechnicalNotes/IP0335-RPT-TR-15_Technical_Note_10.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-23|publisher=European Commission|title=TECHNICAL NOTE 10 <U+2013> LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE FOR MEDA REGIONAL RAIL SERVICES}}</ref>

Most of Algeria's existing rail network is further north, along the coast; the "inland" route allows traffic to bypass the main "[[Rocade Nord]]" route through [[Constantine]], [[Algiers]], and [[Oran]]. This project goes hand in hand with [[Anesrif]]'s other plans to improve Algeria's 4000&nbsp;km of existing railways.<ref name=MEED>{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Hugh|title=Algiers to tender $1.5bn worth of work on railway expansion|accessdate=24 March 2011|newspaper=MEED|date=12/12/2008}}</ref> 

A further stretch of railway will run from [[Tlemcen]] to a new station at [[Maghina]] and then to the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] border at [[Akid Abbas]].<ref name=RJ1>{{cite web|url=http://www.railjournal.com/newsflash/international-consortium-to-build-algeria-morocco-link.html|accessdate=2011-03-24|title=International consortium to build Algeria - Morocco link|publisher=International Railway Journal}}</ref> The border with Morocco has been sealed since 1994, but there is pressure to reopen the border to travellers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16219845|accessdate=2011-03-23|title=Algeria and Morocco: Open that border|publisher=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrik-news.com/article15340.html|accessdate=2011-03-23|title=Morocco - Algeria border: The tug of war continues|publisher=Afrik News}}</ref>

==Specification==
The route is mostly being built for 160&nbsp;km/h running, although the line near the Moroccan border is designed for higher speeds. The line is [[standard gauge]], even though it crosses some existing 1055&nbsp;mm (approximately 3 feet, 6 inches) gauge lines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/desert-riches-fuel-network-revival.html|accessdate=2011-03-27|title=Railway Gazette: Desert riches fuel network revival}}</ref> and mostly single-track.<ref name=MEED/>

There is provision for 25&nbsp;kV [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] in the future. [[GSM-R]] will be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.com/ext/nt/algerian-railways-selects-nortel-for-gsm-r-communications-systemexpansion|accessdate=2011-03-24|title=Algerian Railways Selects Nortel for GSM-R Communications System Expansion}}</ref>

==Project==
The project is being managed by [[Anesrif]], an Algerian state agency which is undertaking several large projects to revitalise railways and build new infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201006180923.html|accessdate=2011-03-23|title=allAfrica.com: Algeria: Beijing in the Line of Fire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meed.com/sectors/transport/anesrif-awards-rail-contracts/269268.article|accessdate=2011-03-23|title=Anesrif awards rail contracts | News | MEED}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africaintelligence.com/MCE/business-circles/2011/03/17/anesrif-shakes-out-of-deep-sleep%2C88727690-ART-login|accessdate=2011-03-23|title=ALGERIA - ANESRIF shakes out of deep sleep - Maghreb Confidential}}</ref> Anesrif has awarded contracts to various consortia.

Once in operation, new lines will be operated by [[SNTF]].

*In May 2010, a contract was awarded to build a 185km section of railway from Tissemsilt-Tiaret-Relizane, for 160km/h running; it will be designed with future electrification in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionbiz360.com/article/10/201006102010061713565433925d9fe8b/Algeria-wakes-up-to-infrastructure-demands.html|accessdate=2011-03-24|title=Algeria wakes up to infrastructure demands|publisher=ConstructionBiz360}}</ref>

*Work was expected to begin on the 153km Saida-Tiaret line in the summer of 2011.<ref name=RA/>

==Development==
The east-west High Plateau line incorporates some elements of existing Algerian lines, although away from the coast, existing infrastructure has mostly been north-south.<ref name="Euromed"/>
*The Tebessa-Annaba line largely operates independently, hauling [[iron ore]] and phosphates to a port on the coast; there have been proposals to spin it off as a private concession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/desert-riches-fuel-network-revival.html|

*There was already a line from Ain M'lilla to Barika, part of an oil export chain from [[Touggourt]], developed by [[France]] during the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=35025&session_lightbox_del=1&record_id=35025&media_urn=49218|accessdate=2011-03-27|title=FRANCE'S FIRST DESERT OIL - British Pathe}}</ref>
As existing railways in Algeria are poorly utilised, despite expensive investments in the past, there have been concerns about the authorities' ability to manage capacity appropriately.<ref name=worldbank>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTALGERIA/Resources/ALGERIAPER_ENG_Volume_I.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-26|title=PEOPLE<U+2019>S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA : A PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REVIEW|publisher=[[World Bank]]}}</ref> Away from the coast, Algeria is sparsely populated, although cities are expected to grow as a result of improved infrastructure; this has already happened in [[Tiaret]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/ahdrps/paper01-en.pdf|title=Population Levels, Trends and Policies in the Arab Region: Challenges and Opportunities|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref>
