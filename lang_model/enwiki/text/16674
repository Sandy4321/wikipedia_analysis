==Early life and career==
Wilson was born in [[Valdosta, Georgia]] and grew up in [[New York City]]. At the age of 6, Wilson's [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] ruptured, almost killing him. At that time the young Wilson vowed to somehow serve God as an adult in some ministry capacity. Wilson served in the US Army from 1966<U+2013>1968 and was in the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in Vietnam where he was wounded.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=LouieI |title1=Sanford and Son |title2=Fox and Wilson wake up TV's jaded audience |journal=Ebony |year=1972 |month=July |pages=56<U+2013>57}}</ref> Upon returning a decorated veteran in the late 1960s, Wilson was featured in several Broadway and [[Off Broadway]] stage productions before moving to Hollywood where he performed guest roles on several television series such as ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]'' and acted in films such as ''The Dealing'' (1970) and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' (1971).

===''Sanford and Son'' (1972<U+2013>1977) and other acting projects===
Later that year, after appearing as a robber on ''All in the Family'' with the late [[Cleavon Little]], Wilson won the role of Lamont Sanford in the NBC sitcom ''Sanford and Son''. Wilson played Lamont through the run of the series, and in fact became the de facto star when [[Redd Foxx]] walked off the show in 1974 over a salary dispute with the producers and his character was written out for the rest of the season. Foxx returned the following year and the pair worked together until 1977 when the show was canceled despite being still very popular. In 1980<U+2013>1981, Foxx attempted to revive the show with the short-lived ''Sanford'' but Wilson declined to reprise the role of Lamont for the new series.

Wilson also appeared in the films ''[[Full Moon High]]'' (1981), ''[[Me and the Kid]]'' (1993), and ''Hammer-Lock'' (2000).

===''Baby, I'm Back'' (1978), and ''The New Odd Couple'' (1982)===
Wilson later starred as divorc<U+00E9> Raymond Ellis in the short-lived CBS-TV comedy series ''[[Baby, I'm Back]]'' and as [[Oscar Madison]], opposite actor [[Ron Glass]] (who co-starred as [[Felix Unger]]) in the ABC TV sitcom ''[[The New Odd Couple]]'', a revamped black version of the original 1970<U+2013>75 series on the same network which starred [[Jack Klugman]] and [[Tony Randall]]

==Ministerial work==
In 1984, Wilson became an [[ordained]] [[Religious minister|minister]], fulfilling his childhood vow. Later, in 1995, he founded Restoration House, a center that helps rehabilitate former prison inmates by providing mentoring, [[spirituality|spiritual]] guidance and [[vocation]]al training.

===Literary works===
====Author of Christian books====
Wilson has written several Christian books concerning the [[New Age Movement]] and its hidden dangers to society.  ''New Age Millennium'' was released by CAP Publishing & Literary Co. LLC on December 1, 1998. (Demond's first name is misspelled "Desmond" on some book selling websites.) Wilson, who has also authored numerous children's books, stated the book to be an "expos<U+00E9>" of certain New Age "symbols and slogans".

====''Second Banana'': book about ''Sanford & Son'' TV show====
Wilson has also authored the book ''Second Banana: The Bittersweet Memoirs of the Sanford & Son Years'', which was released on August 31, 2009. According to an interview on the CelebrityCafe.com website, Wilson said: "It's just a documented truth, behind the scenes factual account of what happened during those years. Redd (Foxx) and I were making history back in those days. We were the first blacks to be on television in that capacity and we opened the door for all those other shows that came after us."<ref>[http://www.2ndbanana.net Demond Wilson / 2nd Banana: Bittersweet Memories of Sanford & Son Years official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/demond_wilson_2009.html Demond Wilson interview at Celebrity Cafe]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Measure of a Man homepage|url=http://www.themeasurestageplay.com/|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref>

===''Faith Ties'' film project===
Wilson has been working since 2008 to produce and act in a melodramatic family film based on the play ''Faith Ties''. Says Wilson of the project: "I play a broken down old drunk whose wife and daughter are killed and he's given up on life. His only friend is a talking scorpion named [[Adonis]]. The protagonist is a pastor who is in the middle while he watches the lives of people crumbling around him. It's a wonderful story."<ref>{{cite web|title=Faith Ties|url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/faith-ties/|work=Christian Film Database||accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref>
