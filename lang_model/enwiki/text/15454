"'''Comeback'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 35th overall. The episode was written by series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], directed by Bradley Buecker, and premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox]] on February 15, 2011. In the episode, [[glee club]] director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) allows cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) join the McKinley High glee club in an attempt to heal her depression. Club member [[Sam Evans|Sam]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]) creates a tribute band to teen singer [[Justin Bieber]] in order to win the heart of [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]), later joined by the group's other male members, minus co-captain [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), to recreate Bieber's "[[Somebody to Love (Justin Bieber song)|Somebody to Love]]" and woo their significant others. 

Prior to broadcast, series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] dismissed rumors that "Comeback" would serve as a tribute to Bieber, stating that such episodes are reserved for artists with extensive musical catalogs. "Comeback" was met with mixed reception from critics, who deemed it neither bad nor a standout. Critics such as Bobby Hankinson of ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' appreciated the episode's early ''Glee'' aesthetic. Amy Reiter of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' felt that the episode lacked substance. Sue's storyline, which focuses on her depression and a suicide attempt, was widely criticized for its inappropriateness. The other storylines had mixed to positive reviews, with many critics deeming "The Justin Bieber Experience" subplot the strongest, and James Poniewozik of ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' comparing it favorably to the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] tribute episode "[[The Power of Madonna]]." 

The episode features six musical performances, five of which were released as singles. Upon its initial airing, "Comeback" was watched by over 10.46&nbsp;million US viewers, and acquired a 4.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Unlike the story itself, most critics received the musical numbers with acclaim. The ''Glee'' take on Bieber's songs was praised, as were the vocals of cast members [[Amber Riley]] and [[Lea Michele]] in their duet of "[[Take Me or Leave Me]]" from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', and the confidence and performance of [[Ashley Fink]] in "[[I Know What Boys Like]]."

==Plot==
After her cheerleading squad lose a competition for the first time in seven years, coach Sue Sylvester becomes depressed, staging her suicide by overdosing on gummy vitamins. Her colleague [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) suggests that she join the school glee club, New Directions, to lift her spirits. Hoping to create discord within the group, Sue pits members [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] (Riley) and [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel]] (Michele) against one other. Her plan backfires when a duet between the two results in them deepening their respect for one another vocally. In an attempt to bring out the good in Sue, club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) takes her to a pediatric cancer ward, where they sing "[[This Little Light of Mine]]" with the patients.

Club member Sam Evans establishes a one-man tribute band to teen singer [[Justin Bieber]], entitled "The Justin Bieber Experience," hoping to win over his girlfriend Quinn, who he suspects still has feelings for her ex-boyfriend Finn. He performs Bieber's "[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]", dedicated to Quinn, and also entices the other girls in the club. Several of the male members<U+2014>[[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]), [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale]]) and [[Mike Chang|Mike]] ([[Harry Shum, Jr.]])<U+2014>are impressed by the effect he has on the girls, and convince him to let them join his tribute band. The foursome then performs "[[Somebody to Love (Justin Bieber song)|Somebody to Love]]", recreating the music video for the song in the auditorium, to the girls' delight. Quinn chooses Sam over Finn, but when [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) convinces Sam that Quinn cheated on him, he breaks up with her and begins dating Santana.

Meanwhile, [[Lauren Zizes]] (Fink) enlists Puck to help her with her first glee club solo. With Puck's assistance, she performs "I Know What Boys Like" by [[The Waitresses]], imagining the club members in their underwear for confidence. Sue suggests that the group performs "[[Sing (My Chemical Romance song)|Sing]]" by [[My Chemical Romance]] at the forthcoming Regionals competition, the theme of which is anthems. They rehearse the song, and it is well received by most of the members, who disregard Rachel's suggestion that they should compose an original song. Just as things appear to be well, Sue reveals that she has become the vocal coach for New Directions' Regionals competition, Aural Intensity.

The Sue storyline attracted multiple unfavorable reviews. Reiter criticized her inconsistent characterization, commenting that disparate scenes of Sue "rampaging through the halls on an abusive tear" and "smiling and singing with (apparently real) sick kids in the hospital" may be acceptable if they "grew organically from or revealed something new about Sue's character", but concluded that in "Comeback", "the elements seemed like fragments pasted together to form a disjointed collage."<ref name="AR"/> While VanDerWerff deemed it "not a bad arc, all things considered", he wrote that Sue's jokes about committing "Sue-icide" were "neither dark enough to provoke a startled burst or laughter nor funny enough to overcome their central tastelessness", and called the scene in the pediatric oncology ward "woefully misjudged and inappropriately hilarious."<ref name="TVDW"/> Gonzalez had a mixed reaction to the scene, lambasting the emotional manipulation but noting that it almost moved her to tears nonetheless.<ref name="SG"/> Hyman found it too sappy,<ref name="VH"/> and ''The Atlantic''{{'s}} Patrick Burns deemed it a "saccharine cliche" which he was unable to take seriously.<ref name="KF"/> Burns' ''Atlantic'' co-writer Meghan Brown found the use of seriously ill children "borderline offensive", and called Sue's suicide attempt "in totally bad taste".<ref name="KF"/> Miriam Krule of [[NPR]] felt that ''Glee'' went too far with the suicide attempt, opining that it treated a serious issue too lightly. Krule commented, "It's one thing to create a tone that's consistently mocking, even in a way that can be deemed offensive.

Other storylines received a more mixed response. Mullins appreciated Sam's break up with Quinn and the resolve he demonstrated in not taking her back, but both she and Gonzalez criticized his burgeoning relationship with Santana.<ref name="Mullins"/> Canning disliked the focus placed on Sam, commenting that there is little to his character beyond "loveable dope". He found that the love-triangle plot made little sense, and as such was hard to invest in.<ref name="RC"/> Poniewozik called Sam's Bieber subplot the episode's strongest element, deeming it fun if inessential. He praised ''Glee'' for encapsulating the "disposable fun" of Bieber's music, "without either sneering at it or making it more than it is", finding it better in this respect than "The Power of Madonna".<ref name="JP"/> Lauren received several positive reviews. While VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck "a lot less assured" than in "Silly Love Songs",<ref name="TVDW"/> Gonzalez deemed their scenes "as endearing as they are unrealistic",<ref name="SG"/> and Mullins wrote that "the ice around [her] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo."<ref name="Mullins"/> Respers France commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: "for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is able to take the concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness."<ref name="LRF"/> Reiter felt that in "Comeback", while new characters like Sam and Lauren "managed to shine", established favorites fared less well, stating: "Finn continues to be dismayingly drained of all that once made him so adorable, and Rachel, too, has been deprived of the depth and sex appeal she so carefully developed over time."<ref name="AR"/> Several critics raised similar criticism of Rachel<U+2014>Gonzalez found her need for Brittany's help "too much of a regression", disliking her returning to "old, desperate habits" after several episodes of personal growth.<ref name="SG"/> Canning felt that the storyline was forced,<ref name="RC"/> and Poniewozik observed that the episode "seemed to be trying less to advance her character then simply to give her something to do."<ref name="JP"/> VanDerWerff wrote that Rachel appeared to have five different subplots, none of which came together cohesively, reflecting the awkward construction of the episode.<ref name="TVDW"/>

===Music and performance commentary===
The episode's musical covers and performances were mostly well-received by critics. Bobby Hankinson of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' was favorable of all musical performances, writing, "the music tonight blended all of the show's best charms."<ref name="Hankinson"/> He said that all performances were his "Best Musical Numbers" of the week, calling Amber and Lea's "diva-off" as "fun", complimenting how Zizes "sold" her performance, as well as noting how the show "made two songs seem less cheesy by shaving off some of the teen idol sheen off of the {{sic|the}} Bieber tunes."<ref name="Hankinson"/> Overall, Erica Futterman of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' complimented all of the music in the episode, commenting that somehow it continued the show's plot development.<ref name="Futterman"/>

The Bieber numbers received mostly positive reception. Jenna Mullins of [[E!|E! Online]] complimented the Bieber numbers, particularly Overstreet's performance of "Baby."<ref name="Mullins"/> Futterman said that Overstreet's "Baby" performance was "a total pop star package that recalled the Biebs' swag and had us as impressed as the glee girls."<ref name="Futterman"/> On "Somebody to Love", Futterman wrote, "take smooths over the R&B swagger of Bieber's version with Usher, but the boys embrace the cheesy pop factor of the tune and do an admirable job recreating the song's video in the McKinley auditorium."<ref name="Futterman"/> Sandra Gonzalez of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the Bieber songs as the best numbers from the episode, giving "Baby" and "Somebody to Love" grades of "A" and "B+", respectively.<ref name="SG"/> On the previous song, Gonzalez noted in the spirit of Glee's underrated vocalists stepping to the forefront, Sam "didn't disappoint", complimenting his "<U+00FC>bercorny dance moves that made me ache for the boy-band era."<ref name="SG"/> Although she complimented the guys' vocals and their "almost perfect re-creation" of the video, Gonzalez noted her disappointment with "Somebody to Love" similar to the [[Britney Spears]] recreations in "[[Britney/Brittany]]", commenting the songs and visuals needed to be "interpreted, not rehashed."<ref name="SG"/> Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' also complimented the Bieber numbers, calling Sam "quite charming while channeling Bieber" and said "the acoustic opening to "Baby" was actually very sweet, just as it was when Biebs stripped down the tune to open his Grammy performance."<ref name="KF"/> On the second Bieber song, Fallon wrote "it was the boys' dancing that stood out for once, in the "Somebody to Love" pop-and-lock-and-throw-chalk-in-the-air number."<ref name="KF"/> Raymund Flandez of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' did not think that Bieber's songs went well, calling it "disappointing", and writing that Sam's tribute to Bieber was "displayed so awkwardly and so undynamically."<ref name="Flandez">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/02/15/glee-season-2-episode-13-comeback-tv-recap/|title=<U+2018>Glee<U+2019> Season 2, Episode 13 <U+2018>Comeback<U+2019>: TV Recap|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=February 16, 2011|first=Raymund|last=Flandez|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]}}</ref> Flandez wrote that with "Baby", Overstreet didn't bring Bieber's "[[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] swagger, the coordinated moves of a mini-baby [[Michael Jackson]], and the enigmatic charm of a YouTube showman."<ref name="Flandez"/> However, Flandez was more favorable of the rendition of "Somebody to Love", but said that Sam was overshadowed by Artie.<ref name="Flandez"/>

It's always fun watching Michele, a Broadway veteran, sing a song that she's clearly been rehearsing for years. Countering with her unique brand of runs and range, Riley sassed up the arrangement with enough melisma to make the ''Glee'' version of the oft-covered modern musical theatre staple its own aural utopia."

Mullins coined Mercedes and Rachel's performance as "killer."<ref name="Mullins"/> Meaghan Brown of ''The Atlantic'' furthermore praised the duet, writing "while no doubt riling every musical theater purist with a pulse, was a highlight."<ref name="KF"/> Brown also said, "it had that addictive Glee quality of actually feeling like high school, and watching Mercedes and Rachel have a blast blasting each other was a treat."<ref name="KF"/> Gonzalez gave Mercedes and Rachel's duet a "B", writing while there was "so much to swoon for", she was partial to ballads as they discouraged oversinging throughout the song.<ref name="SG"/> Flandez wrote, "the showdown may be strange without context."<ref name="Flandez"/> Futterman said that while Mercedes had more sass than Rachel in "Take Me or Leave Me", she noted that "they do an impressive job of hitting their notes together and in duet moments."<ref name="Futterman"/> Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' didn't see how the duet was relevant and said Lea Michele's voice did not sound suited for the song.<ref name="TVDW"/> Fallon called the girls' duet the "undeniable highlight" of the episode.<ref name="KF"/> 

Futterman wrote Morrison's rendition of "This Little Light of Mine" was "charming", while calling Lauren Zizes's performances "hysterical."<ref name="Futterman"/> On "This Little Light of Mine", Burns said "This is completely acceptable behavior for real life, but was far too much of a saccharine cliche for me to even consider taking seriously on television."<ref name="KF"/> VanDerWerff of noted Lauren's "I Know What Boys Like" as the episode's best musical number, complimenting her confidence, but said the underwear joking as "unnecessary and overstated."<ref name="TVDW"/> According to Flandez, Lauren Zizes performances of "I Know What Boys Like" was the highlight of the episode.<ref name="Flandez"/> Gonzalez was less than enthused with "I Know What Boys Like", giving it a "C-", and writing that it "the flag equivalent of a big fist giving the rest of the world a finger."<ref name="SG"/> Gonzalez said the only reason the number earned a "C" was due to the shots of showing the cast in their underwear.<ref name="SG"/> Patrick Burns of ''The Atlantic'' was unimpressed with Lauren's first solo, and questioned her spot in Glee club, commenting "her brazen character never ceases to please, but it's just not believable that she would join the glee club if she cannot sing."<ref name="KF"/> 

On New Directions' collaboration with Sue on "Sing", Futterman wrote "By turning down the rock and bringing in a choral element, the song actually came off as a great anthem for the bunch of misfits that is the New Directions. We kind of wish they had put on their choir robes instead and fully embraced the arrangement."<ref name="Futterman"/> Although Gonzalez gave the performance of "Sing" a "B", she said the performance was "lacking" and the song wasn't "regionals material" and they needed to be "blown away."<ref name="SG"/> VanDerWerff also complimented the performance of "Sing."<ref name="TVDW"/> Fallon said that the My Chemical Romance cover seemed as if it could only be "construed to be part of some infomercial deal with Urban Outfitters to showcase the store's spring flannel line." <ref name="KF"/>
