'''''Laundry Service''''' ({{lang-es|'''Servicio de Lavander<U+00ED>a'''}}) is the fifth [[studio album]] by [[Colombian people|Colombian]] singer-songwriter [[Shakira]], globally released on 13 November 2001 by [[Epic Records]]. It is her first album to be primarily recorded in English. After the release of her fourth studio album ''[[D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?]]'', which became a success in Latin America, Shakira was encouraged by [[American people|American]] singer [[Gloria Estefan]] to record songs in English as she believed the singer had the potential to [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] into the English-language pop market. Shakira was initially hesitant to undertake the project, but later decided to learn English well enough to be able to write songs in the language herself. The title of the album was chosen to reflect Shakira's views on love and music. It was also released as ''Servicio de Lavander<U+00ED>a'' in Hispanic regions in January 2002. Musically, ''Laundry Service'' is primarily a [[Pop rock music|pop rock]] record but it also experiments with a variety of other musical styles, including [[Andean music]], [[dance-pop]], [[Middle Eastern music]], [[rock and roll]] and [[Tango (music)|tango]]. The lyrical theme of the album is mostly based around love and romance. Every song on the album was written and produced by Shakira.

Six singles were released from the album. The [[lead single]] "[[Whenever, Wherever]]" became an international success and reached number one on [[record chart]]s of countries like Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Follow-up single "[[Underneath Your Clothes]]" repeated its success, topping the charts of Australia, Austria, and Belgium. Both singles charted inside the top ten in the United Kingdom and United States. The third single "[[Objection (Tango)]]" became a top ten hit in most countries around the world. Spanish-language singles "[[Te Dejo Madrid]]" and "[[Que Me Quedes T<U+00FA>]]" performed well in Hispanic regions, becoming hits in Spain and on the Latin record charts in the United States, respectively. "[[The One (Shakira song)|The One]]" was a moderate commercial success and became the last single to be released from ''Laundry Service''. Shakira embarked on the [[Tour of the Mongoose]] in 2002 and 2003 to promote the album. It was her first major worldwide tour and visited numerous countries and cities.

Upon its release, ''Laundry Service'' received favourable to mixed reviews from [[music critics]]. Many critics complimented Shakira's incorporation of different musical styles in the production and her originality, while some critics argued that the album sounded too generic. Shakira's vocal talent also attracted praise. ''Laundry Service'' topped the charts of countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland, while reaching the top five in other countries like Argentina, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Laundry Service'' peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] chart. The album received numerous [[record certification]]s in various countries, including quintuple-[[Platinum certification|platinum]] certifications in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland. It was also certified multi-platinum in the United Kingdom and the United States, proving to be a successful crossover for Shakira. Globally, ''Laundry Service'' was the seventh best-selling album in 2002.

In 1998, Shakira released her second [[Major record label|major label]] studio album ''[[D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?]]'' (''Where Are the Thieves?''), which became a success in Latin America and received [[record certification]]s in various countries like Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Spain.<ref name=elespectador>{{cite web|title=Shakira en 'Servicio de Lavander<U+00ED>a'|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2001/12/8/ESCENARIOS/escen3.html|work=[[El Diario de Hoy]]|publisher=Editorial Altamirano Madriz, S.A|accessdate=10 November 2013|language=Spanish|date=8 December 2001}}</ref> The [[rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]]-influenced [[latin pop]] album drew comparisons to the work of [[Canadian people|Canadian]]-[[American people|American]] singer songwriter [[Alanis Morissette]]<ref name=dondereviewallmusic>{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Alex|title=D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones? - Shakira|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/d%C3%B3nde-est%C3%A1n-los-ladrones-mw0000045951|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

The success of ''D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?'' prompted American singer [[Gloria Estefan]], whose husband [[Emilio Estefan]] was managing Shakira at that time, to persuade Shakira to attempt to [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] into the mainstream [[pop music|pop]] industry.<ref name=gloriainterviewlatina>{{cite web|last=Romero|first=Angie|title=Gloria Estefan Week: Will There Ever Be Another Shakira?

I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me."<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze /> After completing "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of [[Uruguay]].<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze /> She wrote various songs with a "dictionary in one hand and a thesaurus in the other."<ref name=developmenttelegraph /> Shakira collaborated with various writers and producers on the album including Estefan, [[Lester Mendez]], Luis Fernando Ochoa and [[Tim Mitchell]].<ref name=reviewallmusic>{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Alex|title=Laundry Service - Shakira|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/laundry-service-mw0000016418|publisher=AllMusic.

Shakira's record label at that time, [[Epic Records]], opposed the decision to release and commission ''Laundry Service'' as they "wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin record."<ref name=gloriainterviewlatina /> Estefan argued with [[Tommy Mottola]], then head of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (the parent company of Epic Records), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an "American audience" would not buy a Spanish record simply due to its inclusion of a few English tracks.<ref name=gloriaoprahbillboard>{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|title=Gloria Estefan 'Fought Hard' for Shakira: 'Oprah's Next Chapter' Clip|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/5267772/gloria-estefan-fought-hard-for-shakira-oprahs-next-chapter-clip|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=10 November 2013|date=31 July 2013}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]'', she said "I got in the trenches there with Tommy [Mottola] - I fought for that.

Although primarily a [[pop rock]] album, ''Laundry Service'' also draws influences from a variety of musical genres.<ref name=backgroundtitlebillboard /> The singer credited this to her mixed ethnicity, saying "I am a fusion. That's my persona. I'm a fusion between black and white, between pop and rock, between cultures - between my Lebanese father and my mother's Spanish blood, the Colombian folklore and Arab dance I love and American music."<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze /> Arabian and [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]] elements, which had a high influence on ''D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?'',<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze /> are also present in ''Laundry Service'', most prominently on "Eyes Like Yours" (Ojos As<U+00ED>).<ref name=reviewallmusic /> Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. [[Tango (music)|Tango]], a style of fast-paced [[ballroom dance]] that originated in [[Argentina]], is evident on "Objection (Tango)", which also combines elements of [[rock and roll]].<ref name=backgroundtitlebillboard /> The [[uptempo]] track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers [[rapping|rap]]-like vocals.<ref name=reviewguardian>{{cite web|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|title=Thong songs|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/mar/08/popandrock.shopping|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=10 November 2013|date=8 March 2002}}</ref> "[[Whenever, Wherever]]" blends pop rock with [[Andean music]] and contains [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] from [[panpipes]] and the ''[[charango]]'' - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre.<ref name=reviewallmusic /><ref name=reviewbarnesandnoble>{{cite web|last=Schwartz|first=Mark|title=Laundry Service - Editorial Review|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/laundry-service-shakira/6021180?ean=74646390023&isbn=74646390023&sc=y+y&z=y|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref>

A few songs are also influenced by [[Dance music|dance]]-based genres; the "feisty" "Rules" is laced with [[new wave music|new wave]] and "Ready for the Good Times" is inspired by [[disco]] music.<ref name=reviewbillboard>{{cite web|last=Paoletta|first=Michael|title=Laundry Service|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77802/laundry-service|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=10 April 2014|date=17 November 2001}}</ref> The [[power ballad]] "[[Underneath Your Clothes]]" has Shakira delivering "racked" vocals and features [[brass instrument]]ation influenced by English rock band [[The Beatles]].<ref name=reviewguardian /> It contains a melody similar to the one in "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]", a 1989 song by American all-female band [[The Bangles]]. Similarly, the tune of "[[The One (Shakira song)|The One]]", another power ballad on the album,<ref name=reviewpopmatters>{{cite web|last=Cibula|first=Matt|title=Shakira: Laundry Service|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/shakira-laundry/|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=12 November 2001}}</ref> is similar to that of "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]", a 1965 song by The Beatles.<ref name=reviewguardian /> "Fool" and "Poem to a Horse" are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette<ref name=reviewyahoo>{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Lisa|title=Shakira 'Laundry Service' Album Review|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/l_reviews_a/24260.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The lyrics of most songs in ''Laundry Service'' are based on issues and themes related to love, as they had been written after Shakira began a relationship [[Antonio de la R<U+00FA>a]], the son of former Argentine president [[Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a]].<ref name=backgroundtitlebillboard /> "Underneath Your Clothes" is an "ode" to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person.<ref name=reviewyahoo /> Shakira shows an "important side" in "The One", which is a song about how "you love your guy so much that you<U+2019>re actually going to learn to cook"<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> and contains lines like "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone."<ref name=reviewguardian /> In "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is "condemned" to her and lists "all the things your new boy can do."<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> Songs like "Objection (Tango)" and "Fool" also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train."<ref name=reviewyahoo /> In the song, Shakira asserts that "Next to her [[Breast implant|cheap silicon]] I look minimal/That<U+2019>s why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers {{sic}}."<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> "Fool" discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a "shitty {{sic}}, self-absorbed man" even after suffering a "soul-crushing defeat."<ref name=reviewyahoo />

Shakira chose to entitle the album "Laundry Service" as she wanted to represent her "two great passions: love and music", which she compared to soap and water, saying "The reason I named it "Laundry Service" is because I've spent the year dedicated to my two great passions: love and music.

To promote ''Laundry Service'', Shakira embarked on the [[Tour of the Mongoose]] from 2002 to 2003. The tour was the singer's first worldwide tour and visited 50 cities and 30 countries, with its kick-off concert show held in [[San Diego]], California.<ref name=tourreebokwwd>{{cite web|title=Reebok Backing Shakira Tour|url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/reebok-backing-shakira-tour-750097?full=true|work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|publisher=[[Fairchild Fashion Media]]|accessdate=19 November 2013|date=26 September 2002}}</ref> Various brands and franchises co-sponsored the tour, including international clothing brand [[Reebok]] and soft drink brand [[Pepsi]].<ref name=tourreebokwwd /><ref name=pepsidealbillboard>{{cite web|last=Jeckell|first=Barry A|title=News on Shakira, Travis, and the Corrs|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/79519/billboard-bits-shakira-travis-the-corrs|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> Seven buses and ten trailers were also employed to transport all the staff members.<ref name=tourdetailsterra /> A stage covering 350 square meters was set up and preparations to arrange 280,000 watts of [[Sound and light show|sound and light]] were made.<ref name=tourdetailsterra>{{cite web|title=Barcelona Se Rinde A Los Pies De Shakira|url=http://www.terra.es/ocio/articulo/html/oci17784.htm|publisher=Terra Networks.

<blockquote>"It's called the Tour of the Mongoose, and the mongoose is basically one of the few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite.

Likewise, the theme of the tour was highly influenced by Shakira's political views, and this was prominently seen during the performance of "[[Octavo D<U+00ED>a]]", a song from ''D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?'', during which a film showing puppet caricatures of [[George W.

Critical reception towards ''Laundry Service'' ranged from favourable to mixed, with critics expressing different opinions regarding the production and composition of the album. Alex Henderson from [[AllMusic]] commended Shakira's songwriting abilities in English, calling it a "challenge that she handles impressively well. Shakira, it turns out, sings quite convincingly in English," and also praised her different mixes of musical styles, saying "Like Shakira's Spanish-language albums, this self-produced CD is enjoyably eclectic; she successfully combines pop/rock with everything from tango on "Objection (Tango)" and Andean music on "Whenever, Wherever" to Middle Eastern music on "Eyes Like Yours".<ref name=reviewallmusic /> He concluded that "''D<U+00F3>nde Est<U+00E1>n los Ladrones?'' remains Shakira's most essential album, but ''Laundry Service'' is an excellent English-language debut for the South American vocalist."<ref name=reviewallmusic /> A critic from ''Billboard'' also favoured the presence of various musical styles on the album and commented that "''Laundry Service'' finds the 24-year-old artist unafraid of merging musical flavors," and complimented Shakira's vocal talent.<ref name=reviewbillboard /> Similarly, the [[Entertainment.ie]] review of the album deemed the lyrical content "surreal" and the production "no less bizarre [...] imposing breakneck tangos, twanging guitar solos and bizarre raps onto a familiar soft rock template."<ref name=reviewentertainment.ie /> They felt that ''Laundry Service'' could not be called a "great album", reasoning that the "The line between fascinatingly strange and offputtingly weird is a thin one, and ''Laundry Service'' crosses it far too often," but also stated that "Even so, Shakira's star quality can hardly be denied - and in today's increasingly conformist pop industry that deserves at least two cheers."<ref name=reviewentertainment.ie /> Alexis Petridis from ''[[The Guardian]]'' lauded Shakira's originality, opining that "In an age of personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious eccentricity makes her a true star," and commented that "Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric that it could be the work of 1970s rock surrealist [[Captain Beefheart]]" and "The music on ''Laundry Service'' gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap."<ref name=reviewguardian /> Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs "displays an attitude to plagiarism that [[Noel Gallagher]] would consider cavalier" and that "no one could claim ''Laundry Service'' was a groundbreaking work of art," he concluded that "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering."<ref name=reviewguardian /> Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] termed ''Laundry Service'' "the [[Cher]] album Cher never made" and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure [[rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]]" and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting.<ref name=reviewrobertchristgau /> Christgau also noted Shakira's strong [[vibrato]] and constant changing of [[Timbre (music)|timbre]] in her vocals.<ref name=reviewrobertchristgau /> Lisa Oliver from [[Yahoo! Music]] said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield "results ranging from corking to minging," but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it."<ref name=reviewyahoo />

David Browne from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', however, called the album a "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying "Its wan [[ska pop|ska-pop]], faux-[[country music|country]] ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or [[Shania Twain|Shania]])".<ref name=reviewew /> Matt Cibula from [[PopMatters]] gave a more mixed view in his review of ''Laundry Service''; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as "generic".<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> He felt that the album was "extremely safe" and speculated that the reason behind the album's "generic" sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying "when I read that she's [Gloria Estefan] helping you with lyrics and he's [Emilio Estefan] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background {{sic}}."<ref name=reviewpopmatters /> Ernesto Lechner from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' complimented the singer's voice as a "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," but commented that the involvement of a "battalion of producers and songwriters" led to Shakira sounding "downright silly" on ''Laundry Service'' and also criticised her "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore."<ref name=reviewrollingstone />

''Laundry Service'' garnered Shakira a number of awards.

The commercial success of the album led to Shakira being deemed one of the most successful Latin [[crossover artist]]s of all time,<ref name=legacybiochannel>{{cite web|title=Shakira - Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/shakira.html|publisher=[[The Biography Channel (UK and Ireland)|The Biography Channel]].

And I want [my success] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, you feel that the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago."<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze /> On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a "strong cultural statement" as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.<ref name=shakiinterviewfaze />
