'''''Fountain of Time''''', or simply '''''Time''''', is a [[sculpture]] by [[Lorado Taft]], measuring {{convert|126|ft|10|in|m}} in length, situated at the western edge of the [[Midway Plaisance]] within [[Washington Park, Chicago (park)|Washington Park]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, in the United States.<ref name=TFoTGTCT>{{cite news|title=Taft's 'Fountain of Time' Given To City Today|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=12|date=1922-09-15}}</ref> This location is in the [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]. Inspired by [[Henry Austin Dobson]]'s poem, "Paradox of Time", and with its 100 figures passing before [[Father Time]], the work was created as a monument to the first 100&nbsp;years of peace between the United States and Great Britain, resulting from the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814. Although the fountain's water began running in 1920, the sculpture was not dedicated to the city until 1922. The sculpture is a contributing structure to the Washington Park [[Historic_district_(United_States)#Federal-level|United States Registered Historic District]], which is a [[National Register of Historic Places]] listing.

Part of a larger beautification plan for the Midway Plaisance, ''Time'' was constructed from  a new type of molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete.<ref name=FFTBC/> Before the completion of [[Millennium Park]] in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the [[Chicago Park District]].<ref name=PAFOLOP/><ref name=UFSTIaAA/>  ''Time'' is one of several Chicago [[work of art|works of art]] funded by [[Benjamin Ferguson]]'s [[trust fund]].

<!--An October 1978 Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine feature by Jerome M. O'Connor, called attention to the disrepair of Taft's greatest works.  Resulting from the article, the Chicago Park District appropriated funds for stabiliaztion and initial work. The first phase of the work was observed with its re-dedication by Mayor Richard J. Daley, attended by the Chicago Fire Department Band.  

-->''Time'' has undergone several restorations, due to the deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s and the first few years of the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected many of the problems caused by these earlier restorations.  Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of ''Time'' continue to seek resources for additional lighting, and the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] has nominated it for further funding.

Logan formally presented Taft's plans to the fund's administrators at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=G142-4>Garvey, pp. 142&ndash;144.</ref> Taft's proposed Midway Plaisance beautification plan included two possible commemoration themes.  His first choice was to honor the memory of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] that had been held in Jackson Park in 1893.  His alternative was to commemorate the centennial of the 1814 Treaty of Ghent "marking a century of perfect understanding between England and America".  Since other plans to commemorate the Exposition were under way, the second theme choice was adopted as the justification for a second Taft commission from the Ferguson Fund.<ref name=G144-5>Garvey, pp. 144&ndash;145.</ref>  Contemporary newspaper accounts anticipated that Taft's entire Midway beautification plan would be approved easily.<ref name=G146-9>Garvey, pp. 146&ndash;149.</ref> 

[[File:Fountain of Creation.jpg|thumb|left|Taft with a model of ''Fountain of Creation'' (1910)]]
Taft's initial commission from the trust was limited to the creation of a full-sized plaster model of ''Fountain of Time'', under a five-year $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1913|r=0}}}}) annual installment contract signed on February 6, 1913. This would enable the model to be evaluated in 1918.<ref name=G144-5/>  Taft first created a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} quarter-scale model which received the Trustees' approval in May 1915.<ref name=G146/><ref name=G166>Garvey, p. 166.</ref> He eventually produced his full-scale plaster model, {{convert|100|ft|m}} in width peaking in the center, with an equestrian warrior and a robed model of Father Time with a height of {{convert|20|ft|m}}.<ref name=G146>Garvey, p. 146.</ref> The installation of this model near its intended location was delayed by Taft's [[World War&nbsp;I]] service with the [[Y.M.C.A.]] in France as part of a corps of entertainers and lecturers,<ref name=T62>Taft, p. 62.</ref> but was  completed in 1920.<ref name=G166/><ref name=T36>Taft, p. 36.</ref>  However, Taft's wider vision of a Chicago school of sculpture, analogous to other philosophical Chicago schools such as the contemporaneous [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school of architecture]] style,<ref name=G140>Garvey, p. 140.</ref> had lost momentum after the 1913 dedication of his ''Fountain of the Great Lakes''.<ref name=G149-50>Garvey, pp. 149&ndash;150.</ref> The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] style had become dated;<ref name=G173/><ref name=T38>Taft, p. 38.</ref>  instead of funding Taft's large-scale Midway Plaisance beautification plan, and providing the originally planned granite, bronze or Georgia marble materials, the trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture.<ref name=G166/>

Designed without [[expansion joints]], ''Time'' is one of a small number of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s.<ref name=MNTTOFT/> In 1936, ''Time'''s weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm than good, by using techniques such as [[sandblasting]] and patching cracks with rigid materials.<ref name=FFTBC/><ref name=MNTTOFT/>

By the 1980s the sculpture was crumbling; cracks had developed, details of the figures had worn away, and moisture had eroded the internal structure.<ref name=MNTTOFT/> In wintertime the fountain had to be protected by a [[Tarpaulin|tarp]].<ref name=Csstmo>{{cite web
