The '''1917 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final''' was the thirtieth All-Ireland Final and the deciding match of the [[1917 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]], an inter-county [[Gaelic football]] tournament for the top teams in [[Ireland]]. 

Dual star Turlough "Tull" Considine was through on goal for Clare but was tripped up, while both teams had goals disallowed, so only points decided the game, Wexford winning nine to five.<ref>''High Ball'' magazine, issue #6, 1998.</ref>

It was the third of four All-Ireland football titles won by Wexford in the 1910s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/kerry-on-honour-roll-1885579.html|title=Kerry on honour roll|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=14 September 2009|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>
