'''''Banksia speciosa''''', commonly known as the '''showy banksia''', is a species of large shrub or small tree in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteaceae]]. Reaching up to {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, it is a single-stemmed plant that has thin leaves with prominent triangular "teeth" along each margin, which are {{convert|20|<U+2013>|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|<U+2013>|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The prominent cream-yellow flower spikes known as [[inflorescence]]s appear throughout the year. As they age they develop up to 20 [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]] each that store the seed until opened by fire. It occurs on the south coast of [[Western Australia]] between [[Hopetoun, Western Australia|Hopetoun]] (33<U+00B0>57<U+2032>S) and the [[Great Australian Bight]] (approximately 33<U+00B0> S 130<U+00B0>E), growing on white or grey sand in [[shrubland]]. Though widely occurring, it is highly sensitive to [[Phytophthora cinnamomi|dieback]] and large populations of plants have succumbed to the disease.

Collected and described by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in the early 19th century, ''Banksia speciosa'' is classified in the [[Series (botany)|series]] ''[[Banksia ser. Banksia|Banksia]]'' within the genus. Its closest relative is ''[[Banksia baxteri|B. baxteri]]''. ''Banksia speciosa'' plants are killed by [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]], and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly [[honeyeater]]s, and a variety of insects. In cultivation, ''Banksia speciosa'' grows well on well-drained soil with a sunny aspect in areas with dry summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been [[Grafting|grafted]] onto ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' or ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]''.

A variant from the Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves.<ref name=atlas/> Otherwise, ''Banksia speciosa'' shows little variation across its range. Combined with its vigour and prominence in its habitat, this has led George to speculate that it is a recent development among its relatives.<ref name="George 1981"/>

''[[Banksia baxteri]]'' resembles ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' and co-occurs with it at the western edge of its range, but has shorter wider leaves with larger lobes, shorter flower spikes and is a smaller, more open shrub.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published a thorough revision of ''Banksia'' in his landmark publication ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. In [[Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Bentham's arrangement]], the number of recognised ''Banksia'' species was reduced from 60 to 46.

In 1891, German botanist [[Otto Kuntze]] challenged the generic name ''Banksia'' [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger|L.f.]], on the grounds that the name ''Banksia'' had previously been published in 1775 as ''Banksia'' [[Johann Reinhold Forster|J.R.Forst]] & [[Georg Forster|G.Forst]], referring to the genus now known as ''[[Pimelea]]''.

[[Alex George]] published a new [[George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|taxonomic arrangement]] of ''Banksia'' in his classic 1981 monograph [[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)|''The genus ''Banksia'' L.f. (Proteaceae)'']].<ref name="George 1981"/> Endlicher's ''Eubanksia'' became [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']], and was divided into three sections. ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' was placed in [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;sect. ''Banksia'']], and this was further divided into nine series, with ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' placed in [[Banksia ser. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Banksia'']].
He thought its closest relative was clearly ''Banksia baxteri'' based on their similar appearance, noting the two overlapped in their  distribution.<ref name="George 1981"/>

In 1996, [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus; their [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] [[Cladistics|cladistic]] analysis yielded a [[cladogram]] significantly different from George's arrangement. [[Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement]] retained ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' in series ''Banksia'', placing it in [[Banksia subser.

Instead, their next closest relative turned out to be the distinctive ''[[Banksia coccinea]]''.<ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | first1 = Austin R. | last1 = Mast | authorlink1 = Austin Mast | last2 = Givnish | first2= Thomas J. | year = 2002 | title = Historical Biogeography and the Origin of Stomatal Distributions in ''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra'' (Proteaceae) Based on their cpDNA Phylogeny | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 89 | issue = 8 | pages = 1311<U+2013>23 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/89/8/1311 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.89.8.1311 | issn = 0002-9122 | pmid=21665734}}</ref>

In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for ''Banksia''.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksia speciosa map.png|thumb|right|Distribution of ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' (Showy Banksia), shown on a map of Western Australia's biogeographic regions.<ref name="FloraBase"/>]]
''Banksia speciosa'' occurs on coastal dunes and sandplains in the [[Esperance Plains]] and [[Mallee (biogeographic region)|Mallee]] [[biogeography|biogeographic]] regions on the south coast of Western Australia,<ref name="FloraBase">{{FloraBase | name = ''Banksia speciosa'' R.Br   | id = 1850}}</ref> from East Mount Barren in the [[Fitzgerald River National Park]] and the vicinity of [[Hopetoun, Western Australia|Hopetoun]] eastwards to [[Israelite Bay]], generally within 50 km (31 mi) of the coast. The range extends inland to Mount Ragged and 25 km (16 mi) southwest of [[Grass Patch, Western Australia|Grass Patch]]. There is an outlying population to the east at [[Point Culver]] on the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name=atlas/>

''Banksia speciosa'' grows on flat or gently sloping ground on deep white or grey sand. It is often the dominant shrub in shrubland, commonly found with such species as ''[[Lambertia inermis]]'',<ref name="George 1981"/> ''[[Banksia pulchella]]'', and ''[[Banksia petiolaris|B. petiolaris]]''.<ref name=atlas/>

==Ecology==
The prominent flower spikes are visited by many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the [[New Holland Honeyeater]], as well as the [[Fuscous Honeyeater]], [[Western Wattlebird]] and [[Western Spinebill]]. Other birds recorded foraging include the [[Grey Butcherbird]] and species of [[thornbill]]. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles.<ref name=atlas/> The [[Short-billed Black Cockatoo]] breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.<ref name="witkowski91"/> 

''Banksia speciosa'' is [[serotiny|serotinous]], that is, it has an [[Canopy seed bank|aerial seed bank]] in its [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] in the form of the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened with fire and release seed in large numbers, which germinate and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Byron B. | last1=Lamont | authorlink1=Byron Lamont | first2=D.

Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and progressively store larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known.<ref name="witkowski91"/> An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'' seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring ''Banksia'' species. Though this suggested it might outcompete its [[conspecific]]s, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.<ref name="lamont 1995">{{cite journal|last=Lamont, Byron B.; Witkowski, E.T.F|year=1995|title=A Test for Lottery Recruitment among Four ''Banksia'' Species Based on Their Demography and Biological Attributes|journal=Oecologia|volume=101|issue=3|pages=299<U+2013>308|jstor=4220888}}</ref>

The tiny [[ascomycota|sac fungus]] ''[[Phyllachora banksiae]]'' subspecies ''westraliensis'' has been described from the leaves of ''B.&nbsp;speciosa'', its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1<U+2013>3&nbsp;mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25<U+2013>0.75 by 0.25<U+2013>1&nbsp;mm appear in the centre of the spots.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pearce | first1=Ceridwen A. | last2=Reddell | first2=Paul | last3=Hyde | first3=Kevin D.|year=2001|title=Revision of the Phyllochoraceae (Ascomycota) on Hosts in the Angiosperm Family Proteaceae|journal=Australian Systematic Botany|volume=14|issue=2|pages=283<U+2013>328|doi=10.1071/SB00006}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
A fast-growing and attractive plant, ''Banksia speciosa'' grows readily in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been [[Grafting|grafted]] successfully onto ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' and ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' to enable cultivation in these areas.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/><ref name=Collins>{{cite book | last1 = Collins | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Collins | first2 = Kathy | last3 = George | first3 = Alex S. | pages = 48, 98<U+2013>99 |title =  Banksias | publisher = Bloomings Books | location = Melbourne, Victoria | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-876473-68-1 }}</ref> Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to [[germinate]].<ref name="Sweedman 2006">{{cite book | last1=Sweedman | first1=Luke | last2=Merritt | first2=David | year = 2006 | title = Australian Seeds: A Guide to their Collection, Identification and Biology | publisher = CSIRO Publishing| location= Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-09298-6 | page = 203}}</ref> A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] in 1830.<ref name="curtis"/> ''Banksia speciosa'' is an important [[cut flower]] crop.<ref name=Collins/> It was one of several species considered for commercial cropping in [[Tenerife]], and trials showed that seedlings were moderately [[halotolerance|tolerant to salinity]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rodriguez-Perez, J.
