The '''''Wacht'' class''' was a pair [[aviso]]s built by the [[Imperial German Navy]] in the late-1880s; the class comprised two ships, {{SMS|Wacht||2}} and {{SMS|Jagd||2}}. They were laid down in 1886 and 1887 and completed by 1888 and 1889, respectively. The ships were based on the previous aviso, {{SMS|Greif}}, which had proved to be an unsuccessful design due to its lack of torpedo armament. As a result, the ''Wacht''-class ships were equipped with three [[torpedo tube]]s to improve their combat power; they were also the first German avisos to carry armor protection. 

Both ships served in the main German fleet for the entirety of their active duty careers. They were primarily employed in the peacetime routine of unit and fleet training maneuvers. In September 1901, ''Wacht'' was accidentally rammed by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{SMS|Sachsen|1877|6}} during the annual fleet maneuvers. The collision caused serious damage to ''Wacht'' and she quickly sank. ''Jagd'' continued in service for another three years, after which she was withdrawn from service and used in various roles over the following sixteen years. She was sold for scrapping in 1920.

==Design==
The Imperial Navy began building small [[aviso]]s in the 1880s to serve in the main fleet in German waters. These vessels were intended to support the [[line of battle|battle line]], and so unlike the contemporary [[List of unprotected cruisers of Germany|German unprotected cruisers]], their designs emphasized offensive capability and high speed rather than a long cruising radius.<ref name=G249>Gardiner, p. 249</ref> The ''Wacht'' class followed the previous aviso, {{SMS|Greif}}. The ship had proved to be a disappointment in service, since it carried no torpedo armament. As a result, the ''Wacht'' design returned to the torpedo as its primary armament like earlier vessels such as the {{sclass-|Blitz|aviso|4}}.<ref>Gardiner, pp. 256&ndash;257</ref>

===General characteristics===

The ''Wacht''-class ships were {{convert|84|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|85.5|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.66|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|3.74|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|4.67|m|abbr=on}} aft. They displaced {{convert|1246|MT|sp=us}} as designed and up to {{convert|1499|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Their hulls were constructed from transverse steel frames.<ref name=G95>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 95</ref> ''Wacht'' and ''Jagd'' each had a crew of 7&nbsp;officers and 134&nbsp;enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including one picket boat, one [[yawl]], one [[dinghy]], and one [[cutter (boat)|cutter]]. They were poor sea boats; they rolled and pitched badly and were very wet. They were also not particularly maneuverable vessels.<ref name=G96>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 96</ref><ref name=G257>Gardiner, p. 257</ref>

===Machinery===
Their propulsion system consisted of two angled 3-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s that each drove a {{convert|3.3|m|abbr=on}} wide three-bladed screw. Steam for the engines was provided by four coal-fired [[locomotive boiler]]s trunked into a single [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] [[amidships]]. In 1891&ndash;93, new boilers manufactured by [[Schichau-Werke]] and the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] (Imperial Shipyard) in [[Wilhelmshaven]] were installed. The ships were equipped with a pair of [[electric generator]]s with a combined output of {{convert|20|kW}} at 67&nbsp;[[volt]]s.<ref name=G95/>

The ships' propulsion system provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|abbr=on}} and was rated at {{convert|4000|ihp|lk=in}}, though neither ship reached that horsepower in service. They carried up to {{convert|230|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, which enabled them to steam for approximately {{convert|2860|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}. Steering was controlled by a single rudder.<ref name=G95/>

===Armament and armor===
As built, the ships were armed with three [[10.5 cm K L/35 gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} K L/35]] guns placed in single pivot mounts. The guns were supplied with a total of 180 rounds of ammunition and had a range of {{convert|7000|m|abbr=on}}. ''Wacht'' and ''Jagd'' also carried three {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck-mounted launchers on the [[broadside]]. In 1891, four [[8.8 cm SK L/30 gun|8.8 cm SK L/30]] [[quick-firing gun]]s in single mounts replaced the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns.<ref name=G956>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 95&ndash;96</ref><ref name=G257/>

The ships were the first German aviso to carry armor: a {{convert|10|mm|abbr=on}} thick deck with {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} thick sloped sides protected the magazines and engine rooms. The [[conning tower]] was protected with {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}} of armor plating on the sides and 10&nbsp;mm on the roof. The [[coaming]] around the funnel was {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The armor consisted of [[compound armor|compound]] [[wrought iron]]. For protection against underwater attack, the hull was divided into twelve [[watertight compartment]]s below the armored deck and ten compartments above it.<ref name=G95/>

==Service history==
''Wacht'' and ''Jagd'' were both built by the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]]. ''Wacht'' was laid down in 1886 and ''Jagd'' followed in 1887. ''Wacht'' was launched on 27 August 1887 and commissioned into the German fleet on 9 August 1888 after [[fitting-out]] work was completed. ''Jagd'' was launched on 7 July 1888 and completed by 25 June 1889, when she was commissioned into the fleet.<ref name=G257/>

Both ''Wacht'' and ''Jagd'' served with the German fleet in home waters; ''Wacht'' in the Maneuver Squadron from 1889 and ''Jagd'' in the Training Squadron from 1891.<ref>Rodgers, p. 203</ref> ''Wacht'' and the rest of the Maneuver Squadron went on a major cruise in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in 1889&ndash;90.<ref>Sondhaus, p. 179</ref> In 1893, ''Jagd'' joined ''Wacht'' in the Maneuver Squadron, and both ships served there, alternating between the I and II Divisions for the rest of the decade. Their activities consisted of periodic divisional and squadron training maneuvers, which culminated in the annual autumn fleet maneuvers in late August and early September.<ref>"Naval and Military Notes", p. 814</ref><ref>Knepper, p. 128</ref><ref>Garbett, p. 1182</ref>

On 4 September 1901, ''Wacht'' accidentally collided with the ironclad {{SMS|Sachsen|1877|2}} during training exercises. ''Sachsen'', which was equipped with a [[naval ram|ram bow]], tore a hole in ''Wacht''{{'}}s hull below the waterline. The [[battleship]] {{SMS|Weissenburg||2}} attempted to tow ''Wacht'' to shallow water where she could be grounded, but the flooding proved to be impossible to control and ''Wacht'' quickly sank.<ref>"Naval Notes: Germany", pp. 1505<U+2013>1506</ref> ''Jagd'' meanwhile remained in service until 1904, when she was withdrawn and used as a harbor ship. She was stricken in May 1910 and subsequently [[hulk (ship)|hulked]]. Later, she was moved to [[Friedrichsort]], outside [[Kiel]], where she was used as a firing platform for torpedo training through [[World War I]]. In 1920, she was sold for scrap.<ref name=G96/>
