Captain '''Edward 'Ned' Low''' (also Lowe or Loe) was a notorious [[pirate]] during the latter days of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], in the early 18th century. A thief and a scoundrel from a young age, he was born into poverty in [[Westminster]], [[London]] in around 1690, and moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] as a young man. Following the death of his wife during childbirth in late 1719, he became a pirate two years later, operating off the coasts of [[New England]], the [[Azores]], and in the [[Caribbean]]. 

He captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career of piracy, burning most of them.<ref name="guide"/> Although he was only active for three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing them.<ref name="portcities">{{cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.57/chapterId/1004/London-and-the-pirates.html|title=London and the Pirates|accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref> Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], in his work ''The Green Flag'', described Low as "savage and desperate", and a man of "amazing and grotesque brutality".<ref name="acd">{{cite book|title=The Green Flag|author=[[Arthur Conan Doyle|Doyle, Arthur Conan]]|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10446/10446.txt |chapter=III|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|origyear=1900}}</ref> The circumstances of death, in around 1724, have been the subject of much speculation.

==Early life==

According to [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Charles Johnson's]] ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', Edward Low was born in [[Westminster]], [[London]], [[England]], in the late [[17th century]].<ref name="pyrates">{{cite book |author=[[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Johnson, Charles]]|title= [[A General History of the Pyrates]] |origyear= 1742|publisher= Courier Dover|language= English|isbn=0486404889 |pages= 318-336|chapter=Chap.

As a young man, he was a [[pickpocket]] and gambler, playing games of chance with the footmen of the nearby [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].<ref name="pyrates"/> Even at a young age, he was of a "quarrelsome nature", always ready to cheat.<ref name="own">{{cite book | first=Charles | last=Ellms| title=The Pirates Own Book: Authentic Narratives of the Most Celebrated Sea Robbers |origyear =1837|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]| language=English|chapter=The Life of Edward Low.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12216/12216-h/12216-h.htm#THE_LIFE_OF_CAPTAIN_EDWARD_LOW}}</ref>

==Life in Boston==

As he grew older, Low tired of pickpocketing and [[Theft|thievery]], and engaged in [[burglary]]. Eventually, he left England, and travelled alone to the [[New World]] in around 1710. He spent three to four years in various locations, before settling in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="new1"/> In Boston, he married Eliza Marble in August 1714 at the First Church of Boston. They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719.<ref name="new1"/> 

Eliza died in labour, leaving Low with his daughter.<ref name="pyrates"/> The loss of his wife had a profound affect on Low<U+2014>in his later, bloodthirsty career, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to [[pressgang]] married men into joining his crews.<ref name="new1"/> At first working honestly as a [[Rigging|rigger]], in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a [[sloop]] headed for [[Honduras]], where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.<ref name="pyrates"/><ref name="own"/>

Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. He came back aboard hungry one day, but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of [[rum]]. At this, Low "took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot another poor fellow through the throat".<ref name="bay">{{cite web|title=When Pirates Rules...|url=http://www.bayislandsvoice.com/issue-v3-3.htm|author=Harper, Matthew|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Bay Islands Voice|year=2005|month=March}}</ref> Following this failed [[mutiny]], Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day later, Low led the twelve man gang &ndash; which included [[Francis Spriggs|Francis Farrington Spriggs]] &ndash; in taking over a small sloop, killing one man, and officially turned pirate determined "to go in her, make a black Flag and declare War against all the World."<ref name="pyrates"/>

==Piracy==
===Lieutenant===

Low was an immediate success as a pirate. He began his piracy in the waters of the [[Cayman Islands|Grand Caymans]], with a short period as [[lieutenant]] to the established pirate [[George Lowther (pirate)|George Lowther]], who captained the ''Happy Delivery''.<ref name="guide"/><ref name="bucc">{{cite book |last=Stockton |first=Frank Richard|title=Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts| origyear=1897|publisher=Macmillian Books|language=English|isbn=0027885208|pages=263-277|chapter=XXIX - A Pirate from Boyhood|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17188/17188-h/17188-h.htm}}</ref> The ''Happy Delivery'' was a 100-ton Rhode Island sloop, with eight [[cannon]] and ten swivel guns. It was "destroyed by Indians" (given the location, these were almost certainly [[Ta<U+00ED>no]], inhabitants of the [[Greater Antilles]], which included the Caymans), and Lowther and his crew transferred to a sloop named the ''Ranger''. Lowther's crew was constantly being increased by desperate sailors willing to join him.<ref name="ossian">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/low_edward.htm|title=Edward Low|author=Rob Ossian|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Acquiring a taste for cruelty, Low taught Spriggs a torture technique which involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting them alight, burning their flesh down to the bones.<ref name="bay"/>

{{rquote|right|Of all the pyratical crews that were ever heard of, none of the English name came up to this, in barbarity. Their mirth and their anger had much the same effect, for both were usually gratified with the cries and groans of their prisoners; so that they almost as often murdered a man from the excess of good humour, as out of passion and resentment; and the unfortunate could never be assured of safety from them, for danger lurked in their very smiles|[[Philip Ashton]] on his time with Low's crew.<ref name="desperate"/>}}

Following a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captained a large 6-gun [[brigantine]] (named ''Rebecca'') on [[28 May]] 1722.<ref name="pyrates"/> He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther.<ref name="bucc"/> 

===Pirate captain===

In one notable raid in June, he attacked thirteen New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway ([[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]). Although outnumbered, Low hoisted the black flag and declared that no quarter would be given if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed each vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-[[ton]] [[schooner]] which he renamed ''The Fancy'' and armed with 10 guns, to become his [[flagship]].<ref name="guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.chronofus.net/wargames/piracy/captains/low.htm|title=Guide to Edward Low|accessdate=2007-09-27}} - bibliography for data: [http://www.chronofus.net/wargames/piracy/bibliography.htm]</ref> 

He sank the other ships of the fleet, and abandoned the ''Rebecca''. The ''Boston News Letter'' of 9 July 1722 published a list of those captured by Low.<ref name="desperate">{{cite book|author=Edward E. Leslie|title=Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls|origyear=1998|pages=86-87|language=English|isbn=0395911508}} Some content available on [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X0_S5AtHuY0C&pg=PA86&sig=uwxzwVAi8T4lCAa-wFzVYEV_oM0#PPA87,M1]</ref> A number of the fishermen were [[pressgang|forced to join]] Low, including [[Philip Ashton]] who escaped in May 1723 on [[Roat<U+00E1>n]] Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and who wrote a detailed account of life aboard Low's pirate ship.<ref name="guide"/><ref name="drake">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zeXgU9ujuSoC&pg=PA213&dq=%22Ned+Low%22&as_brr=1&ei=9jb9RuzoIojm6wLJ-qjlDQ&sig=1P_tuA5C3vBccoxj39CFpjlgGpo#PPA214,M1|title=New England Legends and Folk Lore|author=Samuel Adams Drake|origyear=1833|publisher=[[Google Books]]|language=English}}</ref> Before Ashton's escape, he had been beaten, whipped, kept in chains, and threatened with death many times, as he refused to sign Low's articles and become a pirate.<ref name="new"/>

Low's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting [[false colours]] and approaching an unsuspecting vessel.<ref name="bay"/> Off the coast of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], Low mistook a fully-armed [[man of war]] for a fishing boat, and barely escaped.<ref name="drake"/> He moved on to [[Conception Bay]], captured a number of boats around the [[Grand Banks]] southeast of Newfoundland, before crossing the Atlantic to the [[Azores]]. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese - sources differ) [[pink (ship)|pink]], a narrow-sterned former man of war which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the ''Rose Pink''.<ref name="new2"/> He moved on to the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], [[Cape Verde]] and then back across to the coast of [[Brazil]], where he was driven back by foul weather.<ref name="drake"/>

Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. A mate on the British ship ''King Sagamore'', George Roberts, recounted a meeting with Low aboard the "''Pink''". Roberts' ship was captured by Low's fleet, of which he was now styling himself "Commodore".<ref name="new2">{{cite book |author=George Francis Dow and John Henry Edmonds|title= The Pirates of the New England Coast, 1630-1730 |origyear= 1923|publisher= Courier Dover|language=English|isbn=0486290646|pages=157-199|chapter=XI - Captain Roberts' Account of what Happened on Low's Ship}} Some content available on [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=0kEftr23bFAC&pg=RA1-PA141&lpg=RA1-PA141&dq=%22ned+low%22+pirate&source=web&ots=OtXQ11XSW8&sig=ho73o8LCuDnIVzJGhb39Lr9M56s#PPR8,M1].</ref>

===Capsizing of the Rose Pink===
Forty [[League (unit)|leagues]] (around 120 [[nautical mile]]s) to the east of [[Surinam]], Low and his fleet of two ships (the ''Rose Pink'' and the ''Fancy'', captained by a young [[Charles Harris (pirate)|Charles Harris]]) weighed anchor to remove growth such as [[seaweed]] and [[barnacles]] from the outside of the boats, in a process known as [[careening]], necessary because no [[dry dock]] was available to pirates. Still relatively inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the ''Rose Pink'' tipped over too far. The [[porthole]]s had been left open, and the vessel took on too much water and sank, with the death of two men. The ''Pink'' had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low &ndash; now captaining a [[schooner]] &ndash; and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint per man, per day.<ref name="new3">{{cite book |author=George Francis Dow and John Henry Edmonds|title= The Pirates of the New England Coast, 1630-1730 |origyear= 1923|publisher= Courier Dover|language=English|isbn=0486290646|pages=200-217|chapter=XII - The Brutal Career and Miserable End of Ned Low}} Some content available on [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=0kEftr23bFAC&pg=RA1-PA141&lpg=RA1-PA141&dq=%22ned+low%22+pirate&source=web&ots=OtXQ11XSW8&sig=ho73o8LCuDnIVzJGhb39Lr9M56s#PPR8,M1].</ref> 

Failing to reach their initial destination of [[Tobago]] due to light winds and strong [[current]]s, Low's depleted fleet made it to [[Grenada]], a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. With Low in command of the captured sloop (renamed the ''Ranger''), he gave the schooner (named the ''Squirrel'') to his [[quartermaster]], [[Francis Spriggs|Spriggs]], who renamed it the ''Delight'' before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.<ref name="spriggs">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/spriggs_francis.htm|title=Francis Spriggs|author=Rob Ossian|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref>

===Early 1723===
[[Image:The Cruelties practised by Captain Low.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Cruelties practised by Captain Low'', from ''A Pirate's Own Book'' (1837)]]
The new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the ''Fortune''. In a later trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low's crew, a sailor on board the ''Fortune'' named John Welland recalled Low stripped his boat, including gold to the value of <U+00A3>150, then beat him and cut off his ear with a cutlass.<ref name="memo">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_mcBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA267&dq=%22Edward+Low%22&as_brr=1&ei=Rjv9RvPDCoXy6gKTsr3lDQ#PPA267,M1|origyear=1833|author=Updike, Wilkins|pages=|title=Memoirs of the Rhode Island Bar|chapter=Appendix|language=English|pages=260-294}} - recount of the trial of many of Low's men, including verdict and witness statements, and Low's articles.</ref> 

Following this, Low's fleet captured a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship called the ''Nostra Signoria de Victoria'' on 25 January 1723. The ''Victoria's'' Portuguese captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold [[moidore]]s (worth at the time around [[GBP|<U+00A3>]]15,000) to fall into the sea rather than see it be captured.<ref name="new3"/> One of Low's most particularly noted episodes of cruelty occurred then; in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's lips with a [[cutlass]], [[broiling|broiled]] them, and forced the victim to eat them while still hot.<ref name="own"/><ref name="new3"/> He then murdered the remaining crew.<ref name="guide"/> Low's own men described him as "a maniac and a brute".<ref name="new">{{cite web|url=http://www.piratemuseum.com/edbiogra.htm|title=Pirate Biography|publisher=New England Pirate Museum|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> 

A famous story describes Low burning a French cook alive, saying he was a "greasy fellow who would fry well", and another tells he once killed 53 Spanish captives with his [[cutlass]].<ref name="own"/> Some historians, including [[David Cordingly]], believe this was deliberately done to cultivate a ferocious image.<ref name="potcdvd">{{cite video |people= [[David Cordingly|Cordingly, David]] |date2= 2003-12-02 |title= [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]] DVD extra |medium= DVD|publisher= [[Walt Disney Pictures]]|quote=My theory is that he deliberately cultivated a terrifying image, because it made their life easier - when they came up beside somebody, ran up the Jolly Roger flag, hopefully everybody would surrender without a fight. So, I think that was part of it, this terror image cultivated by torture and nasty things.}}</ref> Historian Edward Leslie described Low as a [[psychopath]] with a history filled with "mutilations, disembowelings, decapitations, and slaughter".<ref name="desperate"/> One failed [[torture]] session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.<ref name="pyrates"/>

A [[snow (ship)|snow]] called the ''Unity'' was added to the fleet, and used as a tender (a cargo ship), but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war called the ''Mermaid''.<ref name="guide"/> As Low's success increased in the [[Caribbean]], so did his notoriety. Eventually, a [[bounty]] was placed on his head, and Low headed for the Azores, again teaming up again with [[Charles Harris (pirate)|Charles Harris]]. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by now had taken special notice of Edward Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.<ref name="own"/>

===Defeat and death===
[[Image:Low presenting a Pistol and Bowl of Punch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Low presenting a Pistol and Bowl of Punch'', from ''A Pirate's Own Book'' (1837).]]

Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the [[Carolinas]]. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with {{HMS|Greyhound}}, a heavily-armed [[man of war]].<ref name="bucc"/> The ''Greyhound'' had been despatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the ''Fancy'' with a [[skeleton crew]] and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the ''Ranger'' behind.<ref name="own"/> Twenty-five of the crew of the ''Ranger'', including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July, with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle.<ref name="memo"/> The men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near [[Newport, Rhode Island]], on 19 July 1723.<ref name="guide"/><ref name="bucc"/> Harris returned to the UK, and was hanged at [[Wapping]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=P|title=The Pirates' Who's Who, Giving Particulars Of The Lives and Deaths Of The Pirates And Buccaneers|pages=155|publisher=Lenox Hill|origyear=1968}}</ref>

Low, still captaining the ''Fancy'', captured a 22-gun French ship and a large [[Virginia]]n merchant vessel, the ''Merry Christmas'', in late June 1723. His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with [[George Lowther (pirate)|George Lowther]] in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the ''Delight'' off the coast of [[Guinea]], mounting 14 guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the ''Merry Christmas'', by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.<ref name="pyrates"/>

There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Edward Low's death. [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Johnson]]  &ndash; considered to be [[Daniel Defoe]] writing under a [[pseudonym]]<ref name="flag">{{cite book|author=[[David Cordingly|Cordingly, David]]|title=Under the Black Flag|pages=xix|origyear=1996|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0156005492}}</ref> &ndash; stated in his ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', at odds with other sources, that Edward Low and the ''Fancy'' were last sighted near the [[Canaries]] and [[Guinea]]. They were never heard of again, and it was believed that his ship sank in a storm, with the loss of all hands.<ref name="pyrates"/> The [[National Maritime Museum]] in London states that he was never caught, ending his days in [[Brazil]].<ref name="portcities"/>

''The Pirates Own Book'' and Ossian agree that Low was sent adrift without provisions by the crew of the ''Merry Christmas'', in a [[mutiny]] brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument.<ref name="ossian"/> Low was rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in [[Martinique]], in 1724.<ref name="own"/>

==Flags==
[[Image:Edward Low Flag.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[pirate flag]] used by Edward Low.]]
Initially, Low used the same [[pirate flag|flag]] as Edward Teach. Later, he used his own flag, which became notorious &ndash; a red [[skeleton|skeletal figure]] on a black background.<ref name="psite">{{cite web|url=http://www.piratesinfo.com/main.php|title=Pirates Site|accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> He first flew his own flag in late July 1723.<ref name="pyrates"/> 

Low also used a green [[silk]] flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this ''Green Trumpeter'' was hoisted on the [[mizzen]] peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.<ref name="guide"/>

===Articles===

Low had a set of ''[[Pirate code of the Brethren|articles]]'', forming a [[code of conduct]].<ref name="memo"/> The articles listed below are attributed by the [[Boston News-Letter]] to Low. The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to [[George Lowther (pirate)|Lowther]] by Defoe.<ref name="pyrates"/> It is probable that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an ''[[ordonnance]]'', or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.

Edward Low is remembered as one of the most notorious and bloodthirsty pirates. His murderous and brutal acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such as [[Edward Teach]] ("Blackbeard"), [[Bartholomew Roberts]] ("Black Bart"), and [[William Fly]], led to a great increase in military presence to protect shipping lanes, and the effective end of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].<ref name="rediker">{{cite book|author=Rediker, Marcus|title=Villains of all Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age|publisher=Verso|origyear=2004|isbn=1844670082}} Some content available at [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jQyoDRbGgucC]</ref>

By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal, following the end of a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of [[privateer]]s. [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Pirates based in the Caribbean]] were chased from the seas by a new British [[Royal Navy]] squadron based at [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]] and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the [[Spanish Main]], known as the Costa Garda (Coast Guard in English).<ref name="rediker"/>
[[Image:Lowstamp.jpg|thumb|left|A 1975 [[Cayman Islands]] 30c stamp featuring Low.]]
Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and [[Stede Bonnet]]. [[Howard Pyle]], in an 1880 children's book on pirates, said: "No one stood higher in the trade than [Low], and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written and sung of this man of might, for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard."<ref name="pyle">{{cite book|title=Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates|author=[[Howard Pyle|Pyle, Howard]]|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/973/973-h/973-h.htm|origdate=1903|language=English}}</ref>
