Green  was [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs|New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner]] from 1990 to 1993 and was twice elected [[New York City Public Advocate]], in 1993 and 1997.  He also won Democratic [[Primary election|primaries]] for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and [[Mayor of New York City]] and in each case lost in the general election.

==Early life==
Green was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]]. Green lived in [[Bensonhurst]] until he was three and then moved to Long Island, first to [[Elmont, New York]] and later [[Great Neck, New York]]. Both his parents were Republicans, his father was a lawyer and residential apartment landlord and his mother was a public-school teacher.<ref name= NYTDifferent>[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/13/nyregion/different-lives-different-politics-but-greens-unite-in-mayor-s-race.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm New York Times: "Different Lives, Different Politics, But Greens Unite in Mayor's Race" By ERIC LIPTON] August 13, 2001</ref> He graduated from [[Great Neck South High School]] in [[Great Neck, New York]] in 1963.<ref>[http://www.greatneck.k12.ny.us/GNPS/Pages/famous/famous60.html "Great Neck Alumni"], Great Neck school district website</ref> He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1967 and from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1970, where he was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-green The Huffington Post: Mark Green] retrieved June 24, 2012</ref> Green is [[Jews|Jewish]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-green/the-right-wing-attempt-to_b_1030562.html The Huffinton Post: "The Right-Wing Smears OWS With Anti-Semitism" by Mark Green] October 25, 2011</ref><ref name= NYTGiuliani>[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/nyregion/for-giuliani-and-green-it-might-as-well-be-1997.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm New York Times: "For Giuliani and Green, It Might as Well Be 1997" By ALISON MITCHELL] June 11, 1994</ref> He has one brother,  realtor [[Stephen L.

==Political career==

=== 1970s ===
[[Image:Mark Green 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Mark Green at a Ralph Nader speech in [[New York City]]]]During the 1970s, Green was a "Nader's Raider" at Ralph Nader's Public Citizen.  There he worked on a lawsuit [[lawsuit]] against the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] after the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox,{{Specify|date=August 2009|reason=What lawsuit, what role?|post-text=?}} and later ran Public Citizen's [[Congress Watch]] (1977<U+2013>1980), the largest consumer rights lobby in Washington.

=== 1980s ===
The growing power of the [[political action committee]]s (PACs) in the early 1980s stirred up discussion about the inevitability of political corruption, from "[[Special interest groups|special interests]]" buying votes. [[Common Cause]] the citizens' lobby, and other groups organized to abolish PACs.  Green, then known as a consumer and political activist, denounced PACs as <U+201C>legalized bribery,<U+201D> and set up a PAC to end all PACs; it was called "UnPAC".<ref>Edward Tivnan, ''The Lobby; Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy'', 1987, p.193. ISBN 0-671-50153-4</ref>  During his later campaign for Senator from New York in 1986, Green set an example for other candidates by refusing to take money from special interest groups' PACs.<ref>''[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/opinion/topics-investments-returned-unpac.html Topics; Investments Returned; UnPAC]'', May 1, 1986, [[The New York Times]], Editorial Desk</ref>

Green first ran for [[public office]] in 1980.  He won a Democratic [[primary election]] to represent the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side of Manhattan]] in the House of Representatives, then lost to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent, [[Bill Green (New York politician)|Bill Green]] (not related).

In 1981, Mark Green founded the New Democracy Project, with songwriter Harry Chapin, a [[public policy]] institute in New York City; he ran it for 10 years. During the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]], he served as chief [[speechwriter]] for Democratic candidate Senator [[Gary Hart]], who ran second in the primaries.

In 1986 Green won the Democratic nomination for the Senate against [[multimillionaire]] John Dyson, even though he was outspent 10-1. Dyson remained on the ballot as the candidate of the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]]. Green lost the [[general election]] to [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Al D'Amato|Alfonse D'Amato]] and later filed a formal ethics complaint in the Senate Ethics Committee against D'Amato that resulted in the Senator being reprimanded by the United States Senate.

=== 1990s ===
From 1990 to 1993, Green was Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City. He was elected the first [[New York City Public Advocate]] in 1993,<ref name= NYTGiuliani /> and re-elected in 1997. In that office, Green led investigations of [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]], hospitals, and nursing homes which led to fines by the [[New York State Attorney General]]. A 1994 investigation on the [[Bell Regulations]] ("Libby Zion Law") -- limiting resident working hours and requiring physician supervision<U+2014>and follow-up study prompted the [[New York State Department of Health]] to crack down on violating hospitals. He also led an effort against tobacco advertising aimed at children, enacting a law banning cigarette vending machines and released a series of expos<U+00E9>s and legal actions against [[tobacco advertising]] targeted at children<U+2014>concluding that [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] was engaged in "commercial child abuse"<U+2014>which culminated in a 1997 [[Federal Trade Commission]] decision that ended the [[Joe Camel]] ads.

As Public Advocate, Green first proposed the 311 complaint help line that Mayor Bloomberg later implemented. He wrote laws that matched small donations w/ multiple city funds, created the Voter Commission, upheld the legality of the Independent Budget Office,  barred stores from charging women more than men for the same services, and that prohibited companies from firing female employees merely because they were victims of domestic violence. He started the City's first web site, NYC.Gov  that he later gave to City Hall where it is still the main portal for City government.

One of his most high-profile accomplishments  was a lawsuit to obtain information about [[racial profiling]] in [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s [[NYPD|police force]]. As Green told the ''[[Gotham Gazette]]'', "We sued Mayor Giuliani because he was in deep denial about racial profiling. [After winning the case, we] released an investigation showing a pattern of unpunished misconduct ... [and] the rate that police with substantiated complaints are punished went from 25 percent to 75 percent." Green was one of the first public officials to draw attention to racial profiling by the NYPD, which, until 2001, made him an enemy of Mayor Giuliani and one of the most popular white politicians among New York City [[African American]]s.

Green ran for the U.S. Senate again in 1998, when D'Amato was seeking a fourth term. Green finished third in the Democratic primary behind the winner, Congressman [[Charles Schumer]], and 1984 Democratic [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee [[Geraldine Ferraro]].

Despite Green's personal ties to Nader, he did not support [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|Nader's presidential campaigns]].  In [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 campaign]] he praised Nader's work as a consumer advocate but he endorsed Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]].<ref>{{Cite news| last = Ramirez| first = Anthony| title = Metro Briefing| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = September 1, 2000| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4DD1230F932A3575AC0A9669C8B63&scp=2&sq=Nader+Mark+Green&st=nyt| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> In 2004, Green was co-chair of the New York presidential campaign of Senator [[John Kerry]].

===2001 race for Mayor===
{{Main|New York City mayoral election, 2001}}
Green ran for [[Mayor of New York City]] and won the Democratic nomination in 2001 but lost to [[Michael Bloomberg]] 50% - 48% in the closest NYC mayoral election in a century. Green had narrowly defeated [[Fernando Ferrer]] in the primary, surviving a negative contest that divided the party. The two other candidates were Council Speaker [[Peter Vallone]] and City Comptroller [[Alan Hevesi]].

The [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] occurred on the morning of the Democratic primary and contributed to Green's loss.  Also, Bloomberg spent an unprecedented $74 million in his campaign, especially on TV ads and direct mail. [[Rudy Giuliani]], who suddenly had an extremely high popularity publicly endorsed Bloomberg.<ref>Nagourney, Adam. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E6DF1630F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63 "Bloomberg Puts Eggs In a Basket: Giuliani's"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 28, 2001. Accessed December 31, 2007. "Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to endorse Michael R. Bloomberg at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] yesterday provides Mr. Bloomberg with perhaps his greatest hope for victory as he moves into the final days of what his supporters describe as a troubled campaign."</ref>

Additionally, Green made a controversial decision during the primary to support Giuliani's unprecedented attempt to extend his own mayoral term, in the name of the emergency of 9/11. Ferrer opposed Giuliani's ultimately unsuccessful attempt at term self-extension and was able to accuse Green of being rolled over by Giuliani.

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote, "The billionaire businessman [Bloomberg] is usually seen as one of the post<U+2013>September 11th winners (if such a word can be so used): he would probably have lost the mayoralty to Mark Green, a leftish Democrat, had the terrorist strike not happened. Yet it is also worth noting that his election probably spared New York City a turbulent period of score-settling over Rudy Giuliani's legacy."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1328844 |title=New York's difficult year |work=[[The Economist]] |date=September 12, 2002|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> Chris Smith in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' wrote in 2011, "Many old-school Democrats believe that Bloomberg's 2001 victory over Mark Green was a terrorist-provoked, money-soaked aberration."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymag/rss/all/mayoral-election-2011-11/index4.html|title=Who Will Win the 2013 Mayoral Election?|author=Smith, Chris|work=New York Magazine|date=Nov. 7, 2011|accessdate=Aug. 13, 2013}}</ref>

Green was criticized by the Ferrer campaign for the actions of supporters in the Run-off that were construed as racist, involving literature with ''[[New York Post]]'' caricatures of Ferrer and [[Al Sharpton]] distributed in white enclaves of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]]. Green stated that he had nothing to do with the dissemination of the literature.  An investigation by the [[district attorney]] of [[Kings County, New York]] (Brooklyn) [[Charles J. Hynes]] came to the conclusion that "Mark Green had no knowledge of these events, and that when he learned of them, he repeatedly denounced the distribution of this literature and sought to find out who had engaged in it."<ref>Katz, Nancie L., [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2006-07-22/news/18339210_1_hynes-mark-green-campaign-committee-friends "Green Cleared In Campaign Flap"], ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', July 22, 2006. Retrieved 2011-06-28.</ref> Nevertheless, the incident kept Ferrer from endorsing the Democratic nominee and is thought to have diminished minority turnout in the general election which helped the Republican candidate win in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.

Green wrote an article about the campaign a decade later in the 9/11 anniversary issue of ''New York Magazine''.[http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/mark-green/ <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>] in which he reported that Bloomberg told him in 2002 that "I wouldn't have won" without Ferrer's late campaign opposition to Green.

===2006 race for state Attorney General===
{{Main|New York attorney general election, 2006}}
Green ran in the Democratic primary for [[New York State Attorney General]] in 2006.  He faced former [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Secretary [[Andrew Cuomo]], former White House Staff Secretary [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], and former [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]] candidate [[Charles King (New York)|Charles King]] in the primary. Green did not receive the required 25% at the state Democratic convention to earn a spot on the primary ballot and therefore had to circulate nominating petitions statewide to be on the September ballot.  He was required to submit at least 15,000 valid signatures; on July 13, he submitted more than 40,000 signatures. He held several endorsements of note, including former NYC Mayor [[David Dinkins]], [[Brooklyn]] [[borough president|Borough President]] [[Marty Markowitz]], the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', and the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.

On September 12, 2006, Green lost to Andrew Cuomo in his bid to secure the Democratic nomination to succeed then-Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]].<ref>[http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&aid=62538 "Clinton, Spitzer, Spencer, Cuomo Advance In Primaries"], ''[[NY1]]''. Accessed December 31, 2007.</ref> On the evening the results came in, he vowed to reporters that "I won't be running for office again. But I'll continue to advocate, write and teach."

Cuomo beat the Republican candidate, former [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]].

===2009 race for Public Advocate===
{{Main|New York City Public Advocate election, 2009}}
On February 10, 2009, Green announced that he would again run for the office of Public Advocate.<ref>[http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/Default.aspx "Mark Green Announces Candidacy For Public Advocate"], ''[[NY1]]''. Accessed February 10, 2009.</ref> His Director of Policy was [[Benjamin Kallos]], with whom he worked on "100 Ideas for a Better City".<ref>{{cite news|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|title=Kallos Joins Green Campaign|url=http://ot.nypress.com/?p=2721|newspaper=Our Town East Side: Upper East Side News & Community|date=April 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Anna |url=http://gothamschools.org/2009/11/02/would-a-uft-endorsement-for-thompson-make-a-difference/ |title=Would a UFT endorsement for Thompson make a difference? |publisher=Gotham Schools |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Paybarah |first=Azi |url=http://observer.com/2009/06/another-transparency-web-site/ |title=Another Transparency Web Site |publisher=The New York Observer |date= June 15, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>  As one of the top two finishers in the Democratic primary, Green qualified for the September 29 runoff, but lost to City Councilmember [[Bill de Blasio]] who went on to win the mayoralty in 2013.
