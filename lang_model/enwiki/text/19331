{{History of Scotland}}
'''Scotland during the Roman Empire''' encompasses a period of [[protohistory]] from the arrival of Roman legions in c. AD 71 to their departure in 213. The history of the period is complex: the [[Roman empire]] influenced every part of Scotland during the period, however the occupation was neither complete nor continuous. Analysis and interpretation is further complicated by the fact that the idea of both "[[Scottish people|Scots]]" and of "[[Scotland]]" as a discrete entity did not emerge until [[Origins of the Kingdom of Alba|centuries later]]. The period is marked by the appearance of the first [[protohistory|historical accounts]] of the peoples of Scotland, as well as by extensive, if at times inconclusive, archaeological evidence.

Throughout this time the geographical area of Scotland was occupied by several different tribes utilising [[Iron Age]] technology with a wide variety of relationships both to one another and to Ancient Rome. The Romans gave the name ''[[Caledonia]]'' to the land north of their [[Roman provinces|province]] of ''[[Roman Britain|Britannia]]'', beyond the [[Frontiers of the Roman Empire|frontier]] of the empire. Although the Roman presence was an important time in [[Scottish history]], not least because it was when written records first emerged, Roman influence on [[Scottish culture]] was not enduring.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 226. "The Romans left us nothing of any enduring cultural value. Their presence in Scotland was brief, intermittent and not influential on the course of our history."</ref>

The Roman invasion under [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] began in AD 71 and culminated in the battle of [[Mons Graupius]] at an unknown location in northern Scotland in AD 84. Although the [[Caledonians|Caledonia Confederacy]] suffered a defeat it was not long before the legions abandoned their territorial gains and returned to a line south of the [[Solway Firth]], later consolidated by the construction of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Roman commanders subsequently made various attempts to conquer territory to the north of this line, including the building of the [[Antonine Wall]] and the later Severan campaigns but their success was similarly short-lived. Roman forces ceased to have a significant impact after 211. By the close of the Roman occupation of southern and central Britain in the fifth century the [[Picts]] had emerged as the dominant force in northern Scotland, with the various [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] tribes the Romans had first encountered there occupying the southern half of the country.

==The dawn of Scottish history==
[[File:Scotland topographic map-en.jpg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Scotland]]
Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only towards the Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing.

In the 4th century BC [[Aristotle]] knew of "Albinn" and "Ierne" (the islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]).<ref>[http://www.albawest.com/scots.html "The Scottish People: Albinn"] Albawest.com Retrieved 23 July 2008.</ref> The Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his ''On the Ocean'' Pytheas refers to the most northerly point as ''Orcas'', conceivably a reference to [[Orkney]].<ref>Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13.</ref>

The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the "King of Orkney" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor [[Claudius]] at [[Camulodunum|Colchester]] in AD 43 following the [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of southern Britain]] three months earlier.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 173-4.</ref><ref>Thomson (2008) pp. 4-5 suggests that there may have been an element of Roman "boasting" involved, given that it was known to them that the ''Orcades'' lay at the northern extremity of the British Isles.</ref> The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later [[Caledonia]]n resistance is striking.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 174-6.</ref> Originals of ''On the Ocean'' do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century AD so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 230.</ref><ref>Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 11.</ref> [[Pomponius Mela]], the Roman geographer, recorded in his ''De Chorographia'', written circa AD 43, that there were 30 [[List of Orkney islands|Orkney islands]] and seven ''Haemodae'' (possibly [[List of Shetland islands|Shetland]]).<ref name= B12>Breeze, David J. "The ancient geography of Scotland" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 12.</ref> There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to 60 AD from pottery found at the [[broch]] of [[Broch of Gurness|Gurness]].<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 173-4.</ref>

By the time of [[Pliny the Elder]], who died in AD 79, Roman knowledge of the geography of Scotland had extended to the ''Hebudes'' ([[The Hebrides]]), ''Dumna'' (probably the [[Outer Hebrides]]), the [[Caledonian Forest]] and the [[Caledonians|Caledonii]].<ref name= B12/>

[[Ptolemy]], possibly drawing on earlier sources of information as well as more contemporary accounts from the [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricolan]] invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his ''Geography'', but many of the names are obscure and the geography becomes less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea.<ref name= B12/><ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 236-37.</ref>

==Iron Age culture in Scotland==
[[File:Scotland Glenelg broch.jpg|thumb|Dun Telve broch in [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]]]]

Ptolemy's tribes located north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus include the [[Cornovii (Caithness)|Cornovii]] in [[Caithness]], the Caereni, Smertae, Carnonacae, Decantae, Lugi and Creones also north of the [[Great Glen]], the [[Taexali]] in the north-east, the [[Epidii]] in [[Argyll]], the [[Venicones]] in [[Fife]], the Caledonii in the central [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the Vacomagi centred near [[Strathmore]]. It is likely that all of these cultures spoke a form of [[Celtic language]] known as [[Pritennic]]. The occupants of southern Scotland were the [[Damnonii]] in the Clyde valley, the [[Novantae]] in Galloway, the [[Selgovae]] on the south coast and the [[Votadini]] to the east. These peoples may have spoken a form of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] language.

Despite the discovery of many hundreds of [[Iron Age]] sites in Scotland there is still a great deal that remains to be explained about the nature of the [[Celts|Celtic]] life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately [[radiocarbon dating]] for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood.<ref>Smith and Banks (2002) p. 219.</ref> For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and [[Northern Isles|north]] and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.<ref>Smith and Banks (2002) p. 218 and p. 220.</ref>

The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 BC to AD 300 with the most imposing structures having been created circa 200&ndash;100 BC. The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5&nbsp;m (21&nbsp;ft) in height.<ref>Armit (2003) p. 55.</ref> There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland.<ref>Armit (2003) p. 16. Euan MacKie has proposed a total of 104, although The [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] identify a total of 571 candidate sites.</ref> Despite extensive research, their purpose and the nature of the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.<ref>Smith and Banks (2002) p. 218</ref>

In some parts of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of recorded history right up to the present day, there does not seem to have been an [[social hierarchy|hierarchical elite]]. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as [[Barra]] and [[North Uist]]. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.<ref>Armit, Ian "Land and freedom: Implications of Atlantic Scottish settlement patterns for Iron Age land-holding and social organisation." in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 15-26.</ref>

Over 400 [[souterrain]]s have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.<ref>Miket, Roger "The souterrains of Skye" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 77-110.</ref>
[[File:TySkyeOldManOfStorr20030828r23f07.jpg|thumb|"A gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands"]]
Scotland also has numerous [[vitrified fort]]s but again an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near [[Forfar]] in [[Angus]], using a variety of techniques, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BC, or the mid-1st millennium AD. The lack of Roman artefacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.<ref>Alexander, Derek "The oblong fort at Finavon, Angus" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 45-54.</ref>

Unlike the earlier [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s, which have provided massive monuments to the dead, Iron Age burial sites in Scotland are rare, and a recent find at [[Dunbar]] may provide further insight into the culture of this period. A similar site of a warrior's grave at [[Alloa]] has been provisionally dated to AD 90&ndash;130.<ref>Smith and Banks (2002) p. 220.</ref><ref>[http://www.aocarchaeology.com/field-archaeology/dunbar.htm "The Dunbar Iron Age Warrior Grave"] AOC.

Retrieved 14 July 2008.</ref> A traveller called [[Demetrius of Tarsus]] related to [[Plutarch]] the tale of an expedition to the west coast in or shortly before AD 83. He stated that it was "a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands", but that he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the [[druids]] nor the name of the island.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 239-40.</ref>

==The invasion of Caledonia==
{{See also|Caledonians}}
[[File:Agricola.Campaigns.80.84.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
The apparently cordial beginnings recorded in Colchester did not last. We know nothing of the foreign policies of the senior leaders in mainland Scotland in the first century, but by AD 71 the [[List of Roman governors of Britain|Roman governor]] [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] had launched an invasion.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 229.</ref> The Votadini, who occupied the south-east of Scotland, came under Roman sway at an early stage and Cerialis sent one [[Division (military)|division]] north through their territory to the shores of the [[Firth of Forth]]. The XXth Legion took a western route through [[Annandale, Dumfries and Galloway|Annandale]] in an attempt to encircle and isolate the Selgovae who occupied the central [[Southern Uplands]].<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 230-31.</ref><ref>Moffat (2005) p. 247.</ref> Early success tempted Cerialis further north and he began constructing a line of [[Glenblocker fort]]s to the north and west of the [[Gask Ridge]] which marked a frontier between the [[Venicones]] to the south and the Caledonii to the north.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 233.</ref>

In the summer of AD 78 [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor. Two years later his legions constructed a substantial [[Roman fort|fort]] at [[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]] near [[Melrose, Scottish Borders|Melrose]]. Excavations in the 20th century produced significant finds including the foundations of several successive structures, [[Roman coins]] and [[pottery]]. Remains from the [[Roman army]] were also found, including a collection of Roman [[armour]] (with ornate cavalry parade helmets), and horse fittings (with bronze saddleplates and studded leather [[Barding#Champron|chamfrons]]). Agricola is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the "River Taus" (usually assumed to be the [[River Tay]]) and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at [[Inchtuthil]].<ref>Although "Taus" is usually interpreted as referring to the Rivert Tay/[[Firth of Tay]], it has been suggested it was the [[Solway Firth]]. It cannot be the latter if Agricola was already campaigning much further north and Cerialis had previously reached the Gask Ridge.

==Mons Graupius==
[[File:Statue of Agricola at Bath.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Statue of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]]]]
In the summer of AD 84 the Romans faced the massed armies of the Caledonians at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]. Agricola, whose forces included a fleet, arrived at the site with [[light infantry]] bolstered with British [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]]. It is estimated that a total of 20,000 Romans faced 30,000 Caledonian [[warrior]]s.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#29|29]]. Wikisource.</ref><ref>Other estimates for the size of the Roman force based on Tacitus' account range from 17,000 to 30,000. See Hanson (2003) p. 203.</ref>

Agricola put his auxiliaries in the front line, keeping the legions in reserve, and relied on close-quarters fighting to make the Caledonians' unpointed slashing swords useless. Even though the Caledonians were put to rout and therefore lost this battle, two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Scottish Highlands or the "trackless wilds" as [[Tacitus]] called them. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be about 10,000 on the Caledonian side and roughly 360 on the Roman side. A number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the [[Grampian Mountains|Grampian]] [[Mounth]] within sight of the [[North Sea]]. In particular, Roy,<ref>Roy, William (1793) ''The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain''.</ref> Surenne, Watt, Hogan and others have advanced notions that the site of the battle may have been [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Megray Hill]] or other knolls near the [[Raedykes]] [[Castra|Roman camp]]. These points of high ground are proximate to the [[Elsick Mounth]], an ancient [[trackway]] used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres.<ref name=Hogan>Hogan, C.

===Calgacus===
The first resident of Scotland to appear in history by name was [[Calgacus]] ("the Swordsman"), a leader of the Caledonians at Mons Graupius, who is referred to by Tacitus in the ''Agricola'' (30) as "the most distinguished for birth and valour among the chieftains". Tacitus even invented a speech for him in advance of the battle in which he describes the Romans as:
{{cquote2|Robbers of the world, having by their universal plunder exhausted the land, they rifle the deep. If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if he be poor, they lust for dominion; neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them. Alone among men they covet with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; they make a solitude and call it peace.<ref>Tacitus. [http://members.aol.com/antoninus1/piety/agricola.htm Agricola (30)] Translated by [[Alfred John Church]] and William Jackson Brodribb. AOL.com. Retrieved 24 July 2008.</ref>}}

===Aftermath===

Calgacus' fate is unknown but, according to Tacitus, after the battle Agricola ordered the [[prefect]] of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm that Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the [[Orkney|Orcadians]]. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain.<ref>Tacitus claims that Orkney was "discovered and subdued", but Thomson (2008) pp. 4-5 is as sceptical about Tacitus's claims on behalf of Agricola as he is about Claudius's earlier subjugation of Orkney (see above).</ref> However, the Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] reports that this circumnavigation resulted in [[Titus]] receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79 AD. This is five years before Mons Graupius is believed by most historians to have taken place.<ref>Hoffmann, Birgitta (15 December 2001) [http://www.theromangaskproject.org.uk/Pages/Introduction/Tacitus.html "Archaeology versus Tacitus' Agricola: a 1st Century Worst Case Scenario"] The Roman Gask Project.

Marching camps may have been constructed along the southern shores of the [[Moray Firth]], although their existence is questioned.<ref name=Wolf/><ref>Moffat (2005) p. 232.</ref><ref>Hanson (2003) p. 198 - "none of the postulated sites discovered by aerial survey in Moray and Nairn over recent years has the distinctive morphological characteristics of a Roman fort".</ref> The total size of the Roman garrison in Scotland during the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] period of occupation is thought to be some 25,000 troops, requiring 16<U+2013>19,000 tons of grain per annum.<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 203-05.</ref> In addition, the material to construct the forts was substantial, estimated at 1 million [[cubic feet]] (28,315&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of timber during the first century. Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which may have had a garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30&nbsp;linear kilometres of wood for the walls alone, which would have used up 100&nbsp;hectares (247&nbsp;acres) of forest.<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 206.</ref><ref>Moffat (2005) p. 267.</ref><ref>Smout (2007) p. 32.</ref>

Soon after his announcement of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by [[Domitian]] and his post passed to [[Sallustius Lucullus]]. Agricola's successors were seemingly unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory.<ref name= Henig/> The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 245.</ref> By AD 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Solway Firth]].<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 195.</ref> [[Elginhaugh]] fort, in [[Midlothian]], dates to about this period as may [[Castle Greg]] in [[West Lothian]], which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby [[Pentland Hills|Pentlands]], from the [[River Forth|Forth]] to the [[Clyde Valley]].

Presumably as a consequence of the Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, which had been abandoned by the natives long ago, were re-occupied. Some new ones may even have been constructed in the north-east such as Hill O' Christ's Kirk in [[Aberdeenshire]].<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 266.</ref>

=="Towns" and southern brochs==
[[File:EdinsHallBroch.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Edin's Hall Broch]], showing intramural chambers]]
Ptolemy's map identifies 19 "towns" from intelligence gathered during the Agricolan campaigns. No archaeological evidence of any truly urban places has been found from this time and the names may have indicated hill forts or temporary market and meeting places. Most of the names are obscure: ''Devana'' may be the modern [[Banchory]], and ''Alauna'' (meaning "the rock") in the west is probably Dumbarton Rock and the place of the same name in the east of the Lowlands may be the site of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. ''Lindon'' may be [[Balloch]] on [[Loch Lomond]] side.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 268-70.</ref>

There are the remains of various broch towers in southern Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the [[Firth of Tay]], the far south-west and the eastern [[Scottish Borders|Borders]]. Their existence so far from the main centres of broch-building is something of a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come at the hands of the Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at [[Buchlyvie]] a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late first century AD and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including [[Red Deer]] and [[Boar|Wild Boar]].

[[Edin's Hall Broch]] in [[Berwickshire]] is the best preserved southern broch and although the ruins are superficially similar to some of the larger Orcadian broch villages it is unlikely that the tower was ever more than a single story high. There is an absence of Roman artefacts at this site. Various theories for the existence of these structures have been proposed, including their construction by northern invaders following the withdrawal of Roman troops after the Agricolan advance, or by allies of Rome encouraged to emulate the impressive northern style in order to suppress native resistance, perhaps even the Orcadian chiefs whose positive relationship with Rome may have continued from the beginnings of Romano-British relations. It is also possible that their construction had little to do with Roman frontier policy and was simply the importation of a new style by southern elites or it may have been a response by such elites to the growing threat of Rome prior to the invasion and an attempt to ally themselves, actually or symbolically, with the free north.<ref name=Arm>Armit (2003) pp. 119-32.</ref>

==Hadrian's Wall==
[[File:Hadrian's wall at Greenhead Lough.jpg|thumb|left|A section of [[Hadrian's Wall]] near Greenhead]]
[[Quintus Pompeius Falco]] became governor of Brittania between 118 and 122 and is thought to have suppressed an uprising involving the [[Brigantes]] of northern Britannia and the Selgovae. In his last year of office he hosted a visit to the [[Roman province|province]] by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] that resulted in the construction of [[Hadrian's Wall]] ([[Latin]]: ''Rigore Valli Aeli'', "the line along Hadrian's frontier").

This line of occupation of Britain was consolidated as one of the ''[[Limes|limites]]'' (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone and turf [[fortification]] built across the width of what is now modern-day northern [[England]]. The wall was 80 [[Roman mile]]s (73.5 statute miles or 117 kilometres) long,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/hadrian_gallery_01.shtml "Hadrian's Wall Gallery"] BBC. Retrieved 25 July 2008.</ref> its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the [[River Irthing]] the wall was made from squared stone and measured 3&nbsp;metres (9.7&nbsp;ft) wide and 5&ndash;6 metres (16&ndash;20&nbsp;ft) high, while west of the river the wall was made from turf and measured 6&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft) wide and 3.5&nbsp;metres (11.5&nbsp;ft) high. The wall was augmented by various ditches, [[berm]]s, and forts.

The wall had several purposes. Defence was the most obvious, but it also controlled movement behind the line, enabled the rapid transmission of military intelligence and facilitated the collection of customs dues. Its scale also demonstrated the power of Rome to her enemies, and was surely intended to enhance the prestige of its builder.<ref>Moffat (2005 p. 275.</ref> Hadrian's Wall remained the frontier between the Roman and Celtic worlds in Britain until 139.
[[File:Scotland.south.Ptolemy.map.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]

==Antonine Wall==
{{main|Antonine Wall}}
[[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]] was made governor of [[Roman Britain]] in 138, by the new Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]]. Urbicus was the son of a [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] landowner<ref>Freeman, Charles (1999) ''Egypt, Greece, and Rome.'' Oxford University Press. p. 508. ISBN 0-19-872194-3.</ref> and a native of [[Numidia]] (modern [[Algeria]]). Prior to coming to Britain he served during the [[Jewish Rebellion]] of 132&ndash;135, and then governing [[Germania Inferior]].

Antoninus Pius soon reversed the containment policy of his predecessor Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of [[Lowland Scotland]] by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at [[Coria (Corbridge)|Corbridge]] and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland c. 141, probably using [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']]. He evidently campaigned against several [[British tribes]] (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of [[Scotland]]; the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 203.</ref>

It seems likely that Urbicus planned his campaign of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland supply route for military personnel and equipment along [[Dere Street]], Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Damnonii.
[[File:Bar Hill.jpg|thumb|left|The course of the [[Antonine Wall]], at Barr Hill]]
Success was swift and the construction of a new ''limes'' between the Firth of Forth and the [[Firth of Clyde]] commenced. Contingents from at least one British legion are known to have assisted in the erection of the new turf barrier, as evidenced by an inscription from the fort at [[Old Kilpatrick]], the [[Antonine Wall]]'s western terminus. Today, the [[wikt:sward|sward]]-covered wall is the remains of a defensive line made of [[Sod|turf]] circa 7&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft) high, with nineteen forts. It was constructed after AD 139 and extended for {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It was possibly after the defences were finished that Urbicus turned his attention upon the fourth lowland Scottish tribe, the Novantae who inhabited the Dumfries and Galloway peninsula. The main lowland tribes, sandwiched as they were between Hadrian's Wall of stone to the south and the new turf wall to the north, later formed a confederation against Roman rule, collectively known as the [[Maeatae]].

The Antonine Wall had a variety of purposes. It provided a defensive line against the Caledonians. It cut off the Maeatae from their Caledonian allies and created a buffer zone north of Hadrian's Wall. It also facilitated troop movements between east and west, but its main purpose may not have been primarily military. It enabled Rome to control and tax trade and may have prevented potentially disloyal new subjects of Roman rule from communicating with their independent brethren to the north and coordinating revolts.<ref>Breeze pp. 144-159.</ref><ref>According to Robertson (1960) p. 39 many of the Antonine forts had strong defences to the south and other Roman forts in southern Scotland actually faced south.</ref> Urbicus achieved an impressive series of military successes, but like Agricola's they were short-lived.

The destruction of some of the southern brochs may date to the Antonine advance, the hypothesis being that whether or not they had previously been symbols of Roman patronage they had now outlived their usefulness from a Roman point of view.<ref name=Arm/>

==Later Roman campaigns==
The Roman frontier became Hadrian's Wall again, although Roman incursions into Scotland continued. Initially outpost forts were occupied in the south-west and Trimontium remained in use but they too were abandoned after the mid 180s.<ref>Hanson (2003) pp. 197-8.</ref>

Roman troops, however, penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, there is a greater density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after AD 197.<ref>Robertson (1960) p. 37.</ref> The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor [[Septimus Severus]], claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.<ref>W.S. Hanson (2002)  [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_109/109_140_150.pdf "Roman campaigns north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus: the evidence of the temporary camps"] (pdf) ads.ahds.ac.uk.

According to [[Dio Cassius]], he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics, although it is likely that these figures are a significant exaggeration.<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 203 suggests the total Roman force was 40-50,000 and according to Breeze (2006) p. 42 the total Roman garrison of Britain at the time of the construction of the Antonine Wall included three legions and numbered about 48,700 troops.</ref>

A string of forts was constructed in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as [[Normandykes]], [[Ythan Wells]], [[Deers Den]] and [[Glenmailen]].<ref name=Hogan/> However, only two forts in Scotland, at [[Cramond]] and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely known to have been permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213.<ref name=H198>Hanson (2003) p. 198.</ref> There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.<ref>Miket, Roger "The souterrains of Skye" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 82.</ref>

By 210, Severus' campaigning had made significant gains, but his campaign was cut short when he fell fatally ill, dying at [[Eboracum]] in 211. Although his son [[Caracalla]] continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.<ref name=H198/><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History''. Book 77. Sections 11<U+2013>15.</ref>

It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made. When Septimus Severus' wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of Caledonian chief Argentocoxos replied: "We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest".<ref>Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html "Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII"]. University of Chicago. Retrieved 24 July 2008</ref>

Little is known about this alliance of Iron Age tribes, which may have been augmented by fugitives from Roman rule further south. The exact location of "Caledonia" is unknown, and the boundaries are unlikely to have been fixed.<ref>''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'' (1911) states that "a tribe of Caledones" are "named by the geographer Ptolemy as living within boundaries which are now unascertainable".</ref> The name itself is a Roman one, as used by Tacitus, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]],<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 21-22.</ref> but the name by which the Caledonians referred to themselves is unknown. It is likely that the prior to the Roman invasions, political control in the region was highly decentralised and no evidence has emerged of any specific Caledonian military or political leadership.<ref name=Woolis>Wooliscroft, D. W. [http://www.theromangaskproject.org.uk/Pages/Introduction/Why_failure.html "More Thoughts On Why the Romans Failed To Conquer Scotland"] The Roman Gask Project. Retrieved 7 February 2009. Wooliscroft notes that Calgacus "is never referred to by any term, such as king or general".</ref>

Later excursions by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] utilises a third or fourth century Roman map and identifies four ''loci'' (meeting places, possibly markets) in southern Scotland. ''Locus Maponi'' is possibly the modern Lochmabenstane near [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]] which continued to be used as a muster point well into the historic period. Two of the others indicate meeting places of the Damnonii and Selgovae, and the fourth, ''Manavi'' may be [[Clackmannan]].<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 284. ''Loci'' implied supervised meeting places rather than potentially hostile ones, but it is scarcely credible that military interventions of this nature were a regular occurrence at this time.</ref> From the time of Caracalla onwards, no further attempts were made to permanently occupy territory in Scotland.<ref name=H198/>

==The Painted Ones==
{{main|Picts}}
[[File:Pictish stone strathpeffer eagle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Clach an Tiompain]], a Pictish symbol stone in [[Strathpeffer]]]]
The intermittent Roman presence in Scotland coincided with the emergence of the [[Picts]], a [[confederation]] of tribes who lived to the north of the Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century. They are often assumed to have been the descendants of the Caledonii though the evidence for this connection is circumstantial and the name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown.<ref>The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''<U+03A0><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03AF>'' ([[Latin]] ''Picti'') first appears in a [[panegyric]] written by [[Eumenius]] in 297 and is taken to mean "painted or [[tattoo]]ed people".</ref><ref>The nature of the relationship between the Picts and the Caledonians is obscure. There are 3rd and 4th century Roman references to "''Picti'' and ''Caledonii''" and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] states that the Picts consisted of the tribes of the ''Dicalydonae'' and the ''Verturiones''. The idea that the Picts were heirs to the Caledonians would appear to be a convenient simplification of a complex flux of relationships. See for example Moffat (2005) p. 297 or [http://www.siliconglen.com/Scotland/11_5.html "The Picts"] (Siliconglen.com. Retrieved 8 February 2009) for a more informal overview.</ref> They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their [[Pictish stones|monumental stones]].<ref>For art in general see for example Foster (2004) pp. 26<U+2013>28.</ref> The [[Gaels]] of Dalriada called the Picts ''[[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]]'',<ref>The ''Cruithni'' are discussed by Byrne (1973) pp. 106<U+2013>109.</ref><ref>The [[Brython|Britons]] in the south knew the Picts as ''Prydyn''. Old Irish ''cruth'' and Welsh ''pryd'' are the [[Q-Celtic|Q-]] and [[P-Celtic]] forms respectively of a word meaning "form" or "shape". See [http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb11.html MacBain's Dictionary]. Retrieved 26 December 2008.</ref> and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.<ref>Forsyth, Katherine (2000) pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref>

The means by which the Pictish confederation formed is also unknown, although there is speculation that reaction to the growth of the Roman Empire was a factor.<ref>See the discussion of the creation of the Frankish Confederacy in Geary (1988) chapter 2.</ref> The early history of Pictland is unclear. In later periods multiple kings existed, ruling over separate kingdoms, with one king, sometimes two, more or less dominating their lesser neighbours.<ref name="Broun 2005">Broun (2005).</ref> ''[[De Situ Albanie]]'', the [[Pictish Chronicle]], and the ''[[Duan Albanach]]'', along with Irish legends, have been used to argue the existence of seven Pictish kingdoms although more may have existed and some evidence suggests that a Pictish kingdom also existed in Orkney.<ref name="Broun 2005"/><ref>[[Adomn<U+00E1>n of Iona|Adomn<U+00E1>n]] (tr. & ed.

[[File:Loch Tay Crannog.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed [[crannog]] on [[Loch Tay]]]]

The Pictish relationship with Rome appears to have been less overtly hostile than their Caledonii predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties from both sides of the frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Brittania.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 284, 299.</ref> Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.<ref name=Woolis/>

The technology of everyday life is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been similar to that in Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of [[watermill]]s in Pictland and [[kiln]]s were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate.<ref>Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref> Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and [[crannogs]] remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.<ref>Armit (2003) pp 135-7.</ref><ref>Crone, B.A. (1993) "Crannogs and Chronologies". PSAS '''123''' pp. 245<U+2013>254.</ref><ref>Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 52<U+2013>61.</ref><ref>Ralston, Ian B. M. and Armit, Ian "The early Historic Period: An Archaeological Perspective" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) p. 226.</ref>

Elsewhere in Scotland [[wheelhouse (archaeology)|wheelhouses]] were constructed, probably for ritualistic purposes, in the west and north. Their geographical locations are highly restricted, which suggests that they may have been contained within a political or cultural frontier of some kind and the co-incidence of their arrival and departure being associated with the period of Roman influence in Scotland is a matter of ongoing debate. It is not known whether the culture that constructed them was "Pictish" as such although they would certainly have been known to the Picts.<ref>Crawford, Iain "The wheelhouse" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 127-28.</ref>

As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided south of Hadrian's Wall in earnest in 342, 360 and 365 and they participated in the [[Great Conspiracy|''conspiratio barbarica '']] of 367. Rome fought back, mounting campaigns in 369 and 384, but these were short-lived successes. The legions finally deserted ''Brittania'' in 410, never to return.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 297-301.</ref>

==Roman legacy==
The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control.<ref name=H198/>

Scotland has inherited two main features from the Roman period, although mostly indirectly: the use of the [[Latin script]] for its languages, and the emergence of [[Christianity]] as the predominant religion. Through Christianity, the [[Latin language]] would become used by the natives of Scotland for the purposes of church and government for centuries more.

Roman influence assisted the spread of Christianity throughout [[Europe]], but there is little evidence of a direct link between the Roman Empire and Christian missions north of Hadrian's Wall. Traditionally, [[Saint Ninian|Ninian]] is credited as the first [[bishop]] active in Scotland. He is briefly mentioned by [[Bede]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|page=19|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}</ref> who states that around 397 he set up his base at [[Whithorn]] in the south-west of Scotland, building a stone church there, known as [[Candida Casa]]. More recently it has been suggested that Ninian was the 6th century missionary [[Finnian of Moville]],<ref>Clancy, Thomas O. (2001) "The real St Ninian." ''The Innes Review'' '''52''' pp. 1-28.</ref><ref>Fraser, James E. "Northumbrian Whithorn and the Making of St Ninian." (2002) ''The Innes Review'', '''53''' pp. 40<U+2013>59</ref> but either way Roman influence on early Christianity in Scotland does not seem to have been significant.

Although little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of military occupation,<ref>Hanson (2003) 195.</ref> Imperial Rome was ruthless and brutal in pursuit of its ends.<ref>For example, it is clear that an Iron Age village at Cardean in [[Angus]] was simply removed wholesale in order to construct a Roman Camp. See Moffat (2005) p. 254.</ref> Genocide was a familiar part of its foreign policy and it is clear that the invasions and occupations cost thousands of lives. Alistair Moffat writes:
{{cquote2|The reality is that the Romans came to what is now Scotland, they saw, they burned, killed, stole and occasionally conquered, and then they left a tremendous mess behind them, clearing away native settlements and covering good farmland with the remains of ditches, banks, roads, and other sorts of ancient military debris. Like most imperialists they arrived to make money, to gain political advantage and to exploit the resources of their colonies at virtually any price to the conquered. And remarkably, in Britain, in Scotland, we continue to admire them for it.<ref name="Moffat 2005 p. 226">Moffat (2005) p. 226.</ref>}}

All the more surprising given that the [[Vindolanda tablets]]<ref>Hogan, C. Michael, (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17742 "Vindolanda Roman Fort"] in ''The Megalithic Portal'', ed. A. Burnham. Retrieved 24 July 2008.</ref> show that the Roman nickname for the north British locals was ''Brittunculi'' meaning "nasty little Britons".<ref name="Moffat 2005 p. 226"/>

Similarly, William Hanson concludes that:
{{cquote2|For many years it has been almost axiomatic in studies of the period that the Roman conquest must have had some major medium or long-term impact on Scotland. On present evidence that cannot be substantiated either in terms of environment, economy, or, indeed, society. The impact appears to have been very limited. The general picture remains one of broad continuity, not of disruption.... The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development."<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 216.</ref>}}

The Romans' part in the clearances of the once extensive Caledonian forest remains a matter of debate.<ref>Hanson (2003) pp. 208-10.</ref> That these forests were once considerably more extensive than they are now is not in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th century writer [[Hector Boece]] believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into [[Atholl]] and [[Lochaber]] and was inhabited by white bulls with "crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis".<ref>Smout (2007) p.20.</ref> Later historians such as [[P. F. Tytler]] and [[W. F. Skene]] followed suit as did the 20th century naturalist [[Frank Fraser Darling]]. Modern techniques, including [[palynology]] and [[dendrochronology]] suggest a more complex picture. Changing post-glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 BC and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway by the time the legions arrived.<ref>Smout (2007) pp.20-32.</ref> Extensive analyses of Black Loch in [[Fife]] suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 BC until the first century AD Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population.<ref>Smout (2007) p. 34.</ref> The situation outwith the Roman-held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial.
[[File:Yr.Hen.Ogledd.550.650.Koch.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
The archaeological legacy of Rome in Scotland is of interest, but sparse, especially in the north. Almost all the sites are essentially military in nature and include about {{convert|650|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads.<ref>Hanson (2003) p. 202.</ref><ref>Moffat (2005) p. 249.</ref> Overall, it is hard to detect any direct connections between native architecture and settlement patterns and Roman influence.<ref>Ralston, Ian B. M. and Armit, Ian "The early Historic Period: An Archaeological Perspective" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) p. 218.</ref> Elsewhere in Europe, new kingdoms and languages emerged from the remnants of the once-mighty Roman world. In Scotland, the Celtic Iron Age way of life, often troubled, but never extinguished by Rome, simply re-asserted itself. In the north the Picts continued to be the main power prior to the arrival and subsequent domination of the Scots of [[Dalriada]]. The [[Damnonii]] eventually formed the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] based at [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton Rock]]. South of the Forth, the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speaking [[Brython]]ic kingdoms of ''[[Hen Ogledd|Yr Hen Ogledd]]'' (English: "The Old North") flourished during the 5th&ndash;7th centuries.

The most enduring Roman legacy may be that created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created a distinction between the northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political debate. This is probably coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence played an important role in the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|early Medieval period]] after the fall of Rome.<ref>Koch (2006) p. 903 notes that ''yr Hen Ogledd'' refers to the Welsh-speaking parts of northern Britain north and south of Hadrian's Wall and that these areas were "as integral to the Welsh tradition as Wales itself".</ref>

==In fiction==
The [[Legio IX Hispana|9th Spanish Legion]] participated in the Roman invasion of Britain, suffering losses under Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the rebellion of [[Boudica]] of 61, and setting up a fortress in 71 that later became part of [[Eburacum]]. Although some authors have claimed that the 9th Legion disappeared in 117,<ref>For example, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill, Winston]] (1956) ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'' vol.1.</ref> there are extant records for it later than that year, and it was probably annihilated in the east of the Roman Empire.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/ix_hispana.html "Legio VIIII Hispana"] Livius.org. Retrieved 26 July 2008.</ref> For a time it was believed, at least by some British historians, that the legion vanished during its conflicts in present-day Scotland. This idea was used in the novels ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' by Rosemary Sutcliff, ''Legion From the Shadows'' by [[Karl Edward Wagner]], ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]'' by [[Alan Garner]], ''Engine City'' by [[Ken MacLeod]], ''Warriors of Alavna'' by N. M. Browne, and in the feature films ''[[The Last Legion]]'' and ''[[The Eagle (2011 film)|The Eagle]]''.
