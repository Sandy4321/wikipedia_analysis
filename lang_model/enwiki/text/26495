'''Bhuma Devi''' or '''Bhumi Devi''' or '''Bhu Devi''' is the divine wife of [[Varaha|Lord Varaha]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Lord Vishnu]]. According to [[Hindu]] mythology, the divine saint [[Andal]] is a form of her. The demon [[Narakasura]] whose killing by [[Krishna]] is celebrated as the festival of [[Diwali]] is her son.<ref>{{cite web

|title = killing of Narakasura}}</ref>. She is the mother of [[Sita]], (note the symbolism of the baby Sita being found in a ploughed field). According to the uttara-kanda, when Sita finally leaves her husband [[Rama]], she returns to Bhumi. Bhumi Devi is also believed to be one of the two forms of [[Lakshmi]]. The other is Sridevi, who remains with [[Narayana]]. Bhudevi is the Goddess of Earth, and the fertility form of Lakshmi.

It is interesting to note that several female deities have had births similar to Sita.  Alamelu Thayar of Tiruchanur had a similar beginning, being found in a ploughed field by Akasa Raja.  Goda (Andal) was found under a Tulasi plant by Perialvar.
