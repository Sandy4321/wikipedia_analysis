'''Leonte R<U+0103>utu''' (until 1945 '''Lev Nikolayevich (Nicolaievici) Oigenstein'''; February 28, 1910 <U+2013> 1993) was a [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Romania]]n communist activist and propagandist. He was chief ideologist of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] ("Workers' Party") during the rule of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], and one of the few high-ranking communists to have studied [[Marxism]] from the source. His adventurous youth, with two prison terms served for illegal political activity, culminated in his self-exile to the [[Soviet Union]], where he spent the larger part of [[World War II]]. Specializing in [[agitprop]] and becoming friends with communist militant [[Ana Pauker]], R<U+0103>utu made his way back to Romania during the [[communization]] process of the late 1940s, and became a feared potentate of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]]. As head of the Communist Party's new Agitprop Section, he devised some of the most controversial cultural policies, and managed to survive Pauker's downfall in 1952.

As Gheorghiu-Dej's assistant, R<U+0103>utu played a leading part in all the successive avatars of Romanian communism: he was a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and [[Zhdanov Doctrine|Zhdanovist]] before 1955, an [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionist]] until 1958, and a [[National communism|national communist]] since. During this long transition, he instigated (and gave a Marxist backing to) the successive campaigns against Gheorghiu-Dej's political adversaries, selectively purged academia of suspected anti-communists, and deposed some of his own supporters. He became widely hated for his perceived lack of scruples, depicted by disgraced communist writers as "the perfect acrobat" or "[[Malvolio]]".

R<U+0103>utu preserved some of his influence after his national communist friend [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] took overt the party leadership. He lost his Agitprop prerogatives, but became instead rector of the party' own [[<U+015E>tefan Gheorghiu Academy]], and still played a part in defining the official dogmas. He was eventually deposed in 1981, as punishment for his daughter's decision to emigrate. He spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity, witnessing the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of communism in 1989]].

==Biography==
===Early activities===
R<U+0103>tu's birthplace was [[B<U+0103>l<U+0163>i]] (''Byeltsi''), a city in the [[Bessarabia Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]], where his father Nikolai Ivanovich Oigenstein (or ''Nicolai Ivanovici Oighenstein'') worked as a pharmacist. The Oigensteins were Russian-educated [[Bessarabian Jews|Jewish]], and did not speak [[Romanian language|Romanian]] until ca. 1920.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.61-62</ref> Some communist sources suggest that R<U+0103>utu was born in Romania-proper, at [[F<U+0103>lticeni]], but this account is either misled or misleading.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.61</ref> Lev Nikolayevich (later ''Leonte'' or ''Leonea'') was the eldest of three brothers; Dan (later Dan R<U+0103>utu) was the second-born; the third brother, Mikhail, would later take the name of Mihail "Mi<U+015F>a" Oi<U+015F>teanu.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.62-63, 123-124</ref>

Lev witnessed the birth of [[Greater Romania]] from B<U+0103>l<U+0163>i, where he remained until his high school graduation. He later relocated to [[Bukovina]] region, and, in 1928, was signaled in [[Bucharest]], the national capital.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.22, 23</ref> The future ideologist entered the [[University of Bucharest]] to study mathematics, but never graduated.<ref name="crime">{{ro icon}} [http://www.crimelecomunismului.ro/ro/biografiile_nomenklaturii/ Biografiile nomenklaturii], at the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile site; accessed 12 May 2012</ref><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.23, 63</ref> (He may also have spent a while at the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Bucharest Medical School]].)<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.63</ref> He entered the [[Union of Communist Youth|Communist Youth]] in 1929 and the party itself in 1931,<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18, 39, 444</ref> contributing to its propaganda activities. In the years when the Romanian Communist Party (PCR, later "Workers' Party", or PMR) was banned, he was editor of the party organ ''[[Sc<U+00EE>nteia]]'' and worked with [[<U+015E>tefan Fori<U+015F>]], [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]], [[Valter Roman]], [[Sorin Toma]], Mircea B<U+0103>l<U+0103>nescu and Tatiana Leapis (later Bulan). Leapis was R<U+0103>utu's first wife, but left him for Fori<U+015F>.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.63-64</ref>

Characterized as intelligent, ironic and well-informed, R<U+0103>utu preferred to read [[Russian literature|Russian and Soviet literature]]. Although lacking a thorough training in philosophy, he was one of the few PCR activists with a certain knowledge of Marxist and even non-Marxist theory,<ref name="crime"/> but despised most forms of [[continental philosophy]] and [[modernism]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18-20, 22, 23, 33, 57-58, 82-86</ref> Political scientist [[Vladimir Tism<U+0103>neanu]] describes R<U+0103>utu as comparable with some other Eastern European dogmatic [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], from [[Jakub Berman]] and [[J<U+00F3>zsef R<U+00E9>vai]] to [[Kurt Hager]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.15, 21, 73, 131-132</ref> In this definition, R<U+0103>utu was a "self-hating intellectual".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.58</ref> Tism<U+0103>neanu also suggests that R<U+0103>utu separated from his Jewish roots very early in life, growing up into [[Russian culture]], condemning all expression of [[Jewish nationalism]], and becoming classifiable as a "[[Jewish atheism|non-Jewish Jew]]".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18, 51, 68-69, 76, 82-86</ref> Likewise, historian Lucian Nastas<U+0103> describes R<U+0103>utu as one of the Romanian communists who were "less dominated by the obsession of ethnic affiliation (the religious one being entirely excluded by the aggressive atheism promoted in the Soviet Union)"; R<U+0103>utu and others were instead animated by their "obedience to the Soviet Union."<ref>Nastas<U+0103>, p.18-19</ref>

R<U+0103>utu was first tried for sedition while still in the Communist Youth, and sentenced to a one-year prison term by the authorities of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. He was for a while held in [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]] jail, then moved to [[Doftana prison]], in the company of other PCR militants, becoming acquainted with many of Romania's future political bosses.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.24, 39, 65, 71, 97</ref> Just shortly after being released, in 1932, he was again on trial: until 1934, he was again in prison, first at the penitentiary facility of [[Cern<U+0103>u<U+0163>i]] and then at [[Jilava prison]].<ref name="tis39">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.39</ref> Upon release, he became an activist for the communist committee in Bucharest.<ref name="tis39"/> After his breakup with Tatiana Leapis, the young activist met his future wife Natalia "Niunia" Redel, herself Jewish and Russian-educated.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.62, 63-64</ref>

Answering a call for repatriation,<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.24, 65</ref> R<U+0103>utu and Natalia emigrated to the [[Soviet Union]] following the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|1940 occupation of Bessarabia]]. Before leaving, he entrusted his documents to Fori<U+015F>' lover and secretary, Victoria S<U+00E2>rbu.<ref name="tis65">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.65</ref> Although Jewish, he was not dissuaded by the interval of [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi<U+2013>Soviet cooperation]]: once relocated to the [[Moldavian SSR]], he was made co-editor of ''P<U+0103>m<U+00EE>nt Sovietic'' ("Soviet Land"), a propaganda magazine.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.24, 39, 65</ref> He may have also been an ideological instructor for the [[Communist Party of Moldova|Bessarabian Communist Party]].<ref name="tis65"/> 

Lev and Natalia were married in the Soviet Union.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.64</ref> Little is known about the couple in the months that followed the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi and Romanian attack on the Soviet Union]]. They escaped Bessarabia, and fled further inland: R<U+0103>utu is said to have been a mere laborer at a sand quarry and a ''[[kolkhoz]]''.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.66</ref> He and Natalia had two children, both of whom died, probably of hunger, during the months of Soviet retreat.<ref name="tis69">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.69</ref> At some point (perhaps in 1943), R<U+0103>utu became head of the [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] Romanian-language division, making him a favorite of exile faction leader [[Ana Pauker]]'s, together with Valter Roman and [[Petre Boril<U+0103>]].<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.25, 29-30, 32, 39, 65-72, 445</ref> This assignment placed R<U+0103>utu in direct contact with some of Pauker's colleagues in the [[Comintern]]: he replaced [[Basil Spiru]], of [[University of Leipzig|Marx University]] fame, and was supervised by [[Rudolf Sl<U+00E1>nsk<U+00FD>]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.25, 66-67</ref> His other job was as book editor for the [[Foreign Languages Publishing House]].<ref name="tis39"/>

===Communist rise===
R<U+0103>utu returned to Romania in 1945 at Pauker's request and was immediately catapulted to the top of the party's propaganda section, as [[Iosif Chi<U+015F>inevschi]]'s deputy, forming part of his editorial team at the revived ''Sc<U+00EE>nteia''.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.32, 39, 40</ref> His ''Sc<U+00EE>nteia'' articles were noted for their bitter irony and for the vehemence of the insults they addressed to political enemies, in particular the [[National Peasants' Party]] and its organ ''[[Dreptatea]]''. He was among the fiercest critics of multiparty, pluralist democracy, together with [[Silviu Brucan]], [[<U+015E>tefan Voicu]], Sorin Toma, [[Nestor Ignat]], [[Nicolae Moraru]], [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]] and [[Traian <U+015E>elmaru]]. R<U+0103>utu later recruited the core of the PMR's ideologists from his group.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.30, 72-76, 86-88, 92-93, 96-97, 111, 143-144</ref>

In his other important capacity, R<U+0103>utu helped set up and guide the PCR's [[Agitprop]], or "Political Education", Section. It came into existence just months before the Kingdom was replaced with a [[Communist Romania|communist state]], officially at the request of communist controlled trade unions, and was led by R<U+0103>utu from 1948 to 1965. The Agitprop Section embodied the PMR's control over the [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Education]] and [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Culture]] ministries, the [[Romanian Academy]], the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Broadcasting Committee]] and [[Cinema of Romania|cinema studios]], the [[AGERPRES]] agency, the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Union]] and the [[Artists' Union of Romania|Artists' Union]], and even [[Sport in Romania|sporting associations and clubs]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.43-45</ref> Already in 1947, R<U+0103>utu organized Agitprop's unified offensive against the nearly dissolved "[[reactionary]]" forces: the National Peasants' Party, framed during the [[T<U+0103>m<U+0103>d<U+0103>u Affair]]; the [[National Liberal Party-T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu]], that Ana Pauker had pushed out of the coalition government; and the dissident [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (defunct)|Social Democrats]], who had refused to be absorbed into the Communist-led "Workers' Party".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.166-167, 170-173, 177</ref> His orders were for communist propaganda to focus on condemning the [[Western Allies]] and the [[Marshall Plan]] (''see [[Vin americanii!]]''), and on supporting the supposed growth in industrial production from homegrown socialist sources.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.167, 171, 173-177</ref>  

The other Oigensteins and the Redels also moved to Romania.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.62-63, 70, 123-124</ref> The Romanian-sounding surname of ''R<U+0103>utu'', picked out after a [[Romanianization]] policy was imposed by the PCR doctrinaires, may have been borrowed from the novels of Lev's one favorite Romanian author, [[Constantin Stere]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.71, 76</ref> Lev and Natalia had two daughters: Anca, born 1947, and Elena ("Lena"), born 1951.<ref name="tis69"/> The family was integrated into the [[nomenklatura]], and lived in villas located near the political epicenter that was [[Prim<U+0103>verii]] compound: Londra Street, then Turgheniev Street.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.70, 92-93</ref>

Formally acknowledged as Chi<U+015F>inevschi's closest collaborator, a member of the central committee from 1948, and head of the Agitprop from 1956, Leonte R<U+0103>utu is widely regarded as the dictator of Romanian cultural life until the death of party leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]].<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.27-34, 38-39, 44-45, 109-111, 115, 445</ref> His credentials came from the communist essay ''<U+00CE>mpotriva cosmopolitismului <U+015F>i obiectivismului burghez <U+00EE>n <U+015F>tiin<U+0163>ele sociale'' ("Against [[Rootless cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitanism]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Bourgeois Objectivism]] in Social Science"), published by the party press and ''Lupta de Clas<U+0103>'' journal in 1949. This work introduced Romanians to [[historical materialism]] and a ''[[partiinost']]'' analysis of cultural or scientific matters, borrowing Soviet criticism of "[[bourgeois pseudoscience]]": against [[genetics]], [[neo-Malthusianism]], [[Indeterminism]], and in large part against "cosmopolitan" social thinkers ([[Ernest Bevin]], [[L<U+00E9>on Blum]], [[Harold Laski]]).<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.216-224, 230</ref> The two centuries of [[Romanian philosophy]], from the advocates of [[Westernization]] ([[Titu Maiorescu]]) to the radical [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]] ([[Nae Ionescu]]), were dismissed as irrelevant to the real priorities of Romanian workers,<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.236-245</ref> with R<U+0103>utu firmly rooting Romania's past in [[Slavic Europe]].<ref>Ciocan, p.304</ref> Likewise, the right-wing historian [[Gheorghe I. Br<U+0103>tianu]] was depicted as both a "[[Nazism|Hitlerite]]" and a puppet of "[[American imperialism]]".<ref>Ciocan, p.304; Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.241</ref> R<U+0103>utu's text is regarded by Tism<U+0103>neanu as an "embarrassing" contribution to the field,<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.26, 30-31</ref> and described by historian Leonard Ciocan as the origin of "[[Manichaeism|manichean]]" methodology and "typically Stalinist" discourse in Romanian social science.<ref>Ciocan, p.303-304</ref> 

His inspiration for such texts was Soviet culture boss [[Andrei Zhdanov]], whose [[Zhdanov Doctrine|anti-formalist and anti-individualist campaigns]] he would try to replicate in Sovietized Romania.<ref>Ple<U+015F>a, p.168; Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.20-21, 30-31, 33, 38-39, 41, 69, 113, 126-127, 179, 226-232, 444</ref> Since 1948, he had been preoccupied with eradicating "decadent" literature and art, including urban-themed modernism, but also informed his subordinates not to allow a resurgence of ruralizing traditionalism.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.178-179</ref> He declared Zhdanov's "bitter criticism" of composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] to be a "profound" positive example: "Take the gloves off, let's start criticizing [as well]. Here too we can learn from the Soviets."<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.179</ref> Also then, he ordered a selection of publishing houses and literary magazines that followed a "just line", and set aside funds for financing writers who had internalized the Workers' Party principles and "stepped down from the ivory tower".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.180-182</ref>

A notorious experiment approved by R<U+0103>utu, and brought to life by Sorin Toma, was the campaign against celebrated poet [[Tudor Arghezi]], attacked as a "decadent" and subsequently banned for a number of years.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.26, 41-42, 101-102</ref> Looking back on the events in 1949, the Agitprop chief told his subordinates: "[Writers] who are still enemies must be stomped upon without mercy. Arghezi, who has not changed, not even today, I have fulminated."<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.42</ref> Other targets were literary critics [[<U+015E>erban Cioculescu]] and [[Vladimir Streinu]], both depicted as ill-adapted to the spirit of [[socialist patriotism]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.30, 117, 243, 319</ref> In 1949, when R<U+0103>utu began his purge of academia, one of the first to fall was literary historian [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], a Professor at the University of Bucharest, who, although left-wing, was not considered a true communist.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.45, 252-253</ref> As such figures were sidelined, R<U+0103>utu himself was given the Chair of [[Marxism-Leninism]] at Bucharest University, which he kept from March 1949 to May 1952.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.45, 123</ref>

===Pauker's fall and "processing" campaign===
[[File:<U+00CE>n loc de un plan cincinal, cinci planuri anuale.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Josip Broz Tito]] as a villain plotting the invasion of Romania ([[East Germany|East German]] cartoon, presented to Gheorghiu-Dej on his 50th birthday, 1951)]]
Navigating his course between the warring PMR groups of Pauker and Gheorghiu-Dej, R<U+0103>utu established his reputation during the fall of a third faction, [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]]'s "Secretariat" group. Already in ''<U+00CE>mpotriva cosmopolitismului...'', R<U+0103>utu called his rival an "[[Enemy of the people|enemy of the working class]]", and a defamer of Marxist values.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.239-240</ref> As noted by Tism<U+0103>neanu, he applied "his proverbial zeal" to condemning P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu's entire political activity.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.26</ref> With the [[Tito<U+2013>Stalin split]], R<U+0103>utu also became involved in exposing supposed "[[Titoism|Titoist]]" infiltrations in Romania, ordering a tight monitoring of [[Tanjug]] propaganda and an Agitprop project specifically directed against [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.261-265</ref> In parallel, he took over supervision of the nominally independent left-wing daily ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul]]'', overseeing its liquidation in 1951.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[G. Br<U+0103>tescu]], [http://js.mesagerul.ro/2009/12/11/uniunea-ziaristilor-profesionisti-1919-2009 "Uniunea Ziari<U+015F>tilor Profesioni<U+015F>ti, 1919 - 2009. Compendiu aniversar"], in ''Mesagerul de Bistri<U+0163>a-N<U+0103>s<U+0103>ud'', December 11, 2009</ref>

R<U+0103>utu first impressed critics of the regime by being able to survive Pauker's downfall (1952), and was one of the very few of the wartime exiles not to be designated a "[[Right Opposition|Right deviationist]]".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.16, 32-33, 70</ref> Together with [[Miron Constantinescu]], the other PMR intellectual, he initiated the campaign to purge all other supposed inner-party oppositionists, drafting the PMR resolution on ''prelucr<U+0103>ri'' ("processing", a euphemism for "interrogations").<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.32</ref> In his speeches to the PMR sections, R<U+0103>utu described the cadre verification policy as inspired by the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th CPSU Congress]] and its talk of "ideological work" being paramount in the consolidation of socialism.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.267-270</ref> He declared Pauker a saboteur of [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization]], and her associate [[Vasile Luca]] guilty of "criminal activity".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.275-276, 281</ref>

In large part, "processing" meant a clampdown on writers with supposed (and supposedly concealed) "[[Fascism|fascist]]" sympathies. A communist-turned-dissident poet, [[Nina Cassian]], recalls: "Leonte R<U+0103>utu [...] dominated these scatty, vulnerable, terrified and confused beings<U+2014>the artists and the writers, producing tragedies and comedies, stagings glories and stigmatization, paralyzing one's morality, activating another's immorality".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.49</ref> Cassian was targeted as a critic of the regime, and kept under surveillance for her "negative influence" on other literary figures, including her lover of the time, [[Marin Preda]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.316-318</ref> One author to escape from R<U+0103>utu's campaigns was modernist left-winger [[Geo Dumitrescu]], whom poet [[Eugen Jebeleanu]] defended, at the last moment, from claims that he had been working for [[far-right]] newspapers during the war years.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.116</ref> Senior writers George C<U+0103>linescu and [[Victor Eftimiu]] were accused of concealing Social Democratic sympathies.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.318-319</ref>

Meanwhile, historian [[Constantin Daicoviciu]], a former member of the [[Iron Guard]] fascist movement, was found to be an embarrassment for the communist-run peace committees, and banned from politics.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.281</ref> Paradoxically, other areas under R<U+0103>utu's control escaped such purges, and former far-right affiliates such as [[Octav Onicescu]] and [[Ion Barbu]] pursued their scientific careers with little standing in their way.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.117</ref>

R<U+0103>utu built himself a new power base comprising noted Agitprop figures, some of whom were also writers and journalists. The prominent ones were Moraru, <U+015E>elmaru, [[Savin Bratu]], [[Ovid Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu]], [[Paul Georgescu]], [[Nicolae Tertulian]] and [[Ion Vitner]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.20, 25-26, 111, 142-146</ref> Over the years, his deputies included [[Mihail Roller]] (who had also returned from the Soviet Union), [[Ofelia Manole]], [[Paul Niculescu-Mizil]], [[Nicolae Goldberger]] (a member of the [[politburo]] since the 1930s), [[Manea M<U+0103>nescu]] (in charge of science), [[Cornel Onescu]] and [[Pavel <U+0162>ugui]] (later expelled from the party for having concealed his youthful sympathy for the Iron Guard).<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.45, 76-81, 92-95, 103-108, 323-327</ref> Some of his other favorites, including [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]] (recovered from an initial put-down for his "cosmopolitan" discourse) and [[Ern<U+0151> G<U+00E1>ll]], became the official interpreters of [[Marxist philosophy]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.19, 110-112, 150-151, 248-250</ref>

Before and after 1952, R<U+0103>utu's program was rigidly and thoroughly Stalinist. As such, Tism<U+0103>neanu writes, he spearheaded the most damaging campaigns in the cultural field, "designed to terrorize Romania's intellectual class": "the destruction of Romanian Academy research institutes, the [Academy's own] mutilation, the forced Sovietization, [...] the gaudy kowtowing at Russian culture (as it had been defined under the Stalinist canon) [...]; the promotion of fanatics, of the ideologically possessed, impostors and dilettantes, to high cultural offices".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.16-17</ref> R<U+0103>utu's monopoly on humanities is also credited with having incapacitated the development of independent ideas in Romanian philosophy and sociology, as well as with the near-complete elimination of psychology as a credible academic subject.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.17, 19, 28, 30-31</ref> Instructed by Gheorghiu-Dej, the Agitprop chief even targeted Romania's pre-communist Marxist current as the school of "[[Menshevik|Menshevism]]"<U+2014>announcing, in 1951, that [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], the father of Romanian [[social democracy]], was worthy of condemnation.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.19-20, 26, 112</ref> At the other end, he and Ionescu Gulian attacked the conservative opinion-maker, and Gherea's rival, Titu Maiorescu, as the icon of bourgeois conformity.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.111-113, 237</ref>

The neotraditionalist philosopher [[Lucian Blaga]], a contemporary of R<U+0103>utu's, was also vilified. Blaga was the target of ominous commentary in the communist newspapers, singled out for revenge by the communist poet [[Mihai Beniuc]], and ultimately derided in public by R<U+0103>utu.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.17, 30, 35</ref> Other main targets of R<U+0103>utu's [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] were [[Tudor Vianu]], [[Liviu Rusu]] (depicted as too idealistic) and Blaga's in-law [[Teodor Bugnariu]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.30, 35, 42, 95-96</ref> A young scholar at the time, [[Mihai <U+015E>ora]] described R<U+0103>utu as the object of a fearful myth: "a censor with such keen eyes, that one will find it impossible to slip by [and] a very cultivated man, finding great pleasure in reading bourgeois, Western etc. literature, the very same one he will publicly condemn."<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.137</ref> Pursuing his ideological condemnation of philology, R<U+0103>utu arrived at imposing [[Joseph Stalin]]'s own ''Marxism and Problems of Linguistics''. Marxist linguists who were not keen on adopting Stalin's perspective, including [[Alexandru Rosetti]], [[Alexandru Graur]] and [[Iorgu Iordan]], were investigated for "enemy-like activity", and left virtually unemployed until 1954.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.47-48</ref>

The young communist activist [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] was reporting to R<U+0103>utu in matters of sport. Their activity included a 1953 investigation of the [[CSA Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti|Central Army Club]], suspected of "caste-like" factionalism and of "placing [its] interests above the interests of national sport."<ref>{{ro icon}} Octavian Cojocaru, [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/ceausescu-e-adevarat-ca-am-facut-o-prostie-cand-am-distrus-flacara-ploiesti-812732.html "Ceau<U+015F>escu: 'E adev<U+0103>rat c<U+0103> am f<U+0103>cut o prostie c<U+00E2>nd am distrus Flac<U+0103>ra Ploie<U+015F>ti' "], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', July 18, 2008</ref>

==="Anti-Revisionism"===
[[File:Funeralii Stalin Dej.jpg|thumb|340px|March 1953: Gheorghiu-Dej (front row) returning from Stalin's funeral, and being met by party officials, including R<U+0103>utu (second row, middle, with [[Ghizela Vass]] and [[Mihail Roller]] on either side behind him)]]
R<U+0103>utu was still unchallenged as cultural policymaker even as Stalin died, although the Romanian regime contemplated structural changes. After 1956, essentially his only superior within the party was Gheorghiu-Dej, who cared little for cultural intrigues.<ref name="crime"/> At the VIIth party congress in December 1955, R<U+0103>utu became an alternate member of the politburo.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.44, 109, 445</ref> Shortly after, he began an investigation into the activities of [[Nicolae Labi<U+015F>]], the disillusioned Marxist poet. R<U+0103>utu signaled Labi<U+015F>'s fall into disgrace, declaring his piece "Murdered Albatross" to be pessimistic and unworthy of "building-sites that construct socialism."<ref>{{ro icon}} Mircea Colo<U+015F>enco, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Poetul-comunist-stigmatizat-de-comunisti*articleID_24753-articles_details.html "Poetul comunist <U+2013> stigmatizat de comuni<U+015F>ti"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 556-557, December 2010</ref> 

The tensions between Gheorghiu-Dej and Soviet ruler [[Nikita Khrushchev]] were highlighted during the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]]. Romania participated in the punitive expedition against [[Hungary]], R<U+0103>utu himself reported that the general public felt that Romania suffered "because of the terrible boners made by the Soviets in Hungary."<ref>Verona, p.108</ref> Documenting the reorientation of the mid 1950s, scholar [[Ken Jowitt]] included R<U+0103>utu and Gheorghiu-Dej's economic adviser, [[Alexandru B<U+00E2>rl<U+0103>deanu]], among the PMR "regime figures" who mediated "between the progressives and the Stalinists."<ref>[[Ken Jowitt]], ''Revolutionary Breakthroughs and National Development: The Case of Romania, 1944-1965'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley & Los Angeles, 1971, p.215-216.  ISBN 0-520-01762-5</ref> When Gheorghiu-Dej, who played the two factions against each other, decided to overturn some of the Zhdanovist measures adopted in the 1950s, he even described R<U+0103>utu and Mihail Roller as responsible for the PMR's frail relationship with the Romanian intellectuals.<ref>Ple<U+015F>a, p.174</ref>

R<U+0103>utu had another close call at the Party Plenary of June 1957: Chi<U+015F>inevschi and Constantinescu were both attacked by Gheorghiu-Dej as "[[Liberal socialism|liberal socialists]]" and "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]]", then expelled from the party's inner core.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.16, 28, 71-72, 111, 121</ref> Even though he was a Chi<U+015F>inevschi's confidants (and Natalia R<U+0103>utu was Chi<U+015F>inevschi's secretary),<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18, 32</ref> R<U+0103>utu managed to survive the incident, and preserved his standing. He expressed full support for Gheorghiu-Dej, and was even tasked by the communist leader with redacting the Plenary documents for public view. He collaborated on this task with Ceau<U+015F>escu, who was one of Gheorghiu-Dej's trusted men.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.16, 97-98, 111, 121</ref> 

His only potential rival was [[Grigore Preoteasa]], who joined the central committee's secretariat in charge of ideology shortly after Chi<U+015F>inevschi was sidelined. As Tism<U+0103>neanu notes, this was a chance for Romanian culture to be revisited "with a modicum of decency".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.35</ref> However, Preoteasa's death that November allowed R<U+0103>utu undisputed control over culture.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.35, 44, 96, 104-105, 147</ref> R<U+0103>utu himself was injured in the [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo Airfield]] accident that killed Preoteasa. His recovery in hospital brought an unexpected relaxation of censorship, which notably allowed ethnologists to write about the traditional Romanian dwellings (a theme that R<U+0103>utu would have otherwise proscribed) and translators to focus on contemporary literature.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.137-140</ref>

Upon returning, the PMR ideologist heralded an all-out [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionist]] campaign: his May 1958 speech began with attacks on the anti-Soviet [[Internationalist Communist Union]], Hungarian revolutionaries and "liberal theories"; went on to criticize Stalinist "dogmatism" and the "[[personality cult]]"; and eventually listed Romanian philosophers and artists who had deviated into one field or the other.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.349-380</ref> R<U+0103>utu reassessed his own political positioning, depicting Chi<U+015F>inevschi as a morbid Stalinist, and himself as a balanced figure.<ref name="tis27">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.27</ref> During June 1958, he and Gheorghiu-Dej produced a case against the PMR veteran [[Constantin Doncea]], who had been tempted to question Gheorghiu-Dej's claims of revolutionary primacy. R<U+0103>utu labeled Doncea a [[Titoism|Titoist]], then came up with claims that Doncea had followers in the cultural sphere<U+2014>a pretext for the verification of writers who still harbored modernist ideas.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.49-51, 106-107</ref> This happened even as R<U+0103>utu drafted a confidential note about improving relations with Yugoslavia and toning down anti-Titoist propaganda.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.344-346</ref>

The PMR cultural activists, R<U+0103>utu included, masterminded the [[show trial]] of philosopher [[Constantin Noica]], writer [[Dinu Pillat]] and other literary dissidents, all of them brutalized by the [[Securitate]] secret police.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.17, 102-103, 110</ref> He preserved much of his great influence, from directing the censorship apparatus (officially placed under [[Iosif Ardeleanu]]) to putting out ''Sc<U+00EE>nteia'' (approving of each issue before it went into printing).<ref name="tis115">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.115</ref>

===Transition to national communism===
While the regime veered into Stalinized [[national communism]], R<U+0103>utu engineered some of the newer campaigns to quash alternative culture, indicating suspects to the Securitate: communist writers [[Alexandru Jar]] and [[G<U+00E1>bor Ga<U+00E1>l]], attacked for having demanded [[de-Stalinization]]; modernist sculptor [[Mili<U+0163>a Petra<U+015F>cu]], "unmasked" as an opponent of the regime in a humiliating public session; and classical composer [[Mihail Andricu]], castigated for having exposed his appreciation for the West.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.17, 35, 50-51, 103-104</ref> Historian Stefano Bottoni argues that, in Jar's case, R<U+0103>utu may have set a trap for a former friend, inviting Jar to publicize his criticism of the PMR.<ref>Bottoni, p.207</ref> R<U+0103>utu also refused to reinstate the modernist poet-translator [[Ion Vinea]], calling him artistically irrelevant and an agent of [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|British Intelligence]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Sanda Cordo<U+015F>, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/nou/ro/anul-editorial-2008/cat_view/48-anul-editorial-2012.html "Ion Vinea <U+00EE>n timpul totalitarismelor (II)"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 3/2012, p.18, 20</ref> In 1960, he returned to the George C<U+0103>linescu issue, accusing him of deviating from the PMR program.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.91-92, 110</ref><ref name="sccalinescudej">{{ro icon}} [[<U+015E>tefan Cazimir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ntlnire_g._clinescu_-_gh._gheorghiu-dej "<U+00CE>nt<U+00EE>lnire G.

Tasked by the politburo with controlling the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]], Leonte R<U+0103>utu became a denouncer of the "[[Ioanid Gang]]". The name was applied to a cell of Jewish anti-communists who managed to rob the [[National Bank of Romania]]; captured, they were also accused of having plotted R<U+0103>utu's murder.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.23, 103</ref> Such issues troubled the cultural ideologist: R<U+0103>utu looked on as the Jews, discriminated against by the PMR's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] lobby, enlisted for emigration to [[Israel]]. R<U+0103>utu asked the party leaders not to strip all those who applied of their Romanian citizenship, and, responding to Gheorghiu-Dej's antisemitic comments, concluded that Romanian communism had failed at integrating the Jewish minority.<ref>Bottoni, p.273</ref> Eventually, R<U+0103>utu resigned himself to the others' views, and he may even have coined the slogan of [[Self-hating Jew|Jewish self-hatred]], which circulated among the predominantly Romanian PMR leadership: "Jews should lose their habit of controlling things".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.51</ref> As the party began expelling significant numbers of its Jewish members, a confidential note circulated at the top confirmed that, even in 1958, R<U+0103>utu was expressing strongly antisemitic feelings.<ref>"Lista documentelor/List of Documents", in Andreea Andreescu, Lucian Nastas<U+0103>, Andrea Varga (eds.), [http://www.edrc.ro/docs/docs/evreii/01_Introducere.pdf ''Minorit<U+0103><U+0163>i etnoculturale.

Similarly, R<U+0103>utu was among those sent in to pacify the [[Hungarians of Romania|Hungarian Romanian]] minority, and (Bottoni writes) played "the role of a nationalist", airbrushing [[Romanianization]] measures, demanding action against the "hostile elements" supporting [[Hungarian nationalism]], and participating in the disestablishment of [[Bolyai University]].<ref>Bottoni, p.284, 286</ref> From September 1959, controlling the spread of "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" among the Hungarians was a permanent task, assigned to a PMR committee presided upon by Ceau<U+015F>escu and R<U+0103>utu<U+2014>its other job, of promoting minority interests, was entirely ceremonial.<ref>Nastas<U+0103>, p.22-23, 65</ref>

Speaking at a 1962 short course session, R<U+0103>utu boasted that the 40,000 Agitprop Section activists had educated 1.4 million young Romanians, all of them inspired by the "party leaders' exigence" in the project to build a socialist society.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.381, 383, 393</ref> Some [[liberalization]] measures were nevertheless being unveiled, and R<U+0103>utu, officially introduced as a member of the [[Great National Assembly]], found himself included on Gheorghiu-Dej's official delegation to the [[United States]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18</ref> He was notoriously silent as his former colleagues and favorites were pushed into retirement (Moraru, <U+0162>ugui, Vitner)<ref name="tis27"/> or trapped in "unmasking" sessions. Beniuc and [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realist]] artist [[Constantin Baraschi]] both kept a grudge against R<U+0103>utu, who did not defend them when the national communists made them bear the blame.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.27, 113-115</ref> 

After having sidelined Sorin Toma, R<U+0103>utu revised his stance on the "decadent" poets, welcoming back into the spotlight modernists like Arghezi and [[Ion Barbu]], and even describing himself as a protector of artistic autonomy.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.33, 42, 99, 101-102, 116-117</ref> In 1962, he tacitly approved of the PMR's policy to politically (re)integrate some of Romania's more popular traditionalist intellectuals. However, R<U+0103>utu and other PMR leaders also singled out the Writers' Union chief, novelist [[Zaharia Stancu]], as a political suspect. According to literary historian [[Cornel Ungureanu]], R<U+0103>utu stated the point discreetly, "without aggravating the Great Chief [that is, Gheorghiu-Dej, who believed Stancu to be an earnest fellow communist]".<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Cornel Ungureanu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/zaharia_stancu_n_luptele_cu_nalta_societate "Zaharia Stancu, <U+00EE>n luptele cu '<U+00EE>nalta societate' "], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 15/2007</ref> By then, R<U+0103>utu was receiving letters from politically suspect writers such as [[P<U+0103>storel Teodoreanu]]<ref>{{ro icon}} Florina P<U+00EE>rjol, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/nou/ro/anul-editorial-2012/cat_view/45-anul-editorial-2011.html "Destinul unui formator de gusturi.

R<U+0103>utu still silenced critiques of Stalinism, but only by proxy. In 1963, on R<U+0103>utu's orders, Romania became, with [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country not to publish a vernacular translation of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich|Ivan Denisovich]]''.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.122-123</ref> 

By 1964, when Gheorghiu-Dej signaled Romania's detachment from the de-Stalinized Soviet Union, R<U+0103>utu was again called upon for ideological maneuvering. Gheorghiu-Dej sided with [[People's Republic of China|Red China]] in the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet divorce]], and Sino-Soviet helped redact the "April Theses", recognizing "the sovereign rights of each socialist state".<ref>{{ro icon}} Elis Neagoe-Ple<U+015F>a, [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_auash/annales_9/21%20eplesa.pdf "Rolul lui Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej <U+00EE>n elaborarea politicii externe <U+015F>i <U+00EE>n direc<U+0163>ionarea rela<U+0163>iilor rom<U+00E2>no-sovietice (1960-1965)"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_auash/auash_prezentare.html ''Series Historica''], 9/I, 2005, p.231-240</ref> He was afterward heard stating his disgust for past Sovietization, sending a shock-wave through academia when he spoke about those "who have shamefully kowtowed at even the most insignificant Soviet creation", and praised "national values" in the scientific field.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.28, 114</ref> He enabled Gheorghiu-Dej's anti-Hungarian rhetoric by sending him a report on the nationalistic statements made by various Hungarian authors and tolerated by the [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian communist government]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.439-442</ref> R<U+0103>utu also looked on as the regime allowed a partial recovery of his philosophical bugbears (Dobrogeanu-Gherea, then Maiorescu) and a controlled familiarization with Western literature or modernism.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.112-113, 114, 117, 118-119</ref>

Researched during 1965, the book was never completed.<ref>{{ro icon}} Lavinia Betea, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/adevaratul_ceausescu/Cum_a_obtinut_Ceausescu_diplomele_de_Bacalaureat_si_licenta_in_stiinte_economice_0_688731443.html# "Cum a ob<U+0163>inut Ceau<U+015F>escu diplomele de Bacalaureat <U+015F>i licen<U+0163><U+0103> <U+00EE>n <U+015F>tiin<U+0163>e economice"], in ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul]]'', April 25, 2012</ref>

Despite the protection he enjoyed, R<U+0103>utu found that his advancement within the party was curbed, with Ceau<U+015F>escu informing him that theirs was not an equal partnership.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.98-99, 121-122</ref> 1966 was thus a low point in R<U+0103>utu's career, as he was only tasked with supervising the interior commerce department and the Communist Youth's [[Pioneer movement|Pioneer]] branch. According to Tism<U+0103>neanu, R<U+0103>utu spent much of the interval reading up on political literature, including [[Neo-Marxism|Neo-Marxist]] authors frowned upon by the regime ([[Herbert Marcuse]]).<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.121-123</ref> Saving face, R<U+0103>utu showed personal initiative in interpreting the party line, and even anticipated Ceau<U+015F>escu's ideological permutations. After the ''[[July Theses]]'' of 1971 put a stop to liberalization and introduced the more repressive phase of national communism, he welcomed Ceau<U+015F>escu's commands as "a model in Marxist-Leninist analysis", and the subjugation of culture to political economy as "an active, revolutionary, attitude"; he also informed the party that the time had come for himself to reexamine his past and determine his own "mistakes".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.99-101</ref> At the lavishly furnished and overbudgeted Gheorghiu Academy,<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.54</ref> he set up a "Laboratory for Research into Contemporary Historical Progress", dedicated to defending communist dogma against "the illusion of [[technocracy]]". Tism<U+0103>neanu argues that this think tank was merely "bizarre"; he describes R<U+0103>utu's theories as "clich<U+00E9>s" or "platitudes".<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.34</ref> 

As rector, R<U+0103>utu presented the communist leader with a Ph. D. in Politics (on Ceau<U+015F>escu's 60th birthday, January 1978).<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.29, 161</ref> At the XIIth Party Congress in 1979, he issued a spontaneous and violent attack against fellow PCR veteran [[Constantin P<U+00EE>rvulescu]], who had taken the floor to ad-lib about Ceau<U+015F>escu's separation from Marxism.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Mih<U+0103>ie<U+015F>]], [http://www.romlit.ro/sa_ne_prefacem_ca_nici_n-am_au "S<U+0103> ne prefacem c<U+0103> nici n-am auzit"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 43/2006; Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.29, 48-49, 53-54, 127-128</ref> In a February 1980 speech that saw print in ''Sc<U+00EE>nteia'', he gave his retouched version of communist history: claiming to have been one of the first communists to take note of young Ceau<U+015F>escu's "exceptional courage and brilliant intelligence", he extended his gratitude to "my beloved Comrade Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu" for taking on the role of ideological guide in the eyes of "each and all party activists".<ref name="tis55">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.55</ref> In March, R<U+0103>utu was assigned to the central committee's commission on Ideology, Politics, Cultural and Socialist Education; in May, he returned as vice president of the Higher Council of Education.<ref name="tis53">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.53</ref> Also that year, he received two of Communist Romania's major distinctions: the [[Order of the Star of Romania|Star of the Socialist Republic]], 1st Class (granted, on his 70th birthday, for merits "in constructing the multilaterally developed socialist society"), and the 25th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation Medal.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.53, 54-55, 128, 162</ref>

===Downfall and final years===
From the mid 1970s, R<U+0103>utu was practically a widower. Natalia R<U+0103>utu, plagued by episodic [[migraine]]s since the 1940s, was diagnosed with [[viral encephalitis]] after slipping into a [[coma]]; she was kept under specialized care at [[Elias Hospital]], but never recovered.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.69-70</ref> The former head of Agitprop began noticing that the relatives of various communist potentates were using their relative freedom of travel and defecting to the West: knowing that his own family had little appreciation for Ceau<U+015F>escu, he expressed fears that, should the same happen to him, the central committee would never pardon it.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.56</ref> In 1981, his son-in-law Andrei Coler and his daughter Lena applied for emigration to the United States.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.56, 128-129</ref> In retribution for this move, but also accused of not having fulfilled his political tasks, R<U+0103>utu was made to present his resignation from the party's central committee; he was also made to renounce his rectorate.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.56-57, 128-129, 446-447</ref>

This left the former ideologist entirely isolated, a recluse on the Romanian political scene. In his report for the exile station [[Radio Free Europe]], [[No<U+00EB>l Bernard (journalist)|No<U+00EB>l Bernard]] assessed: "Nobody is going to shed tears over the fall of Leonte R<U+0103>utu."<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.15, 444</ref> Bernard also derided the communists' hypocrisy: R<U+0103>utu, he noted, had been forced out because his daughter emigrated; Miron Constantinescu advanced steadily, his own daughter a mentally disturbed [[matricide]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.57, 447-448</ref> Tism<U+0103>neanu adds: "The 'perfect acrobat' [fell] victim to the very dialectical-Balkanic mechanism that he so decisively helped generate. [...] R<U+0103>utu had been thrown into the grim anonymity that had consumed the last years of his so many associates in youthful daydreaming."<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.29</ref> R<U+0103>utu moved out into a regular house of protocol, and worked for the party's own History Institute.<ref name="tis129">Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.129</ref>

R<U+0103>utu's last years were marked by panic and confusion: although it gave him pleasure to see Ceau<U+015F>escu executed during the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], that event saw the formal destruction of a political and symbolic structure to which he had dedicated his life.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.36, 129</ref> An unverifiable rumor even places R<U+0103>utu among the fallen old-generation communists who prepared their return under a "[[Constantin D<U+0103>sc<U+0103>lescu]] Government".<ref>{{ro icon}} Mihaela Grancea, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/01/a-comemora-sau-a-celebra-ambiguitatile-istoriei-recente-si-ale-autoperceptiilor-legate-de-revolutia-din-decembrie-1989-ii/ "A comemora sau a celebra?

The [[History of Romania since 1989|post-revolutionary republic]] did not impinge on the privileges Leonte R<U+0103>utu had gained, as an old communist militant, under Gheorghiu-Dej. Legally included into a category of "[[Antifascism|antifascist]] combatants", he continued to receive a high pension and was admitted in for special medical care.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.160</ref> R<U+0103>utu gave his only in-depth interview to Pierre du Bois, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] political scientist, acknowledging that the communist system had produced tens of thousands of victims but expressing no remorse.<ref name="crime"/><ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.37, 42-43, 129</ref> He died shortly after, and was [[Cremation in Romania|cremated]] at ''Cenu<U+015F>a'' furnace, to the tune of ''[[The Internationale]]''.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.37</ref>

==Legacy==
According to Vladimir Tism<U+0103>neanu and Cristian Vasile, who cite various other authors, R<U+0103>utu was not just responsible for cultural repression, but also for the characteristically "ill-adapted", "dull", and "[[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]]" essence of Romanian communist propaganda, at all times between 1950 and 1989.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.57-59</ref> According to poet-journalist [[Radu Cosa<U+015F>u]] (himself a figure in 1950s literature), R<U+0103>utu is personally responsible for a slip of the [[wooden tongue]], allowing the notion of [[Eastern Bloc]] to be rendered in Romanian as ''lag<U+0103>rul socialist''<U+2014>which can also be read as "socialist concentration camp".<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosa<U+015F>u]], [http://arhiva.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?cmd=articol&nr=&id=10646 "C<U+0103>tre un inexistent colonel pensionar"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 320, January 2010</ref>

A renegade Stalinist and a defector, [[Petru Dumitriu]], satirized Leonte R<U+0103>utu (as "[[Malvolio]]") and Gheorghiu-Dej (as "[[Amon Ra]]") in political novels he wrote abroad. As Dumitriu's anti-hero, R<U+0103>utu goes from fiery intellectual to corrupt and surfeited bureaucrat.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.18, 22, 71, 146-147</ref> The mid to late 1960s ignited a bookish flare of indignation at home, when some of the intellectuals harmed by R<U+0103>utu's Stalinist policies took their literary revenge. In 1965, [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Union]] president [[Zaharia Stancu]] publicly asked Ceau<U+015F>escu to let R<U+0103>utu follow in the trail of Chi<U+015F>inevschi, identifying the former of two as a Stalinist mastermind. According to Stancu, Chi<U+015F>inevschi had been more of a "dilettante" pawn.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.98-99</ref> After personal tragedy led him to reconsider Stalinism (and possibly communism altogether), poet [[Eugen Jebeleanu]] also turned on R<U+0103>utu. The notion of "perfect acrobat", used by Tism<U+0103>neanu to qualify R<U+0103>utu's record as a political survivor, was originally the title of a Jebeleanu piece:

Marxist dissident [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]] portrayed R<U+0103>utu (as "Valeriu Trotu<U+015F>eanu") in the novel ''Cunoa<U+015F>tere de noapte'' ("Nightly Knowledge"): the fictional, cat-like, R<U+0103>utu spins a web of arguments, admitting his minor errors to divert focus from his crimes.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.34-35, 48, 49, 57, 115-116</ref> Critic [[Nicolae Drago<U+015F>]], who was in the process of moving from Stalinism to nationalism, made a point of saluting Ivasiuc's novel: his own editorial for ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'' review carried the unsettling title ''Te recunosc, domnule Trotu<U+015F>eanu'' ("I Recognize You, Mr. Trotu<U+015F>eanu").<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.34, 48, 116</ref> Presumably, the national communists allowed such works to see print because they helped remind R<U+0103>utu that he was always under their scrutiny.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.48-49</ref>

Although Ceau<U+015F>escu countersigned R<U+0103>utu's downfall, and allowed a condemnation of R<U+0103>utu's erstwhile proteges, little was published on the ideologist's own career, and almost no negative reinvestigation saw print before 1989. Researchers such as [[Ileana Vrancea]] and [[Ion Cristoiu]], who tackled the more delicate subjects of Stalinist culture and were condemned by the communist press as borderline dissidents, refrained from even mentioning R<U+0103>utu by name.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.31-32</ref> Benefiting from his seniority in the communist movement, academician [[Iorgu Iordan]] made at least one reference to R<U+0103>utu's problematic decision-making, even before R<U+0103>utu had been sidelined: Iordan's version of events is preserved in his 1979 memoirs.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.17, 31, 45-46, 48</ref> 

R<U+0103>utu's contribution as a propagandist was entirely absent from official reference works such as the 1978 biographical dictionary of Romanian historiography.<ref name="tis53"/> Although highly decorated and commended as a positive example, the Agitprop Section founder was generally introduced as a dedicated "party activist", a communist powerhouse rather than a national instructor: while honoring him with the Star of the Socialist Republic, Ceau<U+015F>escu made sure to remind the audience that R<U+0103>utu's history had its share of "minuses and unfulfilled chapters".<ref name="tis55"/>

A controversial perspective on R<U+0103>utu's public role and legacy was taken up from the late 1980s, with roots in the 1960s, by journalists and critics like [[Eugen Barbu]] or [[Mihai Ungheanu]]. Such authors, criticized in turn as [[xenophobic]] and even [[antisemitic]], suggest that there was a [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-and-communist conspiracy]] against the very spirit of Romanian culture.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.20-21, 117-119, 130</ref> This lobby, associated for a while with ''[[Luceaf<U+0103>rul (magazine)|Luceaf<U+0103>rul]]'' journal, was tolerated by Ceau<U+015F>escu as the radical facet of his national communism: Barbu and fellow novelist [[Ion L<U+0103>ncr<U+0103>njan]], who had debuted as orthodox Stalinists and had won R<U+0103>utu's approval, became proponents of the neotraditionalist revival.<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.102, 118-119</ref> In contrast to theirs, largely positive assessments of R<U+0103>utu survive in memoirs and interviews by Iliescu and by his Agitprop Section successor, [[Dumitru Popescu-Dumnezeu]].<ref>Tism<U+0103>neanu & Vasile, p.36-37, 51-52, 130</ref>

R<U+0103>utu's daughter Anca Oroveanu and her husband Mihai Oroveanu stayed behind in Romania after the Colers left for America, and continued to visit R<U+0103>utu.<ref name="tis129"/> Anca Oroveanu is an art historian, known for her studies in [[postmodern art]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Adelina Morcov, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ISTORIA-ARTEI.-Anca-OROVEANU-Rememorare-si-uitare*articleID_13317-articles_details.html "Istoria artei.
