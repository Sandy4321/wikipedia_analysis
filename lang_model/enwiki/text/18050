'''Orlando Jordan'''<ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/o/orlando-jordan.html|title=Orlando Jordan Profile|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> (born July 10, 1971)<ref name="OWOW"/> is a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who is currently working on the independent circuit. Jordan is perhaps best known for working for [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] on its ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' brand where he is a former [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]].

==Career==
===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003&ndash;2006)===
Jordan made his WWE TV debut on the May 31, 2003 episode of ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' defeating [[Jamie Noble]]. On June 26, 2003, Jordan made his first ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' appearance as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] against then-[[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] [[John Cena]].<ref name="SDdebut">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/06/27/121353.html|title=Smackdown!: Vince makes Zach a deal|date=2003-06-27|last=Plummer|first=Dale|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=SLAM! Sports}}</ref> Although he did not win the match, he was impressive enough that when Cena attacked Jordan after the match was over, [[The Undertaker]], with whom Cena was [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]], came to the ring and helped Jordan to his feet.<ref name="SDdebut"/>

[[Image:Thecabinet.jpg|left|thumb|Jordan was named "Chief of Staff" of John "Bradshaw" Layfield's (right) Cabinet.]]
After being a fan favorite for several months, Jordan [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] into a villain by joining [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]] (JBL)'s [[The Cabinet (professional wrestling)|Cabinet]] and being appointed as his "Chief of Staff".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/08/06/571420.html|title=Smackdown: Angle in action and auctioned|date=2004-08-06|last=Sokol|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=SLAM! Sports}}</ref> A few months after joining, Jordan began changing his look by growing out his hair. While a part of The Cabinet, Jordan, along with the [[Basham Brothers]] (who became the newly appointed "Co-Secretaries of Defense"), helped JBL manage to keep his [[WWE Championship]] for 9 months by interfering in his title matches against [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], and The Undertaker, who was the first person to show Jordan respect.

After JBL began a feud with [[John Cena]] over the WWE Title leading up to [[WrestleMania 21]], Jordan faced off with Cena on the March 3, 2005 edition of ''SmackDown!'' from the [[Times Union Center]] in [[Albany, New York]].<ref name="UStitle"/> Orlando defeated John Cena with the help of JBL to win his first and only [[WWE United States Championship]].<ref name="UStitle"/> After losing his WWE Title to John Cena at WrestleMania 21, JBL stated that his Cabinet had been holding him back, which led to the departure of the Bashams. At [[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]], Jordan started his biggest WWE feud by wrestling against [[Chris Benoit]]. Jordan defeated Benoit and retained his United States Championship after removing the turnbuckle pad and shoving Benoit head-first into the exposed steel and covered him for the win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2005/results/|title=The Great American Bash 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-11-15|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> Feeling cheated, Benoit continued to chase Jordan for the title. He finally defeated Jordan (in a record 25.5 seconds) at [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]] to win the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/history/302480|title=All-Time Summerslam Results|accessdate=2007-11-15|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> Following this quick match, Jordan attempted to win his title back on multiple occasions, leading to 3 consecutive losses with all matches lasting less than a minute. The first rematch lasted 23.4 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09012005/|title=Another Assist From Dad|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2007-12-31|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|quote=Amazingly, this time the match took a mere 23.4 seconds as Benoit made Jordan tap out again.}}</ref> During the second rematch, Jordan actually almost knocked out Benoit with a punch in the opening moments but still lost at 22.5 seconds, which was even faster than the first match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09092005/|title=Changing Friday nights|date=2005-09-09|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> During the third match, Jordan stalled until the time, which was being displayed on the TitanTron, went over 25 seconds.<ref name="49.8">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/09232005/|title=A miraculous recovery|date=2005-09-23|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> He got so excited when his time went over 30 seconds that he dropped his guard and Benoit took the opportunity to lock on the [[Chris Benoit#In wrestling|Sharpshooter]] for a win at the 49.8 second mark.<ref name="49.8"/> Earlier in the show, Orlando stated that he had mastered every counter to Benoit's signature [[Chris Benoit#In wrestling|Crippler Crossface]], which was shown when during the match every time Benoit attempted the Crippler Crossface, Jordan countered it.<ref name="49.8"/> After those unsuccessful rematches, Jordan later broke away from JBL, although both later made a few appearances together later on.

When [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] got injured half-way through his Best of Seven series for the United States Championship, he needed a replacement to face Chris Benoit.<ref name="Booker">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/12302005/|title=A shocking return leads to new Champs|date=2005-12-30|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> As the series was at 3-1 in Booker's favor, Booker T only needed his replacement to win one match in order to become the United States Champion.<ref name="Booker"/> Orlando approached him about the position but Booker T and his wife [[Sharmell Sullivan|Sharmell]] laughed in Orlando's face and made jokes about Orlando's quick tap-out losses to Benoit.<ref name="Booker"/> Booker would instead ask [[Randy Orton]] to substitute for him.<ref name="Booker"/> Orton, however, would fail to win the deciding match, leading Jordan to once again ask for the position the next week.<ref name="Booker"/><ref name="Booker2">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/01062006/|title=Making statements|date=2006-01-06|accessdate=2009-03-06|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> Booker T and his wife laughed at him and turned him down once again, however.<ref name="Booker2"/> During the sixth match in the series, Jordan jumped the rail, grabbed Booker T's crutch, and hit Chris Benoit for a disqualification finish.<ref name="Booker2"/> Chris Benoit was announced as the winner, tying the Best of Seven Series at 3-3.<ref name="Booker2"/> Jordan in fact botched the finish and accidentally hit Orton first but it was edited out of the show. The next week, Jordan ran to ringside to attempt to halt Booker T from winning the Championship but was unable to prevent Orton from eventually beating Chris Benoit and winning the series for Booker T.

WWE was attempting to push Orlando as a face, but when the fans failed to get behind him, he remained heel and his [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] was dropped after he was easily defeated by [[Marty Wright|The Boogeyman]] on the February 17, 2006 edition of ''SmackDown!''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/02172006/|title=Who's the better man?|date=2006-02-17|accessdate=2007-11-15|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref>

Orlando would then be pushed down to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' and won several matches there. Jordan made his final ''SmackDown!'' appearance on the May 12 edition of ''SmackDown!'' in a backstage segment telling [[James Maritato|Nunzio]] that he had seen someone who looked an awful lot like his partner [[Vito LoGrasso|Vito]] dressed in drag at a night club during the recent UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/05122006/|title=Tragic Homecoming|date=2006-05-12|last=Dee|first=Louie|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment}}</ref> Jordan's final WWE appearance was a loss to [[Brent Albright|Gunner Scott]] on the May 13 edition of ''Velocity''.

Orlando was then fired from the WWE on May 26, 2006 because of traveling with someone not authorized by WWE to travel with him.<ref name="rf">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&ID=201|title=RF Video|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=RF Video}}</ref> Before the release, there were plans for Jordan to be repackaged with a [[bisexual]] gimmick in a storyline that would have involved [[Stephanie Finochio|Trinity]] and a friend of Jordan's with no wrestling background,<ref name="rf"/> considered in some circles to be [[taboo]] in wrestling but was given the OK for Jordan since it is his [[Legit (professional wrestling)|real-life lifestyle]].<ref name="bi"/> The storyline was Jordan's idea, because the WWE creative team had no plans for him.<ref name="interview"/>

===Independent circuit (2006&ndash;present)===
Jordan soon began competing on the [[independent circuit]] soon after his WWE departure along with wrestling overseas, most notably for [[Nu-Wrestling Evolution]], a promotion based in Italy, as well as [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]. Jordan became NWE Champion in April 2008.  Later in that month, he was involved in a [[kayfabe|confrontation]] with the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]], leading to the return of Warrior after a 10 year absence to face Jordan in a match in June 2008. Jordan would lose the title to Warrior on June 25 in Barcelona.
