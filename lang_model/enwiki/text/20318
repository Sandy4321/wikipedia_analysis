'''''Prochilodus lineatus''''' (synonym ''P. platensis'') is a [[South America]]n species of [[ray-finned fish]] that inhabits the basin of the [[Paran<U+00E1> River]] and the [[Paraguay River]] in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] and [[Paraguay]], the Pilcomayo River in Bolivia, and the [[Para<U+00ED>ba do Sul]] River in [[Brazil]]. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] its common name is '''''s<U+00E1>balo'''''; in Brazil it receives the names '''''curimbat<U+00E1>''''', ''curimba'', ''corimbat<U+00E1>'' or ''grumat<U+00E3>''. In the [[United States]] it is also known by the technical synonym ''Tarpon prochilodus''. There are many other species of fish with the common name ''[[s<U+00E1>balo]]''; ''P. lineatus'' is therefore distinguished sometimes as ''s<U+00E1>balo jet<U+00F3>n'' (colloquial Spanish for "big-mouth") or ''chupabarro'' ("mud-sucker").

''P. lineatus'' has a maximum length of about 50-60 cm and measures up to 6 kg. Its body is tall and compressed, greenish-gray (lighter in the belly), with yellowish green fins. Its mouth is circular and projects towards the front; it has two series of small teeth.

This fish prefers deep waters and it is illiophagus, i. e. it sucks and eats organic mud, for which its mouth is especially adapted. This incidentally makes it difficult to fish with a bait. It migrates in large banks, looking for warm waters during the spring in order to lay its eggs.

==Situation in the Paran<U+00E1> River==

''P. lineatus'' is considered the key species of the Paran<U+00E1> River, since it forms the base of the [[food chain]] that ends with larger fish like the [[surub<U+00ED>]]. Regulations in place in [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province|Entre R<U+00ED>os]], Argentina, have proven ineffective to preserve the species, which is being severely exploited, both for internal consumption and for [[export]]. Experts estimate that capturing 20,000 [[tonne]]s of s<U+00E1>balo per year is the upper limit of [[sustainability]]. Exports, however, of about 13,000 tonnes in 1998, grew to 34,000 tonnes in 2004, after the [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] of the [[Argentine peso]] caused by the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|economic crisis]] tripled its local value.

As the fish population dwindles, fishermen who depend on their captures for their livelihood are keeping smaller specimens, often not mature and which therefore have had no time to reproduce.

Widespread disregard of prescribed [[fishing net|net]] sizes and the presence of illegal processing plants, which the local governments do not control, have compelled [[environmental movement|environmental]] groups to protest. The issue turned into a jurisdiction conflict when Santa Fe tightened the regulations in 2005, forbidding the capture of s<U+00E1>balos under 42 cm long, while Entre R<U+00ED>os kept the limit looser at 40 cm. On [[July 13]], about 400 fishermen blocked the [[Rosario]] access to the [[Rosario-Victoria Bridge]] that joins the two provinces. On [[August 1]], after Entre R<U+00ED>os matched its regulations with those of Santa Fe, 300 fishermen and freezing plant workers from [[Victoria, Entre R<U+00ED>os|Victoria]] did the same. They were pressured, according to certain claims, by the threat of [[unemployment]] if their plants cannot fill their export quotas.

In October 2006, largely to facilitate the reproduction of s<U+00E1>balo, the legislative branch of Santa Fe attempted to pass a temporary ban on commercial fishing in the Paran<U+00E1>. [http://www.lacapital.com.ar/2006/10/20/region/noticia_335924.shtml] This ban was vetoed by the executive, as it had no counterpart in the neighbouring Entre R<U+00ED>os. On [[21 December]] [[2006]], the national government banned exports of fish of the Paran<U+00E1> River for eight months starting on [[1 January]] [[2007]].
