==History==
=== Early years ===
[[File:GamlaIP.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Malm<U+00F6> IP, the first home stadium for the club between 1910 and 1957]]

The club arose from a municipal initiative in 1905 to encourage young people in Malm<U+00F6> to play organised football. One of the youth teams, Bollklubben Idrott, also known simply as BK Idrott, was a predecessor to Malm<U+00F6> FF. BK Idrott joined the newly created football department of [[IFK Malm<U+00F6>]] in 1909, but soon left because of issues between the two clubs. On 24 February 1910 the 19 members of BK Idrott founded Malm<U+00F6> FF; the first chairman was Werner M<U+00E5>rtensson.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 14<U+2013>16.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Historik/1910-1939.aspx | title=1910<U+2013>1939 |work=mff.se |accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref>

The club spent their first ten years in local and regional divisions as there was no official national league competition, playing the majority of their matches in the city division called Malm<U+00F6>m<U+00E4>sterskapen. They also competed in regional competitions in [[Scania]], and played matches against Danish clubs. In 1916 Malm<U+00F6> FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition (''Distrikm<U+00E4>sterskapen'') for the first time, playing against rival [[Helsingborgs IF]] but losing 3<U+2013>4.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 17.</ref> The club defeated local rival IFK Malm<U+00F6> three times during the season, and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malm<U+00F6>'s best football club.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref> In 1917 Malm<U+00F6> FF competed in [[Svenska M<U+00E4>sterskapet]] for the first time, a cup tournament for the title of [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish champions]], but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4<U+2013>1 against IFK Malm<U+00F6>. The club continued to play in the cup until 1922, reaching the quarter-finals in 1920 when they were knocked out by [[Landskrona BoIS]]. The cup was eventually discontinued and the title of Swedish champions was given to the winners of [[Allsvenskan]] which was first created for the [[1924-25 in Swedish football|1924<U+2013>25]] season.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 258.</ref>{{ref label|Swedish Champions|A|}}

In 1920 the [[Swedish Football Association]] invited Swedish football clubs to compete in official national competitions. Malm<U+00F6> FF earned a place in Division&nbsp;2 Sydsvenska Serien. They won this division in the first season, and were promoted to Svenska Serien V<U+00E4>stra, the highest level of competition in Sweden at the time. However, they were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] after a single season, and found themselves back in Sydsvenska Serien for nearly a decade until they again achieved promotion to Allsvenskan, in 1931.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref>

===First years in Allsvenskan and early achievements===
[[File:Guldlaget1944.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Malm<U+00F6> FF team of 1943<U+2013>44]]
The club achieved mid-table league positions for two seasons, but they were relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malm<U+00F6> FF were the only club to show it in their accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division&nbsp;2, the club suffered bans for the entire board of directors and twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malm<U+00F6> FF and local press suggests that local rival IFK Malm<U+00F6> reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.<ref name="Smitt25-26">Smitt, 2009, pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref><ref name="1934 scandal at malmo.se">{{Cite web| url=http://www.malmo.se/Medborgare/Kultur--noje/Arkiv--historia/Kulturarv-Malmo/L-O/Malmo-FF.html | title=Malm<U+00F6> FF |work=malmo.se |accessdate=2011-01-17|language=Swedish}}</ref><ref name="1934 scandal at sydsvenskan.se">{{Cite web| url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/dygnetrunt/article82640/Historia-po-himmaplan.html | title=Historia po himmaplan |work=sydsvenskan.se |accessdate=2011-01-17|language=Swedish}}</ref>

The club made their way back to Allsvenskan in 1937 after two seasons in Division&nbsp;2. In the same year [[Eric Persson]] was elected as chairman after being secretary since 1929, and held the position until 1974. Persson is regarded by club leaders and fans as the most important person in the club's history, as he turned the club professional in the 1970s and under his leadership the club went from being titleless in 1937 to holding ten Swedish championships by the end of the 1974 season.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 165.</ref> In 1939 the club reached their highest position yet, third place in Allsvenskan, nine points behind champions [[IF Elfsborg]]. Malm<U+00F6> FF's first [[List of Swedish football champions|Swedish championship]] came in 1944, when the club won the penultimate game of the season against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] before 36,000 spectators at [[R<U+00E5>sunda]].  The last game of the season was won 7<U+2013>0 against [[Halmstad BK]].<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 27<U+2013>35.</ref>

For the next nine seasons, Malm<U+00F6> FF finished in the top three in the league. The club won the Swedish Championship in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953, and were runners-up in 1946, 1948 and 1952. The club also won [[Svenska Cupen]] in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1951 and 1953, and finished as runners-up in 1945. Between 6 May 1949 and 1 June 1951, the team were unbeaten in 49 matches, of which 23 were an unbroken streak of victories.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 40<U+2013>48.</ref>[[File:Malmoffplayers1962.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Young players in the 1960s]]

The club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan twice more, in 1956 and 1957. The following year the club left Malm<U+00F6> IP for [[Malm<U+00F6> Stadion]], which had been built for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], and was to host the club for the next 50 years. In 1964 Malm<U+00F6> FF contracted Spanish manager [[Antonio Dur<U+00E1>n]]; this was the first of a series of changes that led to the most successful era in the club's history. Young talents such as Lars Granstr<U+00F6>m and [[Bo Larsson]] emerged during the early 1960s and would prove to be crucial ingredients in the success that would come in the 1970s. The club finished second in 1964 but went on to win their sixth Swedish Championship in 1965, when Bo Larsson scored 28 goals to finish as the league's top goal scorer. Malm<U+00F6> FF once again won Allsvenskan in 1967, after a less successful year in 1966. The club's young players, as well as talents bought in from neighbouring clubs in Scania in 1967, became a team that consistently finished in the top three in Allsvenskan.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 49<U+2013>58.</ref>

===Successful 1970s, European Cup 1979, 1980s and 1990s===
After finishing as runners-up in Allsvenskan for the final two years of the 1960s, Malm<U+00F6> FF started the most successful decade of their history with a Swedish Championship in 1970. The club won Allsvenskan in 1970, 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1977 as well as Svenska Cupen in 1976 and 1978. The 1977 Allsvenskan victory qualified the club for the [[1978<U+2013>79 European Cup]], and after victories against [[AS Monaco]], [[Dynamo Kiev]], [[Wisla Krakow]] and [[Austria Wien]], they reached the final of the competition, which they played at [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in [[Munich]] against [[Nottingham Forest]]. [[Trevor Francis]], who scored the only goal of the match, won it 1<U+2013>0 for Forest. Nevertheless the 1979 European Cup run is the biggest success in the history of Malm<U+00F6> FF.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 58<U+2013>67.</ref> The team were given the [[Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal]] the same year, awarded for the most significant Swedish sporting achievement of the year, for their achievement in the European Cup.<ref name="Svdmedal"/>[[File:Malm<U+00F6> stadion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Malm<U+00F6> Stadion, the home stadium for the club between 1958 and 2008]]

Much of the success during the 1970s was due to new tactics and training methods brought to the club by Englishman [[Bob Houghton]], who managed the club between 1974 and 1980. Eric Persson was succeeded as chairman in 1974 by [[Hans Cavalli-Bj<U+00F6>rkman]]. After the team performed respectably under managers [[Keith Blunt]] and [[Tord Grip]] in the early 1980s, [[Roy Hodgson]] took over in 1985. He led the club to two Swedish Championships in 1986 and 1988, and the club won Allsvenskan five years in a row between 1985 and 1989. At the time, the championship was decided by play-offs between the best teams after the end of the regular season; this arrangement was in place from 1982 until 1992. The club reached the play-off final four times between 1986 and 1989 but only managed to win the final twice. Apart from Allsvenskan and Swedish Championships, the club won Svenska Cupen in 1984, 1986 and 1989.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 76<U+2013>80.</ref>

Other than finishing as runners-up in Allsvenskan in 1996, the team did not excel in the 1990s, as the club failed to win Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen throughout the entire decade. The 1990s ended with relegation from Allsvenskan in 1999. Hans Cavalli-Bj<U+00F6>rkman was succeeded as chairman by [[Bengt Madsen]] in 1999, and former player [[Hasse Borg]] was contracted as Director of Sport. These operational changes, as well as the emergence of young talent [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi<U+0107>]], led to the return to Allsvenskan in 2001. Ibrahimovi<U+0107> rose to fame and became an important player in the club's campaign to return to the top league. He was later sold to [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]] in 2001, before playing for [[Juventus]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[FC Barcelona]] and eventually [[AC Milan]] in 2010.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 84<U+2013>90.</ref>

===Start of the 2000s to the present===
[[File:Bosselarssonpremi<U+00E4>r.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Opening game at Swedbank Stadion]]The return to Allsvenskan was the start of the successful early 2000s, under the management of [[Tom Prahl]], when the club finished in the top three three times in a row. In 2004, it won Allsvenskan, the club's fifteenth Swedish Championship. In 2005 the club reached the last qualifying round for the [[UEFA Champions League]] but were defeated by [[FC Thun]]. Successful sponsor work and player sales also made Malm<U+00F6> FF the richest club in Sweden, a position they still hold as of 2011.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.idrottensaffarer.se/affarer/2009/02/mff-ar-sveriges-rikaste-klubb | title=MFF <U+00E4>r Sveriges rikaste klubb |work=idrottensaffarer.se|accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> The club moved from Malm<U+00F6> Stadion to [[Swedbank Stadion]] in 2009, a stadium built entirely for football and located next to the old one.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 94<U+2013>95.</ref>

In 2009, Madsen announced that he would step down as chairman, and was replaced by [[H<U+00E5>kan Jeppsson]] early the following year.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2010-02-19_Arsmotet.aspx | title=V<U+00E4>lbes<U+00F6>kt <U+00E5>rsm<U+00F6>te valde H<U+00E5>kan Jeppsson till ny ordf<U+00F6>rande |work=mff.se|accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref>
In 2010 the club marked their 100th anniversary with many celebratory events at the beginning of the season. On the day of the club's 100th anniversary in 2010, the Swedish football magazine ''[[Offside (magazine)|Offside]]'' declared Malm<U+00F6> FF to be the greatest football club in Swedish history.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Regnell |first1=Tobias |last2=Yst<U+00E8>n |first2=Henrik |year=2010 |title=St<U+00F6>rst i Sverige |journal=Offside |issue=2 |pages=64<U+2013>81 |publisher=Offside|language=Swedish|issn=1404-6822| url=http://www.offside.org/magasinet/smyglaesning.aspx?id=4605&templateName=preview|accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref> The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became Swedish champions for the sixteenth time.<ref name="2010 championship">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2010-11-07_SM-GULD.aspx | title=Malm<U+00F6> FF <U+2013> Svenska m<U+00E4>stare 2010 |work=mff.se|accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> Unlike in 2004, these successes were achieved without any major transfers before the season, and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/arkiv/svensk-fotboll/2010/12/det-hanger-pa-de-unga-/ | title=Det h<U+00E4>nger p<U+00E5> de unga |work=svenskfotboll.se|accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> The club remain one of the dominant football clubs in Sweden.

The club are often known by the nicknames ''Di bl<U+00E5>e'' (The Blues) and ''Himmelsbl<U+00E5>tt'' (The Sky Blues). This is because of the club colours, sky blue and white. The players wear sky-blue shirts, white shorts, and sky-blue socks. The away colours are red and white striped shirts, black shorts, and red socks. Various alternative kits have been used for European play such as all-white kits introduced in the 1950s and all-black kits with sky-blue and golden edges and text used for European play in 2005.<ref name="T<U+00F6>rner, Ole; p. 40">T<U+00F6>rner, 2005, p. 40.</ref>

The club colours have not always been sky blue. The predecessor club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used for the first six months of 1910 after Malm<U+00F6> FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to symbolise that Malm<U+00F6> FF were a new club, and a very similar kit is now used as the away kit for historical reasons. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 16, 20.</ref> Since 2010 a small [[Flag of Scania|Scanian flag]] is featured on the back of the shirt just below the neck.<ref name="2010 kit">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2009-12-09_Jubileumstrojan.aspx | title=Nu sl<U+00E4>pper vi matchtr<U+00F6>jan f<U+00F6>r jubileumss<U+00E4>songen!|work=mff.se|accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref>

The crest of Malm<U+00F6> FF consists of a shield with two vertical sky-blue fields on the sides, and one vertical white field in the middle. Underneath the shield is "Malm<U+00F6> FF" spelled out in sky-blue letters with a sky-blue star under the text. In the top area of the shield is a white horizontal field over the three vertical fields. The abbreviation of the club name "MFF" is spelled out with sky-blue letters in this field. On top of the shield are five tower-like extensions of the white field. The present shield crest made its debut on the shirt in the 1940s.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 20.</ref> There were other crests before this but they were never featured on the shirt. While the first crest was black and white, the second crest was red and white in accordance with the club's main colours between 1910 and 1920.<ref name="T<U+00F6>rner, Ole; p. 40"/>

In modern times a [[Star (football crest)#Club_teams|golden star]] has been added over the shield. This is a feature used only on the crests on player shirts. The star is used to symbolize that the club have won more than ten domestic titles. In the original shield logo the full club name and sky-blue star beneath the shield were not featured, they were later added when club chairman [[Eric Persson]] discovered while abroad that people had trouble identifying what city the club came from just by looking at the club crest. For the 100th anniversary of the club in 2010, the years 1910 and 2010 were featured on each side of the shield on a sky-blue ribbon behind the shield.<ref name="2010 kit"/>

Malm<U+00F6> FF are well known for their large local following.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/arkiv/svensk-fotboll/2010/11/publik2010/ | title=Malm<U+00F6> i topp <U+00E4>ven i publikligan |work=svenskfotboll.se |accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> The club have several fan clubs, of which the largest is the official fan club [[MFF Support]]. It was founded in 1992. MFF Support describes itself as "an idealistic and non-political association working against violence and racism".<ref name="Support"/> The current chairman of MFF Support is Ola Sol<U+00E9>r.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/article568950/Han-blir-ny-basbrfor-MFF-Support.html | title=Han blir ny bas f<U+00F6>r MFF Support |work=sydsvenskan.se |accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref>

There are also several smaller independent supporter groups. The most prominent of these is Supras Malm<U+00F6>, which was founded in 2003 by a coalition of smaller [[ultras]] groups and devoted fans.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sm03.wordpress.com/manifest2/ | title=Manifest |work=suprasmalmo.se |accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> The name "Supras" is derived from the words ''supporters'' and ''ultras'' <U+2013> the latter indicating that the group is inspired by a fan culture with roots in the [[Mediterranean]]. Supras Malm<U+00F6> is the most visible group in the main supporter stand at [[Swedbank Stadion]], marking its presence with banners, flags and choreography. Another group with similar goals is Rex Scania. MFF Tifosi 96 is a network of supporters creating [[tifo]]s for special occasions and important games.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff-familjen.se/mff-tifosi-96/vad-aer-mt96/ | title=Vad <U+00E4>r MT96?|work=mff-familjen.se |accessdate=2010-12-17|language=Swedish}}</ref> The average attendance for the club's games in the 2010 season was 15,194, the best attendance in [[Allsvenskan 2010]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/statistikligor/?scr=spl&sortby=home_avg | title=Statistik/ligor |work=svenskfotboll.se |accessdate=2010-11-07|language=Swedish}}</ref>

Because of geographical proximity, minor rivalries exist with [[Trelleborgs FF]] and [[Landskrona BoIS]], which are both also located in Scania.<ref name="T<U+00F6>rner52-54">T<U+00F6>rner, 2005, pp. 52<U+2013>54.</ref> The main rivals of the club are [[Helsingborgs IF]], [[IFK G<U+00F6>teborg]] and [[IFK Malm<U+00F6>]]. The rivalry between Malm<U+00F6> FF and Helsingborgs IF has existed since Malm<U+00F6> FF were promoted up to [[Allsvenskan]] in the 1930s, and is primarily geographic, since both teams are from [[Scania]] in southern Sweden. The rivalry with IFK G<U+00F6>teborg relates more to title clashes; the two are the most successful clubs in Swedish football history and the only two to have appeared in European cup finals, IFK G<U+00F6>teborg in the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[1982 UEFA Cup Final|1982]] and [[1987 UEFA Cup Final|1987]] and Malm<U+00F6> FF in the [[European Cup]] in [[1979 European Cup Final|1979]].<ref name="T<U+00F6>rner52-54">T<U+00F6>rner, 2005, pp. 52<U+2013>54.</ref>

The rivalry with IFK Malm<U+00F6> is both geographical and historical. The two clubs come from the same city and used to play at the same stadium in the early 20th&nbsp;century. The supposed actions of board members of IFK Malm<U+00F6> in 1933, revealing Malm<U+00F6> FF's breaches of amateur football rules to the [[Swedish Football Association]], further contribute to the competitive tensions between the two clubs.<ref name="Smitt25-26"/><ref name="1934 scandal at malmo.se"/><ref name="1934 scandal at sydsvenskan.se"/> IFK Malm<U+00F6> have not played in Allsvenskan since 1962; thus matches between the two sides are rare.<ref>T<U+00F6>rner, 2005, pp. 58<U+2013>59.</ref>

==Stadiums==
{{See also|Malm<U+00F6> IP|Malm<U+00F6> Stadion|Swedbank Stadion}}
Malm<U+00F6> FF's first stadium was [[Malm<U+00F6> IP]], which was shared with arch-rivals [[IFK Malm<U+00F6>]]. The team played here from the founding of the club in 1910, until 1958. The stadium still exists today, albeit with lower capacity, and is now used by women's team [[LdB FC Malm<U+00F6>]], who were previously the women's section of Malm<U+00F6> FF. Capacity in 2011 is 7,600, but attendances were usually much higher when Malm<U+00F6> FF played there. For the last season in 1957, the average attendance was 15,500. The club's record attendance at Malm<U+00F6> IP is 22,436 against [[Helsingborgs IF]] on 1 June 1956.<ref name="40-69">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/Historik/1940-1969.aspx | title=1940<U+2013>1969 |work=mff.se |accessdate=2009-11-24|language=Swedish}}</ref> The stadium is still considered a key part of the club's history, as it was here that the club were founded, played their first 47 seasons, and won five Swedish championships.<ref>Smitt, 2009, pp. 12<U+2013>13.</ref>

A new stadium was constructed in [[Malm<U+00F6>]] after Sweden was awarded the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] <U+2013> this saw the birth of [[Malm<U+00F6> Stadion]].  Malm<U+00F6> FF played their first season at the stadium in 1958. The first time the club won the Swedish championship at the stadium was in 1965.<ref name="40-69"/> An upper tier was added to the stadium in the 1980s, and was completed in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sydsvenskan.se/malmo/article324352.ece | title=Malm<U+00F6> kan f<U+00E5> tre nya badhus |work=sydsvenskan.se |accessdate=2009-11-24|language=Swedish}}</ref> The club enjoyed the most successful era of their history at this stadium, winning ten out of sixteen Swedish championships while based there. The stadium originally had a capacity of 30,000 but this was lowered to 27,500 due to changes in safety regulations. The club's record attendance at the stadium was 29,328 against Helsingborgs IF on 24 September 1967.<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 50.</ref>

Following the [[Allsvenskan 2004|2004 victory in Allsvenskan]],<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/tidigare-ar/resultat-2004/ | title=Femtonde SM-guldet till Malm<U+00F6> FF |work=svd.se |accessdate=2011-02-07|language=Swedish}}</ref> plans were made to construct a new stadium. In July 2005, Malm<U+00F6> FF announced that work was to begin on [[Swedbank Stadion]], designed for 18,000 seated spectators and 6,000 standing. The stadium can also accommodate 21,000 as an [[All-seater stadium|all-seater]] for international and European games in which [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] is not allowed. Construction started in 2007 and was finished in 2009. The new stadium is located next to Malm<U+00F6> Stadion. Although there was still small-scale construction going on around the stadium at the time, the stadium was inaugurated on 13 April 2009 with the first home game of the 2009 season against [[<U+00D6>rgryte IS]]; Malm<U+00F6> FF's [[Labinot Harbuzi]] scored the inaugural goal in the 61st minute.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/fotboll/mff/article426117/Storseger-for-MFF-i-hemmapremiaren.html | title=Storseger f<U+00F6>r MFF i hemmapremi<U+00E4>ren |work=sydsvenskan.se |accessdate=2009-11-24|language=Swedish}}</ref> The first Swedish championship won at the stadium occurred in 2010, when the club beat [[Mj<U+00E4>llby AIF]] on 7 November in the final game of the season 2<U+2013>0.

==Ownership and finances==
Malm<U+00F6> FF made the transition from an amateur club to fully professional in the late 1970s under the leadership of club chairman [[Eric Persson]].<ref>Smitt, 2009, p. 168.</ref> The club are an open member association, and the annual general meeting is the highest policy-making body where each member has one vote, therefore no shares are issued.

The club's legal status means that any interest claims are made to the club and not to the board of directors or club members. Daily operations are run by a managing director who liaises with the chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mff.se/Ditt_MFF/Om_klubben/~/media/MFF/Dokument/Arsredovisningar/MFFStadgar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Stadgar f<U+00F6>r Malm<U+00F6> Fotbollf<U+00F6>rening|publisher=Malm<U+00F6> FF|accessdate=2011-03-03|year=2011|language=Swedish}}</ref>

==Footnotes==
:A.&nbsp;{{note|Swedish Champions}}The title of "Swedish Champions" has been awarded to the winner of four different competitions over the years. Between 1896 and 1925 the title was awarded to the winner of [[Svenska M<U+00E4>sterskapet]], a stand-alone cup tournament. No club were given the title between 1926 and 1930 even though the first-tier league [[Allsvenskan]] was played. In 1931 the title was reinstated and awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan. Between 1982 and 1990 a [[Allsvenskan play-offs|play-off]] in cup format was held at the end of the league season to decide the champions. After the play-off format in 1991 and 1992 the title was decided by the winner of [[M<U+00E4>sterskapsserien]], an additional league after the end of Allsvenskan. Since the 1993 season the title has once again been awarded to the winner of Allsvenskan.<ref name="Allsvenskan & Swedish champions"/>
