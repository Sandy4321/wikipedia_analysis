'''''Heathen Chemistry''''' is the fifth studio album by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], released in 2002 through [[Big Brother Recordings|Big Brother Records]].

The album was written and recorded with a back-to-basics sound with a more rock feel to it; the more crude and simple sound differs from the musical grandiosity of their previous records, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' and ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', being more comparable to their early work.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

''Heathen Chemistry'' would prove to be last album to feature the band's longtime drummer, [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], who left in early 2004, with Noel Gallagher claiming White's commitment to the band was not adequate. He was effectively replaced with [[Ringo Starr]]'s son, [[Zak Starkey]].

The name Heathen Chemistry was taken from a second hand T-shirt that Noel had stumbled across.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/user/oasisinetofficial Youtube-Oasisnetofficial]</ref>

==Recording==
''Heathen Chemistry'' was recorded during 2001<U+2013>early 2002 and is the first Oasis album to have significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]]. Front man [[Liam Gallagher]] contributed three songs, and new bassist [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]] and rhythm guitarist [[Gem Archer]] contributed one song each as well.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453242/20020403/oasis.jhtml "Oasis Turn to Heathens, Hedonism for Inspiration on New LP"]. mtv.com. 3 April 2002.</ref>

Although most of the song's instrumentation was complete by mid-to-late 2001, Noel indicated that the release date of the album was being needlessly delayed by Liam's apparent reluctance to lay down his vocal parts at recording sessions, and went on to state that he was "livid" at the lack of work being done:

::"''I was really happy with (the album) until recently, but I'm fucking livid now. I finished my bits three-and-a-half months ago, and then we handed it over to Liam, and in three-and-a-half months he's done nothing. Just concentrated on his drinking habit again. It's just drifting at the moment.''

::''All the backing tracks are done and it's a fantastic album of instrumentals. Hand it over to the singer and it just slows down and becomes this one really long, drawn-out, painful process. So, to be honest with you, I don't know when it'll come out now. It's down to him.''"<ref>"Noel 'livid' as Liam delays new Oasis album", [[NME]] Online, 11 October 2001</ref>

Despite the setbacks during the recording process, when the album was finally complete Noel was confident that it was the group's second best album to date, behind their debut ''[[Definitely Maybe (album)|Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref>Downey, Ryan J. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453989/20020515/oasis.jhtml?headlines=true "Oasis Set Up U.S. Tour Whether Liam Likes It Or Not"]. mtvnews.com. 16 May 2002.</ref>

The title of the album, according to Noel, came from a t-shirt he bought in [[Ibiza]] which featured a logo reading, "The Society of Heathen Chemists". Similarly, the name of the first single, "The Hindu Times", originated from a logo on a t-shirt that read the same thing, which Noel saw during a photo shoot for GQ's 100 Greatest Guitarists edition. The name was given to the track when it was just an instrumental and the name stuck once the track was finished.

==Release==
The release of the album was overshadowed by an [[Internet leak]] of all 11 songs almost three months prior to release, which was evident at a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] show the group performed where fans knew the words to several new songs before the album's release.<ref>Goldner, Jonathan. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453651/20020429/oasis.jhtml "Oasis Badger 'Thieving' Fans At Las Vegas Gig"]. MTV.com. 29 April 2002.</ref> However, listeners of the commercially released album heard slight differences to two tracks, "Little by Little" and "Better Man."

The length of track 11 is 38:03, this is because of a hidden track called "The Cage", which begins after 30 minutes of silence.

The album has sold around one million copies in the UK, being certified triple platinum,<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=30757 ''Heathen Chemistry'' certification]. [[British Phonographic Industry]]. Accessed on 25 January 2009.</ref> and 154,000 copies in the US.<ref name="U.S. sales">Cohen. Jonathan.

''Billboard''. 23 January 2009.</ref> Upon release, ''Heathen Chemistry'' went straight to number one in the UK, though it fared rather poorly in the US, only entering at number 23.

It was the 11th biggest selling album of 2002 in the UK with just over 800,000 copies sold.

It spawned four singles, each of which made the top three in the UK charts: "[[The Hindu Times]]", their sixth number one single in the UK, "[[Stop Crying Your Heart Out]]","[[Little by Little (Oasis song)|Little By Little]]/[[She Is Love]]", the [[double A-side]] sung by [[Noel Gallagher]], and "[[Songbird (Oasis song)|Songbird]]", the first single written by Liam.

}}
Reception for the album, which garnered a [[Metacritic]] score of 55 out of 100 (indicating mixed to average reviews), varied wildly. Some reviewers noted that it was better than the band's last effort, ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', with [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] writing that Oasis was "a band back on track", and CDNow.com even remarking that ''Heathen Chemistry'' found "the quintet back in cracking mid-'90s form". However, a number of other reviewers savaged the album; notably, [[Drowned in Sound]] assigned it a rating of 1 out of 10, [[Pitchfork Media]] handed it a 1.2 out of 10 (criticizing it as a banal repackaging of previous Oasis works), and [[Stylus Magazine]] gave it a 'D' grade.
