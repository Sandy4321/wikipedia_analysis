"'''Aubrey'''" is the twelfth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] of the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', and the thirty-sixth episode overall. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] network in the United States on {{nowrap|January 6, 1995}}. It was written by Sara B. Charno and directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Aubrey" received a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.2 and was watched by 9.7 million households. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully believe that a serial killer from the 1940s passed his genetic trait of violence to his grandchild after a detective, BJ Morrow (Deborah Strang) mysteriously uncovers the remains of an FBI agent who disappeared almost fifty years before while investigating a modern-day murder case similar to the older cold case.

Although "Aubrey" was written by Charno, [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]], who had written for ''The X-Files'' before, provided additional contributions to the story. The story for the episode developed around the concept of 50 year old murders and the transfer of genetic memory. This was later combined with a separate concept about a female serial killer. [[Terry O'Quinn]], who guest stars in the episode, would later play roles in the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|feature film]], the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] episode "[[Trust No 1]]", become a recurring character as [[Peter Watts (Millennium)|Peter Watts]] on ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', and appear on the short-lived series ''[[Harsh Realm]]''. Strang's work on the episode was submitted for [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] consideration.

== Plot ==

In Aubrey, [[Missouri]] Detective BJ Morrow tells Lt. Brian Tillman ([[Terry O'Quinn]]), whom she is having an affair with, that she is pregnant. He requests she meet him at a motel later that night. While waiting for him she has a vision that leads her to a field where she digs up the remains of an FBI agent. Agent [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) head to Aubrey to investigate. The remains are those of agent Sam Cheney, who was investigating three murders in Aubrey in 1942 with partner Sam Ledbetter, both of whom disappeared. The agents find discrepancies in BJ's story but Tillman defends her. Mulder tells Scully of the case the agents were investigating, which involved three women raped and murdered with the word "Sister" slashed on their chest. Discovering similar cuts on Cheney's chest the autopsy reveals it to spell "Brother". BJ admits her affair and pregnancy to Scully.

Tillman reveals that a new murder has occurred where a woman had the word "Sister" slashed on her chest. BJ claims to have seen the victim in her dreams. She tells the agents of her vision, involving a man with a rash on his face and a monument that Mulder recognizes as the [[Trylon and Perisphere]] from the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. Searching old mug shot photos, BJ recognizes the man from her dream as Harry Cokely, who was arrested for raping a woman named Linda Thibedeaux and slashing "Sister" on her chest. Scully believes that BJ [[cryptomnesia|unconsciously recalled the case]] since her father was a cop and may have discussed it. The agents visit Cokely, now out of prison and old and feeble, requiring an oxygen machine. Cokely insists he was at his home when the murder occurred.

BJ awakens from a nightmare covered in blood, the word "Sister" slashed into her chest. She sees a young Cokely in the mirror. She heads to a basement and tears away the floorboards, revealing a body within that is found to be Ledbetter's. Cokely is arrested, who denies attacking her. Scully tells Mulder that blood on the latest victim matches Cokely's. The agents visit Thibedeaux who describes the rape in the 1940s. Mulder notices a photo of her at the 1939 World's Fair featuring the Trylon and Perisphere. When pressed, she reveals that the rape resulted in a child, which she put up for adoption.  The FBI tracks down the child, who turns out to have been BJ's father, causing Mulder to surmise that BJ is the killer and may be operating on genetic memories.

As the agents are on their way to intercept her, BJ attacks Thibedeaux, but stops when she sees the "Sister" scars on her chest. The agents find Thibedeaux after BJ has left, and head to Cokely's house, believing him to be her next target. BJ, who has already arrived, cuts Cokely's respirator and attacks him with a razor. When the agents arrive BJ attacks Mulder but when Cokely dies she stops. BJ is placed in Shamrock Women's Prison Psychiatric Ward where she is put on suicide watch after attempting to self-abort.<ref name="plot1">Lowry, pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref><ref name="plot2">Lovece, pp.138<U+2013>140</ref>

The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the episode a B, describing it as "a well-paced murder mystery with an inventive wrap-up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295179_3,00.html|title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 2|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=29 November 1996|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two positively critiqued the episode's "character study" of BJ Morrow, noting that it "makes this episode stand out". Shearman and Pearson also complimented Strang's performance, writing that she "seizes the part and gives it dignity." However, the two were critical of the genetic defect, arguing that, because Strang's character is fleshed out, the reveal turns her into "a puppet of the paranormal".<ref name="shearman">Shearman and Pearson, pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref> Critical Myth reviewer John Keegan gave the episode a 7 out 10 rating and wrote that, "Overall, this episode opens some interesting doors, adding the concept of genetic memory to the list of phenomena that cannot be explained in fully material terms. While the plot makes a certain amount of sense, there are a number of convenient moments that take away from the whole. But the end result is a strong episode."<ref>{{cite web|last=Keegan|first=John|title=Aubrey|url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season2/2-12.html|publisher=Critical Myth|accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref>

Other reviews were more mixed. Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that most of "Aubrey" was "fun", although BJ was not "particularly interesting". He stated that things got "dicey" for him around the revelation about Thibedeaux's child and that he did not buy Mulder's genetic impulse theories. He criticised the ending, writing that it "[sacrificed] whatever mood and character development the previous thirty had spent establishing for cheesy theatrics, and the whole thing lands with a resounding thud. There are too many problems with the concept; the nature/nurture debate has been going on for decades, and this ep throws the whole thing out the window in about two minutes. No other cause for BJ's actions is ever given... That's some lazy writing right there."<ref>{{cite web|first=Zack|last=Handlen|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/red-museumexcelsis-deiaubrey,13160/|title=Red Museum/Excelsis Dei/Aubrey|work=[[The A.V.
