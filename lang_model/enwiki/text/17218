'''John IV of Saxe-Lauenburg''' ({{lang-de|Johannes von Sachsen-Lauenburg}}) (ca. 1483 <U+2013> 1547) was a [[Bishop]] of [[Hildesheim]].

The son of Duke [[John V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg|John V]] of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] (who is also known, confusingly, as John IV) was elected as Bishop of Hildesheim, after his brother and predecessor in office [[Eric II of Saxe-Lauenburg (prince-bishop)|Eric]] had resigned in his favour in 1503. 

In 1504, following confirmation of his election by Pope [[Julius II]], John took up office in the bishopric. On 28 January 1506 the bishop received agreement from the noble assembly (''St<U+00E4>ndeversammlung'') to his raising of the ''Landbede'', a tax. 

Through his attempts to expand the territory ruled by the [[bishopric]], he repeatedly clashed with the dukes of [[Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg]]. Internally, too, there were conflicts with the town of Hildesheim and the self-assured bishopric nobles (''Stiftsadel''). The [[diocese of Hildesheim]] ran increasingly into debt. 

John IV tried to consolidate prince-episcopal sovereignty into the [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim]] again. Within a few years he was able to save enough to take back the castles and property pledged to the bishopric nobles. However, the latter refused to pay the redemption fees. Not until 1518 was John given the necessary [[regalia]] (rights) by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]]. 

John IV was the central figure in the [[Hildesheim Stift Feud]]. Following his [[imperial ban]], Bishop John of Hildesheim sought asylum with the Prince-Elector [[Joachim I, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim]] of Brandenburg and hoped in vain to be reinstated. In summer 1527 he resigned from office and went, freed from his ban, to become a canon at [[Ratzeburg]] in the [[Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg|homonymous prince-bishopric]], where he died on 20 November 1547.
