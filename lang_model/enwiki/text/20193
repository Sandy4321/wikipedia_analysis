==Biography==
Richards started playing the [[xylophone]] at age six. He graduated from the [[The Hartt School|Julius Hartt School of Music]] (now part of the [[University of Hartford]]) and Hillard College. Even before then, he performed with the [[Hartford Symphony Orchestra]] and with various [[jazz]] artists in [[New England]]. After he left the military service, where he had been Assistant Band Leader of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry]] [[United States Army|Army]] Band in 1952 and 1953, his performing career rapidly gained momentum. In the 1950s and 1960s he played various percussion instruments with jazz ensembles first in [[New York City, New York|New York]] and then in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he settled permanently in 1959. He became known as one of the most desirable percussionists in [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and other popular music and was called on to play in countless [[movie]] and [[television]] soundtracks.

In 1954 Emil moved to New York where he played jazz gigs with [[Charles Mingus]], [[Ed Shaughnessy]] and [[Ed Thigpen]] while doing studio recordings for artists such as [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]] and Mitch Aires.  In 1955 Emil joined the [[George Shearing]] Quintet. He stayed with the group for over four years, playing 51 weeks a year. In 1959 he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he worked with the [[Paul Horn]] Quintet, [[Jimmy Witherspoon]], the [[Shorty Rogers]] Big Band, [[Don Ellis]], [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Lord Buckley]]. He also recorded with [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nelson Riddle]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Doris Day]]. In 1962, in response to a request from President [[John F. Kennedy]], Emil and a small jazz combo joined Sinatra on a tour around the world for the benefit of underprivileged children. This group helped to found the first hospital in [[Israel]] for [[Jew]]ish and [[Arab]] children. This was the beginning of Emil<U+2019>s interest in, and collection of ethnic percussion instruments.

After this world tour, Emil returned to Los Angeles where he recorded with such artists as the [[Beach Boys]], [[Jan and Dean]], [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Nat Cole]]. He became a member of [[Frank Zappa]]<U+2019>s [[Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra]] and recorded several albums with this large orchestra, including Zappa<U+2019>s first solo album, ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'', in 1967. He also worked on film scores for [[Jerry Goldsmith]], [[John Williams]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Elmer Bernstein]], [[Johnny Mandel]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Neal Hefti]], [[Lalo Schifrin]], [[Dave Grusin]], [[Michel Legrand]], [[Alex North]] and [[Bill Conti]], to name a few.

Richards soon became a "first call" percussionist for the [[Hollywood]] film industry, and has played for hundreds of films. He was involved in ''[[The Zodiac : Cosmic Sounds|The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds]]'' concept album and has played for many groups, including [[Doors|The Doors]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. He has served several terms on the Board of Directors for the [[Percussive Arts Society]], and donated the largest single-donor collection of instruments to the society museum.
