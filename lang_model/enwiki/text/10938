'''Tommy Solomon''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]] from the [[United States|American]] [[sitcom]]  ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. He was portrayed by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]].

==Ironic age==
When the Solomons originally arrived on [[Earth]], Tommy, despite being the oldest of the aliens, was given the body of a [[Adolescence|teenage]] boy. Despite having to act like a kid all the time, Tommy's real age shines through, particularly when he plays the role of mentor to High Commander [[Dick Solomon|Dick]], ostensibly Tommy's father while on Earth. During one episode, Tommy announces he has retired from the mission, and starts behaving like a stereotypical old man, even hanging out at the old folks' home (where he poses as one of the resident's nephews). As Information Officer, Tommy is the smartest and most Earth-savvy of the Solomons, and he is typically charged with gathering information about humans, mainly from [[television show]]s and [[film]]s. During the final season [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] left the series and became a recurring character, so in the storyline Tommy is sent to college.<ref name="BDOC">{{cite episode |title=B.D.O.C |episodelink=List of 3rd Rock from the Sun episodes#Season 6: 2000 - 2001 |series=3rd Rock from the Sun |serieslink=3rd Rock from the Sun|network=NBC |airdate=2000-12-12 |season=6 |number=7}}</ref>

==Alternate Universe==
In the Alternate Universe, Tommy is the star of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but later gets fired by Harry (as the President of NBC) for being too conceited and demanding a large salary.<ref name="DTM">{{cite episode |title=Dick'll Take Manhattan (Pt. 1)|episodelink=List of 3rd Rock from the Sun episodes#Season 6: 2000 - 2001 |series=3rd Rock from the Sun |serieslink=3rd Rock from the Sun|network=NBC |airdate=2000-11-21 |season=6 |number=4}}</ref>

==Running gag==
The major running gag of Tommy is that he is the "least" sexy of the alien colleagues, for [[Dick Solomon|Dick]] has charm, [[Sally Solomon|Sally]] has looks and [[Harry Solomon|Harry]] has an exotic sexual behavior. For example, in one episode, at the bar where Harry works later in the series, there was a machine that tests how sexy you are. When Tommy tries it out, he gets the lowest score, while Harry gets the highest.<ref name="WLGTDGTDWD">{{cite episode |title=What's Love Got to Do, Got to Do with Dick? |episodelink=List of 3rd Rock from the Sun episodes#Season 4: 1998 - 1999 |series=3rd Rock from the Sun |serieslink=3rd Rock from the Sun|network=NBC |airdate=1998-10-28 |season=4 |number=5}}</ref>

==Romantic life==
Tommy has had two main [[girlfriend]]s over the course of the show, [[August Leffler]] and [[Alissa Strudwick]]. He has a lot of difficulty maintaining a relationship with any girl, as he is often forced to come up with plausible explanations for his family's bizarre behavior. Therefore, much of his relationships seem to involve him begging his girlfriend to not leave him.<ref>{{cite news|title= A Not-so-secret Life |work= Chicago Tribune|date=|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-18/features/9905180315_1_alex-mack-3rd-rock-alissa|accessdate=2010-11-09}}</ref>

Tommy has had other [[love interest]]s, although typically ones that only last a single episode. Among the most notable were his glee club teacher, a [[goth subculture|goth]] student and even, on one occasion, [[Dr. Mary Albright]]<ref name="TDAM">{{cite episode |title=Tom, Dick and Mary |episodelink=List of 3rd Rock from the Sun episodes#Season 3: 1997 - 1998 |series=3rd Rock from the Sun |serieslink=3rd Rock from the Sun|network=NBC |airdate=1997-12-03 |season=3 |number=10}}</ref> and her sexually experienced niece.<ref name="DPTIIC">{{cite episode |title=Dick Puts the Id in Cupid |episodelink=List of 3rd Rock from the Sun episodes#Season 5: 1999 - 2000 |series=3rd Rock from the Sun |serieslink=3rd Rock from the Sun|network=NBC |airdate=2000-02-08 |season=5 |number=11}}</ref>
