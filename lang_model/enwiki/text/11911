'''Edmund "Ed" Jew''' ({{zh|s=<U+8D75><U+60A6><U+660E>|t=<U+8D99><U+60A6><U+660E>|p=Zh<U+00E0>o Yu<U+00E8>m<U+00ED>ng|j=ziu6 jyut6 ming4}}, born 1960 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]) is an incarcerated former [[Chinese American]] politician based in San Francisco. He graduated from [[San Francisco State University]] with a degree in [[economics]] and later earned a masters degree in [[Administration (business)|business administration]] at [[Golden Gate University]]. After spending several years as a businessman managing his family enterprises, he entered politics in 1980s and went on to serve in various community organizations. In 1996, he was the volunteer liaison for then [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors#District 4|District&nbsp;4]] supervisor [[Leland Yee]]. In 2002, Yee successfully ran for a seat in the [[California State Assembly|California Assembly]], and Jew ran for Yee's seat on the Board of Supervisors in the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors elections, 2002|2002 election]], but was defeated. When Yee's successor [[Fiona Ma]] in 2006 ran for state assembly, Jew again ran for supervisor in District&nbsp;4, which comprises most of the [[Sunset District, San Francisco, California|Sunset District]]. After winning a highly competitive election decided by [[instant-runoff voting]], he was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]].

Six months after taking office, the FBI raided his office and homes for allegedly extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] and later resigned in the face of extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pled guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64&nbsp;months in state prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.<ref name="sentencing">{{cite news | first = John | last = Cot<U+00E9>

==Personal life==
Edmund Jew was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. The Jew family emigrated from [[People's Republic of China|China]] around the turn of the century. His grandfather James Jew, who arrived to the city in 1913, established an employment agency in 1925 and later the Canton Flower Shop in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] in 1927. He had become a distinguished leader in the Chinese community after serving many local Chinese American associations.<ref name=bio>{{cite web | title = Biography | url = http://www.edjew.net/bio.htm | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070717082924/http://www.edjew.net/bio.htm | publisher = Ed Jew | archivedate = July 17, 2007 | accessdate = April 5, 2009}}</ref>

He was raised in Chinatown by his parents. When he was eight, he fell into a coma and had brain surgery as a result of being hit by a motorcycle.<ref name="sentencing"/> After graduating from [[San Francisco School of the Arts|McAteer High School]], Jew attended [[City College of San Francisco]] and [[San Francisco State University]], where he earned a degree in [[economics]]. In 1984, he also earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from [[Golden Gate University]].<ref name=bio/>

Before entering politics, Jew was an entrepreneur. Among other enterprises, he managed his family's flower shop and owned a local taxi company named Howard Mock Jew, Inc. In addition, he invested in real estate. He bought his first property in San Francisco at the age of 21 and, as of 2002, he had a real estate portfolio worth as much as $5&nbsp;million.<ref name=bio/> It was later revealed in news reports that beside owning several houses in the Bay Area, he also purchased properties in Arizona. In 2007, he transferred most of his properties to family members and his family trust due to his legal problems.<ref name=property>{{cite web | title = Ed Jew started property transfers as charges loomed | url = http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/ed-jew-started-property-transfers-charges-loomed | work = San Francisco Examiner | first = Joshua | last = Sabatini | date = April 17, 2008 | accessdate = December 9, 2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5urPpqwmL | archivedate = December 9, 2010}}</ref> 

Jew has a wife named Lorene and a daughter Cammie. They live in [[Burlingame, California]].<ref name=bio/><ref name="address"/> He also has a brother named David Jew.<ref name=property/>

==Political career==
Jew began his political career in the 1980s, setting up the Chinese Neighborhood Resource Center, which helped to clean up alleyways in Chinatown. He was then appointed by the mayor to serve on the Ten Year Plan Council to End Chronic Homelessness and the Office of Aging Advisory Council, the later oversaw the city's senior services. Like his grandfather, Jew was heavily involved in local Chinese Americans politics, serving as president of the Jew Family Benevolent Association, the Yeong Wo Benevolent Association, the Hay Sen Benevolent Association, the Hip Sen Benevolent Association, and the Lung Kong Benevolent Association. He was also an active participant of numerous other community organizations, namely the Northeast Community Federal Credit Union, the Chinese Holocaust Museum, the Sunset Residents Association, and the Sunset Parkside Education and Action Committee.<ref name=bio/> Jew once served as vice chairman of the San Francisc County Republican Central Committee before re-registering as an independent and then a Democrat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogarth|first=Paul|title=Daly Confirmed Winner; Ed Jew Wins in District 4 |url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=3899|work=BeyondChron|accessdate=December 9, 2010|date=November 10, 2006}}</ref><ref name="indicted"/>

From 1996 to 2001, Jew was then District 4 supervisor [[Leland Yee]]'s volunteer community liaison.<ref>{{cite web | first=Bonnie | last=Eslinger | title=Ed Jew: Associate may be source of probe | url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/ed-jew-associate-may-be-source-probe | work=San Francisco Examiner | publisher= | date=May 23, 2007 | accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> Jew first ran for Yee's District 4 seat in 2002 when Yee ran for the [[California State Assembly]].

==Controversies==
===FBI raid and extortion charges===
On May 18, 2007, six months after Jew took office as supervisor, agents from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), armed with a federal warrant, raided his office at [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]], his houses in San Francisco and Burlingame, and his Chinatown flower shop. In the raid, the FBI went through computers and records searching for evidence regarding what they termed "potentially criminal allegations."<ref name="Raid">{{cite news |author=Buchanan, Wyatt,  Selna, Robert & Vega, Cecilia M. | title = FBI questions S.F. supervisor, searches office | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/19/EDJEW.TMP | work =  San Francisco Chronicle | date =May 18, 2007 | accessdate = May 18, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaVlmCmp | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref>

Jew said that he had referred the owners of a chain [[bubble tea|tapioca drink]] shop, [[Quickly]], to a man named Robert Chan from land use consulting firm, Bridge Consulting, to resolve tea shop's permit issues. After several weeks, the owners paid $40,000 owed to Chan to Jew himself. Jew claimed that he turned over the money to the consultant and asked that half be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up to raise money for the renovation of a playground located at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street in San Francisco. The $10,000 donation, which was made to the group nearly a month after Jew received the money, was rejected by the group's fiscal agency after the FBI raid.<ref name="Raid"/><ref name="CBS5">{{cite web | title = Caught on Tape: FBI Raids SF Supervisors' Office | url = http://cbs5.com/topstories/local_story_138220449.html | publisher = CBS5 | date = May 18, 2007 | accessdate =May 19, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070521062915/http://cbs5.com/topstories/local_story_138220449.html | archivedate=May 21, 2007 }}</ref>

In June 2007, the Quickly owners told the press that it was Jew who first approached them about the permit issue and told them that he could help. Fearing that Jew's involvement was illegal, they contacted the FBI. They claimed that they never handed over their own money. Instead, the money was supplied by the FBI. In fact, a law enforcement official close to the investigation leaked that the FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew when he handed over the money.<ref>{{cite news |author=Matier, Phillip & Ross, Andrew.| title = FBI's cash paid Ed Jew, source says | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/10/MNGR0QC65G1.DTL | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 10, 2007 | accessdate =June 10, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaSpwR28 | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref>

On September 20, 2007, federal prosecutors charged Jew with one count of mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Elias| title =SF lawmaker charged with fraud | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-20-2025785561_x.htm| work =USA Today|agency=Associated Press | date =September 20, 2007 | accessdate =December 9, 2010}}</ref> Jew denied any wrongdoing and pled not guilty to mail fraud. His attorney, Steven Gruel, said the federal case was weak and questioned what influence Jew could have over the issuing of permits. He also said that Jew had no intention of resigning despite calls from Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] asking him to resign. If convicted of the fraud charge, Jew would have faced up to 20 years of imprisonment.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Wohlsen| title =SF supervisor pleads not guilty to fraud| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-21-2025785561_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press| date =September 21, 2007 | accessdate =December 9, 2010}}</ref> On November 7, 2007, a federal grand jury added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Gruel said that his client denied these allegations and would plead not guilty.<ref name="indicted">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Egelko| title =Supervisor Ed Jew hit with 5 new charges in federal indictment | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/07/MN3IT7BRN.DTL&ao=all | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =November 7, 2007 | accessdate =November 7, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaTDA7di | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref>

In December 2007, Gruel exited the case. It was later revealed that Gruel had a [[conflict of interest]] because he had previously been a federal prosecutor and a lawyer who had represented Jew's "political opponent," Leland Yee. Gruel refused to comment citing the [[Attorney-client privilege|attorney-client]] [[Duty of confidentiality|confidentiality]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Cheever| title =Jew seeks hearing in extortion case | url =http://www.fogcityjournal.com/news_in_brief/bcn_ed_jew_080220.shtml | work =Fog City Journal | date =February 20, 2008 | accessdate =February 20, 2008}}</ref>

===Residency requirements violation===
[[File:DennisHerreraEdJewLetter.JPG|thumb|alt=A screenshot of the letter|One of the letters sent by Herrera to Jew's defense attorney requesting the supervisor to provide more evidences regarding his residency]]
In late May 2007, following the FBI raid, questions surfaced about whether or not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position.<ref name="resident 1">{{cite news |author=Buchanan, Wyatt, Selna, Robert & Vega, Cecilia M. | title = S.F. supervisor is investigated over question of city residency | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/22/EDJEW.TMP | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =May 22, 2007 | accessdate =May 22, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaTNfb6L | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref> The house claimed as Jew's residence (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said that the house was vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity.

On June 12, 2007, San Francisco District Attorney [[Kamala Harris]] issued a warrant for the arrest of Ed Jew. The nine counts of felony charges included four counts of perjury, three counts of election code violations, voter fraud, and providing false documents.<ref name="charges">{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Sabatini | title = Jew's lawyer rips local probe as 'politically driven' | url =http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/jew039s-lawyer-rips-local-probe-039politically-driven039 | work = San Francisco Examiner | date =June 19, 2007 | accessdate =December 9, 2010}}</ref> Later that day, Jew turned himself in to the Burlingame Police Department with bail set at $135,000.

On June 18, 2007, City Attorney [[Dennis Herrera]] sought approval from then [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] to remove Ed Jew from office. Citing records that showed little use of utilities and interviews of 32 neighbors, he declared that the supervisor had violated the residency requirements of the City Charter.<ref>{{cite news |author=Buchanan, Wyatt & Lagos, Marisa. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/18/BAGFHQH9D88.DTL | title = City Attorney moves to remove Ed Jew from office | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 18, 2007 | accessdate =June 18, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaTpZSLp | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Vega|first=Cecilia M.|last2=Buchanan|first2=Wyatt|url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/19/MNG3IQHL9O1.DTL&ao=all | title =Rare move could force Ed Jew out| work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 19, 2007|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> Mayor Gavin Newsom said the case against Jew was "very damning" and urged the supervisor to explain himself. He also raised concern about Jew continuing to cast votes while the legitimacy of his residency was in question and said that he was reviewing city law to find out what power he had to remove Jew from office.<ref>{{cite news |first=Cecilia M.|last=Vega| url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/20/MNGSLQIDF51.DTL | title =Mayor to Ed Jew: 'Prove It' | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 20, 2007 | accessdate =June 20, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaU9dkoW | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref>

On July 4, 2007, Jew's attorneys issued a 138-page response to Herrera's petition arguing that even if Jew had not lived full time in his home in District 4, his election has not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of bias and of being politically motivated in bringing charges against Jew.<ref>{{cite news |author=Vega, Cecilia M. & Wildermuth, John. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/04/MNG42QQSU41.DTL&ao=all | title =Ed Jew's lawyers reply to charges | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 4, 2007 | accessdate =December 9, 2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaUHkqrE | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref> Herrera denied Jew's accusations, calling it a desperate act.

On July 17, 2007, Jew pled not guilty to the perjury charges. His attorney asked Superior Court Judge Harold Kahn to repeal his $135,000 bail saying that he was not a flight risk. He also waived his right for a speedy trial on behalf of Jew. Kahn agreed to void the bail after Jew agreed to surrender his passport.<ref>{{cite news |author=Buchanan, Wyatt & Vega, Cecilia M. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/17/MNG0OR1N5E1.DTL&ao=all| title =Ed Jew Surprises D.A., Pushes for Quick Trial | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 17, 2007 | accessdate =December 9, 2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaUQ7Sr9 | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref>

During the preliminary hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue apartment and spent most of his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] inspector also indicated that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address. Finally, prosecutors cited records including utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his home in 28th Avenue, as well as loan applications that indicate he lived in Burlingame. In defense, Jew's attorney presented a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco. He also questioned the possible bias in the testimonies of witnesses.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jaxon |last=Van Derbeken | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/31/BA5KR9UBR2.DTL | title =Witnesses, loan application undermine Ed Jew's claims | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 31, 2007 | accessdate =August 3, 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaUYOli3 | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref> On August 2, 2007, Kahn ruled there was sufficient evidence to compel Jew to stand trial.

In October, defense attorney Bill Fazio exited the case, citing "irreconcilable differences." In a written note, Jew agreed that he did not oppose Fazio's exit and that they have mutual consent.

In a letter, he noted that he resigned due to tremendous legal expenses and swore never to seek public office again in the best interest of his family. Chu became Jew's interim successor until the election in November 2008.<ref name="resignation"/>

=== Guilty plea and sentencing ===
On October 10, 2008, Jew pled guilty in federal court to the mail fraud and extortion charges, which has a maximum sentence of up to a decade.<ref name="guilty_a">{{cite news | last=Buchanan | first=Wyatt | title=Former S.F. supervisor pleads guilty to federal extortion, bribery, plans to accuse others | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/10/BARK13EVU2.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | publisher= | date=October 10, 2008 | accessdate=October 10, 2008 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uaV44cmZ | archivedate = November 28, 2010}}</ref> The following month, he changed his plea to guilty in response to the perjury charges regarding his residency violation after accepting a plea bargain that could spare him from serving more time than what he gets in the federal case.

On April 3, 2009, Jew was sentenced to 64 months in state prison and fined $10,000 for extortion. The sentence was longer than the one prosecutors had asked for; they had originally sought a 57-month prison term, saying that he "preyed upon and victimized the very people whom he had proposed to support in his campaign: small business owners in the Sunset District."<ref name="sentencing"/> On April 22, 2009, he was sentenced to one year in county jail, three years of probation, and a fine of $2,000.<ref name="sentencing2"/> Jew reported to a federal prison in [[Safford, Arizona]] on June 30 and his prison term began on July 1.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ross.
