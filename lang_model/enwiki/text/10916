'''Paul Chester Jerome Brickhill''' (20 December 1916 &ndash; 23 April 1991) was an [[Australian]] [[writer]], whose [[World War II]] books were turned into popular [[movies]].

He was born in [[Melbourne, Victoria]] and educated at [[North Sydney Boys High School]]. Afterwards, Brickhill worked as a [[journalist]].

During the war he joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]],  Brickhill undertook advanced training as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]], before being assigned to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]], a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] unit with the [[Desert Air Force]]. In 1943, Brickhill was shot down over [[Tunisia]] and became a [[prisoner of war]].

While imprisoned at [[Stalag Luft III]], in [[Germany]], Brickhill was involved in work towards the "[[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|Great Escape]]". He did not take part in tunnelling or the escape itself, due to [[claustrophobia]]. 

After the war, Brickhill wrote the first major account of the escape in ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]'' (1950), bringing the incident to a wide public attention. He went on to write two other best-selling war books: ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', the story of [[Operation Chastise]] and the destruction of dams in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]], and ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'', the story of Battle of Britain ace [[Douglas Bader]].
