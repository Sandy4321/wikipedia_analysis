The '''''Sea Cloud''''' is sailing cruise ship of the Sea Cloud Cruises line. Initially built as a private yacht, it subsequently served as a [[weather ship]] for the [[United States Coast Guard]] and [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. The ship served as the first racially integrated [[warship]] in the [[United States Armed Forces]] since the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web| last = Fagan| first = Kevin| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Carlton Skinner &ndash; broke racial barriers in Navy| work = | publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date = 29 August 2004| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F08%2F29%2FBAG858GD2T1.DTL&type=printable| format = | doi = | accessdate =  5 May 2009}}</ref> Following the war, ''Sea Cloud'' was returned to private ownership, serving as a yacht for numerous people, including as presidential yacht of the [[Dominican Republic]]. The ship currently sails in Europe and the Caribbean as part of a fleet of sail cruise ships operated by Sea Cloud Cruises GmbH of [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], often under contract to the [[National Geographic Society]].

==Private yacht==
''Sea Cloud'' was built in [[Kiel, Germany]], as a [[Barque]] for Marjorie Merriweather Post and her second husband Edward F. Hutton of Wall Street fame [[E. F. Hutton & Co.]].<ref name=USCG>{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = USS Sea Cloud, 1942: WPG-284; IX-99; ex-Hussar| work = | publisher = [[United States Coast Guard]]| date = 20 August 2008| url = http://www.uscg.mil/History/webcutters/Sea_Cloud_IX99.asp| format = | doi = | accessdate =  10 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Cloud - IMO 8843446  Sea Cloud, bt. 1931, gt. 2531 |url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=689469   |accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref> She was launched in 1931 as the '''''Hussar II'''''; at the time of her construction, she was the largest private yacht in the world.<ref name=cruises>{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = A Windjammer Writes History | work = | publisher = Sea Cloud Cruises| year = 2007| url = http://www.seacloud.com/en/the-ships/sea-cloud/history.html| doi = | accessdate =  11 May 2009}}</ref> In 1935, the United States Ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], married [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]].<ref name=cruises/> Mr. and Mrs. Davies renamed the ship ''Sea Cloud''.<ref name=USCG/> Although Mrs. Davies owned the ship, she allowed Mr. Davies to claim ownership of the vessel. As a man with political influence, Davies entertained many high profile people on the ship, including [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876<U+2013>1965)|Queen Elisabeth of Belgium]].<ref name=cruises/> The ship even served as an informal embassy, as Soviet and United States officials stayed and met on the vessel.<ref name=espanol>{{cite web| last = Figueiral| first = J.

==Coast Guard service==
Mrs. Davies had first offered the ship to the [[United States Department of the Navy|U.S. Department of the Navy]] in 1941, but the Navy turned her down. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] objected to the ship entering service, remarking that she was too beautiful to be sacrificed.<ref>{{cite book |title= 100 Best Cruise Vacations 4|last= Scull|first= Theodore|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006|publisher= Globe Pequot|location= |isbn= 0-7627-3862-6|pages= 112<U+2013>115|pages= 270|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ImCzXyYivkkC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> However, on January 7, 1942, the Navy reassessed their position, chartering the ship for $1 per year.<ref name=USCG/> The Navy sent ''Sea Cloud'' from [[Georgetown, South Carolina]], to the [[United States Coast Guard Yard]] in [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]], to be refitted as a "weather observation station vessel", and had its four masts removed and hull painted battleship gray.<ref name=USCG/><ref name=espanol/> The ''Sea Cloud'' was commissioned as a [[United States Coast Guard Cutter]] on April 4, 1942, and assigned to the [[Eastern Sea Frontier]], with a permanent [[home port]] in [[Boston]].<ref name=USCG/>

During 1942, ''Sea Cloud'' mostly served as a [[weather ship]] at Weather Patrol Station Number Two (position {{coord|52|0|N|42|30|W|display=inline}}). On June 6, 1942, the ship rescued eight survivors from the [[schooner]] ''Maria da Gloria''.<ref name=USCG/> On August 3, 1942 and August 4, 1942, the ''Sea Cloud'' served at Weather Patrol Station Number One while {{USS|Manhasset|AG-47|6}} was converted to a weather ship.<ref name=USCG/>

==Naval service==
In 1943, the Navy asked for control of ''Sea Cloud'' and ''Nourmahal'', another former yacht converted into a weather ship. On April 9, 1943, the [[United States Navy]] commissioned ''Sea Cloud'' as USS ''Sea Cloud'' (IX-99), though she maintained a Coast Guard crew.<ref name=USCG/> She was assigned to Task Force 24.

Relieving {{USCGC|Conifer|WLB-301|6}} in February 1944, ''Sea Cloud'' patrolled a one-hundred square mile area near the [[New England]] coast, generating weather reports for the [[United States Naval Districts#1st Naval District|First Naval District]]. On February 27, 1944, ''Sea Cloud'' travelled to be refurbished at [[Atlantic Yard]] in [[East Boston]], afterwards taking over a new one-hundred square mile area at Weather Station Number One.<ref name=USCG/>

On April 5, 1944, ''Sea Cloud'' received radar indication of a small target at position {{coord|39|27|N|62|30|W}}, bearing 350<U+00B0> at {{convert|3000|yards|m}}.<ref name=USCG/> [[General quarters]] were sounded and battle stations manned, but contact was lost ten minutes later. The target was identified as a [[submarine]], but after ''Sea Cloud'' carried out standard [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine drills]] with no evidence of damage being inflicted, she returned to port.<ref name=USCG/>

After minor repairs, ''Sea Cloud'' was rebased to [[Argentia, Newfoundland]], where she was assigned to Weather Station Number Three. While patrolling the area on June 11, 1944, the crew spotted a Navy [[TBF Avenger]], exchanging [[recognition signal]]s. ''Sea Cloud'' received orders to report to the {{USS|Croatan|CVE-25|2}} and join the five other escort ships under her command. The envoy searched for a raft reported in the area, but returned with no sightings. After this event, ''Sea Cloud'' was once again reassigned to Weather Station Number Four. After a search for a downed aircraft, she returned to port in Boston. ''Sea Cloud'' was decommissioned on November 4, 1944, at the [[Bethlehem Steel]] Atlantic Yard and returned to Davies, along with $175,000 for conversion to pre-war appearance.<ref name=USCG/>

For her wartime service, ''Sea Cloud'' was awarded the [[American Campaign Medal]] and the [[World War Two Victory Medal]].

===Racial integration===
In late 1944, [[Lieutenant]] [[Carlton Skinner]] took command of the ship, after previously serving as [[Executive officer#United States|executive officer]] in November 1944. At that time, black seamen were only permitted to serve as ship stewards. After witnessing a black man save the crew of the {{USCGC|Northland|WPG-49|2}} yet still be denied promotion because of the rule, Skinner proposed an experiment. Skinner submitted his plan to the [[U.S. Secretary of the Navy]] and was allowed to sail his first weather patrol with a [[racial integration|fully integrated crew]].<ref name=Skinner>{{cite web| last = Skinner| first = Carlton| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = USS Sea Cloud, IX 99, Racial Integration for Naval Efficiency| work = | publisher = [[United States Coast Guard]]| date = 13 November 2008| url = http://www.uscg.mil/History/articles/Carlton_Skinner.asp| format = | doi = | accessdate =  10 May 2009}}</ref> Within a few months, fifty black sailors, including two officers, were stationed aboard the ''Sea Cloud''.<ref name=USCG/> Skinner requested that the experiment not be publicized and the ship not be treated differently from other ships in the task force. Skinner showed that his integrated crew could work just as efficiently as a segregated crew, if not more so, when his crew passed two fleet inspections with no deficiencies.<ref name=USCG/>

Under Skinner's command when the ship was integrated, American painter [[Jacob Lawrence]] served on the Sea Cloud.<ref>[http://www.uscg.mil/history/FAQS/Jacob_Lawrence.html Jacob Lawrence, USCG biography]{{dead link|date=December 2014}}</ref> He was able to paint and sketch while in the Coast Guard,<ref>http://www.coastguardchannel.com/images/viewerCont/Stories/LawrencePaints_032309.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2014}}</ref> notably his ''War Series''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/AudioGuides?play_id=777 |title=AMERICAN LEGENDS: FROM CALDER TO O<U+2019>KEEFFE: AUDIO GUIDE STOP FOR JACOB LAWRENCE, WAR SERIES: BEACHHEAD, 1947 |publisher=[[Whitney Museum of Art]] |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Return to civilian service==
Following its return, ''Sea Cloud'' received a reassembled [[rigging]] in 1947, and a new set of twenty-nine sails in 1949.<ref name=Buckley/> She was painted white, and a gold eagle painted on the bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]] retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.<ref name=cruises/>

===Presidential yacht ''Angelita''===
[[Rafael Trujillo]], ruler of the [[Dominican Republic]], purchased ''Sea Cloud'' in 1955, trading a secondhand [[Vickers Viscount]] for it.<ref name=Buckley>{{cite book |title= Miles Gone By: A Literary Autobiography|last= Buckley|first= William F., Jr.|authorlink= William F. Buckley, Jr.|coauthors= |year= 2004|publisher= [[Regnery Publishing]]|location= [[Washington, D.C.]]|isbn= 0-89526-089-1|page= 482|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Bfgwlv1ZNmYC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> He renamed the ship ''Angelita'' after his daughter. The yacht served as a houseboat and government office. Following Trujillo's assassination on May 20, 1961, his family attempted to smuggle themselves and Trujillo's body to the [[Canary Islands]] aboard the ''Angelita'', but were forced back by the Dominican Republic's new government.<ref name=cruises/>

===School ship ''Patria''===
Five years after Trujillo's death, the ship, now named ''Patria'', was sold to Operation Sea Cruises. Company president John Blue renamed her ''Antarna''. He brought her to the United States, but port authorities docked the boat after a dispute. Charles and Stephanie Gallagher paid the fees to get the ship free and set her to sea, even though Blue still held the ship's papers. The two dreamed of making the ship an "oceanic school" where students would supplement their traditional learning with at-sea education. Blue eventually retrieved his ship after a confrontation in [[Panama]].<ref name=cruises/>

===Cruise ship ''Sea Cloud''===
After the ship stayed in port for eight years, Hartmut Paschberg and a group of [[Hamburg]] associates purchased her, once again naming her ''Sea Cloud''. Paschberg and thirty-eight other men sailed the ship to Europe, arriving in the [[Port of Hamburg]] on November 15, 1978. ''Sea Cloud'' spent eight months undergoing repairs in the now-named [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] shipyard, the very yard she was built in. She was redesigned with a sixty-four passenger capacity for a crew of sixty.<ref name=espanol/> The ship set sail on her first cruise in 1979,<ref name=cruises/> and has since been described by the ''Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising & Cruise Ships'' as "the most romantic sailing ship afloat".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.seasite.com/KnowledgeCenter/berlitz_guide/sailing_ships.aspx| author=Ward, Douglas |title=Sailing Ships.|publisher=[[Berlitz Corporation]] |year=2009 |work=Berlitz Complete Guide to Cruising & Cruise Ships | accessdate =  10 May 2009}}</ref>  In 2011, the ''Sea Cloud'' underwent extensive renovations at the MWB-Werft, [[Bremerhaven]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/deutschland/0,1518,752661,00.html| author=Blinda, Antje |title=Kreuzfahrt-Segler "Sea Cloud".
