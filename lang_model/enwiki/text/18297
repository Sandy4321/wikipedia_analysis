'''Aaron Cohen''' (born [[28 February]] [[1976]]) is a former [[Israel]]i Special Forces operative, [[California]]-based [[counterterrorism]] consultant and managing director of IMS Security.  Cohen was born in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], and educated at [[Beverly Hills High School]] as well as Robert Land Academy in Ontario, Canada.   

After high school, Cohen left Los Angeles for Israel, working on a [[kibbutz]] before enlisting in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].    After a grueling tryout process known as a <U+201C>gibush,<U+201D> Cohen was one of the few non-[[Sabra]]{{dn|date=April 2008}} volunteers accepted into the elite ranks of the Israeli Special Forces.  In the mid-1990s, he became a member of the secretive undercover Sayaret (commando) unit known as  [[Duvdevan]], ({{lang-he|<U+05D3><U+05D5><U+05D1><U+05D3><U+05D1><U+05DF>}}; lit. ''cherry'') a controversial counter-terrorist unit which runs missions targeting wanted terrorist suspects in the occupied territories of the West Bank, often while dressed as Palestinian Arabs.   

After his three-year service, Cohen returned to Los Angeles and launched IMS Security Consultants, Inc., a leading Hollywood VIP protection service which has done security work for movie stars such as [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Kate Moss]].  IMS has also been instrumental in offering Israeli-style counterterrorist and <U+201C>active shooter<U+201D> training to members of local, State and Federal law enforcement,  [[SWAT]] teams and the U.S. military.  As a terrorism expert, discussing matters such as the [[Virginia Tech gunman]] massacre, Cohen has appeared live on many news programs, including CNN, Fox News and Court TV.

Aaron Cohen<U+2019>s first book, ''Brotherhood of Warriors:  Behind Enemy Lines with a Commando in one of the World<U+2019>s Most Elite Counterterrorism Units,'' coauthored with journalist and best-selling author [[Douglas Century]] was published by Ecco / HarperCollins in April 2008.
