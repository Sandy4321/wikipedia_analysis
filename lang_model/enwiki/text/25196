'''[[Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi]]''' was convicted by a special [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]] of the bomb attack on [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (more commonly known as the [[Lockerbie]] bombing). On August 20, 2009, after Megrahi had served 8<U+00BD> years of the ensuing life sentence, he was released on "compassionate grounds" in accordance with Scottish law by Scotland's Justice Minister, [[Kenny MacAskill]]. MacAskill's decision attracted immense news coverage, along with furious anger from some quarters and praise from others.

==Decision to release==
Megrahi had developed [[prostate cancer]]. Dr Karol Sikora of the [[University of Buckingham]] examined Megrahi in prison early in July, and requested an "urgent" decision on returning him to Libya because "[w]e believe he has only a very short period of time to live". <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2526418.0.Cancer_expert_says_Megrahi_is_not_responding_to_treatment.php |title=Cancer expert says Megrahi is not responding to treatment |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=Newsquest (Herald & Times) Limited |date=2009-08-20}}</ref> MacAskill ordered his release under a 1993 Scottish statute enabling the release from prison of anyone deemed by competent medical authority to have three months or less to live.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6803849.ece?token=null&offset=84&page=8 |date=2009-08-20 |title=Lockerbie bomber released: Kenny MacAskill's full statement |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd}}</ref> MacAskill has said repeatedly that he bears sole responsibility for the decision.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/08/20/transcript.lockerbie.bomber/index.html |title=Transcript: Scotland official talks of Lockerbie release |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=2009-08-25 |date=2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/latestnews/Lockerbie-bomber-debate--live.5582360.jp |title=Lockerbie bomber debate - as it happened |work=Scotsman.com |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

===American reaction===
In the United States, whence 180 of the 270 victims came, the decision met with overwhelming hostility. Most families of the victims were "outraged and dismayed" by the decision, calling it "despicable," "ludicrous," "appalling," "heartbreaking," an "absolutely horrible decision," and "an absolutely disgusting disgrace."<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/08/20/scotland.lockerbie.bomber/index.html</ref><ref name="grauniad1" /><ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6061461/Lockerbie-bomber-Abdelbaset-Ali-Mohmed-Al-Megrahi-leaves-Scotland-bound-for-Libya.html</ref><ref name="grauniad2" /> Only one American relative offered public support for MacAskill's decision.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/08/20/lockerbie.bomber.reaction/index.html</ref> Polling taken the following week found that 82% of Americans opposed the decision, and 10% supported it.<ref>http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2009/82_oppose_decision_to_release_lockerbie_terrorist</ref>

The decision was called "absolutely wrong" by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]],<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/20/AR2009082000545.html?hpid=topnews</ref> and "an outrage" and a "caving in" by Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]].<ref name="grauniad1">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/20/lockerbie-scotland-usa-release</ref> President [[Barack Obama]] denounced the decision and Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] said that there was "no justification for releasing this convicted terrorist whose actions took the lives of 270 individuals."<ref name="grauniad2">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/20/lockerbie-bomber-release-libya-obama</ref> Senator [[John Kerry]], the former Democratic Presidential candidate, said that the decision <U+201C>turn[s] the word <U+2019>compassion<U+2019> on its head.<U+201D><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/europe/21lockerbie.html?hp=&pagewanted=print</ref> [[FBI]] director [[Robert Mueller]], who had been a lead investigator in the 1988 bombing, was "outraged at [the] decision, blithely defended on the grounds of 'compassion'" and called it "as inexplicable as it is detrimental to the cause of justice" in an open letter to MacAskill.<ref name = "mueller">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6073466/The-full-letter-from-the-FBI-Director-on-the-Lockerbie-bomber-release.html</ref> Independent Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] and Democratic Senator [[Ben Cardin]] called for an inquiry into the decision.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/6078767/US-senator-calls-for-investigation-into-Scotlands-decision-to-free-Lockerbie-bomber.html; http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.d104179820db91845f032fd0bf3f73ab.5b1&show_article=1</ref>

The ''[[New York Times]]'' opined that "for many Americans, his release rekindled the agony and anguish of loss and provoked questions about the notions of compassion and justice used by Scotland to justify its decision."<ref>http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/abdel_basset_ali_al_megrahi/index.html</ref> The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said that "MacAskill's self-praising paean to his own mercy ... mocked [the] victims" and was "feckless."<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/chi-0821edit1aug21,0,1138523.story</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that "MacAskill's blinkered interpretation of 'compassion' took no account of the enormity of Megrahi's crime or his refusal to acknowledge his guilt," and showed "no compassion for relatives of the 270 people killed when the jet exploded over Lockerbie."<ref>http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-ed-lockerbie21-2009aug21,0,1431516.story</ref>

===UK reaction===
Reaction in the UK has been more closely divided. In an [[opinion poll]] conducted by the ''Scottish Daily Mail'' and published on 27 August 2009, a 51% to 43% majority of Scots opposed the decision, although by a 57% to 35% margin respondents also felt MacAskill should not resign over the matter.<ref>http://www.yougov.co.uk/archives/pdf/Scottish%20Daily%20Mail_26-Aug-2009.pdf</ref> A poll commissioned by the [[The London Times|''Times'']] newspaper found that 61% of Britons thought that MacAskill had made the wrong decision, and 45% thought that the release had more to do with oil than Megrahi's terminal illness.<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6812859.ece</ref> A BBC/ICM poll found that 60% of Scots thought the Scottish Government was wrong to release Megrahi, although 56% said MacAskill should not resign.<ref name="bbcpoll" /> The poll also found that 74% of those polled believed that, "the affair had damaged Scotland's reputation."<ref name="bbcpoll">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8226585.stm Majority 'oppose' Megrahi release], [[BBC News]], 28 August 2009.</ref>  A Ipsos Mori poll of Scots published on 29 August 2009 showed a narrow plurality of 47% to 40% opposed to MacAskill's decision.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLS320509</ref>

[[Iain Gray]], the Scottish Labour leader, said that "The SNP's handling of this case has let down Scotland. Kenny MacAskill's conduct has damaged the Scottish Justice system and, in turn, Scotland's international reputation."<ref>http://www.publicservantscotland.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=10472</ref> Richard Baker, the shadow justice minister, said the decision was "an act of unpardonable folly" and called for MacAskill's resignation.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/scotland/6080538/Kenny-MacAskill-to-face-furious-MSPs-over-Lockerbie-bomber-release.html</ref> Former First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] said that MacAskill had "damaged Scotland in a way 'that will take years to recover." <ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/23/gordon-brown-letter-gaddafi-lockerbie</ref> Writing in the ''Telegraph'', former Scottish Office minister [[Brian Wilson (politician)|Brian Wilson]] wrote that the decision "shamed" Scotland, and co-opted an anti-war slogan to sum up his anger: "Not in our name, Mr MacAskill."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6069329/Lockerbie-bomber-The-SNP-cosying-up-to-Libya-has-shamed-my-nation.html |author=Brian Wilson |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2009-08-24 |title=Lockerbie bomber: The SNP's Libya stunt has shamed my nation }}</ref>

Others were more positive. Former Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]], who has long believed in Megrahi's innocence, said that MacAskill "had arrived at the right decision on compassionate grounds" and [[Richard Dalton (diplomat)|Richard Dalton]], a former British ambassador to Libya, said while he understood public anger about the release, "there are not good reasons why anybody convicted of that crime should be excepted from normal rules which apply for considering release on compassionate grounds."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8212285.stm], [[BBC News]].</ref> A representative of the [[Church of Scotland]] also supported the decision: Rev. [[Ian Galloway]], the convener of the [[Church and Society Council]], said that "justice is not lost in acting in mercy." The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow|Archbishop of Glasgow]], [[Mario Conti]], voiced his personal support for the decision, describing compassion as "one of the principles inscribed on the mace of the Scottish Parliament by which Scotland's government should operate".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8217891.stm FBI chief's attack 'out of order' - Conti], [[BBC News]], 24 August 2009.</ref> Former Labour First Minister [[Henry McLeish]] described FBI director Robert Mueller's attack on the decision as 'out of order' saying it was "an unfair slur on the Scots justice system".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8217891.stm FBI chief's attack 'out of order' - McLeish]</ref> Stating that Scottish jurisdiction over an attack on Americans was "accident[al]" British commentator [[David Aaronovitch]] responded to McLeish that saying the "decision was no business of Mr Mueller<U+2019>s is far more stupid and arrogant than anything the Americans have so far done or said concerning Lockerbie."<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article6808467.ece</ref>

John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi<U+2019>s appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear "this important evidence <U+2014> the six separate grounds for appeal that the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission|SCCRC]] felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there<U+2019>s been a miscarriage of justice."<ref>{{cite web | last = Mackey | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Lockerbie, the Unanswered Questions | work = News Blog | publisher = New York Times | date = 21 August 2009 | url = http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/lockerbie-the-unanswered-questions/| format = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> 

The British Government has so far declined to express an opinion on the decision,<ref name = "brown silence"/> but has denied that it gave succour to terrorists, and condemned the scenes at Tripoli airport<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8218060.stm Lockerbie move 'not terror boost'], [[BBC News]], 24 August 2009.</ref>. [[Alistair Darling]] pointed out that as a question of criminal justice, and thus a [[devolved matter]], it would be inappropriate for London to comment on it.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8212457.stm Cameron condemns Megrahi release], [[BBC News]], 20 August 2009.</ref> [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[David Cameron]] called the decision "the product of some completely nonsensical thinking,"<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iCpNccRWlg_qME4nocYStu9vB_pQ]</ref> ,and "wrong," stating; "I see no justice in affording mercy to someone who showed no mercy to his victims."<ref name="guardian828">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/aug/28/lockerbie-bomber-saif-gaddafi</ref> He has since written to Gordon Brown, calling on him to express an opinion.<ref name = "brown silence">[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/lockerbie/So-why-is-Brown-silent.5578577.jp So why is Brown silent on release of Megrahi?], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 22 August 2009.</ref>
