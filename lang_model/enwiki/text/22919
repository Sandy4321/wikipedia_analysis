'''Benjamin Franklin High School''' is a [[Magnet school|public magnet]] [[high school]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], USA.  Commonly nicknamed "Franklin" or "Ben Franklin", this school should not be confused with '''Franklin High School''' in [[Franklin, Louisiana]].  Ben Franklin was founded in 1957 as a school for [[Gifted education|gifted]] children. In 1990, it moved to its current location on the campus of the [[University of New Orleans]] (UNO) in the [[Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks, New Orleans|Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|Orleans Parish]], near [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. The school was damaged by several feet of flood water due to [[Hurricane Katrina]] in the fall of 2005, and efforts to reopen to school were covered by nationwide news agencies. Although the school is part of the [[New Orleans Public Schools|Orleans Parish School District]], it operates as a [[charter school]] under UNO.

Ben Franklin has a selective admissions process, and according to [[CBS News]] is a "magnet for the city's smart and motivated students."<ref name="CBSNews"/>  It has been named a [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon School]] three times by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], and was ranked 16 on the 2009 "America's Best High Schools" list by [[U.S. News & World Report]].<ref name="USNewsFeature2008">{{cite web |last=Calefati|first=Jessica| url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/high-schools/2008/12/04/the-high-school-that-beat-katrina.html |title=The High School That Beat Katrina |accessdate=2008-12-04|publisher=''U.S. News & World Report'' |date=2008-12-04}}</ref><ref name="USNews2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/high-schools/2008/12/04/best-high-schools-gold-medal-list.html |title=Best High Schools: Gold Medal List |accessdate=2010-02-26|publisher=''U.S. News & World Report'' |date=2008-12-04 | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5cy7rZkZu| archivedate=2008-12-10}}</ref> The class of 2008 produced 17 [[National Merit Scholarship Program#National Achievement Scholarship Program|National Achievement Semifinalists]], the most of any school in the [[United States]].<ref name="TimesPicayune2">{{cite web|url=http://blog.nola.com/living/2007/12/brain_gain_ben_franklin_no_1_i.html|title=Brain gain: Ben Franklin No. 1 in National Achievement semifinalists|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=2007-12-17|first=Maria|last=Montoya|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

Ben Franklin is a member of the [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association]] and offers a variety of sports programs.  Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. Because of its selective admissions policies, the school was accused in 1996 of an admissions bias against [[African American]]s. Notable alumni of the school include [[Wynton Marsalis]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning [[trumpeter]].
