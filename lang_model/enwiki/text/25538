'''Potato pancakes''' are shallow-fried [[pancake]]s of grated or ground [[potato]], [[flour]] and [[chicken egg|egg]], often flavored with grated [[onion]] or [[garlic]] and seasoning. Potato pancakes may be topped with a variety of [[condiments]], ranging from the savory (such as [[sour cream]] or [[cottage cheese]]) to the sweet (such as [[apple sauce]] or [[sugar]]), or they may be served ungarnished. Potato pancakes are sometimes made from mashed potatoes to produce pancake-shaped [[croquette]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-potatoes.com/mashed-potato-pancakes.html |title=Mashed potato pancake recipe |publisher=All-about-potatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>

==Background and history==
[[File:Potato pancakes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Belarus]]ian ''Draniki'' in a traditional crockery dish]]
Potato pancakes are commonly associated with traditional cuisines of [[Luxembourg cuisine|Luxembourg]] (''Gromperekichelcher''), [[Latvian cuisine|Latvia]] (as ''kartupe<U+013C>u pank<U+016B>kas''), [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuania]] (as ''bulviniai blynai''), [[Austrian cuisine|Austria]], [[Belarusian cuisine|Belarus]] (as ''draniki''), [[German cuisine|Germany]] (e. g. as ''Kartoffelpuffer''), [[Polish cuisine|Poland]] (as ''placki ziemniaczane''), [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]] (as ''deruny''), [[Ashkenazi cuisine|Ashkenazi Jewry]] (as ''latkes'' or ''latkas'' ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: <U+05DC><U+05D0><U+05B7><U+05D8><U+05E7><U+05E2><U+05E1>, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D1><U+05D4> ''levivah'', plural <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D1><U+05D5><U+05EA> ''levivot'')), [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]] (as ''t<U+00F3>csni'' and at least a dozen other names), [[Slovak cuisine|Slovakia]] (as ''n<U+00E1>le<U+010D>n<U+00ED>ky''), [[Iranian cuisine|Persia]] and the [[Czech cuisine|Czech Rep.]] (as ''brambor<U+00E1>k'' or ''cmunda''), although other cuisines have adopted similar dishes.  It is also the national dish of [[Belarus]]. In [[Cuisine of Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Cuisine of Belarus|Belarusian]] and [[Cuisine of Russia|Russian]] cuisines, potato pancakes are commonly known as ''deruny'' ({{lang-ua|<U+0434><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+043D><U+0438>}}) or ''draniki'' ({{lang-ru|<U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438>}}, {{lang-be|<U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0456><U+043A><U+0456>}}).  Throughout [[Germany]], potato pancakes are also very common under the names ''Reibekuchen'' or ''Kartoffelpuffer'', and they are eaten either salty (as a side dish) or sweet with apple sauce,<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120220012928/http://whatscookingdad.com/potato-pancakes/|archivedate=20120220|title=Potato pancakes recipe at "Whats Cooking Dad?" |publisher=Whatscookingdad.com |date=2009-01-06 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> blueberries, sugar and cinnamon; they are a very common menu item during outdoor markets and festivals in colder seasons; a traditional favorite in southern [[Indiana]] during holiday festivities.<ref name="Indiana">{{cite web | url=http://www.branchsmith.com/ebook/cnhi/29367_CNHI/index.html#/30/ | title=News Quiz: Special Holiday Edition | publisher=2011 ''Southern Indiana Current Magazine'' | accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref>

The [[R<U+00F6>sti]] from [[Swiss cuisine]] differs insofar as it never contains egg or flour.

In the North-East of England (particularly County Durham), there is a popular dish known as ''tattie fish''<!-- ORIGINAL SPELLING GIVEN WAS "TATY", BUT "TATTIE" IS A MORE COMMONLY GIVEN SPELLING OF THE UK SLANG TERM; BARRING ANY EVIDENCE THAT "TATY" IS USED AS WRITTEN SLANG I'VE CHANGED IT TO "TATTIE" -->- "tattie" being the local slang for potato, and "fish" because the pancake resembles a deep fried piece of fish.  The pancake consists of flour, eggs, shredded potatoes and onions.  Some people add tomato or cheese to the mix, depending on taste.

A form of potato pancake known as ''[[boxty]]'' is a popular traditional dish in most of [[Ireland]]. It is made in a similar way but using more starch.

The Swedish version of unbound potato pancakes is called ''r<U+00E5>rakor''.<ref name=chef2chef>{{cite web|url=http://recipes.chef2chef.net/recipe-archive/27/149328.shtml |title=Recipe for '&#39;r<U+00E5>rakor'&#39; on chef2chef.net |publisher=Recipes.chef2chef.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> When prepared with a batter of wheat flour, milk, egg, and shredded potatoes and fried like thin [[pancake]]s, they are called ''raggmunk'', the word "ragg" means crispy and "munk" derives from the Swedish "munkpanna", which is literally translated as donutpan.<ref name=wikipedia>[[:sv:Raggmunk]]</ref> Both kinds are enjoyed with fried pork and [[lingonberry]] jam.

The British also brought the potato pancake to Zimbabwe, Africa when Zimbabwe was a colony of Britain. They are still eaten today, where they are affordable.

Latkes need not necessarily be made from potatoes.  Numerous modern recipes call for the addition of ingredients such as onions and carrots.<ref>Rachel Ray, [http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/quick-potato-and-carrot-latkes-recipe/index.html Quick Potato and Carrot Latkes], [http://www.foodnetwork.com The Food Network], Dec. 20, 2008.</ref><ref>Philip and Karen Selwyn, [groups.google.com/group/rec.food.cuisine.jewish/msg/517874a7f50f71a1 Potato-carrot-onion Latkes], rec.food.cuisine.jewish archives, Oct. 11, 1998, 1:00 AM.</ref>

The largest potato pancake (possibly in the world) measuring 2 meters and 2 centimeters was made during the annual two-day celebrations of ''<U+015A>wit Plinzy'' (Plinza Dawn festival) in [[Rzechta]], Poland (''[http://rzechta.pl/wp-content/gallery/swieto-plinzy2009/104943_1248816490_6498_p.jpg see photo]'').

==Czech version==
Czech potato pancake is made of grated potatoes with egg, breadcrumbs or flour and seasoning (salt, pepper, most importantly garlic and [[marjoram]]; sometimes ground [[caraway]] seeds) and is served as it is. Some regional versions blend in dough, [[sauerkraut]], and/or sliced smoked meat. The same potato dough is used also as coating of fried pork chop called ''kaplick<U+00FD> <U+0159><U+00ED>zek''.

==Hanukkah tradition==
[[File:Latkes frying.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Frying latkes at home. [[Hannukah]]]]
Latkes ({{lang-yi|<U+05DC><U+05D0><U+05B7><U+05D8><U+05E7><U+05E2>}}) are traditionally eaten by [[Jews]] during the [[Hanukkah]] festival. The oil for cooking the latkes is symbolic of the oil from the Hanukkah story that kept the [[Second Temple]] of ancient [[Israel]] lit with a long-lasting flame that is celebrated as a miracle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjvoice.com/v7/7900food.html |title=The Philadelphia Jewish Voice |publisher=Pjvoice.com |date=2006-01-07 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> Prior to the introduction of the potato to the Old World, latkes were, and in some places still are, made from a variety of other vegetables, cheeses, legumes, or starches, depending on the available local ingredients and foodways of the various places where Jews lived.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Despite the popularity of latkes and tradition of eating them during Hanukkah, they are hard to come by in stores or restaurants in Israel, having been largely replaced by the [[Sufganiyah|Hanukkah doughnut]] due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jeffay, Nathan |title=Why Israel is a latke-free zone |url=http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/food/25127/why-israel-a-latke-free-zone |work=thejc.com |date=December 17, 2009 }}</ref>

The word "latke" itself is derived (via Yiddish) from the Russian/Ukrainian word <U+043B><U+0430><U+0442><U+043A><U+0430> meaning "patch." The word <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D1><U+05D4> ''leviva'', the Hebrew name for latke, has its origins in the [[Book of Samuel]]'s description of the story of [[Amnon]] and [[Absalom|Tamar]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by DLC |url=http://www.balashon.com/2006/12/leviva.html |title=Analysis of the word "latke" |publisher=Balashon |date=2006-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> Some interpreters have noted that the homonym <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05D1> ''levav'' means "heart," and the verbal form of l-v-v occurs in the [[Song of Songs]] as well.
