'''Emperor Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>''' (<U+79F0><U+5149><U+5929><U+7687> ''Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>-tenn<U+014D>'') (May 12, 1401 <U+2013> August 30, 1428) was the 101st [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] of [[Japan]], according to the traditional order of succession.<ref name="kunaicho">[[Imperial Household Agency]] (''Kunaich<U+014D>''): [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/ryobo/guide/101/index.html  <U+79F0><U+5149><U+5929><U+7687> (101)]; retrieved 2013-8-28.</ref>  His reign spanned the years from 1412 through 1428.<ref>[[Isaac Titsingh|Titsingh, Isaac]]. (1834). [http://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' pp. 327<U+2013>331].</ref>

==Genealogy==
His personal name was Mihito (iniitally written as <U+8EAC><U+4EC1>, and later written as <U+5B9F><U+4EC1>).
He was the eldest son of [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]].  His mother was Hinonishi Motoko (<U+65E5><U+91CE><U+897F><U+8CC7><U+5B50>), daughter of Hino Sukekuni (<U+65E5><U+91CE><U+8CC7><U+56FD>).  He had no children of his own, and was succeeded by his third cousin, [[Emperor Go-Hanazono]], great-grandson of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Pretender]] [[Emperor Suk<U+014D>]].

The name "''Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>''" (<U+79F0><U+5149>) was formed by taking one ''[[kanji]]'' from the names of the 48th and 49th imperial rulers [[Empress Koken|Empress Sh<U+014D>toku]] (<U+79F0><U+5FB3>) and [[Emperor K<U+014D>nin]] (<U+5149><U+4EC1>).

He reigned from October 5, 1412 until his death on August 30, 1428.  

Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D> became emperor upon the abdication of his father,  Go-Komatsu-''tenn<U+014D>'' in ''<U+014C>ei'' 18, in the 10th month (October 5, 1412).  His actual coronation date was two years later.<ref name="t327">Titsingh, p. 327.</ref>

The "retired" [[Go-Komatsu]] ruled as a [[cloistered rule|Cloistered Emperor]] during Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>'s reign.

At this point, Emperor Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D> is said to have acceded to the throne (<U+2018><U+2018>sokui<U+2019><U+2019>).<ref name="t330_v44"/>
* '''1418''' (''<U+014C>ei 25''): Ashikaga Yoshimochi ordered [[Asama Shrine]], at the base of [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Suruga province]], to be re-built.<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1962).  ''Studies in Shinto and Shrines,'' pp. 461<U+2013>462.</ref>

Those who follow its rigorous regime of practice abandon all relationships with women.  They are persuaded that by guarding their purity to focus attention, they can execute their magic arts with precision and success."</ref>

Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D> had no heirs of his own; and for this reason, [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]] selected Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>'s third cousin for Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D> to adopt as heir.  This cousin would accede to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] at age 10 as [[Emperor Go-Hanazono]] on September 7, 1428 (''Sh<U+014D>ch<U+014D> 1, 29th day of the 7th month'')<!-- NengoCalc <U+6B63><U+9577><U+4E00><U+5E74><U+516B><U+6708><U+4E8C><U+5341><U+65E5> -->: [[Emperor Go-Hanazono]] accedes to the throne at age 10.<ref>Titsingh, p. 331-332.</ref>

He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb at Fukakusa no kita no ''Misasagi'' (<U+6DF1><U+8349><U+5317><U+9675>) in [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]].

===Kugy<U+014D>===
''Kugy<U+014D>'' (<U+516C><U+537F>) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.  

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>'s reign, this apex of the ''[[Daij<U+014D>-kan]] included: 
* ''[[Sadaijin]]''
* ''[[Udaijin]]''
* ''[[Nadaijin]]''
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

==Eras of Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>'s reign==
The years of Sh<U+014D>k<U+014D>'s reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[neng<U+014D>]]''.<ref name="t327"/>
