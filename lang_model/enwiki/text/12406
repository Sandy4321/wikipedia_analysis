==History==

Great Budworth is a village that was formerly in the estate of [[Arley Hall]].  In the later part of the 19th&nbsp;century, its owner, [[Rowland Egerton-Warburton]], undertook a "campaign to restore the village and render it [[picturesque]] in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] eyes".<ref name=biog>{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard | title =The Work of John Douglas |edition= | publisher =[[The Victorian Society]] | year =1991 | location =London | pages = 92<U+2013>93| isbn =0-901657-16-6 }}</ref>  The George and Dragon was at that time a simple three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] inn.  In 1875 Egerton-Warburton commissioned the [[Chester]] architect [[John Douglas (architect)|John Douglas]] to undertake the restoration.  Douglas added tall rubbed chimneys, [[mullion]]ed windows and a steep pyramidal [[turret]].<ref name=biog/>

==Architecture==

The inn has three [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and is in two storeys.  It is built in brick with a [[roughcast]] [[stucco|rendering]] on the upper storey.  The roofs are [[hip roof|hipped]] and covered in clay tiles.  The central bay consists of a two-storey porch which projects forwards.  Its lower storey has an elliptical-headed doorway, and in the upper storey is a four-light mullioned window.  Each lateral bay has a four-light mullioned window in the lower storey and a three-light mullioned window in the upper storey.  A tall rubbed brick chimneystack rises from the left side of the roof.  Diagonally from the right corner is the inn sign.  The cut-out pictorial sign itself originated in [[Nuremberg]] while its ornate [[wrought iron]] bracket was made by the estate [[blacksmith]].  On each side of the porch is an oak post-and-rail fence inscribed with a number of sayings.  Above the inner door is a stone containing a verse written by Egerton-Warburton.  Internally, in the bar, is a stone inscribed in [[Latin]] and the date 1722.<ref name=images/>

==Present day==

The George and Dragon continues to trade as a public house and restaurant.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.onionring.co.uk/restaurants/restaurant_info.asp?RID=1536| title = George and Dragon| accessdate = 22&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = Onionring}}</ref>
