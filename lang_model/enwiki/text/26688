=== New China lobby ===
According to the [[United States Senate]] report ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns'', prior to 1995 the PRC's approach to promoting its interests in the United States was focused almost exclusively on diplomacy, including summits and meetings with high-level [[White House]] officials. In these meetings, Chinese officials often negotiated with the United States government by using the appeal of their huge commercial market.<ref name=chinalobby>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-2.htm ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, Minority Report'', Chapter 2], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref> 

United States companies were also known to lobby the U.S. government on various issues involving their companies and the PRC. In the 1990s, the news media reported on the phenomenon of U.S. companies lobbying for favorable trade policies regarding PRC and labeled this activity as the "[[China lobby|New China Lobby]]", which was contrasted with the "old" China Lobby that worked for the [[Republic of China]]. The group consisted of representatives of businesses with trade and investment interests in the PRC such as [[AT&T]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[Boeing]]. In addition, prominent Americans, including several former [[United States Secretary of State|United States Secretaries of State]], were reported to be involved in promoting increased economic relationships with the PRC, including [[Henry Kissinger]] as well as [[George Shultz]], [[Cyrus Vance]], [[Lawrence Eagleburger]], [[Alexander Haig]], and [[Brent Scowcroft]]. This "New China Lobby" urged United States officials to protect China's trade relationship with the United States because American exports to mainland China were rapidly increasing and creating new American jobs.<ref name=lobby>Weeks, Jennifer, [http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1997_06-07/weeks.asp "Sino-U.S. Nuclear Cooperation at a Crossroads"], Arms Control Association, June/July 1997, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref><ref name=chinatown>Judis, John B., [http://www.pacificnet.net/jue/chinanews/docs/chinatown.html "China Town"], ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[March 10]], [[1997]]</ref>

[[Image:USexportstoChina.png|thumb|left|250px|Growing economic ties between the United States and China are one factor influencing the diplomatic and political relationship between the two nations]]The U.S. Senate report about the 1996 fund-raising investigation noted that American exports to the PRC grew from $3 billion in 1980 to $38 billion in 1994.<ref name=usdollar>All currency figures are in [[United States dollar]]s.</ref> Between 1991 and 1996, United States exports to [[mainland China]] increased by 90.5 percent, and the United States designated the PRC as one of the top ten "Big Emerging Markets" offering the largest potential for United States goods in future years.<ref name=markets>Dryfuss, Robert, [http://www.prospect.org/print/V8/30/dreyfuss-r.html "The New China Lobby"], ''[[The American Prospect]]'', Vol. 8, Iss. 30, [[January 1|Jan. 1]], [[1997]] - [[February 1|Feb. 1]], [[1997]]</ref> Total trade between the two countries had risen from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $63.5 billion in 1996, making China the fourth largest U.S. trading partner at the time.<ref name=chinalobby>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-2.htm ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, Minority Report'', Chapter 2], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

Given the increase in trade, critics questioned whether China should still be seen as a geopolitical rival of the United States. One explanation, according to the Senate report, was the American public's negative attitude toward [[Human rights in China|China's human rights record]], still marked by the PRC government's suppression of democratic movements, such as the crackdown on anti-government protesters in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square in 1989]]. Another reason, from the PRC government's perspective, according to the report, was that "the coming to power of a China-bashing U.S. Congress [was] perceived as part of an increas[ed] anti-Chinese atmosphere in Washington." According to the Senate Committee, information discovered during its investigation supported the conclusion that the PRC government, beginning in 1994, was concerned that decisions by Congress, including [[One-China policy|its stance]] toward the [[issue of Taiwan]], would harm Chinese interests.<ref name=chinalobby>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-2.htm ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, Minority Report'', Chapter 2], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

=== Taiwan and nuclear designs ===
{{main|Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|Cox Report}}

In early 1995, President of the Republic of China [[Lee Teng-hui]] requested a visa to enter the United States to attend events associated with his graduate school reunion at [[Cornell University]] scheduled to be held in June 1995. By May of that year, Congress passed a resolution calling on President Clinton to grant a visa to President Lee. After the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] granted Lee's visa, the PRC government immediately protested the decision and, working through traditional diplomatic channels, suspended ongoing treaty negotiations and recalled its ambassador to the United States.<ref name=chinaprotest>Sciolino, Elaine, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614F9345C0C748DDDAF0894DD494D81&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Lee%20Teng-Hui "Angered Over Taiwan, China Recalls Its Ambassador in U.S."], ''New York Times'', [[June 17]], [[1995]]</ref> The PRC government considers Taiwan a rogue province of the country.

See [[Cox Report]] for more information.</ref> The [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) then began conducting a series of missile tests in the waters near Taiwan in July of that year.

=== China plan ===

After these crises, according to the Senate report, Chinese officials eventually developed a set of proposals to promote their interests with the United States government and to improve China's image with the American people. The proposals, dubbed the "China Plan", were prompted by the United States Congress's successful lobbying of the president to grant the visa to President Lee. United States Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]] had previously assured his Chinese counterpart [[Qian Qichen]] that granting a visa would be "inconsistent with [the United States'] unofficial relationship [with Taiwan]"<ref name=christopher>Ross, Robert S.,[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/GOV2880/ross3.pdf "The 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Confrontation: Coercion, Credibility, and Use of Force"], ''[[International Security]]'', 25:2, pp.87-123, Fall 2000, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]] (PDF file)</ref> and the Clinton Administration's acquiescence to the Congressional resolutions led the PRC to conclude that the influence of Congress over foreign policy was more significant than it had previously determined. When formulating the so-called plan, Chinese officials acknowledged that, compared to other countries, it had little knowledge of, or influence over, policy decisions made in Congress, which had a sizeable pro-Taiwan faction under the influence of a more established "China Lobby" run by the [[Kuomintang]].<ref name=chinalobby>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-2.htm ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, Minority Report'', Chapter 2], United States Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref> 

The plan, according the Senate report, instructed Chinese officials in the U.S. to improve their knowledge about members of Congress and increase contacts with its members, the public, and the media. The plan also suggested ways to lobby United States officials.<ref name=chinalobby>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-2.htm ''Investigation of Illegal or Improper Activities in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns, Minority Report'', Chapter 2], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

Over the years, the PRC repeatedly denied these lobbying efforts involved financial contributions of any kind:

{{cquote|[S]ome people and media in the United States speculated<U+2026> about so-called participation by Chinese individuals in political donations during the U.S. elections.

Though the ultimate level of participation or non-participation by the PRC government in the fund-raising schemes may never be fully known, investigations by the American media, the U.S. Justice Department, and the U.S. Congress, did prove there was a conspiracy by individuals to influence American elections with Asian funds prior to 1996.

== Major fund-raising figures and groups ==
==== Yah Lin "Charlie" Trie and Wang Jun ====
[[Image:potuswang.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Clinton with Wang Jun at the White House in 1996]]The most significant of the illegal foreign contributions was a $460,000 donation by [[Charlie Trie|Yah Lin "Charlie" Trie]] to President Bill Clinton's legal defense fund. The donation was made by delivery of an envelope containing $460,000 in $1,000 contributions, some on sequentially numbered money orders made out in different names but with the same handwriting.<ref name=trie>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/op080397.htm "The Exploits of Charlie Trie"], Editorial, ''Washington Post'', [[August 3|Aug. 3]], 1997</ref> 

Born in Taiwan, Trie emigrated to the U.S. in 1974. He eventually became an American citizen and co-owner of a restaurant in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] where he befriended then Governor Clinton. In addition to the donation to Clinton's defense fund, Trie and his immediate family donated $220,000 to the DNC which was later returned.<ref name=senate>[http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/3.pdf ''1997 Special Investigation in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns'': Section 3, pp. 11-14], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]] (PDF file)</ref>

Immediately after the donation to Clinton's defense fund, Trie sent a letter to President Clinton that expressed concern about America's intervention in tensions arising from China's military exercises being conducted near Taiwan. Trie told the President in his letter that war with China was a possibility should [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis#Runup to the 1996 election|U.S. intervention]] continue: 
{{cquote|...[O]nce the hard parties of the Chinese military incline to grasp U.S. involvement as foreign intervention, is [''sic''] U.S. ready to face such [a] challenge[?]...

After questions arose regarding Charlie Trie's fund-raising activities during Congressional investigations in late 1996, he left the country for the PRC.<ref name=senate>[http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/3.pdf 1997 Special Investigation in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns'': Section 3, pp. 11-14], U.S. Senate (PDF file)</ref> Trie returned to the U.S. in 1998 and was convicted and sentenced to three years probation and four months home detention for violating federal campaign finance laws by making political contributions in someone else's name and for causing a false statement to be made to the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC).<ref name=guiltyplea>[http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/05/21/trie/ "Fund-raiser Charlie Trie pleads guilty under plea agreement"], ''CNN.com'', [[May 21]], [[1999]]</ref>

Four days prior to Wang's White House visit, President Clinton granted Wang Jun's company Poly Technologies import permits that would allow the shipment of over 100,000 [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic weapons]] and millions of rounds of ammunition to a [[Detroit]] company (China Jiang An) that had ties to the Chinese military.

According to Wang, during a [[United Nations]] conference on women's rights in Beijing in 1995, he received an invitation from [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] to attend a reception, but his schedule was fully booked. Wang has also met with Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger (whom he calls "a good friend") in addition to former President [[George H. W. Bush]] after he left office. During his two-day visit to Washington in 1996, Wang also held talks with Bill Clinton's [[United States Commerce Department|Commerce Secretary]], [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]], whom he had met once before at a trade mission in [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=wangvisits>Mufson, Steven, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/campfin/stories/deny16.htm "Chinese Denies Seeking White House Visit"], ''Washington Post'', [[March 16]], [[1997]]</ref>

=== Ron Brown and Bernard Schwartz ===
[[Image:RonBrownUS.JPG|left|thumb|Commerce Secretary Ron Brown]]A close business associate of Ron Brown testified in court in 1998 that Brown had told her that Commerce Department trade missions were used for partisan political fund-raising at the behest of President Clinton and the First Lady.

A Commerce Department official reportedly threw away official government documents concerning the department's trade missions to China after a judge ordered they be turned over to [[Judicial Watch]], a [[American conservatism|conservative]] government watchdog group. According to the court: "No adequate explanation has been given as to why these documents were destroyed."<ref name=memoopinion>[http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/95cv133.pdf Memorandum Opinion Judicial Watch vs. Department of Commerce, page 14], [[U.S. District Court]] for the [[District of Columbia]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]] (PDF file)</ref>

Some of the trade missions to Asia were attended by [[Bernard L. Schwartz|Bernard Schwartz]], then CEO of [[Loral Space and Communications]] (an American maker of [[satellite]]s).

Col. [[Liu Chaoying]], then an executive at China Aerospace Holdings (China's main satellite company) and daughter of former General [[Liu Huaqing]]. 

Between 1994 and 1996, Chung donated $366,000 to the DNC. Eventually, all of the money was returned. Chung told federal investigators that $35,000 of the money he donated came from Liu Chaoying and, in turn, China's military intelligence.<ref name=chung>Jackson, David and Sun, Lena H., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/liu052498.htm "Liu's Deals With Chung: An Intercontinental Puzzle"], ''Washington Post'', [[May 24]], [[1998]]</ref>

Specifically, Chung testified under oath to the U.S. House Committee investigating the issue in May 1999 that he was introduced to Chinese Gen. [[Ji Shengde]],<ref name=retreat>Gen.

=== John Huang and James Riady ===
[[Image:Clinton-riady-huang.jpg|thumb|left|255px|John Huang (center) with Bill Clinton, James Riady (right), and Clinton aide [[Mark Middleton]] (with back to camera) in the [[Oval Office]]]][[John Huang]] (pronounced "Hw<U+00E4>[ng]"), was another major figure convicted. Born in 1945 in [[Nanping]], [[Fujian]], Huang and his father fled to Taiwan at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] before he eventually emigrated to the United States in 1969. A former employee of the Indonesian company [[Lippo Group]]'s [[Lippo Bank]] and its owners [[Mochtar Riady]] and his son [[James Riady|James]] (whom Huang first met along with Bill Clinton at a financial seminar in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1980), Huang became a key fund-raiser within the DNC in 1995. While there, he raised $3.4 million for the party. Nearly half had to be returned when questions arose regarding their source during later investigations by Congress.<ref name=riady>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/players/huang.htm "Campaign Finance Key Player: John Huang"], ''Washington Post'', [[July 27]], [[1997]]</ref>

According to [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] logs, Huang visited the White House 78 times while working as a DNC fund-raiser.<ref name=timeline>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/gen/resources/infocus/fundraising.flap/time9610.html "The Democratic Fund-Raising Flap: Timeline"], ''CNN.com'', [[July 1]], [[1997]]</ref> James Riady visited the White House 20 times (including 6 personal visits to President Clinton).<ref name=visits>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/gen/resources/infocus/fundraising.flap/characters.html "The Democratic Fund-Raising Flap: Cast of Characters"], ''CNN.com'', [[July 1]], [[1997]]</ref>

Immediately prior to joining the DNC, Huang worked in President Clinton's Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic affairs. His position made him responsible for Asia-U.S. trade matters. He was appointed to the position by President Clinton in December 1993. His position at the Commerce Department gave him access to classified intelligence on China. While at the department, it was later learned, Huang met 9 times with Chinese embassy officials in Washington D.C. The reasons for the meetings were never learned.<ref name=highlights>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/25/cox.report.highlights/ "Highlights of U.S. report on alleged China spying"], ''CNN.com'', [[May 25]], [[1999]]</ref>

Some DNC records suggested Huang started fund-raising before he left his government job which would have been a violation of the U.S. law known as the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]], though no charges regarding this issue were ever brought.<ref name=riady>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/players/huang.htm "Campaign Finance Key Player: John Huang"], ''Washington Post'', [[July 27]], [[1997]]</ref> Huang eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to reimburse Lippo Group employees' campaign contributions with corporate or foreign funds.<ref name=huangfelon>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/12/huang.sentence/ "Former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang pleads guilty"], ''CNN.com'', [[August 12|Aug. 12]], [[1999]]</ref> James Riady was later convicted of campaign finance violations relating to the same scheme as well.

According to the Justice Department some of those "mistakes" included reimbursing contributions made by Huang and various employees of Lippo Bank with funds wired from a foreign Lippo Group entity into an account maintained by John Huang at a bank in Hong Kong. Shortly after Riady pledged $1 million in support of then-Governor Clinton's campaign for the presidency, contributions made by Huang were reimbursed with funds wired from a foreign Lippo Group entity into an account Riady maintained at Lippo Bank and then distributed to Huang in cash. Also, contributions made by Lippo Group entities operating in the United States were reimbursed with [[wire transfer]]s from foreign Lippo Group entities.<ref name=justice1>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2001/January/017crm.htm "James Riady Pleads Guilty"], Department of Justice, press release, [[January 11|Jan. 11]], [[2001]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

An unclassified [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs]] report issued in 1998 stated that both James Riady and his father Mochtar had "had a long-term relationship with a Chinese intelligence agency." According to a story by journalist Bob Woodward, "the report was drawn from highly classified intelligence information supplied by both the CIA and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) that was not revealed during several months of public committee hearings the [previous] year."<ref name=riady1>Woodward, Bob, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf021098.htm "Findings Link Clinton Allies to Chinese Intelligence"], ''Washington Post'', [[February 10|Feb. 10]], [[1998]]</ref>

The most well-known of John Huang's fund-raisers involved Vice President [[Al Gore]], [[Maria Hsia]], and the [[Hsi Lai Temple|Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple]] in California.

=== Maria Hsia and the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple ===
[[Image:gore-hsia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vice President [[Al Gore]] with Venerable Master [[Hsing Yun]] ([[Fo Guang Shan]]'s Founder) Maria Hsia (left of Master Hsing Yun), [[Ted Sioeng]] (right), and John Huang (2nd from right in background)]]A close business associate of John Huang and James Riady since 1988, Taiwan-born Maria Hsia (pronounced "shy<U+00E4>") began her association with Al Gore the same year as well. The association began after Hsia sent the then-senator a letter inviting him to come visit Taiwan: "If you decide to join this trip, I will persuade all my colleagues in the future to play a leader [''sic''] role in your presidential race..."<ref name=hsia>Suro, Roberto, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf022398.htm "Gore's Ties to Hsia Cast Shadow on 2000 Race"], ''Washington Post'', [[February 23|Feb. 23]], [[1998]]</ref>

Gore went, and the two began an eight-year relationship. Gore said his dealings with Hsia were strictly business in nature, but, at least at one point, Gore sent a letter to Hsia and Howard Hom (a business partner of Hsia) referring to them as "special friends" for support during a serious injury of Gore's son, Albert.<ref name=hsia>Suro, Roberto, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf022398.htm "Gore's Ties to Hsia Cast Shadow on 2000 Race"], ''Washington Post'', [[February 23|Feb. 23]], [[1998]]</ref>

Regardless, their relationship came to an end when she was charged with money-laundering in early 1998. The Justice Department alleged Hsia facilitated $100,000 in illegal contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign through her efforts at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in California. Hsia was eventually convicted by a jury in March 2000.<ref name=hsiaconviction>Eskenazi, Michael, [http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/03/03/gore3_3.a.tm/index.html "For both Gore and GOP, a guilty verdict to watch"], ''CNN.com'', [[March 3]], [[2000]]</ref> The Democratic National Committee eventually returned the money donated by the Temple's monks and nuns. Twelve nuns and employees of the Temple refused to answer questions by pleading the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] when they were [[subpoena]]ed to testify before Congress.<ref name=witnesses>Abse, Nathan, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/fifth060998.htm "A Look at the 94 Who Aren't Talking"], ''Washington Post'', [[June 9]], [[1998]]</ref> Vice President Gore said he had no idea the Temple meeting was financial in nature: 

{{cquote|I did not know that it was a fund-raiser. But I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake <U+2014> Vice President Al Gore on [[NBC]] TV's ''[[The Today Show|Today]]'' show, [[January 24|Jan. 24]], [[1997]].<ref name=goremistake>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/01/24/gore.fundraiser/ "Gore Admits Temple Fund-Raiser Was A 'Mistake'"], ''CNN.com'', [[January 24|Jan. 24]], [[1997]]</ref>}}

[[Image:Lightmatter Hsi Lai Temple 2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Hsi Lai Temple in [[Hacienda Heights, California]]]]In response, the U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that investigated the controversy said:
{{cquote|The Vice President's staff... knew that the Temple event was a fundraiser. In March 1996, Deputy Chief of Staff David Strauss had helped arrange a meeting in the White House with the head of the Temple, Master Hsing Yun <U+2013> a meeting which Strauss believed would 'lead to a lot of $.' The White House staff repeatedly referred to the event as a 'fundraiser' in internal correspondence, and assigned to it a 'ticket price' of '1000-5000 [dollars per] head'.<ref name=hsia1>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/execsumm030698.htm "Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Majority Report Executive Summary"], ''Washington Post'', [[March 8]], [[1998]]</ref>}}

Additionally, a memo written by John Huang to Vice President Gore's assistant Kimberly Tilley specifically mentioned the Temple meeting was a fund-raising event.<ref name=memo>Huang, John, [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/09/03/gore.docs/documents/huang.memo.gif "Memo for Kim Tilley"], [[April 11]], [[1996]]</ref> It is illegal for religious organizations to hold political fund-raising events in the U.S. due to their tax-exempt status.

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also said they learned that Hsia had served as an "agent" of the PRC government.<ref name=hsia1>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/execsumm030698.htm "Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Majority Report Executive Summary"], ''Washington Post'', [[March 8]], [[1998]]</ref> Hsia denied the claim.

=== Ted Sioeng ===
Another notable figure involved in the affair was Ted Sioeng (pictured above with Vice President Gore) who illegally donated money to both Democrats and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Sioeng, who could not speak English, found himself invited to sit side-by-side with President Clinton or Vice President Gore at three different fund-raising events.<ref name=sioeng>[http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/18.pdf ''China Connection: Summary of Committee's Findings Relating to Efforts of PRC to Influence U.S. Policies and Elections'', page 9], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]] (PDF file)</ref> According to the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, $200,000 of the $400,000 that Sioeng and his family gave to Democrats was "funded by transfer from overseas accounts." All the money was eventually returned.

Also, from their report:
{{cquote|[I]n late July 1997... [t]he Committee learned that Chinese government officials... were aware of, and possibly encouraged, [Ted] Sioeng's purchase of a Los Angeles-based newspaper... in 1995 and succeeded in having the paper report from a pro-Beijing perspective. There was also information suggesting that Sioeng met with Chinese officials in 1995 and 1996.}}

[[Image:MFong.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Matt Fong]]Furthermore,
{{cquote|Sioeng also may have been involved in directing or funding contributions to American political entities and campaigns. The public information obtained by the Committee suggests that Sioeng personally directed contributions to Republican California officials in 1995. According to public information, Sioeng was involved in these contributions, but the source of the contributions is difficult to determine. The non-public information suggests that approximately half of the just over $100,000 used for these contributions may have come from unknown sources in China. According to public information, one of the officials, Republican California State Treasurer, [[Matt Fong]], has returned the $100,000 he received from Sioeng.<ref name=senate3>[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1998_rpt/sgo-sir/4-7.htm ''1997 Special Investigation in Connection with 1996 Federal Election Campaigns (Minority Report)'': Volume 4, part 1.7], U.S. Senate, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>}}

Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the directors of the FBI, CIA and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) told members of the Senate committee they had credible intelligence information indicating Sioeng acted on behalf of China.<ref name=chinaagent>Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf091297b.htm "Senate Panel Is Briefed on China Probe Figure"], ''Washington Post'', [[September 12|Sept. 12]],[[1997]]</ref>

== Department of Justice investigation ==
[[Image:Janet Reno-us-Portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|Attorney General Janet Reno]]The Justice Department opened a task force in late 1996 to begin investigating allegations of campaign fund-raising abuses by the Clinton/Gore re-election campaign. It expanded its internal investigation to include activities related to President Bill Clinton's legal defense fund in December 1997.<ref name=defense>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/9612/19/justice.expand/ "Justice To Expand Inquiry To Clinton's Legal Fund"], ''CNN.com'', [[December 19|Dec. 19]], [[1997]]</ref> 

President Clinton announced in February 1997 that he thought there should be a "vigorous" and "thorough" investigation into reports that the People's Republic of China tried to direct financial contributions from overseas sources to the Democratic National Committee. The president stopped short of calling for an independent prosecutor, saying that was the decision of the Justice Department.

"[O]bviously it would be a very serious matter for the United States if any country were to attempt to funnel funds to one of our parties for any reason whatever," President Clinton said.<ref name=serious>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/02/13/chinese.money/ "Clinton Wants Probe Of Possible Chinese Involvement"], ''CNN.com'', [[February 13|Feb. 13]], [[1997]]</ref>

By July 1997, the administration determined that no evidence of any such thing had yet been proven.

"We have received the relevant [FBI] briefings," [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Mike McCurry]] said. "We believe there's no basis for any change in our policy toward China, which is one of engagement."<ref name=congressconcerns>Harris, John F., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf072097.htm "White House Unswayed By China Allegations"], ''Washington Post'', [[July 20]], [[1997]]</ref>

"I do not know whether it is true or not," President Clinton stated. "Therefore, since I don't know, it can't... and shouldn't affect the larger long-term strategic interests of the American people in our foreign policy."<ref name=congressconcerns>Harris, John F., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf072097.htm "White House Unswayed By China Allegations"], ''Washington Post'', [[July 20]], [[1997]]</ref>

Members of Congress of both parties reached opposite conclusions. According to the ''Washington Post'': "Sen[ator] [[Fred Dalton Thompson|Fred D. Thompson]] (a Republican from [[Tennessee]]), chairman of the committee investigating allegations of illegal 1996 campaign fund-raising, has said he believes the Chinese plan targeted presidential and congressional elections. [While Democratic Senators [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph]]] [[Joe Lieberman|Lieberman]] and [John] Glenn sa[id] they believe the evidence show[ed] the Chinese targeted only congressional elections."<ref name=congressconcerns>Harris, John F., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf072097.htm "White House Unswayed By China Allegations"], ''Washington Post'', [[July 20]], [[1997]]</ref>

=== Calls for an independent counsel ===
[[Image:Louisfreeh.jpeg|thumb|120px|FBI Director Louis Freeh]]President Clinton's FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]] wrote in a 22-page memorandum to then Attorney General Janet Reno in November 1997 that "It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|independent counsel]]."<ref name=freeh>Lewis, Neil A.,  "Freeh Says Reno Clearly Misread Prosecutor Law", ''New York Times'', [[June 16]], [[1998]]</ref>

In July 1998, the Justice Department's campaign finance task force head, [[Charles La Bella]], sent a report to Janet Reno also recommending she seek an independent counsel to investigate alleged fund-raising abuses by Democratic party officials.<ref name=labella>Thomas, Pierre, [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/23/labella/ "Reno Aide Recommends Independent Campaign Finance Probe"], ''CNN.com'', [[July 23]], [[1998]]</ref> The media reported that LaBella believed there was clearly an appearance of a conflict of interest by Reno.<ref name=lehrer>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/july-dec98/reno_8-4a.html Politics and Prosecution Discussion], [[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]], transcript, ''[[PBS]]'', [[August 4|Aug. 4]], [[1998]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref> In his report to Reno he wrote: " [A] pattern [of events] suggests a level of knowledge within the White House&mdash;including the President's and First Lady's offices&mdash;concerning the injection of foreign funds into the reelection effort."<ref name=labellanote>La Bella, Charles,[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/documents/Labella_index.html La Bella Memo], Introduction, page 51, [[July 16]], [[1998]], Retrieved: [[April 19]], [[2006]]</ref> Additionally, La Bella stated: "If these allegations involved anyone other than the president, vice president, senior White House or DNC and Clinton-Gore '96 officials, an appropriate investigation would have commenced months ago without hesitation."<ref name=labellanote1>La Bella, Charles, [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/documents/Labella_index.html La Bella Memo], Introduction, page 14, [[July 16]], [[1998]], Retrieved: [[April 19]], [[2006]]</ref>

[[Robert Conrad, Jr.]], who later became head of the task force, called on Reno in Spring 2000 to appoint an independent counsel to look into the fund-raising practices of Vice President Gore.<ref name=lehrer1>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june00/gore_6-23.html Fund-raising Investigation Discussion], NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, transcript, ''PBS'', [[June 23]], [[2000]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

Janet Reno rejected all of these requests:
{{cquote|I try to do one thing: what's right. I am trying to follow the independent counsel statute as it has been framed by Congress. If you had a lower threshold, then any time somebody said 'boo' about a covered person, you'd trigger the independent counsel statute <U+2014> Janet Reno, [[December 4]], [[1997]].<ref name=reno>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/12/04/reno.briefing/ "Reno Defends Independent Counsel Decision"], ''CNN.com'', [[December 4]], [[1997]]</ref>}}

Six weeks after this statement, Attorney General Reno agreed to [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]] independent counsel [[Kenneth Starr]]'s request to look into allegations that President Clinton had committed [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] relating to the [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit brought against him by [[Paula Jones]] (a former Arkansas state employee during Clinton's governorship there).<ref name=jones>Baker, Peter, et al., [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/clinton012198.htm "Clinton Accused of Urging Aide to Lie"], ''Washington Post'', [[January 21|Jan. 21]], [[1998]]</ref>

Critics such as columnists [[Charles Krauthammer]] and [[Morton Kondracke]], as well as a number of FBI agents, suggested that the investigations into the improper fund-raising allegations were impeded as part of a [[cover-up]].<ref name=critic>Krauthammer, Charles, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/op101097.htm "Reno's Humiliation"] (Opinion), ''Washington Post'', [[October 10|Oct. 10]], [[1997]]</ref><ref name=critic1>Kondracke, Morton, [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/kondracke080999.asp "GOP must launch new probe of Chinagate"] (Opinion), ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', [[August 9|Aug. 9]], [[1999]]</ref><ref name=critic2>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/index/finance/ncfin359.htm "FBI agents criticize Justice Department"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', [[July 22|Sept. 22]], [[1999]]</ref>

=== Notable convictions ===
The task force created to investigate campaign fund-raising irregularities during the 1996 U.S. elections secured criminal convictions against 17 people by 2001. 

In addition to the convictions against John Huang, Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie, Maria Hsia, and James Riady (who was fined $8.6 million &ndash; the largest fine ever levied against an individual), Clinton friend [[Ernest Green]], a former member of the [[Little Rock Nine]], pleaded guilty in 2001 to failure to declare and pay taxes on $30,000 in income which he received in 1995 from Charlie Trie for a planned business venture between the two.

[[Image:T000317.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Senator Robert Torricelli (Democrat-[[New Jersey]])]]Donors to former Democratic Senator [[Robert Torricelli]] (a member of the Senate Government Affairs Committee during the time its investigations took place) were particularly affected by the criminal investigations. David Chang, a member of the 1996 Torricelli Campaign Finance Committee, pled guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign. Chang also pled guilty to witness tampering in connection with the campaign financing task force investigation. Chang's co-defendant, Audrey Yu, pled guilty to obstruction of justice under the same superseding indictment. Lawrence Penna, the former president of a now-defunct New Jersey securities firm, was charged with violating election laws by funneling illegal campaign contributions to the 1996 federal election campaigns of both President Clinton and Senator Torricelli. Cha-Kuek Koo, a New Jersey businessman, pled guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to the Torricelli campaign. Koo admitted to assisting David Chang in making conduit contributions using Koo's employees at [[LG Group]]. Berek Don, a former Republican party leader in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], pleaded guilty to another conduit contribution scheme to the Senator's campaign. Carmine Alampi, a Bergen County New Jersey attorney, pleaded guilty to the same scheme.<ref name=justice>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2001/December/01_crm_662.htm Ernest G.

Senator Torricelli announced on [[October 1]], [[2002]] he would not stand for re-election as a result of the controversy.<ref name=nj>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/elec02.nj.s.torricelli.race/ "Torricelli drops out of N.J. race"], ''CNN.com'', [[October 1|Oct. 1]], 2002</ref>

The Justice Department did not bring criminal charges against the Democratic National Committee, but in 2002 the Federal Election Commission fined the DNC $115,000 for its role in illegal fund-raising during the 1996 U.S. election campaigns. The FEC's [[general counsel]] recommended more severe penalties, but the three Democratic election commissioners on the committee blocked the recommendation on a 3-3 tie vote.<ref name=fecfines>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/23/elec02.fec.dnc/ "DNC fined for illegal 1996 fund raising"], ''CNN.com'', [[September 23|Sept. 23]], [[2002]]</ref>

== Congressional investigations ==
=== Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs ===
[[Image:Fred Thompson.jpg|thumb|100px|Senator Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.)]]On [[July 8]] [[1997]], the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs began its public hearings into the campaign finance scandal. Chairman [[Fred Dalton Thompson|Fred Thompson]] suspended the public hearings on [[October 31]] [[1997]]. The Committee's final report was released to the public on [[March 5]] [[1998]].

Opening statements of public hearings from Senate Committee Chairman Senator Fred Thompson:
{{cquote|I would like to turn our attention to one of the most troublesome areas of this investigation. I speak of allegations concerning a plan... by the Chinese government and designed to pour illegal money into American political campaigns. The plan had a goal: to buy access and influence in furtherance of Chinese government interests... The committee believes that... Chinese government officials crafted a plan to increase China's influence over the U.S. political process. The committee has identified specific steps taken in furtherance of the plan. Implementation of the plan has been handled by Chinese government officials and individuals enlisted to assist in the effort... Our investigation suggests that the plan continues today. Although most discussions of the plan focuses on Congress, our investigation suggests it affected the 1996 presidential race and state elections as well. The government of China is believed to have allocated substantial sums of money to achieve its objectives. Another aspect of the plan is remarkable because it shows that the PRC is interested in developing long-term relationships with... up and coming government... officials at state and local levels. The intent is to establish relations that can be cultivated as the officials rise through the ranks to higher office.<ref name=opening>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/campaign/july97/hearing_7-8.html NewsHour with Jim Lehrer], transcript, ''PBS'', [[July 8]], [[1997]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>}}

[[Image:Glenn.gif|thumb|100px|right|Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio)]]Opening comments from the Committee's Minority Leader, Senator [[John Glenn]] (a Democrat from [[Ohio]]):
{{cquote|According to the press the Chinese government intended to use a relatively modest amount of money to gain influence in the Washington [[lobbying]] game, and it intended to do this by focusing on the legislative branch of government. Now, I mention these reports here because I am greatly concerned about how the reports are sometimes discussed by individuals in this body and in the press. I've heard language like infiltration, foreign [[espionage|spies]], foreigners, as we're jeopardizing our [[national security]]. Well, on this issue the committee should go just as far as the facts take us, recognizing that it's the FBI that's in a much better position to do an espionage investigation. Now, let's be careful, however, not to jump to conclusions that [[treason]] has been committed based on a partial story with ambiguous information. But wherever the trail leads let's look at it.<ref name=opening>[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/campaign/july97/hearing_7-8.html NewsHour with Jim Lehrer], transcript, ''PBS'', [[July 8]], [[1997]], Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>}}

=== House Government Reform and Oversight Committee ===
[[Image:Burton_Dan.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Representative [[Dan Burton]] (R-[[Indiana|Ind.]])]]A [[United States House of Representatives]] investigation, headed by Republican [[Dan Burton]], also focused on allegations of campaign finance abuse, including the contributions channeled through Chung, Huang, Trie, et al. 

The investigation was lengthy, spanning both the 105th and 106th Congresses, and according to a Democratic report had cost over $7.4 million as of [[August 31]] [[1998]], making it the most expensive Congressional investigation ever (the Senate [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] investigation cost $7 million in 1998 dollars).<ref name=cost>[http://www.democrats.reform.house.gov/Documents/20050124115157-73108.pdf ''Cost of Congressional Campaign Finance Investigations to the U.S. Taxpayer, Minority Report'': page 8], U.S. House of Representatives, Retrieved: [[April 14]], [[2006]]</ref>

The investigation itself was controversial, attracting criticism from partisans and moderates. Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] said in May 1998, "Barring some dramatic change, I think the Burton investigation is going to be remembered as a case study in how not to do a congressional investigation and as a prime example of investigation as farce."<ref name=partisian>Lacey, Marc, [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/29150984.html?dids=29150984:29150984&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=May+2,+1998&author=MARC+LACEY&pub=Los+Angeles&edition=&startpage=14&desc=NEWS+ANALYSIS "House Probe of Campaign Fund-Raising Uncovers Little, Piles Up Partisan Ill Will"], ''Los Angeles Times'', [[May 2]], [[1998]]</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial characterized the committee's investigation as a "travesty" and a "parody".<ref name=nyeditorial>Editorial, ''New York Times'', [[March 20]], [[1997]]</ref> A ''Washington Post'' editorial called the House investigation "its own cartoon, a joke, and a deserved embarrassment".<ref name=posteditorial>Editorial, ''Washington Post'', [[April 12]], [[1997]]</ref> 

Investigators, however, complained the investigation took so long due to the unprecedented lack of co-operation of witnesses. Ninety-four people either refused to be questioned, pled the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], or left the country altogether.<ref name=witnesses>Abse, Nathan, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/fifth060998.htm "A Look at the 94 Who Aren't Talking"], ''Washington Post'', [[June 9]], [[1998]]</ref>
