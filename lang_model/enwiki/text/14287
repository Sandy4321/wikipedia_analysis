Nylink was founded in 1973 as the SUNY/OCLC Network, providing access and support to OCLC<U+2019>s core services ([[Cataloging#Cataloging_rules|cataloging]] and resource sharing) for New York State libraries.  Nylink is one of fifteen regional service providers (RSPs) for [[OCLC]], developed to provide personalized support for a suite of OCLC services <ref>http://www.oclc.org/contacts/regional/default.htm OCLC's Regional Service provider list and map</ref>.  In April 1999, the SUNY/OCLC Network changed its name to Nylink to reflect  its more diverse membership and services. <ref>http://www.enyacrl.org/winter99.html#changename ENY-ARCL Press Release regarding Nylink's New Name</ref>

*2006: Nylink and eleven other OCLC networks joined together to form the Network Education Exchange (NEE) [http://www.amigos.org/?q=nee].  Through this agreement, Nylink members can take training classes at any other OCLC network at member rates.

==Resource sharing across New York==
LAND [http://nylink.org/delivery/], a statewide ground delivery service for transporting materials between participating libraries, was created and is administered by Nylink.  For a flat annual rate, LAND participants can send and receive an unlimited number of items. 

In January 2004, Nylink began working with [[State University of New York at Geneseo|SUNY Geneseo]] <ref>http://illiad.lib.geneseo.edu/ids/index.asp IDS Website</ref> to support the Information Delivery Service (IDS) pilot program.   The IDS Project is a cooperative resource sharing system designed to implement and evaluate a set of common transaction objectives, policies, and procedures among participating libraries that will help optimize mutual access to the information resources contained within those libraries.  The foundation of the project is based upon each participating library meeting the performance standards outlined in the IDS Project contract, using the OCLC ILLiad Resource Sharing Management System and the LAND Delivery System.  IDS has gained attention nationwide through the ATLAS ILLiad conferences. 

In June 2007, members of New York<U+2019>s library community came together in [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]] to discuss and share ideas regarding the future of resource sharing in New York State.   New York [[Interlibrary loan|Resource Sharing Summit]]: Moving Ahead <ref>[http://nylink.org/sharing/nyrss/default.cfm Nylink - Resource Sharing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> provided a forum for librarians to come together to discuss resource sharing issues.  An outcome of the summit was the creation of two working groups to look at discovery and delivery model to benefit New York's library community.
*Discovery Working Group
*Delivery Working Group
