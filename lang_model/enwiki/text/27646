'''Operation Teardrop''' was a [[United States Navy]] operation of [[World War II]] conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German [[U-boat]]s that were believed to be approaching the [[East Coast of the United States|United States east coast]] armed with [[V-1 flying bomb]]s. Two large U.S.&nbsp;Navy [[anti-submarine warfare]] task forces succeeded in destroying five of the boats, for the loss of one destroyer escort. After the war the Allies determined that the submarines were not carrying missiles.

Operation Teardrop was planned during late 1944 in response to [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] reports which indicated that Germany was preparing a force of missile-armed submarines. The plan was executed in April 1945 after several [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX submarines]] put to sea from Norway bound for the the United States. While severe weather conditions in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] greatly reduced the effectiveness of the four U.S. Navy [[escort carrier]]s involved, long patrol lines of [[destroyer escort]]s successfully detected and engaged most of the German submarines. Four of the submarines engaged were sunk with the loss of their entire crew. Most of the crew of the other submarine to be sunk were captured, with the specialists among the prisoners being brutally interrogated. In exchange, {{USS|Frederick C. Davis|DE-136|6}} was sunk with the loss of most of her crew. The surviving U-boats surrendered to the U.S. Navy in early May as part of the general German surrender.

==Background==
In late 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] received intelligence reports which suggested that the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] was planning to use {{nowrap|V-1 flying bombs}} launched from submarines to attack cities on the east coast of the United States. In September that year, [[Oscar Mantel]], a spy captured by the U.S. Navy when the submarine transporting him to [[Maine]] was sunk, told his [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] interrogators that several missile-equipped U-boats were being readied. [[United States Tenth Fleet]] analysts subsequently examined photos of unusual mountings on U-boats at bases in Norway, but concluded that they were wooden tracks used to load torpedoes. Further rumors of missile-armed submarines emerged later that year, including one from Sweden passed on by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]]. The British [[Admiralty]] discounted these reports, and assessed that while V-1s could be potentially mounted on Type IX submarines, the Germans were unlikely to devote scarce resources to such a project.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 213<U+2013>215</ref>
[[File:Duxford UK Feb2005 V1flyingbomb.JPG|thumb|250px|left|alt=A grey rocket on a camouflaged ramp in front of a hedge. The tops of houses and street lights are visible behind the hedge.|A V-1 on a launch rail at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]]]]

Despite the Tenth&nbsp;Fleet and Admiralty assessments, the U.S. military and government remained concerned that Germany would conduct vengeance attacks against east coast cities. In early November&nbsp;1944, the [[Eastern Sea Frontier]] mounted an intensive search for submarines within {{convert|250|mi|km}} of New York City.<ref name="Siegel_33">Siegel (1989), p. 33</ref> In early December&nbsp;1944 the spies [[William Colepaugh|William Curtis Colepaugh]] and [[Eric Gimpel]], who had been captured in New York City after being landed by [[German submarine U-1230|''U-1230'']] in Maine, told their interrogators that Germany was preparing a group of rocket-equipped submarines. On December&nbsp;10 the [[Mayor of New York City]], [[Fiorello H. La Guardia|Fiorello La Guardia]], publicly warned that Germany was considering an attack on New York with long-ranged rockets. La Guardia's warning and the claims made by the captured spies received considerable media coverage.<ref name="Lundeberg_215">Lundeberg (1994), p. 215</ref> Despite this, the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], which was dominated by the [[United States Army|Army]], advised President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on December&nbsp;11 that the threat of missile attack was so low that it did not justify the diversion of resources from other tasks. This assessment was not supported by the U.S. Navy.<ref name="Siegel_33" />

In response to the perceived threat, the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|United States Atlantic Fleet]] prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders and missiles. This plan was originally code-named 'Operation Bumblebee', and later renamed 'Operation Teardrop'. Completed on January&nbsp;6, 1945, the plan involved U.S.&nbsp;Navy anti-submarine forces as well as [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) and [[United States Army]] units, which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft and missiles. The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces to operate in the mid-Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast. These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups, and used [[Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Argentia, Newfoundland]] as their forward operating base. As well as guarding against missile attacks, these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high-performance [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI submarines]] if they began operating in the central Atlantic. The Atlantic&nbsp;Fleet's commander, Vice Admiral [[Jonas H. Ingram]], gave a press conference on January&nbsp;8 in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 215<U+2013>216</ref>

In January&nbsp;1945, German Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Albert Speer]] made a [[propaganda]] broadcast in which he claimed that V-1 and V-2s "would fall on New York by February&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1945", increasing the U.S. Government's concern over the threat of attack.<ref name="Blair_683">Blair (1998), p. 683</ref> However, the Germans had no ability to fire missiles from their submarines, as both attempts to develop submarine-launched rockets ended in failure. In June&nbsp;1942, [[German submarine U-511|''U-511'']] was used to trial small and short-ranged artillery rockets which could be fired while submerged. Development of this system ended in early 1943, as it was found to decrease the U-boats' seaworthiness.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 213<U+2013>214</ref> The German military also began the development of a U-boat-towed launch canister for the [[V-2]] ballistic missile in November 1944. Once complete, these canisters were to be towed to a position off the U.S. east coast and be used to attack New York. Vulkan Docks in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] was contracted to build a prototype in March or April 1945 but little work took place before Germany's final collapse. It is unlikely that the system would have been successful if it had been completed.<ref name="Neufeld_255">Neufeld (1995), p. 255</ref>

===Initial deployments===
[[File:USS Croatan USN photo.jpg|thumb|alt=A World War II-era aircraft carrier at anchor. Several aircraft are on her flight deck and land and buildings are visible in the background.|USS ''Croatan'' anchored in the [[Hudson River]] off New York City in October 1945]]
Nine Type IX U-boats were dispatched from Norway to patrol off Canada and the United States in March&nbsp;1945. On April&nbsp;12, [[German submarine U-518|''U-518'']], [[German submarine U-546|''U-546'']], [[German submarine U-805|''U-805'']], [[German submarine U-858|''U-858'']], [[German submarine U-880|''U-880'']], [[German submarine U-881|''U-881'']] and [[German submarine U-1235|''U-1235'']] were designated "[[Wolf pack Seewolf|Gruppe Seewolf]]" and ordered to attack shipping from New York southwards. The remaining two boats, [[German submarine U-530|''U-530'']] and [[German submarine U-548|''U-548'']], were directed to Canadian waters.<ref>Blair (1998), pp. 686<U+2013>687</ref> The purpose of this deployment was to "annoy and defy the United States".<ref name="Morison_345">Morison (1956), p. 345</ref>

The Allies were aware of this force's departure and destination through information gathered from [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] decrypts. Vice Admiral Ingram and the U.S.&nbsp;Tenth Fleet concluded that the boats in Gruppe Seewolf were carrying V-1s and launched Operation Teardrop in response.<ref name="Blair_686">Blair (1998), p. 686</ref> The ships of the First Barrier Force, which comprised escort carriers {{USS|Mission Bay|CVE-59|6}} and {{USS|Croatan|CVE-25|6}} and twenty destroyer escorts, sortied from [[Hampton Roads]] between March&nbsp;25 and 27, proceeded to Argentia to refuel and assembled east of [[Cape Race]] on April&nbsp;11. Twelve of the destroyer escorts deployed into a line {{convert|120|mi|km}} long while the two carriers, each protected by four destroyer escorts, sailed to the west of the line. The carriers' air operations were, however, greatly hindered by heavy seas.<ref name="Lundeberg_216"> Lundeberg (1994), p. 216</ref> The rough weather also forced the cancellation of planned memorial services for President Roosevelt after his death on April&nbsp;12.<ref name="Morison_346">Morison (1956), p. 346</ref>

As it sailed west, Gruppe Seewolf was ordered to attack shipping by [[Befehlshaber der U-Boote|U-boat Command]]. The boats found no targets, however, as the Allies had routed convoys to the south to avoid the submarines and severe weather.<ref name="Blair_686" /> The German submarines began to reach their initial stations east of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] on April&nbsp;8. U-Boat Command assigned Gruppe Seewolf a dozen different scouting lines between April&nbsp;2 and 19. The radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by the Allies, providing them with accurate information on where the boats were operating.<ref name="Lundeberg_217">Lundeberg (1994), p. 217</ref>

===First Barrier Force actions===
Just before midnight on April&nbsp;15, {{USS|Stanton|DE-247|6}} made radar contact with ''U-1235'' at a position about {{convert|500|mi|km}} north of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]]. She immediately attacked the submarine with her [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] anti-submarine mortar, but missed as the submarine submerged. Assisted by {{USS|Frost|DE-144|6}}, ''Stanton'' quickly gained sonar contact with the submarine and made three more hedgehog attacks. The third attack, which was conducted at 0033 on April 16, sank the submarine with the loss of her entire crew. Shortly afterwards ''Frost'' detected ''U-880'' by radar as she attempted to flee the area on the surface. After illuminating the submarine with [[star shell]] and spotlights, the destroyer escort opened fire on her with [[Bofors 40 mm]] guns from a range of {{convert|650|yd|m}} at 0209. ''U-880'' quickly submerged but was tracked by ''Stanton''<U+2019>s and ''Frost''<U+2019>s sonar operators. The two American ships made several hedgehog attacks on the submarine, with ''Stanton'' sinking her with no survivors at 0404.<ref name="Lundeberg_218">Lundeberg (1994), p. 218</ref> Both submarines suffered huge explosions after being struck by hedgehog projectiles. This further raised the fear that they were carrying rockets and motivated the First Barrier Force to intensify its efforts to destroy the remaining U-boats.<ref name="Morison_349">Morison (1956), p. 349</ref>

The First Barrier Force maneuvered south westward following the destruction of ''U-1235'' and ''U-880''. [[Leigh light]]-equipped [[B-24 Liberator]]s from [[VP-26|VPB-114]] spotted ''U-805'' on the surface during the nights of April&nbsp;18 and 19. The submarine was only {{convert|50|mi|km}} from ''Mission Bay'' and her escorts, but was not attacked as the aircraft couldn't confirm whether she was hostile before she submerged. On the night of April&nbsp;20, ''U-546'' attempted to torpedo a U.S. destroyer escort, but missed. The following night ''U-805'' was detected by {{USS|Mosley|DE-321|6}}, but escaped after being depth charged by ''Mosley'', {{USS|Lowe|DE-325|6}} and {{USS|J.R.Y. Blakely|DE-140|6}} for two hours.<ref name="Lundeberg_219">Lundeberg (1994), p. 219</ref>

The First Barrier Force scored its final success on the night of April&nbsp;21/22. Just before midnight {{USS|Carter|DE-112|6}} detected ''U-518'' with sonar. {{USS|Neal A. Scott|DE-769|6}} joined her and made the initial hedgehog attack on the submarine. Following this ''Carter'' made her own hedgehog run, which sank ''U-518'' with no survivors.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 219<U+2013>220</ref> By this time the First Barrier Force was returning to Argentia, after the Second Barrier Force relieved it.<ref name="Lundeberg_220">Lundeberg (1994), p. 220</ref>

===Second Barrier Force actions===
The Second Barrier Force comprised escort carriers {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}} and {{USS|Core|CVE-13|6}} and twenty two destroyer escorts. ''Bogue'' and ten destroyer escorts had sailed from [[Quonset Point|Quonset]] on April&nbsp;16, while ''Core'' and twelve destroyer escorts sailed from [[Bermuda]] and other locations.<ref name="Morison_350">Morison (1956), p. 350</ref> The force was initially stationed along the [[45th meridian west|45th meridian]] in a patrol line {{convert|105|mi|km}} long, and sailed towards the east.<ref name="Lundeberg_220" /> This line was made up of 14 destroyer escorts sailing at {{convert|5|mi|km}} intervals, with ''Core'' and her four escorts at its northern end and ''Bogue'' and her four escorts at the southern end.<ref name="Morison_350" />

On the night of April&nbsp;22/23, U-boat Command dissolved Gruppe Seewolf and directed the three surviving boats to take up stations between New York and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. Shortly afterwards, [[German submarine U-881|''U-881'']], [[German submarine U-889|''U-889'']] and [[German submarine U-1229|''U-1229'']], which had been operating separately, were also ordered to positions between New York and [[Cape Hatteras]]. Radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by Allied code breakers and increased fears that the submarines were trying to attack American cities.<ref name="Lundeberg_220" />

The Second Barrier Force encountered its first U-boat on April&nbsp;23 when a [[TBF Avenger]] from [[VC-19]] sighted ''U-881'' about {{convert|74|mi|km}} north west of ''Bogue'' just after noon. The aircraft dropped depth charges, but did not seriously damage the submarine. This was the first attack made by an aircraft during Operation Teardrop.<ref name="Morison_351">Morison (1956), p. 351</ref> The next day ''U-546'' sighted ''Core'' and maneuvered to attack the escort carrier.<ref name="Blair_687">Blair (1998), p. 687</ref> She attempted to pass through the barrier line but was detected by USS ''Frederick C. Davis'' at 0830, which immediately prepared to attack the submarine. After realizing that his boat had been detected ''U-546''<U+2019>s commander, Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Paul Just, fired a [[G7es torpedo|T-5 acoustic torpedo]] at the destroyer escort from a range of {{convert|650|yd|m}}. ''Frederick C. Davis''<U+2019> [[foxer]] decoy was not effective, and the torpedo struck her forward engine room at 0835. She sank five minutes later with the loss of all but 66 of her 192 crewmen.<ref name="Morison_351" /><ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> Eight American destroyer escorts subsequently hunted ''U-546'' [[USS_Neunzer_(DE-150)#Battling_German_Submarine_U-546|for almost ten hours]] before {{USS|Flaherty|DE-135|6}} severely damaged her with a hedgehog salvo. The submarine immediately surfaced, but sank after ''Flaherty'' and three or four other destroyer escorts fired at it. Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Just and 32 other crewmen survived the sinking and were taken prisoner.<ref name="Blair_687" />
[[File:Capt Just USS Bogue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bearded man wearing a white jumper walking towards the camera along a narrow walkway while holding on a railing. Water is visible below the walkway and a large number of men wearing dark clothes are either passing in the opposite way or watching the bearded man.|Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Just comes aboard USS ''Bogue'' after being rescued]]

Some of ''U-546''<U+2019>s survivors were harshly treated in an attempt to force them to divulge whether the submarines bound for the U.S. east coast were carrying missiles. After brief interviews on board ''Bogue'', the survivors were transferred to the U.S. base at Argentia. Upon arrival on April&nbsp;27 the prisoners were screened for interrogation, with eight specialists being separated from the other 25 survivors, who were then sent to [[prisoner of war]] camps. The specialists were held in solitary confinement and subjected to "shock interrogation" techniques, exhausting physical exercise and beatings. On April&nbsp;30, Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Just provided brief information on Gruppe Seewolf's composition and mission following a second interview in which he collapsed unconscious. The information provided by Just and the other specialists did not mention whether the submarines were equipped with missiles. The eight men were transferred to [[Fort Hunt, Virginia]] shortly after [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], where they continued to be harshly treated until Just agreed to write an account of ''U-546''<U+2019>s history on May&nbsp;12.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 224<U+2013>225</ref> Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of ''U-546''<U+2019>s survivors was a "singular atrocity" motivated by the interrogators' need to promptly extract information on potential missile attacks.<ref name="Blair_687" />

The Second Barrier Force slowly moved south west from April&nbsp;24, searching for the remaining U-boats. {{USS|Swenning|DE-394|6}} made radar contact with a submarine on the night of April&nbsp;24, but it escaped during the resulting search. After a week of searching south of the Newfoundland Banks, the barrier force was split on May&nbsp;2 to provide greater depth. The ''Mission Bay'' group reinforced the Second Barrier Force during this period, bringing its strength to three escort carriers and thirty one destroyer escorts.<ref>Lundeberg (1994), pp. 225<U+2013>226</ref>

''U-881'' became the fifth and final U-boat to be sunk during Operation Teardrop on May&nbsp;5. The boat was detected while attempting to pass submerged through the barrier line by {{USS|Farquhar|DE-139|6}} shortly before daybreak. The destroyer escort immediately turned to starboard and dropped depth charges, which sank the submarine with no survivors at 0616. ''U-881'' was the last German submarine to be sunk by the U.S. Navy during World War II.<ref name="Lundeberg_226">Lundeberg (1994), p. 226</ref>

==Aftermath==

The Second Barrier Force established its final barrier line along the [[60th meridian west|60th meridian]] on May&nbsp;7. Following the [[end of World War II in Europe]], it accepted the surrender of ''[[German submarine U-234|U-234]]'', ''U-805'', ''U-858'' and ''[[German submarine U-1228|U-1228]]'' at sea before returning to bases on the U.S. east coast.<ref name="Y'Blood_272">Y'Blood (2004), p. 272</ref>

The U.S.&nbsp;Navy continued its efforts to determine whether the U-boats had been carrying missiles after the German surrender. The crews of ''U-805'' and ''U-858'' were interrogated and confirmed that their boats were not fitted with missile launching equipment.<ref name="Lundeberg_227">Lundeberg (1994), p. 227</ref> Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant Fritz Stienhoff, who had commanded ''U-511'' during her rocket trials and was captured at sea when he surrendered [[German submarine U-873|''U-873'']], was subjected to an abusive interrogation at Portsmouth by the interviewers of ''U-546''<U+2019>s crew. An official navy investigation was held into this interrogation after Stienhoff committed suicide at [[Charles Street Jail]] in [[Boston]] shortly afterwards. It is not known if the Allies were aware of Stienhoff's involvement in the rocket trials.<ref name="Lundeberg_227" /><ref>Blair (1998), pp. 689<U+2013>690</ref>
[[File:USS Cusk;0834807.jpg|thumb|alt=A rocket taking off horizontally from the deck of a surfaced World War II-era submarine|A Loon being fired from {{USS|Cusk|SS-348|6}} in 1951]]

The tactics used in Operation Teardrop were evaluated by U.S.&nbsp;Navy officers after the war. The escort carriers' air wings were disappointed with their experience, as their ability to detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation. Despite this, the aircraft were successful in forcing the U-boats to remain submerged, thereby greatly slowing their speed.<ref name="Lundeberg_227" /> Other after action reports stressed the importance of teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Operation Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas.<ref name="Lundeberg_229">Lundeberg (1994), p. 229</ref> Nevertheless, Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as "a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics, derived in part from British experience, but also of the profound impact of communications intelligence in the interdiction of U-boat transit and operating areas."<ref name="Lundeberg_230">Lundeberg (1994), p. 230</ref>

A variant of the V-1 was used by the U.S.&nbsp;Navy to test the feasibility of launching missiles from submarines in the years after World War II. [[Republic-Ford JB-2|Republic-Ford JB-2 "Loon"]] missiles were launched from {{USS|Cusk|SS-348|6}} and {{USS|Carbonero|SS-337|6}} in a series of tests which began on February&nbsp;12, 1947. These tests were successful, and led to the development of further submarine-launched cruise missiles.<ref name="Polmar_87">Polmar and Moore (2004), p. 87</ref> The U.S. Navy's success in adapting a variant of the V-1 to be launched from submarines also demonstrated that it would have been technically feasible for the German Navy to have done the same.<ref>Duffy (2004), p. 72</ref>
