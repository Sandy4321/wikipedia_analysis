'''Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternate theories''' concerns the various theories put forward regarding the shooting down of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]].  The aircraft was en route from [[New York City]] via [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] to [[Seoul]] when it strayed into prohibited Soviet [[prohibited airspace|airspace]] and was shot down by Soviet jet fighters.

==Alternate theories==
Flight 007 has been the subject of ongoing controversy and has spawned a number of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]],<ref name="Knight">Knight, p. 381</ref> many of which are rooted in Cold War [[disinformation]] and propaganda campaigns,<ref>Pry, p. 31</ref><ref>Pearson, p.17</ref><ref>Young, p. 137</ref> the suppression of evidence such as the [[flight data recorder]]s<ref name="Bohlen">{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D91030F935A25753C1A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |publisher=New York Times |date=1992-10-16 |title=Tape Displays the Anguish On Jet the Soviets Downed |author=Bohlen, Celestine |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> and unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft flying in the area the same night.<ref name="Schultz367">Schultz, p. 367</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 175</ref>  The various theories that have been put forward generally reflect their authors' political orientations: Right-wing theories mirror the US government position in 1983, while left-wing theories reflect the Soviet position at the time.<ref>Knight, pp. 382-383</ref>  Some commentators also felt that the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) report into the incident failed to address key points adequately, such as the reason for the aircraft's deviation.<ref name="Daniloff, p. 304">Daniloff, p. 304</ref><ref>Johnson, pp. 230<U+2013>237</ref>  The release of flight data recorder evidence by the Soviet Union in 1993, ten years after the event, seriously challenged many of these theories.  Some alternative interpretations focus on evidential questions largely independent of political considerations.

One of the first theories was that [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] and a [[spy satellite|satellite]] were monitoring the airliner's progress over Soviet territory. ''Defence Attach<U+00E9>'', which printed this claim, was sued by [[Korean Air Lines]] and forced to pay damages and print an apology.<ref name="007backdown">''Time'', 1984-12-03</ref>

===Planned spy mission theory===
In 1994, Robert W Allardyce and James Gollin wrote ''Desired Track: The Tragic Flight of KAL Flight 007'', supporting the spy mission theory.<ref name="desired">{{cite web |url=http://www.planesafe.org/books/desiredtrack.shtml |title=Desired Track: The Tragic Flight of KAL Flight 007 |year=1994 |author=Robert W Allardyce & James Gollin |publisher=[http://www.planesafe.org planesafe.org]}}</ref> In 2007, they reiterated their position in a series of articles in ''[[Airways Magazine]]'', arguing that the investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization was a cover-up of a "carefully planned ferret mission".<ref name="airways">Allardyce & Gollin, 2007</ref> Furthermore they suggested that the [[NSA]] had implemented [[Electronic Counter Measures]] to cover for the mission and that the [[flight recorder]] tapes had been planted for the Soviet recovery effort to find.<ref name="airways">Allardyce & Gollin, October, 2007, pp 52<U+2013>56.</ref>

Planned spy mission theories point out incongruence of a civilian passenger liner going accidentally astray and unnoticed precisely in one of the most militarily sensitive and well observed areas of the Cold War. They point out the following: There were powerful land and sea radar arrays that could well have tracked KAL 007 as it crossed through NORAD prohibited-to-civilian flight zone and approached and entered Soviet territory. These were Cobra Judy aboard the U.S.S. Observation Island, then off the coast of Kamchatka; Shemya Island<U+2019>s Cobra Dane line of sight radar with maximum range of 28 thousand miles and capability of tracking an airplane at 30 thousand feet altitude through an area covering 400 miles (the curvature of the earth being its limiting factor); and Shemya Island<U+2019>s Cobra Talon, an over the horizon (OTH) <U+201C>backscatter<U+201D> radar array with a range from 575 miles to 2,070 miles. Cobra Talon operated by bouncing its emissions off the ionosphere (deflection) to the other side of the line of sight horizon, thus acquiring its targets. These radar arrays had capability for both surveillance and tracking. Whether this capability was actualized in the case of Flight 007 is currently unknown. In addition, the United States Air Force radar stations at Cape Newenham and Cape Romanzoff, two of twelve comprising the United States Alaskan Distant Early Warning/Aircraft Control and Warning (DEW/ACW) System, had the capability to track all aircraft heading toward the Russian Buffer Zone. Well within range of these radar sites, KAL 007 had veered directly toward Kamchatka.

===Theory of intentional deviation by pilots===
[[File:HSI.PNG|thumb|right|Horizonal Situation Indicator (stock image)]]
This theory stresses that the pilots must have known that they were off course, and if they persisted in their deviation, then that indicates intentionality, whether for espionage or, as some of the law firms contended, for fuel saving purposes (opposition to this second rational was based on the weaker advantage to be gained in comparison to enormous risk entailed). What could the pilots of KAL 007 have known of their course deviation? From Bethel, and at a {{convert|12.6|mi|km}} deviation, alert pilots could have known much<U+2014>starting with the [[Horizontal situation indicator|Horizonal Situation Indicator]].  Assuming that the aircraft's navigation systems were functional and correctly programmed, the Horizontal Situation Indicator<U+2019>s needle could have alerted the pilots of their course deviation. This is because the cockpit HSI console needle, capable of showing deviation only up to eight miles, would be <U+201C>pegged<U+201D> all the way to the side. The pilots, thus, should have known that they were at least eight miles off course. Despite this, strangely enough, at 13:49 GMT, the pilots were reporting that they were on course, <U+201C>007, Bethel at forty niner.<U+201D> And so, fifty minutes after takeoff, military radar at King Salmon, Alaska acquired KAL 007 at more than 12.6 miles off course. It had exceeded its expected leeway of deviation by six times (two nautical miles an hour is the maximum expected margin of error from a course set by INS). Furthermore, pilot and copilot should also have been aware of the aircraft<U+2019>s serious deviation because after Bethel, and much more than 12 miles off course, KAL 007 was too far off course for the pilots to make their required Very High Frequency (VHF) radio reports, and had to relay these reports via KAL Flight 015, just minutes behind it and on course (KAL 007,increasingly off course, would have to rely on KAL 015 three times to transmit its reports to Anchorage Air Traffic Control). That too should have alerted them. At one point in this section of its flight, (14:43 GMT) KAL 007 put a call through a navigational <U+201C>hookup,<U+201D> the International Flight Service Station on High Frequency. Flight 007, now too distant to speak directly with Anchorage Controller through Very High Frequency, was transmitting its message indirectly using High Frequency. The message was a change in the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for the next waypoint called NEEVA<U+2014>delaying by four minutes the ETA that KAL 015 had previously relayed on behalf of KAL 007. Since a revised ETA could only be calculated by means of readout information presented by KAL 007<U+2019>s Inertial Navigation Systems Control Display unit, pilot and copilot were once again presented with the opportunity of verifying their position and becoming aware of their enormous deviation. 

The weakness or inconclusiveness of the intentionality theory of deviation could only have been shown in 1992 with the handover by the Russian Federation of the Cockpit Voice Recorder tape. This showed that at the times of most danger during the flight, the flight crew was relaxed speaking about currency exchange at Kimpo airport, or bored, or even bantering with each other, indicating to ICAO analysts that the crew of KAL 007 were unaware of the danger they were then exposed to.

1808 Kozlov (Combat Controller Sokol Airbase): "He has the target in sight" 
Kornukov: "He can see it? How many jet trails are coming from it?" Kozlov: "Say again, Kornukov: How many jet trails are there, if there are four jet trails, then it's an RC-135"
 
1811:30<U+2013>39 KAL 007 Flight Crew: "I have heard that there is currency exchange at your airport." "In the airport currency exchange? What kind of money?" "Dollar to Korean money." "That's in the domestic building too, domestic building too." 

1811 Air Controller Titovnin: "Can you see the target, 805?"1811 Osipovich: "I see both visually and on the screen".

===Unplanned "intelligence bonus" theory===
[[Image:USAF Combat Sent.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]]]]
Proponents of this theory propose the following scenario and pose the following questions:
One of the great unknowns has always been the question of U.S. responsibility in KAL 007's deviation from course causing it to enter Soviet airspace over Kamchatka and the Sakhalin Island. This question was extremely pertinent in the light of the admitted fact that there was indeed a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in the vicinity as KAL 007 made its intrusion into Soviet airspace over Kamchatka. What it was doing was positioning to intercept the telemetry from the Soviet test launching of the first of all mobile Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), the illegal (according to the SALT agreements) SS-25 which was to hit the Klyuchi target range on Kamchatka. Could not the RC-135 have seen the jumbo jet and warned it of its danger, as well as informing its own command and civilian air traffic controllers? Could not it have intercepted the ground chatter from the Soviet posts along Kamchatka as Soviet MiGs were scrambled to intercept KAL 007 as it passed from the Soviet Flight Information Region (FIR) into the Soviet Defense Zone - forbidden to non-Soviet aircraft? Could not it have seen the Soviet radars along the coast lighting up as they successively captured the passenger aircraft as it dangerously made its way across Petropavlovsk on the coast bristling with its weaponry - its Pacific nuclear ICB submarine fleet, and its airfields? Around the time that KAL 007 entered Soviet airspace, this [[United States Air Force]] [[Boeing RC-135#RC-135S Cobra Ball|RC-135S Cobra Ball]] reconnaissance plane was in the area to capture the telemetry of an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] that was to hit the [[Klyuchi target range]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]].<ref>Pearson, p. 47</ref>  The United States military has not disclosed the capabilities and role of this aircraft.  During the civil litigation for damages to the families of the victims of the shoot-down, United States District Judge Aubrey Robinson, Chief Judge of the District Court for the [[District of Columbia]], held that victims could not access this information, on the grounds that it would endanger U.S. national security.  On April 18, 1984, he allowed questions to the military, "but only in respect to uncovering the legal duty of the military to warn or advise civilian aircraft."<ref>Pearson, p. 305</ref>  The following articles suggest possible answers to the questions that this theory brings up [http://www.rescue007.org/RC_135.htm], [http://www.rescue007.org/RC_135_cont.htm]


===Passenger survival and abduction theory===
[[Image:Larry McDonald.jpg|Congressman [[Larry McDonald|Lawrence McDonald]]|right|upright|thumb]]
More recently in 2000, ''Rescue 007: Untold Story of KAL 007 and its Survivors'' by Bert Schlossberg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rescue007.org/book.htm |title=rescue007 book |publisher=Rescue007.org |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> which is promoted by the author through the organization he directs, the International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/ |title=[Rescue 007 Home] |accessdate=2009-01-19 |publisher=International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors}}</ref> advanced a theory that KAL 007, though crippled, was able to [[water landing|land on water]] safely enough for at least some of its occupants to have been rescued by the Soviets in Soviet territorial waters, then retained, finally to be incarcerated in various locations in the Soviet Union. This best explains, according to the organization, the Soviet nine-year concealment of both the flight recorder tapes and the immediate Search and Rescue mission to Moneron Island involving helicopters, KGB coastal patrol boats, and civilian trawlers then close to Moneron (Military communications of which disclosed by the Russian Federation in 1992); the lack of bodies, body parts and tissues, and luggage; the otherwise mysterious abundance of shoes (indicating passengers might have been prepared for evacuation by slides); reports of survivor sightings,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/faq.htm#10 |title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the Downing of KAL Flight 007 and Attendant Matters |publisher=[http://www.rescue007.org rescue007.org] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref>; and the reported Soviet harassment of U.S. search efforts and preventing conducting of the search in Soviet waters. Particularly compelling, according to the organization, are the Soviet military transcripts handed over by the Russian Federation in 1992 revealing for the first time that KAL 007's post missile detonation descent, rather than resulting in a plunge to destruction, was arrested at 5,000 meters, KAL 007 continuing it's flight at that level for almost 5 minutes, and only over the only land mass in the entire Tatar straits, Moneron Island, did begin a slow spiral descent being tracked by Soviet radar until 1,000 ft. above sea level, the point under which Soviet radar could no longer further track due to curvature of the earth. The organization believes that there is credible evidence concerning the subsequent whereabouts of passengers Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] and 5 year old Noelle Anne Grenfell<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/grenfells.htm |title=The Grenfells |publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> to reopen the investigation into the shootdown and aftermath.

Though independent of the initiative by Senator [[Jesse Helms]] to launch a CIA investigation of the shootdown while he was ranking member of the Minority Staff ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], the International Committee for the Rescue of KAL 007 Survivors is undertaking a dissemination to the media of the 1991 Republican staff study<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/republican_staff_study.htm|title=Republican Staff Study/"CIA Report" Draft Now Available in Electronic Format for the First Time|publisher=[http://www.//rescue007.org rescue007.org] |date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> on the shootdown.  The organization fully supports both the Helms letter to Yeltsin<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue007.org/helms_letter.htm|title=Sen Jesse Helms Letter to Boris Yeltsin|publisher=[http://rescue007.org rescue007.org] |date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> requesting information about survivors, including Larry McDonald (which was sent, according to Admiral Bud Nance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rescue007.org/nance_letter.htm |title=Nance Letter |publisher=Rescue007.org |date=2009-03-08 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> the Staff director under Helms, as a direct result of information coming from Israel indicating possible survivors), and supports the conclusion of the study, <U+201C>KAL 007 probably ditched successfuly<!--sic???-->, there may have been survivors, the Soviets have been lying massively, and diplomatic efforts need to be made to return the possible survivors.<U+201D>

===Air battle cover-up theory===
Another theory was suggested by Michael Brun in his book ''Incident at Sakhalin: The True Mission of KAL Flight 007''.<ref>Burnett, p. 156</ref> According to this book, KAL007 was involved in a spy mission intended to trigger Soviet air defences and to cover the missions of several USAF [[surveillance aircraft|spy airplanes]].  The Korean aircraft was communicating with Tokyo-Narita controllers around half an hour after the official time of the shootdown.  A large air battle allegedly occurred between Soviet Air Force and USAF, during which the Soviets shot down several American aircraft, including an [[Boeing RC-135|RC-135]], an [[EF-111A Raven|EF-111]] and probably even an [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]].  The SU-15 pilot, Major Osipovich, flew two sorties and shot down two targets (contradicted by the 1991 interview with Osipovich<ref name="Illesh-Eng">Illesh, ''The Mystery of the KAL-007''</ref>).  According to the theory, the whereabouts of the KAL-007 wreckage is not known to anyone, but is probably {{convert|500|km|mi}} away from the Moneron island down the coast of Japan.  The theory postulates further that the real cause of the destruction is not known, but could have been a [[surface-to-air missile]] fired from {{USS|Badger|FF-1071|6}} (similar case with {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]]) or from Japanese forces, who could not identify the airliner which was keeping radio silence. The lack of bodies, body parts, and wreckage of KAL 007 around Sakhalin and Moneron Islands is an indication to Brun that KAL 007 did not come down in those locales. Sparce remains showing up on the beaches of Hokkaido, south of Moneron and Sakhalin, are evidence to Brun that KAL 007 was downed further south and these remains brought northward by the north running current of the Tsushima along the west Japanese coast. This opposes the commonly held understanding that the remains were brought down from Sakhalin and Moneron waters to the beaches of Hokkaido by the {{convert|1|mph|km/h}} southerly-flowing West Sakhalin current in between Moneron and Sakhalin islands and, near the tip of Sakhalin, 35 naut. miles away from Moneron, moved by the swifter (6 or 7 naut. miles an hour) West Sakhalin convergent current on into the Soya Strait and then onto the beaches of Hokkaido.

===Theories about the lack of bodies, body parts and tissues, and luggage at determined impact site of KAL 007===
These theories attempt to contend with the fact that there were no surface finds at the place posited for the KAL 007's impact with the water. There were no bodies, body parts or body tissues, and there were no luggage. Further, on sea bottom, there were only one partial torso and 10 body parts or tissues, possibly from the same individual, noted by surprised and amazed Soviet civilian divers who had commenced diving to the wreckage purported to be of KAL 007 just two weeks after the shootdown. Further, for all of the 269 occupants, divers reported with surprise either no luggage or, in one diver report, there were only a few pieces of luggage at the bottom
====KAL 007 was spy plane with only military complement====
[[Image:Shoes.jpg|Passengers' footwear retrieved by Soviets from the crash site|upright|thumb]]
The earliest was that there were no bodies found because KAL 007 had but a small complement of military personnel and no civilian passengers. This first version of the spy plane theory was by and large discarded by September 9, 1983, when Marshal Nicolay Ogarkov, U.S.S.R. Chief of General Staff and First Deputy Defense Minister, conceded that there had been civilian passengers aboard KAL 007. In his press conference of September 9, 1983, as quoted by Moscow Radio of the same date, Ogarkov stated, <U+201C>It has been proved irrefutably that the intrusion of the plane of the South Korean Airlines into Soviet airspace was a deliberately, thoroughly planned intelligence operation. It was directed from certain centers in the territory of the United States and Japan. A civilian plane was chosen for its deliberately, disregarding or, possibly, counting on loss of human life.<U+201D>The anguish of thousands of relatives and friends of the victims of KAL 007 had also discredited this non-civilian passenger theory from the start.

====Crab theory====
The second theory for the virtual disappearance of 269 people from the site of the crash is suggested by Soviet correspondent Andrey Illesh in his book, The Mystery of Korean Boeing 747. This theory proposes that the bodies were eaten by [[Japanese spider crab|giant crabs]]. There is even a picture of one of those crabs that supposedly populate the sea bottom where KAL 007 finally came to rest. The crab theory has been persistent and been echoed by the Soviet interceptor pilot Gennadie Osipovich himself (though evidently not with full conviction). 

[[File:Macrocheira kaempferi.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese spider crab]]
<U+201C><U+2026>I heard that they had found the <U+2018>Boeing<U+2019> when I was still on Sakhalin. And even investigated it. But no one saw people there. I, however, explain that by the fact that there are crabs in the sea off Sakhalin that immediately devour everything<U+2026> I did hear that they found only a hand in a black glove. Perhaps it was the hand of the pilot of the aircraft that I shot down. You know, even now I cannot really believe that there were passengers on board. You cannot write off everyone to the crabs<U+2026> Surely something would be left?<U+2026> Nevertheless, I am a supporter of the old version: It was a spy plane. In any event, it was not happenstance that it flew towards us.<U+201D> '''<ref>Izvestia, Feb. 8, 1991, pg. 7</ref> 

Professor William Newman, marine biologist, explains why the crab (or any other sea creature) theory is untenable: <U+201C>Even if we proceed from the supposition that crustaceans, or sharks, or something else fell upon the flesh, the skeletons should have remained. In many cases, skeletons were found on the sea or ocean floor, which had sat there for many years and,even decades In addition, the crustaceans would not have touched bones.<U+201D> In addition, the Crab theory could not account for the lack of luggage.

====Decompression theory====
The third explanation is provided by [[Izvestia|Izvestiya]] correspondents Shalnev's and Illesh's interview of Mikhail Igorevich Girs, Captain of the Tinro 2 submersible which made most of the dives. In the May 31, 1991 edition Izvestia, Capt. Girs provides this fourth explanation<U+2014>the passengers were sucked out of the aircraft, leaving their clothes behind<ref>Izvestiya, May 28, 1991, p. 8</ref> 

<U+201C>Something else was inexplicable to us<U+2014>zipped up clothes. For instance, a coat, slacks, shorts, a sweater with zippers<U+2014>the items were different, but, zipped up. And nothing inside. We came to this conclusion then: Most likely, the passengers had been pulled out of the plane by decompression, and they fell in a completely different place from where we found the debris. They had been spread out over a much larger area. The current also did its work.<U+201D><ref>Izvestiya, May 28, 1991</ref>

===="Windtunnel" theory====
The latest reference to the decompression theory of the missing bodies is mentioned by Lieutenant General Valeri Kamenski, most recently Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force and formerly Chief of Staff of the Soviet Far East Military District Air Defense Force in an article dated March 15, 2001, in the Ukrainian weekly, <U+201C>Facti I Kommentari<U+201D>, General Kamenski spoke about the mystery. <U+201C>It is still a mystery what happened to the bodies of the crew and passengers on the plane. According to one theory, right after the rocket<U+2019>s detonation, the nose and tail section of the jumbo fell off and the mid fuselage became a sort of wind tunnel so the people were swept through it and scattered over the surface of the ocean. Yet in this case, some of the bodies were to have been found during the search operations in the area. The question of what actually happened to the people has not been given a distinct answer.<U+201D>
====Soviet naval diver removal of passengers theory====
This theory rests on the fact that when the Soviet civilian divers first went down to the wreck just 2 weeks after the shootdown, the finds they encountered were contrary to an aircraft having fallen from the sky, and corresponded more to "secondary placement" of the wreckage, and removal of the occupants of KAL 007, both passengers and aircrew, by the Soviet navy who they claim had been at work prior to them, both as divers, and in the use of trawlers.

<U+201C>The first submergence was on 15 September, two weeks after the aircraft had been shot down. As we learned then, before us the trawlers had done some <U+2018>work<U+2019> in the designated quadrant. It is hard to understand what sense the military saw in the trawling operation. First drag everything haphazardly around the bottom by the trawls, and then send in the submersibles?...It is clear that things should have been done in the reverse order.<U+201D><ref>Izvestia, May 27, 1991, pg. 6</ref>

Captain Mikhail Igorevich Girs: "Submergence 10 October. Aircraft pieces, wing spars, pieces of aircraft skin, wiring, and clothing. But<U+2014>no people. The impression is that all of this has been dragged here by a trawl rather than falling down from the sky<U+2026>"<ref>Izvestiya, May 28, 1991, p. 8</ref>

This was one of the theories expressed in the original izvestia series of 1990,91, and the later interview of Civilian diver Vadim Kondrabaev (later reprinted in English by Roy's Russian Aircraft Review).   Russian deep sea diver Vadim Kondrabaev, one of the civilian divers brought to explore the wreckage of KAL 007 in 1983 gave an interview to the Russian magazine Itogi published on October 1, 2000. He points out that after he and the other civilian divers were brought to Sakhalin on September 10, 1983, they were kept there until "the end of September."  "...They literally forgot about us for several days."  When they did get to the wreckage, they were surprised to find neither bodies nor luggage. "...of the people who supposedly were on board, something should have remained.  We worked beneath the water almost a month for 5 hours a day and didn't find one suitcase, not even a handle from them.  After all there is baggage on any air trip. We either were able to work on the remains, which already had been filtered by the special services, or, what I also do not discount, there were no passengers at all on the airplane, and they stuffed the cabin with rubbish.  ...It is quite possible that several mini submarines with military divers went down to the Boeing even before us and collected everything, and scattered the remaining parts of the destroyed liner about or left them there where they were needed, and afterwards called us as a smoke screen."<ref> http://www.royfc.com/news/oct/0001oct01.html</ref>

==={{anchor|Meaconing}}Meaconing of KAL 007 and the attempt of assassination theory===
[[Meaconing]] is the term to describe the interception and the rebroacasting of [[radio navigation|navigational signals]] in order to confuse the sending aircraft as to its true location.  (There is an assumption that the target does not have secondary navigational aids such as [[Inertial navigation system|INS]] or [[Radar navigation|radar]]).  This is a prelude to the deviation such as experienced KAL 007 in its intended course from Anchorage Alaska to Seoul Korea. Meaconing had been used frequently during the Cold War. This theory often entails the following points which are shown to be true from the transcripts or assumed to be true by the holders of this theory: 

The pilots of KAL 007 clearly believed that they were on another course than that they were actually flying; Democratic Congressman Larry McDonald was known to be aboard KAL 007 and he was considered the chief anti-Communist in Congress as well as the second head of the [[John Birch Society]]; other anti-communist lawmakers were understood to have been with Larry McDonald aboard KAL 007 and were not known to have opted for another flight, KAL 015; These congressmen were North Carolina Sen. [[Jesse Helms]], Idaho Sen. Steven Symms, and Kentucky Rep. Carroll J. Hubbard Jr. The intended destination and purpose of all these congressman was ostensibly the Seoul celebration for the 30 year anniversary of the U.S. Korea Mutual Defense Treaty, but in actuallity, the main purpose was for furthering the anti-Communist coalition, and activity. It is sometimes intimated<ref>http://old.disinfo.com/archive/pages/article/id1197/pg1/index.html</ref>that the Soviet meaconing of KAL 007 was with the tacit approval or with the active participation and planning of leftist and socialistic power centers of the U.S. Government; and finally, in support of the meacon theory, this information that surfaced during the ICAO investigation and is considered indicative of purposful intent to cause KAL 007 to go astray: At 28 minutes after takeoff, civilian radar at Kenai, on the eastern shore of Cook Inlet and 53 nautical miles southwest of Anchorage, with a radar coverage of 175 miles west of Anchorage, tracked KAL 007 more than six miles north of where it should have been. Where it should have been was a location <U+201C>fixed<U+201D> by the nondirectional radio beacon (NDB) of Cairne Mountain. The NDB navigational aid operates by transmitting a continuous three-letter identification code which is picked up by the airborne receiver, the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF). Flights emanating from Anchorage, Alaska, traveling along route J501 had to pass Cairne Mt. Cairne Mountain was KAL 007<U+2019>s first assigned navigational aid out of Anchorage Airport. Something was going wrong. That night, Douglas L. Porter was the controller at Air Route Traffic Control Center at Anchorage, assigned to monitor all flights in that section, recording their observed position in relation to the fix provided by the Cairne Mountain nondirectional beacon. Porter later testified that all had seemed normal to him.<ref>Testimony of Douglas L. Porter, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, October 6, 1984.</ref> Yet he apparently failed to record<ref>KAL 007: the Coverup, David Pearson, Summit Books, New York 1987, Pg. 37</ref>, as required, the position of two flights that night<U+2014>and only two: KAL 007, carrying Democratic Congressman McDonald and 268 others, and KAL 015, carrying Republican Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Steven Symms of Idaho, Congressman Carroll J. Hubbard Jr. of Kentucky, and others, which followed KAL 007 by several minutes. If he had recorded them, the possibility of warning KAL 007 of its deviation would have resulted in the necessary correction for the rest of the flight. To holders of the meaconing theory, the above seem both curious and ominous and ancillary to their theory.

===U.S. Governmental Cover-up theory===
Holders of this theory point to two sets of facts indicating that the U.S. government had covered up the incident and had skewed the investigation for political ends. The first set of facts relate to U.S. capability and actuality of tracking KAL 007 in its deviated flight, thus presenting the possibility of warning the air craft in time to avert its entrance into harms way. 

The Cape Newenham and Cape Romanzoff radars monitored at the NORAD Regional Operations Command Center were but two of twelve comprising the United States Alaskan Distant Early Warning/Aircraft Control and Warning (DEW/ACW) System. These United States Air Force radar stations at Cape Newenham and Cape Romanzoff in Alaska had the capability to track all aircraft heading toward the Russian Buffer Zone, though it is not known if the radar results of such "outgoing" tracking would have been monitored in "real-time" at the facility at Elmendorf Air Force base. These tapes remain unavailable to the public for national security reasons. But there was another location at which KAL 007 could well have been tracked in its deviation. This was at the installation at King Salmon, Alaska.  It is customary for the Air Force to impound radar trackings involving possible litigation in cases of aviation accidents.<ref name="Pearson, p. 309">Pearson, p. 309</ref> In the civil litigation for damages, the [[United States Department of Justice]] explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL 007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first, Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, he said he had "misspoken" and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] spokesman concurred, saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24<U+2013>30 hours afterwards,<ref>U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, ''In re: Korean Airlines disaster of Sept. 1, 1983'', 28 February 1985</ref> however the fate of KAL 007 was known inside this timeframe.<ref name="Pearson, p. 309"/> Well within the 30 hours, it was known that something disasterous had happened to KAL 007. Why were not these tapes impounded, as the practice was,  preventing them from being destroyed?

The second set of facts relate to a series of moves taking the investigation out of the hands of the hands of the National Transportation Safety Board and in the hands of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Normally, when an airliner crashes, responsibility for the inquiry falls to the N.T.S.B. , which has the technical expertise to assess what happened.  Although the downing of the Flight 007 cannot be classified as a routine aviation disaster, the N.T.S.B. office in Anchorage was notified that the plane was missing just three hours after it had come down in the Sea of Japan and immediately began to look into the matter. Shortly, after that, it was told to cease its investigation and forward to its headquarters in Washington all the material - originals and copies - it had gathered. From there, the information was sent to the State Department.  James Michelangelo, chief of the N.T. S. B.'s Anchorage office, was told by headquarters that the Board was off the case and that the State Department would handle the investigation.  Eighteen months after the airliner was shot down, when asked if the State Department had ever conducted such an enquiry, a high-level State Department official, Lynn Pascoe, replied, "How is the State Department going to investigate?"<ref>The Nation Magazin, David Corn, Aug 17/ Aug. 24, 1985</ref><ref>KAL 007: the Cover-up, David Pearson, Summit books, N.Y., pg. 128</ref>

Holders of this theory ask why was the effective investigation in progress - conducted by the N.T.S.B.- Anchorage station chief, James Michelangelo - preempted (the very first occurance) by the Washington based N.T.S.B. home office under orders from the State Department, which itself did not, as originally announced, investigate the disaster, but rather referred  the investigation to the political and investigatively ineffective United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization? The ICAO has no subpoena powers and, according to its mandate, can analyse only material presented to by its constituent interested members. ICAO's final reports, it is mantained, are reflections of the politically expedient rather than of an independent investigative determination. The only other air disaster ICAO had ever investigated was the Israeli shootdown of [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114]] over the Sinai. 


In January 1996, Hans Ephraimson, chairman of the "American Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims", claimed that South Korean President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] accepted $4 million from Korean Air in order to gain "government protection" during the investigation of the shootdown.<ref>Ephraimson, ''Korean Bribe Rekindles Flight 007 Issues''</ref>
