Captain '''Frederick John Gibbs''' was a World War I [[flying ace]] credited with 11 official victories. Post-war, he went into business. During the beginning of World War II, he took the unusual step of giving up his officer's commission in favour of joining the military in the ranks.

By mid-1917, he had been trained as a [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Pour L'Aviation et ses D<U+00E9>riv<U+00E9>s|Spad]] pilot and was posted with 23 Squadron in France. On 2 June 1917, he opened his victory roll when he drove down a German [[Albatros D.III]] fighter out of control. Later that month, on the 17th, he destroyed a [[Deutsche Flugzeug-Werke|DFW]] two-seater reconnaissance plane. On 27 July 1917, he scored twice, driving down an [[Albatros D.V]] fighter on one patrol and sharing in the destruction of an [[Aviatik]] recon plane with [[Roger Neville]] on another. The destruction of another DFW on 13 August made him an ace.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/england/gibbs1.php Retrieved 28 March 2011.</ref>
