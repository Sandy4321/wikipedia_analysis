A '''genetic disorder''' is an [[illness]] caused by abnormalities in [[gene]]s or [[chromosome]]s. While some [[disease]]s, such as [[cancer]], are due in part to genetic disorders, they can also be caused by [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors. Most disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. Some types of recessive gene disorders confer an advantage in the [[Zygosity|heterozygous state]] in certain environments.<ref>[http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/tdc02/sci/life/gen/lp_disorder/index.html WGBH Educational Foundation]</ref>

A '''single gene disorder''' is the result of a single [[mutation|mutated]] gene. There are estimated to be over 4000 human diseases caused by single gene defects. Single gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. [[Genomic imprinting]] and [[uniparental disomy]], however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive and dominant]] types are not "hard and fast" although the divisions between [[autosome|autosomal]] and [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, [[achondroplasia]] is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes  for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder that achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers of. [[Sickle-cell anemia]] is also considered a recessive condition, but [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] carriers have increased immunity to [[malaria]] in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a single gene disorder and wish to have a child they can do so through IVF whichs means they can then have PGD (Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis) to check whether the fertilised egg has had the genetic disorder passed on.<ref name="pmid15758612">{{cite journal |author=Kuliev A, Verlinsky Y |title=Preimplantation diagnosis: A realistic option for assisted reproduction and genetic practice |journal=Curr.

===Autosomal dominant===
{{Main|Autosomal dominant#Autosomal dominant gene}}
Only one mutated copy of the gene will be necessary for a person to be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. There is a 50% chance that a child will inherit the mutated gene.  Conditions that are autosomal dominant often have low [[penetrance]], which means that although only one mutated copy is needed, a relatively small proportion of those who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease.  Examples of this type of disorder are [[Huntington's disease]], [[Neurofibromatosis 1]], [[Marfan Syndrome]], [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]], and [[Hereditary multiple exostoses]], which is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.

===Autosomal recessive===
{{Main|Autosomal dominant#Autosomal recessive allele}}
Two copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder. An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers). Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene have a 25% chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. Examples of this type of disorder are [[cystic fibrosis]], [[sickle-cell disease]] (also partial sickle-cell disease), [[Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Niemann-Pick disease]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]], [[Roberts Syndrome]], and Dry (otherwise known as "rice-brand") [[earwax]].<ref name=Wade>{{  cite journal  | author= Wade, Nicholas  | title=Japanese Scientists Identify Ear Wax Gene  | journal=New York Times | date= January 29, 2006 }}</ref>

===X-linked dominant===
{{Main|X-linked dominant}}
X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the [[X chromosome]]. Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern, with a prime example being [[X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets]].  Males and females are both affected in these disorders, with males typically being more severely affected than females.  Some X-linked dominant conditions such as [[Rett syndrome]], [[Incontinentia Pigmenti]] type 2 and [[Aicardi Syndrome]] are usually fatal in males either in utero or shortly after birth, and are therefore predominantly seen in females.  Exceptions to this finding are extremely rare cases in which boys with [[Klinefelter Syndrome]] (47,XXY) also inherit an X-linked dominant condition and exhibit symptoms more similar to those of a female in terms of disease severity.  The chance of passing on an X-linked dominant disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked dominant disorder will all be unaffected (since they receive their father's Y chromosome), and his daughters will all inherit the condition. A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected fetus with each pregnancy, although it should be noted that in cases such as [[Incontinentia Pigmenti]] only female offspring are generally viable.  In addition, although these conditions do not alter fertility per se, individuals with [[Rett syndrome]] or [[Aicardi syndrome]] rarely reproduce.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===X-linked recessive===
{{Main|X-linked recessive}}
X-linked recessive conditions are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, and the chance of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene.  A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (X<sup>R</sup>X<sup>r</sup>) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers.  X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases [[Hemophilia A]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], and [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]] as well as common and less serious conditions such as [[Androgenic alopecia|male pattern baldness]] and  red-green [[color blindness]].  X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to [[skewed X-inactivation]] or [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X (Turner syndrome)]].

===Y-linked===
{{Main|Y linkage}}
Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome.  Because males inherit a Y chromosome from their fathers, ''every'' son of an affected father will be affected.  Because females inherit an X chromosome from their fathers, female offspring of affected fathers are ''never'' affected.

Since the Y chromosome is relatively small and contains very few genes, there are relatively few Y-linked disorders.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  Often the symptoms include infertility, which may be circumvented with the help of some fertility treatments. Examples are [[infertility|Male Infertility]] and [[hypertrichosis pinnae]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Mitochondrial===
{{Main|Mitochondrial disease}}
This type of inheritance, also known as maternal inheritance, applies to genes in [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers can pass on mitochondrial conditions to their children. An example of this type of disorder is [[Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy]].

==Multifactorial and polygenic (complex) disorders==

Genetic disorders may also be complex, multifactorial or polygenic, this means that they are likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Multifactoral disorders include [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person<U+2019>s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified.

On a pedigree, polygenic diseases do tend to <U+201C>run in families<U+201D>, but the inheritance does not fit simple patterns as with [[Mendelian]] diseases.  But this does not mean that the genes cannot eventually be located and studied.  There is also a strong environmental component to many of them (e.g., blood pressure).
