The '''Falkland Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|f|<U+0254><U+02D0>|l|k|l|<U+0259>n|d}}; {{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}) are an [[archipelago]] located in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the [[Patagonian Shelf]]. The principal islands are about {{convert|500|km|abbr=off|sigfig=1|disp=flip}} east of the [[Patagonia]]n coast at a latitude of about 52<U+00B0>S. The archipelago, which has an area of {{convert|12173|sqkm|abbr=off|disp=flip}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]], and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the islands enjoy a large degree of [[self-governing|internal self-governance]], with the [[United Kingdom]] guaranteeing [[good governance]] and taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.

Controversy exists over the Falklands' original discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had [[France|French]], [[Great Britain|British]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and [[Argentina|Argentine]] settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|re-established its rule in 1833]], though Argentina maintained its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim]] to the islands. In 1982, following Argentina's [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the islands]], the two-month undeclared [[Falklands War]] between both countries resulted in the surrender of Argentine forces and the return of the islands to British administration.

The population, estimated at 2,932 in 2012, primarily consists of native [[Falkland Islanders]], the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]], and [[Scandinavia]]n. Immigration from the United Kingdom, [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant and official language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are legally [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

The islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subarctic and temperate maritime climate]] zones with both major islands having mountain ranges reaching to {{convert|700|m|ft|disp=flip}}. The islands are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of the effects of introduced species. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism, and sheep farming with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.

==Etymology==
{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}

The Falkland Islands are named after the [[Falkland Sound]], a [[strait]] that separates the archipelago's two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=73}} The name "Falkland" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], the captain of an [[Kingdom of England|English]] expedition that landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honor of [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]] who had sponsored the long journey.{{sfn|Dotan|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Room|2006|p=129}} The Viscount's title originates from the town of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], [[Scotland]], whose name comes from the term "folkland" (meaning land held by [[Anglo-Saxon law|folkright]]).{{sfn|Room|2006|p=129}} The name would not be applied to the islands until 1765, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] captain [[John Byron]] claimed them for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as "Falkland's Islands".{{sfn|Room|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Paine|2000|p=45}}

The Spanish name for the archipelago, ''Islas Malvinas'', is drawn from the French ''<U+00CE>les Malouines'', the name given to the islands by [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] in 1764.{{sfn|Hince|2001|p=121}} Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of [[Saint-Malo]], the point of departure for his ships and colonists.{{sfn|Room|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Hince|2001|p=121}} The port, located in the [[Brittany]] region of western France, was in turn named after [[Malo (saint)|St. Malo]] (or Maclou), the Christian [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the city.{{sfn|Balmaceda|2011|p=Chapter 36}}

[[Philology|Philologist]] F<U+00E9>lix Rodr<U+00ED>guez Gonz<U+00E1>lez argues that, in the English language, the Spanish name functions "as a [[Sign (semiotics)|semiotic sign]]" with a prejudicial meaning. He bases his conclusion on "the general rejection of the [Spanish] name" by media in the United States and Britain during the Falklands War, adding that British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' "[defied] national pride" when it "dared to call the islands ''Malvinas''".{{sfn|Rodr<U+00ED>guez Gonz<U+00E1>lez|1996|p=75}} The [[United Nations]] uses both the Spanish and English names;{{sfn|Osma<U+0144>czyk|2003|p=1373}} its official designation for the territory is "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".<ref name=std_name>{{cite web | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm | title= Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications | publisher=United Nations Statistics Division | date=13 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>

The Falklands remained uninhabited until two separate settlements, one established on [[East Falkland]] in 1764 by French captain [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] and the other founded on [[West Falkland]] in 1766 by British captain [[John MacBride (Royal Navy officer)|John MacBride]],{{efn-ua|In 1764, Bougainville claimed the islands in the name of [[Louis XV of France]]. In 1765, British captain John Byron claimed the islands in the name of [[George III of Great Britain]], leaving behind a small garden which Britain later claimed as proof of possession over the archipelago.{{sfn|Gustafson|1988|pp=9<U+2013>10}}{{sfn|Dunmore|2005|p=139<U+2013>140}}}} were established. The French and British settlements were possibly unaware of one another.{{sfn|Goebel|1971|pp=226, 232, 269}}{{efn-ua|Foreign affairs expert Lowell Gustafson explains that Britain had at least partial knowledge about the existence of the French settlement. Gustafson further writes that "[t]he Spanish, who had already purchased but not formally taken control of the French colony, would argue that it was public knowledge that France had settled on the islands before anyone else".{{sfn|Gustafson|1988|pp=9<U+2013>10}}}} After France "relinquished its rights [over the Falklands] to Spain" in 1766, the Spanish [[Puerto Soledad|settled the islands]] in 1767.{{sfn|Segal|1991|p=240}} Problems began when Spain discovered the British settlement at [[Port Egmont]]; an [[Falklands Crisis (1770)|imminent war]], caused by [[Capture of Port Egmont|Spain's capture of the port]] in 1770, was avoided by the restitution of the settlement to Britain.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p=26}} The Falklands were again abandoned when the British evacuated them in 1774 and the Spanish followed suit in 1811, except for "a few [[gaucho]]s and fishermen" who remained "to look after themselves".{{sfn|Gibran|1998|pp=26<U+2013>27}}{{efn-ua|Historian Daniel Gibran posits that Britain's withdrawal was "partly because of new strategic priorities and economic considerations", but "left behind a plaque" asserting the territory as "the sole right and property of His Most Sacred Majesty George the Third".{{sfn|Gibran|1998|pp=26<U+2013>27}} Gibran adds that for the next several years, "Spain, through  its [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata|vice-royalty in Buenos Aires]], was the sole administrator of the Falkland Islands". However, the unsuccessful development of the settlement culminated in Spain's withdrawal amidst fears of invasion during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p=27}}}}

The status of the archipelago went unchecked until 1820, when [[United States|American]] colonel [[David Jewett]], a [[privateer]] working for the [[United Provinces of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]], informed "the more than 50 ships at anchor" about [[Buenos Aires]]' 1816 claim of possession "over Spain's rights to the islands in the South Atlantic".{{sfn|Marley|2008|p=714}}{{sfn|Gibran|1998|p=27}}{{efn-ua|According to Argentine legal analyst Roberto Laver, the United Kingdom disregards Jewett's actions because the government he represented "was not recognized either by Britain or any other foreign power at the time" and "no act of occupation followed the ceremony of claiming possession".{{sfn|Laver|2001|p=73}}}} Owing to Jewett's inability "to establish his authority over this hard-living crowd",{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|p=48}} coupled with little emigration from Buenos Aires to the islands,{{sfn|Marley|2008|p=714}} the Falklands remained ungoverned until [[Luis Vernet]] re-established the old Spanish settlement under its former French name ([[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]]){{efn-ua|Vernet's venture received permission and encouragement from Buenos Aires;{{sfn|Marley|2008|p=714}}{{sfn|Sicker|2002|p=32}} but, prior to departing for the Falklands, Vernet "took his grant to the British Consulate where it received their stamp".{{sfn|Cawkell|2001|p=48}} Historian Mary Cawkell explains that Vernet would again repeat his actions with the British Consulate after "the Buenos Aires Government&nbsp;... extended his grant [in 1828] to cover the entire islands and Staten Island and exempted his enterprise from all taxation provided he established a colony within three years".{{sfn|Cawkell|2001|pp=49<U+2013>50}} Cawkell further claims that the positive relations between Vernet and the British Consulate led the former to express "the wish that, in the event of the British returning to the islands, [[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]] would take his settlement under their protection".{{sfn|Cawkell|2001|p=50}}}} in 1826.{{sfn|Sicker|2002|p=32}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=14}}{{efn-ua|Afterwards, in 1829, Buenos Aires proclaimed Vernet as the military and civil commander of the islands.{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp=540<U+2013>546}}}} Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the [[United States Ship|USS]] [[USS Lexington (1825)|''Lexington'']] in 1831,{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp=541<U+2013>544}}{{efn-ua|The log of the ''Lexington'' only reports the destruction of arms and a powder store, but Vernet made a claim for compensation from the US Government stating that the entire settlement was destroyed.{{sfn|Pascoe|Pepper|2008|pp=541<U+2013>544}}}} at which point [[Silas Duncan|the ship's commander]] "declared the island government at an end".{{sfn|Peterson|1964|p=106}}

Buenos Aires attempted to reorganize its authority over the settlement by forming a garrison, but a mutiny of troops in 1832 was inadvertently followed the next year by the arrival of British forces who [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted Britain's rule]].{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|p=50}}{{efn-ua|The [[Argentine Confederation]], headed by Buenos Aires governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], protested Britain's reacquisition of the Falklands.{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|pp=25<U+2013>26}} Nevertheless, as discussed by Roberto Laver, not only did Rosas not break relations with Britain due to the "essential" nature of "British economic support", but he even offered the Falklands "as a bargaining chip&nbsp;... in exchange for the cancellation of Argentina's million-pound debt with the British bank of [[Baring Brothers]]".{{sfn|Laver|2001|pp=122<U+2013>123}} Moreover, in 1850, Rosas' government ratified the [[Arana<U+2013>Southern Treaty]] which put "an end to the existing differences, and of restoring perfect relations of friendship" between the United Kingdom and Argentina.{{sfn|Hertslet|1851|p=105}}}} Nonetheless, the British soon departed, leaving the area "a kind of no man's land" and returning months later to find the port ravaged by murder and looting.{{efn-ua|Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman [[Matthew Brisbane]], returned to the islands "in the hope of restarting the business". His venture came to an abrupt end after unrest at Port Louis caused a group of "malcontents", led by [[Antonio Rivero]], to murder Brisbane (and other residents) and loot the port. The survivors "fled to a cave on a near island".{{sfn|Graham-Yooll|2002|pp=51<U+2013>52}}}} In 1840, the Falklands "officially became a [[Crown Colony]]", and "a governor and a few Scotsmen arrived to establish a British pastoral settlement".{{sfn|Aldrich|Connell|1998|p=201}} By 1844, "almost all settlers" relocated to [[Port Stanley]], deemed an improved location for governance of the islands.{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|p=27}}

[[File:Cfbattlepainting.jpg|left|thumb|Naval confrontation during the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands. Painting by [[William Lionel Wyllie]]]]

In the first half of the 20th century, the Falklands "proved to be an important military base for controlling the South Atlantic during the two world wars". A [[World War I]] naval encounter, the December 1914 [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], resulted in a British victory over [[German Empire|imperial Germany]]. In [[World War II]], "the same waters" hosted the December 1939 [[Battle of the River Plate]], a victory of the [[Royal Navy]] over the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''.{{sfn|Carafano|2005|p=367}}

Sovereignty of the Falklands again became an important issue in the second half of the 20th century, when Argentine president [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]] "asserted Argentine sovereignty" over the archipelago, causing a rise in tensions.{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|p=102}} The sovereignty dispute again intensified in the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on [[decolonization]] that Argentina identified as favorable to its position.{{sfn|Laver|2001|p=125}} Negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina failed to reach any meaningful conclusion.{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|p=102}} In 1982, the disagreement became [[Falklands War|an armed conflict]] when Argentina [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the Falklands]] and other [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|British territories in the South Atlantic]], briefly [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|occupying them]] until a UK [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] retook the territories that same year.{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|pp=102<U+2013>103}}{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|pp=5, 67}}{{efn-ua|The 1982 Falklands War lasted a few months, starting with the Argentine invasion on April 2 and ending with the Argentine surrender on June 14.{{sfn|Reginald|Elliot|1983|pp=10<U+2013>12}}}}

After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence on the islands, constructing [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] and increasing the garrison's size.{{sfn|Gibran|1998|pp=130<U+2013>135}} The UK and Argentina "normalized" diplomatic relations in 1990.{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|pp=102<U+2013>103}} In 1998, Argentine president [[Carlos Menem]], in a letter to Falklanders, "called for reconciliation 'to heal old wounds'". Nevertheless, relations thereafter deteriorated because of air travel disagreements and the UK's refusal to resume sovereignty negotiations "in the absence of evidence that the islanders themselves sought a change".{{sfn|Lansford|2012|p=1528}}{{efn-ua|In 1999, when Chile protested General [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s detention in London by temporarily halting flights to the Falklands, "the only such contact between the islands and South America", Argentina and the UK "agreed to permit air travel between Argentina and the islands". Nonetheless, in 2004, after Argentina "granted its flagship airline two routes between Buenos Aires and Stanley", the Falkland Islanders "rejected the prospect of regularly scheduled flights from Argentina". The Argentine government responded by forbidding Chilean airplanes from flying through Argentine airspace.{{sfn|Lansford|2012|p=1528}}}} Ongoing disputes among the involved governments have led "some analysts [to] predict a growing conflict of interest between Argentina and Great Britain&nbsp;... because of the recent expansion of the fishing industry in the waters surrounding the Falklands".{{sfn|Zepeda|2005|p=103}}

=== Sovereignty dispute ===

[[File:Malvinas cartel - Puerto Iguaz<U+00FA>.jpg|thumb|left|A sign in Argentina proclaims "The Malvinas are Argentine".]]

The United Kingdom and Argentina claim control over the Falkland Islands and its [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|dependencies]]. The UK bases its position on continuous administration of the islands since 1833 (apart from [[Argentine occupation of the Falkland Islands|1982]]) and the islanders having a "right to self determination, including their right to remain British if that is their wish".<ref name=FCO>{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/south-america/falkland-islands/ |title=Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory) |publisher=United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office |work=Travel & living abroad |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> Argentina posits that it acquired the Falklands from Spain, upon [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|achieving independence]] in 1816, and that the UK illegally occupied them in 1833.<ref name=RIS>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.ar/es/la-cuestion-de-las-islas-malvinas|title=La Cuesti<U+00F3>n de las Islas Malvinas|language=Spanish|author=Secretar<U+00ED>a de Relaciones Exteriores|publisher=Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Culto (Rep<U+00FA>blica Argentina)|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>

The present dispute began shortly after the passage, in 1960, of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution]] 1514 on [[decolonization]]. Argentina then reasserted its sovereignty claims "before the United Nations special committee for non-self-governing territories". In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, which "called upon both Britain and Argentina to peacefully settle the dispute through bilateral negotiations".{{sfn|Laver|2001|p=125}}

Later that decade, intending to improve its relations with South America by transferring the Falkland Islands (with provisions to protect the islanders' way of life), the United Kingdom secretly discussed the subject with Argentina. However, when the news became public, the Falklanders protested against the plans. As a result, the UK increased its focus on the Islanders' [[self-determination]]; Argentina disagreed, and negotiations effectively remained at a stalemate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1987/CRD.htm |title=The Argentine Seizure Of The Malvinas [Falkland] Islands: History and Diplomacy |author=Richard D.

Modern Falkland Islanders continue to reject the Argentine sovereignty claim.

Contemporary Argentine policy maintains the position that modern Falkland Islanders do not have a right to self-determination.

Falklands culture is fundamentally "based on the British culture brought with the settlers from the [[British Isles]]", though it has been partly influenced by the cultures of [[Hispanic America|Hispanic South America]].{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p=139}} Some terms and toponyms used by the islands' former [[Gaucho]] inhabitants are still commonly used in local speech.{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p=21}} The Falklands' predominant language is [[British English]], and part of the population (2.5%) is [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking]].{{sfn|Minahan|2013|p=139}}  According to naturalist [[Will Wagstaff]], "the Falkland Islands are a very social place, and stopping for a chat is a way of life".{{sfn|Wagstaff|2001|p=21}}
