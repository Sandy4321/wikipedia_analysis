'''Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher'''<!-- ''not'' "Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven" -->, {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Garter|LG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]}} ([[n<U+00E9>e]] '''Roberts'''; born 13&nbsp;October 1925) is a British politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990. Dubbed the "[[Iron Lady]]" for her tough rhetoric in opposition to the [[Soviet Union]], she was the first female British prime minister and the longest-serving of the 20th century, well known for her strict conservative policies that have come to be known as [[Thatcherism]].

Originally a chemist, then a [[barrister]], Thatcher became [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament (MP)]] for [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)|Finchley]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]]. During her time in Parliament, she heavily criticised the tax policies of the Labour Government. [[Edward Heath]] appointed Thatcher [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] in his 1970 government. In 1975 Thatcher became [[Leader of the Conservative Party]] (and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]), the first woman to head a major political party in the [[United Kingdom]]. After leading her party to victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] she became the UK's Prime Minister.

After entering {{nowrap|[[10 Downing Street]]}}, Thatcher was determined to reverse what she perceived as a precipitous national decline.{{#tag:ref|In her foreword to the 1979 Conservative manifesto, Thatcher wrote of "a feeling of helplessness, that a once great nation has somehow fallen behind".<ref>{{cite web |work=Foreword |title=Conservative Party Manifesto 1979 |url=http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1979/1979-conservative-manifesto.shtml |last=Thatcher |first=Margaret |publisher=conservativemanifesto.com|year=1979 |accessdate=28&nbsp;July 2009}}</ref>|group=nb}} Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised [[deregulation]], particularly of the financial sector, flexible labour markets, the sale or closure of [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned companies]], and the withdrawal of [[subsidy|subsidies]] to others. In her first few years in office, Thatcher's popularity waned amid recession and high unemployment, until economic recovery and the 1982 [[Falklands War]] brought a resurgence of support resulting in her re-election in 1983.

Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987, but her [[Community Charge]] was widely unpopular and her views on the [[European Union|European Community]] were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 after [[Michael Heseltine]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|challenge to her leadership of the Conservative Party]]. Thatcher holds a [[life peerage]] as Baroness Thatcher, of [[Kesteven]] in the County of Lincolnshire, which entitles her to sit in the [[House of Lords]].

==Early political career==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|February 1950]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|October 1951 general elections]] she campaigned for the safe Labour seat of [[Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)|Dartford]], where she attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate.<ref name="Beckett-p23">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|pp=23&ndash;24}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=37}}</ref> She lost both times to [[Norman Dodds]], but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000.<ref name="Beckett-p23"/> During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951.<ref name=Beckett-p23/><ref name="Denis Thatcher">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1434154/Sir-Denis-Thatcher-Bt.html|accessdate=6&nbsp;January 2012 |date=27&nbsp;June 2003 |title=Sir Denis Thatcher, Bt |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref> Denis funded his wife's studies for the [[bar association|bar]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=25}}</ref> she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blundell|2008|p=35}}</ref> That same year her twins, [[Carol Thatcher|Carol]] and [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]], were born.<ref name="Beckett-p26">{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=26}}</ref>

===Member of Parliament (1959<U+2013>1970)===
Thatcher began looking for a safe Conservative seat in the mid-1950s. She was narrowly rejected as the candidate for [[Orpington by-election, 1955|Orpington]] in 1955,<ref name="Beckett-p26"/> but was selected for Finchley in April 1958. She won the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election and was elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP).<ref>{{Harvnb|Beckett|2006|p=27}} See also: {{London Gazette |issue=41842 |startpage=6433 |date=13&nbsp;October 1959 |accessdate=28&nbsp;February 2008}}</ref> Her [[maiden speech]] was in support of her [[private member's bill]] ([[Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960]]), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of [[birching]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2000|p=134}}</ref>

In October 1961, Thatcher was promoted to the front bench as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions|Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance]] in [[Harold Macmillan]]'s administration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiten|2003|p=4}}</ref> After the loss of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] she became Conservative spokeswoman on Housing and Land, in which position she advocated her party's policy of allowing tenants to buy their [[council house]]s.<ref name="Wapshott-p64">{{Harvnb|Wapshott|2007|p=64}}</ref> She moved to the Shadow [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] team in 1966, and as Treasury spokeswoman opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, arguing that they would produce effects contrary to those intended and distort the economy.<ref name="Wapshott-p64"/>

At the Conservative Party Conference of 1966 she criticised the high-tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps "not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism".<ref name="Wapshott-p64"/> She argued that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work.<ref name="Wapshott-p64"/> Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support [[Leo Abse]]'s Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/05/sexual-offences-no-2|title=Sexual Offences (No. 2)|date=5&nbsp;July 1966|journal=Hansard|volume=731|page=267}}</ref> and voted in favour of [[David Steel]]'s Bill to legalise abortion,<ref name="Thatcher-p150"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jul/22/medical-termination-of-pregnancy-bill|title=Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill|date=22&nbsp;July 1966|journal=Hansard|volume=732|page=1165}}</ref> as well as a ban on [[hare coursing]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/14/hare-coursing-bill|title=Hare Coursing Bill|date=14 May 1970|journal=Hansard|volume=801|pages=1599&ndash;1603}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hare coursing attack; League Against Cruel Sports |newspaper=The Times |date=28&nbsp;February 1989}}</ref> She supported the retention of capital punishment<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/jun/24/capital-punishment|title=Capital Punishment|date=24&nbsp;June 1969|journal=Hansard|volume=785|page=1235}}</ref> and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1968/feb/09/divorce-reform-bill|title=Divorce Reform Bill|date=9&nbsp;February 1968|journal=Hansard|volume=758|pages=904&ndash;907}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1995|p=151}}</ref>

In 1967, she was selected by the [[U.S. Embassy, London|United States Embassy in London]] to take part in the [[International Visitor Leadership Program]] (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities, political figures, and institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott-Smith |first=Giles|title="Her Rather Ambitious Washington Program": Margaret Thatcher's International Visitor Program Visit to the United States in 1967|url=http://mountainrunner.us/library/publicdiplomacy/Scott-Smith%20(2003)-%20%E2%80%98Her%20Rather%20Ambitious%20Washington%20Program%E2%80%99%20Margaret%20Thatcher%E2%80%99s%20International%20Visitor%20Program%20Visit%20to%20the%20US%20in%201967.pdf|year= 2003 |journal=Contemporary British History|month= Winter|volume=17|issue=4|pages=65<U+2013>86|publisher=Routledge &ndash; Taylor and Francis|issn=1743<U+2013>7997|format = PDF}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Thatcher joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] later that year as Shadow Fuel spokesman.

===Education Secretary (1970<U+2013>1974)===

The Conservative party under Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was appointed [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]]. In her first months in office she attracted public attention as a result of the administration's attempts to cut spending. She gave priority to academic needs in schools,<ref name="Reitan-p14"/> and imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven.<ref name="Wapshott-p76">{{Harvnb|Wapshott|2007|p=76}}</ref> She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, but she agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily, for nutritional purposes.<ref name="Wapshott-p76"/> Her decision provoked a storm of protest from the Labour party and the press,<ref name="Reitan-p15">{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=15}}</ref> and led to the moniker "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher".<ref name="Wapshott-p76"/> Thatcher wrote in her autobiography: "I learned a valuable lesson [from the experience]. I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit."<ref name="Reitan-p15"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1995|p=182}}</ref>

Thatcher's term of office was marked by proposals for more local education authorities to close [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar schools]] and to adopt [[comprehensive school|comprehensive secondary education]]. Although she was committed to a tiered [[secondary modern]]-grammar school system of education, and determined to preserve grammar schools,<ref name="Reitan-p14">{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=14}}</ref> during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612&nbsp;proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensives rose from 32% to 62%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|pp=248<U+2013>249}}</ref>

[[File:Thatcher-loc.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Photograph|Margaret Thatcher, [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], 18&nbsp;September 1975]]

The Heath government continued to experience difficulties with [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargoes]] and union demands for wage increases in 1973, and was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]].<ref name="Reitan-p15"/> The Conservative result in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|general election of October 1974]] was even worse, and Thatcher mounted a challenge for the leadership of the party.<ref name="Reitan-p16">{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=16}}</ref> Promising a fresh start, her main support came from the Conservative [[1922 Committee]].<ref name="Reitan-p16"/> She [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975|defeated Heath]] on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article545321.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|title=Thatcher leads tributes to Sir Edward Heath|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=14 October 2008|work=The Times|first=Philippe|last=Naughton|location=London}}</ref> In the second ballot she defeated Heath's preferred successor, [[William Whitelaw]], and became party leader on 11 February 1975;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102452|title=Press Conference after winning Conservative leadership (Grand Committee Room)|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=29 September 2007}}</ref> she appointed Whitelaw as her deputy.

Thatcher began to attend lunches regularly at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] (IEA), a think tank founded by the  poultry magnate [[Antony Fisher]], a disciple of [[Friedrich von Hayek]]; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s.  There she was influenced by the ideas of [[Ralph Harris, Baron Harris of High Cross|Ralph Harris]] and [[Arthur Seldon]], and she became the face of the ideological movement opposing the [[welfare state]] [[Keynesian]] economics they believed was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beckett|2010|chapter=11}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2011}}

Thatcher began to work on her voice and screen image.<ref>{{cite news|author=Polly Dunbar |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055214/How-Laurence-Olivier-gave-Margaret-Thatcher-voice-went-history.html |title=How Laurence Olivier gave Margaret Thatcher the voice that went down in history &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref> The critic [[Clive James]], writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1977, compared her voice of 1973 to a cat sliding down a blackboard, but acknowledged her intelligence and mental agility.{{#tag:ref|"The hang-up has always been the voice.

On 19 January 1976 Thatcher made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the Soviet Union:

{{quote|The Russians are bent on world dominance, and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen. The men in the Soviet ''Politburo'' do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion. They put guns before butter, while we put just about everything before guns.<ref name="ironlady"/>}}

In response, the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' (''Red Star'') gave her the nickname "[[Iron Lady]]".<ref name="ironlady">{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=102939 |title=Britain Awake |accessdate=2&nbsp;November 2008 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation}}</ref> 

In mid-1978, the economy began to improve and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win appearing likely. Prime minister [[James Callaghan]] announced on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government as "chickens", and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Steel]] joined in, criticising Labour for "running scared".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/7/newsid_2502000/2502781.stm |title=7 September 1978: Callaghan accused of running scared |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 January 2012|year=2008|work=On this day 1950<U+2013>2005}}</ref>

The Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978<U+2013>79, popularly dubbed the "[[Winter of Discontent]]". The Conservatives attacked the Labour government's unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan ''Labour Isn't Working''. A [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] was called after [[James Callaghan]]'s government lost a [[1979 vote of no confidence against the government of James Callaghan|motion of no confidence]] in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and Margaret Thatcher became the UK's first female Prime Minister.

Thatcher became Prime Minister on 4 May 1979. Arriving at 10 Downing Street, she said, in a paraphrase of the "[[Prayer of Saint Francis]]":

{{quote|Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.}}

===Domestic affairs===
Thatcher was Prime Minister at a time of increased racial tension in Britain. Her standing in the polls rose by 11&nbsp;percent after she said in a TV interview during campaigning for the 1979 election: "The moment a minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened. The British character has done so much for democracy, for law, that if there is any fear that it might be swamped, people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in".<ref>{{cite news |magazine=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920566-3,00.html |title=Britain: Facing a Multiracial Future |date=27&nbsp;August 1979 |accessdate=20&nbsp;January 2011}}</ref> The Conservatives attracted voters from the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], whose support almost collapsed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FtAiLTYSpA4C&pg=PA128&dq=thatcher+national+front#v=onepage&q=thatcher%20national%20front&f=false |title=Britishness since 1870|first=Paul|last=Ward |publisher=Routledge|location=London|accessdate=21 August 2011|isbn=978-0-415-22016-3|year=2004}}</ref> ''The Economist'' noted "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties, specifically the National Front, which suffered a clear decline".<ref>''The Economist''. 14 May 1977.

====Economy and taxation====
Thatcher's economic policy was influenced by [[monetarism|monetarist]] thinking and economists such as [[Milton Friedman]].<ref name="Childs-p185">{{Harvnb|Childs|2006|p=185}}</ref> Together with [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Geoffrey Howe]], she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes.<ref name="Reitan-p30">{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|p=30}}</ref> She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thereby lower inflation,<ref name="Childs-p185"/> introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditures on social services such as education and housing.<ref name="Reitan-p30"/> Her cuts in higher education spending resulted in her being the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister not to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford, after a 738 to 319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/29/newsid_2506000/2506019.stm |title=29 January 1985: Thatcher snubbed by Oxford dons |accessdate=9 April 2007 |work=On this day 1950<U+2013>2005|publisher=BBC |year=2008}}</ref> Her new centrally-funded [[City Technology College]]s did not enjoy much success, and the Funding Agency for Schools was set up to control expenditure by opening and closing schools; the [[Social Market Foundation]], a right-wing think tank, described it as having "an extraordinary range of dictatorial powers".<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=464}}</ref>

Some Heathite Conservatives in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], the so-called "[[wets and dries|wets]]", expressed doubt over Thatcher's policies.<ref name="nft"/> The [[1981 England riots|1981 riots in England]] resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U-turn. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, Thatcher addressed the issue directly, with a speech written by the playwright [[Ronald Millar]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Jones|Kavanagh|Moran|2007|p=224}}</ref> that included the lines: "You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning!"<ref name="nft">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/10/newsid_2541000/2541071.stm |title=10 October 1980: Thatcher 'not for turning'|accessdate=21 December 2008 |publisher=BBC|work=On this day 1950<U+2013>2005 |year=2008}}</ref>

By 1987, unemployment was falling, the economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge87.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=11 June 1987 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>

Thatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing [[Rates (tax)|domestic rates]]<U+2014>a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home<U+2014>with the [[Community Charge]] (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident.<ref name="polltax">{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DD1030F930A15757C0A966958260 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=30&nbsp;October 2008 |date=23&nbsp;April 1990 |last=Passell |first=Peter |title=Furor Over British Poll Tax Imperils Thatcher Ideology}}</ref> The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year,<ref>{{Harvnb|Reitan|2003|pp=87<U+2013>88}}</ref> and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership.<ref name="polltax"/> Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000-strong demonstration in London on 31&nbsp;March 1990; the demonstration around [[Trafalgar Square]] deteriorated into the [[Poll Tax Riots]], leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest.<ref name="otd pt">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/31/newsid_2530000/2530763.stm |title=31 March 1990: Violence flares in poll tax demonstration|accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=On this day 1950<U+2013>2005|publisher=BBC|year=2008}}</ref>  The Community Charge was abolished by her successor, [[John Major]].<ref name="otd pt"/>

====Industrial relations====
Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions, whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through strike action.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1993|pp=97<U+2013>98, 339<U+2013>340}}</ref> Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to curb their power, but resistance eventually collapsed.<ref name="thatcher-cw">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/thatcher/ |title=Margaret Thatcher |accessdate=29&nbsp;October 2008 |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080703072749/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/thatcher/ |archivedate=3&nbsp;July 2008}}</ref> Only 39% of union members voted for Labour in the 1983 general election.<ref>{{cite news |last=Revzin |first=Philip |title=British Labor Unions Begin to Toe the Line, Realizing That the Times Have Changed |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=23&nbsp;November 1984}}</ref> According to the BBC, Thatcher "managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation".<ref name="bbcstrike">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3067563.stm |title=Enemies within: Thatcher and the unions |accessdate=29&nbsp;October 2008 |date=5&nbsp;March 2004 |last=Wilenius |first=Paul |work=BBC News}}</ref>

The [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]] was the biggest confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government. In March 1984 the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174&nbsp;state-owned mines and cut 20,000&nbsp;jobs out of 187,000.<ref name=Glass>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Glass|title=The Uncivilized Side of Britain Rears its Ugly Head|newspaper=The Record |date=16&nbsp;December 1984|page=37}}</ref><ref name=Black>{{cite news |last=Black |first=Dave |title=Still unbowed, ex-miners to mark 25&nbsp;years since the start of the strike |newspaper=The Journal |date=21&nbsp;February 2009 |page=19}}</ref><ref name="pits-closed"/> Two-thirds of the country's miners, led by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) under [[Arthur Scargill]], downed tools in protest.<ref name=Glass/><ref name="thatcher-num">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/3537463.stm |title=Iron Lady versus union baron |accessdate=20&nbsp;November 2008 |date=6&nbsp;March 2004 |last=Hannan |first=Patrick |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=Jones>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Jones|title=A History of the Miners' Strike|work=Press Association National Newswire|date=3&nbsp;March 2009}}</ref> Thatcher refused to meet the union's demands and compared the miners' dispute to the Falklands conflict two years earlier, declaring in a speech in 1984: "We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands.

The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4583 in 1979, when more than 29&nbsp;million working days were lost. In 1984, the year of the miners' strike, there were 1221, resulting in the loss of more than 27&nbsp;million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2&nbsp;million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter.<ref name=ButlerButlerP375>{{Harvnb|Butler|Butler|1994|p=375}}</ref> Trade union membership also fell, from 13.5&nbsp;million in 1979 to fewer than 10&nbsp;million by the time Thatcher left office in 1990.<ref name=EvansP40>{{Harvnb|Evans|2004|p=40}}</ref>

====Privatisation====
[[File:Margaret Thatcher visiting Salford.jpg|thumb|right|Thatcher on a visit to the [[University of Salford]], 1982]]
The policy of [[privatisation]] has been called "a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism".<ref>{{Harvnb|Seldon|Collings|2000|p=27}}</ref> After the 1983 election the sale of state utilities accelerated;<ref>{{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|Henig|Hamnett|1998|p=71}}</ref> more than <U+00A3>29&nbsp;billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another <U+00A3>18&nbsp;billion from the sale of council houses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=428}}</ref>

The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of [[workforce productivity|labour productivity]].<ref name=ParkerMartin>{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=David |last2=Martin |first2=Stephen |title=The impact of UK privatisation on labour and total factor productivity |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |volume=42 |issue=2 |date=May 1995 |pages=216<U+2013>217}}</ref>  Some of the privatised industries including gas, water, and electricity, were [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement often did so while still under state ownership. [[British Steel]], for instance, made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed chairmanship of Ian MacGregor, who faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and reduce the workforce by half.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=M. W. |year=2006 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69687 |contribution=MacGregor, Sir Ian Kinloch (1912<U+2013>1998)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=online |format={{ODNBsub}} |accessdate=24&nbsp;November 2009}}</ref> Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies like [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets|Ofgas]], [[Oftel]] and the [[National Rivers Authority]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Veljanovski|1990|pp=291<U+2013>304}}</ref> There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries;<ref name=ParkerMartin/> in most cases privatisation benefitted consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall were "mixed".<ref name=McAleese>{{Harvnb|McAleese|2004|pp=169<U+2013>170}}</ref>

Thatcher always resisted rail privatisation, and was said to have told Transport Secretary [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]] "Railway privatisation will be the Waterloo of this government. Please never mention the railways to me again." Shortly before her resignation, she accepted the arguments for privatising [[British Rail]], which her successor John Major implemented in 1994.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=495}}</ref> ''The Economist'' later considered the move to have been "a disaster".<ref name="McAleese"/>

The privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation in an attempt to fuel economic growth. Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain's exchange controls in 1979, allowing more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] of 1986 removed many restrictions on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The Thatcher government encouraged growth in the finance and service sectors to compensate for Britain's ailing manufacturing industry. 

====Northern Ireland====
In 1981, [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze Prison]] began [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|a hunger strike]] in an effort to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed five years earlier under the preceding Labour government.<ref name="strike"/> [[Bobby Sands]] began the strike, saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions.<ref name="strike">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/3/newsid_2451000/2451503.stm |title=3 October 1981: IRA Maze hunger strikes at an end |publisher=BBC|work=On this day 1950<U+2013>2005 |year=2008}}</ref> Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners, declaring "Crime is crime is crime; it is not political",<ref name="strike"/> but nevertheless the UK government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6036723.ece|title=Was Gerry Adams complicit over hunger strikers? |accessdate=20&nbsp;April 2009 |date=5&nbsp;April 2009 |newspaper=Sunday Times |last=Clarke |first=Liam |location=London}}</ref>  After the deaths of Sands and nine others, some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of their political status.<ref name="CAIN-hs"/> Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes; in 1982 [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] politician [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]] described Thatcher as "the biggest bastard we have ever known".<ref>{{Harvnb|English|2005|pp=207<U+2013>208}}</ref>

Thatcher took office in the penultimate decade of the [[Cold War]] and became closely aligned with the policies of United States President [[Ronald Reagan]], based on their shared distrust of Communism,<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> although she strongly opposed Reagan's October 1983 [[invasion of Grenada]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gilbert|2002|p=565}}</ref> During her first year as Prime Minister she supported [[NATO]]'s decision to deploy US nuclear [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|cruise]] and [[MGM-31 Pershing|Pershing missile]]s in Western Europe,<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> and permitted the US to station more than 160&nbsp;cruise missiles at [[RAF Greenham Common]], starting on 14&nbsp;November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name="thatcher-cw"/> She bought the [[UK Trident programme|Trident]] nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922079,00.html |title=Trident is go |accessdate=16&nbsp;January 2011 |date=28&nbsp;July 1980 |magazine=Time}}</ref> at an eventual cost of more than <U+00A3>12&nbsp;billion (at 1996<U+2013>97 prices).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/uk/slbm/vanguard.htm |title=Vanguard Class Ballistic Missile Submarine |accessdate=16&nbsp;January 2011 |date=5&nbsp;November 1999 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref> Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the [[Westland affair]] of January 1986, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]] to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm [[Agusta]] in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]].

Although saying that she was against [[apartheid]], Thatcher stood against the sanctions imposed on [[South Africa]] by the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[European Community|EC]].<ref>Campbell, J., Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady, Random House, 2011, p.322.</ref> She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the regime there to abandon apartheid.

The Thatcher government supported the [[Khmer Rouge]] keeping their seat in the UN after they were ousted from power in Cambodia by the [[Cambodian<U+2013>Vietnamese War]].

Thatcher's antipathy towards [[European integration]] became more pronounced during her premiership, particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in [[Bruges]] she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the [[European Union]], for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107332 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=31&nbsp;October 2008 |date=20&nbsp;September 1988 |title=Speech to the College of Europe ("The Bruges Speech")}}</ref> Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 national referendum]],<ref name="upi19750604">{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M7QsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lQoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2825%2C608551 | title=Conservatives favor remaining in market | work=Wilmington Morning Star | date=4 June 1975 | agency=UPI | accessdate=26 December 2011 | page=5}}</ref> but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation;<ref name="Senden-p9"/> in 1988, she remarked, "We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels".<ref name="Senden-p9">{{Harvnb|Senden|2004|p=9}}</ref> Thatcher was firmly opposed to the UK's membership of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy,<ref name="ecc">{{cite news |title=Thatcher stands firm against full EMS role |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106969 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=8&nbsp;October 2008 |last=Riddell |first=Peter |date=23&nbsp;November 1987 |newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref> despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Nigel Lawson]] and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Thatcher|1993|p=712}}</ref> but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=484}}</ref>

Thatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Following Reagan<U+2013>Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that "We're not in a Cold War now", but rather in a "new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was".<ref name="reforms1988">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1738F93BA25752C1A96E948260|title= Gorbachev Policy Has Ended The Cold War, Thatcher Says|date=18 November 1988|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref> She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984, and met with Gorbachev and [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].<ref>{{cite book | last1=Zemtsov |first1=Ilya |last2=Farrar |first2=John |title=Gorbachev: The Man and the System |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4128-0717-3 |page=138}}</ref> Thatcher was initially opposed to [[German reunification]], telling Gorbachev that it "would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security".

In the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2001|Conservative leadership election]] shortly after, she supported Smith over Kenneth Clarke.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter supporting Iain Duncan Smith for the Conservative leadership published in the ''Daily Telegraph'' |date=21&nbsp;August 2001 |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108390 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=9&nbsp;April 2007}}</ref>

In March 2002, Thatcher's book ''[[Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World]]'', dedicated to Ronald Reagan, was released. In it, she claimed there would be no peace in the Middle East until [[Saddam Hussein]] was toppled, that Israel must trade land for peace, and that the European Union (EU) was "fundamentally unreformable", "a classic utopian project, a monument to the vanity of intellectuals, a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure". She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the [[North American Free Trade Area]]. The book was serialised in ''The Times'' on 18 March.

Thatcher suffered several small strokes in 2002 and was advised by her doctors not to engage in any more public speaking.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Statement from the office of the Rt Hon Baroness Thatcher LG OM FRS |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=22&nbsp;March 2002|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109305 |accessdate=9&nbsp;November 2008}}</ref>  On 23 March she announced that on the advice of her doctors she would cancel all planned speaking engagements and accept no more.<ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|2003|pp=796<U+2013>798}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{Thatcherism}}
Thatcher remains identified with her remarks to the reporter Douglas Keay, for ''[[Woman's Own]]'' magazine in September 1987:

{{quote|I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" or "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview for Woman's Own ("no such thing as society") with journalist Douglas Keay |date=23&nbsp;September 1987 |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106689 |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |accessdate=10&nbsp;April 2007}}</ref>}}

To her supporters, Margaret Thatcher remains a figure who revitalised Britain's economy, impacted the trade unions, and re-established the nation as a world power.<ref name="legacy-bbc">{{cite news |title=Evaluating Thatcher's legacy |date=4 May 2004 |accessdate=1 November 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3681973.stm|work=BBC News}}</ref> She oversaw an increase from 7% to 25% of adults owning shares, and more than a million families bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55% to 67% in owner-occupiers.

Victory in the Falklands conflict and her strong alliance with the United States are also remembered as some of her greatest achievements.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm | work=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>

Thatcher's premiership was also marked by high unemployment and social unrest,<ref name="legacy-bbc"/> and many critics fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by high unemployment as a result of her [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies<ref>{{cite web|author=Susie Boniface |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/10/24/george-osborne-wreaks-havoc-just-like-margaret-thatcher-in-1980s-115875-22654756/ |title=George Osborne wreaks havoc .. just like Margaret Thatcher in 1980s |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2011}} have still not fully recovered and are also blighted by social problems including drug abuse and family breakdown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richards|2004|p=63}}</ref> Speaking in Scotland in April 2009, before the 30th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister, Thatcher insisted she had no regrets, and was right to introduce the poll tax and to remove subsidies from "outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline" which had created "the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain".<ref>{{cite news |title=Thatcher: I did right by Scots; Thatcher: I regret nothing|newspaper=Sunday Times |date=26&nbsp;April 2009 |page=1|first=Jason|last=Allardyce  }}</ref> Political economist [[Susan Strange]] called the new financial growth model "casino capitalism", reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gamble|2009|p=16}}</ref>

Thatcher often referred after the war to the "Falklands Spirit"; Hastings and Jenkins (1983) suggested that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision-making of her [[War Cabinet#Falklands War, 1982|War Cabinet]] over the painstaking deal-making of peace-time [[cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet government]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hastings|Jenkins|1983|p=329}}</ref>

Critics have regretted Thatcher's influence in the abandonment of [[full employment]], poverty reduction and a consensual civility as bedrock policy objectives. Many recent biographers have been critical of aspects of the Thatcher years and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]], writing in ''[[New Statesman]]'' in February 2009, challenged the view that her reforms had brought a net benefit.<ref>"Who was it who first removed the seat belts and airbags from the safe-but-boring Volvo that the West built after 1945?

The term "[[Thatcherism]]" came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style, including [[moral absolutism]], [[British nationalism|nationalism]], interest in the individual, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.{{#tag:ref|[[Nigel Lawson]] listed the Thatcherite ideals as: "Free markets, financial discipline, firm control over public expenditure, tax cuts, nationalism, 'Victorian values' (of the [[Samuel Smiles]] self-help variety), privatization and a dash of populism." {{Harvnb|Lawson|1992|p=64}}|group=nb}} Influenced at the outset by [[Keith Joseph]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=358}}</ref> Thatcherism remains a potent byword in British political parlance, with both [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] defining policies in post-Thatcherite terms, and [[David Cameron]] saying after a dinner with Thatcher in February 2009: "You have got to do the right thing even if it is painful. Don't trim or track all over the place. Set your course and take the difficult decisions because that is what needs to be done&nbsp;...

In 2011, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] praised some of Thatcher's key policies, stating: "Some of what happened in the 1980s was right. It was right to let people buy their council houses. It was right to cut tax rates of 60, 70, 80 per cent. And it was right to change the rules on the closed shop, on strikes before ballots.

===Media depictions===
{{main|Cultural depictions of Margaret Thatcher}}
Margaret Thatcher has been depicted in a number of television programmes, documentaries, films and plays.  She was played by [[Patricia Hodge]] in [[Ian Curteis]]'s long unproduced ''[[The Falklands Play]]'' (2002) and by [[Andrea Riseborough]] in the TV film ''[[The Long Walk to Finchley]]'' (2008).  She is the titular character in two films, portrayed by [[Lindsay Duncan]] in ''[[Margaret (2009 film)|Margaret]]'' (2009) and by [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'' (2011),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12393674 |title=Image of Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher unveiled |accessdate=9 February 2011|date=8 February 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> in which she is depicted as having [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/12/22/the-iron-lady-draws-fire-for-depicting-thatcher-with-alzheimers/</ref>

Thatcher was lampooned by satirist [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] in several media. Wells collaborated with [[Richard Ingrams]] on the spoof "[[Dear Bill]]" letters which ran as a column in ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine, were published in book form, and were then adapted into a West End stage revue as ''Anyone for Denis?'', starring Wells as Denis Thatcher. The stage show was followed by a [[Anyone for Denis? (TV version)|1982 TV special]] directed by [[Dick Clement]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Anyone for Denis? |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/4789 |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=19&nbsp;January 2011}}</ref> In 1979, Wells was commissioned by comedy producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] to write and perform on a comedy record album titled ''Iron Lady: The Coming Of The Leader'' on which Thatcher was portrayed by comedienne and noted Thatcher impersonator [[Janet Brown]]. The album consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power.

In ''[[Spitting Image#Politicians|Spitting Image]]'', Thatcher was portrayed as a bullying tyrant, wearing trousers, and ridiculing her own ministers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marr|2007|p=417}}</ref>

===Protest songs===
Thatcher was the subject or the inspiration for a number of [[protest song]]s. [[Paul Weller]] was a founding member of [[Red Wedge]] collective, which unsuccessfully sought to oust Thatcher with the help of music. In 1987, they organised a comedy tour with British comedians [[Lenny Henry]], [[Ben Elton]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Harry Enfield]] and others.<ref Name="Songs">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3682281.stm|title=Rocking against Thatcher|work=BBC News|date=4 May 2004|last=Heard|first=Chris}}</ref>
