'''Bob Fullam''' (born [[Ringsend]] 1897 &ndash; died [[London]] 1974) was one of the best-known [[association footballer]]s in the [[League of Ireland]] in the 1920s.  A versatile attacking player, he was skilful but also had a tough-man image.  

He worked as a docker in Dublin, and played for [[Shelbourne F.C.]] 1918-21, winning the [[Irish Cup]] in 1920.  He then transferred to [[Shamrock Rovers]], and played in the inaugural [[Free State Cup]] final in 1922.  In that match, his skirmishes with Charlie Dowdall of eventual champions [[St. James's Gate F.C.]] helped provoke post-match disturbances involving players and supporters. This led to a ban for the start of the following season.  Nevertheless, he finished top scorer with 27 goals in 22 games, as Rovers won their first League title. He transferred to [[Leeds United]] for 1923-24 but played only seven games. He returned to Rovers the next season, helping them to [[the Double]], as "give it to Bob" became a Dublin catchphrase.  In the 1926 Cup final, he famously pulled out of a goalmouth challenge, sacrificing a goal (and the Cup) to prevent injuring the [[Fordsons F.C.]] goalkeeper. 

Fullam played in the first-ever [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish Free State international side]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Turin]] in 1926; in the return match against Italy in 1927, he scored the team's first-ever international goal.  As he was now 30, and the selectors had a preference for young players, this second cap was his last.  He continued to play for Shamrock Rovers into the early 1930s.

His time at [[Milltown]] was littered with medals. He won the League and the [[FAI Cup]] 4 times scoring 92 league goals and 9 Cup goals as we as 6 Inter-League caps.
