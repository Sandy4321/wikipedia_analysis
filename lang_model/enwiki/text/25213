'''Vala Mal Doran''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the Canadian-American [[military science fiction]] television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', a science fiction show about a military team exploring the galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices. Played by former ''[[Farscape]]'' actress [[Claudia Black]], Vala was created by [[Damian Kindler]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] as a guest character for the [[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)|season 8]] episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)#ep166|Prometheus Unbound]]" (2004). Because of the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala and [[Michael Shanks]]' character [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]], and the character's popularity with the producers and the audience, Claudia Black became a recurring guest star in [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|season 9]] (2005&ndash;2006) and joined the main cast in [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|season 10]] (2006&ndash;2007).

"Prometheus Unbound" introduces Vala as a sexy and mischievous human with a [[Goa'uld]] background from an unnamed planet. In season 9, Vala and Daniel set off the arc of the show's new villain race, the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. After giving birth to the Ori's new leader in season 10, Vala joins the [[Stargate SG-1|SG-1]] team to stop the enemy. Claudia Black resumed her role in the 2008 direct-to-DVD film ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'', which finishes the Ori arc. Black also appeared as Vala and her Goa'uld alter ego [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Qetesh|Qetesh]] in the 2008 film ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]''. She will, however, not be returning for the announced third ''Stargate SG-1'' direct-to-DVD film that is scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009.<ref name=jm_090102 /> For her portrayal of Vala, Claudia Black was nominated for a 2006 [[Saturn Award]] in the category "[[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television|Best Supporting Actress on Television]]", and won a Constellation Award in the category "Best Female Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Television" in 2007.

===Character arc===
Information about Vala's past is revealed over the course of several episodes of seasons 8 through 10 of ''Stargate SG-1''. "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep18|Family Ties]]" gives insight into Vala's background with her father Jacek, a [[Confidence trick|con artist]] who had left her and her mother to pursue his scams. As mentioned in "[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]", Vala also had a stepmother named Adria, whom she held in little regard.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Family Ties | episodelink = Family Ties (Stargate SG-1) | series = Stargate SG-1 | serieslink =Stargate SG-1 | credits = [[Peter DeLuise]] | writers = [[Joseph Mallozzi]] & [[Paul Mullie]] | network = [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] | season = 10 | number = 18}}

In the season 9 opener "[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]", Vala seeks out Daniel at [[Stargate Program#Stargate Command|Stargate Command]]. Needing his linguistic skills, she uses a [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Weapons and military|Kor mak bracelet]] to bind them together for a treasure hunt on Earth. The discovery of an [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Communication device with stones|Ancient communication device]] transports Vala's and Daniel's minds to a village in a distant galaxy where the local villagers kill Vala in a [[Trial by ordeal|trial by fire]], but a [[Ori (Stargate)#Priors|Prior]], a servant of a race named the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], resurrects her.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Avalon | episodelink = Avalon (Stargate SG-1) | series = Stargate SG-1 | serieslink =Stargate SG-1 | credits = [[Andy Mikita]] | writers = [[Robert C.

===Characterization===
Official ''Stargate'' sources advertised Vala as a "scheming, unscrupulous, thieving con artist",<ref name=scifisite /> "feisty" and "occasionally fickle",<ref name=sg_mag_april07 /> with a "mysterious agenda" and a seemingly "amorous interest in Dr. Daniel Jackson".<ref name=scifisite>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/stargate/cast/vala/index.html |title="Vala &ndash; Claudia Black" |publisher=scifi.com |accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080113143250/http://www.scifi.com/stargate/cast/vala/index.html |archivedate = January 13, 2008}}</ref> Genre magazine ''[[TV Zone]]'' subtitled Vala as a "thief, arms dealer, mercenary" who, when given an inch, will "take a mile, and whatever else she can get her hands on."<ref name=tvzones64_6>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=SG-1/Atlantis &ndash; The characters |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 64 |pages=6&ndash;11 |date=July 2005}}</ref> ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' described Vala as a "mischievous minx",<ref name=SFX_137>{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=Thomasina | title=Claudia Black |journal=SFX |issue=137 |date=December 2005}}</ref> whereas ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' interpreted Vala as "ethically challenged".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060714/news_lz1c14tvbets.html |title="TV &ndash; July 14, 2006" |publisher=''The San Diego Union-Tribune'' |date=July 14, 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref> Steven Eramo of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' gave Vala the attributes "sexy, smart and always resourceful".<ref name=starbursts76>{{cite journal|last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=The New Black |journal=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |issue=Special 76 |pages=82&ndash;88 |date=July 2006}}</ref> Claudia Black characterized early Vala as "sassy", "intelligent", "manipulative", and "mercurial", but found it "very hard to tell what the real core of Vala is."<ref name=scifi_black_guests>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2004-09/22/12.15.sfc |title=Black Guests On Stargate |publisher=scifi.com |date=September 22, 2004 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050305185338/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2004-09/22/12.15.sfc |archivedate = March 5, 2005}}</ref> Black later described Vala as "a new, weird element", "irritating",<ref name=gw_i_claudia>{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/i_claudia.shtml |title=I, Claudia &ndash; GateWorld talks with Claudia Black |publisher=''[[Stargate fandom#GateWorld|GateWorld]]'' |month=July | year=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref> "very vibrant",<ref name=gw_black_back /> "sort of the hair-pulling variety", "really infuriating" and "[hopefully] funny".<ref name=scifi_browder_black>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=30979 |title=Black, Browder Talk New SG-1 |publisher=scifi.com |date=May 6, 2005 |accessdate=2008-01-13}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref> With Vala being a departure from Black's former ''Farscape'' role as [[Aeryn Sun]], Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who "says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say",<ref name=scifi_browder_black /> although both characters share "being damaged goods [in the beginning] and on a path to becoming a better person".<ref name=starbursts76 /> Robert C.

===Relationships===
Claudia Black and [[Michael Shanks]] (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early relationship to a [[Spencer Tracy]]/[[Katharine Hepburn]] dynamic of "not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism".<ref name=SFX_137 /><ref name=tvzones64_40 /><ref name=verbatim>{{cite journal | title=Black To The Future |journal=Verbatim |issue=8 |date=October 2005}}</ref> Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel that he had not had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial.<ref name=SFX_137 /><ref name=tvzones64_40>{{cite journal|last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Michael Shanks &ndash; Curious Mind |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 64 |pages=40&ndash;42 |date=July 2005}}</ref> The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry.<ref name=ac_1018 /> Michael Shanks stated that by "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep202|Memento Mori]]", "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue."<ref name=tvzones71_20>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Actress Amanda Tapping &ndash; Woman of Substance |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 71 |pages=20&ndash;23 |date=July 2006}}</ref> From Black's point of view, Daniel offers "an interesting window" into "Vala's external fa<U+00E7>ade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel."<ref name=tvzones71_28>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Actor Michael Shanks &ndash; Cause and Effect |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 71 |pages=28&ndash;31 |date=July 2006}}</ref> Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry.<ref name=scifiworld /> When producer [[Robert C. Cooper]] presented his preliminary script for the series finale, "[[Unending]]", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that "[t]here's always been this underlining, keeping [Vala] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close."<ref name=gw_turn /> After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.<ref name=gw_turn>{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/turn_of_the_page.shtml |title=Turn Of The Page &ndash; GateWorld talks with Michael Shanks |publisher=''[[Stargate fandom#GateWorld|GateWorld]]'' |month=June | year=2007 |accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

Describing Vala's attitude towards bonding with other characters as "in a strange way quite level-headed" and "quite honest",<ref name=gw_i_claudia /> Black interpreted Vala's behavior as a reaction to growing attached to people where the relationships never seem to work out.<ref name=tvzones74_40 /> Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of [[Stargate Program#Stargate Command|Stargate Command]] about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she "has reached a point of honesty with [the SG-1] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before."<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Robert C. Cooper]] |date=2006 |title=Director Series &ndash; "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep193|Crusade]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref> From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying.<ref name=tvzones71_20 /> A scene in "Morpheus" that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep18|Family Ties]]" would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances.<ref name=dvd_delscene /><ref>{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/a_decade_with_sam.shtml |title=A Decade With Sam &ndash; GateWorld Talks with Amanda Tapping |publisher=''[[Stargate fandom#GateWorld|GateWorld]]'' |month=May | year=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref> By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior [[Teal'c]] as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up.<ref name=tvzones71_24>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Actor Christopher Judge &ndash; Out of the Box |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 74 |pages=24&ndash;27 |date=July 2006}}</ref> The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by [[Ben Browder]]) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well-known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series ''[[Farscape]]''.<ref name=scifi_browder_black /><ref name=tvzones71_40 />

According to Black, Vala's motivation to hide her miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager [[Ori (Stargate)#Tomin|Tomin]] (played by [[Tim Guinee]]) in late season 9 stems from "genuinely car[ing] for the man. She does something wrong, but she must in order to survive."<ref name=tvguide060227 /> Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination.<ref name=gw_i_claudia /> Throughout season 10, Vala has to come to terms with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by [[Morena Baccarin]]), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought.<ref name=tvzones71_28 /> Black believed Vala had to "try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her", despite her own lack of maturity.<ref name=starbursts76 /> When Vala meets her father Jacek ([[Fred Willard]]) in "Family Ties", Vala shows "a slightly more dramatic and vulnerable side" that was new to the audience.<ref name=tvzones74_40 />

==Conceptual history==
===Creation and casting===
''Stargate SG-1'' supervising producer [[Damian Kindler]] wrote "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)#ep166|Prometheus Unbound]]" as a [[Second unit|second-unit]] [[bottle episode]] for the middle of ''Stargate SG-1''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> season 8 in 2004.<ref name=gw_sanctuary /> The main cast's availability was limited, as [[Richard Dean Anderson]] had a reduced season schedule, and [[Amanda Tapping]] and [[Christopher Judge]] filmed "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 8)#ep165|Gemini]]" in parallel to "Prometheus Unbound".<ref name=ac_904>{{cite video |people=[[Peter Woeste]] and [[John G. Lenic]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "[[Zero Hour (Stargate SG-1)|Zero Hour]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref><ref name=ac_812 /> Kindler therefore centered the episode on [[Michael Shanks]]' character [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] and created Vala, a human character from an unnamed planet, as Daniel's one-episode adversary. Not fully content with Kindler's conservative approach, producer [[Robert C. Cooper]] amplified the character's cheeky and sexy personality in his own passes of the script. Although Cooper tried to respect ''Stargate SG-1''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> reputation as a sex-free family show, he was aware that the character's sexiness might cause a strong audience reaction.<ref name=gw_sanctuary>{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/visions_of_sanctuary.shtml |title=Visions of Sanctuary &ndash; GateWorld talks with Damian Kindler |publisher=''[[Stargate fandom#GateWorld|GateWorld]]'' |month=March | year=2007 |accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref><ref name=ac_901>{{cite video |people=[[Robert C.

===Development===
With actor Richard Dean Anderson's departure from the show in 2005, ''Stargate SG-1'' saw cast changes at the beginning of season 9.

Cooper]] and [[Peter Woeste]] |date=2006 |title=Audio Commentary for "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep193|Crusade]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref> The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint the audience with the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons.<ref name=sg_mag_april07 /><ref name=starbursts76 /><ref name=gw_i_claudia />

Because Ben Browder and Claudia Black were well-known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series ''[[Farscape]]'', the ''Stargate'' producers refrained from emphasizing the pairing of Mitchell and Vala beyond in-jokes.<ref name=scifi_browder_black /><ref name=injoke>Upon meeting Mitchell for the first time in the season 9 premiere "[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]", Vala remarks "I know we haven't met. That I'm sure I would remember." The episode "[[200 (Stargate SG-1)|200]]" features a short parody segment where Vala imagines the SG-1 members playing various ''[[Farscape]]'' characters. Vala plays Black's old role of [[List of Farscape characters#Aeryn Sun|Aeryn Sun]], while Mitchell (Browder) plays the ''Farscape'' character [[List of Farscape characters#Stark|Stark]]. Daniel (Shanks) plays Browder's old role of [[List of Farscape characters#John Crichton|John Crichton]].</ref> The producers instead opted to further the comedic chemistry between Claudia Black and Michael Shanks, who linked their characters' early relationship to a [[Spencer Tracy]]/[[Katharine Hepburn]] dynamic of "not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism".<ref name=SFX_137 /><ref name=tvzones64_40 /><ref name=verbatim>{{cite journal |title=Black To The Future |journal=Verbatim |issue=8 |date=October 2005}}</ref> Mirroring Vala's sexiness in season 8, "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep179|The Powers That Be]]" writer [[Martin Gero]] chose [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Qetesh|Qetesh]], the Egyptian Goddess of Love and Beauty, as a fitting former [[Goa'uld]] identity for Vala.<ref name=ac_905 /> Nevertheless, Black and the producers refrained from portraying the character as too sexually manipulative. A scene from "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep178|The Ties That Bind]]", which was later cut for time, originally made clear that [[Wallace Shawn]]'s character greatly exaggerated the sexual relationship between him and Vala.<ref name=gw_i_claudia /> Claudia Black was brought back into the show for the last two episodes of season 9, at which time the actress was seven months pregnant.<ref name="crusade commentary" /> Producer [[Robert C. Cooper]], who wrote and directed "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep193|Crusade]]", used the circumstances to set the stage for [[Ori (Stargate)#Adria|Adria]], Vala's future daughter and the show's new villain in season 10.<ref name=tvguide060227>{{cite journal |last=Rudolph |first=Illeane |title=Black Is Back |journal=[[TV Guide]] |issue=February 27 &ndash; March 5, 2006 |pages=41 |date=February 27, 2006}}</ref>

Claudia Black joined the cast full time in season 10. Had ''Stargate SG-1'' not been picked up for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series.<ref name=gw_i_claudia /> To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and tried to find a suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Spelling |first=Ian |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=36404 |title=SG-1's Shanks Talks Romance |publisher=scifi.com |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808034024/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=36404 |archivedate = August 8, 2007}}</ref> Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep180|Beachhead]]", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy.<ref name=gw_i_claudia /> The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer [[Damian Kindler]] later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler [[Lando Calrissian]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', a "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth."<ref name=gw_sanctuary /> Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them "end[ing] up in a motel room bed together" in the episode "Memento Mori", involving underwear, "handcuffs as well as creamy [[Twinkie]]s".<ref name=tvzones71_40>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Preview Season 10 |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 74 |pages=40&ndash;52 |date=July 2006}}</ref> A scene in the milestone episode "[[200 (Stargate SG-1)|200]]" also parodied the show's connection to ''Farscape''.<ref name=injoke /> In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period.<ref name=tvzones74_40>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Actress Claudia Black &ndash; Vala-ble Ally |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 74 |pages=40&ndash;42 |date=January 2007}}</ref> Her relocation to [[Vancouver]] and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low.<ref name=tvzone226>{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Actress Claudia Black &ndash; Latch and Hatch |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=226 |pages=60&ndash;66 |date=March 2008}}</ref> She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character "and not go for the cheap laugh".<ref name=tvzones74_40 />

After a miscarriage scare during the filming of the first direct-to-DVD ''SG-1'' film, ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'', Claudia Black's work on the film ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' was limited on strict doctor's orders.<ref name=tvzone226 /> Although Black considered ''Continuum'' "not a Vala-centric piece" as she only "makes a brief appearance",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2007/07/15/slice-of-scifi-interview-with-claudia-black/ |title=Slice of SciFi Interview With Claudia Black |publisher=sliceofscifi.com |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> ''Stargate'' producer [[Joseph Mallozzi]] thought "she's got some great, juicy scenes".<ref name=jm_blog_080110>{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/january-10-2008-a-mix-and-the-mailbag/ |title=Joseph Mallozzi's Weblog &ndash; January 10, 2008 &ndash; A Mix and the Mailbag |publisher=josephmallozzi.wordpress.com |date=January 10, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Claudia Black mentioned an interest in portraying her character in the future,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_02.htm |title=Claudia Black interview (2) |publisher=thescifiworld.net |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> but Mallozzi rated the chances of her appearing in the planned ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' spin-off series as "not so good".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2007/08/19/august-19-2007/ |title=Joseph Mallozzi's Weblog &ndash; August 19, 2007 |publisher=josephmallozzi.wordpress.com |date=August 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Producer [[Brad Wright]] announced that Vala would not be returning for the announced third ''Stargate SG-1'' direct-to-DVD film that is scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009.<ref name=jm_090102>{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/january-2-2009-brad-wright-answers-your-questions/ |title=January 2, 2009: Brad Wright Answers Your Questions |publisher=josephmallozzi.wordpress.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> Claudia Black is the only ''SG-1'' main cast member besides [[Corin Nemec]] (playing [[Jonas Quinn]] between ''SG-1''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> season 5 and 7) and [[Ben Browder]] (playing [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] from season 9 onward) who never appeared in ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', although Vala is mentioned by [[Rodney McKay]] (played by [[David Hewlett]]) in the ''Atlantis'' season 5 episode "[[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)#ep98|Identity]]".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Identity | episodelink = Identity (Stargate Atlantis) | series = Stargate Atlantis | serieslink = Stargate Atlantis | credits = [[Will Waring]] | writers = [[Carl Binder]] | network = [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] | season = 5 | number = 18}}

===Costumes and make-up===
Claudia Black made her entrance in ''Stargate SG-1'' in a full-body [[Kull Warrior]] costume, not dissimilar to her first appearance as a [[Peacekeepers (Farscape)|Peacekeeper]] in ''[[Farscape]]''.<ref name=ac_812 /> For her entrance in season 9's "[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]", however, the costume designers intended her to wear a dress that the producers later deemed too revealing. Leaving the dress for Vala's appearance as Qetesh in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep179|The Powers That Be]]", Vala's outfit for "Avalon" was switched to a black fetish leather gear which a costume designer described as "a dominatrix outfit".<ref name=ac_905 /><ref name=ultimate /> Black admitted the wildness of her "Avalon" wardrobe was not for her liking. But since it mirrored the [[Attention seeking|attention-seeking]] personality of the character, and because the character does not spend much time in the same outfit anyway, the actress did not mind wearing it.<ref name=ultimate>{{cite journal |title=Black Is Back |journal=Ultimate DVD |date=April 2006}}</ref> 

Vala started wearing the normal [[Stargate Program#Command structure|SG team]] uniform in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep177|Origin]]", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later included in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep178|The Ties That Bind]]" and her shopping tour outfit in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep18|Family Ties]]". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot.<ref name=SFX_137 /><ref name=ac_1018>{{cite video |people=[[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Paul Mullie]] |date=2007 |title=Audio Commentary for "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep18|Family Ties]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref><ref name=ac_1004>{{cite video |people=[[Will Waring]], [[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Martin Gero]] |date=2006 |title=Audio Commentary for "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)#ep178|The Ties That Bind]]" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref> Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her hair dryer and curling iron during an offworld mission in "[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)#ep204|The Quest]]" was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; it would have been cut if the footage had allowed it.<ref name=dvd_delscene>{{cite video |people=[[Joseph Mallozzi]] |date=2007 |title=Stargate SG-1 Season 10: Deleted Scenes with Joseph Mallozzi |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]}}</ref> Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing.<ref name=tvzone226 />
