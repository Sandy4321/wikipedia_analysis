'''Chester Rows''' consist of covered walkways at the first-floor level behind which are entrances to shops and other premises.  The rows are found in all the four main streets of the city of [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  They are unique and nothing precisely similar exists anywhere else in the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=50.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Bilsborough| first =Norman | author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1983| title = The Treasures of Cheshire | edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Manchester| place = | publisher = The North West Civic Trust | pages = | page = 17| id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}</ref>  

Their origin has been the source of speculation.  They date from the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] era and were possibly built on top of rubble remaining from the ruins of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] buildings.  In some places the continuity of the rows has been blocked by enclosure or by new buildings, but in other cases more modern buildings have retained the rows in their designs.  The rows are one of the main tourist attractions in the city.

==Description==

At street level the shops and other premises are similar to those found in other towns and cities, although many of the premises are entered by going down a few steps.  On the first floor level are more shops and other premises, set back from the street, in front of which is a continuous walkway.  The storey above this overlaps the walkway, which makes it a covered walkway, and this constitutes what is known as the "row".  On the street side of the walkways are railings and an area which was used as shelves or stalls for the display of goods. The floors above the level of the rows are used for commercial or domestic purposes, or for storage.<ref name=morr13>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=13.}}</ref>  The rows are present, to a greater or lesser degree, in all the streets radiating from Chester Cross, namely Watergate Street, Northgate Street, Eastgate Street and Upper Bridge Street.  They are continuous on both sides of Upper Bridge Street, along most of Watergate and Eastgate Street, but only for a short stretch along the east side of Northgate Street.  Originally there were also rows in Lower Bridge Street but these were blocked during the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|pp=15, 23.}}</ref>

==Medieval period==

During the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period the rows gave access to living accommodation.  The doorway led into a hall, which was usually at right angles to the street.  In some cases the front portion of the hall was used as a separate shop, and in other cases the whole hall was the shop.  In the storey above the hall was the [[Solar (room)|solar]], a room providing private accommodation for the residents.  In some cases, where the hall was larger, there were several shops on its frontage.  Below the rows, at street level, were crypts or [[undercroft]]s.  Many of these were stone-lined with ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], and they were used for storage or for selling more valuable goods. Behind the hall, on the level of the rows, was more domestic accommodation.  Normally the kitchen was a separate building in the yard behind the house.  The back yard was also used for [[cesspit]]s and for the disposal of rubbish.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|pp=50&ndash;51.}}</ref>

==Origins==

Because the Chester Rows are unique and because their precise origins are unknown, they have been the subject of speculation.  [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] evidence shows that they originate from at least as far back as the 13th&nbsp;century.<ref name=morr13/>  Chester has suffered from a series of fires.  In 1278 the fire was so severe that almost all the town within the walls was destroyed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=51.}}</ref>  It has been suggested that following this fire, the owners were ordered to make their grounds floors fireproof, leading to the stone-lined undercrofts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=18.}}</ref><ref name=alcock>{{Citation | last = Alcock| first = N.

Another theory has been developed which links the rows with the debris left from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of Chester.  The debris from the Roman buildings which had fallen into ruin was piled up alongside the streets.  It is suggested that in the medieval period buildings were constructed along the top of this debris.<ref name=alcock/>  The buildings were set back from the street, a footpath passed in front of them, and wheeled vehicles passed along the street below. In time, the properties were improved and, possibly in the 13th&nbsp;century, cellars or undercrofts were excavated in the debris beneath them.  When the buildings were further improved, upper stories were built which overlapped the lower storey, and these provided a covered walkway.  Stalls or shelves were added on the street side of the walkway for the display of goods, and so the fully developed system of rows was developed.<ref name=alcock/>

==Subsequent development==

While many of the rows are still continuous, in some areas they have been blocked.  In Lower Bridge Street originally there was a continuous row.  The first building to break the sequence was at the north end of the street, the building which is now as public house known as ''The Falcon''.  In the 17th&nbsp;century this was the town house of the [[Duke of Westminster|Grosvenor family]].  It was rebuilt in 1626, maintaining its section of the row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=23.}}</ref>  However in 1643, during the siege of Chester in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], Sir Richard Grosvenor moved his family here from his country estate at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]].  In order to increase the size of the house he gained permission to enclose the row.  This set the fashion for other houses in the street to enclose their portions of the row.  Later completely new houses were constructed which did not incorporate the row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|pp=74&ndash;75.}}</ref>  During the [[Georgian era]] more sections of the rows were blocked, especially by commercial development on the north side of Watergate Street.  In 1808 [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] designed the ''Commercial Coffee Room'' in Northgate Street in [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at the ground-floor level, rather than continuing the row on the first floor.  In 1859&ndash;60 ''Chester Bank'' was built in Eastgate Street, again obliterating its part of the row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=86.}}</ref>  However other architects continued the tradition of maintaining the rows in their designs; examples include the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] ''Booth Mansion'' of 1700 in Watergate Street,<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=97.}}</ref> [[Thomas Mainwaring Penson|T. M. Penson's]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] ''Crypt Chambers'' of 1858 in Eastgate Street,<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=106.}}</ref> and buildings in [[Modern architecture|modern style]] constructed in Watergate Street in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|1993|p=39.}}</ref>

The rows continue to be a major tourist attraction in Chester because of their unique nature, their attractive appearance, and the covered shopping experience they provide.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.visitchester.com/site/chester-p100511| title = Chester | accessdate = 8&nbsp;July 2009 | publisher = Visit Chester and Cheshire}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.visitnorthwest.com/chester/rows.htm| title = The Rows | accessdate = 8&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = Visit North West}}</ref>
