The [[Thetford]] treasure is a [[hoard]] of [[Romano-British]] metalwork found near [[Thetford]] in [[Norfolk]] in November 1979. Dating from the mid- to late-4th century AD, this hoard is a collection of thirty-three silver spoons and three silver strainers, twenty-two gold finger rings, four gold bracelets, four necklace pendants, five gold chain necklaces and two pairs of necklace-clasps, a gold [[amulet]] designed as a pendant, an unmounted [[engraved gem]], four beads (one emerald and three of glass), and a gold belt-buckle decorated with a dancing [[satyr]]. A small cylindrical lidded box made from [[shale]] also belonged to the hoard.  They are now in the [[British Museum]]<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/thetford_treasure_gold_buckle.aspx British Museum; Gold Buckle]</ref>.

The find was made under very unfortunate circumstances, and was not reported to the authorities, with the result that, by the time archaeologists were informed several months later, the findspot had been built over, and proper archaeological investigation was impossible.  Rumours that the treasure originally included coins have never been confirmed or convincingly rejected, but it is quite likely that some items may not have been recovered at the time of finding, so that the group as we see it now is incomplete. (See Johns & Potter 1983, pp.13-15).  This lack of information makes it particularly difficult to speculate on the nature of the hoard and the purpose of its concealment in antiquity.

Seventeen of the spoons are ''[[cochlearia (spoon)|cochlearia]]'' , with long pointed handles, and the other sixteen are the larger <i>ligulae</i> or <i>cigni</i>, with short, coiled handles ending in birds' heads.  Many of the spoons bear pagan inscriptions to [[Faunus]], a minor [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god who had characteristics in common with the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  There is no overtly Christian symbolism in the hoard, though one spoon is decorated with the figure of a fish, which can sometimes be an oblique reference to Christianity.  The openly pagan [[iconography]] is one of the most interesting and important aspects of the assemblage, as is the fact that nearly all the gold items are apparently unused.

The dedications, such as DEIFAVNIAVSECI(''RIB'' 2420.21<ref>Frere, S. and Tomlin, R. (Eds.), 1991, ''Roman Inscriptions of Britain, Volume II: Fascicule II'', Stroud: Alan Sutton Publishing</ref>) (literally, 'of the God Faunus Ausecus') are engraved in the bowls of both the <i>cochlearia</i> and <i>cigni</i>.  It has been suggested that it is unlikely that these items were intended to be used for ordinary domestic dining, as their eventual deposition may be interpreted as a ritual act rather than a practical one(See [[Religion in Ancient Rome]]).  However, since both pagan and Christian inscriptions are regularly found on Roman jewellery and domestic tableware, and as the actual motivation for the concealment of the Thetford material itself is unknown, this view is open to debate.

The gold finger-rings could have been worn by either men or women, <ref>Henig, M., 1975, Vindolanda Jewellery, Newcastle upon Tyne: Frank Graham</ref>, though the bracelets, and necklaces with pendants were chiefly feminine jewels at this date.  Many of the rings display elaborate [[filigree]] work, typical of late-Roman taste, and a few are of highly unusual design.  The objects "may well have been commissioned by a group of intellectuals who fervently believed in the old values and who interred the objects when serious persecution of non-Christians began in the 390s".<ref>{{citation |last1=Potter|first1=Timothy W.|last2=Johns|first2=Catherine |title=Roman Britain |publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|page=209 |isbn=0520081684 |lastauthoramp=yes |postscript=.}}</ref>

Much of the jewellery will have been designed and selected for its [[talisman]]ic, religious or personal significance. A gold amulet pendant, intended for suspension around the neck (and with parallels including one from [[York]]), was filled with sulphur, possibly because of its apotropaic qualities<ref> Henig, M., 1984, ''Religion in Roman Britain'', London: B.T. Batsford, pp 187</ref>. One ring is set with an [[engraved gem]] of brown [[chalcedony]] 13 x 9.5mm. Upon it is depicted a cock-headed, snake-legged deity known as an [[Anguipede]], holding a shield which is inscribed in Greek with <U+03A9><U+0391><U+0399>, <U+0399><U+0391><U+03A9> or 'Iao' in reverse - a powerful magical word often associated with this deity (see [[Voces mysticae]]). Although set in a closed-back setting, this gem was also inscribed on its reverse side with the Greek <U+0391><U+0392><U+03A1><U+0391>C<U+039E>C<U+0391><U+0392><U+0391><U+03A9><U+0398> which translates as '[[Abrasax]] Saboath' also a word of power and associated name of the deity<ref> Collingwood, R.G. and Wright, R.P., 1991, ''Roman Inscriptions of Britian Volume II Fascicule 3'' Stroud: Alan Sutton</ref>. It is interesting that a Greek-inscribed charm appears in a hoard primarily associated with an Italian (Latin) minor deity (Faunus), though many other Greek inscriptions are known from Roman Britain, and other examples of late-Antique 'magical gems' have also been found in Latin-speaking provinces.
