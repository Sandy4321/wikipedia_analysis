'''Loyola University Chicago''' is a private co-educational religious-affiliated university established in [[Chicago]] in [[1870]] as Saint Ignatius College.  It was founded by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[religious order]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] and bears the name of the [[Jesuit]] patron, [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius of Loyola]].  Loyola is one of twenty-eight member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]] and, with its current enrollment of more than 15,000 students, is one of the largest Jesuit University in the United States. <ref>http://www.luc.edu/keyfacts/</ref>

==Beginnings and expansions==
Founded in 1870 as the St Ignatius College on Chicago's West Side. In 1908 the [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law|School of Law]] was established as the first of the professional programs. St Ignatius College changed its name to Loyola University in 1909, while also adding the [[Stritch School of Medicine]]. 1923 saw the affiliation of the [[Chicago College of Dental Surgery]] with Loyola University, later to be known as Loyola University School of Dentistry (no longer open). In 1934 West Baden College affiliates itself with Loyola University, later to be known as the Bellarmine School of Theology then the [[Jesuit School of Theology in Chicago]]. Loyola University established the [[Loyola University Chicago School of Nursing|School of Nursing]] in 1935, the first fully accredited collegiate school of nursing in the state of Illinois. Loyola then opened the [[Loyola University Chicago Rome Center|Rome Center for Liberal Arts]] in 1962, the first American university sponsored program in Rome. 1969 saw the establishment of the [[Loyola University Chicago School of Education|School of Education]] and the opening of the [[Loyola University Medical Center]] in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]]. In 1979 the School of Nursing is renamed the Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing. The most recent expansion was the [[1991]] acquisition of neighboring [[Mundelein College]] from the [[Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].

==Main campuses==
Loyola University is anchored at the Lake Shore Campus (on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]]) in [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]], the northernmost neighborhood of the city of Chicago. Loyola has developed a [[Loyola University Chicago Expansion Plan|ten year master plan]] that is designed to revitalize the community by adding an updated arts center as well as a retail district called "Loyola Station" near the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]]'s [[Loyola (CTA)|Loyola]] [[Chicago 'L'|'L' stop]]. Parts of this plan are in doubt as they rely on public tax money, and Article 10 of the Illinois Constitution prohibits any public money for any reason to a religious institution.  Among many others, the science departments are located on this campus.  Loyola also has a Water Tower Campus in downtown Chicago on the [[Magnificent Mile]] of North Michigan Avenue, steps away from such landmarks as the [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] (one of the few structures to survive the [[Great Chicago Fire]]) and the [[John Hancock Center]] (one of the tallest buildings in the United States).  The School of Business Administration, School of Social Work, and the [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law|Law School]] are located at the Water Tower Campus (previously Lewis Towers), and many other classes are held at this campus.  

Chicago's Jesuit university also boasts a campus in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].  [[Loyola University Chicago Rome Center]] was established in [[1962]] on the site of the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] grounds.  It moved to several locations in Rome until finally settling in Monte Mario on the Via Massimi, one of the most affluent districts of the Italian capital.  The campus offers a full academic year for Chicago-based Loyola University students wishing to study abroad.

Loyola University of Chicago has a medical school, the Stritch School of Medicine, and a hospital and medical center associated with them, all located on a campus in [[Maywood, Illinois]], a western suburb of Chicago.  The former Mundelein College is located just south of the Lake Shore Campus.  The former Niles campus no longer exists.

==Religious education==
Religious education is still one of Loyola University's hallmarks as home to [[St. Joseph College Seminary|Saint Joseph College Seminary]] as well as the Jesuit First Studies program.  

Loyola's First Studies Program is one of three in the country, with [[Fordham University]] and [[Saint Louis University]] housing the other two.  During this three year period, Jesuit Scholastics and Brothers generally study philosophy and some theology.  First Studies is one part of an eleven-year formation process toward the Jesuit priesthood.  This program is administered by the Chicago Province   [[Society of Jesus]].

Saint Joseph College Seminary serves the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] and provides vocational training to candidates of diocesan priesthood.  Loyola University also provides rigorous religious education for those seeking careers in lay ministry with the Loyola University Pastoral Institute as well as degree opportunities in [[interdisciplinary]] Catholic studies.

==Athletics==
[[Image:LoyolaRamblers.png|left|125px|Shield of the Loyola Ramblers]]
The Loyola Ramblers compete in the [[Horizon League]] (formerly the Midwestern Collegiate Conference) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The Men's Volleyball team competes in the NCAA's [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] with schools such as [[Ball State]] and [[Ohio State]], and is considered a national power with regular Top 15 rankings. <ref>[http://www.ncaasports.com/volleyball/mens/polls]</ref> Loyola University boasts men's and women's teams in [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[athletics (track and field)|track]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], and [[volleyball]], as well as women's softball.  The Loyola Ramblers title originated in the late [[1920s]] as a nickname given to the school's football team. Today, Loyola University no longer has a football team. The standing joke is that the team is undefeated since 1930.  Outside of the NCAA regulated athletics programs, Loyola Ramblers also compete in non-traditional intercollegiate sports such as [[cricket]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]].

Additionally, in recent years Loyola students have become integral in the resurrection of [[Hurling]], still a major collegiate sport in [[Ireland]] and [[England]], in the [[United States]].

The Loyola Ramblers mascot is [[Lou Wolf]].  Lou Wolf was inspired by the [[Basque people|Basque]] [[coat-of-arms]] of Saint Ignatius of Loyola depicting two wolves over a kettle.  The popular mascot, which had become a Chicago institution through several generations, received a facelift over the summer of [[2000]]. Originally the Loyola mascot was a Gyspy Rambler but many were upset over its racist depiction.

===Civil rights movement and the 1963 NCAA Basketball Championship===
The [[1963 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1963]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship]] and the obstacles faced on the team's road to victory in a racially segregated country put Loyola in the national spotlight.  Before the championship, there was a [[gentlemen's agreement]] among college teams limiting how many black players could play during a game.  Beginning in [[1961]], Loyola head coach George Ireland broke the gentlemen's agreement by putting as many as four black players on the court at every game.<ref>http://www.ramblermania.com/history.htm</ref> In 1962-63, Ireland played four black starters in every game. In a game in Oklahoma City against [[Wyoming Cowboys basketball|Wyoming]], Ireland replaced fouled-out starter John Egan with [[Pablo Robertson]] (even with two white players available on his bench), marking the first time a Division I college team fielded five black players. <ref>http://www.ramblermania.com/1963/index.htm</ref>

After winning its first round NCAA tournament game on [[March 11]], [[1963]] against [[Tennessee Technological University|Tennessee Tech]], the Loyola Ramblers were scheduled to play in the second round against [[Mississippi State University]], which practiced [[racial segregation]].  [[Mississippi]] Governor [[Ross R. Barnett]] banned the Mississippi school from traveling to the tournament to play against Loyola's black players. Sending a decoy team to divert state police, the Mississippi State team successfully sneaked out of the state to play the Ramblers. <ref>http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2006/january/20060106_defining_moments_rls.html</ref> Loyola won and went on to beat [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] in its regional final and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the national semifinals.  At the NCAA Final, newspapers reported that the Ramblers didn't have a chance against [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]], the two-time defending national champions.  In one of the closest games of the season, Loyola became the third Jesuit University ([[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] won in 1947 and [[San Francisco Dons|San Francisco]] won twice in the 1950s) to ever win the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. Loyola remains the only school in Chicago, and in the state of Illinois, to do so.
