==Background==
[[File:Inicio del Juicio a las Juntas Militares - 22ABR85 - presidencia-govar.jpg|thumb|170px|The 1985 [[Trial of the Juntas]] earned President Alfons<U+00ED>n worldwide acclaim and helped overcome voters' dissatisfaction with the economy.]]
[[Ra<U+00FA>l Alfons<U+00ED>n]]'s 1983 inaugural had ushered in a new beginning for Argentina in significant ways, chief among them a new relationship between the [[Argentine military]] and government. Economic policy continued to dominate political dynamics, however, a concern exacerbated by the [[Argentine economy#Debt and depression|economic crisis]] inherited from the [[National Reorganization Process|previous regime]]. The nation's leading labor union, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] was close to Alfons<U+00ED>n's chief opposition, the [[Justicialist Party]], and the tension between the CGT and Alfons<U+00ED>n so evident during 1984 (despite the President's populist early policies) turned to hostility after he replaced the pragmatic [[Bernardo Grinspun]] for the more conservative [[Juan Sorrouille]] in February 1985.<ref>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/democracia/alfonsin/1984.html ''Todo Argentina: 1984'' {{es icon}}]</ref>  Sorrouille curtailed his predecessor's wage [[indexation]] policy (amid 25% monthly inflation), leading to a sudden decline in real wages. Social discontent was compounded by military objections to sharp budget cutbacks, and bomb threats became frequent.<ref name=todo85>[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/democracia/alfonsin/1985.html ''Todo Argentina: 1985'' {{es icon}}]</ref>

Fulfilling a 1983 campaign promise, Alfons<U+00ED>n reacted to military unwillingness to court-martial those guilty of [[Dirty War]] abuses (in which up to 30,000 mostly non-violent dissidents perished) by advancing a [[Trial of the Juntas]], whose first hearings were held in April. This bold move was complemented by Sorrouille's June enactment of the Austral Plan, whose centerpiece, the [[Argentine austral]] would replace the worthless [[peso argentino]] at 1,000 to one. Inflation, which had reached 30% a month in June (1,130% for the year), fell to 2% by August and, though a wage freeze prevented real incomes from rising, these new inflation rates (unseen since 1974) led to quick recovery from a sharp recession early in the year.  Alfons<U+00ED>n enjoyed a 70% job approval rating by the time votes headed to the polls in early November, though he owed none of it to his economic policies, which were supported by only 30% of the public.<ref>''Noticias.'' September 12, 1991.</ref> The strong showing for Alfons<U+00ED>n's centrist [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] resulted, instead, from the Dirty War trial, a risky and daring initiative which had gathered international attention and was, by then, in its closing phase.<ref name=todo85/>
