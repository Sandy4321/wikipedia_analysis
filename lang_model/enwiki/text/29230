'''Thuringia''' held '''state elections''' on 30 August 2009, the same day as the [[Saarland state election, 2009|Saarland]] and [[Saxony state election, 2009|Saxony]] state elections. The election established the composition of the [[Landtag of Thuringia]] ([[Thuringia]]'s parliament). According to the preliminary results, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) together held a bare majority of seats, but a [[grand coalition]] of the SPD and [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) was considered possible.  SPD and CDU formed a coalition seven weeks after the election.<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20091019-22675.html CDU and SPD form Thuringia state coalition], The Local; 19 October 2009.</ref>

==Results==
{{Thuringia state election, 2009}}
Turnout was 56.2%

==Aftermath==
CDU's leader, Dieter Althaus, resigned in the wake of the election defeat, saying he was taking responsibility for the his party's losing its absolute majority.<ref name="Althaus resigns">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/world/europe/04iht-germany.html?_r=1 Merkel loyalist resigns]</ref> However, it had also been noted that his remaining in office was a stumbling block to a coalition with the SPD. Both parties preferred that coalition to an SPD-Left-Green coalition: the CDU because such a coalition would leave them in opposition, and the SPD because of personal animosity between its leader, Christoph Matschie, and The Left leader Bodo Ramelow.<ref name="Althaus resigns"/> In the end, a grand coalition of CDU and SPD was formed with new CDU leader [[Christine Lieberknecht]] as Minister-President.
