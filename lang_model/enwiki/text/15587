'''Ellen Gould White''' (''n<U+00E9>e'' '''Harmon''') ([[November 26]], [[1827]] &ndash; [[July 16]],[[1915]]) born to Robert and Eunice Harmon, was a Christian American leader whose [[Prophetic gift of Ellen White|prophetic ministry]] was instrumental in founding the Sabbatarian Adventist movement that led to the rise of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

Followers of Ellen G. White regard her as a modern-day prophet. Her [[restorationist]] writings showcase the hand of God in Seventh-day Adventist history. This cosmic conflict, referred to as the "[[great controversy theme]]", is foundational to the development of [[Seventh-day Adventist theology]]. Her involvement with other Sabbatarian Adventist leaders such as [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]] and her husband [[James Springer White|James White]] would create a nucleus of believers around which a core group of shared beliefs would emerge. Ellen White believed that [[Jesus Christ]] would return to this earth soon to claim his remnant people and take them to [[heaven]].

White was a controversial figure within her own lifetime. She claimed to receive a vision soon after the [[Millerites|Millerite]] [[Great Disappointment]]. In the context of many other visionaries, she was known for her conviction and fervent faith. With the sole exception of [[Agatha Christie]], White is said to be the most translated female writer in the history of literature and the most translated American author of either gender.<ref name="estatebio">{{cite web

She was a [[leadership|leader]] who emphasized [[education]] and [[health]] and promoted establishment of [[schools]] and medical centers. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books; but today, including compilations from her 50,000 pages of manuscript, more than 100 titles are available in English. Among her works is the popular Christian book, ''Steps to Christ''. Adventists believe she experienced over 2000 visions.

==Early life, family, and religious experiences==
(See White's [http://www.whiteestate.org/graphics/ancestralchart.jpg ancestral chart] (JPG)).

On her way home from school at the age of 9 years, Ellen Harmon was "seriously injured" when she was struck in the nose by a rock thrown by a schoolmate. Severely traumatized, she remained unconscious for three weeks. This injury prevented her from being able to continue her education. The two or three years of education she had received was quite typical for an American girl during the 1830s.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>

In [[1840]], at age 12, her family became involved with the [[Millerites|Millerite]] movement. Attending [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] lectures made Ellen feel that she was guilty of sin, and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer, and being in this condition for several months. Historian Merlin Burt points to a three-step conversion process. She was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited for Jesus to come again. After her conversion, in her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused the [[disfellowship]] of her entire family from the [[Methodist]] church they attended.<ref>{{cite book

==Early ministry 1844-1860==

Adventists believe Ellen White received her first vision in December [[1844]], shortly after the [[Great Disappointment]] in October that year. She stated that she was with five other women in the home of Mrs. Haines in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]. Her first vision was a depiction of the [[Millerites|Adventist]] people following Jesus, marching to the city (heaven). Upon receiving the vision, White prayed all day that God would not make her share it.<ref>{{cite journal

  | url = http://www.adventistreview.org/2004-1522/story2.html
  | accessdate = 2006-08-30
}}</ref> This vision was taken by those around her as an encouraging sign after the devastation of the [[Great Disappointment]]. She was encouraged both in visions and by fellow church members to more broadly share her message, which she did through public speaking, articles in religious periodicals, and eventually early broadsides and pamphlets.<ref>{{cite book
  | title = Christian Experience and Teachings of Ellen G. White, pg. 57-61.
  | author = Ellen G. White
  | year = 1922
  | publisher = Review and Herald
}}</ref>

Ellen White described the vision experience as involving a bright light which would surround her. In these visions she would be in the presence of Jesus or angels, who would show her events (historical and future) and places (on earth, in heaven, or other planets), or give her information. She described the end of her visions as involving a return to the darkness of the earth. 

The transcriptions of White's visions generally contain [[theology]], [[prophecy]], or personal counsels to individuals or to [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventist]] leaders. One of the best examples of her personal counsels is found in a series of books entitled ''Testimonies for the Church'' that contains edited testimonies published for the general edification of the church. The spoken and written versions of her visions played a significant part in establishing and shaping the organizational structure of the emerging Sabbatarian Adventist Church. Her visions and writings continue to be used by church leaders in developing the church's ethical standards and policies, and for [[devotional]] reading.

On March 14, 1858, in [[Lovett's Grove]], [[Ohio]], White received a vision while attending a funeral service. On that day James White wrote that "God manifested His power in a wonderful manner" adding that "several had decided to keep the Lord's Sabbath and go with the people of God." In writing about the vision, she stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict "between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels." Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme which would eventually culminate in the Conflict of the Ages series.<ref>{{cite book

==Middle life 1861-1881==

From 1861 to 1881 Ellen White's prophetic ministry became increasingly recognized among Sabbatarian Adventists. Her frequent articles in the ''Review and Herald'' (now the ''[[Adventist Review]]'') and other church publications were a unifying influence to the fledgling church. She supported her husband in the church's need for formal organization. The result was the organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1863. During the 1860s and 1870s the Whites participated in the founding of the denomination's first medical institution (1866) and school (1874). Her husband James White died in 1881.

==Later ministry 1882-1900==

After 1882 Ellen White was assisted by a close circle of friends and associates. She employed a number of literary assistants who would help her in preparing her writings for publications. She also carried on an extensive correspondence with church leaders. From 1885-1887 she traveled to Europe on her first international trip. Upon her return she promoted [[E. J. Waggoner]] and [[A. T. Jones]], young ministers, in preparation for a more Christ-centered theology for the church. When church leaders resisted, she was sent to [[Australia]] as a missionary (from 1891-1900).

==Final years of ministry and death 1901-1915==
[[Image:EGW_In_Memoriam.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right]]
Ellen White returned to the United States in 1900. At first she thought her stay would be temporary and she called for church re-organization at the pivotal 1901 General Conference Session. During her later years she wrote extensively for church publications and wrote her final books, including a new edition with historical revisions expounding the title, "[[The Great Controversy (book)|The Great Controversy]]" (1911). During her final years she would travel less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church.

==Major teachings==
{{main|Teachings of Ellen White}}
<!--This section needs to be expanded to include sections about health reform, education, church organization, and various other aspects of theology.-->

=== Health reform === 
At the behest of  Ellen White, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] first established the innovative [[Western Health Reform Institute]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] in 1866, to care for the sick as well as to disseminate health instruction.<ref>"Adventist Health," Company Histories, FundingUniverse.[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Adventist-Health-Company-History.html]</ref> Over the years, other Adventist sanitariums were established around the country. These sanitariums evolved into hospitals, forming the backbone of the Adventists' medical network and, in 1972, forming the [[Adventist Health System]]. 

White's idea of health reform included [[vegetarianism]]. This was in a day and age where "meat and two vegetables" was the standard meal for a stereotypical North American. Her health message inspired a health food revolution starting with Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] in his creation of Corn Flakes. The [[Sanitarium Health Food Company]] as it is now known is also started by this health principle. And it is also based on her health principles that Dr. Kellogg differed from his brothers views on the sugar content of their Corn Flake breakfast cereal. The latter started [[Kellogg Company]].

Her views are expressed in the writings ''Healthful Living'' (1897, 1898) and ''The Health Food Ministry'' (1970).

=== Education ===

White's idea of creating a Christian education and its importance in society is detailed in her writings ''Christian Education'' (1893, 1894) and ''Education'' (1903).

==Historic legacy==
===Ellen G. White Estate, Inc.===
{{main|Ellen G. White Estate}}

The Ellen G. White Estate, Inc., was formed as a result of Ellen G. White's will. It consists of a self-perpetuating board. The Estate continues to exist and has a modest staff that includes a secretary (now known as the director), several associates, and a support staff. The main headquarters is at the [[Seventh-day Adventist]] General Conference headquarters in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. Branch Offices are located at [[Andrews University]], [[Loma Linda University]], and [[Oakwood College]]. There are 15 additional research centers located throughout the 13 remaining divisions of the world church. The mission of the White Estate is to circulate Ellen White's writings, translate them, and provide resources for helping to better understand her life and ministry. At the Toronto General Conference session (2000) the world church expanded the mission of the White Estate to include a responsibility for promoting [[History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventist history]] for the entire denomination.

===Adventist historic sites===

Several of Ellen G. White's homes are historic sites. The first home that she and her husband owned is now part of the Historic Adventist Village in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.adventistheritage.org Adventist Heritage Site]</ref> Her other homes are privately owned with the exception of her home in [[Cooranbong, New South Wales|Cooranbong]], Australia, which she named "Sunnyside," and her last home in [[Saint Helena, California|Saint Helena]], [[California]], which she named "Elmshaven"<ref>[http://www.elmshaven.org Elmshaven website]</ref>. These latter two homes are owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the "Elmshaven" home is also a [[National Historic Landmark]].

==Biography ==

The most comprehensive biography of Ellen G. White is an extensive six-volume work called "Ellen G. White: A Biography" written 1981-1985 by her grandson, [[Arthur L. White]] (1907-1991). A critical work is [[Ronald L. Numbers]]' analysis of Ellen G. White's health reform teachings in the context of other nineteenth-century health reformers "Ellen G. White: Prophetess of Health," rev. ed. (Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee, 1992). Thousands of articles and books have been written about various aspects of Ellen G. White's life and ministry. A large number of these can be found in the libraries at [[Loma Linda University]] and [[Andrews University]], the two primary Seventh-day Adventist institutions with major research collections about Adventism. An "Encyclopedia of Ellen G. White" is being produced by two faculty at Andrews University: [http://www.andrews.edu/~jmoon/ Jerry Moon], chair of the church history department, and [http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/ Denis Fortin], dean of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary. The Encyclopedia is due out in 2007/2008 and will be published by the [http://www.rhpa.org/ Review and Herald]. It will contain contributions by dozens of scholars and an attempt is made to cover every aspect of her life.

For a listing of most of these books, periodical articles, theses, and dissertations see Gary Shearer's Index to Bibliographies on SDA and Millerite History under "White" (updated periodically): http://library.puc.edu/heritage/bib-index.shtml

==Debate regarding the prophetic value of her writings==
{{main|prophetic gift of Ellen White}}
Most Adventists believe her writings are inspired and continue to have relevance for the church today. Some believe that her writings have devotional value only.  Seventh-day Adventists began to discuss her writings at the 1919 Bible Conference, soon after her death. During the 1920s the church adopted a Fundamentalist stance toward inspiration.  Because of criticism from the evangelical community, in the 1940s and 1950s church leaders such as [[LeRoy Edwin Froom]] and [[Roy Allan Anderson]] attempted to help evangelicals understand Seventh-day Adventists better by engaging in extended dialogue that resulted in the publication of ''[[Questions on Doctrine]]'' (1956) that explained Adventist beliefs in evangelical language.

===Adventist statement of belief about the ''Spirit of Prophecy''===
{{main|Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)}}
Ellen White and her writings are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|Spirit of Prophecy]]'' by Adventists.

Early Sabbatarian Adventists, many of whom had come out of the [[Christian Connexion]] were anti-creedal. As early as 1872 Adventists produced a statement of Adventist beliefs. This list was refined during the 1890s and formally included in the SDA Yearbook in 1931. In 1980 statement of 27 Fundamental beliefs was adopted, which was added to in 2005 to the current list of [[28 Fundamentals|fundamental beliefs]]. Ellen G. White is referenced in the fundamental belief on spiritual gifts. This doctrinal statement says:

"One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. ({{bibleverse||Joel|2:28,29|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:14-21|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|1:1-3|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:17|NIV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:10|NIV}}.)"<ref>http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/</ref>

Ellen G. White's writings are considered divinely inspired but not on a par with the Bible. Seventh-day Adventists believe that her writings are subject to the Bible's authority.

===Criticisms===
{{Seealso|Criticism of the Seventh-day Adventist Church}}

Soon after Ellen Harmon's first vision in 1845 doubts were cast as to the reliability and authenticity of her visions. While there would be numerous critics during her lifetime, the most prominent critic was [[D.M. Canright]]. His criticisms are summarized in his [[1919]] book, ''Life of Mrs. E.G. White, Seventh-day Adventist Prophet: Her False Claims Refuted.'' The criticisms found in this book synthesize those of all previous critics and is the basic text for critics of Ellen G. White. Some of the most prominent criticisms include:

*'''[[Mental Illness]]''': Critics argue that Ellen G.White had a [[traumatic brain injury]], was [[cataleptic]] and [[hysterical]] and various neurologists have commented that this may have caused partial complex seizures and hallucinations. They suggest that her visions were actually hallucinations and delusions during non-motor seizures which that led her to believe that she had visions of God.<ref>Gregory Holmes and Delbert Hodder(1981).Ellen G.White and the Seventh Day Adventist Church:Visions or Partial Complex Seizures?Journal of Neurology,31(4):160-161.</ref><ref>E.L.Altshuler(2002).Did Ezekiel have temporal lobe epilepsy.Archinves of General Psychiatry,59(6)561-652.</ref><ref>A. W. Beard. (1963). The schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy: Physical aspects. The Journal of Psychiatry, 109:113-129.</ref><ref>R.Dewhust and A. Beard. (2003).

* '''[[Plagiarism]]''':  Many critics have also accused Ellen White of plagiarism. One such was Walter Rea, who argued against the "original" nature of her supposed revelations in his ''The White Lie.'' An examination of the plagariasm charges with a specific focus on White's teachings on health reform can be found in Ronald Numbers' ''Ellen White: Prophetess of Health'' (originally published in 1976).<ref>{{cite book
  | title = Prophetess of Health: Ellen G. White and the Origins of Seventh-Day Adventist Health Reform
  | author = Ronald Numbers
  | year = 1992
  | publisher = University of Tennessee Press
}}</ref> In this text Numbers argues that her understanding of health reform was simply plagarized from other health reformers and therefore did not come from divine revelation.
* '''Failed prophecy:''' <ref>[http://www.bible.ca/7-prophecy-blunders.htm ''Prophecy Blunders of Ellen G. White'']</ref>Ellen G. White is believed to have made a number of failed prophecies including:
** Jerusalem will never be rebuilt.<ref>[http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates$fn=default.htm ''Ellen G. White Estate Database of Complete Writings.'']</ref>
** The United Kingdom will intervene in the American Civil War.

* '''Denial of the Trinity''': Some critics, as well as some non-Trinitarian Adventists, have asserted that Ellen White denied the Trinity. Orthodox Adventists, for their part, credit her with bringing the Seventh-day Adventist church into a progressive awareness of the Trinity during the 1890s. Some critics assert that her descriptions of the godhead are [[Tritheism|Tritheistic]]. The anti-trinitarian teaching was common among the early Adventists, including White's husband James, [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]], [[Uriah Smith]], [[J. N. Loughborough]] and [[J. H. Waggoner]].<ref>{{cite web

===Responses to criticism===

Seventh-day Adventists have long responded to critics with arguments and assertions of their own. Typical responses to these criticisms include:

* '''Mental illness''': Seventh-day Adventists reject the charge of mental illness or that she had [[seizures]]. Instead they believe that her writings come as the result of divine revelation. In addition to a belief in the existence of spiritual gifts, Adventists point to the "overall ministry of her life" as the best proof of the genuineness of her inspiration. In addition, they believe her visions were often accompanied by supernatural phenomena. One such story relates how on several occasions witnesses recorded her holding a large Bible at arms length for extended periods of time (in one case 20-25 minutes) while she quoted Scriptural passages out loud; she would trace the verses in the Bible with her free hand as she spoke the words, and was apparently unaware of other people in the room. During such incidents, Adventists claim, several [[skeptics]] attempted to pull her arm down, as well as double-check the verses she was speaking aloud against the verses she traced with her finger. The story concludes that these unbelievers could not pull her arm down, and the verses were verbatim quotations from the Bible. 

* '''Plagiarism''': Adventists believe that her use of sources typical for a nineteenth-century writer and that her use of other authors was limited; they generally believe that "she was in control of her sources and that her sources did not control her." Adventists argue that it became increasingly normative to cite sources during her lifetime, and that Ellen G. White subsequently revised her books, changed passages to include quotations from authoritative writers, and at times deleted passages when an author could not be found. When the plagiarism charge ignited a significant debate within the Adventist church during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the General Conference commissioned a major study by Dr. Fred Veltman. The ensuing project became known as the "'Life of Christ' Research Project." The results are available at the [http://www.adventistarchives.org/documents.asp?CatID=13&SortBy=1&ShowDateOrder=True General Conference Archives web site]. Dr. Roger W. Coon<ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/EGWPlagiarism-Coon-98.htm ''Ellen G. White as a Writer: Part III - The Issue of Literary Borrowing'']</ref>, David J. Conklin<ref> [http://dedication.www3.50megs.com/David/index.html ''An Analysis of the Literary Dependency of Ellen White'']</ref>, Dr. Denis Fortin<ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/EGWWhite-Conybeare.htm ''Ellen G. White as a Writer: Case Studies in the Issue of Literary Borrowing'']</ref><ref>[http://www.andrews.edu/~fortind/EGWPlagiarism-Encyclopedia.htm ''The Ellen G. White Encyclopedia'']</ref>, among others, undertook the refutation of the accusations of plagiarism.

* '''Failed prophecy''': Adventist's state that some prophecy, including Bible prophecy, can be conditional. Some, for instance, have suggested that a passage in "Testimonies" refers to the destruction of buildings at the end of time refers to the terrorist attack on New York City on September 11, 2001. However, the Ellen G. White Estate has rejected this interpretation. Recently a number of [[apologetics|apologetic]] books have been published by the church arguing for the validity of her prophetic gift.  Two examples include Don McMahon's book examining the accuracy of Ellen White's medical statements and Graeme Bradford's book ''Prophets are Human.'' However, Deuteronomy 18:21 - 22 clearly states that if a prophet presumes to speak on behalf of God and the prophecy does not come to pass then the prophecy is not of God. Taking this to its logical conclusion, however, the prophet Jonah was also a false prophet, as his prediction of the destruction of Ninevah did not occur due to the Ninevite's repentance. 

'''Jerusalem Never to Be Rebuilt?'''

Ellen G. White wrote in 1851 that "old Jerusalem never would be built up." [1] By itself, the statement looks unsustainable. But when the setting is reconstructed, we find Mrs. White counseling the growing Adventist group that both time-setting [2] and the "age-to-come" notion [3] were incompatible with Biblical truth. She emphasized that the Old Testament prophecies regarding the establishment of a Jewish kingdom in Palestine were conditional on obedience and forfeited by disobedience. Unfulfilled prophecies would be fulfilled to "true Israel" as unfolded in the New Testament text.

Thus the popular movement of the 1840s and 1850s to promote a Zionist state in Palestine was not a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and not a quest in which Adventists should become involved. Her warnings and instruction were designed to turn the interest away from Palestine and toward the work God had opened up before them.

In a September 1850 vision she saw that it was a "great error" to believe that "it is their duty to go to Old Jerusalem, and think they have a work to do there before the Lord comes. . . ; for those who think that they are yet to go to Jerusalem will have their minds there, and their means will be withheld from the cause of present truth to get themselves and others there." [4]

Less than a year later, August 1851, she wrote with greater emphasis "that Old Jerusalem never would be built up; and that Satan was doing his utmost to lead the minds of the children of the Lord into these things now, in the gathering time, to keep them from throwing their whole interest into the present work of the Lord, and to cause them to neglect the necessary preparation for the day of the Lord." [5]

How did Ellen White's readers understand this statement? That there was no light in the popular "age-to-come" teaching, that there is no Biblical significance in the Jews' returning to Palestine, that Jerusalem will never be rebuilt in a future millennial period. She was not talking about a possible political rebuilding of Jerusalem but of a prophetically significant rebuilding of Old Jerusalem. To continue to think that way, she emphasized, was to sink further into Satan's deceptions and away from present duty.

For further study of this topic, see Julia Neuffer, "The Gathering of Israel," in the Reference Library.

'''England to Declare War During the U.S. Civil War?'''

Did Ellen G. White predict that England would declare war against the United States? Here is the context of her comment:

"England is studying whether it is best to take advantage of the present weak condition of our nation, and venture to make war upon her. She is weighing the matter, and trying to sound other nations. She fears, if she should commence war abroad, that she would be weak at home, and that other nations would take advantage of her weakness. Other nations are making quiet yet active preparations for war, and are hoping that England will make war with our nation, for then they would improve the opportunity to be revenged on her for the advantage she has taken of them in the past, and the injustice done them. A portion of the Queen's subjects are waiting a favorable opportunity to break their yoke; but if England thinks it will pay, she will not hesitate a moment to improve her opportunities to exercise her power, and humble our nation. When England does declare war, all nations will have an interest of their own to serve, and there will be general war, general confusion" (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 259).

Note the conditional character of these statements: "She fears, if she should commence war abroad, that she would be weak at home." "But if England thinks it will pay." Then follows the sentence: "When England does declare war. . . ." It is evident that Mrs. White is here using the word "when" as a synonym for "if," which is good English. In fact, if we do not thus understand the word "when" in this connection, we have an unusual situation--a series of problematical "ifs" is followed by a simple statement that England is going to declare war. Thus Mrs. White's last sentence would make pointless her preceding sentences.

A similar use of the word "when" is found on the preceding page in her work: "When our nation observes the fast which God has chosen, then will He accept their prayers as far as the war is concerned." No one will argue that the word "when" in this connection introduces a simple statement concerning a future fact that will undebatably happen.

An inspired parallel to this "if" and "when" construction is found in Jeremiah 42:10-19. The prophet speaks to Israel about abiding in Palestine rather than going down into Egypt:

    "If ye will still abide in this land. . . ." Verse 10.
    "But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land. . . ." Verse 13.
    "If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt. . . ." Verse 15.
    "When ye shall enter into Egypt . . . ." Verse 18.

It is evident that the phrase "when ye shall enter into Egypt" is synonymous with "if ye shall enter into Egypt."

With the clause "when England does declare war," understood as synonymous with "if England does declare war," the statement changes from a prediction to a statement of mere possibility, but a possibility, however, whose full potentialities many might not realize.

* '''Denial of the Trinity''': Many Adventists argue that, while she never used the terms "Trinity" or "Triune" in her published writings, Ellen White did use the term "trio" (as in ''Evangelism'' pp. 613-617) and was Trinitarian in her views.<ref> [http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/trinity/moon/moon-trinity2.htm The Role of Ellen G. White in The Adventist Trinity Debate]</ref>
