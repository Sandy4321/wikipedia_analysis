'''Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet'''<ref>Though online sources  often refer to him as '''Edward G. Hulton''' or '''Edward George Hulton''', the ascription of this middle name seems mistaken, presumably the result of confusion with his son, the magazine publisher Sir Edward George Warris Hulton (1906<U+2013>1988)</ref> (3 March 1869, [[Manchester]] <U+2013> 23 May 1925, [[Downside, Surrey]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[newspaper]] [[publisher]] and [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner. He founded the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' (a newspaper conservative in its views and populist in its tone) in 1909. He was created a '''Baronet''', of Downside, in the Parish of Leatherhead in the County of Surrey, in 1921.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32558 |date=23 December 1921 |startpage=10486 }}</ref>
