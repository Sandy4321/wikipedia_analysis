"'''Party in the U.S.A.'''" is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Miley Cyrus]]. The song was written by [[Dr. Luke]], [[Claude Kelly]], and [[Jessie J|Jessica Cornish]] and produced by Dr. Luke. It was released on August 11, 2009, by [[Hollywood Records]], as the [[lead single]] from Cyrus' first extended play ''[[The Time of Our Lives (EP)|The Time of Our Lives]]''. The song was not originally written for Cyrus, though once it reached her, the songwriters adjusted the lyrics to fit Cyrus' persona. Not completely identifying with "Party in the U.S.A.", she chose it for ''The Time of Our Lives'' partially due to a need for tracks. The song's music merges elements found within [[R&B]] and pop music, while the lyrics reflect her relocating from [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to [[Hollywood, California]].

"Party in the U.S.A." was a critical and commercial success, reaching the top ten of charts in eight countries. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Cyrus' best-charting single to date and sixth-best-selling digital single of 2009. It was also deemed one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States|best-selling singles in the United States]] and Hollywood Records' fastest and best-selling single to date. The single was certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and quadruple platinum by the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] (CRIA). 

The [[music video]] for "Party in the U.S.A.", directed by [[Chris Applebaum]], pays tribute to the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and Cyrus' parents' courting days. It occurs mainly at a [[drive-in theater]] and won the [[List of MuchMusic Video Award winners for Best International Artist Video|MuchMusic Video Award for Best International Artist Video]] at the 2010 award show. The song was performed live for Cyrus' first world tour, the 2009 [[Wonder World Tour]]. At the 2009 [[Teen Choice Awards]], Cyrus' use of a pole during a performance of "Party in the U.S.A.", which some interpreted to be a [[dance pole]], caused a media uproar. "Party in the U.S.A." has been [[cover version|covered]] by various artists.

The bottom of the image shows a teenage female with long, brunette hair facing forward as she grasps chains with both of her hands.|The scene from ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' where Travolta sings "Sandy" (''top'') triggered the conception for the [[music video]] for "Party in the U.S.A." (''bottom'').]]
Cyrus contacted [[Chris Applebaum]] to direct the accompanying [[music video]] for "Party in the U.S.A.", with ideologies for the video already conceived. Her ideas for the video's theme were about "high-gloss, glamorous [[white trash]]."<ref name="mtvgrease">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622387/20090925/cyrus__miley.jhtml|title=Miley Cyrus 'Party In The U.S.A.'

In the scene, Travolta exits from a car and walks over to a [[jungle gym]], where he sits on a [[swing (seat)|swing]] and performs the song as projections are displayed in the background.<ref name="mtvgrease" /> To render homage to her parents' courting days, Cyrus and Applebaum named a [[drive-in theater]] in the video Corral Drive-In after a [[Kentucky]] drive-in where Cyrus' parents had a date. "In addition, Miley's mom Tish used to drive '79 black [[Pontiac Trans Am]], ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977) style, and obviously that's the car that Miley arrives in", Applebaum said.<ref name="mtvgrease" />

The video commences by showing a drive-in theater in the day. Cyrus later arrives in the black 1979 Pontiac Trans Am, clothed by a black tank top, distressed hot pants, [[cowboy boots]] and a black vest. Cyrus and several female extras make their way to a blue [[pick-up truck]], where Cyrus sings using a digital [[microphone]] and the extras accompany her. In the song's second verse, Cyrus lies against a wall depicting the drive-in's name, "Corral Drive-In". Then, an [[American flag]] unravels before a single wall in a vacant landscape, where she performs as sparkled confetti drops from above. Later, she, standing on a swing in the center, and numerous backup dancers appears in a jungle gym during the evening. For the song's last refrain, Cyrus performs with four backup dancers on a stage, where the background portrays the American flag and letters above it that spell "USA". Cut-scenes feature people entering the drive-in theater, Cyrus walking throughout the drive-in alone, or her and the backup dancers performing in the jungle gym. The video ends with Cyrus flipping her hair in the stage setting.
