The '''Water Tribe''' is a collective term for a [[nation]] of people in the [[fictional universe]] of the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] [[animated television series]] ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. One of the series' "[[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Premise|Four Nations]]," the Water [[Tribe]] is divided into two [[nation-states]]: the ''[[#Southern Water Tribe|Southern Water Tribe]]'', which inhabits the [[South Pole]], and the ''[[#Northern Water Tribe|Northern Water Tribe]],'' which inhabits the [[North Pole]]. There is also a small population of Waterbenders located in the swamps of the Earth Kingdom. The Water Tribe is home to an order of [[men]] and [[women]] who practice [[Waterbender|waterbending]], the mystical art of [[List of comic book superpowers#Water and moisture manipulation|hydrokinesis]]. According to [[Uncle Iroh]], Waterbenders can adapt to different situations easily, as they manipulate water, the "element of change."

== Appearance ==
[[Ethnic]]ally [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], members of both tribes typically have light or deep brown hair, blue eyes and light brown/tan [[human skin color|skintone]]. Water Tribe clothing is typically a set of blue [[anorak]] and [[trousers]] trimmed with white fur, and worn with [[mitten]]s and [[mukluk]]s. Men may wear their hair long and half-up or in short [[ponytail]]s, referred to as "warrior's wolf tails."<ref name="The Chase">{{cite episode | title = The Chase | episodelink = The Chase (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|The Chase | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-05-26 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 8}}</ref> Women plait and braid their hair in various styles, sometimes with accent beads, and many sport "hair loopies" in various styles. In the Northern Water Tribe, males appear to wear a darker blue than those of the Southern Water Tribe.<ref name="The Waterbending Master">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Waterbending Master| title=The Waterbending Master| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

== National emblem ==
[[Image:WaterTribeInsignia.svg|thumb|The national emblem|160px]]
The [[national emblem]] of the Water Tribe is a circle comprised of a waning [[crescent moon]] and three wavy horizontal lines representing ocean waves. It is displayed on the pennant of the [[watchtower (fortification)|watchtower]] in the Southern Tribe Village, and present throughout the architecture of the [[#Northern Water Tribe|Northern Water Tribe]]. The emblem symbolizes the Moon Spirit Tui and the Ocean Spirit La, who provide the Water Tribes their life, grant them their power, and guide their beliefs. The two spirits coexist in perfect harmony, with the moon's force exerting a pushing and pulling motion on the ocean's water. Not only is this pushing and pulling concept foundational to the art of [[waterbending]], but the relationship between the spirits also drives the Water Tribes' philosophy in peaceful cooperation among all nations.<ref>{{cite book

The Northern Tribe is a [[patriarchal]] [[chiefdom]] but has the aspects of a tribal group as its ruler is the [[chief of state]].

== Culture ==
The Water Tribe is divided into three distinct groups, primarily based on their geography and affinity for waterbending. The Southern Tribe occupies the Southern Pole with [[Katara]] as its only known bending member,<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref> the art having been almost completely erased from the South Pole as a direct result of sheer amount waterbending trainers dying fighting and being taken captive in Fire Nation raids.<ref>{{cite book

=== Season ===
Each of the Four Nations is influenced by their own distinct, dominant season. The Water Tribe's dominant season is winter. To an effect, more Waterbenders are born during winter than any other season and their powers are at their strongest during the season due to the longer nights.<ref>{{cite book

=== Natural Resources and Foods ===
Inhabiting frozen poles near the seas, the Water Tribes inherently are dependent on the oceans for a majority of their natural resources as well as the bounty of the frozen tundra. Sea prunes are a favorite, while giant sea crabs are considered a delicious delicacy to those in the Northern Sea. Squid and seaweed can be used to make a wide variety of dishes, including soup, seasoning, and even bread and cookies.

Skins from seals are used to create decorative tents, while pelts from polar bears and other furry animals are used as clothing and to cover barren surfaces. Naturally, hunters and fishermen of the Water Tribes are some of the best in the world in their field.<ref>{{cite book

== Military ==
As a result of the strong customary theme expressed by the two major sects, the Water Tribes militia is considerably less sophisticated than that of the more modern Earth Kingdom or the industrialized Fire Nation. Nevertheless, the tribes also exhibit deep pride and willpower akin to that of a warrior race.

=== Warriors ===
All adult male tribe members are fully-trained warriors. Their [[weapon]]ry includes [[club (weapon)|clubs]], bladed [[boomerangs]], [[spear]]s made of [[bone]] (also used in [[spearfishing]]),<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref> [[scimitar]]s,<ref name="Bato of the Water Tribe">{{cite episode | title = Bato of the Water Tribe | episodelink = Bato of the Water Tribe | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-10-07 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 15}}</ref> and machetes laced with [[whale]] [[teeth]] on the dull side of the blade. Water Tribe warriors typically wear black and white warpaint on their full face before going into battle.<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref> In severe combat, Southern Water Tribe warriors don protective battle gear, denoted as wolf armor. Wearing plated arm and leg guards along with a silver helmet shaped into wolf's head, the outfit is designed to intimidate the enemy, as when warriors charge, they resemble a pack of wild wolves.<ref name="The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion">{{cite episode | title = The Day of Black Sun | episodelink = The Day of Black Sun (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2007-11-30 | season = 3 (Book 3) | number = 1}}</ref>
[[Waterbender|Waterbending]] warriors of the Northern Tribe are all masters of their element and wear hooded face masks to cover their mouths.
[[Image:WT Warriors+Benders.png|thumb|left|Waterbenders and warriors of the Northern Tribe]]
The more organized Northern Water Tribe makes use of armories located on the warrior training grounds which serve as weapons storage and war planning rooms where orders are distributed. Their Waterbenders engender and utilize a countless amount of iceberg spikes scattered across the ocean just outside the city as a first line of defense against Fire Nation ships. The spikes are capable of ripping through solid metal and sinking even the largest ships. The currents in the iceberg fields are known to be extremely dangerous, but are easily traversed by Water Tribe vessels.<ref name="Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website">[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website]</ref> The iceberg spikes themselves are also used as cover for warriors to hide behind, enabling to easily ambush any unwanted visitors.<ref name="The Waterbending Master">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Waterbending Master| title=The Waterbending Master| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref> 

While its sister tribe had been the victim of raids, thanks to a mixture of strong, man-made defenses and imposing, natural icy landscape, the Northern Water Tribe has sufficiently been able to stave off the Fire Nation for over eighty-five years.<ref name="The Siege of the North">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Siege of the North| title=The Siege of the North| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

Two years before the Avatar returned, all the men of the Southern Water Tribe were sent to fight in the war, leaving the village defenseless.<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref> In "[[The Guru (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|The Guru]]," the warriors are finally seen again, protecting the shores of Chameleon Bay, the single [[inlet]] leading directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. The warriors had apparently achieved this so far with the use of "tangle mines," buoyant, terrible-smelling makeshift mines of Hakoda's invention, which he affectionately nicknames the "stink n' sink." The tangle mines are constructed with a bamboo frame and covered with dried animal skin, while the inside is filled with stinkfish and seaweed. These mines float in the water and detonate when a ship hits them. When the mines detonate, they erupt seaweed, which tangles around the propeller of the ship, incapacitating it, and stinkfish, which terrible smell forces people to abandon ship. Though a very unusual type of mine, they had apparently been quite effective.

The Southern Tribe warriors were last seen sailing off to engage in a battle with what was reported to be four Fire Nation ships closing in on waters near the Earth Kingdom capital.<ref name="The Guru">{{cite episode | title = The Guru | episodelink = The Guru (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-12-01 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 20}}</ref> As illustrated in "The Bridge," a [[canonical]] interlude comic featured within the second All-''Avatar'' [[Nickelodeon Magazine#Nickelodeon Magazine Presents|Nick Mag Presents]] edition, the warriors were able to stave off the enemy vessels, but their ships sustained serious damage from the battle that left them barely sailable and utterly powerless to handle another confrontation. However, thanks to Sokka's ingenuity, the Southern Tribe warriors were not only able to obtain another ship, but also safely sail right through enemy territory. After abandoning and sinking their own ships to trick an approaching Fire Nation scout ship, the warriors were able to sneak aboard in the dead of night. The warriors gained the upper hand in the ensuing battle because of their enemy's general unreadiness as well as their own use of paralyzing stink bombs. Once the ship was captured, the Southern Tribe warriors donned Fire Nation uniforms which gained them entry through the barricade that closed off the Serpent's Pass and headed west for the Fire Nation homeland.

=== Navy ===
The ships of the Southern Tribe seem to be [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] sailing ships, containing wooden hulls and utilizing the wind for propulsion. The boats are shown to be operated by at least two people, one to maintain the main sail and one to control the jib, a smaller sail at the rear.<ref>{{cite book

The Northern Water Tribe's most common ship is a double-hulled vessel powered by waterbending. Though its small, compact size enables it to be used for a variety of applications, including transporting civilians across the canals within the city, its main purpose is to be used for short, open ocean trips. Even though its not necessarily designed for long voyages, it is capable of being used to travel over a thousand miles and withstanding the harshest ocean conditions.<ref name="Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website">[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website]</ref> Warriors use this ship to patrol and protect the waters just outside the Northern Water Tribe.<ref name="The Waterbending Master">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Waterbending Master| title=The Waterbending Master| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

Conceptualized by Sokka and constructed by the Earth Kingdom inventor the Mechanist, waterbending-powered [[submarine]]s were actively used by members of the Water Tribe during the Fire Nation invasion. Resembling a smiling whale-dolphin, these large underwater vehicles possess a hull composed of waterproof wood and metal equipped with watertight glass windows that allows them to traverse deep beneath the ocean surface. The watercrafts function by propelling through the ocean with flexible fins on each side and the rear while sinking or floating by means of the Waterbenders riding inside. The submarines are also equipped with firepower in the form of torpedoes encased in ice. Crafted by pouring blasting jelly into a hollowed out section of a torpedo and freezing it along with the lit fuse, the projectile is launched via waterbending and designed to explode upon making contact with its target. There was only one real flaw that the vessels retained, that being their limited air supply, which makes it necessary to resurface periodically for air.<ref name="Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website">[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website]</ref>

== Southern Water Tribe ==
=== History ===
[[Image:SWT Teamshot.png|thumb|Southern Water Tribe members]]
Originally, the Water Tribe existed as one solely in the North Pole, however, following civil unrest, a group of warriors, benders, and healers journeyed to the South Pole to found a new tribe. Due to the division, the two sects evolved quite differently. Decades ago, the Southern Water Tribe was once part of a beautiful, bustling city carved out of the ice by Waterbenders, similar to the Northern Water Tribe, but was subsequently destroyed following the attack on the Four Nations. Contact between the two Tribes were severed and the Southern Tribe was split into smaller groups and scattered across the Pole, its natives reduced to dwelling within simple sealskin tents and small igloos.<ref>{{cite book

The Southern Water Tribe is currently in dire straits, teetering on the brink of extinction. Its remaining population is dwindling due to [[Fire Nation]] raids and is currently defenseless, as its warriors left for the [[Earth Kingdom]] to aid in the century-long war against the Fire Nation two years ago. With the departure of the sole remaining Waterbender, Katara, and warrior, Sokka, with Aang the Avatar, the people consist mostly of elderly and middle aged women and very young children.<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref> However, in the aftermath of the Fire Nation's [[siege]] of the North Pole, select benders and healers from the Northern Tribe, led by Master Pakku, have left for the South Pole in an effort to rebuild their ravaged sister tribe.<ref name="The Siege of the North">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Siege of the North| title=The Siege of the North| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

=== Customs ===
The Tribe has a unique [[rite of passage]] called "Ice Dodging." This a coming-of-age rite that serves as a young boy's first step in being realized as a true warrior of his tribe. When a male tribesman turns fourteen, he is taken out on a [[boat]] with his [[father]], and challenged to guide it through [[iceberg]]-studded waters. If and when the boy succeeds, he receives a mark on his forehead symbolizing his defining trait, and is declared a full member of the tribe. The mark of the wise is awarded for leadership quality and making decisions under pressure. The mark of the brave is given for inspirational displays of courage. Finally, the mark of the trust is bestowed upon outsiders who prove themselves worthy of the trust of others.<ref>{{cite book

Certain Southern Tribe members are more than willing to liberally adapt the [[ritual]] to new situations. In one instance, tribe member [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender minor recurring characters#Bato|Bato]] took the fifteen-year-old Sokka, his younger sister Katara, and Aang, a twelve-year-old [[Airbender]], on an "ice dodging" expedition in the rocky waters of the Earth Kingdom.

The [[Village]], positioned on a northwestern shoreline, is surrounded by a low, roughly circular snow wall, broken up by a snow watchtower (built by Sokka) to the north that fell when Zuko's ship was landing, and an ungated entrance to the south. Inside are eight residential [[tents]], arranged semi-circularly around a communal [[fire pit]]. A giant [[igloo]] hugs the east wall, while a handful of smaller ones cluster at the north wall. Outside, to the right of the entrance, is a small igloo-structure that serves as the village [[outhouse]]. The remaining population stands at less than two dozen, with ten married and/or elderly [[women]], ten young [[children]], and one [[domesticated]] [[arctic wolf]].<ref name="The Boy In The Iceberg">{{cite episode | title = The Boy In The Iceberg | episodelink = The Boy in the Iceberg | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2005-02-21 | season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 1}}</ref>

West of the village lies a Fire Navy ship, torn open on jutting [[ice shelf|ice shelve]]s by [[waterbenders]].

=== Gender Equality ===
The Southern Water Tribe has been noted to be less segregated than the north, which has specific societal roles for men and women. Though the Northern Tribe forbids women from learning waterbending in anything other than a healer's capacity, it is displayed that they made up at least half of the Southern Water Tribe's division of able Waterbenders and actively fought in battles.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Puppetmaster (Avatar: The Last Airbender)| title=The Puppetmaster | series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref> Overall, the Southern Water Tribe live a more simple, open-minded kind of life.

== Northern Water Tribe ==
=== History ===
Unlike the obliterated [[Air Nomads]] and their southernly sister tribe, the Northern Water Tribe has survived a century of war with the Fire Nation, primarily due to the defenses their icy terrain provides. Resting on the shores of the Northern Sea, inside a [[horseshoe]]-shaped cove behind the high walls of ice, guarded by a curved ice gateway and [[canal lock]] system passable only by the use of waterbending, lies a large and bustling [[monarchy|monarchic]] [[nation-state]]. Ruled by [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters#Book 1: Water|Chief Arnook]], the enormous multilevel capital city is several miles and features a palace, temples, and a hidden oasis which houses Tui and La, the Moon and Ocean Spirits. The capital also retains a standing army comprised of many skilled warriors and Waterbenders. Filled with majestic fountains and waterfalls and flanked by icy sidewalks, the city's roadways are an elaborate [[canal]] system, which people traverse by [[gondola]]. This transportation system was influenced by the city of Venice.

=== Customs ===
[[Image:WT NorthernCity.png|thumb|Northern Water Tribe capital city]]
The people of the larger, older Northern Tribe generally have a greater sense of culture than that of their sister tribe, but along with this strong point towards tradition comes a stricter lifestyle and a greater sense of conformity. Marriages are [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by parents when tribe members turn sixteen, with the bride in particular having no say in the matter. Engaged women wear [[betrothal]] necklaces, navy blue [[choker]]s bearing blue stone [[pendant]]s carved by their husband-to-be. Female Waterbenders are further marginalized, forbidden by custom from learning waterbending for fighting purposes. Instead, they are trained as healers, using their bending abilities to cure sickness and heal wounds.<ref>{{cite book

=== Locations ===
==== Chief Temple ====
[[Image:WT ChiefTemple meeting.png|thumb|Inside Chief Temple]]
The Chief's temple is a large structure seated atop the highest tier of the capitol city and is the most recognizable landmark in all of the Northern Water Tribe, able to be seen at almost any viewpoint. The temple stands like a monument, demonstrating the strength and power of the Northern Tribe. It is here the chief sits with his chieftains and makes decisions regarding the Tribe.

==== Healing Hut ====
These are small, classroom-like huts where Yugoda the Healer and other healing masters teach young, female Waterbenders how to properly utilize their healing abilities, primarily using mannequins with the artificial chi paths of a human body carved into them.

==== Spirit Oasis ====
[[Image:WT SpiritOasis.png|thumb|The Spirit oasis]]
A secluded cove at the base of a waterfall situated behind the chief<U+2019>s temple. This supernatural place is a lush, warm, tropical oasis and the center of all spiritual activity in the entire North Pole. It is believed that the energy of the Moon and Ocean spirits is what keeps the oasis constantly tepid and flourishing. The oasis holds a small koi pond that contains the two koi fish perpetually swimming in circle motion, as well as a spirit gate. During each full moon, the tribe makes an offering to the spirits as thanks for their protection by placing food and objects beneath the oasis gate.<ref name="Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website">[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website]</ref> The grassy island is also used for wedding ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/escape/ Avatar Escape From The Spirit World Online Flash Game]</ref> 

=== Fauna ===
Though the Northern Water Tribe shares much of its exotic fauna with its sister tribe, there are some creatures exclusive to the North Pole. One of these is the buffalo-yak, domesticated beasts of burden used for riding and transporting supplies. The most distinguishable fauna in the area consist of turtle-seals, seal-like animals which sport shells and flippers of sea turtles. The seals can often be found slithering across the frozen floor on its belly and swimming through underwater ice tunnels.<ref name="The Waterbending Master">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Waterbending Master| title=The Waterbending Master| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

== Foggy Swamp Tribe ==
=== History ===
[[Image:TheSwamp AerialView.png|200px|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Foggy Swamp Tribe]]
The Foggy Swamp Tribe are a waterbending Tribe who dwell within a mystical swamp in the Southwest Earth Kingdom. The swamp itself actually consists, in large part, of a single, massive swamp tree, at least several hundred feet tall, whose roots and tree limbs have spread out for miles to form the foundation of the swamp. The Foggy Swamp Tribe's ancestry lies in the Southern Water Tribe. Thousands of years ago, a group migrated from the Southern Tribe and found the Swamp. Feeling comfortable because of the large amount of water, they decided to remain. This information, however, has been lost to both tribes' history, resulting in neither of the two knowing the other exists.<ref name="Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website">[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ Official Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender website]</ref> 

=== Customs ===
They speak with a [[Mississippi River Delta]] accent, with whom they share much of their stereotypes. Though technologically unsophisticated, the tribe retains powerful Waterbenders, some of which express unique applications of their element along with the exclusive ability of Plantbending a style that is apparently difficult to master as only one member demonstrates it at all. Their diet consists of freshwater fish, small game and giant insects, and they keep alligator-catfish as pets. Though they wear green as opposed to the Polar Tribes' blue, it could be pointed out that the water in their area is green and they are thus consistent with the other cultures of the ''Avatar'' world in using their element as a primary color motif. The Foggy Swamp Tribe is also very in tune to their natural surroundings as they have a keen understanding of the workings of the natural world and a belief that all life is connected and is reliant on each other.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Swamp (Avatar: The Last Airbender)| title=The Swamp| series= Avatar: The Last Airbender| serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender}}</ref>

The Foggy Swamp Tribe's Waterbenders have a different style of bending than that of their polar cousins.<ref name="The Library">{{cite episode | title = The Library | episodelink = The Library (Avatar: The Last Airbender) | series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate = 2006-07-14 | season = 2 (Book 2) | number = 10}}</ref> While the North and South pole benders flow with the water, Foggy Swamp Tribe's seem more rigid and straight. This is especially apparent when they are propelling their skiffs, using a much more straight backed style in comparison to when Northern Tribe benders power their gondolas. However, this does enable the Swampbenders to propel their river crafts to very high speeds. Most notably, one member of the Swamp Tribe has also discovered how to manipulate swamp plants by bending the water contained within them.

=== Fauna ===
Both the flora and fauna of the humid swamp are densely packed and home to a variety of insects, ranging from [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Glow Fly|glowing flies]] to blood sucking [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Elbow Leech|Elbow leeches]]. The swamp is also home to [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender creatures#Catgator|Catgators]], a cross between a catfish and an alligator. The catgators act as [[bottom feeder]]s of the swamp, eating almost anything they can get their teeth on. Though they appear ferocious, the gators are usually docile towards the human inhabitants of the swamp, who are known to keep them as pets.
