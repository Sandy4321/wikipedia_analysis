'''''Star of Love''''' is the debut studio album by [[English people|English]]/[[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Electronic music|electronic]] artists [[Crystal Fighters]].
The album was released on the 4th of October 2010 through Zirkulo records.<ref name="McMahon"/> ''Star Of Love'' is a [[backronym]] of SOL, the Spanish word for "sun".<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Lester |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/28/crystal-fighters-basque-dance-music |title=Crystal Fighters: Bringing Basque the beats &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

The general theme and feel of the album stems from singer Laure Stockley's grandfather's writings; specifically an opera he was working on during the breakdown of his mental health and shortly before his death.<ref name="RoughTrade">{{cite web | url=http://www.roughtrade.com/site/news_detail.lasso?story_id=1281 | title=Rough Trade album origins info | work=[[Rough Trade (shops)|Rough Trade]] | date=2010-10-04 | accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> ''Star of Love'' is a continuation of, and homage to, his writings concerning "the unfathomable mystery of the universe, the turbulent journey towards being at peace with death, the triumph of love, and the omnipotence of the sun".<ref name="FACTmagInfo">{{cite web | url=http://www.factmag.com/2010/07/22/crystal-fighters-aim-for-star-of-love-on-debut-lp/| title=Fact Mag album release announcement| work=[[FACT (United Kingdom magazine)|FACT]] | publisher=The Vinyl Factory | date=2010-07-22 | accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> What this actually translates to is a combination of traditional Basque instruments, such as the Txalaparta, the [[danbolin]] and the [[txistu]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilikemusic.com/indie/Crystal_Fighters_Equipment-11318 |title=Crystal Fighters Take Over: Our Equipment &#124; indie |publisher=ilikemusic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> mixed in with "filthy bass drops",<ref>{{cite web|last=Cut |first=The |url=http://cmuthecut.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/crystal-fighters-star-of-love/ |title=Crystal Fighters <U+2013> Star of Love <U+00AB> The Cut Magazine |publisher=Cmuthecut.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> electro driven bass lines and a bit of Spanish punk included also.<ref name="Bearded">{{cite web|url=http://www.beardedmagazine.com/albums/article/crystal-fighters-star-of-love-zirkulo |title=Crystal Fighters - Star Of Love (Zirkulo) &#124; Bearded Magazine: The Home of Independent Music |publisher=Bearded Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

==Release and promotion==
Their first studio album, ''Star of Love'' was released a full year after the release of their first single, "Xtatic Truth".<ref name="Bearded"/> During this time, the band continued to work on the rest of the songs on the album, focusing on the continuity of the album, given it's many blended genres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virgin.com/music/interviews/crystal-fighters-interview |title=Crystal Fighters interview - Interviews - Music |publisher=Virgin.com |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

An extended "Limited Edition" version of the album was released exclusively in Australia on the 4th of February, 2011; featuring additional [[acoustic]] versions of the tracks "Follow", "Xtatic Truth", "Plage", "Champion Sound" and "At Home".<ref name="mushroom">{{cite web|author=Name (required) |url=http://mushroomgroup.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/album-bio-crystal-fighters-star-of-love-out-4-february-2011/ |title=ALBUM BIO: Crystal Fighters <U+2013> Star of Love (out 4th February, 2011) &#124; Mushroom Group Promotions |publisher=Mushroomgroup.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><br/>Additionally, a "Deluxe Edition" of the album is being released worldwide on the 8th of August, 2011. This will feature the additional acoustic tracks in the aforementioned limited edition; as well as a cover of "Fiesta de los Maniqu<U+00ED>es", a famous Spanish pop song, by 1980's [[synthpop]] group [[Golpes Bajos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmuso.com/news/669/crystal-fighters-release-039-star-of-love-039-deluxe-edition-on-aug-8th-news-article.html |title=Crystal Fighters release 'Star of Love' Deluxe Edition on Aug 8th News Article - MusicMuso |publisher=MusicMuso.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> The album was reviewed by Benjamin Hiorns, of online music magazine Subba-Cultcha, who awarded the Deluxe edition of the album a score of 7/10, one point higher than his previous review. He states that the 5 additional acoustic tracks "reveal a side the band could do with exploring more definitively on their second album. "Champion Sound" especially inherits a frantic carnival atmosphere which is insanely infectious. "Plage" also is even more charming in this new rendition and there's a real sense of intimacy which the albums "proper" version sacrificed for immediacy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subba-cultcha.com/album-reviews/article.php?contentID=25593 |title=Crystal Fighters - Star Of Love: DELUXE EDITION |publisher=Subba-cultcha.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

===="I Love London"====
The group<U+2019>s second single, "I Love London", was released on Kitsun<U+00E9> on the 1st of December, 2009; featuring Mimi Borelli on vocals. Mimi is also the dancer in the video, which was directed by Martin Zahringer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martinzahringer.tumblr.com/ |title=MARTIN Z<U+00C4>HRINGER/ director's page |publisher=Martinzahringer.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> The track again gained attention from BBC Radio 1, with plays from Nick Grimshaw and [[Rob da Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|author=22:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nvfrh |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Nick Grimshaw, Tuesday - New Boyz and Crystal Fighters |publisher=BBC |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=05:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p2cpw |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Rob da Bank, Eliza Doolittle in session |publisher=BBC |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> "I Love London" was featured in Mixmag's Top 100 Records of 2008, placing at number 91.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixmag.net/2008/12/16/mixmag-top-100-tunes-2008/ |title=Top 100 Tunes 2008 |publisher=Mixmag |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> The single was featured in [[Time Out]] magazines "50 best London songs", coming in at number 49, with a justification as follows: "This deranged, stuttering ode to Crystal Fighters' adopted city of London does exactly what it says on the tin, the repeated near hysterical refrain, 'I wanna go to a friend<U+2019>s party', both refreshing in its cut-to-the-chase hedonistic desire and a reflection of the banality and boredom that relentless London partying inevitably brings".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shanty |first=City |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/527/50-best-london-songs-50-41 |title=London's 50 best songs: 50-41 - Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

===="In The Summer"====
The next single to be released from the album was "In The Summer"; released on the 5th of July, 2010, through Zirkulo records. This single was once again named by the BBC as one of their "Records of the Week".<ref>{{cite web|author=22:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00smq1m |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Nick Grimshaw, With Crystal Fighters on the phone |publisher=BBC |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> "In The Summer" received wide radio coverage, being played by Rob da Bank and [[Zane Lowe]];<ref>{{cite web|author=05:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t5gnj |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Rob da Bank, Fanfarlo in Session, Mount Kimbie in the Studio |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-31 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=19:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t4lwg |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Zane Lowe, Hype Night |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> being featured as a record to "Go buy Monday" by [[Dermot O'Leary]];<ref>{{cite web|author=15:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t0bsc |title=Radio 2 Programmes - Dermot O'Leary, 10/07/2010 |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> and even featuring as one of Huw Stephens's "Hottest records in the world".<ref>{{cite web|author=19:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sy4yf |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Zane Lowe, Huw's T In The Park Mixtape |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> The video was directed by Tobias Stretch and filmed in the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.promonews.tv/2010/07/16/crystal-fighters%E2%80%99-in-the-summer-by-tobias-stretch/ |title=Promo News <U+00BB> Blog Archive <U+00BB> Crystal Fighters<U+2019> In The Summer by Tobias Stretch <U+00BB> Promo News |publisher=Promonews.tv |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

===="Follow / Swallow"====
The double A-side was released on the 27th of September, 2010. The single received positive coverage in the media, with Laura of Glasswerk magazine positively reviewing both singles and describing the tracks as "Jubilant and effervescent"<ref name="glasswerk">{{cite web|url=http://www.glasswerk.co.uk/news/yorkshire/9777/Crystal+Fighters+Announce+UK+Tour |title=Glasswerk Yorkshire \\ Crystal Fighters Announce UK Tour |publisher=Glasswerk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>
James Canham, of ThisIsFakeDIY, mirrors this view, stating:{{quote|"Follow" is the stronger of the two tracks; it builds up slowly but steadily, keeping an exciting pace and loud, infectious chanting (though rhyming 'swallow' with 'way' by adding 'oh' is somewhat [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdochian]]) and into a high paced track that runs through loud choruses, acoustic guitar marrying with electronics (better than [[James Yuill]], don't worry) and pulsing beats.|James Canham <ref name="thisisfakediy">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/tracks/crystal-fighters-follow-swallow#.TibwumFmM9U |title=Crystal Fighters <U+2013> Follow / Swallow &#124; Single Reviews &#124; DIY |publisher=Thisisfakediy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>}}
And had this to say of "Swallow":{{quote|Opening with vocals before adding both nylon string finger picking and rave synths together could fall down so easily, but here it works beautifully and seamlessly, making an identifiable and brilliant sound. The chorus is again catchy and all breaks are done well, it<U+2019>s just not quite as addictive as the other A-Side.|James Canham <ref name="thisisfakediy"/>}}

The music video for "Follow" was directed by Ian Pons Jewell and "Swallow" by Tobias Stretch, once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studiomurmur.com/index.php?/ian-is-rubbisherrrr/ |title=\\\ Crystal Fighters - Follow : Ian Pons Jewell |publisher=Studiomurmur.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mac.com/tobystretch/Site/Videos.html |title=Videos |publisher=Web.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

===="At Home"====
"At Home" was released on the 14th of March, 2011. It was widely played as part of the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist and was [[Devin Griffin|Dev]]'s "Record of the Week" for the 21st of February.<ref>{{cite web|author=21:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yrrf8 |title=Radio 1 Programmes - BBC Radio 1's Review Show with Nihal, Matt Edmondson sits in for Nihal |publisher=BBC |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=22:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xmbwb |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Nick Grimshaw, Tinchy Stryder plays Rob Da Bank's Monday Night Pop Quiz |publisher=BBC |date=2011-01-24 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=13:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yyfwh |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Greg James, Monday - Ricky Gervais, Lacey Turner & Dave Harewood |publisher=BBC |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=04:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00yqhhp |title=Radio 1 Programmes - Dev, Dev finds Prod P's old Compilation CD! |publisher=BBC |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

The single also gained positive reviews from the industry, with Jasmine Phull of ThisIsFakeDIY awarding the album 8/10 and said this of the mix of traditional Basque music and electronica: "The quintet manages to bring two normally opposing genres together with an outcome not unlike one harmonious civil ceremony; the unity of two separate entities that work best when together.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/tracks/crystal-fighters-at-home#ixzz1Sf66c1gf |title=Crystal Fighters - At Home &#124; Single Reviews &#124; DIY |publisher=Thisisfakediy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Major music magazines ''Q'' and ''Mojo'' both awarded the single 4 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|author=Name (required) |url=http://mushroomgroup.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/single-bio-crystal-fighters-at-home/ |title=SINGLE BIO: Crystal Fighters <U+2013> At Home &#124; Mushroom Group Promotions |publisher=Mushroomgroup.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Nick Bryans, of The Whiteboard Project, awarded the album 6.5 out of 10, citing the following:{{quote|A reoccurring and perturbing issue that resonates with the song, is if one would describe as impressive, rather than enjoyable. All the components are there, but it seems to lack a drive or spark. The big issue in this lo-fi style, is when a purposely demure tone starts to sound more like someone simply going through the motions, and certainly the song lacks drive and tenacity. It<U+2019>s not enough to just be able to put styles of music together, you need to achieve something out of the ordinary with it.|Nick Bryans <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thewhiteboardproject.tumblr.com/post/3726662016/single-crystal-fighters |title=Whiteboard Music, Single: Crystal Fighters |publisher=Thewhiteboardproject.tumblr.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>}}

===="Plage"====
"Plage", the final single from the album, is due for (worldwide) release on the 8th of August, 2011; coinciding with the release of the "Deluxe Edition" of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixmag.net/2011/06/24/crystal-fighters-back-with-new-single-plage/ |title=Crystal Fighters back with new single <U+2018>Plage<U+2019> |publisher=Mixmag |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> The single was released through [[PIAS]] to the continental European market earlier in the year {{When|date=July 2011}} to both positive reviews and chart success in Holland.<ref>http://dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?year=2011&date=20110709&cat=s</ref>
Whiteboard music awarded the single 8.7 out of 10, citing that the single "is an extraordinarily pleasant breath of fresh air into the current indie music scene".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thewhiteboardproject.tumblr.com/post/7128024005/single-crystal-fighters |title=Whiteboard Music, Single : Crystal Fighters |publisher=Thewhiteboardproject.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

''Star of Love'' received widely varying reviews. [[AnyDecentMusic?]], an album [[Review aggregator|reviews aggregator]], calculated an average score for the album of 6.1/10 from 11 independent reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/2241/Crystal-Fighters-Star-of-Love.aspx |title=Reviews of ''Star of Love'' by Crystal Fighters, collected by Any Decent Music |publisher=Anydecentmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> Caitlin Welsh of ''The Brag'' was particularly critical, stating: {{quote|[in]"I Love London", they ape [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]]'s [[Shoreditch]] [[patois]] over [[four-to-the-floor]] beats that are oppressive in their attempts to be visceral, and a robot-fart bass synth that sounds like your speakers aren't hooked up properly. There's no room in the mix, no space between noises to thrash and dance <U+2013> it's going for catchy, edgy hard-dance, and it sounds like a [[Skitzmix]].|Caitlin Welsh <ref name="TheBragReview"/>}} Alex Hoban of ''[[NME]]'' was equally critical, saying that "With [[Delorean (band)|Delorean]] doing the same thing right now so much better, favouring Crystal Fighters would be like being handed an [[LCD Soundsystem]] record and chucking it to listen to [[Hadouken!]]."<ref name="Hoban"/><br>
Opposed to this, Josh Holliday of ''[[Virgin Media]]'' awarded the album a rare perfect score and effusively praised the bands first outing: {{quote|Symbiotic throughout, ''Star Of Love'' is an eclectic barrage of contrasting, and often cacophonously clashing genre combinations. Yet whilst perhaps their most triumphant moment, the naively wondrous "Plage" purveys a concrete sense of stylistic cohesion, it<U+2019>s this constant flittering and fidgeting between reality and surrealism, fact and fiction, British and Basque that propels Crystal Fighters into mythical realms, as they bathe in ticker tape at the heart of a crystal maze only they can conquer.|Josh Holliday <ref name="VirginReview"/>}}Stephen Jones, of the ''[[Metro (newspaper)|Metro]]'' backs this up, saying that "On paper, Crystal Fighters' self-produced 'fast dance music', melding Basque folk instruments and thumping electro punk pop with lyrics from singer Laure's grandfather's addled writings, sounds like a disaster. In reality it works."<ref name="Jones"/>
