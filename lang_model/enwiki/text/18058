'''Norm Grabowski''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hot rod]] builder and actor. The heavy set [[crew cut]] wearing Grabowski appeared in minor roles in many films produced by [[Albert Zugsmith]] and [[Walt Disney]].

In 1952, after leaving military service, Grabowski bought a hot rod and made a number of modifications to the vehicle that gave it a unique stance and appearance which have been imitated many times.  Among the unique features of the car was a shortened [[Model A]] [[pickup truck]] bed attached to a 1923 [[Model T]] body.

The car was featured on the cover of the October, 1955 issue of ''[[Hot Rod Magazine]]'' and later in the April 29, 1957 issue of ''[[Life Magazine]]''.<ref>p.165 Vincent, Peter ''Hot Rod: The Photography of Peter Vincent'' 2004 Motorbooks</ref>

He is best known for creating an influential [[T-bucket]] hot rod, called the Kookie Kar, that was used in the [[television]] show ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]''.  The car was owned and driven in the show by the character Kookie who was played by [[Edd Byrnes]]. <ref>p.74 Grushkin, Paul ''Rockin' Down the Highway'' 2006 MBI Publishing</ref>

As a consequence of the magazine exposure, Grabowski was approached about renting the car out to appear in movies and television shows.  The contacts he made in this way led to an acting career for Grabowski.  He appeared in many movies and television shows, including ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', ''[[Roustabout (film)|Roustabout]]'', ''[[Girl Happy]]'', and ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.

Grabowski is known as a [[wood carver]], and many hot rods and [[custom car]]s feature his [http://www.rumpsville.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=skull&IncludeBlogs=7&limit=20&x=9&y=18  unique hand-carved] [[Human skull|skull]] [[gearshift]] knobs.  He retired from acting in the 1980s after ''[[The Cannonball Run]]''.
