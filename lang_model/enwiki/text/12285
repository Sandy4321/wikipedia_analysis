==History==
{{Main| History of San Antonio}}

[[File:San Antonio, Texas in 1886.jpg|left|thumb|Lithograph of San Antonio in 1886.]]

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] originally lived near the [[San Antonio River]] Valley, in the [[San Pedro Springs]] area, calling the vicinity "Yanaguana," meaning "refreshing waters." In 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and [[missionary|missionaries]] came upon the river and Native American settlement on June 13, the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padova, Italy and named the place and river "San Antonio" in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Jun2004/Feature2.asp#F1 |title=San Antonio: The City of St. Anthony - June 2004 Issue of St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online |publisher=Americancatholic.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

Early Spanish settlement of San Antonio began with the Martin de Alarcon expedition and the establishment of the San Antonio de Valero Mission (now the Alamo) as a means to reassert Spanish dominance over Texas from the nearby French in Louisiana. The viceroy, at the instigation of Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares, made the suppression of illicit trade from Louisiana a primary objective. He also pledged support for the Franciscan missions in Texas. Father Olivares had earlier visited a site on the San Antonio River in 1709, and from that time forward he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a halfway mission and presidio in late 1716, and assigned responsibility for their establishment to Martin de Alarc<U+00F3>n, the governor of Coahuila and Texas. A series of delays, however, occasioned in part by differences between Alarc<U+00F3>n and Olivares, postponed definitive action until 1718.<ref name="tshaonline.org">[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/SS/uqs8.html] Spanish Texas, Texas State Historical Society: The Handbook of Texas Online</ref> The families clustered around the presidio and mission formed the beginnings of Villa de B<U+00E9>xar, destined to become the most important town in Spanish Texas.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/AA/fal2.html] Martin de Alarcon, Texas State Historical Society: The Handbook of Texas Online</ref> On May 1 on the San Antonio River the governor founded San Antonio de Valero Mission (later famous as the Alamo), and on May 5 established San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar Presidio.  San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar Presidio, the center of Spanish defense in western Texas, was founded by Mart<U+00ED>n de Alarc<U+00F3>n on May 5, 1718, on the west side of the San Antonio River one-fourth league from the San Antonio de Valero Mission.<ref name="tshaonline.org"/>

On February 14, 1719, the Marqu<U+00E9>s de San Miguel de Aguayo made a report to the king of Spain proposing that 400 families be transported from the [[Canary Islands]], Galicia, or Havana to populate the province of Texas. His plan was approved, and notice was given the [[Canary Islanders]] ([[isle<U+00F1>os]]) to furnish 200 families; the Council of the Indies suggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana and Veracruz. By June 1730, twenty-five families had reached Cuba and ten families had been sent on to Veracruz before orders from Spain to stop the movement arrived. Under the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland to the presidio of San Antonio de Bexar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. The party had increased by marriages on the way to fifteen families, a total of fifty-six persons. They joined a military community that had been in existence since 1718. The immigrants formed the nucleus of the villa of '''San Fernando de B<U+00E9>xar''', the first regularly organized civil government in Texas. Several of the old families of San Antonio trace their descent from the Canary Island colonists. Mar<U+00ED>a Rosa Padr<U+00F3>n was the first baby born of Canary Islander descent in San Antonio.

San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas, and for most of its history, the capital of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Tejas.  From San Antonio the Camino Real, today Nacogdoches Road in San Antonio, ran to the American border at the small frontier town of Nacogdoches. When [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] unilaterally rescinded the Mexican constitution of 1824 violence ensued in many provinces of Mexico. In a series of battles the anglo Texans succeeded in forcing Mexican forces out of the anglo settlement area northeast of San Antonio.  Under the leadership of [[Benjamin Milam|Ben Milam]], in the [[Siege of B<U+00E9>xar#Battle|Battle of Bexar]], December, 1835, Texian forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General [[Martin Perfecto de Cos]], Santa Anna's brother in law. In the spring of 1836 Santa Anna marched on San Antonio. A volunteer force under the joint command of [[William B. Travis|William Barrett Travis]] and [[James Bowie]] occupied and fortified the deserted mission. The [[Battle of the Alamo]] took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The outnumbered Texan force was ultimately defeated with all of the Alamo defenders killed. These men were seen as "martyrs" for the cause of Texas freedom and "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry in Texas' eventual success at defeating Santa Anna's army.<ref>John H. Jenkins, ed., Papers of the Texas Revolution (10 vols.; Austin: Presidial Press, 973),13</ref>

[[Juan Segu<U+00ED>n]], who organized the company of Hispanic Texans that fought and died for Texas independence at the Alamo and fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, served as mayor of San Antonio. He was forced out of that office, due to threats on his life, by Anglo politicians in 1842 becoming the last Hispanic mayor for nearly 150 years.<ref>Gonzalez, Juan. ''Harvest of Empire''. Penguin, 2000.</ref>

[[Image:San antonio tex 1939.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city, San Antonio, December 4, 1939]]

In 1845 the United States annexed Texas and included it as a state in the Union. This, after some incitement by United States troops along the Mexican border, led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. Though the U.S. ultimately won the war was devastating to San Antonio, and at its end the population of the city had been reduced by almost two thirds, to only 800 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Lewis F.|title=Saving San Antonio: the precarious preservation of a heritage|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock|year=1996}}</ref> After the war prosperity to the city, and by 1860, at the start of the Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people.

Following the Civil War San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle culture. During this period San Antonio remained a frontier city but its mixture of cultures gave it a reputation as being both beautiful and exotic. [[Frederick Olmstead|Frederick Law Olmstead]], the architect who designed [[Central Park]] in New York City, once described San Antonio as having a, "jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings," which gave it a quality which only New Orleans could rival in, "odd and antiquated foreignness."<ref>A Journey Through Texas by Frederick Olmstead  ISBN 1144803802</ref>

In 1877 the first railroad reached San Antonio and the city was no longer on the frontier but began to enter the mainstream of American society.  At the beginning of the 20th century the streets of downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic, destroying many historic buildings in the process.<ref>Saving San Antonio by Lewis F. Fisher  ISBN 0896723720</ref>

Like many [[municipalities]] in the [[American Southwest]], San Antonio experiences steady [[population growth]]. The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 [[census]] to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005 through both steady population growth and land annexation (considerably enlarging the physical area of the city).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[The Fairmount Hotel]], built in 1906 and San Antonio's second oldest hotel, is in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as one of the heaviest buildings ever moved intact. It was placed in its new location, three blocks south of the Alamo, over four days in 1985, and cost $650,000 to move.

[[Image:ATTCenter.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AT&T Center]]]]

The city's only top-level professional sports team, and consequently the team most San Antonians follow, is the [[San Antonio Spurs]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. Previously, the Spurs played at the [[Alamodome]], which was built for [[American football|football]], and before that the [[HemisFair Arena]], but the Spurs built <U+2013> with public money <U+2013> and moved into the SBC Center in 2002, since renamed the [[AT&T Center]].

The AT&T Center is also home to the [[San Antonio Rampage]] of the [[American Hockey League]] and the [[San Antonio Silver Stars]] of the [[WNBA]], both owned by the Spurs Organization. San Antonio is home to the Double-A Minor League affiliate of the [[San Diego Padres]], the [[San Antonio Missions]] who play at [[Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium|Nelson Wolff Stadium]] on the west side of the city. (San Antonio is the largest city in the country with neither a Major League nor AAA baseball team.) San Antonio hosts the NCAA football [[Alamo Bowl]] each December. San Antonio has two [[rugby union]] teams, the [[Alamo City Rugby Football Club]], and San Antonio Rugby Football Club.

The [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] fields San Antonio's only [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletic teams known as the [[UTSA Roadrunners]]. The University recently added football, hiring former [[University of Miami]] coach [[Larry Coker]] as its initial head coach. Roadrunner football will begin play in 2011.

The city is also home of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usarmyallamericanbowl.com/ |title=Welcome to the 2009 U.S. Army All American Bowl |publisher=Usarmyallamericanbowl.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> played annually in the Alamodome and televised live on NBC. The Bowl is an East versus West showdown featuring the nation's top 90 high school senior football players. The game has featured NFL stars [[Reggie Bush]], [[Vince Young]], [[Adrian Peterson]], and many other college and NFL stars.

City officials are said to be attempting to lure the [[National Football League]] permanently to San Antonio and have also said that a strong showing at the Alamodome for the three local Saints games was vital to showing that San Antonio can support an NFL franchise. NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] stated San Antonio was successful in hosting the team, and that the city would be on the short list for any future NFL expansions. The city has also hosted the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Houston Oilers]] preseason camps in the past, and they have signed a contract with the Cowboys in which the Cowboys will practice in San Antonio through 2011.<ref>[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/football/nfl/cowboys/stories/MYSA040106.1C.FBNcowboys.alamodome.7ea018dc.html Football: Cowboys returning to S.A. in '07]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}, ''San Antonio Express-News'', April 1, 2006.</ref> Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has acknowledged his support for the city's efforts to become home to an NFL franchise.<ref>[http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/football/nfl/stories/MYSA050506.3D.FBNcowboys.jones.c71335d.html Football: Cowboys' Jones backs S.A. team], ''San Antonio Express-News'', May 5, 2006.</ref> Although it is the second largest city in the United States without an NFL team (after [[Los Angeles]]), San Antonio's smaller metropolitan population has so far contributed to its lack of landing an NFL, [[MLB]], or [[NHL]] team.

San Antonio will be getting a National Premier Soccer League expansion team in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npsl.myeliteclub.com/LoadPage.aspx?iPage=24-48 |title=New Expansion Teams |publisher=Npsl.myeliteclub.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

==Government==
'''{{further|[[List of mayors of San Antonio]]}}'''

The City of San Antonio runs under a Council-Manager form of government. The city is divided into 10 council districts designed to ensure equal population distribution between all districts. Each district elects one person to sit on the City Council with the mayor elected on a city-wide basis. All members of the City Council, which includes the mayor, are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four terms in total (except for those who were in office in November, 2008 and are limited to a total of two terms). All positions are elected on non-partisan ballots as required by Texas law. Council members are paid $20 a meeting, while the Mayor earns $4,000 a year. Most council members maintain full-time employment in addition to their positions on the council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanantonio.gov/council/ |title=City of San Antonio &#124; Official Web Site - City Council |publisher=Sanantonio.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>  The current mayor is [[Julian Castro]].

The council hires the [[City Manager]] to handle day to day operations. The council effectively functions as the city's legislative body with the City Manager acting as its Chief Executive, responsible for the management of day to day operations and execution of council legislation.  The current City Manager is [[Sheryl Sculley]].

The city operates its own electric and gas utility service, [[CPS Energy]].

The city stretches into several national congressional districts and is represented in [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] by the following:<ref>http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/GIS/map_download/0702GG24.pdf</ref>

===Growth policy===
Unlike most large cities in the U.S., San Antonio is not completely surrounded by independent suburban cities, and under Texas law it exercises [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] (ETJ) over much of the surrounding unincorporated land, including directing growth and zoning.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/GIS/map_download/0607GT09.pdf Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Boundary (PDF)], City of San Antonio Planning Department. July 28, 2006.</ref>  It pursues an aggressive annexation policy and opposes the creation of other municipalities within its ETJ.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.salsa.net/aiasa/sa-mastp.html San Antonio Master Plan], Public Studio (San Antonio Chapter American Institute of Architects). Retrieved January 7, 2007.</ref>  Nearly three-fourths of its current land area has been annexed since 1960.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/powerpoint/Growth_Trends_092506.pps San Antonio Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities (PowerPoint)], City of San Antonio Planning Department. Retrieved January 7, 2007.</ref> In the 2000s the city has annexed several long narrow corridors along major thoroughfares in outlying areas to facilitate eventual annexation of growth developing along the routes. The city planned to annex nearly forty additional square miles by 2009.<ref name="autogenerated4">[http://www.sanantonio.gov/planning/pdf/Comprehensive/three_yr_plan/Three_Yr_Map_01_05_06.pdf Three-year annexation plan (PDF)], City of San Antonio Planning Department, January 6, 2006.</ref>

Involuntary annexation is a controversial issue in those parts of [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] Bexar County affected by it. Residents, attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values, often see annexation as a mechanism to increase [[property tax]] rates (primarily driven by school district taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.<ref>[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/crime/stories/MYSA031107.01A.Fireresponsetimes.370d0e6.html MySA.com: Public Safety]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

==Media and entertainment==
===Print===
[[Image:Woaitvstation.jpg|thumb|right|[[WOAI-TV]] is San Antonio's NBC affiliate]]San Antonio has one major [[newspaper]], the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', which has served the area since 1865. [[Robert Rivard]], who currently serves as the paper's executive vice president and editor,<ref>[http://www2.mysanantonio.com/aboutus/expressnews/ MySA.com: Express-News About Us]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> was named Managing Editor in 1994 and then Editor in 1997. The ''Express-News'' currently circulates as the largest newspaper service in [[South Texas]]. The Hearst Corporation, which owned a second newspaper, the ''San Antonio Light'', purchased the ''Express-News'' from News Corp. in 1992 and shut down the ''Light'' after failing to find a buyer. Hearst, using the Express-News brand, also produces ''Conexion'', a weekly magazine written by an entirely Hispanic staff with a Hispanic spin on weekly events. The ''San Antonio Current'' is the free "alternative" paper published weekly with local political issues, art and music news, restaurant listings and reviews, and listings of events and nightlife around town. In addition, the ''San Antonio Business Journal'' covers general business news. ''La Prensa'', a bilingual publication, also has a long history in San Antonio. The ''San Antonio River Walk Current'' covers general San Antonio news.

===Television===
While the city is one of the ten largest in the United States, its television market is only the 37th in the United States, according to the [[marketing research]] firm [[ACNielsen]].<ref>[http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html Designated Market Areas], Nielson Media Research.</ref> This is primarily due to the relatively low population-density of the outlying areas and the close proximity of Austin, which truncates the potential market area. San Antonio based TV stations are [[WOAI-TV|WOAI]] channel 4 ([[NBC]]), [[KSAT-TV|KSAT]] channel 12 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[KENS]] channel 5 ([[CBS]]), [[KABB]] channel 29 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[KCWX]] channel 2 ([[The CW Television Network|CW]]), [[KMYS]] channel 35([[MyNetworkTV]]) and [[KLRN]] channel 9 ([[PBS]]). The market is also home to 6 Spanish language stations, 3 religious stations, and 3 independent stations. The San Antonio market has 65% [[cable TV]] penetration.

===Radio===
: ''See also: [[Broadcast Media In San Antonio|Broadcast media in San Antonio]]''
'''FM:''' 28 '''AM:''' 20

About 50 radio stations can be heard in the San Antonio area <U+2014> 30 of them are actually located in San Antonio. The first radio station to broadcast in South Texas was [[KTSA|KTSA AM-550]] in 1922.  Some of [[KTSA|KTSA AM-550's]] better known local talk show hosts include [[Jack Riccardi]], [[Trey Ware]] and [[Ricci Ware]]. Another significant station is [[WOAI (AM)|WOAI AM-1200]] (the flagship of Clear Channel Worldwide), which is the radio home of the San Antonio Spurs and features [[Rush Limbaugh]].

There are two [[National Public Radio]] stations in San Antonio, both belong to Texas Public Radio (www.TPR.org); KSTX 89.1 FM is NPR news/talk and KPAC 88.3 is a 24-hour classical music station. KSTX also broadcasts "Riverwalk Jazz", featuring Jim Cullum Jazz Band at The Landing, a fixture on the River Walk since 1963. KRTU 91.7 is a non-commercial radio station based out of Trinity University. Unlike other college radio stations throughout the U.S. the station plays jazz 17 hours a day and college rock/indie rock at night. College Alternative station KSYM, 90.1 FM, is owned by the Alamo Community College District and operated by San Antonio College students and like KRTU it plays the Third Coast music network during the day and alternative music at night.

Most Latin stations in the area play [[Regional styles of Mexican music|Regional Mexican]], [[Tejano music|Tejano]] or Contemporary Pop. But on January 12, 2006, [[Univision]]-owned [[KCOR-FM]] "La Kalle 95.1" changed its format from Hispanic-Rhythmic Contemporary Hits to Spanish Oldies, now named "Recuerdo 95.1". However, Univision announced on November 10, 2006, that it flipped KLTO Tejano 97.7's format to Reggaeton in an attempt to reintroduce the format to San Antonio again. KLTO was acquired earlier in the year and operated as a simulcast of [[KXTN]] Tejano 107.5. San Antonio has quickly diversified in recent years, with the influx of non-[[Tejano]] [[Latinos]], mostly from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], who are serving in the city's various military bases, as well as immigrants from [[Mexico]]. Therefore, just like in the rest of the country, radio station conglomerates have been changing formats in San Antonio to reflect shifting [[demographics]].
