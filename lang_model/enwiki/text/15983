'''''Mandingo''''' is an American motion picture released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1975.

It is based on the novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' by [[Kyle Onstott]], and on the play ''Mandingo'' by [[Jack Kirkland]] (which is derived from the novel). The film was directed by [[Richard Fleischer]] and starred [[James Mason]], [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]], [[Perry King]], and [[boxing|boxer]]-turned-actor [[Ken Norton]]. It was widely derided when released, although some reviews are positive. It was followed by a sequel in 1976, titled ''[[Drum (1976 film)|Drum]]'', which also starred Norton.

==Synopsis==
The movie is set in the [[Deep South]] of the United States prior to the [[American Civil War]]. Falconhurst is a run-down plantation owned by widower Warren Maxwell ([[James Mason]]) and largely run by his son, Hammond ([[Perry King]]). Hammond and a friend go to a [[brothel]] where both men choose to have sex with virgin black women. Hammond chooses Ellen ([[Brenda Sykes]]). Hammond and Ellen watch as Hammond's friend abuses and rapes his choice, claiming that she likes it. Hammond asks Ellen if this is true, and she says no. Hammond then gently has sexual intercourse with Ellen.

Warren Maxwell pressures him to marry, so Hammond chooses Blanche ([[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]]). A social climber and sexually promiscuous, Blanche had been having an affair with her cousin. On their wedding night, Blanche's sexual skill and enjoyment of recreational sex convinces Hammond that she is not a virgin<U+2014>a claim Blanche denies. Hammond returns to the brothel and purchases Ellen as his slave.  Hammond makes Ellen a house slave (one of those who do less physically demanding work) and takes her on trips with him.  He also has sexual relations with Ellen, and in time comes to care for her.

Meanwhile, Hammond purchases a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] slave named Ganymede ([[Ken Norton]]). Nicknamed "Mede", the slave works for Hammond as a prize-fighter.  He's forced to soak in a large cauldron of very hot water to toughen his skin. Hammond also breeds Mede with female slaves on his plantation. Hammond makes a great deal of money betting on Mede's fights, while Mede fathers many healthy babies with the slave women he's told to have sex with.

Rejected by Hammond, Blanche becomes a slovenly alcoholic who does nothing all day long.  While Hammond is on a business trip alone, Blanche discovers Ellen is pregnant. Correctly assuming the baby is Hammond's, Blanche beats Ellen. Ellen flees, falls down some stairs, and [[miscarriage|miscarries]]. Hammond (who had promised Ellen that her baby would be freed), returns to Falconhurst and discovers Ellen lost the baby. Ellen does not tell him how she miscarried, fearful that she will be beaten again by Blanche if she tells Hammond about her beating and fall.  A grieving Hammond gives Ellen a pair of ruby and diamond earrings, which she wears while serving an evening meal. Hammond gave the matching necklace to Blanche, who becomes enraged to find Ellen publicly favored by Hammond.

Hammond leaves on another business trip alone.  A drunken Blanche demands that Mede come to her bedroom.  Although the other slaves attempt to stop him, Mede does as he is ordered. Blanche demands that Mede have sex with her, but he refuses. Blanche then says she will accuse Mede of rape if he does not have sex with her, so he spends the night having sex with her. Blanche's sexuality is re-awakened by Mede, whom she finds exceptionally well-endowed, and she has sex with him several more times.

Hammond returns to the plantation.  A great deal of time has passed since Hammond and Blanche's marriage, and Warren Maxwell is eager for a grandchild.  Sensing that the marriage is troubled, Warren locks Hammond and Blanche in a room together and refuses to let them out until they reconcile.  They appear to do so.  A short time later, Blanche announces she is pregnant.  But when the baby is born, it is clear the child is a [[mulatto]].  To avoid a scandal, the midwife kills the child on doctor's orders.  Sickened at Blanche's sexual indiscretion, Hammond ask the doctor if he has the poison he uses on old slaves and horses. He pours the poison into a tady for Blanche. An outraged Hammond seeks out Mede, intending to kill him.  As Hammond attempts to force Mede into a boiling cauldron of water, Mede tries to tell him that Blanche blackmailed him into having sex.  Hammond shoots Mede twice and forces Mede into the boiling cauldron of water, and uses a pitchfork to drown Mede. In a fit of fury, one of Warren's slaves picks up a shotgun and aims it at Hammond. When Warren calls him a "crazy nigger" and demands that he put the gun down, the slave aims at, shoots, and kills Warren. As the man runs away, Hammond kneels helpless next to Warren's lifeless body.

==Reception==
Upon its release in 1975, critical response was mixed although box office was strong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mandingo/ |title=Mandingo Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] despised the film, calling it "racist trash", and gave it a "zero star" rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750725/REVIEWS/808289998/1023 |title=Mandingo :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref> [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[TIME]]'' found the film boring and clich<U+00E9>-ridden.<ref>Schickel, Richard.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917443,00.html "Cinema: Cold, Cold Ground"], ''[[TIME]]'', May 12, 1975.</ref> Movie critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] was enthusiastic about the film, calling it <U+201C>the greatest film about race ever made in Hollywood.<U+201D><ref>{{cite book |last=Wood|first=Robin |title=Sexual Politics and Narrative Film: Hollywood and Beyond |year=1998 |publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-07605-3 |page=256 }}</ref> In [[Leonard Maltin]]'s annual publication ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' the film is ranked as a "BOMB" and dismissed with the word "Stinko!"

Some prominent critics hail the film, including the ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Dave Kehr]], who called it "a thinly veiled Holocaust film that spares none of its protagonists," further describing it as "Fleischer<U+2019>s last great crime film, in which the role of the faceless killer is played by an entire social system."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=In a Corrupt World Where the Violent Bear It Away|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/movies/17kehr.html|accessdate=2012-06-10|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2008}}</ref>

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] has cited ''Mandingo'' as one of only two instances "in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation movie]]," comparing it to ''[[Showgirls]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Udovitch |first=Mim |editor=Peary, Gerald |title=Quentin Tarantino: Interviews |year=1998 |publisher=Univ.
