'''Matthew McCauley''' (July 11, 1850 &ndash; October 25, 1930) was the first [[mayor]] of the [[city]] of [[Edmonton]], and a member of the legislative assemblies of both the [[List of Northwest Territories Legislative Assemblies|Northwest Territories]] and [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta]].

McCauley was born into a farming family at what later became the province of [[Ontario]] to an Irish father and Canadian mother. His restless nature and desire for adventure led him to travel west to Manitoba. In Manitoba, he established a livery business, which he ran until he set off for Edmonton in 1879. He farmed for two years in Fort Saskatchewan before finally moving to Edmonton, where he established the settlement's first livery and cartage business.

Along with a couple prominent Edmonton citizens, he formed an association aimed to restore order in the area, settling many disputes, including during the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] as its captain. He soon established a school board, recognizing the need for a school, which he served as president and trustee for 18 years.  Shortly before Edmonton was incorporated as a town in 1892, he formed the Board of Trade. Upon the incorporation, he was acclaimed the town's first mayor in 1892, and the next two following years. He did not run for re-election at the end of his third term, opting to run for the seat representing Edmonton on the Territorial Legislature, which he served for six years. Following his defeat moved to [[Tofield, Alberta]] farm until 1905, when he returned to Edmonton and was elected to the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The following year, he resigned his seat to serve as the first warden of the province's first penitentiary. After five years as warden, he moved to [[British Columbia]] to fruit farm, but he moved back to Sexsmith, Alberta 13 years later to farm, where he died in 1930.

==Early life==
Matthew McCauley was born July 11, 1850 in [[Owen Sound]], [[Ontario]] to Alexander and Eleanor ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Latimer) McCauley.<ref name="bolwer">{{harvnb|Bolwer|1968|p=11}}</ref> His father Alexander was an Irish immigrant who was born in [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. He moved to [[Canada]] at the age of five, and went on to become a successful farmer.<ref name="bolwer" /><ref name="macrae525">{{harvnb|MacRae|1912|p=525}}</ref> Though his early years were described as him being a "typical farm boy" of the time, he received schooling from the Owen Sound Public School. McCauley desired to follow in the footsteps of this father as a farmer after his completing his education, but his restless nature and passion for adventure set him off to the [[Western Canada|west]], where he first set off to [[Fort Garry]] in [[Manitoba]].<ref name="bolwer" />

McCauley established a [[livery]] business, the first of the kind in [[Fort Garry]] (later [[Winnipeg]]). He married Matilda Benson of [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] in 1875, and resided in Fort Garry with her for the next four years, where he continued to operate his livery business. After growing restless in Winnipeg in 1879, McCauley sold his business and traveled west once again, this time to [[Edmonton]]. McCauley arrived in Edmonton in the fall of 1879 after 21 days of travelling by [[Bullock cart|ox cart]].<ref name="keane2">{{harvnb|Keane|1913|p=2}}</ref> He purchased a farm in [[Fort Saskatchewan]] the following spring, and farmed for two years before moving to Edmonton in 1882.<ref name="bolwer" /> In Edmonton, he opened the town's first livery and cartage business, the Edmonton Cartage Company, and a [[butcher]] shop in 1883.<ref name="biographi" />

===Protective Association===
McCauley arrived in Edmonton at the time of what has been described "one of the biggest conflicts ever." The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] has recently surveyed lots of land that were intended to be sold as property, however word broke out that the particular are of land was the only land surveyed in the entire district. People attracted to the area were unable to afford land, and therefore built shacks.<ref name="avdes3">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=3}}</ref> As more [[Land claim|claim-jumpers]] moved in, it was requested that they move three or four miles outwards, but they refused. McCauley sent many urgent messages to [[Ottawa]] to settle the dispute in a civil manner, but to no avail. As a result of the government not being able to do anything, and the lack of a law enforcement agency in the town, a group of prominent citizens formed a "Protective Association" as an attempt to restore law and order, to which McCauley was elected its captain.<ref name="keane3"/>

As captain, McCauley tried hard to settle the dispute and reach a compromise with the claim-jumpers who "head no desire for a peaceful settlement." He was involved in a brief altercation with a claim jumper whom he approached and ordered to move. The man was armed with two [[revolver]]s and refused to move, therefore McCauley and his crew jacked the shack off its foundation and sent it down the riverbank.<ref name="macrae526">{{harvnb|MacRae|1912|p=526}}</ref>  The Protective Association, however was involved in a legal problems brought up by the claim jumpers, for "willful damage to property." The brief trial resulted in McCauley, as the captain being fined 40 dollars, and six other members of the committee found guilty, but being let off with court costs and an order to replace the damaged property. The Protective Association eventually managed to restore peace and order in Edmonton, and claim jumpers eventually decided that the area was not the place to build on once the land for the townsite was surveyed by the Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name="avdes4">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=4}}</ref><ref name="realestateweekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/news/2004/02/12/matthew-mccauley-a-man-of-justice-civic-commitment-and-leadership |title=Matthew McCauley: A Man of Justice, Civic Commitment and Leadership &#124; Real Estate Weekly |publisher=Rewedmonton.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>

===Edmonton School Board===
[[File:Matthew McCauley - 1910.jpg|right|thumb|upright|McCauley in 1910 as a member of the school board]]
After realizing Edmonton as a suitable place for raising his children, McCauley soon recognized the community's need for a school.<ref name="avdes5">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=5}}</ref> McCauley led a group of prominent men and arranged for a school to be built on land donated by the Hudson's Bay Company.<ref name="biographi" /> The school opened in on January 2, 1882.<ref name="avdes5" /> Three years after the opening of the school, McCauley found himself and a small group of people paying off bills for the school. Initially, McCauley suggested that land owners be taxed with the funds going to the school, but protest followed. McCauley then decided to propose that Edmonton be designated as an official school district by the government in Ottawa, which was voted in favor of following a close vote.<ref>{{harvnb|Keane|1913|p=4}}</ref> The school district was successfully negotiated with Ottawa, and it became the first of its kind in the North-West Territories.<ref name="avdes7">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=7}}</ref> Edmonton became known as having the "finest school system in the west of [[Portage La Prairie]]" that set an example for many other following cities.<ref name="keane5">{{harvnb|Keane|1913|p=5}}</ref> McCauley served as chairman of the newly formed School Board from 1885 to 1888, when he stepped down, although he served as a trustee for 18 years following.<ref name="macrae526" /> He was nicknamed "Edmonton's Father of Education" in honour of his efforts to bring an education system to the community.<ref name="avdes7"/>

===Rebellion of 1885===
During the [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] in 1885, news of the [[Frog Lake Massacre]] spread to Edmonton, invoking fear to many residents.<ref name="bolw15" /> McCauley, concerned for citizens of the town, quickly responded by organizing a group of men into what was known as the "Home Guard," which formed a [[Security guard|sentry]] that ensured security from possible attacks, until the arrival of additional military protection.<ref name="macrae526" /><ref name="keane5" />

==Political career==
[[File:Matt McCauley Old Timers.jpeg|thumb|180px|right|McCauley in 1905]]
===Mayor of Edmonton===
In 1889, McCauley co-founded (with [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]] and [[John Alexander McDougall]]) the Edmonton Board of Trade, forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce.<ref name="biographi" /><ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|1987|p=170}}</ref>

When Edmonton was incorporated as a town on January 9, 1892, it held its first election in [[Edmonton municipal election, 1892|1892]] with McCauley acclaimed as mayor as no other candidates had put their names forth.<ref name="ej2004" /> Among his concerns during his first term were to "establish order" among the scattered shacks near the trading post, and widening various streets around the town, in preparation for what he envisioned in the future of Edmonton becoming a "busy metropolitan".<ref name="avdes10">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=8}}</ref> He was re-acclaimed in [[Edmonton municipal election, 1893|1893]] and [[Edmonton municipal election, 1894|1894]]<ref name="ej2004" /> before stepping aside voluntarily after his third term, never having been contested in an election. During his term as mayor, the Canadian government decided to move the Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, which was then a separate community, on the south side of the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. Upon the arrival of government agents to carry out the move, citizens quickly set up a resistance. Headed by McCauley and a group of prominent citizens including councillor [[John Cameron (Alberta politician)|John Cameron]], Angry Edmontonians descended on the office, cut horses loose and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer was packing with records for transportation. The situation escalated quickly, becoming heated, from which McCauley called on the people to relent as they would request reconsideration from Ottawa. Later that same day, the decision was reversed.<ref>{{harvnb|Bolwer|1968|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=66&dat=19140414&id=dKIkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2CcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5954,5015360|newspaper=The Toronto Sunday World|date=April 14, 1914|page=12|title=Retired to Enjoy Remaining Days. Robt. McCauley,[sic] First Mayor of Edmonton Had Interesting Career.|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> In 1893, he went to [[Ottawa]] to enter negotiations with the federal government for a street railway system. McCauley was successful, and the system became the first in the west.<ref name="macrae527">{{harvnb|MacRae|1912|p=527}}</ref> He also advocated for federal government assistance in building a railway bridge over the [[North Saskatchewan River]] for the existing Edmonton-Calgary rail connection, which would be completed in 1900.<ref name="biographi" /> McCauley also saw Edmonton's need for a hospital, and consequently established what later became [[Grey Nuns Community Hospital|Grey Nuns Hospital]], arranging for the Grey Nuns to establish at the town, along with a nurse.<ref name="avdes11">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=11}}</ref>

In [[Edmonton municipal election, January 1896|1896]], McCauley sought election to [[Edmonton Town Council|Town Council]] once again, this time as alderman.  He was easily elected, finishing first of eight candidates in an election in which the top six were elected.  He served a single term, and did not seek re-election [[Edmonton municipal election, December 1896|the following election]].
===Territorial and provincial===
Following his decision not to run for re-election as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be [[Edmonton (N.W.T. electoral district)|Edmonton]]'s representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry.<ref name="avdes13">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=13}}</ref> He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system,<ref>{{harvnb|Allan|1975|p=2}}</ref> introducing a [[single tax]] bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax.<ref name="macrae527" />

In 1901, McCauley sold Edmonton Cartage Company and used the proceeds to buy one thousand acres (4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of farmland at [[Beaverhill Lake|Beaver Lake]], near [[Tofield, Alberta]],<ref name="macrae525" /><ref name="ej2004">{{cite news |title=Town's first mayor left indelible mark |author=David Howell |newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]] |date=October 3, 2004 |url= |page= |volume= |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref> where he farmed until returning to Edmonton in 1905.<ref name="keane3">{{harvnb|Keane|1913|p=3}}</ref>  While in Tofield, he married Annie Cookson - his first wife, Matilda, had died in 1896 - with whom he had four children, bringing his total to twelve.<ref name="avdes13"/>

Upon Alberta becoming a province in 1905, McCauley returned to Edmonton and was elected as a [[Liberal Party of Alberta|Liberal]] member to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in the riding of [[Vermilion (provincial electoral district)|Vermilion]] in the province's [[Alberta general election, 1905|first general election]]. During his tenure, he had introduced  many bills to the house, and advocated for a university to be founded.<ref name="avdes14">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1992|p=14}}</ref>

McCauley played a vital role in Edmonton being chosen as the provincial capital city. In a speech, he pointed out the ongoing development at the northern town of [[Peace River, Alberta]], and how Edmonton would be the "logical centre of the province".<ref name="avdes14" />

==Later career==
[[File:Warden Matthew McCauley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|McCauley as the warden of the Edmonton Penitentiary.]]
McCauley resigned his seat in the Legislature the following year after he was elected, after his appointment to be warden of the Edmonton Penitentiary, the first of its kind in Alberta. It was said that his reputation of "honesty, fairness and ability to keep law and order" was a contributing factor in his appointment. In he years he served in the capacity, McCauley instituted a number of new practices, including creating [[Manual labour|labour]] jobs for prisoners, like producing [[bricks]], [[concrete]], [[clothing]] and tools. Prisoners were also to garden to produce their own food, and by the end of his tenure as warden, a [[coal]] mine was formed.<ref name="biographi">{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mccauley_matthew_15E.html |title=Biography <U+2013> McCAULEY, MATTHEW <U+2013> Volume XV (1921<U+2013>1930) <U+2013> Dictionary of Canadian Biography |publisher=Biographi.ca |date=1930-10-26 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> He was greatly respected amongst his colleagues, and it was said that "he never once had a complaint against him from either staff nor inmates."<ref name="avdes14" />

McCauley resigned as warden in 1912 to become a fruit farmer in [[Penticton]] in the [[Okanagan]] valley.<ref name="avdes15">{{harvnb|Aylen-van de Sande|1993|p=15}}</ref> After thirteen years farming in Penticton, he moved to [[Sexsmith, Alberta]] to farm on a recently-bought 1000 acre farm.<ref name="avdes15" />
