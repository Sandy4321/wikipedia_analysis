'''Jaffa''' (  [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''<U+05D9><U+05B8><U+05E4><U+05D5><U+05B9>''', '''Yafo'''  [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''<U+064A><U+064E><U+0627><U+0641><U+064E><U+0627>''' 
{{Audio|ArJaffa.ogg|'''Y<U+0101>f<U+0101>'''}}; also '''Japho''', '''Joppa'''; also, ~1350 B.C.E. [[Amarna Letters]]: '''Yapu'''; ), is an ancient [[port city]] located in south [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

It is mentioned four times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], as one of the cities given to the [[Tribe of Dan]] ([[Book of Joshua]] 19:46), as port-of-entry for the [[Lebanon Cedar|cedars of Lebanon]] for [[Solomon's Temple]] ([[2 Chronicles]] 2:16), as the place whence the prophet [[Jonah]] embarked for [[Tarshish]] ([[Book of Jonah]] 1:3) and as port-of-entry for the cedars of Lebanon for the [[Second Temple]] of Jerusalem ([[Book of Ezra]] 3:7). It was also an important city in the Arab Middle East. During the [[Crusade]]s, it was the [[County of Jaffa]], a stronghold of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

The city is part of the [[Tel Aviv Jaffa]]; the ''[[tell]]'' ("mound") of ancient Jaffa in "Old Jaffa" is part of a park in south-western Tel Aviv.

==History==
=== Name sources ===
Jaffa (or ''Yafo'') is one of the most ancient port cities in the world. Some claim that Jaffa was named after [[Japheth]], one of the three sons of [[Noah]], who built it after the [[Great Flood]]. A [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] etymology indicates that the city is called Jaffa because of its beauty (''yofi'' in Hebrew). The [[Hellenist]] tradition links the name to "Iopeia", which is [[Boast of Cassiopeia|Cassiopeia]], the mother of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. However, the Hellenist accounting for the name dates from hundreds of years after the original naming. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

=== Ancient period ===
The ancient site of Jaffa is ''[[Tell|Tel]] Yafo'', or "Jaffa Hill," which rises to a height of 40-meter (130 ft) and offers a commanding view of the coastline. Hence its strategic importance in military history. At the foot of the hill were springs of fresh water. The accumulation of debris and landfill over the centuries made the hill even higher.  

Jaffa's natural harbor has been in use since the [[Bronze Age]]. It is mentioned in an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian letter from [[1470 BC]], glorifying its conquest by [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]], who hid armed warriors in large baskets and gave the baskets as a present to the [[Canaan]]ite city's governor. The city is also mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] under its Egyptian name ''Ya-Pho'', ('' Ya-Pu, EA 296, l.33''). In 1991, a replica of the Egyptian gate lintels, bearing the titles of Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], was re-erected on its original site. The city was under Egyptian rule until around [[800 BC]].

Jaffa is mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]] as the territorial border of the [[Tribe of Dan]], hence the term "Gush Dan," used today for the coastal plain. Many descendants of [[Dan (biblical figure)|Dan]] lived along the coast and earned their living from shipmaking and sailing. In the "Song of [[Deborah]]" the prophetess asks: "<U+05D3><U+05DF> <U+05DC><U+05DE><U+05D4> <U+05D9><U+05D2><U+05D5><U+05E8> <U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05EA>": "Why doth Dan dwell in ships?" <!-- NOTE "Yagur" here is future tense in construction, but (as is not uncommon in biblical Hebrew) present tense in meaning (or even past tense, possibly, in this case). In Biblical Hebrew, future tense is often used to indicate that the action is repeated or habitual, not to indicate that the action has yet to occur. -->
<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0705.htm Judges 5:17]</ref> 
 
[[King David]] and his son [[King Solomon]] conquered Jaffa and used its port to bring the [[cedar]]s used in the construction of the [[First Temple]] from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. The city remained in [[Jew]]ish hands even after the split of the [[Kingdom of Israel]]. In [[701 BC]], in the days of [[Hezekiah|King Hezekiah]] (<U+05D7><U+05D6><U+05E7><U+05D9><U+05D4><U+05D5>),  [[Sennacherib]], king of [[Assyria]], invaded the region from Jaffa. 

Jaffa was a [[Seleucid]] port until it was taken over by the [[Maccabees|Maccabean]] rebels ([[1 Maccabees]] x.76, xiv.5). In the Roman suppression of the [[Jewish Revolt]], Jaffa was captured and burned by [[Cestius Gallus]]. The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]] writes that eight thousand inhabitants were massacred. [[Pirate]]s operating from the rebuilt port incurred the wrath of [[Vespasian]], who razed the city and erected a [[citadel]] in its place, installing a Roman garrison there.

The [[New Testament]] account of [[St. Peter's]] resurrection of the widow [[Tabitha]],  ([[Dorcas]]) ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], ix, 36-42) takes place in Jaffa. St. Peter later had a vision in which God told him not to distinguish between Jews and Gentiles and between kosher and non-kosher (Acts, x, 10-16). This vision heralded a major ideological split between [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. A painting in St. Peters, a Roman Catholic church in Jaffa, commemorates this event.

===Medieval period===
[[Image:Saladin attakcs Jaffa crusades.jpg|thumb|300px|Saladin's attack on Jaffa]]
Unimportant during the first centuries of [[Christianity]], Jaffa did not have a [[bishop]] until the fifth century AD. In 636 Jaffa was conquered by Arabs. Under Islamic rule, it served as a port of [[Ramla]], then the provincial capital.

Jaffa was captured during the [[Crusade]]s, and became the County of Jaffa and Ascalon, one of the [[vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. One of its counts, [[John of Ibelin (jurist)|John of Ibelin]], wrote the principal book of the Assizes of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. During the period of the Crusades, the Jewish traveller [[Benjamin of Tudela]] (1170) sojourned at Jaffa, and found there just one Jew, a dyer by trade. [[Saladin]] took it in [[1187]]. The city surrendered to [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]] on [[September 10]], [[1191]], three days after the death of mongou [[Battle of Arsuf]]. Despite efforts by Saladin to reoccupy the city in July 1192 the city remained in the hands of the Crusaders, and on 2nd Septemer 1192 the Treaty of Jaffa was formally sworn, guaranteeing a three year truce between the two armies. In 1268 Jaffa was conquered by Egyptian [[mamluk]]s, led by [[Baibars]]. In 14th century they completely destroyed the city for fear of new crusades. According to the traveler Cotwyk, Jaffa was a heap of ruins at the end of the 16th century.

=== The Ottoman period === 
On [[March 7]], [[1799]] [[Napoleon I of France]] captured Jaffa and his troops proceeded to kill more than two thousand [[Albania]]n captives.

Jaffa was well known for its cash crops such as [[citrus]] and [[banana]]s. Until the establishment of [[Tel Aviv]] and the era of the [[Palestine (mandate)|Mandate for Palestine]], Jaffa had the most advanced commercial, banking, fishing, and agriculture industries in Palestine. It had many factories specializing in cigarette making, cement making, tile and roof tile production, iron casting, cotton processing plants, traditional handmade carpets, leather products, wood boxes for [[Jaffa orange]]s, textiles, presses and publications. The majority of all publications and newspapers in Palestine were published in Jaffa.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, the population of Jaffa had swelled considerably and new suburbs were built on the sand dunes along the coast. By 1909, the new Jewish suburbs north of Jaffa were reorganized as the city of [[Tel Aviv]].

[[Image:Kook_color.jpg|right|framed|Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] was [[chief rabbi]] of Jaffa from [[1904]]-[[1921]].]]
In [[1904]] [[Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] ([[1864]]-[[1935]]) moved to [[Palestine]] and took up the position of [[chief rabbi]] of Jaffa:

:''In 1904, he came to the Land of Israel to assume the rabbinical post in Jaffa, which also included responsibility for the new secular Zionist agricultural settlements nearby. His influence on people in different walks of life was already noticeable, as he attempted to introduce [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]] into the life of the city and the settlements.''<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Rav_Kook.html Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook], Jewish Virtual Library.</ref>

In [[1917]], the Ottomans banished all of Jaffa's residents as they feared the British army would occupy the city. The British did indeed occupy the city (see [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]), but let its residents return after a year.

=== Under the British mandate ===
During 1917-1920, there were thousands of Jewish residents in Jaffa. A wave of Arab [[pogrom]] attacks during [[1920]] and [[1921]] caused many Jewish residents to flee and resettle in [[Tel Aviv]]. The [[Jaffa riots|1921 riots]] (known as the ''Meoraot Tarpa'' by the Jews) began with a [[May Day]] parade that turned violent. The Arab rioters attacked Jewish people and buildings, including the residents of "The House of Immigrants" and the Jewish author [[Yosef Haim Brenner]].

In [[1921]] Rabbi Kook moved to [[Jerusalem]] when he was appointed as the first [[Ashkenazi]] chief rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine and is still regarded as Israel's first chief rabbi as well.

At the end of [[1922]] Jaffa had 32,000 residents while Tel Aviv had 15,000. However, in [[1927]], Tel Aviv had 38,000 residents. The Jews of Jaffa lived on the outskirts of Jaffa, close to Tel Aviv. The old city of Jaffa, which was controlled by the Arabs, was almost empty of Jews. During the 1930s both cities had a combined population of 80,000 residents.
In 1945, Arabs planted 146,316 [[dunam]]s (146 km<U+00B2>) of citrus, and Jews planted 66,403 dunams (66 km<U+00B2>).

The [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], also known as the Great Arab uprising, inflicted great economic and infrastructural damage on Jaffa. [[Urban warfare]] between the British forces and Arab resistance destroyed many of the city's narrow alleys. The British demolished many houses belonging to Arab resistance. Jewish and British citizens moved their businesses out of Jaffa. As a reaction to the strike of the Arab [[seaport]] workers, the Jews built a modern seaport in [[Tel Aviv]], which resulted in decreased income for Jaffa's Arab seaport.

=== The 1948 Arab-Israeli War ===
{{POV check}}
Prior to the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the [[UN]]'s Special Commission on Palestine in 1947 recommended that Jaffa become part of the planned Jewish state. However, due to the large Arab majority it was instead designated as an Arab enclave in the Jewish state in the [[1947 UN Partition Plan]].

The Arabs rejected the plan and on [[30 November]], 1947, the day following the adoption of the UN resolution, seven Jews were killed by Arabs in Palestine in three separate incidents: at 8 o'clock in the morning, in what came to be seen as the opening shots of the 1948 War,<ref>Benevisti, 2002, p. 101.</ref> three Arabs attacked a bus from [[Netanya]] to [[Jerusalem]], killing five Jewish passengers. Half an hour later a second bus attack left a Jewish passenger dead. Later in the day a twenty-five-year old Jewish man was shot dead in Jaffa,<ref>Gilbert, 1998, p. 155.</ref> where there were alleged attacks on Arabs by Jews.<ref>'7 Jews Murdered', ''The Palestine Post'', [[1 December]], 1947, p. 1.</ref> In Jerusalem, the [[Arab Higher Committee]] called a three-day general strike from Tuesday, [[December 2]] to be followed by mass demonstrations after Friday prayers.

From the beginning of the strike onwards, Arab and Jewish clashes escalated and by [[December 11]] the Jerusalem correspondent of ''The Times'' estimated that at least 130 people had died, "about 70 of them being Jews, 50 Arabs, and among the rest three British soldiers and one British policeman". <ref>'Fighting in Jerusalem', ''The Times'', [[12 December]], 1947, p. 4; Issue 50942; col E.</ref>

On [[April 25]], [[1948]], [[Irgun]] launched an offensive on Jaffa, then the largest Arab city in Palestine, during which many of its Arab residents fled through the harbor. [[Haganah]] units took the city on [[May 14]]. From a population of about 70,000-80,000 Arabs, only about 4,100 did not flee.<ref>Morris, 2003, pp. 211-221.</ref> To commemorate the Jewish soldiers who died in the battle for Jaffa, the "Conquest Garden" was planted in the city.

== Modern Jaffa ==
{{Unreferenced|date=July 2006}}
With the massive arrival of many Jewish immigrants from [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]], [[Romania]], [[Iraq]], [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]] and other countries, they were settled all over [[Israel]], Jaffa included. Severely damaged during Arab uprising and the 1948 War, Jaffa's Al Ajami neighborhood slowly turned into a slum. Jaffa in those days had the reputation of a "crime city".

In 1954, Jaffa became integral part of the municipality of [[Tel Aviv]], and since then both cities are known as Tel Aviv-Yafo. Currently, Jaffa's Old City neighbourhood is being renovated, and is inhabited mostly by artists.

Modern Jaffa has a [[heterogeneous]] population of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Jaffa's Arab population now numbers around 10,000 people. Jaffa is a major tourist attraction with an exciting combination of old, new and restored. It offers art galleries, theaters, souvenir shops, exclusive restaurants, sidewalk cafes, boardwalks and shopping opportunities and a rich variety of culture, entertainment and food.

===Jaffa beyond the Old City===
{{POV check}}
Most tourists visit only Jaffa's Old City, Port and the [[Flea Market]], being completely unaware of the rest of Jaffa: Al Ajami, Yafo Gimmel, Yafo Daled, Neve Ofer and Lev Yafo. Jaffa, with its proud 5000 year old history as a town of importance and cultural center, has become a poor district of Tel Aviv.

Although there has been some gentrification in Al Ajami and Lev Yafo (as a result the housing prices in Ajami have soared and young families are unable to obtain housing), Jaffa is characterised by poverty. The public education system for Arab speaking children has a 53% drop out rate. Quite a few of those who finish high school, do so without a matriculation certificate (''[[bagrut]]''), some unable to read and write. The Hebrew-speaking public educational system is not much better. As a result, parents who can afford it send their children to schools in Tel Aviv or to the private Christian schools.

Some new and fairly good schools have been established: "The Democratic School" (private, Jewish) and the "Jaffa School" (Arabic speaking, run by Jaffa's "Alrabita". Other old and good ones are: "Tabeetha" (English speaking, private and run by "The Church Of Scotland"), "Fraire" (French speaking, private) and "Terra Santa" (private, Arabic speaking and run by the Catholic Church).

Jaffa's Arab population allegedly experiences severe problems when looking for a job and those qualified are often discriminated against. Many, due to poor schooling, do not qualify in the first place. As a result, unemployment and poverty rates soar. Many Arab residents of Jaffa are dependent on welfare. Today's Jaffa is characterised by severe drug problems, high crime rates and very high violence rates. Some Arab residents have alleged that the Israeli authorities are attempting to Judiaze Jaffa by evicting Arab residients from houses owned by the [[Amidar (Company)|Amidar]] government-operated public housing company. Amidar respresentatives claim that the residents are invaders who are illegally squatting in those houses.<ref> [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853180.html Protesters rally in Jaffa against move to evict local Arab families] 28/4/07, Haaretz</ref>

Jaffa's Jewish population includes the "old timers", mostly the 2nd generation of the immigrants settled in Jaffa during the fifties and sixties of the last century, and newcomers. Some of the newcomers are extremely well to do. They bought and renovated old houses. Others, in Yafo Gimmel, Daled and Neve Ofer, are more recent immigrants, mostly from former Soviet States. More than a few are rather poor and live in cramped, bad quality, public housing.

Members of the Arab as well as significant parts of its more politically astute and historically aware population have argued that the Arab past of the "Bride of the Sea" has been blurred by the Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality. In the early 1950s, after 95% of the Arab population had left in, with the onset of mass Jewish immigration into Jaffa, almost all Arab street names were replaced by Jewish ones. However, from the 1990s onwards, efforts have been made to renew Arab and Islamic monuments (such as the Mosque of the Sea  and [[Hassan Bek Mosque]]) and document the history of Jaffa's Arab population.
