'''Niko Niko's Greek & American Caf<U+00E9>''' (more commonly known as '''Niko Niko's''') is a restaurant located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] known for serving [[Greek cuisine]]. Chrisanthios Fetokakis opened the restaurant in 1977, and ownership was eventually passed on to his son, Diminti Fetokakis.

==History==
According to Niko Niko's official site, Chrisanthios Fetokakis opened a walk-up window restaurant on May 1, 1977, earning $15 the first day it operated.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://nikonikos.com/en-us/193/history.aspx|title=History|publisher=Niko Niko's|accessdate=July 9, 2010|pages=1<U+2013>5}}</ref> After an initial struggle to open, Fetokakis received assistance from Pete Pappas of the [[Pappas Restaurants]] franchise.<ref name=History/> Eventually, Fetokakis' son Dimitri became owner of the restaurant. Dimitri considered Pappas a life-long mentor, and was saddened by his death in 2005.<ref name=Pappas>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/3538951.html|title=Co-founder of Pappas Restaurants dies|date=December 21, 2005|accessdate=July 9, 2010|first=Nicki|last=Britton|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]}}</ref>

In 2005, owner Dimitri Fetokakis began landscaping the median across from the restaurant as part of a commitment to Montrose Boulevard Conservancy's "beautification" project.<ref name=Friedberg>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nb/heights/news/5144783.html|first=Jennifer|last=Friedberg|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation|date=September 18, 2007|accessdate=July 9, 2010|title=Plans being made for Montrose Blvd.'s revitalization}}</ref> Before the Houston recycling program known as RecycleBank went into effect in 2009, Niko Niko's used [[polystyrene]] plates, bowls, and cups to serve food and drinks. Since the program's implementation,  Fetokakis made the decision to switch to more environmentally-friendly (though also more expensive) "enviroware" plates and degradable plastic bags.<ref name=Recycling>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/casey/6721119.html|title=Niko the Greek bets on recycling|date=November 14, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010|first=Rick|last=Casey|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation}}</ref> Houston residents participating in the incentive program can earn points for recycling and redeem them at the restaurant.<ref name=KRIV>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/news/consumer/091020_city_recycle_rewards_houston|title=City to Reward Recyclers with Prizes|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010|publisher=[[KRIV]]|first=Doug|last=DeLony}}</ref>

After more than 30 years of doing business from only the Montrose location, Niko Niko's expanded in 2010 by adding a kiosk in Market Square Park in [[downtown Houston]].<ref name=Downtown>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/othercities/houston/stories/2010/04/26/tidbits1.html?b=1272254400^3235291&s=industry&i=sports_business|title=Niko Niko's spins gyros downtown|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010|work=[[Orlando Business Journal]]|publisher=American City Business Journals}}</ref> The 375 square foot "sidewalk cafe-style operation" focuses on "to-go" foods such as gyro sandwiches, shish kabobs and hummus.<ref name=Downtown/><ref name=Morago>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/forkandcork/2010/04/montrose_icon_niko_nikos_to_ex_1.html|title=Montrose icon Niko Niko's to expand to downtown's Market Square |first=Greg|last=Morago|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010|work=Houston Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation}}</ref>

==Reception==
In a 2010 review, Amber Ambrose of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' criticized the restaurant's Athenian Mushroom Burger, but conceited that "no rain nor sleet nor snow and now no dry burger could ever keep Niko Niko's off the Houston favorites list".<ref name=Ambrose>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/2010/04/what_not_to_order_at_niko_niko.php|title=What Not to Order at Niko Niko's: Athenian Mushroom Burger|first=Amber|last=Ambrose|work=Houston Press|publisher=Village Voice Media|date=April 9, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref>
