'''Konstanty Jodko-Narkiewicz''', also known as '''Konstanty Narkiewicz-Jodko''' (1901<U+2013>1963), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Geophysics|geophysicist]] who specialized in studying [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]]. He was also a [[mountain]]eer, [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorer]], and [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloonist]].

==Early life==
Jodko-Narkiewicz, born in 1901 at [[Pi<U+0144>cz<U+00F3>w]],<ref name=enctat>Zofia Radwa<U+0144>ska-Paryska, Witold H.

Antoni Jodko-Narkiewicz (1843<U+2013>1892) was an [[history of art|art historian]], Jakub Jodko-Narkiewicz (1848<U+2013>1905) a physicist specializing in [[electromagnetism]], and also a photographer, Leon Jodko-Narkiewicz the city [[architect]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Krakow]] in the middle of the 19th century. One Witold Jodko-Narkiewicz (1834<U+2013>1898) was an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]], while another Witold (1864<U+2013>1924) was a [[diplomat]] and [[journalist]] who in 1892 was one of the founders of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].<ref>[http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/biography.htm Biography of Christian Narkiewicz-Laine] online at chi-athenaeum.org</ref>

==Geophysicist==
Jodko-Narkiewicz trained in [[natural sciences]] and [[geography]], gaining a [[doctorate]] in [[physics]]. Professionally he specialized in the study of [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]].<ref>[http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/76580,,,,narkiewicz_jodko_konstanty,haslo.html Narkiewicz-Jodko Konstanty] at portalwiedzy.onet.pl (in Polish)</ref><ref name=gemb/> In the 1930s, he was an assistant at the Physical Institute of [[Warsaw University]].

He found a happy marriage between his career as a physicist and his interest in climbing. For instance, he combined a climbing expedition to the Andes in 1934 with a project to measure [[geomagnetism|geomagnetic effects]] on cosmic rays.<ref>Nick Ellis, M. Bel<U+00E9>n Gavela, ''1993 European School of High-Energy Physics: Zakopane, Poland, 12-25 September 1993: proceedings, Issue 4'' (1994), p. 246</ref>

==Mountaineer==
An experienced [[alpinism|alpinist]], Jodko-Narkiewicz also climbed mountains in [[Africa]] and [[Spitsbergen]].<ref name=tatry/><ref name=gemb>Jerzy Gembicki, Zbigniew Mitzner, ''Wzd<U+0142>u<U+017C> dalekiego brzegu: wyb<U+00F3>r reporta<U+017C>y z lat mi<U+0119>dzywojennych'' (1966), [http://books.google.com/books?id=kNIBAAAAMAAJ&q=Konstanty+%22Narkiewicz-Jodko%22&dq=Konstanty+%22Narkiewicz-Jodko%22&hl=en&ei=6wjfTPXnBcHPhAfx4PmfDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAzge p. 737] online at books.google.com</ref>

In 1929 he climbed the glacier [[Langj<U+00F6>kull]], in [[Iceland]].<ref>Jacek Grzyma<U+0142>a, [http://www.islandia.org.pl/rozwoj.html ROZW<U+00D3>J TURYSTYKI NA ISLANDII] at islandia.org.pl (in Polish)</ref>

In 1933<U+2013>1934 he led a Polish expedition organized by the [[PTTK|Tatra Society]] to the [[Andes]], beginning with the [[Cordillera de la Ramada]], a [[mountain range]] in [[Argentina]]. The party included Stefan W. Daszynski, Jan K. Dorawski, Wiktor Ostrowski, Adam Karpi<U+0144>ski, meteorologist and equipment designer, and Stefan Osiecki, cameraman, and it made the [[first ascent]]s of [[Mercedario]], [[Alma Negra]], [[Pico Polaco]], [[La Mesa (mountain)|La Mesa]], and [[Cerro Ramada]], then proceeded south to climb the better-known [[Aconcagua]], the [[Extremes of Altitude|highest mountain]] in the [[Americas]].<ref>S. W. Daszynski, 'A Polish Expedition to the High Andes', in ''The Geographical Journal'', vol. 84, no. 3 ([[Royal Geographical Society]], September 1934), pp. 215-223; [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1785755 article online at jstor.org] (subscription needed)</ref> The [[Polish Glacier]] of Aconcagua was named after this expedition, which originated an alternative route to the peak along the [[glacier]].<ref>J. Neate, ''Mountaineering in the Andes'' (1994, ISBN 0-907649-64-5), p. 187</ref>

In 1936, with Stanislaw Siedlecki and Stefan Bernadzikiewicz, he took part in a Polish expedition which crossed West Spitsbergen from south to north.<ref>Stanislaw Siedlecki, ''Crossing West Spitsbergen from South to North'',  [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a792205745 abstract] at informaworld.com</ref> Covering 850 kilometres, the three men made the first complete traverse of Spitsbergen.<ref>Adolf Szponar, ''Results of investigations of the Polish Scientific Spitsbergen Expeditions'', vol. 4 (1982), [http://books.google.com/books?id=tWBFAAAAYAAJ&q=%22K.+Narkiewicz-Jodko%22&dq=%22K.+Narkiewicz-Jodko%22&hl=en&ei=7RHfTOfzIMrAhAfRh4GzDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw snippet] online at books.google.com</ref>

==Balloonist==
Considering his interests in cosmic rays and mountaineering, it was a natural development for Narkiewicz-Jodko to take to the skies as a balloonist. A high point in this area of his career came on March 29, 1936, when with a scientific colleague he succeeded in taking the balloon ''Warszawa II'' ('Warsaw II') up to a height of 10,000 [[metre]]s for the purpose of scientific measurements.<ref>S. Ziemecki & K. Narkiewicz-Jodko, 'Continuous Variation of Cosmic Ray Intensity in the Higher Layers of the Troposphere', in ''Acad. Polonaise Sciences et Lettres'', bulletin no. 7a (July, 1936), pp. 318-326</ref>

===The ''Star of Poland'' incident===
{{Main|Gwiazda Polski}} 

On 14 October 1938, in the [[Tatra Mountains]], Jodko-Narkiewicz and [[Zbigniew Burzy<U+0144>ski|Captain Zbigniew Burzy<U+0144>ski]] attempted a [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] flight in the [[hydrogen]] [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] ''[[Gwiazda Polski|Star of Poland]]''. Their aim was to reach a height of thirty [[kilometre|km]], beating the world record for high-altitude flight, and they were equipped with a [[Geiger<U+2013>M<U+00FC>ller tube|Geiger-Mueller]] [[Geiger tube telescope|tube telescope]], intending to measure the variation in intensity of [[cosmic ray]]s at different [[altitude]]s. The balloon caught fire during take-off, while still less than one hundred feet above the ground, but the two men were able to land the [[Gondola (disambiguation)|gondola]] safely and were uninjured.<ref>Gregory P.

After this, there were no more high-altitude flights in the 1930s.<ref>Linda Voss, ''[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/race_to_strato/LTA11.htm The Race to the Stratosphere]'' online at centennialofflight.gov, accessed 13 November 2010</ref>

Jodko-Narkiewicz died at [[Psary, Ostr<U+00F3>w Wielkopolski County|Psary]], in the region of [[Greater Poland Voivodeship|Greater Poland]], in 1963.<ref name=enctat/>
