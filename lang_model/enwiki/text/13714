'''Nadya Denise Doud-Suleman''' (born '''Natalie Denise Suleman'''; July 11, 1975<ref>According to Family Tree Legends she was born in Orange County which supports Fullerton as her place of birth vs. Bellflower (Los Angeles County) which is sometimes reported. [http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461?c=search&first=&last=Suleman Natalie D.

One week after their birth, they surpassed the previous worldwide survival rate for a complete set of octuplets set by the [[Chukwu octuplets]] in 1998. The circumstances of their [[High order muliple birth|high order multiple birth]] have led to controversy in the field of [[assisted reproductive technology]] as well as an investigation by the [[Medical Board of California]] of the fertility specialist involved.<ref name="zaa">[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090206/ap_on_re_us/octuplets Octuplets' mom says she had 6 embryos implanted], ''Associated Press'', February 6, 2009</ref> 

Public reaction turned negative when it was discovered that Suleman already had six other young children and was unemployed and on [[welfare|public assistance]] programs. Suleman conceived the octuplets and her six older children via [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF).<ref name="solomonnyp">[http://www.nypost.com/seven/02112009/news/nationalnews/egg_on_his_face_154516.htm Egg on his face: Fertility Doc ripped by Octomom's Dad] [[New York Post]], February 11, 2009</ref> Although she initially denied ever having used public assistance,<ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/today-care-octomom-and-her-eight-toddlers-wreak-havoc-on-set-of-the-today-show/ Video at 1:20]</ref> she confirmed in April 2012 on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show that she was indeed on public assistance.

==Marriage and divorce==
In 1996, Suleman married Marco Gutierrez. They separated in 2000. Gutierrez filed for divorce in November 2006, which was finalized in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/octo-moms-ex-we-split-because-we-couldnt-have-kids-200933 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090304190701/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/octo-moms-ex-we-split-because-we-couldnt-have-kids-200933 |archivedate=2009-03-04 |title=Octuplet Mom's Ex: We Split Because We Couldn't Have Kids |accessdate=2011-07-10 }}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Inside Edition]]'' Gutierrez explained their divorce was due to failed attempts to have children. Suleman was desperate and wanted to try [[in-vitro fertilization]], but Gutierrez disliked the idea of [[test tube babies]] and refused to take part in the procedure. Gutierrez said he is not the father of any of Suleman's children and that he wishes his ex-wife the best.

Gutierrez later remarried and had two children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.insideedition.com/storyprint.aspx?SpecialReportID=2687 |title=Talking to Octomom Nadya Suleman's Ex-Husband|date=4 March 2009|work=[[Inside Edition]]|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Dodd | first = Johnny | title = Octuplets' Mom's Ex: Those Aren't My Kids | work = people.com | publisher = [[People (magazine)|People Weekly]] | date = Tuesday March 03, 2009 | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20262840,00.html | accessdate = }}</ref>

===Octuplets===
{{Main|Suleman octuplets}}
In 2008, Suleman stated she had six embryos left over from her previous IVF treatments. She explained at the time that she requested that all of the remaining embryos be implanted, despite the norm for a woman her age being two or three implanted at the most.<ref name="zaa"/> Suleman states that part of her reasoning for attempting a sixth pregnancy was so that the frozen embryos would not be destroyed. Supposedly, the six remaining embryos were implanted and two of the embryos split into twins, resulting in a total of eight embryos. Dr. Kamrava stated recently that she insisted on all 'fresh' cycles, and in fact she still has embryos stored with Dr. Kamrava.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/includes/misc/kamravaaccusation.pdf?loc=interstitialskip LAtimes.com], Kamrava Accusation</ref> In June 2011, during a California Medical Board investigation, it was found that Kamrava had implanted twelve embryos, which the board found to be an "extreme" departure from standard of care.<ref name="Dobuzinskis">{{cite news|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Octomom doctor loses California medical license|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/01/us-octomom-idUSTRE7507TL20110601?feedType=RSS|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=1 June 2011|date=June 1, 2011}}</ref> After reviewing Suleman's case, in combination with three other cases, the [[Medical Board of California]] voted to revoke Kamrava's medical license, effective July 1, 2011.<ref name="Dobuzinskis"/>

==Public profile==
Suleman quickly captured the public eye with the birth of octuplets. Within the first week, the media dubbed her "Octomom". Suleman hired the Killeen Furtney Group as her initial public relations company, with [[Wes Yoder]] providing a small amount of ''pro bono'' advice. Both groups soon ended their involvement after receiving death threats.<ref name="lat0215">[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-octuplets15-2009feb15,0,4935931.story Publicists for octuplets' mother quit over death threats], [[Los Angeles Times]], February 15, 2009</ref> Her next spokesman was Victor Munoz,<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jb5nkFDXdBnXzn1WEet3sHBt50Qw California octuplets mom passes on offer of 24-hour nursing care], The Canadian Press, February 28, 2009</ref> who quit on March 6, 2009.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Story?id=7034980&page=1 ABCnews.go.com]</ref>

Suleman has appeared on many television shows, starting with a February 2009 interview with [[Ann Curry]]. Suleman rejected suggestions that her decisions have been selfish or that she may not be able to care for her children, stating, "I know I'll be able to afford them when I'm done with my schooling. If I were just sitting down, watching TV and not being as determined as I am to succeed and provide a better future for my children, I believe that would be considered to a certainly degree selfish".<ref name="cnn6">[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/02/06/octuplets.mom/ Octuplets' mom: 'All I ever wanted'], ''CNN'', February 6, 2009</ref>  Suleman would later make another appearance later in March on ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' alongside fellow guest [[Gloria Allred]].

Her home in La Habra was set to go up for auction.

However, after visiting her house, [[social worker]]s determined that the children were not in danger and should not be removed.<ref name="octomom_bankrupcy">{{cite news |title=Octomom Nadya Suleman files for personal bankruptcy  |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/octomom-nadya-suleman-bankruptcy.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>
