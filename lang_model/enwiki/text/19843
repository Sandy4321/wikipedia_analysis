'''Frederick Lee "Ted" Petoskey''' (January 5, 1911 in {{city-state|St. Charles|Michigan}} <U+2013> November 30, 1996 in {{city-state|Elgin|South Carolina}}) was a three-sport athlete at the [[University of Michigan]], a [[Major League Baseball]] player, a collegiate coach in three sports and an [[athletic director]].  

At the [[University of Michigan]], Petoskey received eight [[varsity letter]]s in three sports.  In [[American football]], he was a two-time [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] [[End (football)|end]] for the undefeated [[Michigan Wolverines football]] teams that won back-to-back [[college football]] National Championships in 1932 and 1933.  He was also a guard and captain of Michigan's [[basketball]] team in the 1933&ndash;34 season.  As a [[baseball]] player in 1934, Petoskey led the [[Big Ten Conference]] with a .452 [[batting average]].

Petoskey played parts of the {{by|1934}} and {{by|1935}} Major League Baseball seasons as an [[outfielder]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and played [[minor league baseball]] until 1944.  Petoskey also served in a variety of collegiate coaching positions, including [[head coach]] of the [[University of South Carolina]]'s basketball team (1935&ndash;1940), athletic director and football coach at [[Wofford College]], and head baseball coach at the University of South Carolina (1940&ndash;42, 1948&ndash;56).

==High school athlete==
Petoskey was raised in St. Charles, Michigan and attended nearby Saginaw Eastern High School.<ref name=Rosters/>   On October 22, 1926, Petoskey became the first receiver in [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] history to garner five receiving [[touchdown]]s in a high school football game.<ref name=MHSAArec>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhsaa.com/games/records.pdf|format=PDF|title=MICHIGAN HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS RECORDS|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=Michigan High School Athletic Association|date=[[2002-08-01]]}}</ref>  As of August 2002, the record had not been surpassed.<ref name=MHSAArec/>  While playing for [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], Petoskey was an all-state [[End (American football)|end]] two years and an all-state [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] another.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report Bernard, Buss Will Enter U.of M.

==University of Michigan athlete==
Petoskey was a three-sport player for the [[Michigan Wolverines]].  While enrolled at Michigan, he earned eight [[varsity letter]]s -- three in football, three in [[baseball]] and two in [[basketball]].<ref name=Rosters>{{cite web|url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm|title=Bentley Historical Library -- -- U of M Football Rosters|accessdate=2007-12-11|date=[[2005-08-30]]|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aapetosk.htm|title=University of Michigan Football All-American: Ted Petoskey|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=[[2007-02-10]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bernard Gets 'M' Blanket|publisher=The News-Palladium|date=1934-06-02}}</ref>

===1931 and 1932 football seasons===
In Petoskey's three years as a varsity football player, the Wolverines had a combined record of 23&ndash;1&ndash;2 and won two national championships.  As a [[sophomore]] in 1931, Petoskey was touted as "a second [[Bennie Oosterbaan]],"<ref>{{cite news|title=16 Veterans On Michigan Gridiron Squad: Hewitt and Petoskey Lead Race for End|publisher=The Evening Tribune (Albert Lea, Minn.)|date-1931-09-11}}</ref> and earned a spot on the [[United Press]] All-[[Big Ten Conference]] second team.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kirksey, George|title=Kabat Named on United Press All-Conference Second team|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1931-11-24}}</ref>  

In his junior year, Petoskey was one of the favorite [[Forward pass|pass]] receivers for  [[quarterback]] [[Harry Newman]], who won the [[Douglas Fairbanks]] trophy as the [[Most Valuable Player]] in college football.  Coach [[Harry Kipke]] shifted Petoskey to [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] mid-way through the 1932 [[season (sports)|season]], and he scored two touchdowns in a 32&ndash;0 win over [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]].  The [[United Press]] noted: "A running attack which featured Ted Petoskey, converted from an end to a fullback in the last week by Coach Harry Kipke dovetailed nicely with the Wolverine aerial play to produce the touchdowns.  With Petoskey plunging the line and sweeping inside the ends for many sizeable gains, the Michigan eleven showed power through the line for the first time this season."<ref>{{cite news|author=UP wire service report|title=Illinois Is An Easy Prey For Michigan: Led by Petoskey Wolverines Romb to 32-0 Victory|publisher=Syracuse Herald|date=1932-10-23}}</ref>  An [[Associated Press]] writer warned opponents to watch out for Petoskey: "It is about time for grid foeman to wake up when Ted Petoskey, end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team, gets to dreaming.  Petoskey's dreams have a habit of coming true, and happily for Petoskey, most of his dreams are good ones."<ref name=Dreams/>

Petoskey was selected as a first-team All-American in 1932 by the All-American Football Board,<ref>{{cite news|title=All-American Team in Reel: Players Selected By Football Board Featured In Film|publisher=TheDaily Mail (Hagerstown, Md.)|date=1932-12-12}}</ref> a second-team All-American by the [[New York Sun]],<ref>{{cite news|title=New York Sun All-American|publisher=Times Evening Herald (Olean, N.Y.)|date=1932-11-26}}</ref> and a third-team All-American by the [[United Press]].<ref>{{cite news|author=McClure, Henry|title=Speed, Strength and Savvy Feature United Press' All-American 11|publisher=The Amarillo Globe|date=1932-11-28}}</ref>  After the [[1932 Michigan Wolverines football team|1932 team]] compiled a perfect 8&ndash;0 record (outscoring opponents 123&ndash;13) and won the national championship,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1932fbt.htm|title=1932 Football Team|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=[[2007-03-31]]}}</ref> the press credited the squad's "esprit de corps" as a key to their success.  As an example of Wolverine teamwork, a United Press story pointed to a fumble in the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] game.  "Michigan recovered, with both Ted Petoskey, end, and [[Chuck Bernard|Charles Bernard]], [[Center (American football)|center]], at the bottom of the heap.  Bernard credited Petoskey.  Petoskey said Bernard recovered."<ref>{{cite news|title=Teamwork of 1932 Wolverine Eleven Deserves Mention|publisher=The Piqua Daily Call|date=1933-01-03}}</ref>

===1933 football season===
[[Image:TedPetoskey.jpg|thumb|325px|right|Petoskey's "Flying Tackle Corrals The Ball" ([[Syracuse Herald]], March 1938)]]
During his senior year, Petoskey started all eight games at left end for the [[1933 Michigan Wolverines football team]], as Michigan won its second consecutive national championship, and Petoskey was again named an All-American.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1933fbt.htm|title=1933 Football Team|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=[[2007-03-31]]}}</ref>  Although Petoskey was principally an end, Coach Kipke played Petoskey at fullback in some games in 1933.  An October 1933 newspaper story reported on his versatility: "Ted Petoskey, Michigan's brilliant right end was moved into the backfield for last night's practice ...  This is the second time Petoskey has figured in such a shift.  Last fall he was converted into a fullback before the Illinois game and proved a capable ground gainer.  Monday he was given a trial as a [[forward pass]]er, and made an impressive showing."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ted Petoskey in Backfield for Michigan|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=The Evening Tribune (Albert Lea, Minn.)|date=[[1933-10-10]]}}</ref>  In his final game for the Michigan football team, Petoskey also kicked a 35-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] against [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]], representing the final points scored for Michigan in its 1933 championship season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Trounces Northwestern 13-0 For Big Ten Crown: Wolverines Undefeated and Have But Minnesota Tie Against Them|publisher=San Antonio Express|date=1933-11-26}}</ref>  

After the 1933 season, Petoskey was chosen as a first-team All-American in the Central Press poll of team captains,<ref>{{cite news|title=Football Captains Name Star Eleven of Gridiorn Season: Michigan Only Squad to Land Two Men on Team; South, East, Midwest Each Have 3|publisher=The Morning Herald (Uniontown, Pa.)|date=1933-12-08}}</ref> and for the second-team by [[Grantland Rice]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rice, Grantland|title=Rice Names Larson on First, Lund on Second All-American|publisher=The Brainerd Daily Dispatch (Minn.)|date=1933-12-22}}</ref>  Petoskey also finished third in the voting for the [[Associated Press]] 1933 Big Ten Athlete of the Year award.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mickelson, Paul|title=Purvis Draws Big 10 Award: Named Outstanding Athlete Beating Ward By Two Votes|publisher=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1933-12-31}}</ref>  In choosing Petoskey for his All-American team, football writer Lawrence Perry said: "Ted Petoskey of Michigan is one of the finest ends who ever played the game.  A former halfback, he is superb as an end-around runner.  He receives forward passes with great accuracy and when he catches the ball he is difficult to bring down."<ref>{{cite news|author=Perry, Lawrence|title=Five Coast Stars On Perry's All-America|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=1933-12-03}}</ref>

Coach Kipke credited the play of halfback, Herman Everhardus, and his ends for the undefeated season: "Our ends, Ward and Petoskey, were near perfection."<ref>{{cite news|author=Oliver, Merle|title=Coach Kipke Honors Team, Starts Tour: Wolverines Given Huge Welcome On Return To Ann Arbor Sunday|publisher=The News-Palladium|date=1933-11-27}}</ref>  The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook, called the ''Michiganensian'', described Petoskey's contributions as follows: "After three years of Varsity football, Petoskey is recognized as one of Michigan's greatest all-time ends.  At the end of his junior year, he was chosen All American, and recognized as one of the greatest defense players in the country.  He was alert, followed every play, and opponents found it almost impossible to gain around his end."<ref>1934 Michiganensian, p. 105.</ref>  In 1955, Kipke rated Petoskey as one of the six best players he ever coached: "If I had to name the best player I ever coached, it would have to be among [[Harry Newman]], [[Whitey Wistert|Francis Wistert]], [[Otto Pommerening]], [[Ted Petoskey]] and [[Maynard Morrison]]."<ref>{{cite news|author=Sainsbury, Ed (UP)|title=Harry Kipke Calls Harmon Greatest|publisher=The Holland, Michigan Evening Sentinel|date=1955-02-02}}</ref>

When the Associated Press picked Petoskey as only a second-team All-American in 1933,<ref>{{cite news|title=All Star 1933 Grid Team Selected by Associated Press; Michigan Has Four|publisher=The Daily Messenger, Canandaigua, N.Y.|date=1933-11-29}}</ref> ten-year-old Mary Lee Grossman from [[Saginaw, Michigan]] protested in a letter to AP sports editor, Alan Gould, that he had "chosen wrong" in leaving Petoskey and [[Whitey Wistert]] off the first-team.  To avoid any appearance of bias, the Saginaw native noted: "You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them.  I hope you change your mind."  Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's too late now to change our mind."<ref>{{cite news|author=Gould, Alan|title=Sport Slants|publisher=The Big Spring, Texas Daily Herald|date=1933-12-31}}</ref>

Gazette|date=1953-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Marvin Bass Joins USC Grid Staff|publisher=The Daily Independent (Kennopolis, N.C.)|date=1956-01-20}}</ref>  In twelve seasons as South Carolina's head baseball coach, Petoskey compiled a record of 113&ndash;120.  Petoskey's baseball players remembered his love of playing [[poker]] and his bringing the team home hungry after a tough loss to [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]].  In what team members remembered as the "hunger game," an angry Coach Petoskey told the players to "get on the bus," and the team rode from {{city-state|Durham|North Carolina}} to {{city-state|Columbia|South Carolina}} (236 miles) without having eaten.<ref name=CO>{{cite news|author=Spear, Bob|title=Names on Page Stir Treasured Memories; Former Bus Driver for USC Teams Reminisces About Players, Coaches|publisher=[[Charlotte Observer]]|date=2007-02-22}}</ref>
Another time against [[Furman University]], the Gamecocks blew an 11&ndash;2 lead in the 8th inning to lose 12&ndash;11.  On the bus, Petoskey had "that look," and the driver figured the team would receive a tongue-lashing.  "He said, 'I don't want to hear a word out of you guys, and that goes for you, too, Bussie.'"<ref name=CO/>
