The [[United States Air Force]]'s '''206th Combat Communications Squadron''' ('''206 CBCS''') was an [[Air National Guard]] combat communications unit located at [[Elmendorf AFB]], [[Alaska]]. 

==Mission==
The 206th Combat Communications Squadron<U+2019>s mission was to provide crucial information technology services worldwide. We provide full spectrum communications support and services using the latest technology to any customer: air, joint or coalition forces, as well as lend military support to civil authorities in times of crisis. The unit is a key asset in providing both Pacific Air Forces and the State of Alaska a communications team that can establish full
communications capabilities from any location and in any environment. We train to rigorous standards all the while promoting a strong team environment and fostering engaging career and educational opportunities.

==History==
The '''206th Combat Communications Squadron''' ('''206 CBCS''') can trace its distinguished history back to 1987 as the '''176th Combat Communications Flight''' located on [[Kulis Air National Guard Base]]. Under this designation, the unit was charged with the support of a Collocated Operating Base (COB) within the NATO theater. During this period, the unit participated in various CONUS-based exercises in preparation for execution of the European mission. 

In 1992, the military went through restructuring and due to the changing world situation the 206th Combat Communications Flight was formed to support the 11th Air Force during deployed wartime missions. The unit became a PACAF-gained combat communications unit effective 1 April 1993 and was relocated to Elmendorf Air Force Base. 

On 1 July 1996, the unit was re-designated as the 206th Combat Communications Squadron. Over time, the unit<U+2019>s primary mission evolved to support Pacific theater communications requirements. The principal means of this support was through the employment of two satellite communications

In December of 2001, shortly after the 9/11 tragedy, unit members volunteered to deploy to Southwest Asia to such places as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to participate in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM / SOUTHERN WATCH. While there, they endured many tense
moments and austere conditions while providing excellent communications support to combat actions.
