'''Typhoon Ida''' in [[1958 Pacific typhoon season|1958]] (international designation: '''''5822''''', also known as '''Super Typhoon Ida''' and the '''Kanogawa Typhoon''') was the third deadliest typhoon in Japan. On September&nbsp;20, Ida formed in the Western Pacific near Guam. It moved to the west and rapidly intensified into a 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) typhoon by the next day. On September&nbsp;22, Ida turned to the north and continued its quick rate of intensification. Two days later, the [[Hurricane Hunters]] observed a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|877|mb|inHg|abbr=on}}, as well as estimated peak winds of 340&nbsp;km/h (215&nbsp;mph). This made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone in the world at the time, although it was surpassed by Typhoon June 17&nbsp;years later. Ida weakened as it continued to the north-northeast, and made landfall in Japan on southeastern Honsh<U+016B> with winds of 80&nbsp;mph on September&nbsp;26. It became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] the next day, and dissipated on the 28th to the east of the country. Ida caused torrential flooding to southeastern Japan, resulting in over 1,900&nbsp;mudslides. Damage was estimated at $50&nbsp;million, and there were 1,269&nbsp;fatalities.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|Ida_1958_track.png}}
On September&nbsp;20, Tropical Storm Ida formed east of Guam. The storm moved westward, crossing the island as it gradually intensified into a typhoon.<ref name="jma">{{cite web|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=1989-06-01|title=RSMC Best Track Data - 1951-1959|accessdate=2011-11-25|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst5159.txt|format=TXT}}</ref> On September&nbsp;22, Ida began a motion to the north, following a path typical of September typhoons.<ref name="sept58"/> Around that time, the [[Hurricane Hunters]] reported that the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] was obscured, and over the subsequent 24&nbsp;hours the eyewall remained incomplete. However, over a 14-hour period beginning at 1500&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&nbsp;23, Typhoon Ida began undergoing [[rapid deepening]], at times a rate of {{convert|5.8|mbar|inHg|lk=on|abbr=on}} per hour. The eye became increasingly well-defined,<ref name="jou"/> and near 0500&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;24, a reconnaissance aircraft deployed a [[dropsonde]] in the typhoon about {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Guam. The instrument recorded a [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of {{convert|877|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}, which made Ida the strongest tropical cyclone on record at the time as measured by pressure.<ref name="low"/>

Around the time of its lowest pressure, the Hurricane Hunters estimated sustained winds in Ida of 345&nbsp;km/h (215&nbsp;mph).<ref name="low">{{cite journal|author=C. L.

Early on September&nbsp;27, Ida became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]], and its remnants moved through [[Sapporro]] and the [[Kuril Islands]] before dissipating late on September&nbsp;28.<ref name="jma"/>

When the Hurricane Hunters reported Ida's lowest pressure, the measurement was {{convert|10|mb|inHg|abbr=on}} lower than the previous record of {{convert|887|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}, set by a typhoon in 1927.<ref name="low"/> Ida retained its status as the most intense typhoon until 1973, when [[1973 Pacific typhoon season#Super Typhoon Nora (Luming)|Typhoon Nora]] attained the same minimum pressure.
