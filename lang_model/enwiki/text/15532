Oxford's coaches were G. C.

Cambridge were coached by [[R. C. Lehmann]] (former president of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] and captain of the [[Trinity College Boat Club|1st Trinity Boat Club]]; although he had rowed in the trials eights for Cambridge, he was never selected for the Blue boat).<ref>{{Cite book | title = A History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 3, 1750&ndash;1870 | first = Peter | last = Searby| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = 6 November 1997 | isbn = 978-0-52-135060-0 | page = 664 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VoMPRz8nYQEC&pg=PA664}}</ref><ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The umpire for the race for the fifth year in a row was [[Frank Willan (rower)|Frank Willan]] who won the event four consecutive times, rowing for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1866|1866]], [[The Boat Race 1867|1867]], [[The Boat Race 1868|1868]] and [[The Boat Race 1869|1869 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 59</ref>

According to author Wadham Peacock, [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] was undergoing repair which had jeopardised the running of the race.  It was also one of only a few occasions where the race was not held on a Saturday.<ref name=peacock114>Peacock, p. 114</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 3.125&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (77.4&nbsp;kg), {{convert|3.125|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge saw two rowers with Boat Race experience return, including Graham Campbell Kerr and Charles Thurstan Fogg-Elliot. Six of the Light Blues had matriculated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].  The Oxford boat contained five former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] including [[William Fletcher (rower)|William Fletcher]] who was participating in his fourth Boat Race.  Four of the Dark Blues were studying at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]].<ref name=burn65/> All of the competitors in the race were registered as British.<ref>Burnell, p. 38</ref>
  
Although Oxford had four members of the previous year's race available, Fletcher was injured in practice and [[Vivian Nickalls]] was unwell.  Cambridge's crew was considered to be powerful but technically deficient.<ref name=drink98>Drinkwater, p. 98</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]], along which the race is conducted]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn65>Burnell, p. 65</ref>  With a good spring tide and a light breeze from the east, umpire Willan started the race at 4:35&nbsp;p.m., with the Light Blues [[stroke rate|outrating]] their opponents at 40 strokes per minute,<ref>Peacock, p. 114</ref>  and taking an early lead.  Oxford drew level and moved ahead, holding a length's lead by the Mile Post.  With the advantage of the river's course to Cambridge, by [[Hammersmith Bridge]] the lead had been cut to half a length and at The Doves pub (almost {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} along the course), the crews were once again level. 

Along Chiswick, despite a higher stroke rate, Cambridge failed to move ahead and showed signs of tiredness, and Oxford began to move away again.  By [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] they were a length-and-a-half clear, but encountered difficult water there as a temporary dam that had been constructed created an eddy.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 98&ndash;99</ref> Cambridge took advantage to reduce the deficit and pushed all the way to the finishing post, but Oxford won by one-and-a-quarter lengths.  It was their fourth consecutive victory and in a time of 18 minutes 45 seconds, the fastest in the history of the event.<ref name=results/>
