The '''Laysan Albatross''', ''Phoebastria immutabilis'', is a large [[seabird]] that ranges across the [[North Pacific]]. This small (for its [[family (biology)|family]]) [[albatross]] is the second most common seabird in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], with an estimated population of 2.5 million birds, and is currently expanding (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new [[islands]]. It is named for [[Laysan]], one of its breeding colonies in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]].

==Description==
The Laysan Albatross is usually easy to identify, in the North Pacific it is simple to separate from the other relatively common albatross, the all black [[Black-footed Albatross]]. It can be distinguished from the very rare [[Short-tailed Albatross]] by its all dark back and smaller size. The Laysan Albatross' [[plumage]] has been compared to that of a [[gull]], two tone with a dark grey mantle and wings, and white underside and head.

==Behaviour and range==
The Laysan Albatross has a wide range across the North Pacific. Its main breeding colonies are in the  Hawaiian Islands, particularly the islands of [[Midway Atoll|Midway]] and [[Laysan]]. It also nests in the [[Bonin Islands]] near [[Japan]], and has recently began to colonize islands off [[Mexico]], such as [[Guadalupe Island]]. When away from the breeding areas they range widely from Japan to [[Alaska]] and down to [[California]], but usually far offshore. 

The Laysan Albatross is colonial, nesting on scattered small islands and [[atoll]]s, often in huge numbers. They also have a protracted breeding cycle. Juvenile birds return to the colony three years after [[fledge|fledging]], but will not mate for the first time until they are seven or eight years old. over these four or five years they form pair bonds with a mate that they will keep for life. Courtship entails especially elaborate 'dances' that have up to 25 ritualised movements.

Both birds incubate the single [[egg (biology)|egg]], with the male being the first to incubate the egg after laying. The [[Avian incubation|incubation]] takes about 65 days, after which the chick is brooded for a few days, after which both parents are out at [[sea]] to provision for the growing chick. The chick takes about 160 days to fledge, a long investment for the parents (which may explain the long courtship, both parents want to sure the other is serious). The chicks are fed a stomach oil by the parents.

==Conservation==
The Laysan Albatross, while a common [[species]], has not yet recovered from the wide-scale hunting that happened in the early [[1900s]], with [[feather]] [[hunter]]s killing many hundreds of thousands, and wiping them out from [[Wake Island]] and [[Johnston Atoll]]. This slaughter led to efforts to protect the species (and others) which led eventually to the protection of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The species is still vulnerable to [[long-line fisheries]], and the injestion of floating plastics. [[Feral cat]]s are known to prey nesting birds and chicks on some of the newer colonized islands.  In some places [[Big headed ants]] are a threat to young albatross chicks.

Lead poisoning is killing thousands of Laysan Albatross each year on Midway Atoll, part of the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument created by President George Bush in the summer of 2006.  The Laysan Albatross has been globally listed as vulnerable to extinction by the World Conservation Union, and is a special trust species on the Midway National Wildlife Refuge in the newly established National Monument.

<U+201C>Laysan chicks raised in nests close to 90 buildings left behind by the Navy are ingesting lead-based paint chips.  This is causing shockingly high lead concentrations in their blood, leading to severe neurological disorders, and eventual death,<U+201D> said George Fenwick, President of American Bird Conservancy.  <U+201C>Federal funds are urgently needed to cleanup this toxic mess to protect the Laysan Albatross as well as future visitors to the new Marine National Monument.<U+201D>

Scientific studies have shown that Laysan Albatross chicks are eating lead-based paint chips peeling off of 95 aging buildings on the island; and that as many as 10,000 chicks, or five percent of hatched chicks, may be killed annually by exposure to lead-based paint.  Many Laysan chicks that nest within five meters of building structures exhibit a condition referred to as "droopwing" which commonly manifests itself in the chicks<U+2019> inability to raise their wings, which drag on the ground resulting in broken bones and open sores.  Chicks with droopwing will never be able to fly, and will die of starvation or dehydration. Other chicks within close proximity to buildings also suffer detrimental effects from lead exposure.  These chicks have blood lead concentrations that cause immunological, neurological, and renal impairments, significantly decreasing their chances of survival.  

The Department of Interior (DOI) estimates that $5.6 million is needed to clean up the toxic lead paint on Midway Atoll.  The 95 federally owned government buildings must be stripped of all lead-based paint, and sand areas surrounding these old buildings need to be thoroughly sifted to remove lead paint chips.  When American Bird Conservancy staff presented the severity of this growing threat to an already-imperiled bird species to top Department of Interior officials, they were told that the new Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument did not have any federal funds or resources dedicated to its operation.  Moreover, the DOI officials stated that the current federal budget for the nation<U+2019>s wildlife refuge system would be insufficient to prevent the continued ingestion of lead paint by Laysan chicks.
