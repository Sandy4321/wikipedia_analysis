The history of the [[Oslo Tramway]] and [[Oslo Metro]] in [[Oslo]] (Kristiania until 1925), [[Norway]], starts in 1875, when [[Kristiania Sporveisselskab]] (KSS) opened two [[horsecar]] lines through the city centre. In 1894, [[Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei]] (KES) built the first electric street tramways, which ran west from the city centre. Within six years, all tramways were electric. The city council established [[Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie]] (KKS) in 1899, which built three lines before it was sold to KSS six years later. Both KSS and KES were taken over by the municipality in 1924, becoming [[Oslo Sporveier]]. The company gradually expanded the city tram network, which reached its peak length in 1939.

The [[Holmenkollen Line]] was the first [[light rail]] line, which opened in 1898 and ran west of the city. Later light rail lines in the west were the [[R<U+00F8>a Line]] (opened in 1912), the [[Lilleaker Line]] (1919), the [[Sognsvann Line]] (1934) and the [[Kols<U+00E5>s Line]] (1942). From 1928, they ran to the city centre via the [[Common Tunnel]]. East of the city, the [[Ekeberg Line]] opened in 1917, followed by the [[<U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line]] (opened in 1926) and the [[Lambertseter Line]] (1957). The light rail lines were built by three private companies, [[Holmenkolbanen]], [[Ekebergbanen (company)|Ekebergbanen]] and [[B<U+00E6>rumsbanen]]. By 1975, all had been bought by Oslo Sporveier.

The Oslo Metro opened in 1966, consisting of a line through the Common Tunnel to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget]] and the upgraded Lambertseter light rail line. The same year the [[Grorud Line]] opened. The next year the <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line was connected, and in 1970 the [[Furuset Line]] opened. The city council decided to close the tramways in 1960, and several lines were closed until the decision was revoked in 1977. In 1987, the Common Tunnel was completed. From 1993, the western lines were upgraded and connected to the Metro, allowing Metro trains to run through the city centre. The Metro's [[Ring Line (Oslo)|Ring Line]] was completed in 2006.

===Horsecars===
{{main|Kristiania Sporveisselskab}}
The first attempt to introduce horsecar operations in Oslo (at the time called Christiania) were in 1868, when the engineer [[Jens Theodor Pauldan Vogt]] and the architect [[Paul Due]] applied for a [[concession (contract)|concession]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab (A-40204)|url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/kss.asp|work=Oslo City Archive|accessdate=8 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The application was rejected because the city council felt that the streets were too narrow. They made a second application in April 1874, and this time permission was granted. On 26 August 1874, Vogt and Due established Christiania Sporveisselskab ("Christiania Tramway Company"). Twenty-two {{convert|4.1|m|adj=on}} long cars were delivered from the United States manufacturer [[John Stevenson Company|John Stephenson & Co]], arriving in Christiania on 31 August 1875. The official opening took place on 6 October 1875.<ref name=rotter>{{cite web |url=http://www.trikken.no/asp/Hoved.asp?SideID=4&Nivaa3Id=32&Prioritet=8&OmOssId=15 |title=Oslotrikkens r<U+00F8>tter g<U+00E5>r tilbake til 1875. |trans_title=The roots of the Oslo Tramway go back to 1875. |author=[[Oslo Sporvognsdrift]] |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQe9KemT}}</ref>{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=6}} In 1879, the city and company changed the spelling of the name "Christiania" to "Kristiania".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.snl.no/Kristiania |title=Kristiania |encyclopedia=[[Store Norske Leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |editor=Tvedt, Knut Are|accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |location=Oslo |year=2009}}</ref>

[[File:Trams at Anthenum 1904.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Trams at Athenum in 1904]]
The system initially had four [[standard gauge]], [[single track (rail)|single tracked]] lines, which had [[passing loop]]s to allow trams to pass. Three originated at [[Stortorget (station)|Stortorvet]]: the [[Gamlebyen Line]], running east to [[Gamlebyen]] (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the [[Vestbanen Line]], which ran west to [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon|Vestbanen station]] (Oslo West station); and the [[Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby Line]], which ran west to [[Homansbyen (station)|Homansbyen]], where [[Homansbyen Depot|the depot]] was located. In addition, there was a short connecting line between the Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The two lines<!-- which two? --> that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other two lines had fixed fifteen-minute [[headway]]<U+2014>decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use [[sled]]s instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=6}}

Profits were made immediately, and in 1877 an additional seven cars were delivered. The following year, a new line from Stortorvet to [[Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka]] was built<U+2014>the start of the [[Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka<U+2013>Torshov Line]]<U+2014>along with a new depot. The Gamlebyen Line was extended to [[St Halvards plass (station)|St Halvards plass]] on 2 December 1878, the Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka Line to Thorvald Meyers gate on 12 April 1879 and the Vestbanen Line to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879. The following year, the lines were merged to two through services: Homansbyen<U+2013>Oslo and Vestbanen<U+2013>Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka. After this, the company concentrated its investments into rebuilding the system to [[double track]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=6}} Between 1887 and 1892, the company took delivery of 14 additional cars from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]], the same length as the Stephenson cars. The last horsecar delivery was 15 cars from [[Falkenried]] in 1897, which were designed so they could be converted to electric tram [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]]. They were {{convert|6.6|m|ft}} long and remained in service until 1939.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=39}} In 1880, Kristiania Sporveisselskab registered a ridership of 1,499,000 passengers.{{Sfn|Fasting|1975|p=157}}

===Electrification===
{{main|Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei}}
The horsecar system was more expensive to operate than electric trams, and Christiania (later Kristiania) Elektriske Sporvei ("Kristiania Electric Tramway") was founded to establish an electric tram service. The initiative came from the [[engineer]]s [[H. E. Heyerdahl]], [[A. Fenger-Krog]] and [[Consul (representative)|consul]] [[L. Samson]].{{Sfn|Nilsen|1998|p=43}} KSS immediately attempted to buy the company, but the purchase failed. On 2 March 1894, the [[Briskeby Line]] opened, which ran westwards from the [[Oslo East Station|<U+00D8>stbanen station]] (Oslo East station) via the city centre and [[Briskeby (station)|Briskeby]] to [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen]],{{Sfn|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=17}} using a 600 volt supply.{{Sfn|Andersen|1992|p=13}} At the same time, a branch line opened from the Briskeby Line at [[Slottsparken (station)|Slottsparken]], heading further west to [[Skillebekk (station)|Skillebekk]].{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=25}} At first a shuttle service was provided on the branch line, but by April a through service was offered to <U+00D8>stbanen station. The branch line was extended to [[Nobels gate (station)|Nobels gate]] on 31 December 1894, to [[Thune (station)|Thune]] in 1901 and to [[Sk<U+00F8>yen (station)|Sk<U+00F8>yen station]] on 21 June 1903 and is now known as the [[Sk<U+00F8>yen Line]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=7}}
[[File:Tram at Egertorget in 1907.jpeg|thumb|Tram at Carl Johans Gate and Egertorget in 1907]]
The last street line built by KES was the [[Frogner Line]], which opened in 1902 from [[Solli plass (station)|Solli plass]] on the Sk<U+00F8>yen Line to [[Frogner plass (station)|Frogner plass]]. It was extended to Majorstuen, where the depot was located, on 15 May 1914. From 1909, KES introduced numbered services, with the Briskeby Line numbered 1, the Frogner Line numbered 2 and the Sk<U+00F8>yen Line numbered 3.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=7}} KES bought 78 motorized cars and 66 unmotorized trailers; of which 20 cars were later rebuilt to trailers. The main manufacturers were [[Herbrand]], Falkenried and Skabo, who delivering a continual stream of stock to the company until 1914. From then until 1925, there was sufficient rolling stock that only ten more vehicles were delivered.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=43}}{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=44}}

KSS decided to convert its lines to electric traction as well.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=7}} The first electric trams ran on 29 September 1899, and the conversion was completed by 15 January 1900.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=10}} At the time of electrification, KSS had 57 horsecars; 38 of these were later converted to trailers, while 19 were decommissioned. The John Stephenson and Skabo trailers were taken out of service in 1917<U+2013>18, and sixteen of these were sold to the [[Bergen Tramway]] and [[Trondheim Tramway]]<U+2014>the latter rebuilding them to [[meter gauge]]. One of the original Stephenson cars has been preserved at the [[Oslo Tramway Museum]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=39}}

The Vestbanen Line was extended west from Vestbanen station towards Skillebekk in two stages, on 21 December 1898 and again on 23 June 1899. The Gamlebyen Line was extended further east on 17 November 1899 to [[Oslo Hospital (station)|Oslo Hospital]]. The [[V<U+00E5>lerenga Line]], which ran east from the city centre, opened on 3 May 1900, and the [[Kampen Line]], which ran parallel but further north, on 6 June 1900. The first street line out of Kristiania into [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] was opened in three stages as an extension of the Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka<U+2013>Torshov Line: on 29 September 1899 to [[Torshov (station)|Torshov]], on 2 October 1901 to [[Sandaker (station)|Sandaker]] and, finally, to [[Grefsen Station]] on 28 November 1902.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=10}} For the electrification, KSS ordered 47 new trams from Falkenried and [[Waggonfabrik Linke-Hoffmann]]; these remained in service until 1967.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=45}} In 1900, the tramway had a ridership of almost 17 million passengers, or 75 trips per inhabitant.{{Sfn|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=17}}

===First municipal trams===
{{main|Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie}}
Since both tram companies were profitable, the city council decided to start another service<U+2014>Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie (KKS, "Kristiania Municipal Tramways")<U+2014>the first municipally owned tram operator in Norway. [[Sagene Ring]] was the first line, which opened on 24 November 1899 from [[Sagene]] to [[Akersgata]], where there was a connection onwards to <U+00D8>stbanen station using KES tracks. On 26 January 1901, a connection line was built from Tollbugaten to Kirkeristen in the city centre to avoid running on KES tracks.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}}

[[File:TRS 050515 008.jpg|thumb|Heritage tram no. 70 in Oslo Sporveier livery that was inherited from KSS.]]
A second KKS line was opened on 27 March 1900, from [[Nybrua]], located on the KSS's Gr<U+00FC>erl<U+00F8>kka<U+2013>Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodel<U+00F8>kka. Named the [[Rodel<U+00F8>kka Line]], the southern section would later become part of the [[Sinsen Line]]). From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodel<U+00F8>kka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at [[Vippetangen]]<U+2014>the [[Vippetangen Line]]. Again, KSS track was needed to connect the line into the city centre.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}} Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from [[Schuk]]<U+2014>stock that remained in service until 1967.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=45}} The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}}

===Consolidation===
After the take-over in 1905, KSS was operating seven routes: Homansbyen<U+2013>Oslo, Homansbyen<U+2013>Sannergata, Munkedamsveien<U+2013>Sannergata<U+2013>Grefsen, Munkedamsveien<U+2013>V<U+00E5>lerenga, Sagene <U+2013> St. Hanshaugen <U+2013> Kampen, St. Hanshaugen <U+2013> Rodel<U+00F8>kka and Stortorvet<U+2013>Vippetangen. KSS extended the Vippetangen Line <!-- to where? -->on 8 November 1905, and opened an extension from Homansbyen to Adamstuen on 24 September 1909. KSS and KES agreed to link their two networks, and a connecting line opened on 1 May 1912 between Homansbyen and [[Rosenborg (station)|Rosenborg station]] on KES's Line 1. An extension of the Vestbanen Line to Skillebekk was finished on 2 November 1911.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=11}}

[[File:Tram in Drammensveien 1919.jpeg|thumb|left|KES tram on the [[Sk<U+00F8>yen Line]] in 1919]]
This expansion caused the need for more rolling stock, and KSS took delivery of 42 trams from Falkenried and Skabo between 1912 and 1914. At {{convert|10.5|m}} long they were somewhat longer than the other trams.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=45}} The new lines allowed the two companies to operate on each others lines, and they introduced a common numbering scheme for the services. Several of the lines were serviced by two numbered routes, a system that remains in use today.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=11}} From 1912, a number of additional connections were built between the KES and KSS networks, and the two companies started cooperating on certain lines.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=7}} From 1921 to 1923, KSS bought an additional 22 trams from [[Hannoversche Waggonfabrik]], [[J. G. Brill and Company|Brill]] and Busch, commonly referred to as the [[OS HaWa|HaWa Class]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=45}} KSS had a annual ridership of almost 60 million in 1922.{{Sfn|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=57}}

==Light rail==
===Holmenkolbanen===
{{main|Holmenkolbanen}}
[[File:Nationaltheatret stasjon with tram.jpeg|thumb|Holmenkollen Line tram at [[Nationaltheatret (station)|Nationaltheatret]] in 1928]]

[[Holmenkolbanen]] ("The Holmenkollen Line") opened the city's first suburban [[light rail]] line, the [[Holmenkollen Line]], in 1898. It ran {{convert|6.5|km}} from [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen station]] northwestwards via 12 stations to [[Besserud (station)|Besserud station]]. Like all the later light rail lines, these were electric trams with a grade-separated right-of-way and proper stations instead of tram stops. Unlike the other suburban tram lines that were built later, the Holmenkollen Line was not extended into the city using on-street tracks. Instead, passengers had to change at Majorstuen station to KES streetcars. In 1909, the Holmenkollen Line started using {{convert|3.1|m|adj=on}} wide suburban stock, when it replaced its original [[HKB 1898 Class|1898 Class]] trams with [[HKB 1909 Class|1909 Class]] stock.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=8}}{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1995|p=38}} The {{convert|2.1|km|adj=on}} long [[R<U+00F8>a Line|Smestad Line]] opened in 1912 as a two station branch line from Majorstuen to [[Smestad (station)|Smestad station]] south of the Holmenkollen Line.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1995|p=38}}{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=12}} In 1916, the Holmenkollen Line was extended {{convert|5.2|km}} from Besserud northwards to [[Tryvann]] with six new stations. The last part, from [[Frognerseteren (station)|Frognerseteren station]] to Tryvann, which was single track and used for freight was demolished in 1939.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1995|p=38}}{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=14}}{{Sfn|Bjerke|Holom|1994|p=347}}

In 1912, Holmenkolbanen started construction of a {{convert|2.0|km|mi|sing=on}} long tunnel from Majorstuen station to [[Nationaltheatret (station)|Nationaltheatret station]], with an intermediate [[Valkyrie plass (station)|Valkyrie Plass station]]. This was the first part of the [[Common Tunnel]] and was blasted through the rock beneath the city. The extension was planned to give the two suburban lines access to the [[central business district]] of Oslo, but high construction costs and difficult geological conditions prevented the extension from opening until 1928. The tunneling caused the company financial difficulties, resulting in the Smestad Line being sold to [[Akersbanerne]], owned by Aker Municipality. In 1922, Holmenkolbanen started building the [[Sognsvann Line]], although it took twelve years to complete it. The {{convert|6.0|km|adj=on}} long line ran north from Majorstuen station to [[Sognsvann (station)|Sognsvann station]] with 11 new stations. The Smestad Line was extended {{convert|2.8|km}} to [[R<U+00F8>a (station)|R<U+00F8>a station]] in 1935 with six new stations and was renamed [[R<U+00F8>a Line]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=16<U+2013>7}}

===Ekeberg Line===
{{main|Ekeberg Line}}
The [[Ekebergbanen (company)|Ekebergbanen]] ("The Ekeberg Line") was incorporated in 1913, and the following year construction started on the single tracked [[Ekeberg Line]]. It opened on 11 June 1917, running {{convert|6.6|km}} southwards from [[Oslo Hospital (station)|Oslo Hospital station]] via six other stations to [[S<U+00E6>ter (station)|S<U+00E6>ter station]]. The company had made an agreement with KSS to use the Gamlebyen Line to Stortorvet, but chose to electrify the Ekeberg Line using 1,200 volts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/eb.asp |title=A/S Ekebergbanen |publisher=Oslo City Archive |accessdate=21 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=21 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQdwg3l4}}</ref> In 1924, Ekebergbanen started operating adjacent [[bus line]]s, the first in Oslo. On 30 September 1931, the {{convert|1.3|km|adj=on}}  long [[Simensbr<U+00E5>ten Line]] was opened with three stations as a branch from [[Jomfrubr<U+00E5>ten (station)|Jomfrubr<U+00E5>ten station]] to [[Simensbr<U+00E5>ten (station)|Simensbr<U+00E5>ten station]]. It was operated as a shuttle service outside rush hour; during peak hours a direct service was provided to Stortorvet.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=15}} Part of the main line was double-tracked from Sj<U+00F8>mannskolen station to Kastellet station in 1931, to Br<U+00E5>ten station in 1940 and to S<U+00E6>ter station in 1946.{{Sfn|Bjerke|Holom|1994|p=348}} The line was extended from S<U+00E6>ter to [[Ljabru (station)|Ljabru station]] on 17 September 1941, but the extension remained single track until 1967.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=15}}

===Lilleaker Line===
{{main|Lilleaker Line}}
[[File:Jar stasjon.jpeg|thumb|[[Jar (station)|Jar station]] on the [[Lilleaker Line]] in 1935]]

The success of the light rail lines tempted KES to extend the Sk<U+00F8>yen Line west from Sk<U+00F8>yen as a suburban line. The Lilleaker Line opened to [[Lilleaker (station)|Lilleaker station]] on 9 May 1919, to [[Avl<U+00F8>s (station)|Avl<U+00F8>s station]] in 1924 and to [[Kols<U+00E5>s (station)|Kols<U+00E5>s station]] in 1930. The section west of [[Jar (station)|Jar station]] is located in the municipality of [[B<U+00E6>rum]] in [[Akershus]]. A new branch section from Jar station to [[S<U+00F8>rbyhaugen (station)|S<U+00F8>rbyhaugen station]] opened in 1942, connecting the  Jar<U+2014>Kols<U+00E5>s Line to Nationaltheatret station. The Jar<U+2014>Kols<U+00E5>s Line was upgraded and the stock was replaced with wider suburban trams. Kols<U+00E5>s station is {{convert|16.7|km}} from Nationaltheatret station.{{Sfn|Bjerke|Holom|1994|p=346}}<ref name=historikk>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbane.no/index.aspx?cat=615223&id=745387&mid=745387 |title=Kort historikk |trans_title=Brief history |publisher=[[Oslo T-banedrift]] |accessdate=9 June 2008 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Akersbanerne===
{{main|Akersbanerne}}

Before its 1948 merger with the city of Oslo, [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] was a municipality which surrounded Oslo on all sides.<ref name=ossnl>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Aker |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |editor=Tvedt, Knut Are |url=http://www.snl.no/Aker |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |year=2009}}</ref> Akersbanerne ("The Aker Lines") was founded on 7 June 1917 by Aker Municipality to coordinate the construction of a new light rail line from Kristiania to new [[suburb]]s in Aker.<ref name=byarkivet>{{cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/ab.asp |publisher=Oslo City Archive |title=A/S Akersbanerne |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQeFjwo8}}</ref> The company planned to build several lines from the ends of the street tramways and extend them on grade-separated rights-of-way. Construction of the [[<U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line]] started in 1922 and opened from [[V<U+00E5>lerenga]] eastwards to [[Bryn, Oslo|Bryn]] on 18 December 1923, and to [[Oppsal (station)|Oppsal]] on 10 January 1926.<ref name=byarkivet /> For the first three years, street trams operated by KSS, and later Oslo Sporveier, ran the {{convert|1.5|km|adj=on}} route to Bryn. After the full line opened, spanning another {{convert|3.2|km}}, Akersbanerne could not reach agreement with Oslo Sporveier, owned by Oslo Municipality. It was not until 1937 that direct services to the city centre were provided via the V<U+00E5>lerenga Line.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=16<U+2013>7}}

==Second World War==
The tramways of Oslo experienced a higher ridership and several sabotage actions during the Second World War.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=94}} During the "April Days of 1940", rumor had it that Oslo was to be bombed, and the tram service was determined for half an hour that day.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=95}} Later, on 19 December 1943, an explosion at the ammunition supply at [[Filipstad]] caused full determination of tramways from 14.30.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=99}} A small explosition accident also took place at [[V<U+00E5>lerenga Depot]] in December 1944.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=100}} On 31 December 1944, a tram was hit by an airbomb at Drammensveien (now Henrik Ibsens gate) next to the [[Palace Park]], where all passengers but the conductor were killed.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=100}}

Due to a low supply of petrol, bus traffic was replaced by electric tramways.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=95}} The trams experienced therefore an increase in ridership, from 64 million passengers per year in 1939 to 151 billion in 1944.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=96}} The three lines of [[A/S Holmenkolbanen]] had together a ridership of 9.5 billion in 1939, 10.9 billions in 1940, 21 billions in 1943 and at the peak 22.6 billion passengers in 1945.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1995|p=30}} In addition to the regular tram passenger services, Oslo Sporveier started to transport goods across the city in tram wagons.{{Sfn|Fristad|1987|p=96}}

The leadership of the tramway was transferred to the German occupants, who printed tickets and signs with Nazi emblems on them.<ref>{{cite sign |title= 20 <U+00F8>re |language=Norwegian |distributor=AS Oslo Sporveier |location=Oslo |medium=Ticket}}</ref> If a passenger "demonstrated" by changing his seat when seated next to a German officer, he was expelled at the next station.{{Sfn|Nilsen|1998|p=124}}

The city had granted concessions to the two private street car companies until 1924, after which the city could [[expropriate]] the companies. Both companies were well run and highly profitable, and on 1 May 1924, KSS and KES were merged and taken over by the city council, which gave the new company the name Kristiania Sporveier ("Kristiania Tramways"). The municipality owned 51 per cent.<ref name=ossnl>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Oslo Sporveier AS |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |editor=[[Aspenberg, Nils Carl]] |url=http://www.snl.no/Oslo_Sporveier_AS |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |year=2009}}</ref> On 1 January 1925, the city changed its name to Oslo, with the company's name also changing. The light rail lines operated by Holmenkolbanen and Ekebergbanen were not taken over, nor was the Lilleaker Line operated by KES; the city council did not want to take over tram lines in Aker. The Lilleaker Line operations of KES were transferred to the private company [[B<U+00E6>rumsbanen]] ("The B<U+00E6>rum Line").{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}}<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://ruter.no/Miljo-og-kultur/Tidslinje/ |title=Tidslinje |trans_title=Timeline |publisher=[[Ruter]] |accessdate=19 August 2008 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621175208/http://www.ruter.no/Miljo-og-kultur/Tidslinje/  |archivedate = 21 June 2008}}</ref>

After the take-over, Oslo Sporveier immediately started expanding the tram network.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} On 4 May 1924, the [[Korsvoll Line]] was opened as a branch of the Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka<U+2013>Torshov Line from Torshov northwestwards to [[Bj<U+00F8>lsen]]. On 1 August 1925, the Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby Line Line was extended from Adamstuen further north to [[Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby]]. The [[Kjels<U+00E5>s Line]] opened on 25 September 1934 and ran from [[Storo (station)|Storo]] on the Gr<U+00FC>nerl<U+00F8>kka<U+2013>Torshov Line northwards to [[Kjels<U+00E5>s (station)|Kjels<U+00E5>s station]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}} By 1934, the municipality had gained full ownership of Oslo Sporveier.<ref name=ossnl /> The new company also decided to increase the permitted car width to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}, allowing wider suburban trams to run in the city streets. During the 1930s, Oslo Sporveier decided it needed more rolling stock, and cooperated with [[Str<U+00F8>mmens V<U+00E6>rksted]] to create the [[Gullfisk]] ("Goldfish") class. Forty-six units were delivered from 1937 to 1940. Built with an aluminum chassis, they were quick and light, with a distinct [[streamliner|streamlined]] shape, making their back ends look like a goldfish tail.<ref name=trikk4647>Aspenberg, 1994: 48<U+2013>49</ref> On 1939, the Sinsen Line was extended from [[Carl Berners plass (station)|Carl Berners plass]] northwards to [[Sinsen (station)|Sinsen]]. At this point the city had its most extensive tram network.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=9}}

Holmenkolbanen had built-up large debts in building the underground section to Nationaltheatret, including large amounts of compensation to house-owners who had their buildings damaged during construction. To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=16<U+2013>7}} From 4 January 1937, B<U+00E6>rumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=16<U+2013>7}} Oslo Sporveier started operating [[Oslo trolleybus|trolleybus]] lines from 1939.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=21}} On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought B<U+00E6>rumsbanen and took over the operation of the Lillaker and <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/bb.asp |title=A/S B<U+00E6>rumsbanen |publisher=Oslo City Archive |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQeJC0PG}}</ref> On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged,{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=16<U+2013>7}} and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally owned companies Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier.<ref name=byarkivet /> The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} In 1975, Oslo Sporveier bought all but a few of the shares in Holmenkolbanen, and at the same time took over operation of all the suburban lines.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=15}}

===Partial closing===
[[File:Oslo tram holtet.jpg|thumb|In 1960, the city council decided to close the whole tramway, including the [[Ekeberg Line]]]]
The Oslo Tramway had a ridership of 108 million passengers in 1948.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} On 17 January 1949, the Korsvoll Line became the first tram line to be closed.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} followed by the Rodel<U+00F8>kka Line on 6 February.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} The latter reopened following a new route on 2 January 1955.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=24}} In 1960, with the deregulation of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks. Tracks would be kept and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would be made in the lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodel<U+00F8>kka, Vippetangen, Simensbr<U+00E5>ten and Vestbanen Lines were closed,{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=5}} as were trolleybus lines 18 and 24. The remaining two trolleybus routes were closed in 1968.{{Sfn|Thuesen|Waage|Lorentzen|2007|p=123}} On 24 June 1968, [[V<U+00E5>lerenga Line]] was closed.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=22}}

However, no further tram lines were closed. In 1969, the site of the turning loop at Sinsen needed to be moved to allow the construction of the [[Sinsen Interchange]]. Instead of closing the line, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a new loop at Muselunden at Sinsen. The Ekeberg Line was scheduled to close in 1972, because a new line needed to be built to allow passage during the construction of [[Oslo Central Station]], which would replace the <U+00D8>stbanen. After heavy protests from Ekeberg residents, Oslo Sporveier chose to built a loop in Vognmannsgata in the city centre.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=31}}

==Metro==
{{main|Oslo Metro}}
[[File:Mortensrud stasjon 18jun2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[T1000 train|T1000]]s stock at [[Mortensrud (station)|Mortensrud]] on the <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line.]]

The city established the Metro Office on 15 September 1949, with the first plans launched in 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/sporveiene/tunnelbanekontoret.asp |title=Tunnelbanekontoret |trans_title=The subway office |publisher=Oslo City Archive |accessdate=2008-08-18 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=22 November 2010 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQeLU8Qw}}</ref> In 1954, the city council decided to build the metro network with four branches in eastern Oslo; two would run on each side of the [[Grorud Valley]], while two would run southwards through [[Nordstrand]]. These areas had all been chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and needed a good public transport system to be put in place quickly. The system was to feature improvements over the light rail lines: a [[third rail]] power supply, [[cab signaling]] with [[automatic train protection]], stations long enough for six-car trains and [[level crossing]]s replaced by bridges and underpasses<U+2014>specifications christened "metro standard" by Oslo Sporveier.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=29}}

The <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line would be converted to metro standard, and three new lines would be built. The [[Lambertseter Line]] opened as a light rail line from [[Brynseng (station)|Brynseng station]], where it connected to the V<U+00E5>lerenga Line, to [[Bergkrystallen (station)|Bergkrystallen station]] on 28 April 1957. Originally it had [[overhead wire]]s, low platforms and was served using trams. The Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway. The Lambertseter Line served the area located between the Ekeberg and <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Lines. The <U+00D8>stensj<U+00F8> Line was extended to [[B<U+00F8>ler (station)|B<U+00F8>ler station]] in 1958.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=29}}

[[File:Oslo Metro diagram 2010.svg|thumb|Schematic of the [[Oslo Metro]] as of 2010. Six of the branches were originally built as light rails lines.]]
The Metro took delivery of [[OS T1000|T1000]] trains from Str<U+00F8>mmens Verksted. From 1964 to 1978, 162 cars were delivered for the eastern network. The metro opened on 22 May 1966, when the Common Tunnel opened from Brynseng station to [[Jernbanetorget (station)|Jernbanetorget station]] in the city centre, located beside the <U+00D8>stbanen. The same day, the Lambertseter Line was reopened after it had been upgraded to metro standard. On 16 October 1966, the then {{convert|9.2|km|adj=on}} and twelve station long [[Grorud Line]], which ran northeast on the northern hillside of the Grorud Valley, opened to [[Grorud (station)|Grorud station]]. The Lambertseter Line was connected to the system in 1967, when the line was extended to [[Skullerud (station)|Skullerud station]].{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=62<U+2013>3}}

The [[Furuset Line]] runs on the southern hillside of the Grorud Valley. It opened to [[Haugerud (station)|Haugerud station]] in 1970, and was extended to [[Trosterud (station)|Trosterud station]] in 1974. The same year, the Grorud Line was extended to [[Vestli (station)|Vestli station]], which is {{convert|14.6|km}} from Jernbanetorget. By 1981, the Furuset Line had reached [[Ellingsrud<U+00E5>sen (station)|Ellingsrud<U+00E5>sen station]], which is {{convert|11.5|km}} from Jernbanetorget.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=29<U+2013>30}} The western light rail lines took delivery of 33 [[OS T1000|T1300]] train cars from 1978 to 1981, with an additional 16 converted from the existing T1000 cars. The T1300 cars differed in that they could run on both third rail and overhead wires. Although not connected to the metro, the western lines were gradually becoming more like the metro, although they retained overhead wires, a different signaling system and shorter platforms.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=62<U+2013>3}} 

===Common Tunnel===
{{main|Common Tunnel}}
The western lines terminated at an underground station on the west side of the city centre, while the metro terminated at an underground station at the east side of the city centre. The two termini were located {{convert|1.2|km}} apart. [[Stortinget (station)|Sentrum station]], located in the heart of the city centre, {{convert|0.5|km}} east of Jernbanetorget, opened along with the extension of the metro tunnel in 1977. Water leaks exceeding the drainage capacity forced the station to be closed between 1983 and 1987. When it reopened, the western light rail tunnel had been extended to it, and the station was renamed Stortinget. Because of incompatible signalling and power equipment, it was not possible for trains to run through the whole tunnel. In 1993, the western part of the Common Tunnel and the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, followed by the R<U+00F8>a Line two years later. Trains on the Holmenkollen and Kols<U+00E5>s Line needed both [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]]s and [[third rail shoe]]s to operate, using the former on the outer parts of the line and the latter in the tunnel. They switched to overhead wire at [[Fr<U+00F8>en (station)|Fr<U+00F8>en station]] and [[Montebello (station)|Montebello station]], respectively.<ref name=milepaler>{{cite web |url=http://www.sporveien.no/Kultur-og-historie-/153/ |title=Milep<U+00E6>ler 1875<U+2013>2005 |trans_title=Milestones 1875-2005 |publisher=[[Oslo Sporveier]] |accessdate=9 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429042349/http://www.sporveien.no/Kultur-og-historie-/153/  |archivedate = 20 April 2008}}</ref>{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=30}} In 1994, six two-car [[OS T2000|T2000]] trains were delivered for the Holmenkollen Line to meet the need for more rolling stock.

In 2003, the section of the Kols<U+00E5>s Line in [[B<U+00E6>rum]] closed due to disagreements between the two counties of Oslo and [[Akershus County Municipality|Akershus]] on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on the two sides of the municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tbane.no/index.aspx?cat=617538&id=917829 |title=Kols<U+00E5>sbanen i mai |trans_title=The Kols<U+00E5>s Line in May |publisher=Oslo T-banedrift |accessdate=21 November 2010 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> By 2010, the upgraded part had reached [[Bj<U+00F8>rnsletta (station)|Bj<U+00F8>rnsletta station]] in Oslo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/banen-nermer-seg-berum-1.5542829 |title=Banen n<U+00E6>rmer seg B<U+00E6>rum |trans_title=The line approaches B<U+00E6>rum |work=[[Budstikka]] |publisher=www.budstikka.no |first=Jens |last=Svenningsen |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2010 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tavMt5yU |archivedate=19 October 2010}}</ref> In 2003, the [[Ring Line (Oslo)|Ring Line]] opened from [[Ullev<U+00E5>l stadion (station)|Ullev<U+00E5>l Stadion station]] on the Sognsvann Line to [[Storo (station)|Storo station]].

==Revival of the tramway==
[[File:SporvognS83.jpg|thumb|The [[SL79]] trams were ordered in 1979 after the decision to keep the tramway, here at [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen]].]]

In 1977, the city council changed their decision to close down the tramway.{{Sfn|Hartmann|Mangset|2001|p=108}} The main reason was the [[1973 oil crisis]], which had made it cheaper to run [[hydroelectric]]-powered trams than diesel-powered buses.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=34}} After no investment on the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used [[GS M-23|M-23]] units from the [[Gothenburg tram|Gothenburg Tramway]] in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five [[SL79]] [[articulated tram]]s were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=51<U+2013>2}} Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.{{Sfn|Aspenberg|1994|p=15}}

During the 1990s, a number of expansions were made to the tram network. The disused line from Storo via the depot at Grefsen to Sinsen opened for revenue traffic in 1993. In 1995, the [[Vika Line]] was constructed to access [[Aker Brygge]], a new waterfront neighbourhood is the southwestern part of the city centre, and in 1999, the Ullev<U+00E5>l Hageby Line was extended to the new [[Rikshospitalet (station)|Rikshospitalet]]. For these new lines, 32 [[SL95]] [[low-floor tram]]s  were delivered from 1996 to 2004, replacing all but the SL79 units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ruter.no/Reiseinformasjon/Din-sikkerhet/Sikkerhet-pa-trikken/Leddtrikk-SL-95/ |title=Leddtrikk SL 95 |publisher=[[Ruter]] |accessdate=22 November 2010 |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQYQD8LW |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The voltage was increased from 600 to 750&nbsp;volts on 4 June 2000, once all non-articulated trams had been retired.{{Sfn|Bjerke|Holom|1994|p=348}}

[[File:Oslotrikk 3.JPG|thumb|left|The [[SL95]] [[low-floor tram]]s were introduced in 2000]]
In 2002, Oslo Sporveier announced that it would close the Ekeberg, Sinsen, Briskeby and Kjels<U+00E5>s Lines to reduce costs. Only the Kjels<U+00E5>s Line was actually closed and replaced by buses, which occurred 21 November 2002. After local protests, and a compromise in the city council, the Kjels<U+00E5>s Line was reopened on 22 November 2004.<ref>

On 1 July 2003, Oslo Sporveier was reorganized with the operation of the trams transferred to [[Oslo Sporvognsdrift]] ("Oslo Tram Operations") and the operation of the Metro to [[Oslo T-banedrift]] ("Oslo Metro Operations"). Another reorganization was made on 1 July 2006, when Oslo Sporveier was demerged into two companies. The [[Oslo Public Transport Administration]], which kept the Oslo Sporveier brand name, was made responsible for purchasing and the marketing of the public transport system. The ownership and maintenance of the tracks and stations was transferred to [[Kollektivtransportproduksjon]] ("Public Transport Production"). The latter also became the parent of the operating companies, who retained the actual running of the trams and metro trains. The brand name Oslo Sporveier was discontinued on 1 January 2008, when [[Ruter]] was created as a merger between the Oslo Public Transport Administration and [[Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk]] ("Greater Oslo Local Traffic")<U+2014>which had been responsible for public transport in [[Akershus]].<ref name=timeline />

==Preservation==
{{main|Oslo Tramway Museum}}
In 1966, the Oslo Tramway Museum was founded to preserve the tramway and trolleybus vehicles. The museum is run by a 450-member non-profit organization Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening (LTF, "Local Traffic History Association").<ref name=omltf>{{cite news |url=http://www.sporveismuseet.no/ltf/ltf.html |title=Om LTF |trans_title=About LTF |work=[[Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening]] |publisher=www.sporveismuseet.no |date=29 August 2000 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> It was founded as a reaction to the aftermath of the closing of the Bergen Tramway, where only a single tram was preserved, and where volunteers realized that a similar lack of preservation could happen in Oslo. As of 2004, the museum had 56 rail vehicles, 31 buses and seven other vehicles, including four [[trolleybus]]es.<ref name=vognparken>{{cite news |url=http://sporveismuseet.no/ltf/vognparken.html |title=Vognparken |trans_title=the wagon fleet |work=[[Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening]] |publisher=www.sporveismuseet.no |date=20 March 2004 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> It has a museum with 25 trams and 10 buses on display at Majorstuen,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sporveismuseet.no/museum/vh5_informasjon.html |title=Informasjon on museet |trans_title=Information on the museum |work=[[Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening]] |publisher=www.sporveismuseet.no |date=7 November 1999 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> as well as a full heritage tramway, including [[Slemdal (station)|Slemdal station]], which is under construction at [[Vinterbro]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sporveismuseet.no/museum/ves.html |title=Museumssporveien Vinterbro |trans_title=Museum Tramway Vinterbro |work=[[Lokaltrafikkhistorisk Forening]] |publisher=www.sporveismusset.no |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ujbPBTcv |archivedate=4 December 2010}}</ref>

==Future plans==
{{main|Oslo Package 3}}
[[File:MX3000.jpg|thumb|Delivery of the [[MX3000]] stock started in 2006.]]

[[Oslo Package 3]] is a political agreement between all the major projects on what to spend public funding for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), which will be shared between investments in road infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, and operating subsidies for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from [[toll road]]s. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period. In addition, the previous agreement, [[Oslo Package 2]], still has funding for some smaller projects.<ref name=oslopakke3>{{cite news |url=http://www.akershus.no/file.php?id=4761 |work=[[Akershus County Municipality]] |publisher=www.akershus.no |title=Oslopakke 3 |trans_title=Oslo Package 3 |date=29 May 2006 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=22 November 2010 |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQYkEd85}}</ref>

An upgrade of the Kols<U+00E5>s Line to metro standard started in 2006,<ref name=asjordet>{{cite news |url=http://ruter.no/Presse/Pressemelding/Husebybakken-stasjon-nedlegges/ |title=Husebybakken stasjon nedlegges |trans_title=Husebybakken Station will be closed |work=[[Ruter]] |publisher=ruter.no |accessdate=13 August 2008 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801084354/http://ruter.no/Presse/Pressemelding/Husebybakken-stasjon-nedlegges/ |archivedate = 11 August 2008}}</ref> and is estimated to finish by 2014.<ref name=blaa>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2979548.ece|title=Kols<U+00E5>sbanen i det bl<U+00E5>|trans_title=Kols<U+00E5>s Line in the blue|work=[[Aftenposten]]|publisher=www.aftenposten.no|first=Hegtun|last=Halvor|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=16 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the Common Tunnel, a new [[Homansbyen (station)|Homansbyen Station]] is planned between Majorstuen and Nationaltheatret. The Grorud Line is planned be connected to the Ring Line via the [[L<U+00F8>ren Line]], allowing trains to run directly from Grorud to the Ring via a station at [[L<U+00F8>ren]].  An extension has been proposed for the Furuset Line to [[L<U+00F8>renskog]], which would give stations at [[Visperud]], L<U+00F8>renskog Centre and a new terminus at [[Akershus University Hospital]] (Ahus). The travel time from Ahus to Jernbanetorget would be 27 minutes.<ref name=oslopakke3 />

The [[Fjord City]] [[urban redevelopment]] project that is converting the [[Bj<U+00F8>rvika]] and [[Vippetangen]] areas in the centre of Oslo, will include a gradual building of tramways through them. The Ekeberg Line will be moved to run on the south side of the Central Station through Bj<U+00F8>rvika. A new line may also be built from Aker Brygge around Vippetangen to Bj<U+00F8>rvika.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.prosjekt-fjordbyen.oslo.kommune.no/getfile.php/fjordbykontoret%20%28FJORDBYEN%29/Internett%20%28FJORDBYEN%29/Dokumenter/rapport/Tilgjengelighet%20og%20transport%20i%20Fjordbyen.pdf |title=Tilgjengelighet i Fjordbyen: Del 3 Prinsipper for transportsystemet |trans_title=Accessability in the Fjord City: Part 3 - The foundamentals for the transportation system |journal=Oslo Waterfront Planning Office |publisher=www.prosjekt-fjordbyen.oslo.kommune.no |date=16 November 2006 |page=87 |accessdate=22 November 2010 |archivedate=22 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQYtaV1y}}</ref> A similar redevelopment project at [[Fornebu]] in B<U+00E6>rum involves plans for building the [[Fornebu Line]] as an extension of the [[Lilleaker Line]] from [[Furulund (station)|Furulund]] via [[Lysaker Station]] to Fornebu. The line was previously planned as a [[people mover]], but the solution was unsuccessful, and planning now focuses on building a tramway instead. An extension of the Sinsen Line to [[Tonsenhagen]] is planned.<ref name=oslopakke3 />
