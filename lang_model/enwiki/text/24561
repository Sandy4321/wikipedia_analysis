'''Belinda Bencic''' ({{lang-sk|Belinda Ben<U+010D>i<U+010D>ov<U+00E1>}}; born 10 March 1997 in [[Flawil]]) is a Swiss [[tennis]] player.

Bencic, whose father emigrated to Switzerland from [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968,<ref name="Zeit"/> won the [[2013 French Open <U+2013> Girls' Singles]] and [[2013 Wimbledon Championships <U+2013> Girls' Singles]] titles. She had previously played two rubbers for [[Switzerland Fed Cup team|Switzerland]] in the [[2012 Fed Cup]].<ref name="Zeit">{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2012/23/CH-Tennis/komplettansicht|title=Das Risikokapital|first=Dennis|last=B<U+00FC>hler|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012|language=German}}</ref>

Bencic has won two singles and two doubles titles on the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tour. On 9 December 2013, she reached her best singles ranking of world number 183. On 25 November 2013, she peaked at world number 401 in the doubles rankings.

== Career ==
=== 2012 ===
Bencic kicked off her 2012 season by winning two back-to-back G18 ITF tournaments in the Czech Republic, dropping not a single set in the former and only one in the latter. She then qualified for and reached the quarterfinals of a professional $10,000 ITF event in [[Leimen (Baden)|Leimen]], Germany, losing to eventual finalist [[Tereza Smitkov<U+00E1>]]. Two months later, in April, she headed to the United States for a G18 ITF in California, where she lost in the third round to [[Allie Kiick]]. The following week, Bencic played a $25,000 ITF tournament in [[Pelham, Alabama]], losing to the former [[1999 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] semifinalist [[Alexandra Stevenson]] during qualifying. Then, she returned to the junior tour playing a G18 G1 tournament in [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer]], France. Seeded seventh, she breezed through all her matches, losing only one set in the second round. The following week, Bencic won her fourth title of the year at a G18 G2 in Italy, once again dropping one set. However, her amazing run was ended the following week in the semifinals of another G2 in Italy.

Later in May, Bencic received a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the WTA [[2012 Brussels Open (tennis)|Brussels Open]]. In the first round of qualifying, she stunned the tennis world by knocking out former top-20 player [[Elena Bovina]] in three sets. She was eliminated in the second round of qualifying by [[Lesia Tsurenko]], but her win over Bovina boosted her ranking up 189 places to a career high of world number 951.

Bencic's next tournament was the junior [[2012 French Open|French Open]] in Paris. As the fifteenth seed, she was stunned in the first round by unseeded Fran<U+00E7>oise Abanda in two tie breaks. Less than a month after her disappointing loss at the French Open, she headed to [['s-Hertogenbosch]] for another WTA tournament, the [[2012 UNICEF Open <U+2013> Women's Singles|UNICEF Open]]. However, she was defeated by top qualifying seed [[Urszula Radwa<U+0144>ska]].

The following week, Bencic played her [[2012 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] warm-up tournament, the G18 G1 Aegon International in [[Roehampton]]. She reached the semifinals, defeating top junior players such as [[Indy de Vroome]] and Sachia Vickery, before being defeated by future Wimbledon girl's champion [[Eugenie Bouchard]] of Canada. At Wimbledon, she again suffered a disappointing early stage singles loss to Indy de Vroome in round two, but reached the final in doubles.

A few weeks later, Bencic headed home to Switzerland to play the prestigious G18 G1 European Junior Championships. Seeded second and the home favourite, she made it to the semifinals, losing to [[Ba<U+015F>ak Erayd<U+0131>n]]. A month later, she travelled to Canada for another G1 tournament, the Canadian Open Junior Championships, a warm-up for the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. She reached the third round, losing to [[Je<U+013C>ena Ostapenko]], despite taking the first set to love. At the US Open, Bencic once again failed to make an impression at a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]], losing in the second round to wildcard and eventual champion [[Samantha Crawford]] in three tough sets. However, she had better results in doubles, reaching the final alongside Petra Uberalov<U+00E1>, before losing to home favourites [[Gabrielle Andrews]] and [[Taylor Townsend (tennis)|Taylor Townsend]].

After the US Open, Bencic took a two-week break before returning to the pro circuit at a $10,000 ITF event in [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], Egypt. In the first round, she crushed the top seed of China, Lu Jiajing. In the next two rounds, she breezed past two qualifiers to advance to her first professional semifinal, where she defeated fourth seed [[Barbara Haas]] of Austria to advance to the final. She claimed her first professional title by defeating second seed [[Fatma Al Nabhani]]. She also won the doubles tournament in Egypt partnering Lou Brouleau. The following week, Bencic continued her amazing run on the pro circuit by winning another $10,000 ITF tournament in Sharm el-Sheikh, defeating Haas again, but this time in the final. She lost only one set in the whole tournament, and her ashtonishing performance in Egypt boosted her ranking 170 places to world number 722, a career high.

Bencic was then granted a wildcard into the main draw of the [[2012 BGL Luxembourg Open|BGL Luxembourg Open]], where she faced former world number one [[Venus Williams]] in the first round, losing in straight sets.<ref name="2012-Lux">{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/sport/tennis/Bencic-unterliegt-der-grossen-Venus-Williams-/story/16392946|title=Bencic unterliegt der grossen Venus Williams|work=[[Tages-Anzeiger]]|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=10 July 2013|language=German}}</ref> Williams went on to win the tournament. This WTA main draw debut once again raised her ranking significantly, 108 places to world number 614.

Bencic then progressed through qualifying to take a place in the main draw at the $25,000 ITF tournament in [[Benicarl<U+00F3>]], Spain, where she lost in the first round to [[Dinah Pfizenmaier]]. After this, she completed her 2012 season with a stellar display of junior tennis in North America, reaching the semifinals of Eddie Herr, a Grade 1 event in Florida, reaching the quarterfinals of the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl]], and winning the Grade A Abierto Juvenil in Mexico, with a record six to-love sets throughout the tournament. These included two "double bagels".

=== 2013 ===
Bencic played the first ten tournaments of her 2013 campaign in the United States. All but one were ITF $25,000 or $50,000 events, the exception being the [[2013 Sony Open Tennis|2013 Sony Open]], where she lost in qualifying under a wildcard entry. Her best result was a quarterfinal appearance in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], but her big break came at the [[2013 Audi Melbourne Pro Tennis Classic]] during the final week of April; she qualified for the tournament with the loss of just one set, before upsetting top seed [[Tatjana Maria]] with a surprisingly one-sided first-round win. She proceeded to the semifinals with three-set wins over Americans [[Shelby Rogers]] and [[Jan Abaza]], but was then defeated by eventual champion [[Petra Rampre]]. This performance boosted her ranking 81 places to world number 351.

Next, Bencic flew to Europe for her junior [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] campaigns. Her first tournament was a Grade 1 tournament in Italy, a warm-up for the French Open. Playing her first junior tournament of the year, she breezed to the singles title as the top seed with the loss of only one set and reached the semifinals in doubles alongside [[Viktoriya Lushkova]]. The following week, she played a Grade A tournament, also in Italy, and showed no signs of deteriorating form when she snatched the title with the loss of just one set, boosting her junior ranking to a career high of world number 2.

Bencic was seeded second at the French Open. In the first two rounds, she defeated [[Alice Matteucci]] and [[Fiona Ferro]] without losing a set, but was pushed to three-set matches by [[Beatriz Haddad Maia]], [[Taylor Townsend (tennis)|Taylor Townsend]] and [[Louisa Chirico]] en route to her first Grand Slam singles final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/urnnewsmlwwwsda-atsch20130607brz007-1.18095079|title=Juniorin Bencic im Final|work=[[Neue Z<U+00FC>rcher Zeitung]]|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|language=German}}</ref> The final was a one-sided affair, as she defeated [[Antonia Lottner]] from Germany in straight sets in a little over an hour to win her maiden Grand Slam and become the first Swiss girl since [[Martina Hingis]] in [[1994 French Open|1994]] to be victorious at Roland Garros's junior tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sport/tennis/grand-slam-turniere/bencic-gewinnt-juniorinnen-turnier-der-french-open|title=Bencic gewinnt Juniorinnen-Turnier der French Open|work=[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]]|date=8 June 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|language=German}}</ref>

Prior to Wimbledon, Bencic played a senior ITF $25,000 event in [[Lenzerheide]], Switzerland (where she was singles semifinalist and doubles champion, alongside [[Kate<U+0159>ina Siniakov<U+00E1>]]) and a junior Grade 1 at [[Roehampton]] (which she won in singles). She then went on to capture the Wimbledon title, defeating Townsend in the final, to crown a successful summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/bencic-wie-einst-hingis-1.18112227|title=Bencic wie einst Hingis|work=[[Neue Z<U+00FC>rcher Zeitung]]|date=6 July 2013|accessdate=10 July 2013|language=German}}</ref>

Bencic next appeared in competition at the [[2013 Swedish Open]] on the [[2013 WTA Tour|WTA Tour]], where she was awarded with a main draw wildcard, but lost to [[Anna Tatishvili]] in the first round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blick.ch/sport/tennis/tatishvili-anna-bencic-belinda-id2372382.html|title=Belinda Bencic bezahlt Lehrgeld|first=Simon|last=H<U+00E4>ring|work=[[Blick]]|date=16 July 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|language=German}}</ref>
