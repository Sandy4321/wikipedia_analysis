The '''Village of Pouce Coupe''' ''([[French language|French]] for "cut-off thumb")'' is a small [[town]] in northeastern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], and a member [[municipality]] of the [[Peace River Regional District, British Columbia|Peace River Regional District]]. The 2.06&nbsp;[[kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (0.80&nbsp;[[mile|mi<U+00B2>]]) municipality is home to around 887 residents.<ref>BC Stats (March 22, 2006). [http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/dd/facsheet/cf265.pdf "Pouce Coupe Village" (pdf)], ''Community Facts'', Retrieved [[30 March]] [[2006]].</ref>

The community was settled by [[Europe|European]] immigrant Hector Tremblay in [[1898]]. Pouce Coupe is approximately 10 km (6 miles) southeast of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]] along [[British Columbia provincial highway 2|Highway 2]]. It is approximately 35 km (22 miles) northwest of the [[Alberta]] border along Highway 2. The village is at an elevation of 655 metres (2168 ft) in the [[Peace River Country]].

Pouce Coupe's main industries today are [[petroleum]], [[agriculture]], and [[tourism]]. Popular recreational activities in the area include [[cross-country skiing]], [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[fishing]], [[hiking]], and [[hunting]].

==History==
After the French-Canadian [[voyageur]]s Hector Tremblay and Joe Bissette left their group of prospectors from [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], they became the first settlers in the Pouce Coupe Prairie.<ref>Tuck, 1-2</ref> In 1898 Bissette built his cabin in the present day Pouce Coupe Regional Park at the confluence of Bissette Creek and Pouce Coup<U+00E9> River, but soon moved on to Dunvegan, Alberta. Tremblay, joined by his wife and children in 1908, built his cabin at the confluence of Dawson Creek and Pouce Coup<U+00E9> River. Tremblay used his cabin as a trading post for local aborinal tribe and resting place for the trickle of travellers that passed through. He also tried ranching cattle and helped cut trails south to [[Grande Prairie, Alberta|Grande Prairie]] and north to [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]]. When the Dominion Government opened the [[Peace River Block]] for homesteading, the trails created an influx of settlers between 1912 and 1914. A community began to emerge around Tremblay's cabin as he ran a small store and post office aided inexperienced settlers. This community center moved in 1916 when the post office moved to Frank Haskin's general store and a bank opened nearby.<ref>Tuck, 1-6</ref>

After WWI homestead grants to returning soldiers created another wave of settlers and the community center moved to its present location in the early twenties when the post office and other businesses moved to a newly subdivided townsite on Charlie LeRoy's homestead. Until 1932 Pouce Coupe would be the service center for the region.<ref>Tuck, 12</ref> The federal government established an office in the emerging village in 1915 and provincial government followed in 1921. The first school opened in 1917, the Alberta Red Cross opened a hospital in 1921, and the Pouce Coupe Light and Power Co. was established in 1931.<ref>*"The Pouce Coupe Story" in ''Lure of the South Peace'', pg 848-853.</ref>

As [[Northern Alberta Railways]] was extending their rail lines westward, to [[Wembley, Alberta]] in  1924 and to [[Hythe, Alberta]] in 1928, it was expected that Pouce Coupe would be next in line. However, as land prices rose and speculation increased, the company made a deal to build the next station near the smaller community of Dawson Creek.<ref>[http://www.calverley.ca/Part05-Dawson%20Creek/5-008.html The Choice of Terminal for the N.A.R..] Dorthea Calverley, 1983. URL accessed on xx December 2006.</ref> The first train went through Pouce Coupe and arrived in Dawson Creek in on [[January 15]] [[1931]]. Despite the Great Depression and Dawson Creek's increasing dominance over the region as the westernmost rail connection, Pouce Coupe continued to grow, and incorporate as a village, as Prairie farmers moved westward into the [[Peace River Country]].<ref>"The Pouce Coupe Story" in ''Lure of the South Peace'', pg 848-853.</ref>

The 1941 census recorded 251 people living in the village. In 1942 the population swelled, as the US Army unloaded men and materials in Dawson Creek to build the [[Alaska Highway]], and Pouce Coupe was used to house men and store material. The highway was built and the US Army gone within a year but by 1951 the population that remained numbered 459 residents. The village was connected to drinking water and sewage system in 1950, and a natural gas in 1954.<ref>Tuck, 25 and 28.</ref> In large part because of the Women's Institute a library opened in 1951 and a new hospital in 1954.<ref>Tuck, 19.</ref> In the following decades the village would remain in the shadow of Dawson Creek as the provincial and federal government offices moved there in the 1970s. The population level fluctuated between 812 and 928 people from 1977 to 2005, the peak of 928 people occurring in 1996.<ref>BC Stats, Municipal Census Populations, 1976<U+2013>2006.</ref>

According to the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Canadian census]],<ref name=statscan>Statistics Canada, [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5955005&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Pouce%20Coupe&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= Community Highlights for Pouce Coupe], ''2001 Community Profiles'', [[November 27]] [[2005]].</ref> Pouce Coupe had 833&nbsp;residents living in 275&nbsp;[[household]]s. Among these, 31% were married couples with children, 20% were married couples without children, and 29% were one-person households. Of 190&nbsp;reported [[Family|families]], 63% were [[Marriage|married]] couples (with an average 3.2&nbsp;persons per family), 21% were lone parents (3.0&nbsp;persons per family), and 18% were [[Common-law marriage|common-law]] couples (3.3&nbsp;persons per family). Pouce Coupe residents' median age &mdash; 39.6 years &mdash; is a little higher than the provincial average of 38.4 years; indeed 21.7% of residents are over 65 years old, which is more than the 13.6% province-wide average. In fact, 16% of residents over 20 years old are widowed, which is much higher than the provincial average of 6%. [[Protestantism]] (31%) and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (22%) are Pouce Coupe<U+2019>s dominant religions. About 3% of residents reported themselves as being [[visible minority|visible minorities]] (significantly lower than the 21% provincial average).

==Transportation and infrastructure==
[[British Columbia provincial highway 2]] runs north-south through Pouce Coupe, connecting the town to Dawson Creek (10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) northwest) and [[Alberta]] (x&nbsp;km (xx&nbsp;mi) southeast). Pouce Coupe's internal street network has 14&nbsp;km (9&nbsp;mi) of paved and 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) of unpaved road.<ref name=redbook>Reed Construction (2005), ''Municipal redbook: an authoritative reference guide to local government in British Columbia'', Burnaby, BC, 56. ISBN 0068-161X {{Please check ISBN|0068-161X (too short)}}</ref> The village's commercial activities are centered around the bend in highway. The residential areas are located mostly south of the highway with a gridiron layout. Industry is located north of the highway and agriculture to the west.

Pouce Coupe does not have rail, air, and bus services within its borders but uses those services as they are available in Dawson Creek. The rail lines actually goes through Pouce Coupe, through the north beside by the highway and southwestern corner, but does not stop. The next place the train stops, after leaving Dawson Creek and going south through Pouce Coupe, is in [[Hythe, Alberta]]. Pouce Coupe is serviced by the [[Dawson Creek Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA code]]YDQ) which is located in the southeastern corner of the Dawson Creek municipal borders. The airport was built in 1963 and had its 1,524 m (5,000 ft) runway paved in 1966. Regional bus service, as offered by[[Greyhound Bus Lines]], is accessed through Dawson Creek.

The Village's [[water supply|drinking water]] is supplied by the City of Dawson Creek. The water is drawn from the Kiskatinaw River 16 km west of the city and pumped through a booster pump station, a settling pond, a storage pond and a water treatment plant where it is chlorinated. The Village's [[Sewage treatment|sewage]] is collected by 7&nbsp;kilometres (4&nbsp;mi) of [[sanitary sewer]]s and processed through a two-cell [[Aerated lagoon|lagoon]] system.<ref name=redbook/>

The only school in the village is the Pouce Coupe Elementary School. The school has the capacity for 450 students but the enrollment was only 113 students in 2005.<ref>Dawson Creek Catholic Social Services (2005) [http://www.dawsoncreek.ca/news/documents/IntheNewsVol32005_000.pdf Pouce Coupe Elementary School] Dawson Creek: In the News. Vol. III. pg 14.</ref> It is one of the worst elementary schools in the province in terms of academic performance.<ref>Cowley, Peter, Stephen T. Easton, and The Fraser Institute (April 2005) [http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/chapterfiles/70BCEEL05RANK.pdf# Ranking the schools] Report Card on British Columbia<U+2019>s Elementary Schools <U+2014> 2005 Edition. pg 123.</ref> Pouce Coupe students commute to South Peace Secondary School in Dawson Creek for high school education. [[Northern Lights College]], also in Dawson Creek, is the closest post-secondary school.

Pouce Coupe is located in the westen portion of the [[Peace River Country]] amidst the Pouce Coupe Prairie. It is in the B.C. Peace Lowland ecosection of the Canadian Boreal Plains [[ecozone]]. The village slopes southeastwards towards the confluence of Bissette Creek, which flows along its southern border, and Pouce Coupe River which flows northward along its eastern border. Deer, elk, moose are common.<ref>Tuck, 1</ref> The general area, located in the [[Cordillera Climatic Region]], has a subhumid low boreal [[ecoclimate]] and experiences a cool [[continental climate]], with an annual average temperature of 1.4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (34.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).<ref>The South Peace Regional Profile, pg. 62</ref>. The summers are warm and dry resulting from Pacific air masses that lose much of their moisture going through a number of mountain ranges. The winters are frigid from exposure to the Arctic air masses, however, the village experiences heavy winds year round. Because it experiences long daylight hours in summer and short daylight hours in winter, the village uses [[Mountain Standard Time]] year-round.

The 2001 Canadian census recorded 315 income-earners over the age of 15 residing in Pouce Coupe; of these, 110 worked full-time throughout the year.<ref name=statscan/> The village has both higher  [[unemployment]] and [[poverty line|poverty]] rates and lower [[labor force|participation rate]] than the provincial averages. The low participation rate reflects the relatively old population which consists of retired rural farmers and residents. Being a retirement destination, the two largest employers in Pouce Coupe in 2005 were two healthcare homes.<ref>South Peace Regional Profile, 72</ref> Industrial business is concentrated in the highway and oil & gas field construction and servicing.<ref>South Peace Regional Profile, 72</ref> Being only about 10 km from Dawson Creek's downtown and industrial park, residents commute to the larger city for employment, shopping and services. In 2001, there existed a male-female [[economic inequality|income gap]] of about $25,000, from full time-full year income-earners. The difference is attributed to Pouce Coupe females who make mcuh less than the provincial average while the men made about the same.<ref name=statscan/>

==Culture, recreation and media==
There are few cultural or recreational spots, and no newspapers or television/radio stations operating within the village. The municipality operates the Pouce Coupe Municipal Library and two parks: Village Square and Harden Park. A volunteer historical society runs the Pouce Coupe & District Museum which is housed in old train station. With Dawson Creek so close, their media outlets such as [[CJDC-TV]] and the ''Peace River Block Daily News'' cover the village and many Pouce Coupe residents use cultural and recreational facilities there. The South Peace Community Multiplex, located between the city and the village and partly funded by the village, will have, once opened in 2007, an aquatic centre with an olympic-sized swimming pool, an indoor equestrian centre, and an indoor running track.<ref>[http://www.southpeacemultiplex.com/ South Peace Multiplex.] City of Dawson Creek. URL accessed on [[4 January]] [[2007]].</ref> The Peace River Regional District manages the Pouce Coupe Regional Park, on the southern border of the municipality, which is has an amphitheatre and camping spots. Nearby provincial parks include the [[Sudeten Provincial Park]], [[Swan Lake Provincial Park]], and [[One Island Lake Provincial Park]] all to the south. Bear Mountain, to the west, has a downhill ski complex and an extensive trail system used for motorized and non-motorized recreation.
