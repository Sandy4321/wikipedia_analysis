Cambridge took a slight lead but Oxford soon recovered to become level, and by the Mile Post were three seconds ahead.<ref name=lucky/>  Shortly after, the Cambridge number 7, Nick Grundy [[Glossary of rowing terms#The stroke|caught a crab]], causing his boat to "shudder to a halt."<ref name=lucky/>  Oxford slowly extended their lead; nine seconds ahead at [[Hammersmith Bridge]], eleven seconds by the Chiswick Steps and fifteen by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].
