The '''Anglo<U+2013>Cherokee War''' (1758<U+2013>1761; in the [[Cherokee language]]: the ''"war with those in the [[Red coat (British army)|red coats]]"'' or ''"War with the English"''), was also known from the Anglo-European perspective as the '''Cherokee War''', the '''Cherokee Uprising''', or the '''Cherokee Rebellion'''. The war was a conflict between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] forces in [[North America]] and [[Cherokee]] Indian tribes during the [[French and Indian War]]. The British and the Cherokee had been allies at the start of the war, but each party had suspected the other of betrayals. Tensions between British-American settlers and the Cherokee increased during the 1750s, culminating in open hostilities in 1758.

==Prelude==
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
After siding with the [[Province of Carolina]] in the [[Tuscarora War]] of 1711<U+2013>1715, the Cherokee had turned on their British allies at the outbreak of the [[Yamasee War]] of 1715<U+2013>1717, until switching sides, once again, midway through the war. This action ensured the defeat of the [[Yamasee]]. The Cherokee then remained allies of the British until the French and Indian War.

At the 1754 outbreak of the war, the Cherokee were allies of the British, taking part in campaigns against [[Fort Duquesne]] (at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]) and the [[Shawnee]] of the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1755, a band of Cherokee 130-strong under [[Ostenaco]] (or ''Ustanakwa'') of [[Tomotley|''Tamali'']] took up residence in a fortified town at the mouth of the [[Ohio River]] at the behest of the [[Iroquois]] (who were also British allies).<ref>Tanner, p. 95</ref>

For several years, French agents from [[Fort Toulouse]] had been visiting the [[Overhill Cherokee]] on the [[Hiwassee River|Hiwassee]] and [[Tellico River]]s, and had made inroads into those places. The strongest pro-French Cherokee leaders were Mankiller (''Utsidihi'') of [[Great Tellico|''Talikwa'']], Old Caesar of Chatuga (or ''Tsatugi''), and Raven (''Kalanu'') of [[Great Hiwassee|''Ayuhwasi'']]. The "[[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|First Beloved Man]]" (or ''Uku'') of the nation, [[Kanagatucko|''Kanagatoga'']] (or "Stalking Turkey", aka 'Old Hop'), was very pro-French, as was his nephew, [[Standing Turkey|''Kunagadoga'']], who succeeded him at his death in 1760.<ref>Brown, ''Eastern Cherokee Chiefs''</ref>

The former site of the [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa Chiefdom]] was reoccupied in 1759 by a [[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]] contingent under Big Mortar (''Yayatustanage'') in support of the pro-French Cherokee then residing in Great Tellico and Chatuga. This was a step toward his planned alliance of Muscogee, Cherokee, Shawnee, [[Chickasaw]], and [[Catawba people|Catawba]] (which would have been the first of its kind in the South). Although such an alliance did not come into being until the days of Dragging Canoe, Big Mortar still rose to leading chief of the Muscogee after the French and Indian War.<ref>Heard, p. 255</ref><ref>Adair, pp. 254-256, 268-272</ref>

==Early stages==
The Anglo<U+2013>Cherokee War broke out in 1758 when Virginia militia attacked [[Moytoy of Citico|Moytoy]] (''Amo-adawehi'') of [[Citico (Cherokee town)|Citico]] in retaliation for the requisition of some horses by the Cherokee. Moytoy's reaction was to lead retaliatory raids on the [[Yadkin River|Yadkin]] and [[Catawba River|Catawba]] Rivers in North Carolina<ref name="Oliphant">Oliphant, pp. 72-78, 110-111</ref> which began a domino effect that ended with the murders of 23 Cherokee hostages at [[Fort Prince George (South Carolina)|Fort Prince George]] near [[Keowee]] and the massacre of the garrison of [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] (''Itsati''). 

These events ushered in a war which didn't end until 1761. The Cherokee were led by [[Oconostota|''Aganstata'']] of Chota, [[Attakullakulla]] (''Atagulgalu'') of [[Tanasi]], Ostenaco of Tomotley, Wauhatchie (''Wayatsi'') of the Lower Towns, and Round O of the Middle Towns. 

During the second year of the French and Indian War, the British had sought Cherokee assistance against the [[French (people)|French]] and their Indian allies.

The English had reports, which proved accurate, that indicated the French were planning to build forts in Cherokee territory (as they had already done with Ft. Charleville at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Great Salt Lick]] on the [[Cumberland River]]); Ft. Toulouse, near present day [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; Ft. Rosalie at [[Natchez, Mississippi]]; Ft. St. Pierre at modern day [[Yazoo, Mississippi]]; and Ft. Tombeckbe on the [[Tombigbee River]]). Once the Cherokee agreed to be their allies, the British hastened to build forts of their own in the Cherokee lands, completing Fort Prince George near [[Keowee]] in South Carolina (among the Lower Towns); and Fort Loudoun (near Chota at the mouth of the [[Tellico River]]) in 1756. Once the forts were built, the Cherokee raised close to 700 warriors to fight in western [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] under Ostenaco. Oconostota and Attakullakulla led another large group to attack Fort Toulouse.

In 1758, the Cherokee participated in the taking of [[Fort Duquesne]] (present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].) However, they felt their efforts were unappreciated. While traveling through Virginia, on their way home, several Cherokee were murdered by Virginians. The Cherokee had been promised supplies, but misunderstood where they were to get them from.  After taking some horses they believed were rightly theirs, several Virginians killed and scalped between 30 to 40 of them. Later, the Virginians claimed the scalps as those of Shawnees and collected bounties for them.<ref>Mooney, p. 41. Anderson, p. 458.</ref>

==War==
While some Cherokee leaders still called for peace, others led retaliatory raids on outlying pioneer settlements. The Cherokee finally declared open war against the British in 1759 (but were fighting independently and not as allies of [[France]]). A number of Muskogee under Big Mortar moved up to Coosawatie. These people had long been French allies in support of the Cherokee pro-French faction centered in Great Tellico.

The governor of [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], [[William Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|William Henry Lyttelton]], embargoed all shipments of gunpowder shipments to the Cherokee and raised an army of 1,100 men which marched to confront the Lower Towns of the Cherokee. Desperate for ammunition for their fall and winter hunts, the nation sent a delegation of moderate chiefs to negotiate. The twenty-nine chiefs were taken prisoner<ref name="Anderson, p. 460">Anderson, p. 460.</ref> as hostages and sent them, escorted by the provincial army,<ref name="Anderson, p. 460"/> to Fort Prince George. Lyttleton thought this would ensure peace.

Governor Lyttleton returned to Charleston, but the Cherokee were still angry, and continued to attack frontier settlements into 1760. In February 1760, they attacked Fort Prince George in an attempt to rescue their hostages. The fort's commander was killed. His replacement massacred<ref>Anderson, p. 461.</ref> all of the hostages and fended off the attack. The Cherokee also attacked [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Fort Ninety Six]], but it withstood the siege.

The Cherokee expanded their retaliatory campaign into North Carolina, as far east as modern day Winston-Salem.  An attack on [[Fort Dobbs (North Carolina)|Fort Dobbs]] in [[North Carolina]] was  repulsed by [[Hugh Waddell (general)|General Hugh Waddell]]. However, lesser settlements in the North and South Carolina back-country quickly fell to Cherokee raids.

[[File:Draught of the Cherokee Country.jpg|thumb|250px|Timberlake's "Draught of the Cherokee Country"]]

Governor Lyttleton appealed for help to [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], the British commander in North America. Amherst sent [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton|Archibald Montgomerie]] with an army of 1,200 troops (the [[Royal Scots]] and [[77th Regiment of Foot (Montgomerie's Highlanders)|Montgomerie's Highlanders]]) to South Carolina. Montgomerie's campaign razed some of the Cherokee Lower Towns, including [[Keowee (Cherokee town)|Keowee]]. It ended with a defeat at [[Battle of Echoee|Echoee (''Itseyi'') Pass]] when Montgomerie tried to enter the Middle Towns territory. Later in 1760, the Overhill Cherokee defeated the British colonists at Fort Loudoun and took it over.

In 1761, Montgomerie was replaced by [[James Grant (British Army officer)|James Grant]]. He led an army of 2,600 men (the largest force to enter the southern [[Appalachians]] to date) against the Cherokee. His army moved through the Lower Towns, defeated the Cherokee at Echoee Pass, and proceeded to raze about 15 Middle Towns while burning fields of crops along the way.

==Treaties==
In November 1761, the Cherokee signed the '''Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston''' with the [[Colony of Virginia]]. They made peace with South Carolina the following year in the '''Treaty of Charlestown'''. Lt. [[Henry Timberlake]], Sgt. [[Thomas Sumter]], William Shorey, who served as their interpreter, and an unknown servant traveled into the Overhill area to deliver a copy of the treaty with Virginia to the Cherokee. Timberlake's diary and map of his journey (''see to the right of text''), were published in 1765. His diary contained what historians assessed was an accurate description of Cherokee culture. 

Pro-French leader, Standing Turkey, was deposed and replaced as "First Beloved Man" with the pro-British Attakullakulla. [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]] became British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern District, based out of [[Charlestown, South Carolina]], and was the main liaison between the Cherokee and the British government. His first deputy, Alexander Cameron, lived among the Cherokee, first at Keowee, then at Toqua on the [[Little Tennessee River]], while his second deputy, John McDonald, resided a hundred miles to the southwest on the west side of Chickamauga River where it was crossed by the [[Great Indian Warpath]].

During the war, a number of Cherokee towns had been destroyed under General Grant and were never reoccupied. The most notable of these was [[Kituwa]], the inhabitants of which migrated west, taking up residence at [[Mialoquo (Cherokee town)|Great Island Town]] (on the Little Tennessee), living among the Overhill Cherokee.<ref>Klink and Talman, p. 62</ref> As a result of the war, Cherokee warrior strength estimated at 2,590 before the war in 1755<ref>Mooney, p. 39, 2,590 in 1755; 5,000 in 1739 before the great [[smallpox]] epidemic.</ref> was now reduced by battle, smallpox and starvation to 2,300.<ref>Mooney, p. 45.</ref>

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the war, French [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] went to the British, along with Canada, while Louisiana west of the Mississippi went to Spain; in return, [[Spanish Florida]] went to Britain, which divided it into [[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]]. 

After the conclusion of the treaties, [[Henry Timberlake]] visited [[London]] with three Cherokee leaders: Ostenaco, Standing Turkey, and Wood Pigeon (''Ata-wayi'').<ref>Evans, Ostenaco</ref> The Cherokee visited the [[Tower of London]], met the playwright [[Oliver Goldsmith]], drew massive crowds, and had an audience with [[King George III]]. On the voyage to England, their interpreter, William Shorey, died. This made communication nearly impossible. Hearing of the Cherokees' warm welcome in London, South Carolinians viewed their reception as a sign of imperial favoritism at the colonists' expense, especially in view of the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which prohibited settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], laying the foundation of one of the major irritants for the colonials leading to the [[American Revolution]].
