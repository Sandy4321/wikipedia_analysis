The '''2010 Claxton Shield''' was the 57th [[Claxton Shield]] tournament, the premier [[baseball]] competition in [[Australia]], and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010. It was hailed as the precursor to the new [[Australian Baseball League]] that will start in the place of the Claxton Shield in late 2010 to early 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball.com.au/default.asp?Page=58480|last=Collins|first=Kingsley|date=9 October 2009|title=Anticipation builds for Claxton Shield|publisher=Baseball Victoria|accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref> The [[Victoria Aces]] defeated [[South Australia (baseball team)|South Australia]] two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament; this was the 22nd time the Claxton Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team.<ref name=gf2report>{{cite web | url=http://www.claxtonshield.baseball.com.au/default.asp?Page=62430 | title=Victoria claim the 2009/10 Domino's Claxton Shield | last=Laidlaw | first=Robert | publisher=[[Australian Baseball Federation]] | date=6 February 2010 | accessdate=7 February 2010 }}</ref> The competition was sponsored by [[Domino's Pizza Enterprises|Domino's Pizza]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.claxtonshield.baseball.com.au/site/baseball/CLAXTONSHIELD/claxton2009/image/australian_baseball.jpg | title=2010 Claxton Shield website banner | accessdate=24 January 2010 | work=[http://www.claxtonshield.baseball.com.au/ 2010 Claxton Shield] | publisher=[[Australian Baseball Federation]] | format=JPG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.perthheat.baseball.com.au/?Page=60290 | title=Domino<U+2019>s announces sponsorship of Australia<U+2019>s premier baseball competition | date=20 November 2009 | accessdate=26 January 2010 | publisher=[[Baseball WA]] }}</ref>

== Overview ==
{{also|Australian Baseball League#New Australian Baseball League|l1=New Australian Baseball League}}
In June 2009, it was announced that the rights to the [[Claxton Shield]] had been sold to a new [[Australian Baseball League]] (ABL), with ownership split between [[Major League Baseball]]'s 75&nbsp;percent share and the 25&nbsp;percent share owned by the [[Australian Baseball Federation]]. The 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural ABL season starting in 2010&ndash;11.<ref name="abl faq" /> It varied from the [[2009 Claxton Shield]] by expanding the season to include ten rounds. Since an uneven number (five) teams were involved, four teams paired off for each round and played a three-game series, while the remaining team took a [[bye (sports)|bye]]. During the season, each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team, one at [[home (sports)|home]] and one [[road (sports)|away]]. In total, the schedule allowed for 24 regular-season games per team before a [[playoffs|postseason]] similar to the 2009 edition: the first-place  team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third-place teams.<ref name=schedule />

During the regular season, games were played on a Friday night and a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] on Saturday; in each doubleheader one of the two games was shortened to seven innings. The exception to this was when Perth played their home games; they played on a Thursday night instead of a doubleheader on Saturday. Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday, Saturday and Sunday.<ref name=schedule />

== Teams ==
=== Rosters ===
{{Main|2010 Claxton Shield team rosters}}
The 2010 series allowed each team to make use of a 19-man active roster.<ref name="abl faq" /> Exceptions were made in two cases that allowed teams' active rosters to expand to 21&nbsp;players, both times for the same reason. Two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather. Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season; make-up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams, and this resulted in two four-game series. In both cases, the teams had a 19-man roster for the make-up game, and an expanded 21-man roster for the originally scheduled series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vpbl.baseball.com.au/default.asp?Page=61701 | title=Season at a pivotal stage for both clubs | publisher=Victorian Provincial Baseball League | date=13 January 2010 | accessdate=8 April 2010 | last=Collins | first=Kingsley }}</ref>

=== Venues ===
The 2010 Claxton Shield was contested between five teams from around Australia. In previous years, many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues. This season each team held their home games at only one venue. There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season: the [[New South Wales Patriots]]' final home series against the [[Perth Heat]] was held at [[Gilchrist Oval]], whereas all of their other home games were held at [[Blacktown Baseball Stadium]].<ref name=schedule />

The 2010 Claxton Shield made use of the same finals structure as had been used in the [[2009 Claxton Shield|2009]] season. The top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular-season games qualified. The second- and third-place teams faced in each other in a best-of-three series hosted by the second-place team. The winner of that series then faced the first-place team for a best-of-three series. [[South Australia (baseball team)|South Australia]] hosted the [[New South Wales Patriots]] at [[Norwood Oval]], [[Adelaide]], while the [[Victoria Aces]] hosted the championship series at [[La Trobe University]], [[Melbourne]].<ref name=schedule /> In the finals, the home team and away team alternated during each of the series.
