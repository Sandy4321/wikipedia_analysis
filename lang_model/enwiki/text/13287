===2008===
Murphy began the season with the Double-A [[Binghamton Mets]].<ref name="minor profile" />  On August 2, a day after being promoted to the [[AAA (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[New Orleans Zephyrs]], the Mets left-handed reserve outfielder [[Marlon Anderson]] was placed on the [[disabled list]], so Murphy was called up to the majors.<ref name="callup"/>  In his first major league [[at bat]], against three-time All-Star [[Roy Oswalt]], Murphy hit a [[Single (baseball)|single]]. Later in the same game, he made a difficult catch against the left field wall, throwing out [[Hunter Pence]] at [[second base]] for a [[double play]] to end the inning.<ref name="1st game">{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2008/08/murphys_law_applies_to_ny_mets.html|title=Murphy's Law applies to NY Mets bullpen in 5-4 loss to Astros|last=Cothran|first=Jeremy|date=2008-08-03|publisher=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref>  As of August 9, 2008, Murphy was only the 5th Mets rookie to record 10 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in his first 20 at-bats.

Although he is a natural [[third baseman]], Murphy began to play [[left field]] in 2008, and continued in 2009, due to the presence of [[David Wright (baseball)|David Wright]] on the Mets.<ref name="callup">{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080802&content_id=3241671&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Murphy called up; Anderson to DL; Mets prospect makes debut in left field against Oswalt|last=DiComo|first=Anthony|date=2008-08-03|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> Murphy had a hard time transitioning to left field.
