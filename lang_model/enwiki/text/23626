'''Interstate&nbsp;287''' ('''I-287''') is an [[auxiliary Interstate Highway]] in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York]]. It is a partial [[beltway]] around [[New York City]], serving the northern half of New Jersey and the counties of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in New York. I-287, which is signed north<U+2013>south in New Jersey and east<U+2013>west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township, New Jersey]] clockwise to the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) in [[Rye, New York]], for {{convert|98.72|mi|km|2}}.  Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater Township]], the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;202]]. The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], I-287 turns east on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87|I-87]]) and runs though Rockland County. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]], I-287 splits from I-87 near [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and continues east through Westchester County on the '''Cross-Westchester Expressway.'''

A bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as '''Interstate&nbsp;187''', opened in 1960 as '''Interstate&nbsp;487''' before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the '''Middlesex Freeway'''. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US&nbsp;202 in [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]] opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder opened in 1994. A replacement of the aging Tappan Zee Bridge is planned, with construction to start in 2012. In addition, a [[Long Island Sound link|proposed tunnel]] across the [[Long Island Sound]] between Rye and [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]] on [[Long Island]] would link the eastern terminus of I-287 to [[New York State Route 25|NY&nbsp;25]] and [[New York State Route 135|NY&nbsp;135]] in [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]].
