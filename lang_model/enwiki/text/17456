'''Anthony Michael Brooks''' is an American [[speedcuber]], a competitive solver of the [[Rubik's Cube]] and related twisty puzzles. He has set continental records in three different events<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2008SEAR01</ref> recognized by the [[World Cube Association]] (Rubik's Cube, Pyraminx<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-839IV8rI</ref> and 3x3 Multiple Blindfolded<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z03H4uarO9Q</ref>) and in the process has broken 77 national records for Belize<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=Belize&eventId=&years=&slim=Slim</ref> and the United States. Brooks began his cubing career representing Belize, but subsequently switched to American nationality in January 2010. His specialty is speedsolving "small cubes" ([[Pocket Cube|2x2]] and [[Rubik's Cube|3x3]]) as he has been ranked in the top five<ref>http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2008SEAR01</ref> in the world in both categories. One of Brooks' more notable cubing achievements occurred on October 15, 2011 when he became the 3x3 North American record holder.<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=_North%2BAmerica&eventId=&years=&history=History</ref> He acquired the title by beating the previous continental best of 6.94 seconds held by fellow competitor, [[Rowe Hessler]], by the smallest possible margin - one hundredth of a second - at the Dayton Fall 2011.<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/node/1799</ref> His 6.93 second solve<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php</ref> ranked him fourth in the world at the time it was recorded. Brooks was also the 2011 2x2 US National Champion<ref>http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=USNationals2011</ref> and holds the world record for solving the world's largest solvable Rubik's Cube, the Groovik's Cube.<ref>http://blogs.lsc.org/2013/10/23/grooviks-cube-world-record-broken-at-lsc/</ref>
