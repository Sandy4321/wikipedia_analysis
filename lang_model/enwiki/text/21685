The company soon became one of the pioneers in the field of [[Gonzo pornography|gonzo pornography]], along with other producers like [[Ed Powers]], [[Rodney Moore]] and Evil Angel.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

In 1996, Collins established Elegant Angel as a separate company, working with directors [[Rob Zicari|Rob Black]], [[Tom Byron]], [[Van Damage]].
In 1997, Black, Byron, and Damage left Elegant Angel to form [[Extreme Associates]].

Elegant Angel has produced several award-winning video series including ''Buttwoman'', ''Big Wet Asses''<ref name=AVN06 />, ''Cumback Pussy'', and ''Sodomania''.<ref name=AVN05 />

In late 2003, Elegant Angel arranged for [[Devil's Films]] to take over the distribution of Elegant Angel titles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Devil's Distribution Takes Over Distribution for Elegant Angel|work=Adult Video News|date=[[2003-09-03]]|url=http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectID=ED9DE05E-1372-4B41-C472E79EFD8E4C80&slid=198505|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The deal was dissolved in early 2004. Elegant Angel halted production for two months, and Collins refocused the company on producing niche-themed pornography. The company was then producing as many as eight new titles a month. <ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2DF153EF937A1575BC0A9629C8B63 nytimes.com]</ref>
