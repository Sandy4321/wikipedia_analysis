[[Scotland]] is a land of diverse [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural heritage. Various languages spoken there over the years fall into two general categories: [[Germanic languages]] and [[Celtic languages]]. The classification of the [[Pictish language]] was once controversial but it is now generally accepted to be another Celtic language. Today, the primary languages spoken are [[Scottish English]], [[Scots language|(Lowland) Scots]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]].

==Celtic languages==
{{main|Celtic languages}}
The Celtic languages of Scotland can be further subdivided into three more groups. These are the [[Goidelic languages]], otherwise known as Q-Celtic, the [[Brythonic languages]], otherwise known as P-Celtic, and the [[Pictish language]], which seems to have been distinct from both. All three groups are known collectively as the [[Insular Celtic languages]].

===Goidelic languages===
{{main|Scottish Gaelic language}}
{{further|[[Goidelic languages]]}}
The Goidelic language spoken in Scotland is [[Scottish Gaelic]]. This language arrived via [[Ireland]] due to the growing influence of the kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata|Dalriada]] from the 6th century onwards. It is still spoken in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Hebrides]], and in Scottish cities by some communities. It was formerly spoken over a far wider area than today, even in the recent past, as evidenced by placenames. [[Galwegian Gaelic]] is the extinct dialect of Scottish Gaelic formerly spoken in southwest Scotland. It was spoken by the [[independent kings of Galloway]] in their time, and by the people of [[Galloway]] and [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] until the early modern period. It was once spoken in [[Annandale]] and [[Strathnith]], as well.

Scottish Gaelic, along with modern [[Manx language|Manx]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], are descended from [[Middle Irish]], a derivative of [[Old Irish]], which is descended in turn from [[Primitive Irish]], the oldest known form of the Goidelic languages. This form of the language is known only from fragments, mostly personal names, inscribed on stone in the [[Ogham]] alphabet in [[Ireland]] and western Britain up to about the 6th century.

Goidelic languages were once the most prominent by far among the Scottish population, but now are restricted to the West. The [[Beurla-reagaird]] is a Gaelic-based [[Cant (language)|cant]] of the [[Scottish Travellers|Scottish travelling community]] related to the [[Shelta]] of Ireland.<ref>Neat, Timothy (2002) ''The Summer Walkers''. Edinburgh. Birlinn. pp.225-29.</ref>

===Brythonic languages===
{{main|Cumbric language}}
{{further|[[Brythonic languages]]}}
None of the Brythonic languages of Scotland survive to the modern day, though they have been reconstructed to a degree.

[[British language (Celtic)|British]] may have been spoken in southern Scotland in Roman times and earlier.<ref>Jackson, K. (1953) ''Language and History in Early Britain''.</ref>

The [[Cumbric language]] was spoken in the [[Hen Ogledd]] which included the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], as well as in Cumbria, in northern [[England]]. It probably became extinct in the 11th century.

===Pictish language===
{{main|Pictish language}}
The Pictish language is generally understood to be an Insular Celtic language, distinct from both the Goidelic and Brythonic languages. At its height, it may have been spoken from [[Shetland]] down to [[Fife]], but was pushed back as Scots, [[Brythons]], and [[Anglo-Saxons]] invaded Northern Britain, each with their own languages. [[Pritennic]] may have been a precursor of Pictish.<ref>Jackson K; The Pictish Language in F T Wainright "The Problem of the Picts" (1955).</ref>

==Germanic languages==
{{main|Germanic languages}}
Two [[West Germanic languages]] in the [[Anglic languages|Anglic]] group are spoken in Scotland today; [[Scots language|Scots]], and [[Scottish English]], a [[dialect]] of the [[English language]]. The [[Norn language]], a [[North Germanic language]], is now extinct.

The [[Northumbrian language|Northumbrian]] [[dialect]] of the [[Old English language]] was spoken in the [[Angle]] [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] from the [[Humber]] estuary to the [[Firth of Forth]]. The [[Viking]] invasions of the 9th century forced the dialect to split in two and in the north it began to evolve into Scots.

===Scots language===
{{main|Scots language}}
[[Early Scots]], also called ''Inglis'' was the emerging literary language of the [[Middle English]] speaking parts of Scotland in the period before 1450.
[[Middle Scots]] then became the language of the Anglic-speaking [[Scottish Lowlands]] in the period 1450 to 1700. This in turn developed into 
Scots, also called ''Lowland Scots'', or ''[[Lallans]]''. Scots is a [[pluricentric language]]. Though there have been attempts at standardising it, the language is made up of many different dialects, so much so that no one may be said to be "true" Scots more so than any other. The language's diversity is often seen as a mark of local pride among Scots. There are a variety of dialects of Scots including the [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]] of the north east, [[Orcadian dialect|Orcadian]] and [[Shetlandic]], (two dialects of the [[Northern Isles]] influenced by Norn), [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[South Scots]] spoken in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]]. A Jewish hybrid of the early 20th century is [[Scots-Yiddish]].

===Scottish English===
{{main|Scottish English}}
Scottish English is the standardised form of the English language used in Scotland. It has been heavily influenced by Scots, as well as Scottish Gaelic. In the Highlands, [[Highland English]] is the more widely spoken form of this dialect. Highland English has been more heavily influenced by Gaelic than all but [[Hebridean English]], spoken in the [[Hebrides|Western Isles]].

===Norn language===
{{main|Norn language}}
Norn is an extinct North Germanic, [[West Scandinavian languages|West Scandinavian]], language that was spoken on [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]], off the north coast of mainland Scotland, and in [[Caithness]]. Norn evolved from the [[Old Norse]] that was widely spoken in the [[Hebrides]], Orkney, Shetland and the west coast of the mainland during the Viking occupation from the 8th to the 13th centuries.  After the [[Northern Isles]] were ceded to Scotland by [[Norway]] in the 15th century, its use was discouraged by the Scottish government and the [[Church of Scotland]] (the national church), and it was gradually replaced by Lowland Scots over time. Norn died out in the 19th century.

According to the 2001 census [[Scottish Gaelic]] has 58,652 speakers (roughly 1% of the [[population of Scotland]]). In total 92,400 people aged three and over in Scotland had some Gaelic language ability in 2001.<ref name="2001census">[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/news2005/scotlands-census-2001-gaelic-report.html "News Release - Scotland's Census 2001 - Gaelic Report"] from General Registrar for Scotland website, 10 October 2005. Retrieved 27 December 2007</ref>  According to a 1996 estimate of the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] approximately 1.5 million individuals, 30% of the Scottish population, speak Scots.

==Other==
*The [[Romani language]] ([[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]) has also been spoken in Scotland, but became more or less extinct in the country during the 20th century. It has lent Scotland's other languages a number of loanwords, and has also had an effect on the Gaelic of the travelling community. Since the beginning of the 21st century increasing numbers of [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] migrants has seen the [[Romani language]] return to Scotland. The [[Govanhill]] area in [[Glasgow]] has become home to many [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma people]] and the Romani language can be heard being spoken in the area.
*Scotland's deaf community uses [[British Sign Language]]. There are a few signs used in Scotland which are unique to that country.
*During the 20th and 21st centuries immigrants from a wide variety of countries have created a complex mosaic of spoken languages amongst the resident population.
