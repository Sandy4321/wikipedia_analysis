'''Isiah "Ike" Leggett''' (born July 25, 1944) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician from [[Maryland]], USA. Born in [[Deweyville, Texas]], Leggett attended [[Southern University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and, after serving in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] with the [[U.S. Army]], earned a law degree from [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, DC]]. In 1986, he became the first [[African-American]] elected to the county council in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] and served on the council through 2002. He remains the only African-American ever elected to that body at-large. For two years, Leggett served as the chairman of the [[Maryland Democratic Party]] before leaving that position to run for office once again. Leggett was elected [[County Executive]] of Montgomery County in 2006, the first African-American to hold that office. Since taking office, he has become involved in a number of controversial issues, including proposals to increase the Maryland gas tax, place a moratorium on new development in Montgomery County, and create a new hiring location for day laborers in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].  

==Early life and education== 

Leggett was born on July 25, 1944 in [[Deweyville, Texas]] and grew up with twelve siblings in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]. In Alexandria, he played football for Peabody Magnet High School. He attended [[Southern University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], working through school as a groundskeeper in a work-study program and graduating in 1967. In his time as an undergraduate, he participated in [[civil rights]] demonstrations and was elected president of his class during his senior year. He also became a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha|Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]], the first intercollegiate fraternity established for African-Americans. A member of the Southern University [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]], Leggett served as a captain in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam conflict]] and saw action near the cities of Da Nang and Saigon. The Army awarded him a bronze star before he left to pursue a law degree and a career in politics. In 1974, he received [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] and [[Juris Doctor]] degrees from [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, DC]], graduating first in his law school class, followed soon after by a Master of Laws degree from [[George Washington University]]. He returned to Howard as a professor in their law school in 1976, and continued teaching at the law school through his election as County Executive in 2006, with the exception of a brief stint as a [[White House Fellow]] in the 1970s. Among his former students is the current Mayor of the District of Columbia, [[Adrian Fenty]]. Leggett is currently married to his second wife, Catherine.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |author= Weeks, Linton and Trejos, Nancy|title=In Montgomery, Ready to Serve |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/28/AR2006102800983_pf.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref>

==Early political career==

Leggett's first participation in county government was as an appointed member of the county Human Relations Committee, on which he served from 1979 to 1986. In 1986, he was elected as an at-large member of the county council, becoming the first African-American ever to serve on the council. To this day, he is the only African-American ever elected to county office at large. He was re-elected to the seat three more times, and served three one-year terms as council president. During his time on the council, he chaired the council's transportation and environment committee and played a role in passage of a county living wage law and a public smoking ban.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Palazzolo |author= Joe Palazzolo|title=Leggett Ups His Bid to Run the County |url= |publisher=The Sentinel |date=March 25, 2006 |accessdate=2009-11-04|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref> In 1992, a former county council aide of Leggett's accused him of sexual harassment in a widely publicized case, but the accusation was dismissed by a jury.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Sullivan|title=A Year After Trial, Leggett Enjoys Basking in Obscurity|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72113605.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+13%2C+1993&author=Kevin+Sullivan&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=B.01&desc=A+Year+After+Trial%2C+Leggett+Enjoys+Basking+in+Obscurity|publisher=The Washington Post|date=February 13, 1993|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> In 2002, Leggett declined to run for re-election to the county council. He was widely viewed as a potential running mate for Democratic nominee [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend]] in that year's gubernatorial race. However, Townsend chose Admiral [[Charles R. Larson]] instead. Townsend and Larson lost in November when Maryland elected [[Robert Ehrlich]] to be its first Republican Governor in 40 years and Lieutenant Governor [[Michael S. Steele]] as its first African-American statewide elected official. When his term on the council was completed in December of that year, Leggett was elected to a term as chairman of the [[Maryland Democratic Party]]. Leggett's chairmanship was seen by some Democratic activists as important to maintaining the African-American base of the Maryland Democratic Party following their electoral losses.<ref>{{cite news |first=Theodore |last=Kim |author= Theodore Kim|title=Leggett's Long Career Taking Another Turn |url=http://www.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2003/200302/montgomerycty/county/138051-1.html |publisher=The Gazette |date=January 10, 2003 |accessdate=2007-01-22|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref>

==2006 campaign for county executive==

Following the election of 2004, Maryland politicians started announcing their intentions for the [[Maryland state elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Among them was three-term County Executive [[Doug Duncan]], who was in the early stages of a run for Governor. In December 2004, Leggett left his position as Chair of the Maryland Democratic Party to begin a [[Maryland county executive elections, 2006|campaign]] to replace Duncan as Montgomery County Executive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mosk|first=Matthew|title=Turnover in Md.

Leggett and Silverman squared off in a long series of debates beginning almost a year before the election. But despite being outspent by Silverman, Leggett won the Democratic nomination for executive with 61% of the vote in the primary election on September 12, 2006.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite web| title = Election Summary Result, Gubernatorial Primary Election| publisher =Montgomery County Board of Elections  | date =October 10, 2006  | url =http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/elections/electionResults2006Primary/jurisdictionwide-1.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-01-22 }}</ref> Although he then faced Republican nominee Chuck Floyd and independent anti-tax advocate [[Robin Ficker]] in the general election, Leggett easily won the November polling as well.<ref>{{cite web| title = Election Summary Result, Gubernatorial General Election| publisher =Montgomery County Board of Elections  | date =November 17, 2006  | url =http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/elections/electionResults2006General/jurisdictionwidefinal-1.htm  | accessdate = 2007-01-22 }}</ref>

==First term as county executive==

In the early days of his administration, Leggett became involved in a number of controversial issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and a state budget deficit, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase. This proposal, which happened in the midst of a state budget crunch and in response to high levels of [[traffic congestion]] in the county, was supported by the county council but largely ignored by incoming [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Martin O'Malley]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Marimow |author= Ann Marimow|title=Leggett Repeats Call for Gas Tax Increase |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1178207811.html?dids=1178207811:1178207811&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&fmac=42cfd73d6989cfdf2ef21f749b5f91a8&date=Dec+12%2C+2006&author=Ann+E.+Marimow+-+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&desc=Leggett+Repeats+Call+For+Gas+Tax+Increase |publisher=The Washington Post |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Janel |last=Davis |author= Janel Davis|title=Council backs resolution for a higher gasoline tax |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/121306/montcou181515_31979.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-22|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref> 

Leggett also worked to find a hiring site for [[day labor]]ers from the city of [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]] and the surrounding upcounty area. During the term of Leggett's predecessor [[Doug Duncan]], Gaithersburg had struggled to find space within the city limits that the county could lease for use as a location where the day laborers could wait for employers. The owners of virtually all of the more than 30 sites considered by the city government had refused to grant a lease for this purpose, and in the one case where the property owner was willing to consider the use, the county's efforts to lease the property fell through after the property owner backed out.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sebastian |last=Montes |author=Sebastian Montes|title=Gaithersburg day labor center falls through |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/102706/gaitnew145409_31979.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-22|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref> The debate became caught up in a larger national debate about the role of [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] in American society.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sebastian |last=Montes |author=Sebastian Montes|title=Gaithersburg looks to regain footing on day laborer issue|url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/080906/germnew205914_31949.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=August 9, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-25|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref> Abandoning efforts to locate the site within Gaithersburg's city limits, Leggett's proposal to locate a day laborer location on county-owned land eliminated the need to find a private property owner willing to lease for this purpose. However, the decision was still contentious within the neighborhood where the site was to be located.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sebastian |last=Montes |author=Sebastian Montes|title=Montgomery picks day laborer site |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/011907/polia%20s194536_32024.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=2007-01-22|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref>

Additionally, Leggett came out in favor of a proposed partial moratorium on new [[real-estate developer|real-estate development]] in the county. This moratorium was proposed by Councilmember Marilyn Praisner, and was intended to allow the County time to reevaluate and revise its growth policy. Critics of the moratorium expressed concerns that it might cause economic harm to the county, sending the message to the business community that the county was unpredictable.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janel |last=Davis |author=Janel Davis |title=Moratorium may backfire, council told |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/122006/montcou180923_31976.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=2009-11-04|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref> Despite Leggett's support, however, the moratorium law was altered so that it did not completely stop applications for new development but rather placed increased regulation on them while the county [[urban planner|planning board]] and county council revised the county's planning process.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janel |last=Davis |author=Janel Davis |title=Moratorium off table, but developers warned |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/012407/montcou221105_31992.shtml |publisher=The Gazette |date=January 24, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-22|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref>

Dealing with a worsening economic recession and its effects on county government have dominated the second half of Leggett's first term. A number of his specific spending decisions were criticized in light of this recession. In March 2008, opponents questioned the county's use of tax payer money to build a $65,225 bathroom for Leggett's personal office. <ref>{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Marimow|title=County Executive to Get $65,000 Bathroom|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031903325.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 20, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> The project came at a time when the recession had begun to undermine tax revenues, resulting in a hiring freeze for 1,092 county government vacancies.<ref>{{cite news | last = Killian | first = Erin | title = Hiring freeze instituted in Montgomery County | newspaper = Baltimore Business Journal | date = January 4, 2008 | url = http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2007/12/31/daily31.html?ana=from_rss | accessdate = 2009-10-02}}</ref> In 2009, two former military helicopters were offered as a donation to the county for use in a police helicopter program. Leggett favored pursuing the program but faced opposition from councilmembers who criticized the cost of such a program.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cunningham, Erin and Ford, Benjamin | title = Leggett's helicopter plan moves forward | newspaper = The Gazette | date = August 26, 2009 | url = http://www.gazette.net/stories/08262009/montnew192207_32528.shtml | accessdate = 2009-10-02|location=Montgomery County, Maryland}}</ref>
