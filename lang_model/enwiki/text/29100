The '''House Martin''' (''Delichon urbicum'') is a [[bird migration|migratory]] [[passerine]] [[bird]] of the [[swallow]] family. It has a blue head and upperparts, white rump and pure white underparts. The House Martin resides in open country and near human habitation; breeding in [[Europe]], north [[Africa]] and temperate [[Asia]], and wintering in [[Sahara|sub-Saharan]] Africa and tropical Asia. It has two accepted subspecies, and is similar in appearance to two other ''Delichon'' [[martin]]s in eastern and southern Asia. 

The genus name ''Delichon'' is an [[anagram]] of the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term ''<U+03C7><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03CE><U+03BD>'' (''chel<U+012B>d<U+014D>n''), meaning 'swallow',<ref name=name>UK rec birdwatching. [http://www.xs4all.nl/~sbpoley/scinames.htm scientific bird names explained] Retrieved [[20 November]] [[2007]]</ref> and the species name ''urbicum'' (previously ''urbica'', due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar, until 2004<ref name= Sangster/>) means 'of the town' in [[Latin]]. Both the scientific and colloquial name of the bird is related to its use of man&ndash;made structures. It builds a closed cup nest from mud pellets under eaves or similar locations on buildings, and is usually a [[colonial]] breeder. It feeds on insects caught in flight.

==Taxonomy==
The House Martin was first formally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758 as a member of the genus ''[[Hirundo]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata. | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | date=1758| pages=824}}</ref> In the past, the House Martin was sometimes considered to be conspecific with  the [[Asian House Martin]] (''D. dasypus''), which breeds in the mountains of central and eastern Asia and winters in [[Southeast Asia]], and it also closely resembles the [[Nepal House Martin]] (''D. nipalense''), a resident in the mountains of southern Asia. All three ''Delichon'' martins are similar in appearance, but only ''D. urbicum'' has a pure white rump and underparts. The ''[[Delichon]]'' genus ([[Thomas Horsfield|Horsfield]] & [[Frederic Moore|Moore]], 1854) is a recent divergence 
from the [[Barn Swallow]] genus ''[[Hirundo]]''.<ref name=Turner/>

The western [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]] ''D. u. urbicum'' breeds across temperate [[Eurasia]]   east to central [[Mongolia]] and the [[Yenisei River]], and in [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and northern [[Algeria]],<ref name=BWP/> and migrates on a broad front to winter in [[Sahara|sub-Saharan]] Africa. The [[subspecies]] ''D. u. lagopodum'', described by [[Germany|German]] [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]] in 1811, breeds eastwards of the Yenisei  to [[Kolyma]] and south to northern [[Mongolia]] and northern [[China]]; it winters in southern China and [[Southeast Asia]]. Other races, like ''meridionalis'' from around the [[Mediterranean]] have been described, but the claimed differences from the nominate race are [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]], and therefore probably invalid.<ref name=Turner>{{cite book |title=Swallows & Martins : an identification guide and handbook |last=Turner |first=Angela K |coauthors= Rose, Chris |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1989 |id=ISBN 0-395-51174-7 }} p226-233</ref>

==Description==
The adult House Martin of the western nominate race is 13&nbsp;centimetres (5.1&nbsp;in) long, with a wing span of 26-29&nbsp;centimetres (10.2-11.4&nbsp;in) and a weight averaging 18.3&nbsp;grammes (0.65&nbsp;oz). It is steel-blue above with a white rump, and white underparts, including the underwings; even its short legs and toes have white downy feathering. Its bill is black. The young bird is sooty black, and some of the coverts and quills have white tips and edgings. ''D. u. lagopodum'' differs from the nominate race in that its white rump extends much further onto the tail, and the fork on the tail is intermediate in depth between that of ''urbicum'' and that of the Asian House Martin.<ref name=Turner/>

The white rump and underparts of the House Martin, very noticeable in flight,  prevent confusion with other widespread [[Palearctic ecozone|Palaeoarctic]] swallows such as the Barn Swallow, [[Sand Martin]] or [[Red-rumped Swallow]]. In Africa, confusion with [[Grey-rumped Swallow]] is possible, but that species has a grey rump, off-white underparts and long, deeply forked tail. The House Martin is a noisy species, especially at its breeding colonies. The male's song, given throughout the year is a soft twitter of melodious chirps. The contact call, also given on the wintering grounds, is a hard ''chirrrp'', and the alarm is a shrill ''tseep''.<ref name=BWP/><ref name=SASOL/>

==Behaviour==
===Habitat===
[[Image:Bysvale.jpg|left|thumb|240px|House Martin in flight]]The preferred habitat of the House Martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it is also found in mountains up to at least 2200&nbsp;metres (7200&nbsp;ft) altitude. It is much more urban than the Barn Swallow, and will nest even in city centres if the air is clean enough.<ref name=BWP/> It is more likely to be found near trees than other Eurasian swallows, since they provide insect food and also roosting sites. This species does not normally use the reed-bed roosts favoured by migrating Barn Swallows.<ref name= Mullarney >{{cite book | last = Mullarney | first = Killian | coauthors= Svensson, Lars; Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter |title = Collins Bird Guide | year = 1999 | publisher = Collins | isbn = 0-00-219728-6}}</ref><ref name = Euring>Pilastro, Andrea "[http://www.euring.org/about_euring/newsletter2/euring_swallows_italy.htm Euring Projects: The Euring swallow project in Italy]" ''Euring Newsletter'' '''2''', December 1998</ref>

It uses similar open habitats on the wintering grounds, but is less conspicuous than wintering Barn Swallows, tending to fly higher and be more nomadic. In the tropical parts of its wintering range, like [[East Africa]] and [[Thailand]], it appears to be mainly found in the higher areas.<ref name=Turner/><ref name= Lekagul>{{cite book | last = Lekagul | first = Boonsong | coauthors= Round, Philip |title = A Guide to the Birds of Thailand | year = 1991 | publisher = Saha Karn Baet | isbn = 9748567362}} p236</ref><ref name= Robson >{{cite book | last = Robson | first = Craig | coauthors= |title = A Field Guide to the Birds of Thailand | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Press | isbn = 1843309211}} p206</ref>

The House Martin returns to the breeding grounds a few days after the first Barn Swallows; like them, particularly when the weather is poor, it seldom goes straight to the nesting sites, but hunts for food over large fresh water bodies.<ref name=Coward/> There are records of wintering House Martins staying to breed in [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]],<ref name=SASOL>{{cite book |title=SASOL Birds of Southern Africa |last= Sinclair |first=Ian |coauthors= Hockey, Phil; Tarboton, Warwick |publisher=Struik|year=2002 |id= ISBN 1-86872-721-1 }} p296</ref> and, as would be expected for a long distance migrant, it has occurred as a vagrant eastwards to [[Alaska]] and west to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[Azores]].<ref name=Sibley>{{cite book | last = Sibley | first = David  | title = The North American Bird Guide | year = 2000 |publisher = Pica Press | id = ISBN 1-873403-78-4}} p322</ref><ref name=Turner/>

===Breeding===
[[Image:Ab bird 016.jpg|Collecting mud pellets for the nest|thumb]]

The House Martin was originally a cliff and cave nester, and some cliff-nesting colonies still exist, with the nests built below an overhanging rock. It now largely use human structures such as bridges and houses. Unlike the Barn Swallow, it uses the outside of inhabited buildings, rather than the inside of barns or stables. The nests are build at the junction of a vertical surface and a overhang, such as on house eaves, so that they may be strengthened by attachment to both planes.<ref name=Turner/> 

Nest building starts between late March in north Africa and mid-June in [[S<U+00E1>pmi (area)|Lapland]]. The nest is a neat closed convex cup fixed below a suitable ledge, with a narrow opening at the top.  It is constructed by both sexes with mud pellets collected in their beaks, and lined with grasses, hair or other soft materials. The mud, added in successive layers, is collected from ponds, streams or puddles.<ref name=Turner/> [[House Sparrow]]s frequently attempt take over the  nest during construction, and if they are successful the House Martins rebuild elsewhere. The entrance at the top of the cup is so small that the Sparrows cannot take over the nest once it is complete.<ref name= Coward>{{cite book | last = Coward | first = Thomas Alfred| coauthors= |title = The Birds of the British Isles and Their Eggs (two volumes)| year =  1930| publisher = Frederick Warne | isbn = }} Third edition, volume 2, p252-254</ref>  
[[Image:House Martin-Mindaugas Urbonas.JPG|thumb|left|Adult feeding young]]
The House Martin breeds colonially, and many nests are built actually in contact; there are records of colonies of thousands of nests, although less than ten is more typical. 4 or 5 white eggs are laid. The eggs average 1.9&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.33&nbsp;centimetres (0.75&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.52&nbsp;in) in size, and weigh 1.7&nbsp;grammes (0.06&nbsp;oz). The female does most of the incubation. The incubation period is normally 22<U+2013>32 days, with another 18<U+2013>23 days before the [[altricial]] chicks fledge. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, first-year birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.<ref name=Turner/> 

There are normally two broods, the nest being reused for the second brood, and repaired and reused in subsequent years. Hatching success is 90%, and fledging survival 60-80%. Average mortality for the adult is 40-70%. Third broods are not uncommon, and late nestlings are often left to starve. Although individuals aged 10 and 14 year have been recorded, most survive less than five years.<ref name=Turner/> For weeks after leaving the nest the young congregate in ever increasing flocks which, as the season advances, may be seen gathering in trees or on housetops or on the wires with Swallows. By the end of October, most Martins have left their breeding areas, though late birds in November and December are not uncommon.<ref name=Coward/>

The House Martin<U+2019>s aerial skills protect it from most predators, although it is hunted by the [[Hobby]].<ref name= Mullarney >{{cite book | last = Mullarney | first = Killian | coauthors= Svensson, Lars; Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter |title = Collins Bird Guide | year = 1999 | publisher = Collins | isbn = 0-00-219728-6}}</ref> It is most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This activity is therefore done communally, with a group of birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud.<ref name =birdguides>[http://www.birdguides.com/species/species.asp?sp=117070 Birdguides House Martin page]  Retrieved [[22 November]] [[2007]]</ref>

The House Martin has been regularly recorded as hybridising with the Barn Swallow, this being one of the most common passerine interspecific crosses.<ref name = Moller> M<U+00F8>ller, Anders Pape; Gregersen, Jens (illustrator) (1994) ''Sexual Selection and the Barn Swallow''. Oxford: Oxford University Press ISBN 0198540280 [http://books.google.com/books?id=qPh3kmnYG5MC&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&dq=barn+swallow+mobbing&source=web&ots=OgFPsh7qrn&sig=l3WxmkKguTiniShgofWKs7YuvTI#PPA245,M1 Full text]</ref> The frequency of this hybrid has led to suggestions that ''Delichon'' is not sufficiently separated genetically from ''Hirundo'' to be considered a separate genus.<ref name=Turner/>

===Diet===

The House Martin is similar in habits to the other aerial [[insectivore]]s, including the other swallows and martins and the unrelated [[swift]]s. It flies with a gliding action and catches flying insects. It has a somewhat faster wing beat, averaging 5.3 beats per second, than the Barn Swallow with 4.4.<ref name= flight>{{cite journal ||last= Liechti |first= Felix |coauthors= Bruderer, Lukas |month= |year=2002 |title= [http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/205/16/2461 Wingbeat frequency of barn swallows and house martins: a comparison between free flight and wind tunnel experiments]|journal= The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume= 205|issue= |pages= 2461<U+2013>2467| }}</ref>

In the breeding areas, [[fly|flies]] and [[aphid]]s make up much of the diet. In Europe, the House Martin takes a larger proportion of aphids and small flies than the Barn Swallow. As with that species, in the wintering area [[Hymenoptera]], especially flying [[ant]]s, are important food items.<ref name=Turner/>

==Conservation status==
The House Martin has an large range, with an estimated global extent of 10 million km<U+00B2>. Its European population is estimated to be 20-48 million individuals. Global population trends have not been quantified, although there is evidence of population fluctuations.<ref name=Turner/><ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow | first =  David  |coauthors= Perrins, Christopher M  (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |date = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 019854099X}} p1066-1069</ref> 
For these reasons, the species is evaluated as "least concern" on the 2007 IUCN Red List,<ref name=BirdLife/> and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ([[CITES]]) which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.

This is a species which has greatly benefited historically from forest clearance creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which have given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites. However, populations can fluctuate locally for a number of reasons. New housing has created more nest sites, and clean air legislation has enabled breeding in the centre of major cities like [[London]]. Conversely, poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with House Sparrows can reduce numbers.<ref name=Turner/> Widespread declines in House Martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970.<ref name = rspb>{{cite web|title= Population trends|work= House Martin |url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/h/housemartin/population_changes.asp|publisher= Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref> As an attractive bird which feeds on flying insects, the House Martin has usually been  tolerated by humans when it shares their buildings for nesting, although the accumulation of droppings below breeding birds can be a nuisance leading to some destruction of nests.<ref name=Turner/>

==In literature and culture==
[[Image:England Arms 1367-impale Confessor.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] featuring five martlets]]

This species lacks the wealth of literary references associated with its relative, the Barn Swallow, although it is possible that some of the older  mentions for that bird might equally well refer to the House Martin. [[William Shakespeare]] was clearly describing the House Martin when he says of [[Cawdor Castle]], "No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle; Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed The air is delicate." [Macbeth, Act, scene 6].<ref name= Cocker >{{cite book | last = Cocker | first = Mark | coauthors= Mabey, Richard  |title = Birds Britannica | year = 2005 | publisher = Chatto & Windus | isbn = 0701169079}} p318-9</ref> 

There are old legends, with no basis in fact, that House Martins would wall up House Sparrows by closing the entrance of the mud nest with the intruder inside, or that they would gather en masse to kill a Sparrow.<ref name= Cocker/> 

The [[martlet]], usually believed to refer to the House Martin, or possibly a swallow, was a heraldic bird with short tufts of feathers in the place of legs. It was the [[cadency]] mark of the fourth son of a noble family, and features in 
many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], including the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]s.<ref name=martlet>[http://www.baronage.co.uk/1999/corner01.html Baronage.co.uk]  Retrieved [[22 November]] [[2007]]</ref>
