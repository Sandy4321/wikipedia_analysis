==History==

The church originates from the 13th&nbsp;century, with its building continuing into the following century.  The upper part of the tower was added later, and was completed by about 1400.  The church was restored in the 19th&nbsp;century, when a [[vestry]] was added, and the porch was rebuilt.<ref name=hist>{{Citation | url = http://www.coolingchurch.org.uk/page8.htm| title = History of St James' Church| accessdate = 18&nbsp;April 2011| publisher = St James' Church}}</ref>  It was declared redundant on 19&nbsp;November 1976 and [[vesting|vested]] in the Churches Conservation Trust on 31&nbsp;May 1978.<ref>{{Citation | publication-date = | date = | year = 2011| title = Diocese of Rochester: All Schemes| edition = | volume = | series = Church Commissioners/Statistics| publication-place = | place = | publisher = [[Church of England]]| pages = 1<U+2013>2| page = | format = PDF | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://www.churchofengland.org/media/811058/rochester%20-%20all%20schemes.pdf| accessdate =18&nbsp;April 2011}}</ref>  It is now cared for by a group known as the Friends of St James' Church.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.coolingchurch.org.uk/page5.htm| title = The Friends of St James' Church| accessdate = 18&nbsp;April 2011| publisher = St James' Church}}</ref>  The church is open daily to visitors.<ref name=cct/>

==Architecture==

St James' is constructed in a variety of stone, including [[ragstone]], [[flint]] and [[chalk]], with some repairs in [[sandstone]].  The roofs are tiled.  Its plan consists of a [[nave]] with a south porch, a [[chancel]] with a south vestry, and a west tower.  The windows in the nave date from the early 14th&nbsp;century, and those in the chancel from the 15th&nbsp;century.<ref name=hg/>

The north doorway is blocked, but its 500-year-old timber door is still present, and still swings on its hinges.<ref name=cct/><ref name=hist/>  In the chancel are a triple [[sedilia]] and a double [[piscina]].  The [[baptismal font|font]] dates from the 13th&nbsp;century, and consists of a square bowl supported by five [[pier (architecture)|piers]].  The [[pulpit]] dates from the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref name=hg/>  At the west end of the church are six benches that probably date from the 14th&nbsp;century; the others were replaced in 1869.  There are four memorial slabs in the floor of the nave.  One of these is dated 1611.  Another is to the memory of Feyth Brook, who died in 1508.  She was the wife of Thomas Brook, Lord&nbsp;Cobham, who lived in [[Cooling Castle]].<ref name=cct/><ref name=hist/>  The interior of the vestry is completely lined with [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] shells, the [[emblem]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint&nbsp;James]].<ref name=hg/><ref name=cct/><ref name=hist/>  The stained glass in the east window dates from 1897; it depicts the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], and was made by [[Clayton and Bell]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.kentchurches.info/church.asp?p=Cooling| title = St James, Cooling| accessdate = 18&nbsp;April 2011| publisher = Kent Churches}}</ref>  The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of three bells, all dating from the the 17th&nbsp;century, but these are no longer ringable.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=cooling&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=COOLING| title = Cooling, S James| accessdate = 18&nbsp;April 2011| publisher = [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]}}</ref>  The single-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was probably made in about 1880 by A.&nbsp;Kirkland.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N14738| title = Kent, Cooling, St. James (N14738)| accessdate = 18&nbsp;April 2011| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>
