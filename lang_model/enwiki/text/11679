==Eurovision Final==
[[Image:ESC 2007 Greece - Sarbel-Yassou Maria2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sarbel]] at Eurovision 2007 Final in Helsinki, Finland]]
[[Sarbel]] competed with [[Yassou Maria]] in the Eurovision Final in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] on [[May 12]], [[2007]]. Greece was not required to sing in the semi-final as [[Anna Vissi]], Greece's entry at the 2006 contest, reached ninth place. 

During a draw, Greece was assigned a running order of 10 in the contest.  Sarbel appeared after 4 ballads, and before 1 disco song.  He went on stage with 4 girls with short dresses.  They used the same dance routine as the Greek National Final, but with minor changes.  Those changes included the end part, which used ribons attached to the girls skirts during the end bridge, with Sarbel acting as sort of a puppeteer. Later the ribbons were used to make a heart around Sarbel and the girls at the very end.

Greece's entry for the 2007 contest finished in 7th place with 139 points, 1 point ahead of [[Armenia]] and 6 points behind [[Belarus]].
