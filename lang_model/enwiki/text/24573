"'''You Belong with Me'''"  is a [[country pop]] song performed by American recording artist [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was co-written by Swift and [[Liz Rose]] and produced by [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]] with Swift's aid. It was released on April 18, 2009, by [[Big Machine Records]] as the third single from Swift's second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Swift was inspired to write "You Belong with Me" after overhearing a male friend of hers arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call; she continued to develop a story line afterward. The song contains many pop music elements and its lyrics have Swift desiring an out-of-reach [[Romantic interest|love interest]].

Critical reception for "You Belong with Me" was middling to positive. The song won Favorite song at [[2010 Kids' Choice Awards]],and received nominations for the Grammy Awards for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. "You Belong with Me" enjoyed commercial success as well; it became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. In the United States, the song became Swift's second best-charting single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] to date and Swift's third best-selling single. It managed to gain the largest crossover radio audience since [[Faith Hill]]'s "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]" did in 2000. The single was certified  [[RIAA certifications|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Roman White]]. The video featured Swift portraying two characters, a nerd (the protagonist and narrator) and a popular girl (the antagonist and girlfriend), while American actor [[Lucas Till]] portrayed the male lead. The video's plot centers on the protagonist secretively loving the male lead, although he has a girlfriend. The video won the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video]] at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], but during Swift's acceptance speech, rapper [[Kanye West]] interrupted, protesting in support of [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. The incident caused a reaction in the media, with most people coming to Swift's defense. The song was performed live at numerous venues, including the 2009<U+2013>10 [[Fearless Tour]], where it was the opening number. It was covered by various artists, including [[Butch Walker]] and [[Selena Gomez & the Scene]], and parodied by [[TMZ (song)|"Weird Al" Yankovic]].

I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I<U+2019>m so sorry."<ref name="cutbycut" /> Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song.<ref name="cutbycut" /> In a writing session with co-writer [[Liz Rose]], Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, "You<U+2019>re on the phone with your girlfriend / she<U+2019>s upset / she's going off about something that you said."<ref name="cutbycut" /> Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to breakup with his current girlfriend for her.<ref name="cutbycut" /> Swift described the song's concept as "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like '[[girl-next-door]]-itis.'

The lyrics to "You Belong with Me" alternate between [[narrative mode]]s, where she speaks of herself, a male friend whom she has an unrequited crush on, and his girlfriend. Greenblatt described Swift's role as a storyteller, the song being a [[narrative]] set to music, which describes concerning about love and boys "just [being] very hard to catch".<ref name="ew" />   
Craig Rosen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' believes "You Belong with Me"'s plot is "confessional" and regards scenarios themed with high school, while Swift "is the girl next door who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music".<ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /> Lucy Davies of the [[BBC]] noted, "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery of high school boys".<ref name="bbc" /> In one [[verse (popular music)|verse]], Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend.<ref name="bbc" /> In the choruses, Swift attempts "to persuade some boy to come to his senses and submit to her everygirl charms".<ref name="washingtonpost" />

"You Belong with Me"'s accompanying music video was directed by [[Roman White]]. In the video, Swift portrays both the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]], which she respectively described as "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" and "the popular girl."<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> Swift described the popular girl's persona as "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect".<ref name="onset">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'You Belong with Me'|minutes=20:45|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=[[Great American Country]]|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> Her love interest is portrayed by American actor [[Lucas Till]]; Swift met Till while acting on the set of ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' in April 2009. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his "cool look", embodying a "dreamy guy".<ref name="onset" /> In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too."<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> According to her, the video's plot is "charming"; she also said that, "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could be in her position."<ref name="onset" /> In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending.<ref name="onset" /> Swift commented, "One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me."<ref name="onset" />

The video was shot in two days in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]] and [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]], [[Tennessee]].<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> On the first day of filming, Swift used a [[body double]] in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot.<ref name="onset" /> In a scene where she appeared dancing, White replaced Swift's routine with a one having no rhythm; she recalled, "It was some of the most fun I'd had in a long time, just freaking out and doing the dumbest moves."<ref name="onset" /> On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at [[Pope John Paul II High School (Hendersonville, Tennessee)|Pope John Paul II High School]]. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students for the final prom scene. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot.<ref name="onset" /> "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good", Swift stated about filming.<ref name="onset" />

The video commences with Till arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to communicate by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance in front of a mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying "I love you" and kiss.
