The present '''Constitution of the State of Kansas''' was originally known as the '''Wyandotte Constitution''' to distinguish it from three proposed constitutions that preceded it.  The Wyandotte Constitution was drawn up at Wyandotte (now part of [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]) in July [[1859]], and was the fourth constitution voted on by the people of [[Kansas Territory]], as the battle between proslavery and antislavery forces during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] era spread to the debate over the terms of the new state's charter.

== Adoption ==
The Wyandotte Constitution was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on [[October 4]] [[1859]].  In April, 1860, the United States House of Representatives voted 134 to 73 to admit Kansas under the Wyandotte Constitution; however, there was resistance in the United States Senate. As slave states [[secede]]d from the Union, their senators left their seats and on [[January 21]], [[1861]], the Senate passed the Kansas bill. 

The admission of Kansas as a free state became effective [[January 29]], [[1861]].

== Terms ==
The constitution settled the terms of [[Kansas]]' admission to the [[United States]], particularly establishing that it would be a [[Free state (United States)|free state]] rather than a [[slave state]].  The constitution represented a pragmatic compromise over hotly-contested issues: it rejected slavery and affirmed property rights for women and their right to participate in school elections, but also denied universal [[suffrage]] for women, blacks, and Indians.  The previous proposed state constitutions were the [[Topeka Constitution]] of 1855, the [[Lecompton Constitution]] of 1857 and the [[Leavenworth Constitution]] of 1858.

Amended many times (including a [[universal suffrage]] amendment in 1912), the Wyandotte constitution is still the [[wikisource:Kansas Constitution|constitution of Kansas]].

Slavery is directly prohibited;
<blockquote>SEC. 6. There shall be no slavery in this State, and no involuntary servitude, except for the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.</blockquote>

==Preamble==
