The '''Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania''' before midnight of June 14, 1940. The [[Soviets]], using a formal pretext, demanded to allow an unspecified number of [[Red Army|Soviet soldiers]] to enter the [[Lithuania]]n territory and to form a new pro-Soviet government (later known as the "[[People's Government of Lithuania|People's Government]]"). The ultimatum and subsequent incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union stemmed from the division of Eastern Europe into the German and Russian [[spheres of influence]] in the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939. Lithuania, along with Latvia and Estonia, fell into the Russian sphere. According to the [[Soviet<U+2013>Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] of October 1939, Lithuania agreed to allow some 20,000 of Soviets troops to be station several bases within Lithuania in exchange for a portion of the [[Vilnius Region]]. Further Soviet actions to establish its dominance in its sphere of influence were delayed by the [[Winter War]] with Finland and resumed in spring 1940 when Germany was making [[Battle of France|rapid advances in western Europe]]. Despite the threat to the independence, Lithuanian authorities did little to plan for contingencies and were unprepared for the ultimatum.

With Soviet troops already stationed in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty, it was impossible to mount effective military resistance.<ref name=lane/> On June 15, Lithuania unconditionally accepted the [[ultimatum]] and lost its independence. The Soviets sought to show the world that this was not a [[military occupation]] and [[annexation]], but a legitimate [[socialist revolution]], initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union.<ref>Vardys (1997), p. 50</ref> Therefore the Soviets followed semi-legal procedures: they took control of the government institutions, installed a new [[puppet government]], and carried out [[show election]]s to the [[People's Seimas]]. During its first session the Seimas proclaimed creation of the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and petitioned to be admitted into the Soviet Union. The petition was officially accepted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] on August 3, 1940. At the same time almost identical processes took place [[occupation of the Baltic states|in Latvia and Estonia]]. Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]] on March 11, 1990.

==Background==
{{main|Soviet<U+2013>Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty}}

The [[Baltic states]] of Lithuania, [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]] were part of the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century, achieving independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The rise of [[Nazi Germany]] during the 1930s created Russian fears of an German invasion.<ref name=shearman>{{cite book|title=Russian foreign policy since 1990| author=Peter Shearman| year=1995| publisher=[[Westview Press]] |page=8 |ISBN=9780813326337 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zHuakfpPujQC&pg=PA8&lr=&client=opera}}</ref> The Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany in August 1939, in part as an attempt to delay this possibility.<ref name=shearman/> Germany shortly initiated [[World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on September 1. The secret protocols of the pact, which were reinforced by the [[German<U+2013>Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty]] of September 28, divided large portions of northeastern Europe between the two powers, and assigned Lithuania to the Soviet [[sphere of influence]].<ref>Eidintas (1999), p. 170</ref> A Lithuanian delegation was invited to Moscow, where it signed the [[Soviet<U+2013>Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] on October 10, 1939.

The political situation in Lithuania, however, remained stable between October 1939 and March 1940. The Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs<ref name=vardys47>Vardys (1997), p. 47</ref> and the Russian soldiers were well-behaved in their bases.<ref>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), p. 158</ref> As late as March 29, 1940, Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] delivered a speech before the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] expressing his satisfaction with the execution of the mutual assistance treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.<ref name=eidintas174>Eidintas (1999), p. 174</ref> While Lithuanian politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union for its generosity and touted the "traditional Soviet<U+2013>Lithuanian friendship," in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence.<ref>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), pp. 156<U+2013>157</ref> The popular attitude was reflected in the slogan "Vilnius <U+2013> m<U+016B>s<U+0173>, Lietuva <U+2013> rus<U+0173>" (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's).<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 43</ref>

The Lithuanian government had been debating its options and discussing the possibility of occupation since November 1939. At that time, the Lithuanian envoys [[Stasys Lozoraitis]], [[Petras Klimas]], and [[Bronius Kazys Balutis]] prepared a memorandum containing contingency plans. They advised strengthening the army, depositing funds abroad, reinforcing the 1934 [[Baltic Entente]] alliance with Latvia and Estonia, and investigating the establishment of a [[government-in-exile]].<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 50</ref> Although various resolutions were forwarded, nothing tangible was accomplished. During winter 1940 the Baltic Entente nations discussed greater cooperation.<ref>Rauch (2006), p. 217</ref> Mindful of their circumstances, the three governments worded their communications carefully,<ref name=mi17/> but the talks would be used as evidence that Lithuania was conspiring with Latvia and Estonia in violation of the mutual assistance treaty.

==Rising tension==
===Initial accusations===
Tensions between the Soviet Union and Lithuania escalated along with Germany's successes. By mid-March 1940, the [[Winter War]] with Finland was over and the Soviets could concentrate their attention on gaining control of the Baltic states.<ref name=an52>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 52</ref> In April, after Germany [[occupation of Denmark|occupied Denmark]], a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats.<ref name=an52/> During May, while the [[Battle of France]] was in full swing, the Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure.<ref name=lane>Lane (2001), pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref> On May 16, shortly after the German invasion of [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]], Soviet official newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'' published an article warning that it was naive for a small country to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival.<ref>Rauch (2006), p. 218</ref> Between May 18 and May 25, Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from [[Vilnius]] to [[Gai<U+017E>i<U+016B>nai]], a location much closer to the government seat in [[Kaunas]]. The action's proximity to the then-capital carried symbolic weight.<ref name=se90>Senn (2007), p. 90</ref>

On May 25, the day before the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] presented a diplomatic note that accused the Lithuanian government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty.<ref name=mis18>Misiunas (1993), p. 18</ref> The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape, and that the third, Butayev, was murdered.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book| first=Matas |last=Krygeris |title=R<U+016B>st<U+016B>s prisiminimai |chapter=K.

When found, he committed suicide.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Juozas |last=Urb<U+0161>ys| url=http://www.lituanus.org/1989/89_2_03.htm |title=Lithuania and the Soviet Union 1939-1940: the Fateful Years |journal=Lituanus | issue=34 |volume=2 |date=Summer 1989 |issn=0024-5089}}</ref> The Lithuanian government replied that the accusations were baseless, but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission. However, the commission's requests for detailed information, including interviews, photographs, physical descriptions, or other data that could further the investigation, went unanswered.<ref name=eidintas174/><ref name="an52"/> The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the investigation on its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians.<ref name=se90/>

===Direct negotiations===
On May 30, the accusations were restated, in an official communique, published by [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]], the official Soviet news agency.<ref name=se91>Senn (2007), p. 91</ref> The same day [[Stasys Lozoraitis]], Lithuanian envoy in [[Rome]], was authorized to form a [[government in exile]] in case of the Soviet occupation.<ref name=mi17>Misiunas (1993), p. 17</ref> The Lithuanian police tightened security around Soviet bases and arrested 272 suspicious individuals, but that only drew additional criticism of harassment.<ref name=se91/> Foreign Minister [[Juozas Urb<U+0161>ys]] offered to settle the matter in direct negotiations in Moscow.<ref name=mis18/> Molotov agreed to talk but only with Prime Minister [[Antanas Merkys]].<ref name=mis18/> On June 7, Merkys arrived in Moscow. The Soviets repeated the accusations of kidnapping. Other charges were leveled, including the allegation that Minister of the Interior [[Kazys Sku<U+010D>as]] and Director of State Security Department [[Augustinas Povilaitis]] had provoked Russian soldiers.<ref>Senn (2007), p. 92</ref> During the second meeting on June 9,<ref name=eidintas174/> Molotov also accused the Lithuanian government of conspiring with Latvia and Estonia to establish a secret military union (in reference to the [[Baltic Entente]]), thereby violating the mutual assistance pact.<ref name=rau219>Rauch (2006), p. 219</ref>  

On June 10, the Lithuanian government discussed the new developments. It decided that Merkys should return to [[Kaunas]] and Urb<U+0161>ys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Sku<U+010D>as and Povilaitis.<ref name=an54>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 54</ref> A personal letter from President [[Antanas Smetona]] to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet [[Mikhail Kalinin]] repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact.<ref>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), p. 178</ref> The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urb<U+0161>ys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer<ref name=se91>Senn (2007), p. 91</ref> and made no more actionable requests.<ref name=sab179/> On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed the government of the situation.<ref name=sab179>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), p. 179</ref> It was decided that Sku<U+010D>as should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness.<ref name=an54/> Lithuanian politicians did not fully understand the gravity of the situation  and did not think the results would be catastrophic.<ref name=sab179/> Urb<U+0161>ys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by [[Stasys Ra<U+0161>tikis]], former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army.<ref name=se94>Senn (2007), p. 94</ref> Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.<ref name=se94/>

===Internal crisis===
While Merkys and Urb<U+0161>ys negotiated in Moscow, the Lithuanian opposition saw an opportunity to unseat the authoritarian regime of Smetona and his [[Lithuanian National Union]]. On June 12, the [[Lithuanian Christian Democrats|Christian Democrats]] and the [[Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union|Peasant Popular Union]] met and decided to ask [[Kazys Bizauskas]] and [[Juozas Aud<U+0117>nas]] to resign from the cabinet, expecting that these resignations would trigger a government crisis.<ref name=an55>Anu<U+0161>auskas,  p. 55</ref> The opposition saw Soviet pressure as a means of ousting Smetona's regime, restoring democracy, and preserving some form of autonomy.<ref name=sab183>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), p. 183</ref><ref name=an59/> The opposition also hoped to persuade Merkys, who had just returned from Moscow, to resign along with the rest of the cabinet.<ref name=an55/> However, Merkys could not be found<U+2014>he was apparently resting at his estate near Kaunas.<ref name=an55/> This episode was harshly criticized afterwards as an illustration of several weaknesses in the Lithuanian government: it underestimated the threat posed by the Soviet Union, it was disoriented during the crisis, and its members focused on party interests rather than national priorities.<ref name=sab183/> [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] later described the opposition's actions as a "joyful dance next to the corpse of the lost state".<ref name=an59>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 59</ref>

===Military movements===
Mobilization of the [[Red Army]] had begun before the last round of meetings in Moscow. On June 7, the Army was ordered to prepare for an attack against Lithuania. As of June 5, all Soviet forces in the Baltic region were assigned to command of [[Semyon Timoshenko]], [[People's Commissar]] for Defense.<ref name=se93>Senn (2007), p. 93</ref> The Soviets gathered their forces on Lithuania's eastern border in modern-day [[Belarus]]; they consisted of five divisions and supporting units from the [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|3rd]] and the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Armies]]. The armies included 221,260 soldiers,  operating 1,140 airplanes and 1,513 tanks.<ref name=an56>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 56</ref> Lithuania already housed 18,786 Soviet troops within its territory.<ref name=an56/> At the time the [[Lithuanian Army]] comprised 28,005 troops and owned 118 planes.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia| title=Reguliariosios paj<U+0117>gos |volume=I |encyclopedia=Lietuva | editor=Ra<U+010D>is, Antanas  |year=2008 |publisher=[[Science and Encyclopaedia Publishing Institute]] |isbn=978-5-420-01639-8 |page=335}}</ref> The Soviets readied hospitals for the wounded and prisoner-of-war camps.<ref name=se93/> On June 11, under the command of General [[Dmitry Pavlov]], the Soviets finalized their attack plan and assigned specific tasks to all units.<ref name=an56/> The orders were to cross the border silently, use [[bayonet]]s as gunshots would be noticed, and to maneuver around defensive forces in order to occupy the territory more quickly.<ref name=an56/> The Soviets expected to take control of the entire territory in three to four days.<ref name=se93/>

On the night of June 14, while the Lithuanian government was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near [[Alytus]] and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas.<ref name=ei182>Eidintas (1999), p. 182</ref> At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that would serve as a rationale for a full-scale military attack.<ref name=ei182/>

==Ultimatum and acceptance==
[[File:Antanas Smetona 2.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian President [[Antanas Smetona]] fled the country shortly after acceptance of the ultimatum]]
Just before midnight on June 14,<ref name=vardys47/> while the world was focused on the imminent capitulation of [[Paris]], Molotov presented the ultimatum to Urb<U+0161>ys in Moscow.<ref name=rau219/> It reiterated the earlier charges of kidnapping Soviet soldiers and conspiracy with Latvia and Estonia. The ultimatum demanded:<ref name=sht252>Shtromas (2003), p. 252</ref>
# That Sku<U+010D>as and Povilaitis be put on trial for ordering the Soviet soldiers to be kidnapped;
# That a government, more capable of adhering to the Mutual Assistance Pact, be formed; 
# That an unspecified, but "sufficiently large" number of Soviet troops be allowed to enter Lithuanian territory;
# That an answer be given by 10:00 am the next morning.

The Lithuanian government, given less than 12 hours to respond, debated the ultimatum during the night session. President [[Antanas Smetona]] argued for military resistance, even if it were symbolic.<ref name=mis19>Misiunas (1993), p. 19</ref> Merkys and his deputy [[Kazys Bizauskas]] urged acceptance.<ref>Sabali<U+016B>nas (1972), p. 181</ref> Ra<U+0161>tikis, as the potential head of a new government, was invited to the meeting. Both former and current Chief Military Commanders Ra<U+0161>tikis and [[Vincas Vitkauskas]]<ref name="an59"/> reported that mounting an effective armed resistance, when Soviet troops were already in the country and the Lithuanian military was not mobilized, was impossible.<ref name=ei182/> Merkys and his cabinet resigned to make way for a new government led by Ra<U+0161>tikis.<ref name=sht252/> The session ended at 7:00 am with a decision to accept all Russian demands without expressing protest or complaint.<ref name=ei182/> In Ra<U+0161>tikis' view, such actions were empty and would do no more than anger the Russians.<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 60</ref> 

By noon, the Lithuanians received a reply from Moscow stating that Ra<U+0161>tikis was not a suitable candidate for Prime Minister.<ref name=mis19/> The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy [[Vladimir Dekanozov]].<ref name=rau220>Rauch (2006), p. 220</ref> Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree with the majority of his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President.<ref name=se106/> By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense [[Kazys Musteikis]] reached [[Kybartai]] and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum.<ref name=se106/> The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow [[Liepona]] rivulet.<ref name=se106/> Smetona's departure worked to the Soviets' advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule and they were able to exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr.<ref name=se106>Senn (2007), p. 106</ref>

The Red Army was scheduled to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders to take control of [[Vilnius]], [[Kaunas]], [[Raseiniai]], [[Panev<U+0117><U+017E>ys]], and [[<U+0160>iauliai]].<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 60<U+2013>61</ref> The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. On June 16, nearly identical ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, although they were given only eight hours to respond.<ref name=rau220/> With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia was even more futile.<ref name=mis19/> All three states were occupied and lost their independence.

==Aftermath==
===Legitimization of the occupation===
{{main|People's Seimas}}
One of Dekanozov's primary goals was the organization of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation.<ref name=sn83>Snyder (2004), p. 83</ref> On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation<ref>Misiunas (1993), p. 21</ref> and granted Merkys full presidential powers.<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 63</ref> On June 17, Merkys appointed [[Justas Paleckis]] the new Prime Minister<ref name=rau224>Rauch (2006), p. 224</ref> and confirmed the new government, known as the [[People's Government of Lithuania|People's Government]]. Merkys and Urb<U+0161>ys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia.<ref name=sn83/> Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer [[Vincas Kr<U+0117>v<U+0117>-Mickevi<U+010D>ius]] as Prime Minister.<ref name=rau224/> The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime.<ref name=e183>Eidintas (1999), p. 183<U+2013>184</ref> Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power rather than as a loss of independence.<ref name=e183/>

On July 1, the People's Government dissolved the [[Fourth Seimas of Lithuania]] and announced a [[show election]] to the [[People's Parliament]] to be held on July 14. An new election law was adopted on July 5. The law, in violation of the constitution,<ref>Shtromas (2003), p. 255</ref> specified that only communist organizations could propose candidates and that not more than one candidate could stand for each seat available in the parliament.<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 76</ref> The official [[electoral fraud|fraudulent]]<ref>Rauch (2006), p. 225</ref> results showed a [[voter turnout]] of 95.51% and support of 99.19% to the  communist delegates.<ref name=vardys52>Vardys (1997), p. 52</ref> Officially, however, 39 of the elected delegates were members of the [[Lithuanian Communist Party]] and 40 were independents.<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 83</ref> During its first session on July 21, the parliament proclaimed the creation of the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and petitioned the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] to accept this new republic into the Union.<ref>Misiunas (1993), p. 28<U+2013>29</ref> A 20-member Lithuanian delegation presented the case for incorporation in Moscow on August 1. The petition was accepted on August 3 and Lithuania became the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|14th republic]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=sn83/>

===Sovietization of Lithuania===
Immediately after the occupation, the new government began implementing political, economic, and social [[Sovietization]] policies. On July 1, all cultural and religious organizations were closed.<ref name=istvad>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11<U+2013>12 klas<U+0117>ms | first=R<U+016B>stis |last=Kamuntavi<U+010D>ius |coauthors=Vaida Kamuntavi<U+010D>ien<U+0117>, Remigijus Civinskas, Kastytis Antanaitis |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |page=408}}</ref> The [[Communist Party of Lithuania]], with some 1,500 members,<ref>Shtromas (2003), p. 257</ref> and its youth branch were designated the only legitimate political entities.

===Nazi occupation===
{{main|Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany}}

On June 22, 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] and within a week took control of all Lithuania. At first the Germans were greeted as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime. The Lithuanians hoped that the Germans would re-establish their independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the [[Slovak Republic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Slovak Republic]]). Organized by the [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] (LAF), Lithuanians rose in the anti-Soviet and pro-Nazi [[June Uprising in Lithuania|June Uprising]], established the short-lived [[Provisional Government of Lithuania|Provisional Government]], and declared independence. However, the Germans did not recognize the Provisional Government and established their own civil administration, the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. When the Red Army regained control of Lithuania in summer 1944 <U+2013> January 1945, the [[Lithuanian partisans]] began an armed struggle against the second Soviet occupation. An estimated 30,000 partisans and partisan supporters were killed during the guerrilla warfare between 1944 and 1953.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book | last=Vaitiek<U+016B>nas | first=Stasys | title=Lietuvos gyventojai: Per du t<U+016B>kstantme<U+010D>ius | year=2006 | publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedij<U+0173> leidybos institutas | location=Vilnius | isbn=5-420-01585-4 | pages=143}}</ref>

==Impacts and evaluation==

The June Uprising, while unsuccessful, demonstrated that many Lithuanians were determined to be independent.<ref name=jg>{{lt icon}} {{cite journal| url=http://www.aidai.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1308&Itemid=148 |journal=[[Aidai]] |title=1941 m. sukilimo istorija |author=J.

The acceptance of the ultimatum remains a highly controversial topic in Lithuania. Observers criticize the Lithuanian Army, which had been consuming some 20% of the state budget, for not staging even a symbolic resistance that would have invalidated Soviet claims that the takeover was a "socialist revolution" and a legitimate change of government.<ref name=var49>Vardys (1997), p. 49</ref> Others criticize the government of inaction: there were eight months in which to create contingency plans. Barring armed resistance, diplomatic options remained <U+2013> the Lithuanian government could have rejected the ultimatum, retreated abroad, and formed a recognized [[government-in-exile]].<ref>Anu<U+0161>auskas (2005), p. 63<U+2013>64</ref> Historian [[Alfonsas Eidintas]] points to a lack of public comprehension of the risk. Negative news about the Soviets was censored and even politicians did not believe the ultimatum would mean a complete loss of independence.<ref>Eidintas (1999), p. 180, 183</ref> Another debate centers on the lack of bloodshed. By accepting the ultimatum, the government may have avoided loss of life at the time, but its submission may also have encouraged later Soviet repressions.<ref name=var49/> The [[Russian Federation]], the successor state of the Soviet Union, continues to dispute whether the events surrounding the ultimatum and the subsequent years that Lithuania spent as a Soviet Socialist Republic constitute an occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1079617.html |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |title=Lithuania: Minister Cites Key Role Between EU And Russia| accessdate=2009-07-26 |first=Valentinas |last=Mite| date=2008-03-11| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5icYT6jSn| archivedate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=yearbook>{{cite book|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law - 2004| page=537 |publisher=[[Cambridge University]] Press |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aIeIS_iv-0kC&pg=PA537&lpg=PA537&source=bl&ots=cN46wNGtN8&sig=p2RElgVvdTBLloSdwFf9XBtY1cQ&hl=en&ei=lr1sSo77C4v2NYztgYYP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5| year=2007 |first=T. |last=McCormack |coauthors=A.
