'''Battle of Gospi<U+0107>''' ({{lang-hr|Bitka za Gospi<U+0107>}}) was fought in and around [[Gospi<U+0107>]], [[Croatia]], as a part of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], from 29 August until 22 September 1991. The battle pitted the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) stationed in five barracks in the town and paramilitaries of the [[Serbian Guard (paramilitary)|Serbian Guard]] against the [[Croatian National Guard]] (ZNG) and the [[Croatian Police|police forces]] based in Gospi<U+0107> and sent as reinforcements from other parts of Croatia. Initially, the JNA, supported by its artillery, controlled the eastern part of Gospi<U+0107> in a conflict that was fought as a static battle within the city. As the Croatian forces captured several JNA storage depots and barracks&mdash;in what was later known as the [[Battle of the Barracks]]&mdash;on 14 September, the balance started to shift as the ZNG received captured weapons. In consequence, the remaining JNA barracks in Gospi<U+0107> were captured by 20 September and the JNA and the Serbian Guard were pushed back out of the town.

The battle followed escalating ethnic tensions in the [[Lika]] region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in [[Lovinac]], an attack on a Croatian police checkpoint in [[<U+017D>uta Lokva]], and comparably small-scale fighting at the [[Plitvice Lakes incident|Plitvice Lakes]] and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospi<U+0107>&ndash;[[Plitvi<U+010D>ka Jezera]] road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes agains [[Serb]]s and [[Croat]]s in [[Gospi<U+0107> massacre|Gospi<U+0107>]] and [[<U+0160>iroka Kula massacre]]s. Military conflict in the region continued through further fighting which produced little territorial changes, before a more lasting ceasefire was produced by the [[Sarajevo Agreement]] of 2 January 1992.

==Background==
{{Main|Croatian War of Independence}}
In August 1990, [[Log Revolution|an insurrection]] took place in [[Croatia]] centred on the predominantly [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]]-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around the city of [[Knin]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}</ref> as well as in parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], and [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] regions, and settlements in [[eastern Croatia]] with significant Serb populations.<ref name=MarticICTY>{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}</ref> The areas were subsequently named [[SAO Krajina]] ([[Serb Autonomous Oblast]]) and, after declaring its intention to integrate with [[Serbia]], the [[Government of Croatia]] declared it to be a rebellion.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}</ref> By March 1991, the conflict escalated into the [[Croatian War of Independence]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}</ref> In June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared its independence]] as [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia disintegrated]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|26 June 1991}}</ref> A three-month moratorium followed,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|29 June 1991}}</ref> after which the decision came into effect on 8 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|8 October 1991}}</ref> The SAO Krajina, renamed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on 19 December, then initiated a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against Croatian civilians.<ref>{{harvnb|Klemen<U+010D>i<U+0107>|<U+017D>agar|2004|p=306}}</ref>

As the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) increasingly supported the SAO Krajina and the [[Croatian Police]] was unable to cope with the situation, the [[Croatian National Guard]] (ZNG) was formed in May 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272<U+2013>278}}</ref> The development of the [[military of Croatia]] was hampered by a UN [[arms embargo]] introduced in September,<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}</ref> while the [[Yugoslav campaign in Croatia|military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate]]&mdash;the [[Battle of Vukovar]] started on 26 August.<ref>{{harvnb|UNSCR|28 December 1994|loc=Section III}}</ref>

An already tense situation in the Lika region, following the 1 April [[Plitvice Lakes incident]], when the first fatalities of the Croatian War of Independence occurred,<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|pp=224<U+2013>227}}</ref> deteriorated further in June when Croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty through a [[Parliament of Croatia|parliamentary]] declaration. The deterioration reflected itself through a rise of violent incidents, setting up of unauthorized road checkpoints and occasional [[small arms]] fire. On 22 June, three policemen were abducted on the road between [[Gospi<U+0107>]] and SAO Krajina-controlled [[Gra<U+010D>ac]], and a series of attacks on the Croatian police occurred in various parts of Lika, including Gospi<U+0107>, on 27&ndash;28 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=227}}</ref> In July 1991, the JNA started to openly confront the Croatian police and the ZNG in Lika. On 1 July, [[Plitvi<U+010D>ka Jezera|Plitvice]] police station was surrounded by the JNA, and on 6 July, two ZNG troops were killed and another two wounded in a JNA ambush near Gospi<U+0107>. Further escalation of the fighting was seen at the Ljubovo pass on the Gospi<U+0107>&ndash;[[Korenica]] road, where the JNA and SAO Krajina troops fought and pushed the ZNG back on 28&ndash;29 July.<ref name=Marijan228>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=228}}</ref>

Ethnic violence continued to escalate when Serb paramilitaries abducted and killed five [[Croat]]ian civilians from [[Lovinac]] in southern Lika on 5 August,<ref>{{harvnb|Amnesty International|November 1991}}</ref> and a police checkpoint in [[<U+017D>uta Lokva]] was attacked.<ref>{{harvnb|Tatalovi<U+0107>|Jake<U+0161>evi<U+0107>|2008|p=138}}</ref> In early August, the JNA moved a company of the 4th Armoured Brigade, previously deployed to the Ljubovo pass, to Gospi<U+0107>, in order to reinforce its garrison in the town&mdash;the 236th Proletarian Motorized Brigade (a brigade in name only, the 236th was actually only a company-sized unit). The SAO Krajina troops attacked and captured the Plitvice police station on 30 August. As the successful capture of Plitvice became imminent, and as the ZNG pulled out of [[Li<U+010D>ki Osik]], located {{convert|8|km|abbr=off}} north of Gospi<U+0107>, on 31 August, the SAO Krajina and the JNA shifted their focus in Lika to Gospi<U+0107> itself,<ref name=Marijan229/> where Serbs comprised 38.4% of the total population of 12,000.<ref name=SD150900/>

==Order of battle==
The JNA forces consisted of the garrison of the ''Stanko Opsenica'' barracks in Gospi<U+0107>&mdash;70 officers and 200 soldiers,<ref name=SD160201>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|16 February 2001}}</ref> and four smaller JNA facilities in the town.<ref name=HV389>{{harvnb|Hrvatski Vojnik (b)|March 2012}}</ref> The garrison was supported by [[Serbian Guard (paramilitary)|Serbian Guard]] paramilitaries led by [[<U+0110>or<U+0111>e Bo<U+017E>ovi<U+0107>]]. The paramilitary unit deployed to Gospi<U+0107> from Serbia using JNA transportation,<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1999|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> fielding 128 troops, according to an interview with the commanding officer of [[Territorial Defense Forces (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defence]] in southern Lika in 1991.<ref>{{harvnb|Svedok|2009}}</ref> The JNA units based in Gospi<U+0107> following a reorganization in 1990 were the 236th Motorized Brigade and the 1st Brigade of the 35th Partisan Division, both subordinated to the [[Rijeka]] Corps. Prior to the reorganization, Gospi<U+0107> was garrisoned by the 10th Proletarian Infantry Regiment&mdash;a B-class unit required to maintain only 15% of wartime troop levels. In the reorganization process, the 10th Regiment was amalgamated with the 9th Proletarian Infantry Regiment to form the 236th Motorized Brigade.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=223}}</ref> The JNA garrison in Gospi<U+0107> was formally commanded by [[Colonel]] Petar <U+010C>avar, however effective command was taken over by his chief of staff, Yugoslav [[KOS (Yugoslavia)|Counterintelligence Service]] [[Major]] Relja Tomi<U+0107>.<ref name=SD150900/>

In early September, Croatian forces in Gospi<U+0107> comprised 427 troops, largely drawn from police forces based in Gospi<U+0107>, Rijeka and [[Zabok]], volunteers from Gospi<U+0107>, [[Zagreb]] and [[Senj]] as well as [[Croatian Defence Forces]] troops.<ref name=HV388>{{harvnb|Hrvatski Vojnik (a)|March 2012}}</ref> The ZNG force in Gospi<U+0107> consisted of the 118th Infantry Brigade. The brigade started to form around the ZNG 58th Independent Battalion on 14 August&mdash;but it would not be fully assembled until after October. In addition, the brigade failed to establish cooperation with the Karlovac Corps, to which it was formally subordinated. By mid-September, the brigade comprised two battalions&mdash;one of them comprising four companies and the other one three. The 118th Infantry Brigade was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Mirko Norac]],<ref>{{harvnb|VSRH|2 June 2004}}</ref> while the head of the Croatian police in Gospi<U+0107> was Ivan Dasovi<U+0107>.<ref name=HV388/>

==Timeline==
[[File:Map 5 - Croatia - Banija-Kordun-Lika Operations October 1991 - January 1992.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Front lines in Croatia in October&ndash;December 1991; the Battle of Gospi<U+0107> reflected itself in formation of a salient south of Gospi<U+0107>]]
The JNA and the Serb paramilitary force started artillery bombardment of Gospi<U+0107> from positions held in the village of Divoselo and the JNA Jasikovac Barracks on 29 August 1991. Intensity of the artillery attacks increased significantly towards mid-September, causing significant damage in Gospi<U+0107>. A SAO Krajina report of the attack estimated that more than 50% of structures in the city were damaged.<ref name=HV389/> At the outset of the battle, the JNA and the paramilitaries pushed the Croatian force out of the eastern part of Gospi<U+0107>.<ref name=HV388/>

On 5 September, Croatian forces captured JNA [[Major General]] Traj<U+010D>e Krstevski, along with three [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs) and 32 soldiers, when he attempted to reach JNA barracks that were isolated in the centre of the town. The next day, an exchange of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) was successfully negotiated. The Croatian commanders in Gospi<U+0107> declined a request that the APCs also be returned&mdash;contrary to the instructions of Croatian authorities in Zagreb. Following the capture of Krstevski, the JNA artillery bombardment was stepped up, averaging 1,100 artillery shells per day. Nonetheless the second week of the battle produced a stalemate, without any changes of lines of control.<ref name=SD150900>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|15 September 2000}}</ref>

The ZNG and Croatian police planned to [[Battle of the Barracks|cut power, water and communications to all JNA facilities]] in the government-controlled part of Croatia on 14 September.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=95}}</ref> In Gospi<U+0107>, this action was brought forward to 13 September, the same day that the ZNG captured a JNA storage facility. This provided the Croatian troops with 14,000 rifles and a substantial quantity of [[antitank weapon]]s.<ref name=SD150900/> The move provided sufficient arms and ordnance for Croatian forces to match the JNA in the town.<ref name=Marijan229>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=229}}</ref> The JNA barracks in Peru<U+0161>i<U+0107> and Kani<U+017E>a Barracks in Gospi<U+0107> were captured the following day. The bulk of the JNA garrison in Gospi<U+0107> surrendered on 18 September,<ref name=SD150900/> following three days of fighting for the Stanko Opsenica Barracks.<ref name=SD160201/> An infantry attack aiming to support the JNA garrison was successfully repelled by Croatian forces on 16 September in the Divoselo area,<ref name=SD070500>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|7 May 2000}}</ref> where Bo<U+017E>ovi<U+0107> was killed.<ref name=SD150900/> After the city centre became relatively secure, the Croatian forces extended their offensive, capturing the Jasikovac Barracks and relieving two Croatian-held pockets in villages of Ribnik and Bilaj by 20 September.<ref name=SD070500/> As the JNA surrendered, the Serb forces retreated from the eastern parts of Gospi<U+0107> to a line {{convert|8|km|abbr=off}} in front of [[Medak, Croatia|Medak]],<ref name=Marijan229/> as the Croatian forces completed mopping up in Gospi<U+0107> by 22 September.<ref name=BBII227/>

==Aftermath==
Croatia captured approximately 300 JNA officers and soldiers, who were taken to Rijeka after their capture.<ref name=SD150900/> They were later exchanged for Croatian POWs captured by the JNA in the Battle of Vukovar and elsewhere in Croatia.<ref name=SD160201/> A large quantity of small arms and ammunition was captured as well as seven tanks and twelve {{convert|120|mm|adj=on}} mortars.<ref>{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|October 2010}}</ref> After the battle, the artillery bombardment of Gospi<U+0107> continued from positions around Divoselo and Li<U+010D>ki <U+010C>itluk, approximately {{convert|5|to|8|km|abbr=off}} south of Gospi<U+0107>.<ref>{{harvnb|Glas Istre|1 March 2012}}</ref> Comparably small scale fighting in Lika continued until January 1992 as the belligerents sought to improve their positions on the ground, especially around Gospi<U+0107> and [[Oto<U+010D>ac]].<ref name=BBII227>{{harvnb|CIA|2002b|p=227}}</ref> A further Croatian advance to the south was stopped by the JNA and the SAO Krajina forces on 23 September defending a JNA storage depot in [[Sveti Rok]] using an infantry battalion and the [[Krajina Express]] [[armoured train]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|pp=229<U+2013>230}}</ref> The JNA fully secured the depot and captured Lovinac on 26 September. By the end of September, Croatian defensive positions around Oto<U+010D>ac were shored up, allowing minor attacks&mdash;largely in area of village of Drenov Klanac.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=234}}</ref> In late October and early December, fighting was intensified around Divoselo near Gospi<U+0107>, but no territory changed hands.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|pp=234<U+2013>235}}</ref> The intensity of artillery bombardment of Gospi<U+0107> peaked on 1 November 1991, when 3,500 artillery shells struck the town.<ref name=SD070500/> In December, the JNA Knin Corps proposed to the JNA General Staff to advance from Gra<U+010D>ac in an attempt to capture Gospi<U+0107> and Oto<U+010D>ac, but signing of the [[Sarajevo Agreement]] and ceasefire of 2 January 1992 largely halted further fighting,<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2006|p=235}}</ref> until the commencement of [[Operation Medak Pocket]] in September 1993.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=269}}</ref>

The continuing military confrontation in the region was accompanied by escalation of ethnic violence, culminating in war crimes against civilians committed by military authorities in Gospi<U+0107> and the SAO Krajina military in the area around Li<U+010D>ki Osik in October 1991. In Gospi<U+0107>, approximately 50 Serb civilians were taken from the town and killed in the surrounding fields. The individuals responsible for the event, later known as the [[Gospi<U+0107> massacre]], were prosecuted by Croatian judiciary. This resulted in the conviction, in 2003, of Norac and two other defendants to 12 years in prison.<ref>{{harvnb|BBC News|24 March 2003}}</ref> The killings in the Li<U+010D>ki Osik area, known as the [[<U+0160>iroka Kula massacre]], targeted 40 civilians, largely Croats but also Serbs suspected of supporting Croatia.<ref>{{harvnb|Nova TV|13 October 2011}}</ref> In 2011, a court in [[Belgrade]], Serbia, convicted four former SAO Krajina militiamen for killing of four Serbs and a Croat in <U+0160>iroka Kula.<ref>{{harvnb|Slobodna Dalmacija|14 March 2011}}</ref>
