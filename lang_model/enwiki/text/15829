'''''An American Crime''''' (also known as ''The Basement'') is a [[2007 in film|2007]] film based on the true story of the [[torture]] and [[murder]] of [[Sylvia Likens]] by [[Indianapolis]] housewife [[Gertrude Baniszewski]]. It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January to controversy amongst the critics, most of whom, nonetheless, lauded the daring performances of [[Catherine Keener]] and, especially, [[Ellen Page]].<ref name="broeske"/> The film will officially premiere on the US cable network, [[Showtime Network|Showtime]], in 2008.<ref>[http://ibc.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=294610 ''Showtime To Stream Emmy Screeners Online'']. BroadcastNewsroom.com. 31 January 2008.</ref>

==Plot==
"This," said Prosecutor Leroy New (portrayed by [[Bradley Whitford]]), "has been the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana." It was the first crime of [[child abuse]] that broke through reticence and denial to register with the public. [[Catherine Keener]] portrays Gertrude Baniszewski, the seemingly ordinary housewife who imprisons and tortures to death a teenaged girl, played by [[Ellen Page]], in the basement of her house.<ref name="broeske"/>

==Production notes==
Most of the cast were completely unaware of the real Likens murder until after they read the script, which was based largely on actual court transcripts from the case. Catherine Keener originally turned down the role of Gertrude Baniszewski, however after she couldn't get the story out of her head she met with director Tommy O'Haver and agreed to do the film.<ref name="broeske">Broeske, Ellen.

New York Times. 14 January 2007.</ref> Ellen Page was the only choice to play Sylvia Likens.

Another film inspired by the Likens tragedy, ''[[The Girl Next Door (novel)|The Girl Next Door]]'' (based on the acclaimed novel by [[Jack Ketchum]]) was also produced in 2007.
