The '''skeleton''' (from Greek <U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C4><U+03CC><U+03C2>, ''skeletos'' "dried body", "mummy"<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=skeleton|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=skeleton&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>) is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an [[organism]]. There are two different skeletal types: the [[exoskeleton]], which is the stable outer shell of an organism, and the [[endoskeleton]], which forms the support structure inside the body.

In a figurative sense, skeleton can refer to technology that supports a structure such as a building.

==Types of skeletons==
===Exoskeleton===
{{Main|Exoskeleton}}

[[Image:Hym-myrmicinae.gif|thumb|[[Exoskeleton]] of an [[ant]]]]
[[Exoskeleton]]s are external, and are found in many [[invertebrate]]s; they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body.  Some kinds of exoskeletons undergo periodic [[moult]]ing as the animal grows, as is the case in many [[arthropod]]s including [[insect]]s and [[crustacean]]s.
Exoskeletons are made of different materials including [[chitin]] (in arthropods), [[calcium]] compounds (in [[coral]]s and [[mollusk]]s) and [[silicate]] (for [[diatom]]s and [[radiolarian]]s.)

The exoskeleton of insects is not only a protection but also serves as a surface for muscle attachment, as a watertight protection against drying and as a sense organ to interact with their environments. The [[mollusc shell|shell]] of mollusks also performs all of the same functions, except that in most cases it does not contain sense organs.

An external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal, so on land, organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small. Somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater. The [[southern giant clam]], a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the Pacific Ocean, has a shell that is massive in both size and weight. ''[[Syrinx aruanus]]'' is a species of sea snail with a very large shell.

===Endoskeleton===

[[Endoskeleton]]s is the internal support structure of an [[animal]], composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] and are typical of many [[vertebrate]]s.  They vary in complexity such as functioning purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates.

====Sponges====
The skeleton of [[sponge]]s consists of microscopic [[calcareous]] or [[silicious]] [[Sponge spicule|spicule]]s. The [[demosponge]]s include 90% of all species of [[sponges]]. Their "skeletons" are made of [[spicules]] consisting of fibers of the protein [[spongin]], the mineral [[silica]], or both. Where spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar [[Hexactinellida|glass sponges]].<ref name=IZ>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 105<U+2013>106|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>

====Echinoderms====
The skeleton of the [[echinoderm]]s, which include, among other things, the [[starfish]], is composed of calcite and a small amount of [[magnesium oxide]]. It lies below the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in the [[mesoderm]] and is within cell clusters of frame-forming cells. This structure formed is porous and therefore firm and at the same time light. It coalesces into small [[calcareous]] ossicles (bony plates), which can grow in all directions and thus can replace the loss of a body part. Connected by joints, the individual skeletal parts can be moved by the muscles.

====Chordates====
In humans and generally in most vertebrates, the main skeletal component is referred to as [[bone]]. Another important component is [[cartilage]]. In mammals they are found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the [[shark]]s, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage.

Bones in addition to supporting the body also serve, at the cellular level, as calcium and phosphate storage.

=====Fish=====
The skeleton of the [[fish]] is either made of [[cartilage]] (cartilage fish) or bones ([[bony fishes]]). The main features of the fish, the fins, are bony fin rays and, except the [[caudal fin]], have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported only by the muscles. The ribs attach to the spine.

=====Birds=====
The bird skeleton is highly [[adaptation|adapted]] for [[flight]]. It is extremely lightweight, yet still strong enough to withstand the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of [[bone]]s into single [[ossification]]s, such as the [[pygostyle]]. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true [[jaw]], instead having evolved a [[beak]], which is far more lightweight.  The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an [[egg tooth]], which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.

=====Marine mammals=====
To facilitate movement of marine mammals in the water, the hind legs were either lost altogether, as in the whales and manatees, or united in a single tail fin e.g., pinniped seals.

===Hydrostatic skeleton===
The most simple form of skeleton is the [[hydrostatic skeleton]] found in many [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] organisms and soft-bodied animals.  The pressure of the fluid and action of the surrounding muscles are used to change an organism's shape and produce movement. This fluid filled cavity is known as the [[coelom]]. Invertebrates such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[jellyfish]] and [[earthworms]] have this form of a skeleton. The hydrostatic skeleton has some similarities to [[muscular hydrostat]]s.

===Cytoskeleton===
The [[cytoskeleton]] (gr. ''kytos'' = cell) is used to stabilize and preserve the form of the cells. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular motion (using structures such as [[flagella]], [[cilia]] and [[lamellipodia]]), and plays important roles in both intracellular transport (the movement of [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and [[organelle]]s, for example) and cellular division.

==Human==
{{Main|Human skeleton}}
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|180px|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The human skeleton consists of both fused and individual [[bone]]s supported and supplemented by [[ligament]]s, [[tendon]]s, [[muscle]]s and [[cartilage]]. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the [[human brain|brain]], [[human lung|lung]]s, [[human heart|heart]] and [[spinal cord]]. Although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly found in other bones, the teeth are considered bones and are a member of the skeletal system.
The biggest bone in the body is the [[femur]] in the upper leg, and the smallest is the [[stapes]] bone in the [[middle ear]]. In an adult, the skeleton comprises around 14% of the total body weight,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Allometric Relationship of Skeleton Weight to Body Weight in Teleost Fishes: A Preliminary Comparison with Birds and Mammals|author=William W. Reynolds and William J. Karlotski|journal=Copeia|year=1977|pages=160<U+2013>163}}</ref> and half of this weight is water.

Fused bones include those of the [[Human pelvis|pelvis]] and the [[Human skull|cranium]]. Not all bones are interconnected directly: There are three bones in each [[middle ear]] called the [[ossicles]] that articulate only with each other. The [[hyoid bone]], which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the [[tongue]], does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.

There are 206 bones in the adult human skeleton, although this number depends on whether the pelvic bones (the os innominatum on each side) are counted as one or three bones on each side (ilium, ischium, and pubis), whether the coccyx or tail bone is counted as one or four separate bones, and does not count the variable wormian bones between skull sutures. Similarly, the sacrum is usually counted as a single bone, rather than five fused vertebrae. There is also a variable number of small sesamoid bones, commonly found in tendons. The patella or kneecap on each side is an example of a larger sesamoid bone. The patellae are counted in the total, as they are constant. The number of bones varies between individuals and with age - newborn babies have over 270 bones<ref>{{cite web

The human skeleton takes 20 years before it is fully developed. In many animals, the skeleton bones contain [[Bone marrow|marrow]], which produces blood cells.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.human-body.org/skeletal.html |title=Human bones in the body?}}</ref>

Much of the human skeleton maintains the ancient segmental pattern present in all [[vertebrate]]s (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians) with basic units being repeated. This segmental pattern is particularly evident in the vertebral column and in the ribcage.

There exist several general differences between the male and female skeletons. The male skeleton, for example, is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. In the female skeleton, the bones of the skull are generally less angular. The female skeleton also has wider and shorter breastbone and slimmer wrists. There exist significant differences between the male and female pelvis which are related to the female's pregnancy and childbirth capabilities. The female pelvis is wider and shallower than the male pelvis. Female pelvises also have an enlarged pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet. The angle between the pubic bones is known to be sharper in males, which results in a more circular, narrower, and near heart-shaped pelvis.<ref>name="Balaban-61">{{cite book | title = The Handy Anatomy Answer Book | first = Naomi| last = Balaban| pages = 61 | year = 2008 | publisher = Visible Ink Press| isbn = 978-1-57859-190-9

==Bones and cartilage==
===Bone===
{{Main|Bone}}

Bones are rigid [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] that form part of the [[endoskeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s and store [[mineral]]s.  Bone tissue is a type of dense [[connective tissue]]. Because bones come in a variety of shapes and have a complex internal and external [[structure]] they are lightweight, yet strong and hard, in addition to fulfilling their many other [[Function (biology)|functions]]. One of the types of tissue that makes up bone is the mineralized [[osseous tissue]], also called bone tissue, that gives it rigidity and a [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb-like]] three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow|marrow]], [[endosteum]] and  [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]].  There are 206 bones in the adult human body<ref>{{cite book | title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton | author = Steele, D. Gentry; Claud A.

Appleton-Century | page = 31}}</ref>

===Cartilage===
{{Main|Cartilage}}

A commonly mistaken thought is that cartilage is only present in a human's nose area. However, when humans are first developing in utero, they have a cartilage precursor to their skeletal structure.  Much of this substance is then replaced by bone during the second and third trimester, after the flesh such as muscle has formed around it; forming the skeleton. Cartilage is a stiff and inflexible [[connective tissue]] found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between [[bone]]s, the [[rib cage]], the [[ear]], the [[nose]], the elbow, the knee, the ankle, the [[bronchial tubes]] and the [[intervertebral disc]]s. It is not as hard and rigid as [[bone]] but is stiffer and less flexible than [[muscle]].

Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of [[extracellular matrix]] composed of Type II [[collagen]] (except Fibrocartilage which also contains type I collagen) fibers, abundant [[ground substance]] rich in [[proteoglycan]], and [[elastin]] fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, [[elastic cartilage]], [[hyaline cartilage]] and [[fibrocartilage]], which differ in the relative amounts of these three main components.

Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by diffusion, helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.
