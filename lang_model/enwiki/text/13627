==History==

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] acquired the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Cheam in 1018, and it is thought that the church was founded soon after this date.  It was [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]], an earlier Archbishop of Canterbury.  A south [[aisle]] was added to the church in the 12th&nbsp;century.  In 1580 [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley]] inherited the nearby [[Nonsuch Palace]] through his marriage to [[Jane Lumley|Jane Fitzalan]], daughter of [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel]].  During the 1590s Lumley converted the church into a memorial chapel for himself and his two wives.<ref name=sutton>{{Citation | url = http://www.sutton.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1906| title = The Lumley Chapel| accessdate = 30&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[London Borough of Sutton]]}}</ref>  In the early 18th&nbsp;century the church consisted of a [[chancel]] with a south chapel, a [[nave]] with a south aisle, and a west tower.  Later in the century, possibly in 1746, the south aisle and the south wall of the nave were demolished and replaced by a wider nave.  At the same time a north aisle and a south porch were added.  In 1864 a new church, also dedicated to St Dunstan, was built to the north.  The older church was demolished, other than the east end of the chancel which was retained to contain the monuments and [[monumental brasses|brasses]] from the old church.<ref name=vch>{{citation |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43051#s5|title= Parishes: Cheam|accessdate= 30&nbsp;March 2011|editor1-last= Malden|editor1-first= H.
