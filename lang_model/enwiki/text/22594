He initially became a partner with the Woolworths by jointly opening a Reading, Pennsylvania, Woolworth & Knox store with them on [[September 20]] [[1884]], using his entire life savings.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  The Reading store's first several hours had no sales.   However, after the partners took a lunchtime walk, they returned at 1:30 to find the local factory workers had been let out at 1:00--with their paychecks. Sales were brisk, and the partners never looked back.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  His second store, in {{city-state|Newark|New Jersey}}, was short lived, but his partnership thrived nonetheless.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  The third venture, in {{city-state|Erie|Pennsylvania}}, enabled them to buy out the Newark lease.  He partnered with Frank to open the first Buffalo store, at 409 Main Street, on [[October 13]], [[1888]].   

By 1889, he was able to buy out his cousins.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  He maintained a collegial business relationship with his cousins after the buyout.  In fact, he bought Woolworth merchandise at wholesale and sometimes traded in competition.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  He formed another brief partnership with another friendly rival [[Earle Perry Charlton]] from 1889-1895, opening his Buffalo "S.H. Knox Co." 5 and 10 Cent Store in 1890.<ref name=WVM> </ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andrle.com/markers/mark062.htm|accessdate=March 31|accessyear=2007|title=Historic Markers, Monuments and Memorials of Buffalo, New York: S.H. Knox & Co.|author=F.W. Woolworth Co., Buffalo & Erie County Historical Society|publisher=Chris Andrle|date=2000}}</ref> Sources disagree on the chronology of later stores.  One source says that the second Buffalo store was opened at 549 William Street on [[June 20]], [[1891]].<ref name=DUNN/> Another says Knox opened his second store on [[December 18]], [[1893]], at 519 Main Street four days after the first store at 409 Main Street was destroyed in the Wonderland Building Fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freenet.buffalo.edu/bah/a/del/800/hist/index.html|accessdate=March 31|accessyear=2007|title=History - Grace Millard Knox House / Computer Task Group Building|author=|work=|date=2002}}</ref>  This store moved to 395 Main Street in 1895. He continued to build his S.H. Knox Co. 5 and 10 Cent Store empire. By the time of the 1911 incorporation of [[F. W. Woolworth Company]], Knox was the second largest of six store operators with 98 U.S. and 13 [[Canadian]] locations. In 1912, he received $12 million of the $65 million [[merger]] proceeds and was appointed Director and Senior Vice-Principal of the Corporation.<ref name=WVM> </ref>  Knox is remembered as the pioneering city center store operator. His {{city-state|Detroit|Michigan}} store was the first outside of the agricultural and small-market towns.<ref name=WVM> </ref> Many of the Woolworth friendly rivals emulated his plan.<ref name=WVM> </ref>

In 1913, he purchased Stephen Clement's interests in Marine National.<ref name=DUNN>{{cite web|url=http://freenet.buffalo.edu/bah/h/knox/bios/index.html|accessdate=March 31|accessyear=2007|title=Bios - Knox Family of Buffalo|author=Dunn, Edward T.|work=Buffalo's Delaware Avenue: Mansions and Families|date=2003}}</ref>   At his death, Seymour was Vice President of the Woolworth Co. and Chairman of the Board of the [[Marine Midland Bank|Marine Trust Co.]]  He was the first of three generations of the family to serve as Chairman.
