}}
"'''Bring Us Together'''" was a political slogan popularized after the election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Richard Nixon]] as [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[United States presidential election, 1968|in 1968]]. The text was derived from a sign carried by 13-year-old Vicki Lynne Cole at Nixon's rally in her home town of [[Deshler, Ohio]] during the campaign.

The sign, which read "Bring Us Together Again" was seen by Nixon or a member of his staff, and Nixon adopted the phrase "Bring Us Together" in his victory speech on November 6, 1968 as representing his administration's initial goal<U+2014>to reunify the bitterly divided country.  Cole came forward as the person who carried the sign, and was the subject of intense media attention.

Nixon invited Cole and her family to the [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon|inauguration]], and she appeared on a float in the Inaugural Parade.  The phrase "Bring Us Together" was used ironically by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] when Nixon proposed policies they considered divisive.  Cole refused to comment on Nixon's 1974 resignation, but later expressed her sympathy for him.  Nixon speechwriter [[William Safire]], who originally inserted the phrase in draft speeches written for Nixon, later expressed doubt that Cole's sign ever existed.
