'''SMS ''Prinz Heinrich''''' was a unique German [[armored cruiser]] built at the turn of the 20th century for the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial German Navy]], named after [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]'s younger brother [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862<U+2013>1929)|Prince Henry]]. ''Prinz Heinrich'' was built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]]. She was laid down in 1898 and completed in March 1902, at the cost of 16,588,000 [[German gold mark|Marks]]. ''Prinz Heinrich''{{'}}s design was a modification of the previous armored cruiser, {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1897|2}}, and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament [[admidships]], as opposed to ''F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck'', which spread the secondary armament along the length of the ship.

''Prinz Heinrich'' served with the German fleet for the majority of her career. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the ship participated in the operation against the British coast in December 1914, after which she was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea]]. Here, she operated against the Russian navy and was involved in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915, where she damaged a Russian destroyer. In 1916, the ship was withdrawn from active duty and was used in several secondary roles in Kiel, including acting as a floating office for naval staff. ''Prinz Heinrich'' was ultimately sold in 1920 and broken up for scrap later that year.

==Design==
The Second [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]] in Germany, passed in 1900, envisioned a force of fourteen [[armored cruiser]]s intended for overseas service in the German colonies. However, the German Navy required cruisers for operations with the fleet as well, and attempted to design ships that could fulfill both roles,<ref name=C142/> primarily due to budget constraints.<ref>Herwig, p. 27</ref> The first product of the 1900 Naval Law, ''Prinz Heinrich'', was an alteration of an earlier vessel, {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1897|2}}, equipped with fewer guns and thinner armor in a trade-off for higher speed and lower cost.<ref name=H28>Herwig, p. 28</ref> The design also set the precedent of concentrating the secondary battery amidships; ''F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck'' secondary guns had been spread along the length of the hull.<ref name=L255/> All subsequent armored cruisers were developments of ''Prinz Heinrich''.<ref name=H28/> ''Prinz Heinrich'' was laid down in 1898 at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Kiel]]. She was launched on 22 March 1900 and completed just under two years later, on 11 March 1902.<ref name=L255>Lyon, p. 255</ref> The new cruiser cost 16,588,000 [[German gold mark|Marks]].<ref name=G49>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 49</ref> 

===Dimensions and machinery===
''Prinz Heinrich'' was {{convert|124.9|m|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|126.5|m|abbr=on}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|19.6|m|abbr=on}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7.65|m|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|8.07|m|abbr=on}} aft. The ship displaced {{convert|8887|MT|sp=us}} as built, and {{convert|9806|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and incorporated thirteen [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that extended for 57&nbsp;percent of the length of the ship. The German navy considered the ship to be a good sea boat with gentle motion, though she suffered from severe roll. Her transverse [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|.731|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G49/> ''Prinz Heinrich'' was manned by a crew of 35 officers and 532 enlisted men. For the duration of her career as the second command flagship of the Cruiser Division, the standard crew was augmented by an additional nine officers and 44 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, a [[Launch (boat)|launch]], a [[pinnace]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name=G50/>

The ship was propelled by three vertical 4-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s; the center shaft drove a four-bladed screw {{convert|4.28|m|abbr=on}} in diameter while the two outer shafts drove {{convert|4.65|m|sp=us|adj=on}} wide four-bladed screws. Fourteen D<U+00FC>rr boilers, produced by ''D<U+00FC>sseldorf-Ratinger R<U+00F6>hrenkesselfabrik'', supplied steam to the engines at pressures up to {{convert|15|atm|lk=on}}. The propulsion system was rated at {{convert|15000|ihp|lk=on}} and gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=on}}, though on [[sea trial]]s, ''Prinz Heinrich''{{'}}s engines reached {{convert|15694|ihp|abbr=on}} but a top speed of only {{convert|19.9|kn|abbr=on}}. She was designed to carry {{convert|900|MT|abbr=on}} of coal, though additional storage allowed up to {{convert|1590|MT|abbr=on}}. This enabled a maximum range of {{convert|2290|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4580|nmi|abbr=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G49/>

===Armor===
''Prinz Heinrich'' was protected by [[Krupp armor]]. Her [[armor belt]] was {{convert|100|mm|sp=us}} thick in the central portion of the ship, which protected the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other vital areas of the cruiser. The belt was reduced to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} on either end of the main belt, and the bow and stern were unarmored. The entire length of the belt was backed by equal thicknesses of [[teak]] planks. The armored deck was {{convert|35|to|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was connected to the belt by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick sloped armor on the broadside.<ref name=G49/>

The forward [[conning tower]] had {{convert|150|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides and a {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof. The aft conning tower was much less thoroughly protected; it was covered by only {{convert|12|mm|abbr=on}} of steel plating. The main battery gun turrets had 150&nbsp;mm-thick sides and 30&nbsp;mm-thick roofs. The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had 100&nbsp;mm-thick armor, while the casemated weapons were protected by {{convert|70|mm|abbr=on}} gun shields. The casemates themselves were armored with 100&nbsp;mm worth of steel plating.<ref name=G49/>

===Armament===
''Prinz Heinrich'' was armed with a variety of weapons. Her primary armament consisted of two {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/40 quick-firing guns mounted in single turrets, one on either end of the [[superstructure]]. These guns were supplied with 75&nbsp;rounds each; they could depress to <U+2212>4<U+00B0> and elevate to 30<U+00B0>, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|16900|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G49/> The guns fired a {{convert|140|kg|abbr=on}} at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|835|m|abbr=on}} per second.<ref name=C140>Campbell, p. 140</ref> A secondary battery of ten {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/40 quick-firing guns rounded out her offensive armament. Six of these guns were mounted in [[amidships]] [[casemate]]s on either side of the vessel, and the remaining four were mounted in turrets in the ship's hull above the casemates. These guns were supplied with 120&nbsp;rounds each.<ref name=G4950/> The shells weighed {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and were fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}} per second. The guns could elevate to 25<U+00B0> for a maximum range of {{convert|13700|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=C140/>

The cruiser carried ten {{convert|8.8|cm|abbr=on}} SK L/30 quick-firing guns for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. Each of these guns was supplied with 250&nbsp;shells.<ref name=G49/> The shells weighed {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} and were fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|670|m|abbr=on}} per second. This enabled a maximum range of {{convert|7300|m|yd|abbr=on}} at an elevation of 20<U+00B0>.<ref name=C140/> The ship's gun armament was rounded out by four autocannons, though these were subsequently removed. The ship was also fitted with four {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes.<ref name=G49/> One was mounted on the stern in a swivel mount, one was mounted submerged in the bow, and one was placed submerged in the hull on either side abreast of the forward gun turret.<ref name=G4950/>

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Prinz Heinrich coaling.jpg|thumb|right|''Prinz Heinrich'' coaling from ''Hermann Sauber'']]
Following her commissioning in 1902, ''Prinz Heinrich'' served with the fleet. She was the [[flagship]] of the Cruiser Division, along with the [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}} and eight [[light cruiser]]s.<ref>''Our Contemporaries'', p. 355</ref> In January 1904, the cruiser and two passenger ships went to [[<U+00C5>lesund]] in the aftermath of a fire that destroyed the town. The ships carried supplies and medical stores to the port and assisted with the relief effort.<ref>''Survey of the World'', p. 176</ref> She was reassigned to the II Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet in 1905, after the arrival of the new armored cruiser {{SMS|Friedrich Carl||2}}. The II Subdivision also included the light cruisers {{SMS|Arcona||2}}, {{SMS|Hamburg||2}}, and {{SMS|Amazone||2}}, and was attached to the II Squadron of the Active Fleet. A second subdivision, composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the I Squadron.<ref>''Naval Notes - Germany'', p. 1319</ref> 

''Prinz Heinrich'' conducted a series of tests with the Miller apparatus, a device used by the [[US Navy]] to resupply warships at sea, in February 1907. The ship engaged in the experiments with the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] ''Hermann Sauber''; the first test took place on 17 February, and resulted in the crew being able to transfer {{convert|56|ST|abbr=on}} of coal per hour. On the 22nd, another test was undertaken, under harsh weather conditions, and similar results were reached.<ref>''New Apparatus for Coaling Warships'', pp. 65&ndash;66</ref> In 1914, ''Prinz Heinrich'' went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for modernization. The arrangement of the searchlights was modified, the superstructure deck bulwark was removed, and the masts were modernized. Following the improvements, she returned to the fleet.<ref name=G4950>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 49&ndash;50</ref> 

===World War I===
Following the wave of declarations of war between the major European powers at the end of July 1914, Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August.<ref>Herwig, p. 144</ref> ''Prinz Heinrich'' participated in the second major German offensive in the [[North Sea]], the [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|operation to bombard Hartlepool]] on 15&ndash;16 December, 1914. ''Prinz Heinrich'', along with {{SMS|Roon||2}} and a flotilla of torpedo boats, was assigned to the [[Vanguard (military formation)|van]] of the High Seas Fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]]. The main fleet was providing distant cover to Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s battlecruisers, which were conducting the bombardment.<ref>Scheer, p. 69</ref> During the night of the 15th, the German battle fleet of some twelve [[dreadnought]]s and eight [[pre-dreadnought]]s came to within {{convert|10|nmi|abbr=on}} of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival [[destroyer]] screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire [[Grand Fleet]]. Under orders from [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 31&ndash;33</ref> After the operation, it was determined that the twelve-year old ''Prinz Heinrich'' had no place in operations against the powerful British [[Grand Fleet]], and she was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea]] to operate against the Russian [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref name=L255/>

[[File:SMS Prinz Heinrich underway.jpg|thumb|left|''Prinz Heinrich'' steaming a high speed]]
Rear Admiral Hopman, the commander of the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic, conducted a major assault on Libau, in conjunction with an attempt by the German Army to seize the city.<ref>Halpern, p. 191</ref> The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of ''Prinz Heinrich'' and the armored cruisers {{SMS|Roon||2}} and {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert||2}}, the elderly [[Coastal defence ship|coast defense ship]] {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}, and the [[light cruiser]]s {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}, {{SMS|Thetis||2}}, and {{SMS|L<U+00FC>beck||2}}. They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The [[IV Scouting Group]] of the [[High Seas Fleet]] was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation.<ref>Halpern, pp. 191&ndash;192</ref> The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer {{SMS|V107||2}} struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault however, and took the city.<ref>Halpern, pp. 192&ndash;193</ref>

On 1 July, the minelayer {{SMS|Albatross||2}}, escorted by the cruisers ''Roon'', ''Augsburg'', and ''L<U+00FC>beck'' and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of [[Bogsk<U+00E4>r]]. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; ''Augsburg'', ''Albatross'', and three destroyers made for [[Rixh<U+00F6>ft]] while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. ''Augsburg'' and ''Albatross'' were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers.<ref>Halpern, pp. 194&ndash;195</ref> Commodore von Karpf, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower ''Albatross'' to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled ''Roon'' and ''L<U+00FC>beck''. ''Albatross'' was grounded off [[Gotland]] and ''Augsburg'' escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged ''Roon'' before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with ''Prinz Heinrich'' and ''Prinz Adalbert'' to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine {{HMS|E9||2}}, which scored a hit on ''Prinz Adalbert''. Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser.<ref>Halpern, p. 195</ref>

German naval forces in the Baltic were reinforced by elements of the [[High Seas Fleet]] during the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. The Germans sought to drive out the Russians in the Gulf of Riga and to lay defensive minefields that would prevent a Russian counterattack. The [[battleship]]s of the I Battle Squadron were the primary force, though ''Prinz Heinrich'' and the rest of the older vessels assigned to the Baltic fleet participated.<ref>Halpern, pp. 196&ndash;197</ref> On 10 August, ''Prinz Heinrich'' and ''Roon'' bombarded Russian defenses at [[Zerel]], on the southernmost tip of the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]] on the island of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]]. Several Russian destroyers were anchored off Zerel, and were caught unawares by the German bombardment. ''Prinz Heinrich'' and ''Roon'' damaged one of the destroyers during their attack.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> A combination of tenacious Russian defense and reports of British submarines in the area&mdash;proved by the torpedoing of the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} on 19 August&mdash;caused the German navy to break off the operation.<ref>Halpern, pp. 197&ndash;198</ref>

Beginning in 1916, ''Prinz Heinrich'' was removed from front-line service and used as a floating office in Kiel.<ref name=C142>Campbell, p. 142</ref> After she left active duty, the ship had her armament removed. She was subsequently used as a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tender#Etymology_2 tender], also in Kiel, for the remainder of her service career. She was stricken from the navy list on 25 January 1920 and sold later that year. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap at Audorf-Rendsburg.<ref name=G50>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 50</ref>
