{{Nihongo|'''''Tenjho Tenge'''''|<U+5929><U+4E0A><U+5929><U+4E0B>|Tenj<U+014D> Tenge|lit. "Heaven and Earth"}} is an ongoing [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] [[Mangaka|authored]] by [[Oh! great]]. The story primarily focuses on the members of the Juken Club and their opposition, the Executive Council, which is the ruling [[Students' union|student body]] of a high school that educates its students in the art of combat. As the story unfolds, both groups become increasingly involved with a ongoing battle that has been left unresolved for four hundred years.    

Tenjho Tenge was serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' published by [[Shueisha]]. It was adapted into a twenty-four episode anime series and aired on [[TV Asahi]] in Japan between [[April 1]] [[2004]] to [[September 16]] [[2004]]. A two-episode [[original video animation]] was also made and aired on [[March 16]] [[2005]]. Both versions of the series have been licensed for release in [[North America]] by two different companies. The manga has been licensed for publication by [[CMX (comics)|CMX]], which came under criticism by fans for editing its sexual content.<ref name="PW CR">{{cite web | first= Calvin  | last =Reid | title =Fans Ticked Over Manga Censorship | url =http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA509540.html| publisher =Publishers Weekly| date =[[2005]]-[[03-09]]| accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> The anime series has been licensed and is being released by [[Geneon|Geneon Entertainment (USA)]].

==Plot==
The plot begins with Souichiro Nagi and his friend Bob Makihara going to their first day of high school at Todo Academy. They had intended to rule the school by beating up anybody that got in their way, as they had done at their previous schools. They soon learn that Todo is no ordinary high school with ordinary students, but is a school that was founded to teach and integrate different fighting styles. Its students are skilled in the various arts of combat with some students possessing  [[Superpower (ability)|supernatural abilities]], such as [[pyrokinesis]], [[precognition]], and [[superhuman strength]]. After an altercation with the Executive Council, Souichiro and Bob join the only surviving club that opposes them, the Juken club. As the storyline develops, both groups find they are becoming increasingly involved in a long enduring conflict that was left unresolved from the [[Feudal Japan#Feudal Japan|Japanese Feudal era]] by some of the characters' ancestors.

''Tenjho Tenge'' is an [[organization story|organizational story]] that uses a character-driven plot. The story uses a [[dramatic structure]] in the form of [[story arc]]s, which is common for this [[Print media|medium]]. [[Oh! great]] often employs the [[literary technique]]s of [[flashback]] and [[back-story]] for long stretches of the storyline. These techniques are used to enforce the notion of [[determinism]], which is used throughout the story. Much of the combat used in ''Tenjho Tenge'' encompasses many philosophical and strategic concepts that is used in [[Japanese martial arts]], such as [[kiai]], [[aiki]], and [[maai]]. Both the manga and the anime follow the same storyline, though there are differences. One of these differences is that both the CMX manga and the anime toned down the sexual content and [[profanity]] of the original Japanese manga. Another disparity is that the hair color of some of the characters in the anime does not match their hair color depicted on the colored covers of the manga.

==Reception==
===Manga===
The ''Tenjho Tenge'' manga is described as an "...engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that's fairly dark and really violent at times".<ref name="CB1"> {{cite web|first = Chris |last =Beveridge| title =Tenjho Tenge Vol. #1|url =http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3775.php|publisher =Anime On DVD|date =[[2005]]-[[04-04]]| accessdate = 2007-12-16}}</ref> It is also known for its fighting, spontaneous nudity, and somewhat explicit sex scenes.<ref name ="hana"> {{cite web|first =Joy |last =| title =Tenjo Tenge |url = http://www.hanayume.net/hanami-gumi/manga/tenten.html|publisher =Hanami Gumi|date =[[2002]]-[[02-24]]| accessdate = 2007-12-16}}</ref> Even though its creator, [[Oh! great]], is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence,<ref name= "King">{{cite web|first =Patrick |last =King | title = Tenjho Tenge DVD 6: Round 6|url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tenjho-tenge/dvd-6|publisher = [[Anime News Network]]|date =[[2006]]-[[05-03]]| accessdate = 2007-12-17}}</ref> it is not done tactlessly. Oh! great uses sex as an important aspect of the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively.<ref name="PW KMC"/> He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength.

They used bright vibrant colors, solid backgrounds and plenty of visible detail with very little [[pixelation]] or jagged movement,<ref name="CB1"/> but at times used repeated character shots and animations.<ref name ="TD1"/> The animation done during the fight scenes is done in real time and is done as close to reality as possible while still bending, and often violating, the [[Physical law|laws of physics]].<ref name="ANNCS2">{{cite web|first = Carlo|last =Santos | title = Tenjho Tenge DVD 2: Round Two| url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/tenjho-tenge/dvd-2 |publisher =Anime News Network |date =[[2005]]-[[09-19]]| accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref>  The early fight scenes are thought to be the "...most intense seen in recent anime".<ref name ="KG"/> The quality of animation in these scenes does drop somewhat over time, but the action still looks better than the average fighting anime.<ref name="ANNCS1"/> Both the Japanese and English [[voice acting]] are considered to be good, but the English dub at times can be a little uneven.<ref name ="KG"/> The English dub on occasion has poor dialogue which causes it to lose much of the anime's sincerity.<ref name= "King"/> Overall, the anime is considered to be above average, but suffers from a lack of a good ending.<ref name "TD8"/>

===Music===
The original soundtrack for ''Tenjho Tenge'' is considered to be average. Most of the music does well with setting the tone within the anime, although some reviewers found it to be somewhat repetitive.<ref name="ANNCS3"/><ref>{{cite web|first =Rob |last =Lineberger| title =Tenjho Tenge: Round One|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/tenjhotengeround1.php|publisher =DVD Verdict|date =[[2005]]-[[06-15]]| accessdate = 2007-12-08}}</ref> Some found the drama tracks to be unsatisfactory, even though they were "well executed".<ref>{{cite web|first =Lauren  |last =Goodnight| title =Tenjho Tenge Great Disc. 1

==Controversy==
[[CMX (comics)|CMX]] came under a great deal criticism for their edits from readers. These edits included the length and breadth of the book, censoring out anything they felt was questionable for a teen audience such as covering up or removing [[nudity]], [[fanservice]], and [[sexual innuendo]] as well as a removal of an [[omake]] chapter.<ref>{{cite web | first= Mike  | last =Dungan | title =Tenjho Tenge Vol. #01 of 15* | url =http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=548 | publisher =Anime on DVD| date =[[2005]]-[[03-07]]| accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title =Tenjho Tenge Manga Heavily Edited | url =http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-03-03/tenjho-tenge-manga-heavily-edited | publisher =Anime News Network| date =[[2005]]-[[03-03]]| accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> This was done by a brand whose promotional material asserts that it offers "pure manga &mdash; 100% the way the original Japanese creators want you to see it."<ref name="PW CR"/> One of grievances made against CMX is that the edits are not only severe, but very noticeable.<ref >{{cite web | title =Tenjho Tenge v1 | url =http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/TenjhoTengev1II.htm| publisher =Manga Life|  accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> Fans also assert that Oh! great's use of sex in ''Tenjho Tenge'' is an important aspect of the storyline.<ref name="PW KMC"/> In response, protesters boycott the edited version and even started up their own website.<ref name="PW CR"/><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://digitalsin.bebopboard.net/tenten/|title=Tenjho Tenge manga boycotters website|accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Immediately following the controversy, Jake Tarbox, group editor of CMX, resigned from the company.
