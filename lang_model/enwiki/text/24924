The '''American Water Spaniel''', (often abbreviated to '''AWS'''), is a breed of [[spaniel]] which is one of a small number of breeds originating in the United States. Developed in the state of [[Wisconsin]] during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the [[Irish Water Spaniel|Irish]] and [[English Water Spaniel]]s. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeiffer, who set up the [[Breed club (dog)|breed club]] and [[Breed standard (dogs)|standard]], and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the [[United Kennel Club]], and later, the [[American Kennel Club]]. While they are the [[U.S. state dogs|state dog]] of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.

They are medium sized, and have a double layered coat, which comes in a variety of brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also become suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS may have been involved in the development of the [[Boykin Spaniel]].

==History==
[[image:1913 American Water Spaniels.jpg|thumb|left|American Water Spaniels, pictured in 1913]]
Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel originated in the areas along the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] and it's [[tributary]] the [[Wolf River (Fox River)|Wolf River]] during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could operate in both land and water for a variety of game whilst being compact enough to be transported in a small rowboat and able to stand the native cold water temperatures.<ref name="spiotta30">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 30</ref> Breeds involved in the creation of the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the [[English Water Spaniel]], [[Irish Water Spaniel]], [[Curly Coated Retriever]],<ref name="spiotta30"/> native Indian Dogs, the [[Poodle]],<ref name="smith21">[[#smith2002|Smith (2002)]]: p. 21</ref> and either the [[Sussex Spaniel]] or a type of field spaniel.<ref name="spiotta30"/>

The breed of dog created was known at the time as the American Brown Spaniel, which weighed around {{convert|18|kg|lb}}. It had a thick curly coat which protected it from the cold temperatures of the water and winter, and was used in hunting waterfowl, [[Ruffed Grouse]], [[Greater Prairie Chicken]] and a variety of fur&ndash;bearing animals.<ref name="spiotta31">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 31</ref>
[[Image:American water spaniel 02.jpg|thumb|right|A member of the breed at work in the water]]
Over the years however, the numbers of the breed began to dwindle due both to a reduction in the duck population through those valley areas, and because of a switch in [[hunting]] &ndash; from a means to gather food for survival to that of recreation. Additionally, following [[World War II]],<ref name=historyafield /> new types of dogs became available in Wisconsin such as [[setter]]s, [[Pointing breed|pointer]]s and other [[spaniel]]s, allowing additional specialization in hunting.<ref name="spiotta31"/> 

Dr. Fred J. Pfeiffer, from [[New London, Wisconsin]], set up Wolf River Kennels in order to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs.<ref name="spiotta31"/> He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20.<ref name="smith21"/> Part of a sales pitch that Pfeiffer mailed to prospective dog owners read, "The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man."<ref name="smith21"/>
[[image:American Water Spaniel 001.jpg|thumb|left|An American Water Spaniel's coat is water resistant]]
Due to Pfeiffer's work, the breed was recognized by the [[United Kennel Club]] (UKC) as the American Water Spaniel in 1920, and by the [[Field Dog Stud Book]] in 1938. Dr. Pfeiffer's own dog, named "Curly Pfeiffer" was the first American Water Spaniel to be registered with UKC.<ref name="spiotta31"/> John Scofield of [[Missouri]] and Thomas Brogdan of [[Rush Lake, Wisconsin]] worked together with the American Water Spaniel Club (AWSC), gaining the breed recognition with the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) in 1940.<ref name=historyafield>{{cite book|last=Willging|first=Robert C.|title=History Afield: Stories from the Golden Age of Wisconsin Sporting Life|year=2011|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=9780870204296|pages=94&ndash;95|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wWm2UqmBff8C&pg=PA95&dq=%22American+Water+Spaniel%22#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Water%20Spaniel%22&f=false}}</ref> Prior to recognition by the AKC, the breed had not been shown in the [[Conformation show|show]] ring before.<ref name=akcdyk>{{cite web|title=American Water Spaniel Did You Know?|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/american_water_spaniel/did_you_know.cfm|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref>

The breed has links to the [[Boykin Spaniel]], and is thought to have been the main breed used to develop the Boykin. The differences between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin, called "Dumpy", who was found on the streets of [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], was actually an American Water Spaniel who had been misplaced in transit. However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account.<ref name="smith21"/>

The breed was made the [[U.S. state dogs|state dog]] of Wisconsin in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/wisconsin_state_symbols.html|title=State Symbols of Wisconsin|publisher=Wisconsin.gov|accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref> The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were registered with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs being in existence mostly around the [[Midwestern United States]],<ref name=spiotta32 /> in particular in Wisconsin, [[Minnesota]] and [[Michigan]].<ref name=gundogroebuck /> In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the USA, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th.<ref name=dogregakc>{{cite web|title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref> The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC hunt tests or field trials, but may compete in retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States.<ref name="spiotta32"/> The American Water Spaniel Association was set up in 1993 for breeders seeking spaniel classification.<ref name="spiotta33">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 33</ref> In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.<ref name=historyafield />

==Appearance==
[[image:American Water Spaniel 3.JPG|right|thumb|An AWS with a marcel pattern coat]]
The limited popularity of the American Water Spaniel restricted development, resulting in the breed being relatively unchanged since its origins in the 19th century. They are a medium sized dog, with a curly liver, brown, or chocolate colored coat.<ref name="spiotta30"/> The average height at the [[withers]] for the breed is {{convert|15|-|18|in|cm}}, whilst weighing around {{convert|25|-|45|lb|kg}}. They have similar features to the [[Irish Water Spaniel]], but the Irish breed is larger at between {{convert|21|-|24|in|cm}} and weighing {{convert|55|-|65|lb|kg}}.<ref name="spiotta33"/> The coat of the American Water Spaniel can fall in two different patterns, either tightly curled or in the "marcel pattern" where the fur falls in waves. Working and show lines have not diverged as with some other breeds of spaniel, and both appear the same,<ref name="spiotta33"/> with show dogs of this breed being rare.<ref name="smith107">[[#smith2002|Smith (2002)]]: p. 107</ref>

The coat has a course outside layer which keeps water away and protects the dog from foliage such as briers. The inside layer provides insulation to keep the dog warm. The coat has an oily feel to it, which gives off a "doggy smell".<ref name="spiotta37">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 37</ref> The breed standard specifies color of the eyes should harmonize with the color of the coat, and should never be yellow. The skull is broad, and carries long, wide ears.<ref name="spiotta30"/> The tail is not typically [[Docking (dog)|docked]].<ref name=gundogroebuck>{{cite book|last=Roebuck|first=Kenneth C.|title=Gun-Dog Training Spaniels and Retrievers|year=1982|publisher=Stackpole|location=Harrisburg, PA|isbn=9780811707787|page=38|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2YgyiwK7D34C&pg=PA38&dq=%22American+Water+Spaniel%22#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Water%20Spaniel%22&f=false}}</ref>

==Temperament==
[[Image:American water spaniel 01.jpg|thumb|upright|An AWS with a duck]]
In the field, the AWS is less exhuberant than the [[English Springer Spaniel]], but is as skilled in retrieval as [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] or [[Golden Retriever]]. It is versatile regardless of the type of terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance.<ref name="spiotta32">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 32</ref> The breed is also good at [[Dog agility|agility]] and [[flyball]], with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.<ref name=spiotta37 />

Members of the breed enjoy being the center of attention, and can be quite vocal at times. It is a one family dog, and will often bond with one particular individual. For many years the breed was "pack bred", where they were allowed to live in a group. Since these times, breeders have been working to breed even tempered dogs that are suitable for both hunting and family life.<ref name="spiotta34">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 34</ref>

The AWS has a mind of its own at times and reaches peak performance with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills.<ref name=informationawsfa>{{cite web|title=A Little Information About the AWS|url=http://www.awsfa.org/Club%20Info/AWS%20History.htm|publisher=The American Water Spaniel Field Association, Inc.|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref> However, members of the breed can attempt to take an [[alpha dog]] position, and may also have issues with food possessiveness.<ref name="smith106"/> They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.<ref name="spiotta35">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 35</ref>

==Health==
Pack breeding early in its development led to a level of genetic variation, so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS. The breed however is known to suffer from eye issues including [[cataract]]s and [[progressive retinal atrophy]].<ref name="spiotta30"/> Inheritance is suspected in both conditions, with the average age of cataract onset at under a year old.<ref name=breedpredisp/> 

Additional concerns are [[hypothyroidism]], allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness.<ref name="spiotta30">[[#spiotta1999|Spiotta-DiMare (1999)]]: p. 38</ref> The hair loss occurs at around six months of age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs.<ref name=breedpredisp>{{cite book|last=Gough|first=Alex|title=Breed Predispositions to Disease in Dogs and Cats|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Oxford, UK ; Ames, Iowa, USA|isbn=9781405107488|pages=1980&ndash;1981|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pab4ua8HaRMC&pg=PA1980&dq=%22American+Water+Spaniel%22#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Water%20Spaniel%22&f=false}}</ref> [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]] is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals]] over a twenty five year period between 1974 and 1999. This was one of the lower results of the sporting breeds, with [[Greyhound]]s coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related [[Boykin Spaniel]] coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of [[elbow dysplasia]] found.<ref name="smith52">[[#smith2002|Smith (2002)]]: p. 52</ref> The breed has an average life span of 10&ndash;13 years.<ref name="smith106">[[#smith2002|Smith (2002)]]: p. 106</ref><ref name=howell>{{cite book|last=Palika|first=Liz|title=The Howell Book of Dogs: The Definitive Reference to 300 Breeds and Varieties|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J|isbn=9780470009215|page=131|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9z_n9mDY2tcC&pg=PA131&dq=%22American+Water+Spaniel%22#v=onepage&q=%22American%20Water%20Spaniel%22&f=false}}</ref>
