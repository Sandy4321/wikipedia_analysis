In modern [[physics]], the '''photon''' is the [[elementary particle]] responsible for [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic phenomena]].  It mediates [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]s and is the fundamental constituent of all forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], that is, [[light]].  The photon has zero [[rest mass]] and, in empty space, travels at the [[speed of light]]; in the presence of matter, it can be slowed or even [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]], transferring [[energy]] and [[momentum]] proportional to its [[frequency]].  The photon has both wave and particle properties; it exhibits [[wave-particle duality]].

The modern concept of the photon was developed gradually (1905<U+2013>17) by Albert Einstein<ref name="Einstein1905">{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | year = 1905 | title = <U+00DC>ber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt (trans.

In particular, the photon model captured the frequency dependence of light's energy and [[momentum]], and explained the ability of [[matter]] and [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] to be in [[thermal equilibrium]].  Other physicists sought to explain these anomalous observations by ''semiclassical models'', in which light is still described by [[Maxwell's equations]] but the material objects that emit and absorb light are quantized.  Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], experiments eventually proved Einstein's hypothesis that ''light itself'' is particulate.

The photon concept has led to many advances in experimental and theoretical physics, such as [[laser]]s, [[Bose<U+2013>Einstein condensation]], [[quantum field theory]], and the [[probability amplitude|probabilistic interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.  According to the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], photons are responsible for producing all [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, and are themselves the product of requiring that physical laws have a certain [[symmetry]] at every point in [[spacetime]].  The intrinsic properties of photons &mdash; such as [[electric charge|charge]], [[invariant mass|mass]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] &mdash; are determined by the properties of this [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]].  Photons have many applications in technology such as [[photochemistry]], [[charge-coupled device|CCD cameras]], [[single photon emission computed tomography|medical imaging]], [[two-photon excitation microscopy|high-resolution microscopy]] and [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer|measurements of molecular distances]].  Recently, photons have been studied as elements of [[quantum computer]]s and for sophisticated applications in [[optical communication]] such as [[quantum cryptography]].

==Nomenclature==

The photon was originally called a "light quantum" (''das Lichtquant'') by its inventor, [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name="Einstein1905" />  The modern name "photon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek word]] for light, ''{{polytonic|<U+03C6><U+1FF6><U+03C2>}}'', and was coined in 1926 by the physical chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who published a speculative theory<ref name="Lewis1926">{{cite journal | last = Lewis | first = GN | authorlink = Gilbert N. Lewis | title = The conservation of photons | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | year = 1926 | volume = 118 | pages = 874&mdash;875}}</ref> in which photons were "uncreatable and indestructible".  Although Lewis' theory was never accepted &mdash; being contradicted by many experiments &mdash; his new name, ''photon'', was adopted immediately by most physicists.

In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol <math>\gamma \!</math>, the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[gamma]].  In [[chemistry]] and [[optical engineering]], photons are usually symbolized by <math>h \nu \!</math>, the energy of a photon, where <math>h \!</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]]  <math>\nu \!</math> ([[Nu (letter)|nu]]) is the photon's [[frequency]].  Much less commonly, the photon can be symbolized by ''hf'', where its frequency is denoted by ''f''.

==Physical properties of the photon==

{{See also|Special relativity}}

:''Some readers may wish to skip this section on first reading.  The definitions and descriptions are clearly written, and necessary for a quantitative understanding of the photon.  However, their interpretation may require some prior knowledge of physics.''

The photon is [[invariant mass|massless]],<ref name="rel_mass">The [[invariant mass|intrinsic or "invariant" mass]] of the photon is believed to be exactly zero, based on experiment and theoretical considerations, as described above.  This is the standard definition of "mass" among physicists.  However, some popularizations of physics have ascribed to the photon a [[relativistic mass]], defined as ''E''/''c''<sup>2</sup>, where  ''E'' represents the photon's energy.

See [[mass in special relativity]] for a discussion of the relationship between invariant mass and relativistic mass.</ref> has no [[electric charge]]<ref name="chargeless">{{cite journal | last = Cocconi | first = G | year = 1992 | title = [http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&id=AJPIAS000060000008000750000001&idtype=cvips&prog=normal  Upper Limits on the Electric Charge of the Photon] | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 60 | pages = 750&mdash;751}}</ref> and does not decay spontaneously in empty space.  A photon has two possible [[polarization]] states and is described by three continuous parameters: the components of its [[wave vector]], which determine its wavelength <math>\lambda \!</math> and its direction of propagation.  Photons are emitted in many natural processes, e.g., when a charge is accelerated, when an [[atom]] or a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] jumps from a higher to lower [[energy level]], or when [[electron-positron annihilation|a particle and its antiparticle are annihilated]].  Photons are absorbed in the [[T-symmetry|time-reversed]] processes, e.g., in the [[pair production|production of particle<U+2013>antiparticle pairs]] or in atomic or nuclear transitions to a higher energy level.

Since the photon is massless, the photon moves at <math>c \!</math> (the [[speed of light]] in empty space) and its [[energy]] <math>E \!</math> and [[momentum]] <math>\mathbf{p}</math> are related by <math>E = c \, p \!</math>, where <math>p \!</math> is the magnitude of the momentum.  For comparison, the corresponding equation for particles with an [[invariant mass]] <math>m \!</math> would be <math>E^{2} = c^{2} p^{2} + m^{2} c^{4} \!</math>, as shown in [[special relativity]].

The energy and momentum of a photon depend only on its [[frequency]] <math>\nu \!</math> or, equivalently, its [[wavelength]] <math>\lambda \!</math>

:<math>
E = \hbar\omega = h\nu \!
</math>

:<math>\mathbf{p} = \hbar\mathbf{k}</math>

and consequently the magnitude of the momentum is

:<math>
p = \hbar k = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{h\nu}{c}
</math>

where <math>\hbar \equiv h/2\pi \!</math> (known as [[Planck's constant|Dirac's constant or Planck's reduced constant]]); <math>\mathbf{k}</math> is the [[wave vector]] (with the wave number <math>k \equiv 2\pi/\lambda \!</math> as its magnitude) and <math>\omega \equiv 2\pi\nu \!</math> is the [[angular frequency]]. Notice that <math>\mathbf{k}</math> points in the direction of the photon's propagation. The photon also carries [[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]] that does not depend on its frequency.  The magnitude of its spin is <math>\sqrt{2} \hbar </math> and the component measured along its direction of motion, its [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], must be <math>\pm\hbar</math>.  These two possible helicities correspond to the two possible [[circular polarization]] states of the photon (right-handed and left-handed). 

To illustrate the significance of these formulae, the [[electron-positron annihilation|annihilation of a particle with its antiparticle]] must result in the creation of at least ''two'' photons for the following reason. In the [[center of mass]] [[frame of reference|frame]], the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum.  Hence, [[momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum.  The energy of the two photons &mdash; or, equivalently, their frequency &mdash; may be determined from [[conservation law|conservation of four-momentum]].  The reverse process, [[pair production]], is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as [[gamma ray]]s lose energy while passing through matter.

The classical formulae for the energy and momentum of [[electromagnetic radiation]] can be re-expressed in terms of photon events.  For example, the [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in [[momentum]] per unit time.

==Historical development of the photon concept==

{{main|Light}}

[[Image:Young Diffraction.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Thomas Young]]'s [[double-slit experiment]] in 1805 showed that light could act as a [[wave]], helping to defeat early [[elementary particle|particle]] theories of light.]]

In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being made up of particles.  Since particle models cannot easily account for the [[refraction]], [[diffraction]] and [[birefringence]] of light, wave theories of light were proposed by [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]] (1637),<ref>{{cite book | last = Descartes | first = R | authorlink = Ren<U+00E9> Descartes | title = Discours de la m<U+00E9>thode ([[Discourse on Method]]) | year = 1637}}</ref> [[Robert Hooke]] (1665),<ref>{{cite book | last = Hooke | first = R | authorlink = Robert Hooke | year = 1665 | title = [http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/HistSciTech.HookeMicro ''Micrographia: or some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses with observations and inquiries thereupon...'']}}</ref> and [[Christian Huygens]] (1678);<ref>{{cite book | last = Huygens | first = C | authorlink = Christian Huygens | year = 1678 | title = Traite de la lumiere ([http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14725 Treatise on Light], translated into English by Silvanus P. Thompson, Project Gutenberg etext)}}</ref> however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due to the influence of [[Isaac Newton]].<ref name="Newton1730">{{cite book | last = Newton | first = I | authorlink = Isaac Newton | year = 1730 | title = Opticks | edition=4th edition | pages=Book II, Part III, Propositions XII-XX; Queries 25-29 | publisher = Dover Publications | id=ISBN 0-486-60205-2}}</ref>  In the early nineteenth century, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|August Fresnel]] clearly demonstrated the [[interference]] and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted.<ref>{{cite book | last = Buchwald | first = Jed Z. | year = 1989 | title = The Rise of the Wave Theory of Light: Optical Theory and Experiment in the Early Nineteenth Century | publisher = University of Chicago Press | id=ISBN 0226078868}}</ref>  In 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Maxwell's equations|prediction]]<ref name="maxwell">{{cite journal | last = Maxwell | first = JC | authorlink = James Clerk Maxwell | year = 1865 | title = [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]] | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 155 | pages = 459&mdash;512}}  This article followed a  presentation by Maxwell on 8 December 1864 to the Royal Society.</ref> that light was an electromagnetic wave &mdash; which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s detection of [[radio|radio waves]]<ref name="hertz">{{cite journal | last = Hertz | first = H | authorlink = Heinrich Hertz | year = 1888 | title = <U+00DC>ber Strahlen elektrischer Kraft | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin) | volume = 1888 | pages = 1297&mdash;1307}}</ref> &mdash; seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.

[[Image:Light-wave.png|thumb|340px|right|In 1900, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[Maxwell's equations|theoretical model of light]] as oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s seemed complete.  However, several observations could not be explained by any wave model of [[electromagnetic radiation]], leading to the idea that light-energy was packaged into ''quanta'' described by E=h<U+03BD>.  Later experiments showed that these light-quanta also carry momentum and, thus, could be considered [[elementary particle|particles]]: the ''photon'' concept was born, leading to a deeper understanding of the electric and magnetic fields themselves.]]

The [[electromagnetic wave equation|Maxwell wave theory]], however, does not account for ''all'' properties of light.  The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its [[intensity]], not on its [[frequency]]; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity.  For example, [[photochemistry|some chemical reactions]] can be provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of lower frequency, no matter how intense, is incapable of exciting the reaction.  Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it (the [[photoelectric effect]]); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its intensity.  

At the same time, investigations of [[blackbody radiation]] carried out over four decades (1860<U+2013>1900) by various researchers<ref name="Wien1911">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1911/wien-lecture.html | title = Wilhelm Wien Nobel Lecture}} Delivered [[11 December]] [[1911]].</ref> culminated in [[Max Planck]]'s [[Planck's constant|hypothesis]]<ref name="Planck1901">{{cite journal | last = Planck | first = M | authorlink = Max Planck | year = 1901 | title = <U+00DC>ber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 4 | pages = 553&mdash;563}} {{de icon}}</ref><ref name="Planck1918">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-lecture.html | title = Max Planck's Nobel Lecture}} Delivered [[2 June]] [[1920]].</ref> that the energy of ''any'' system that absorbs or emits electromagnetic radiation of frequency <math>\nu \!</math> is an integer multiple of an energy quantum <math>E = h\nu \!</math>.  As shown by [[Albert Einstein]],<ref name="Einstein1905" /><ref name="Einstein1909" /> some form of energy quantization ''must'' be assumed to account for the thermal equilibrium observed between matter and [[electromagnetic radiation]].

Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation.  In 1905, Einstein was the first to propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself.<ref name="Einstein1905" />  Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the ''energy'' of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space.<ref name="Einstein1905" />  In 1909<ref name="Einstein1909" /> and 1916,<ref name="Einstein1916b" /> Einstein showed that, if [[Planck's law of black-body radiation]] is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry [[momentum]] <math>p=\frac{h}{\lambda}</math>, making them full-fledged [[elementary particle|particles]].  This photon momentum was observed experimentally<ref name="Compton1923">{{cite journal | last = Compton | first = A | authorlink = Arthur Compton | year = 1923 | title = A Quantum Theory of the Scattering of X-rays by Light Elements | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 21 | pages = 483&mdash;502}}</ref> by [[Arthur Compton]], for which he received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1927.  The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature?  The answer to this question occupied [[Albert Einstein]] for the rest of his life, and was solved in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and its successor, the [[Standard Model]].

==Early objections to the photon hypothesis==

[[Image:Bohr_model_Balmer_32.png|thumb|250px|left|Up to 1923, most physicists were reluctant to accept that electromagnetic radiation itself was quantized.  Instead, they tried to account for photon behavior by quantizing ''matter'', as in the [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] (shown here).   Although all semiclassical models have been disproven by experiment, these early atomic models led to [[quantum mechanics]].]]

Einstein's 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways within the first two decades of the 20th century, as recounted in [[Robert Millikan]]'s Nobel lecture.<ref name="Millikan1923">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/millikan-lecture.html | title = Robert A. Millikan's Nobel Lecture}} Delivered [[23 May]] [[1924]].</ref>  However, before [[Compton scattering|Compton's experiment]]<ref name="Compton1923" /> showing that photons carried [[momentum]] proportional to their [[frequency]] (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that [[electromagnetic radiation]] itself might be particulate.  (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of [[Wilhelm Wien|Wien]],<ref name="Wien1911" /> [[Max Planck|Planck]]<ref name="Planck1918" /> and Millikan.<ref name="Millikan1923" />)  This reluctance is understandable, given the success and plausibility of Maxwell's electromagnetic wave model of light.  Therefore, most physicists assumed rather that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits radiation.  [[Niels Bohr]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and others developed atomic models with discrete energy levels that could account qualitatively for the sharp spectral lines and energy quantization observed in the emission and absorption of light by atoms; their models agreed excellently with the spectrum of hydrogen, but not with those of other atoms.  It was only the Compton scattering of a photon by a ''free'' electron (which can have no energy levels, since it has no internal structure) that convinced most physicists that light itself was quantized.

Even after Compton's experiment, Bohr, [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hendrik Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|John Slater]] made one last attempt to preserve the Maxwellian continuous electromagnetic field model of light, the so-called BKS model.<ref name="Bohr1924">{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = N | authorlink = Niels Bohr | coauthors = [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Kramers HA]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater JC]] | year = 1924 | title = The Quantum Theory of Radiation | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 47 | pages = 785&mdash;802}} Also ''[[Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik]]'', '''24''', 69 (1924).</ref>  To account for the then-available data, two drastic hypotheses had to be made:

* ''Energy and momentum are conserved only on the average in interactions between matter and radiation, not in elementary processes such as absorption and emission.''  This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (jump between energy states) with the continuously release of energy into radiation.

* ''Causality is abandoned.''  For example, [[spontaneous emission]]s are merely [[stimulated emission|emissions induced]] by a "virtual" electromagnetic field.

However, refined Compton experiments showed that energy-momentum is conserved extraordinarily well in elementary processes; and also that the jolting of the electron and the generation of a new photon in [[Compton scattering]] obey causality to within 10 [[picosecond|ps]].  Accordingly, Bohr and his co-workers gave their model "as honorable a funeral as possible".<ref name="Pais1982">{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1982 | title = Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 364&mdash;388, 402&mdash;415}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the BKS model inspired [[Werner Heisenberg]] in his development<ref name="Heisenberg1932">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-lecture.html Heisenberg Nobel lecture], delivered [[11 December]] [[1933]].</ref> of [[quantum mechanics]].

A few physicists persisted<ref name="Mandel1976">{{cite journal | last = Mandel | first = L | authorlink = Leonard Mandel | year = 1976 | title = The case for and against semiclassical radiation theory | journal = Progress in Optics | editor = E. Wolf, ed. | publisher = North-Holland | volume = XIII | pages = 27&ndash;69}}</ref> in developing semiclassical models in which [[electromagnetic radiation]] is not quantized, but matter obeys the laws of [[quantum mechanics]].  Although the evidence for photons from chemical and physical experiments was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as ''absolutely'' definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, a sufficiently complicated theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence.  Nevertheless, ''all'' semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970's and 1980's by elegant photon-correlation experiments.<ref name="exp_proof">These experiments produce results that cannot be explained by any classical theory of light, since they involve anticorrelations that result from the [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement process]].  In 1974, the first such experiment was carried out by Clauser, who reported a violation of a classical [[Cauchy<U+2013>Schwarz inequality]].  In 1977, Kimble ''et al.'' demonstrated a analogous anti-bunching effect of photons interacting with a beam splitter; this approach was simplified and sources of error eliminated in the photon-anticorrelation experiment of Grangier ''et al.'' (1986). This work is reviewed and simplified further in Thorn ''et al.'' (2004).  (These references are listed below under '''Additional references'''.)</ref>  Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.

==Wave<U+2013>particle duality and uncertainty principles==

{{See also|Wave<U+2013>particle duality|Squeezed coherent state|Uncertainty principle}}

Photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, and their dual wave<U+2013>particle nature can be difficult to visualize.  The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as [[diffraction]] and [[interference]] on the length scale of its wavelength.  For example, a single photon passing through a [[double-slit experiment]] lands on the screen with a [[probability distribution]] given by its interference pattern determined by [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref name="Taylor1909">{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = GI | authorlink = Geoffrey Ingram Taylor | year = 1909 | title = Interference fringes with feeble light | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 15 | pages = 114&mdash;115}}</ref>  However, experiments confirm that the photon is ''not'' a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a [[beam splitter]].  Rather, the photon seems like a point-like particle, since it is absorbed or emitted ''as a whole'' by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (<U+2248>10<sup><U+2013>15</sup> m across) or even the point-like [[electron]].  Nevertheless, the photon is ''not'' a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the [[electromagnetic field]], as conceived by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above.<ref name="exp_proof" />  According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local [[gauge symmetry]] and the laws of [[quantum field theory]] (see the [[Photon#Second quantization|Second quantization]] and [[Photon#The photon as a gauge boson|Gauge boson]] sections below).

[[Image:Heisenberg_gamma_ray_microscope.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[thought experiment]] for locating an [[electron]] (shown in blue) with a high-resolution gamma-ray microscope.  The incoming [[gamma ray]] (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's [[angular aperture|aperture angle]] <U+03B8>.  The scattered gamma ray is shown in red.  [[Optics|Classical optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an  uncertainty <U+0394>x that depends on <U+03B8> and the [[wavelength]] <U+03BB> of the incoming light.]]

The [[quantum mechanics]] of material particles features an [[uncertainty principle]] that forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle in the same direction.  An analogous principle for photons forbids the simultaneous measurement of the number <math>n</math> of photons (see [[Fock state]] and the [[Photon#Second quantization|Second quantization]] section below) in an electromagnetic wave and the phase <math>\phi</math> of that wave

:<math>
\Delta n \Delta \phi > 1
</math>

See [[coherent state]] and [[squeezed coherent state]] for more details.  

Remarkably, the quantization of light into photons and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum can be seen as necessary consequences of the [[quantum mechanics]] of charged, ''material'' particles such as the electron.    An elegant illustration is [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[thought experiment]] for locating an electron with an ideal microscope.<ref name="Heisenberg1927">{{cite journal | last = Heisenberg | first = W | authorlink = Werner Heisenberg | year = 1927 | title = <U+00DC>ber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik | journal = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik | volume = 43 | pages = 172&ndash;198}}</ref>  The position of the electron can be determined to within the [[angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope, which is given by a formula from classical [[optics]]

:<math>
\Delta x \sim \frac{\lambda}{\sin \theta}
</math>

where <math>\theta</math> is the [[angular aperture|aperture angle]] of the microscope. Thus, the position uncertainty <math>\Delta x</math> can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the wavelength.  The momentum of the electron is uncertain, since it received a "kick" <math>\Delta p</math> from the light scattering from it into the microscope.  If light were ''not'' quantized into photons, the uncertainty <math>\Delta p</math> could be made arbitrarily small by reducing the light's intensity.  In that case, since the wavelength and intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating the [[uncertainty principle]].  By contrast, Einstein's formula for photon momentum preserves the uncertainty principle; since the photon is scattered anywhere within the aperture, the uncertainty of momentum transferred equals

:<math>
\Delta p \sim p_{\mathrm{photon}} \sin\theta = \frac{h}{\lambda} \sin\theta
</math>

giving the product <math>\Delta x \Delta p \, \sim \, h</math>, which is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  Thus, all the world is quantized; both matter and fields must obey a consistent set of quantum laws, if either one is to be quantized.

In the same papers, Einstein extended Bose's formalism to material particles ([[boson]]s) and predicted that they would condense into their lowest quantum state at low enough temperatures; this [[Bose<U+2013>Einstein condensate|Bose<U+2013>Einstein condensation]] was observed experimentally in 1995<ref>{{cite journal | last = Anderson | first = MH | coauthors = Ensher JR, Matthews MR, [[Carl Wieman|Wieman CE]], and [[Eric Allin Cornell|Cornell EA]] | title=Observation of Bose<U+2013>Einstein Condensation in a Dilute Atomic Vapor | journal=Science | year=1995 | volume=269 | pages=198&mdash;201 | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0036-8075%2819950714%293%3A269%3A5221%3C198%3AOOBCIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G }}</ref>.

Photons must obey [[Bose<U+2013>Einstein statistics]] if they are to allow the [[superposition principle]] of [[electromagnetic field]]s, the condition that [[Maxwell's equations]] are linear.  All particles are divided into [[boson]]s and [[fermion]]s, depending on whether  they have integer or half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]], respectively.  The [[spin-statistics theorem]] shows that all bosons obey Bose<U+2013>Einstein statistics, whereas all fermions obey [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]] or, equivalently, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that at most one particle can occupy any given state.  Thus, if the photon were a fermion, only one photon could move in a particular direction at a time.  This is inconsistent with the experimental observation that lasers can produce coherent light of arbitrary intensity, that is, with many photons moving in the same direction.  Hence, the photon must be a boson and obey Bose<U+2013>Einstein statistics.

==Stimulated and spontaneous emission==

{{main|Stimulated emission|Laser}}

[[Image:Stimulatedemission.png|thumb|400px|right|[[Stimulated emission]] (in which photons "clone" themselves) was predicted by Einstein in his kinetic derivation of E=h<U+03BD>, and led to the development of the [[laser]].  Einstein's derivation also provoked further developments in the quantum treatment of light, the semiclassical model and [[quantum electrodynamics]] (see below).]]
 
In 1916, Einstein showed that Planck's quantum hypothesis <math>E = h\nu</math> could be derived from a kinetic rate equation.<ref name="Einstein1916a" />  Consider a cavity in [[thermal equilibrium]] and filled with [[electromagnetic radiation]] and systems that can emit and absorb that radiation.  Thermal equilibrium requires that the number density <math>\rho(\nu)</math> of photons with frequency <math>\nu</math> is constant in time; hence, the rate of ''emitting'' photons of that frequency must equal the rate of ''absorbing'' them.

Einstein hypothesized that the rate <math>R_{ji}</math> for a system to ''absorb'' a photon of frequency <math>\nu</math> and transition from a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> to a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> was proportional to the number <math>N_{j}</math> of molecules with energy <math>E_{j}</math> and to the number density <math>\rho(\nu)</math> of ambient photons with that frequency

:<math>
R_{ji} = N_{j} B_{ji} \rho(\nu) \!
</math>

where <math>B_{ji}</math> is the [[rate constant]] for absorption.

More daringly, Einstein hypothesized that the reverse rate <math>R_{ij}</math> for a system to ''emit'' a photon of frequency <math>\nu</math> and transition from a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> to a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> was composed of two terms:

:<math>
R_{ij} = N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} \rho(\nu) \!
</math>

where <math>A_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for [[spontaneous emission|emitting a photon spontaneously]], and <math>B_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for emitting it in response to ambient photons ([[stimulated emission|induced or stimulated emission]]).  Einstein showed that Planck's energy formula <math>E = h\nu</math> is a necessary consequence of these hypothesized rate equations and the basic requirements that the ambient radiation be in thermal equilibrium with the systems that absorb and emit the radiation and independent of the systems' material composition.

This simple kinetic model was a powerful stimulus for research.  Einstein was able to show that <math>B_{ij} = B_{ji}</math> (i.e., the rate constants for induced emission and absorption are equal) and, perhaps more remarkably,

:<math>
A_{ij} = \frac{8 \pi h \nu^{3}}{c^{3}} B_{ij}
</math>

Einstein did not attempt to justify his rate equations but noted that <math>A_{ij}</math> and <math>B_{ij}</math> should be derivable from a "mechanics and electrodynamics modified to accommodate the quantum hypothesis".  This prediction was borne out in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]], respectively; both are required to derive Einstein's rate constants from first principles.  [[Paul Dirac]] derived the <math>B_{ij}</math> rate constants in 1926 using a semiclassical approach,<ref name="Dirac1926">{{cite journal | last = Dirac | first = PAM | authorlink = Paul Dirac | year = 1926 | title = On the Theory of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Proc.

Einstein was troubled by the fact that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not determine the ''direction'' of a spontaneously emitted photon.  A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in his treatment of [[birefringence]] and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam.  Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which path it would follow.<ref name="Newton1730" />  Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation<ref name="Pais1982" /> from quantum mechanics.  Ironically, [[Max Born]]'s [[probability amplitude|probabilistic interpretation]] of the [[wave function]]<ref name="Born1926a">{{cite journal | last = Born | first = M | authorlink = Max Born | year = 1926a | title = Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorg<U+00E4>nge | journal = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik | volume = 37 | pages = 863&mdash;867}} {{de icon}}</ref><ref name="Born1926b">{{cite journal | last = Born | first = M | | authorlink = Max Born | year = 1926b | title = Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorg<U+00E4>nge | journal = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik | volume = 38 | pages = 803}} {{de icon}}</ref> was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.<ref name="ghost_field">{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1986 | title = Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World | publisher = Oxford University Press}}  Specifically, Born claimed to have been inspired by Einstein's never-published attempts to develop a "ghost-field" theory, in which point-like photons are guided probabilistically by ghost fields that follow Maxwell's equations.</ref>

==Second quantization==

{{main|Quantum field theory}}

[[Image:Visible_EM_modes.png|thumb|200px|right|Different ''electromagnetic modes'' (such as those depicted here) can be treated as independent [[quantum harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillators]].  A photon corresponds to a unit of energy E=h<U+03BD> in its electromagentic mode.]]

In 1910, [[Peter Debye]] derived [[Planck's law of black-body radiation]] from a relatively simple assumption.<ref name="Debye1910">{{cite journal | last = Debye | first = P | authorlink = Peter Debye | year = 1910 | title = Der Wahrscheinlichkeitsbegriff in der Theorie der Strahlung | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 33 | pages = 1427&ndash;34}} {{de icon}}</ref>  He correctly decomposed the electromagnetic field in a cavity into its [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]], and assumed that the energy in any mode was an integer multiple of <math>h\nu \!</math>, where <math>\nu \!</math> is the frequency of the electromagnetic mode.  Planck's law of black-body radiation follows immediately as a geometric sum.  However, Debye's approach failed to give the correct formula for the energy fluctuations of blackbody radiation, which were derived by Einstein in 1909.<ref name="Einstein1909" />

In 1925, [[Max Born|Born]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]] reinterpreted Debye's concept in a key way.<ref name="Born1925">{{cite journal | last = Born | first = M | authorlink = Max Born | coauthors = [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg W]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan P]] | year = 1925 | title = Quantenmechanik II | journal = Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik | volume = 35 | pages = 557&ndash;615}} {{de icon}}</ref>  As may be shown classically, the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic field]]  &mdash; a complete set of electromagnetic plane waves indexed by their wave vector <math>\mathbf{k}</math> and polarization state &mdash; are equivalent to a set of uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators.  Treated quantum mechanically, the energy levels of such oscillators are known to be <math>E = nh\nu \!</math>, where <math>\nu \!</math> is the oscillator frequency.  The key new step was to identify an electromagnetic mode with energy <math>E = nh\nu \!</math> as a state with <math>n \!</math> photons, each of energy <math>h\nu \!</math>.  This approach gives the correct energy fluctuation formula.

[[Image:vertex_correction.png|thumb|300px|left|In quantum field theory, [[probability amplitude|probabilities of events]] are computed by summing over all possible ways in which they can happen, as in the [[Feynman diagram]] shown here.]]

[[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] took this one step further.<ref name="Dirac1927a" /><ref name="Dirac1927b" />  He treated the interaction between a charge and an electromagnetic field  as a small perturbation that induces transitions in the photon states, changing the numbers of photons in the modes, while conserving energy and momentum overall.  Dirac was able to derive Einstein's <math>A_{ij} \!</math> and <math>B_{ij} \!</math> coefficients from first principles, and showed that the Bose<U+2013>Einstein statistics of photons is a natural consequence of quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly.  (Bose's reasoning went in the opposite direction; he derived [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] by ''assuming'' BE statistics.)  In Dirac's time, it was not yet known that all bosons, including photons, must obey BE statistics.

Dirac's second-order [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] can involve [[virtual particle|virtual photons]], transient intermediate states of the electromagnetic field; the static [[Coulomb's law|electric]] and [[magnetism|magnetic]] interactions are mediated by such virtual photons.  In such [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], the [[probability amplitude]] of observable events is calculated by summing over ''all'' possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy <math>E = p \, c \!</math>, and may have extra [[polarization]] states; depending on the [[gauge fixing|gauge]] used, virtual photons may have three or four polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons.  Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of  observable events.  Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can make [[infinity|infinite]] contributions to the sum, a problem that was overcome in [[quantum electrodynamics]] by [[renormalization]].  Other virtual particles may contribute to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual [[electron]]-[[positron]] [[pair production|pairs]].

In modern physics notation, the [[quantum state]] of the electromagnetic field is written as a [[Fock state]], a [[tensor product]] of the states for each electromagnetic mode

:<math>|n_{k_0}\rangle\otimes|n_{k_1}\rangle\otimes\dots\otimes|n_{k_n}\rangle\dots</math>

where <math>|n_{k_i}\rangle</math> represents the state in which <math>\, n_{k_i}</math> photons are in the mode <math>\, k_i</math>.  In this notation, the creation of a new photon in mode <math>\, k_i</math> (e.g., emitted from an atomic transition) is written as <math>|n_{k_i}\rangle \rightarrow |n_{k_i}+1\rangle</math>.  This notation merely expresses the concept of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan described above, and does not add any physics.

==The photon as a gauge boson==

{{main|Gauge theory}}

The electromagnetic field can be understood as a [[gauge theory]], i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a symmetry hold independently at every position in [[spacetime]].<ref name="Ryder">{{cite book | last = Ryder | first = LH | year = 1996 | title = Quantum field theory | edition = 2nd edition | publisher = Cambridge University Press | id=ISBN 0521478146}}</ref>  For the [[electromagnetic field]], this gauge symmetry is the [[unitary group|U(1) symmetry]] of a [[complex number]], which reflects the ability to vary the [[complex geometry|phase]] of a complex number without affecting [[real number]]s constructed from it, such as the [[energy]] or the [[Lagrangian]].

The quanta of a [[gauge theory|gauge field]] must be massless bosons, as long as the symmetry is not broken; hence, the photon is predicted to be massless and to have integer spin.  The particular form of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] specifies that the photon must have zero [[electric charge]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] <U+00B1>1; thus, its [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] must be <math>\pm \hbar</math>.  These two spin components correspond to the classical concepts of [[circular polarization|right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized]] light.  However, the transient [[virtual photon]]s of [[quantum electrodynamics]] may also adopt unphysical polarization states.<ref name="Ryder" />

In the prevailing [[Standard Model]] of physics, the photon is one of four [[gauge bosons]] in the [[electroweak interaction]]; the [[W and Z bosons|other three]] are denoted W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup> and Z<sup>0</sup> and are responsible for the [[weak interaction]].  Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have [[invariant mass]], owing to a [[Higgs mechanism|mechanism]] that breaks their [[special unitary group|SU(2) gauge symmetry]].  The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Steven Weinberg]], for which they were awarded the 1979 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.<ref name="Glashow">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/glashow-lecture.html Sheldon Glashow Nobel lecture], delivered [[8 December]] [[1979]].</ref><ref name="Salam">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-lecture.html Abdus Salam Nobel lecture], delivered [[8 December]] [[1979]].</ref><ref name="Weinberg">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/weinberg-lecture.html Steven Weinberg Nobel lecture], delivered [[8 December]] [[1979]].</ref>  Physicists continue to hypothesize [[grand unification theory|grand unified theories]] that connect these four [[gauge bosons]] with the eight [[gluon]] gauge bosons of [[quantum chromodynamics]]; however, key predictions of these theories, such as [[proton decay]], have not been observed experimentally.

==Contributions of photons to the invariant mass of a system==

{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Gravitation}}

Although the photon is itself massless, it adds to the [[invariant mass]] of any system to which it belongs; this is true for every form of [[energy]], as predicted by the [[special theory of relativity]].  For example, the invariant mass of a system that emits a photon is ''decreased'' by an amount <math>{E}/{c^2}</math> upon emission, where <math>E</math> is the energy of the photon in the frame of the emitting system.  Similarly, the invariant mass of a system that absorbs a photon is ''increased'' by a corresponding amount based on the energy of the photon in the frame of the absorbing system.  

This concept is applied in a key prediction of QED, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]] begun by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] (described above).  QED is able to predict the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment|magnetic dipole moment]] of [[lepton]]s to extremely high accuracy; experimental measurements of these magnetic dipole moments have agreed with these predictions perfectly.  The predictions, however, require counting the contributions of virtual photons to the invariant mass of the lepton.  Another example of such contributions verified experimentally is the QED prediction of the [[Lamb shift]] observed in the [[hyperfine structure]] of bound lepton pairs, such as [[muonium]] and [[positronium]].

Since photons contribute to the [[stress-energy tensor]], they exert a  [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] on other objects, according to the theory of [[general relativity]].  Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped [[spacetime]], as in [[gravitational lensing]], and [[gravitational redshift|their frequencies may be lowered]] by moving to a higher [[potential energy|gravitational potential]], as in the [[Pound-Rebka experiment]].  However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]].

==Photons in matter==

{{See also|Group velocity|Photochemistry}}

Photons of different frequencies travel through matter at [[variable speed of light|different speeds]]; this is called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].  In matter, the photon blends with quantum excitations of the matter ([[quasi-particle]]s such as [[phonon]]s and [[exciton]]s) to form a [[polariton]]; this polariton has a nonzero [[effective mass]], which means that it cannot travel at ''c'', the speed of light in a vacuum.  This is the formal reason why light is slower in media (such as glass) than in vacuum.  The polariton propagation speed <math>v</math> equals its [[group velocity]], which is the [[derivative]] of the energy with respect to momentum 

:<math>
v = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{dE}{dp}
</math>
[[Image:RetinalCisandTrans.png|250px|right|thumb|[[Retinal]] straightens after absorbing a [[photon]] &gamma; of the correct wavelength.]]
where, as above, <math>E</math> and <math>p</math> are the polariton's energy and momentum magnitude, and <math>\omega</math> and <math>k</math> are its angular frequency and wave number, respectively.  In some cases, the dispersion can result in [[slow light|extremely slow speeds of light]].  The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in [[Raman scattering]] and [[Brillouin scattering]].

Photons can also be [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking transitions between their [[energy level]]s.  A classic example is the molecular transition of [[retinal]] (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O, Figure at right), which is responsible for [[vision]], as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist [[George Wald]] and co-workers.  As shown here, the absorption provokes a ''cis-trans'' isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses.  The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the [[photodissociation]] of [[chlorine]]; this is the subject of [[photochemistry]].

==Photons in technology==

Photons have many applications in technology.  These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons ''per se'', rather than general optical devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light.  The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under [[stimulated emission]]. 

Individual photons can be detected by several methods.  The classic [[photomultiplier]] tube exploits the [[photoelectric effect]]; a photon landing on a metal plate ejects an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons.  [[Charge-coupled device]] chips use a similar effect in [[semiconductor]]s; an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can be detected. Other detectors such as [[Geiger counter]]s use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules, causing a detectable change in conductivity.

Planck's energy formula <math>E=h\nu</math> is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to predict the frequency of the light emitted for a given energy transition.  For example, the [[emission spectrum]] of a [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent light bulb]] can be designed using gas molecules with different electronic energy levels and adjusting the typical energy with which an electron hits the gas molecules within the bulb.  

Under some conditions, an energy transition can be excited by ''two'' photons that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the region where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see [[two-photon excitation microscopy]]).  Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.  

In some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system absorbs a photon, another nearby system "steals" its energy and re-emits a photon of a different frequency.  This is the basis of [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], which is used to measure molecular distances.

==Recent research in photons==

{{See also|Quantum optics}}

The fundamental nature of the photon is believed to be understood theoretically; the prevailing [[Standard Model]] predicts that the photon is a massless, chargeless boson of spin 1 that results from a local [[unitary group|U(1) gauge symmetry]] and mediates the electromagnetic interaction.  However, physicists continue to check for discrepancies between experiment and the Standard Model predictions, in the hopes of finding clues to physics beyond the Standard Model.  In particular, physicists continue to set ever better upper limits on the charge and mass of the photon; a nonzero value for either parameter would be a serious violation of the Standard Model.  However, all experimental data hitherto are consistent with the photon having zero charge<ref name="chargeless" /> and mass.<ref name="massless">(a) {{cite journal | last = Goldhaber | first = AS | year = 1971 | title = [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v43/i3/p277_1 Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Limits on The Photon Mass] | journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume = 43 | pages = 277&ndash;96.}}<br />(b) {{cite journal | last = Fischbach | first = E | coauthors = Kloor H, Langel RA, Lui ATY, and Peredo M | year = 1994 | title = New Geomagnetic Limits on the Photon Mass and on Long-Range Forces Coexisting with Electromagnetism | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 73 | pages = 514&ndash;17.}}<br />(c) Official particle table http://pdg.lbl.gov/2005/tables/gxxx.pdf<br />(d) {{cite journal | last = Davis | first = L | coauthors = Goldhaber AS and Nieto MM | year = 1975 | title = Limit on Photon Mass Deduced from Pioneer-10 Observations of Jupiter's Magnetic Field | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 35 | pages = 1402&mdash;1405.}}<br />(e) {{cite journal | last = Luo | first = J | coauthors = Shao CG, Liu ZZ, and Hu ZK | year = 1999 | title = Determination of the limit of photon mass and cosmic magnetic vector with rotating torsion balance | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 270 | pages = 288&mdash;292.}}<br>(f) {{cite journal | last = Schaeffer | first = BE | year = 1999 | title = Severe limits on variations of the speed of light with frequency | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 82 | pages = 4964&mdash;4966.}}<br />(g) {{cite journal | last = Luo | first = J | coauthors = Tu LC, Hu ZK, and Luan EJ | year = 2003 | title = New experimental limit on the photon rest mass with a rotating torsion balance | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 90 | pages = Art.

Much research has been devoted to applications of photons in the field of [[quantum optics]].  Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an ultra-fast [[quantum computer]], and the [[quantum entanglement]] of photons is a focus of research.  [[Nonlinear optics|Nonlinear optical processes]] are another active research area, with topics such as  two-photon absorption, [[self-phase modulation]] and [[optical parametric oscillator]]s.  However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons ''per se''; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators.  The nonlinear process of [[spontaneous parametric down conversion]] is often used to produce single-photon states.  Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of [[optical communication]], especially for [[quantum cryptography]].
