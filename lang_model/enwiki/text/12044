'''Operation Entebbe''', also known as the '''Jonatan Operation''' ({{lang-he|<U+05DE><U+05D1><U+05E6><U+05E2> <U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05EA><U+05DF>}}) or '''Entebbe Raid''' or '''Operation Thunderbolt''', was a [[Counterterrorism|counter-terrorism]] hostage-rescue mission carried out by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) at [[Entebbe Airport]] in [[Uganda]] on the night of 3 July and early morning of 4 July 1976.  In the wake of the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of [[Air France]] Flight 139 and the hijackers' threats to kill the [[hostage]]s if their prisoner release demands were not met, a plan was drawn up to airlift the hostages to safety.  These plans took into account the likelihood of armed resistance from Ugandan military troops.

Originally [[codename]]d ''Operation Thunderball'' by the IDF (or ''Operation Thunderbolt'' in some sources), the operation was [[retroactive nomenclature|retroactively renamed]] ''Operation Yonatan'' in memory of the [[Sayeret Matkal]] commander [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Yonatan Netanyahu|Yonatan "Yoni" Netanyahu]], who was killed in action.  Three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed and five Israeli [[commando]]s were wounded.  A fourth hostage was killed by Ugandan army officers at a nearby hospital.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B11FD3E5D12728DDDAD0894DE405B898BF1D3 "Body of Amin Victim Is Flown Back to Israel."] ''New York Times''. 4 June 1979, Monday, p.

==Hijack==
On 27 June 1976, [[Air France]] Flight 139, an [[Airbus A300]] (Airbus A300B4-203), registration F-BVGG (cn 019), originating from [[Tel Aviv, Israel]], carrying 238 passengers and a crew of 12, took off from [[Athens]], heading for Paris.  Soon after the 12:30 p.m. takeoff, the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by two [[Palestinians]] from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations]] (PFLP-EO) and two Germans from the German "[[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)]]" ([[Wilfried B<U+00F6>se]] and [[Brigitte Kuhlmann]]), who commandeered the flight, diverting it to [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]].{{Fact|date=May 2009}}  There it was held on the ground for seven hours for refuelling, during which time a female hostage who pretended she was pregnant and having a miscarriage was released.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3269662,00.html "Mossad took photos, Entebbe Operation was on its way."] ''[[Ynetnews]]''. 2006</ref>  The plane left Benghazi, and at 3:15 it arrived at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] in [[Uganda]].{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

At Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by four others, supported by the pro-Palestinian forces of Uganda's President, [[Idi Amin]].  The hijackers were led by B<U+00F6>se (and not, as occasionally reported, by [[Carlos the Jackal]]).{{Fact|date=March 2008}}  They demanded the release of 40 Palestinians held in [[Israel]]. and 13 other detainees imprisoned in [[Kenya]], France, Switzerland, and West Germany; if these demands were not met, they threatened to begin killing hostages on 1 July 1976.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

The hijackers deliberately sorted the hostages into Jew and [[Gentile]]s.<ref name=DT-1977>David Tinnin, ''Like Father'', [[Time (magazine)]], 8 August 1977. A review of ''Hitler's children'' by Julian Becker, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915234-2,00.html Page 2]</ref>  As they did so a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor showed B<U+00F6>se a [[Identification in Nazi camps|camp registration number tattooed]] on his arm, B<U+00F6>se protested "I'm no Nazi! ...

Some hostages were released, but 105 Israelis and French Jews remained captive.<ref>Ben, Eyal.

Upon the announcement by the hijackers that the airline crew and non-Jewish passengers would be released and put on another Air France plane that had been brought to Entebbe for that purpose, the flight captain (Michel Bacos) told the hijackers that all passengers, including the remaining ones, were his responsibility, and that he would not leave them behind.  Bacos' entire crew followed suit.  A French [[nun]] also refused to leave, insisting that one of the remaining hostages take her place, but she was forced into the awaiting Air France plane by Ugandan soldiers.<ref>{{cite news |author=Feldinger, Lauren Gelfond |title=Back to Entebbe |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885879544&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=2006-06-29 |quote=A nun who refused to separate herself from the Jews was pushed out to freedom}}</ref>  A total of 83 Israeli and/or Jewish hostages remained, as well as 20 others, most of whom included the crew of the Air France plane.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Raid==
On the 1 July deadline,<ref>Grimes, Paul. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00712F7355E1A738DDDA90B94DF405B868BF1D3 "Rescuing the Entebbe Hostages."] ''New York Times''. Friday, 30 July 1976. (The Weekend, p. 51)</ref> the [[government of Israel|Israeli government]] offered to negotiate with the hijackers in order to extend the deadline to 4 July. [[Idi Amin]] asked the hijackers to extend the deadline until 4 July, so he could take a diplomatic trip to [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]], in order to officially hand over the [[Chair (official)|chairmanship]] of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] to [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref>Lipkin-Shakhak, Tali.

On 3 July, the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] approved a rescue mission,<ref>Smith Terence. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60816FA38591B728DDDAD0894DF405B868BF1D3 "Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport."] ''New York Times''. Sunday, 4 July 1976.</ref> Operation Entebbe, under the command of [[Aluf|Major General]] [[Yekutiel Adam|Yekutiel "Kuti" Adam]]; the Deputy Commander was [[Matan Vilnai]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/6/Matan%20Vilnai ''Matan Vilnai: Deputy Minister of Defense''.] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</ref>  [[Tat Aluf|Brigadier General]] [[Dan Shomron]] was appointed to command the operation on the ground.<ref name=ediary>[http://dover.idf.il/IDF/console/article_page.aspx?doc_id=23016&lang=english Israel Defense Forces - Entebbe Diary]</ref>  After days of collecting [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and planning by Netanyahu's deputy Moshe "Muki" Betser, four [[Israeli Air Force]] [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft flew secretly to Entebbe Airport, by cover of night, without aid of Entebbe ground control.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Their route was over [[Sharm al-Sheikh]], and down the international flight path over the [[Red Sea]], flying at a height of no more than 100 feet to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces.  Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned right and passed south of [[Djibouti]].  From there they went to a point north east of [[Nairobi]], Kenya (likely across [[Somalia]] and the [[Ogaden]] area of [[Ethiopia]]), then turned west passing through the [[African Rift Valley]] and over [[Lake Victoria]].<ref>page 100 of book ''Ninety Minutes at Entebbe'', see [[Operation Entebbe#References]]</ref>  They were followed by two [[Boeing 707]] jets.  The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].  The commander of the operation, General [[Yekutiel Adam]], was on board the second Boeing that circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.<ref name=ediary/> [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Ulrich Wegener]], commander of the elite German [[GSG 9]] anti-terrorist group, was invited to participate in the Israeli hostage rescue mission, and was rumoured to be one of the 5 injured commandos on the raid.{{Fact|date=May 2009}} 

The Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following:

*'''The Ground Command & Control Element'''
:This small group comprised the overall ground commander, Brig. Gen. Shomron, and the communications and support personnel.

*'''The Assault or "Takeover" Element''' 
:Led by Lt. Col. Netanyahu, this force was composed entirely of commandos from [[Sayeret Matkal]], and were given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element's assault teams, Matan Vilnai led another.

*'''The Blocking/Reinforcement or "Engagement" Element''' 
# Securing the area, and preventing any hostile [[ground force]] from interfering with the C-130 Hercules aircraft and the actual rescue.
# Destroying the squadron of MiG fighter jets on the ground, to prevent any possible interceptions by the [[Ugandan Air Force]].
# Assisting in the ground refuelling of the air transports.
# Providing protection for and assisting in the loading of the hostages aboard the transports.

The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe an hour before midnight, with their [[cargo bay]] doors already open.  A black [[Mercedes-Benz 600|Mercedes]] with accompanying [[Land Rover]]s was taken along to give the impression that the Israeli troops driving from the landed [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] to the terminal building were an escort for a returning Idi Amin, or other high-ranking official.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

The Mercedes and its escort vehicles were quickly driven by the Israeli assault team members to the airport terminal in the same fashion as Amin.  However, along the way, two Ugandan sentries, who were aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes to replace his black one, ordered this procession of vehicles to stop.  The commandos shot both of these sentries with silenced pistols.  As they pulled away, an Israeli commando in one of the Land Rovers noticed that they had failed to eliminate the sentries and immediately killed them with a burst from his [[Kalashnikov]]. Fearing premature alerting of associates to the hijackers, the Israeli assault team was quickly sent into action.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. The Israelis sprang from their vehicles and burst into the terminal, shouting through a megaphone, "Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers."<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html Special: Entebbe's unsung hero - Israel News, Ynetnews<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in both [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] and English.  A 19-year-old French Jew named Jean-Jacques Maimoni (who chose to identify himself as an Israeli Jew to the hijackers even though he had a French passport), stood up, however.<ref name="autogenerated2" />  He was killed by the Israeli commandos, who mistook him for a hijacker.  Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, manager of an Israeli medical insurance fund, was also fatally wounded by gunfire, either from the hijackers or accidentally by the Israeli commandos.<ref name="autogenerated2" />  A third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], was also killed in the crossfire.<ref name="unsung">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html "Entebbe's unsung hero"], ''[[Ynetnews]].com.'' 2006.</ref>  At one point, an Israeli commando called out in Hebrew, "Where are the rest of them?", referring to the hijackers.<ref name="autogenerated2" />  The hostages pointed to a connecting door of the airport's main hall, into which the Israeli commandos threw several [[hand grenade]]s. They then entered the room and shot dead the three remaining hijackers, thus completing their assault.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Meanwhile, the other three [[C-130 Hercules]] had landed and unloaded [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, which were to be used for defense during the anticipated hour of refuelling, for the destruction of Ugandan [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighters]] at the airport so as to prevent them from pursuing the Israelis after their departure from Entebbe Airport, and for intelligence-gathering.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

After the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages on board.  Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process. The Israeli commandos returned fire, killing many Ugandan soldiers.  During this brief but intense fire fight, a Ugandan [[sniper]] in the [[airport control tower]] shot and killed Commander [[Yonatan Netanyahu]]. He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation. The Israelis finished the loading, loaded Netanyahu's body into one of the aeroplanes, and then left Entebbe Airport.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

The entire assault lasted 53 minutes, and all eight hijackers were killed. At least five other Israeli commandos were wounded.  Out of the 105 hostages, three were killed and approximately 10 were wounded. A total of 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed during the raid, and about 11 Ugandan Army Air Force [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] [[fighter plane]]s were destroyed on the ground at Entebbe Airport. The rescued hostages were flown to Israel via [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], shortly after the fighting.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Dora Bloch, a 75-year-old hostage taken to [[Mulago Hospital]] in [[Kampala]], was murdered by the Ugandan government, as were some of her doctors and nurses for apparently trying to intervene.<ref name="unsung"/>  In April 1987, [[Henry Kyemba]], Uganda's [[Attorney General]] and [[Minister of Justice]] at the time, told the [[Uganda Human Rights Commission]] that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and murdered by two army officers on Idi Amin's orders.  Bloch's remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) east of [[Kampala]] in 1979,<ref name=autogenerated3 /> after the [[Ugandan<U+2013>Tanzanian War]] led to the end of Amin's rule.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Background==
Israeli firms were often involved in building projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s. One reason the raid was so well-planned was that the building in which the hostages were being held was built by [[Solel Boneh]], an Israeli construction firm, which still had the [[blueprint]]s, and supplied them to the government of Israel.  Additionally, [[Mossad]] (Israel's intelligence service) built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of militants. and the involvement of Ugandan troops from the released hostages in Paris.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914272,00.html ''Time Magazine'', "The Rescue: 'We Do the Impossible'."] ''Time Magazine''. Monday, 12 July 1976.</ref> 

While planning the military operation, the Israeli army built a partial replica of the airport terminal with the help of some Israeli civilians who had helped build it in the first place.  A very high level of secrecy was maintained, and the civilian [[contractor]]s who had built the replica were detained as "guests" of the military until the rescue was declared a success.<ref>[http://www.operationentebbe.com/p1_preparation.php Preparation for the Raid on Entebbe] Answers 2000 Ltd. Verified 14 Dec 2008.</ref>

According to a 5 July. 2006, [[Associated Press]] interview with raid organizer "Muki" Betser, [[Mossad]] operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released.<ref name="betzer">[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-04-palestinian-pressure_x.htm "Israel marks 30th anniversary of Entebbe."] ''Associated Press'' in ''USA Today''. 5 July 2006.</ref> As a result, another source of information was a French-Jewish passenger who had been mistakenly released with the non-Jewish hostages.  Betser reports that the man had military training and "a phenomenal memory," allowing him to give information about the number and arms of the hostage-takers, among other useful details.<ref name="betzer"/> 

In the week prior to the raid, Israel had tried a number of political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages.  Many sources indicate that the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed.  A retired IDF officer, Baruch "Burka" Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him.  At the request of the cabinet he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, attempting to obtain the release of the hostages, without success.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914380,00.html "Vindication for the Israelis."] ''Time Magazine''. 26 July 1976]</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914382,00.html "War of Words over a Tense Border."] ''Time Magazine''. 26 July 1976.</ref>

==Claim of Israeli involvement==
According to a UK government file on the crisis, an unnamed contact within the Euro-Arab Parliamentary Association told a British diplomat in Paris, shortly after the hijacking, that the Israeli Secret Services and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), acted together to seize the plane.  According to this version, the [[Shin Bet]] helped design the operation to undermine the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]'s standing in France and its rapprochement with the USA.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6710289.stm |title=Israel hijack role 'was queried'|accessdate=1 June|accessyear=2007 |last=Parkinson |first=Daniel |year=2007 |month=June |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Israel denied the contact's claim about Israeli involvement,<ref>[http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Diplomacy/11465.htm "Eitam: UK claims of Israeli collusion in 1976 hijacking 'audacious'."] ''[[Israel Insider]]''. 2 June 2007.</ref> with officials in the Vice Premier's office calling it "foolishness" and "not worthy of comment."<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/127461 Israel: "BBC Entebbe Story 'Ridiculous'."] Israel National News. 2 June 2007.</ref>  The absence of specific details supporting the allegation led to claims that there had been a deliberate act of disinformation, an attempt to develop a [[conspiracy theory]].<ref name="mideastweb">Hochstein, Joseph M. [http://www.mideastweb.org/log/archives/00000592.htm  ''Claims of Entebbe conspiracy lack credibility''.] Mideastweb.org. 8 June 2007</ref>

== Aftermath ==
The [[government of Uganda]] later convened a session of the [[United Nations Security Council]] to seek official condemnation of the Israeli raid,<ref>Teltsch, Kathleen. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B11F73F5B167493C2A8178CD85F428785F9 "Uganda Bids  U.N. Condemn Israel for Airport Raid."] ''New York Times. 10 July 1976. (Section: The Week In Review)</ref> as a violation of Ugandan [[sovereignty]].  The Security Council ultimately declined to pass any resolution on the matter.  In his address to the Council, Israeli ambassador [[Chaim Herzog]] said:

{{quote|We come with a simple message to the Council: we are proud of what we have done because we have demonstrated to the world that a small country, in Israel's circumstances, with which the members of this Council are by now all too familiar, the dignity of man, human life and human freedom constitute the highest values. We are proud not only because we have saved the lives of over a hundred innocent people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;but because of the significance of our act for the cause of human freedom.<ref>Herzog, Chaim. ''Heroes of Israel''. p. 284.</ref><ref>Fendel, Hillel. [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/106568 "Israel Commemorates 30th Anniversary of Entebbe Rescue."] ''[[Israel National News]]''.</ref>|HERZOG, Chaim.}}

UN Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]] described the raid as "a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state" (meaning Uganda).<ref>National Review, 9 July 2007, Vol. LIX, No. 12, see also http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/world/europe/14cnd-waldheim.html?_r=1&pagewanted=3&hp&oref=slogin</ref>

For refusing to depart when given leave to do so by the hijackers, Captain Bacos was reprimanded by his superiors at Air France and suspended from duty for a period.<ref>Kaplan, David E. [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1154525798527&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter "A historic hostage-taking revisited."] ''Jerusalem Post''. 3 August 2006.</ref>

Idi Amin was humiliated by the surprise raid. He believed Kenya had colluded with Israel in planning the raid and hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda were massacred soon afterwards. But from this time, Amin's regime began to break down. Two years later, Amin was forced into exile in Saudi Arabia. He died in [[Jeddah]] in August 2003.

In the ensuing years, Betser and the Netanyahu brothers ([[Iddo Netanyahu|Iddo]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Benjamin]]), all [[Sayeret Matkal]] veterans, argued in increasingly public forums about who was to blame for the unexpected early firefight which caused Yonatan Netanyahu's death and partial loss of tactical surprise.<ref>Sharon Roffe-Ofir [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3270234,00.html "Entebbe's open wound"] ''Ynet'', 7 February 2006</ref> <ref>Josh Hamerman [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3384084,00.html "Battling against 'the falsification of history'"] ''Ynet News'', 4 February 2007</ref>  This has become an open wound in the close-knit Sayeret Matkal family.
