The '''SS ''Christopher Columbus''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[passenger ship|excursion liner]] on the [[Great Lakes]], in service between 1893 and 1933. She was the only [[whaleback]] ship ever built for passenger service. The ship was designed by [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], the developer and promoter of the whaleback design.<ref name="ah">{{cite journal |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2001/2/2001_2_24_print.shtml |title=You Call That Damn Thing a Boat? |journal=[[Invention and Technology Magazine|American Heritage of Invention & Technology]] |last=Ebeling |first=Charles W. |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |volume=17 |issue=2 |month=Fall |year=2001 |accessdate= August 31, 2007 |issn= 8756-7296 |oclc=11638224 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929121045/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2001/2/2001_2_24_print.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> 

''Columbus'' was built between 1892 and 1893 at [[Superior, Wisconsin]], by the [[American Steel Barge Company]].

==Background and proposal==
{{main|Whaleback}}
The history of the ''Columbus'' is linked with that of the whalebacks, an innovative but not widely accepted ship design of the late 1880s, and of their designer, [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]]. A [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]], Great Lakes [[captain (nautical)|captain]], inventor<ref name="about-whale">{{cite web

 |work=[http://www.abouthegreatlakes.com/ About the Great Lakes]
 |title=Remember the Whaleback Steamers
 |accessdate=August 18, 2007}}</ref> and entrepreneur, McDougall developed the idea of the whaleback as a way to improve the ability of [[barge]]s to follow a towing vessel in heavy seas.<ref name="ah"/> Whalebacks were characterized by distinctive [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] shapes with rounded tops, lacking conventional vertical sides. Waves thus broke across their hulls with considerably less force than when striking a conventional hull. Water could also flow around the rounded turrets which resembled [[gun turret]]s on contemporary warships; the superstructure and deckhouses were mounted on these turrets.<ref name = Duerkop>{{cite web | last = Duerkop | first = John | title = Some Marine Terminology | work = Research Resources | publisher = Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Kingston | month = July | year = 2007 | url = http://www.marmuseum.ca/duerkop.html | accessdate = 2008-03-22 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080311063134/http://www.marmuseum.ca/duerkop.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2008-03-11 }} (definition 65, <U+2018><U+2019>Whaleback<U+2019><U+2019>).</ref> The rounded contours of whalebacks gave them an unconventional appearance,<ref name="ah"/>

After McDougall was unable to persuade existing shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in [[Superior, Wisconsin]] in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the [[SS Charles W. Wetmore|SS ''Charles W. Wetmore'']] to London, and starting another shipyard in [[Everett, Washington]], which built the [[SS City of Everett|SS ''City of Everett'']].<ref name="wash">{{cite web

She was fitted out over the remainder of late 1892 and early 1893. Electric lighting was used, and she was elegantly furnished.

McDougall's American Steel Barge Company had committed in the contract that the ''Columbus'' would be built and delivered in three months, making her one of the fastest-built large ships of her time. The builders further promised rapid loading and unloading, predicting that the vessel would be able to embark 5,000&nbsp;passengers in five minutes, and disembark the same passengers in even less time. The ''Columbus'' was specified to be able run the {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} from the dock downtown to the fairgrounds at [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] and 64th Street in 20&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="seaC"/><ref name="dream">{{cite book

McDougall set up another holding company, the Columbian Whaleback Steamship Company of [[Duluth, Minnesota]], to own and operate the ''Columbus''. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on May 13, 1893. Her first captain was John McArthur, who had captained other whalebacks for McDougall's firms, starting with the first powered whaleback, the ''Colgate Hoyt'', built in 1890.

In 1915, the [[SS Eastland|SS ''Eastland'']] capsized while docked in the Chicago River, with the loss of over 800 lives. Officials subsequently ordered many passenger ships to undergo stability testing, which the ''Columbus'' passed easily. Even with 7,500 sandbags (simulating passengers) piled on one side, and tugboats pulling in that direction, she listed only 12 degrees.<ref name="nyt stability">{{cite news
