==Reception==
{{quote box
|quote="For a ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' special, it delivered what the audience expected... sight gags, humorous dialogue, and laughs. I have to say, I appreciated how 'going back in time' was accomplished in this special. It played a lot better for me than the medieval times special ['[[Dunces and Dragons]]'] (where SpongeBob and Patrick went back in time to the medieval period, but it was never known whether they actually went back in time or it was all a dream). Here, I liked the fact that we went from SpongeBob and Sandy reading the book, to seeing what happened in the past, with Sponge Buck and the ancestors. Going into this, I was almost afraid that the writers would find a way, either for real or through a dream, to actually send SpongeBob back to the Wild West."

The episode received positive reviews from media critics. Paul Mavis of the [[DVD Talk]] said the episode is "a real treat for fans of westerns and spaghetti westerns[...]" because "the writers play off time-honored genre clich<U+00E9>s so well."<ref name=Mavis/> Mavis lauded Plankton's appearance in the episode, saying "Plankton reaches insane levels of hilarity here, brandishing a whip like [[Lash LaRue]] and cracking it at the 'hayseeds' that get in his way."<ref name=Mavis/> He also praised Plankton's voice actor, [[Mr. Lawrence]], on his role, writing "It's a terrific vocal performance by [Mr.] Doug Lawrence (made even more funny during the town's ritualized squashing of villain Dead-Eye, as he screams grotesquely off-camera)."<ref name=Mavis/> Mavis cited his favorite line: "I'll bet you're somebody's famous poop-covered ancestor."<ref name=Mavis/>

Lesley Aeschliman of [[Yahoo!

Roy Hrab of the [[DVD Verdict]] was negative on the DVD, saying "[...]adults will be disappointed further, but, more importantly, I think kids (except for the very young) will be less then impressed.
