'''Helene Rother''' (1908<U+2013>1999) was the first woman to work as an [[automotive design]]er when she joined the interior styling staff of [[General Motors]] in Detroit in 1943.<ref name="AACA">{{cite web |url= http://www.aacamuseum.org/Pdf/WomensHistory.pdf |title=Women's Automotive History Highlights |publisher=AACA Antique Auto Museum |page=3 |accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> She specialized in designs for automotive interiors, as well as [[furniture]], [[jewelry]], [[fashion accessories]], and [[stained glass window]]s.

== Early life ==
A native of [[Leipzig]], Germany, Rother studied art at the Kunstgewerbe School in [[Hamburg]]. She also studied at the [[Bauhaus]] in [[Weimar]]. Rother moved to [[Paris]] and designed of high fashion jewelry, as well as popular little animal pins that women wore on hats and dresses before [[World War II]].<ref name="Krueger">{{cite web |url= http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/jun07.html |last=Krueger |first=Barbara |title=Helene Rother (1908-1999) Windows of the Month for June, 2007 Michigan Stained Glass Census |date=1 June 2007 |publisher=MSU Museum |archivedate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716202856/http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/jun07.html |accessdate=16 April 2013 }}</ref> 

In 1932, Rother gave birth to Ina Ann Rother whose father was active in the [[French Resistance]] and on the run for years.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://old.cvm.msu.edu/documents/Winter08_Perspectives.pdf |journal=Perspectives Magazine |month=Winter |year=2009 |title=The Good Animal |pages=13-15|publisher=College of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University |accessdate=6 April 2013 }}</ref> 

Rother fled from [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied [[France]] together with her seven-year-old daughter Ina, to a [[refugee camp]] in northern Africa where they stayed for four months before finding passage on a ship bound for [[New York City]] in 1941.<ref name="Krueger"/> 

== Career ==
Rother's first employment in New York was as an illustrator for [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=Foster>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2005/07/01/hmn_feature4.html |last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=First Lady of Style |journal=Hemmings Classic Car |month=July |year=2005 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> The following year, she joined the interior styling staff of General Motors in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. She was responsible for upholstery colors and fabrics, lighting, door hardware and seat construction.<ref name="Krueger"/> 

Although she was Detroit's first woman automotive designer, it was downplayed at the time and her salary as reported in a newspaper was [[United States dollar|US$]]600 a month.<ref name=Foster/> At this time the average wage was $200 for a man.<ref name="Wolff">{{cite journal|url= http://local.aaca.org/northcarolina/region/NCRnews/Region%20Newsletters/NC%20Region%20News%202007_5%20Sept-Oct.pdf |last=Wolff |first=Tamsin |title=Women<U+2019>s Automotive History Highlights |pages=12<U+2013>14 |journal=NC Region News |volume=53 |issue=5 |month=September/October |year=2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081209140225/http://local.aaca.org/northcarolina/region/NCRnews/Region%20Newsletters/NC%20Region%20News%202007_5%20Sept-Oct.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> "She was one of the few women to succeed in a man's job during an era when the vast majority of women couldn't even see a glass ceiling-it was hidden behind steel doors."<ref name="halloffame">{{cite journal|url= http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2005/05/01/hmn_feature5.html |last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=Automotive Hall of Fame |journal=Hemmings Classic Car |month=May |year=2005 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref>

In 1947, Rother established her own design studio in the [[Fisher Building]], where she specialized in designs for automotive interiors, furniture, and stained glass windows.<ref name="AACA"/> Her business was named Helene Rother Associates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/newsletters/MSGCnews02.pdf |title=Recent Gifts to the MSU Museum Collection of Stained Glass Artifacts |publisher=The Michigan Stained Glass Census Newsletter |issue=2 |month=November |year=2003 |archivedate=12 February 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070221114420/http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/newsletters/MSGCnews02.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> In 1948 she published a technical paper with the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) asking "Are we doing a good job in our car interiors"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/480146 |last=Rother |first=Helene |title=Are we doing a good job in our car interiors |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers, document 480146 |month=January |year=1948 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> She participated in SAE conferences describing that much can be and should be done in improving automobile interior design and the materials used at that time, summarizing what determines quality in textiles "You get exactly what you pay for."<ref>{{cite journal|publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers. Detroit Section |year=1949 |journal=The Supercharger |title=The November 15th Dinner Meeting |first=George T. |last=Christianson |page=55 }}</ref>

In 1949, ''The SAE Journal'' reported on Rother's work and her activities advocating women in the industry. They described her "efforts have encompassed items ranging from jewelry and accessories to several of today's automobiles, and quoted her that "even the Army is ahead of industry in employing the talents of women."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The SAE Journal |page=70 |title=Are we doing a good job |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |year=1949 |volume=57 }}</ref>

She was soon contracted by [[Nash Motors]] and styled the elegant interiors of most of the cars from 1948 to 1956.<ref name="Wolff"/> Even the economical [[Nash Rambler]] models were prominently promoted as "irresistible glamour" on wheels. The innovative 100-inch wheelbase Rambler was conceived initially as a well-appointed convertible with its interior designed with the aid of Rother as a consultant.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2EFWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Helene+Rother%22 |journal=Automobile Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=2 |title=Refrigerators and Two Georges: from Nash-Kelvibator to American Motors |first=Sam |last=Medway |pages=140<U+2013>159 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> Nash used a strategy to give the new Rambler a positive public image by avoiding it being seen by the public as a "cheap little car."

Rother designed the Rambler's interiors to appeal to the feminine eye knew because she knew what women looked for in a car and her designs featured elegant, stylish, and expensive fabrics that coordinated in colors and trim.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1950-1952-rambler2.htm |title=1950-1952 Rambler |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=28 August 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> The new 1951 Rambler models were also "given the custom touch" with fabrics and colors selected by Rother that "equaled the best of interiors in American luxury cars of the period."<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=m-k3ONS880cC&pg=PA444&dq=Helene+Rother |title=American cars, 1946-1959: every model, year by year |first=J.

She toured the 1951 [[Mondial de l'Automobile|Paris Auto Salon]], and was the first woman to address the Society of Automotive Engineers in Detroit.<ref name="Wolff"/> In 1953, Nash was awarded the Jackson Medal, "...since 1898, one of America's most sought-after awards," according to an advertisement, for excellence of design.<ref name=Foster/> Many Nash sales brochures and Rambler advertisements of the time featured the copy stating: "Styling by [[Battista Farina|Pinin Farina]] and interiors by Madame Helene Rother of Paris" as proof of the European influence on company's automobile styling.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YFYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=Built+for+you+Helene+Rother |page=41 |title=As though it were built for you alone |journal=Life |date=4 August 1952 |volume=33 |issue=5 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.adclassix.com/ads2/54nashairflytes.htm |title=1954 Nash Airflytes advertisement |publisher=adclassix.com |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> She conferred with Pinin Farina, who styled the exterior of the 1953 Nash Airflytes, to coordinate with the interiors and new custom fabrics.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=HYonAAAAMAAJ&q=Helene+Rother&dq=Helene+Rother |page=15 |title=Nash Cars |journal=Motor |volume=99 |year=1953 |publisher=Hearst |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> In 1954 the Nash Ambassadors had a big feature: the completely new interior by Rother.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1952-1954-nash-ambassador-and-statesman4.htm |title=1954 Nash |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> That year, Nash merged with [[Hudson Motors|Hudson]] to create [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), but her influence on interior fashion in automobiles continued.

== Other work ==
She purchased a home on Chicago Boulevard, with a studio downstairs and living quarters upstairs, and continued other independent [[Consultant|consulting]] work.<ref name="Krueger"/> Her clients included several [[tire]] manufacturing companies, as well as non-automotive firms. She was also responsible for designing the interiors of [[ambulance]]s and [[hearse]]s for [[Wayne Corporation|Miller-Meteor]].<ref name=Foster/>

A sterling flatware pattern called "Skylark" was designed by Rother for Samuel Kirk & Son, silver craftsmen since 1815, and the company issued from 1954 into the late-1980s.<ref>{{cite book|journal=Jewelers' Circular |title=Keystone Jewelers' Directory Issue |page=83 |publisher=Chilton's |year=1954 }}</ref> The Skylark brand and logo expired in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/skylark-71672741.html |title=Brand page for the SKYLARK trademark by Samuel Kirk & Son |publisher=trademarkia.com |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref>

Rother decided she wanted to begin producing art again and she went for a visit to Europe where she saw the struggle to restore or rebuild war-damaged churches and cathedrals. She also designed [[stained glass]] for American churches and had installations in the mid-1960s, mainly in Michigan,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.michiganstainedglass.org/collections/studiosartist.php?id=17-82-3A |title=Artist: Rother, Helene |publisher=Michigan Stained Glass Census |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}</ref> such as the Beverly Hills United Methodist Church in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan|Beverly Hills]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/feb03.html |title=Beverly Hills United Methodist Church: Window of the Month |month=February |year=2003 |publisher=MSU Library Michigan Stained Glass Census |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081012001712/http://museum.msu.edu/museum/msgc/feb03.html|archivedate=12 February 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> and the St. [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] Cathedral in northeast Detroit with all thick "chunk" faceted glass, that was fabricated in France.<ref name="Krueger"/> In 1962, the St. James United Church of Christ in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], was dedicated featuring windows and the [[reredos]] designed by Rother.<ref name="StJames">{{cite book|title=Sanctuary Dedication Program |publisher=St. James United Church of Christ |location=Dearborn, Michigan |year=1962|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=pOLhAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Helene+Rother%22&dq=%22Helene+Rother%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3vPyUKf0F4X28wSBvIGwCw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDgU |page=15 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> The glass was selected and fabricated into small pieces by a family group of craftsmen in Buche, a suburb of Paris, before being shipped from France for final assembly during the construction.<ref name="StJames"/>

Rother remains relatively unknown in the world of stained glass as women who designed stained glass, either independently or under a major studio name, were for the most part unrecognized at the time.<ref name="Krueger"/> 

In her later years, Rother designed large stained glass windows for churches and spent time on her [[Horse breeding|horse]] [[farm]] near [[Metamora, Michigan]].<ref name="AACA"/>

==Legacy==
In 1953, ''Tide'', a magazine covering the sales and advertising industry and trends, wrote: "a most attractive woman, whom I have thus encountered along the periphery of advertising is Madam Helene Rother <U+2014> pretty and vivacious enough to serve as a prototype of Parisian women. She is an industrial designer with an impressive record."<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=BPYCvv13bXkC&q=%22Helene+Rother%22 |title=Surplus Obfuscation |year=1953 |page=34 |journal=Tide |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}</ref> 

According to automotive historian Patrick Foster, Rother is one of the important people in the automotive industry who have been overlooked or forgotten.<ref name="halloffame"/> She was not the first woman to work in styling; however, "she was an early pioneer and one of the best."<ref name="halloffame"/>
