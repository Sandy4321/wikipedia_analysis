'''Cezmi Kartay''' (1920, <U+0130>zmit-2008, <U+0130>zmit) was a Turkish civil servant and politician.
==Early life==
He studied political sciences in [[Ankara University]]. He served as a district governor ([[Kaymakam]]) in the districts of [[Kemaliye]], [[Akyaz<U+0131>]], [[<U+00C7>ermik]] and [[Baskil]]. After 1960, he was appointed as the province goveror ([[Vali]]) of [[Malatya Province|Malatya]], [[Tekirda<U+011F>|Tekirda<U+011F>]] and [[Gaziantep Province]]s.

==Kartay and CHP==
After the coup of 1980, the activities of [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People<U+2019>s Party]] ({{Lang-tr|Cumhuriyet Halk Patisi (CHP)}} which is usually credited as the founder of Turkish republic in 1923 were suspended by the miltary rule so called [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] or {{lang-tr|MGK}}). But the party was not closed and Cezmi Kartay was appointed as the trustee of the party. On 16 October 1981 however, the party (like other parties) was closed by MGK.

==Kartay and SODEP==
After a year and half, MGK decided to allow the formation of new parties with severe restrictions. According to instructions, the new parties were not allowed to use the names of the former parties and senior politicians were not allowed to be the charter member of the new parties. Furthermore, MGK had the power of rejecting the founders. This gave MGK a privilege to limit the number of parties that would attend the coming parliamentary elections.
One of the new parties was [[SODEP]] which was founded by the followers of ex-CHP. The chairman of the party was [[Erdal <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] an eminent physics professor (and also the son of [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]], the second presedent of Turkey). Cezmi Kartay was also a charter member of the party.<ref>Erdal <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>:An<U+0131>lar ve D<U+00FC><U+015F><U+00FC>nceler 2, Yorum Kitaplar<U+0131>, <U+0130>stanbul,1998, ISBN 975-7119-06-7, pg.307</ref> But when <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC><U+2019>s name was rejected by MGK on 23 June 1983, Cezmi Kartay (whose name was not rejected)  was elected as the chairman of the party. Cezmi Kartay<U+2019>s term was short. On 17 December 1983, following the general elections Cezmi Kartay resigned and Erdal <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC> was reelected as the chairman. But Cezmi Kartay continued as a vice chairman
==Later years==
Two years later SODEP was merged to another part to form [[Social Democratic Populist Party (Turkey)|Social Democrat People's Party]] ({{lang-tr|Sosyal Demokrat Halk<U+00E7><U+0131> Parti}}).  In SHP also, Cezmi Kartay  served as a vice chairman for one term. In later years he didn<U+2019>t participate in active politics.
