'''Dover Athletic Football Club''' is an [[football (soccer)|association football]] team based in the town of [[Dover]], [[Kent]], [[England]], who play in the [[Isthmian League Division One South]].  The club was formed in 1983 after the dissolution of the town's previous club, [[Dover F.C.]], whose place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] was taken by the new club.  In the [[1989-90 in English football|1989&ndash;90]] season Dover Athletic won the Southern League championship, but failed to gain promotion to the [[Football Conference]] as the club's ground did not meet the required standard.  Three seasons later the team won this title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated.

The team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the Whites. They have played at the Crabble Stadium since the club's formation.  As the result of a sponsorship deal the stadium is currently known officially as the SeaFrance Crabble Stadium.  The club's best performance in the [[FA Cup]] was an appearance in the first round proper in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03]] season, while the best performance registered in the [[FA Trophy]], the national competition for higher-level [[Non-league football|non-league]] clubs, was a run to the semi-finals in the [[1997-98 in English football|1997&ndash;98]] season.

==History==
Dover Athletic F.C. was formed in 1983 after the town's previous club, [[Dover F.C.]], folded due to its debts.  The new club took Dover's place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Southern Division,<ref name="Cr2" /> with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club.<ref name="Husk" />  Initially Athletic struggled, finishing second from bottom of the table in the [[1984-85 in English football|1984&ndash;85]] season.<ref name="Husk" /><ref name="RSSSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engsouthernleaghist.html|title=England - Southern League Final Tables|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2005-07-04}}</ref>  In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.<ref name="Husk" />

Under Kinnear the club's fortunes turned round, with two top-five finishes followed by the Southern Division championship, and with it promotion, in the [[1987-88 in English football|1987&ndash;88]] season.<ref name="RSSSF" />  The team started strongly in the [[Southern League Premier Division|Premier Division]], finishing in sixth place at the first attempt, and then winning the championship in the [[1989-90 in English football|1989&ndash;90]] season.<ref name="FCHD" />  The club was denied promotion to the [[Football Conference]], however, as The Crabble did not meet the standard required for that league.<ref name="Cr2" />  After finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two seasons, Dover won the title again in the [[1992-93 in English football|1992&ndash;93]] season and this time were admitted to the Conference.<ref name="FCHD" />

Although Dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the Conference,<ref name="Conf1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/conf/conf1994.htm|title=Football Conference 1993&ndash;94|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> the following season saw the club struggling against relegation, and Kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team's poor performances and his own personal problems.<ref name="Husk" /><ref name="CK" />  [[John Ryan (English footballer)|John Ryan]] was appointed as the club's new manager,<ref name="Ryan1" /> but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club lost seven of its first eight matches in the [[1995-96 in English football|1995&ndash;96]] season.<ref name="Ryan2" />  The club then appointed former [[England national football team|England]] international [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] as manager, but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto their place in the Conference only because [[Northern Premier League]] runners-up [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline.<ref name="Ryan2" />

[[Bill Williams (English footballer)|Bill Williams]] took over as manager in 1997 and proved to be Dover's most successful Conference manager, leading the club to the [[FA Trophy]] semi-finals in the [[1997-98 in English football|1997&ndash;98]] season and a best ever league finish of sixth place in the [[1999-00 in English football|1999&ndash;2000]] season.<ref name="FCHD" /><ref name="UB" />  Williams left the club to take a senior position with Conference rivals [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] in May 2001.<ref name="UB">{{cite web|url=http://www.doverathletic.com/index.php?p=news&id=149|title=Bill Williams Resigns|publisher=Dover Athletic F.C.|accessdate=2008-02-05|date=2001-05-14}}</ref>  By now the club was in severe financial difficulties, with a number of directors resigning and debts exceeding <U+00A3>100,000.

Dover Athletic continued to make improvements to the ground, although not in time to allow the club to take its place in the [[Football Conference]] in 1990.  Subsequently new turnstiles were installed and two new terraces and a second grandstand added.
