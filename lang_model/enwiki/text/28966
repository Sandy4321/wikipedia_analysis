The '''Commonwealth of Virginia''' ({{Audio-IPA|en-us-Virginia.ogg|/v<U+0259>r<U+02C8>d<U+0292><U+026A>nj<U+0259>/|help=no}}) is a [[U.S. state]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of the [[Southern United States]]. Virginia is nicknamed the "Old Dominion" and sometimes the "Mother of Presidents" because it is the birthplace of [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state|eight U.S. presidents]]. The geography and climate of the state are shaped by the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which are home to much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] is the most populous city and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] the most populous political subdivision. The state population is nearly eight million.<ref name=demographics/>

The area's history begins with indigenous settlements, and the founding of the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in 1607 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]] as the first permanent [[New World]] English colony. Land from displaced Native American tribes, including the [[Powhatan]], and slave labor each played significant roles in Virginia's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in the [[American Revolution]] and joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]], during which Richmond was the Confederate capital and the state of [[West Virginia]] separated. Although traditionally conservative and historically part of the South, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.<ref name=purple/>

The state government, home to the oldest legislature in the Americas, has been repeatedly ranked most effective by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]].<ref name=pew/> It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its Governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in places like the [[Shenandoah Valley]]; federal agencies in [[Northern Virginia]], including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]; and military facilities in [[Hampton Roads]], home to the [[Virginia Port Authority|region's main seaport]]. The growth of the media and technology sectors have made [[integrated circuit|computer chips]] the state's leading export, with the industry based on the strength of Virginia's public schools and [[List of colleges and universities in Virginia|universities]].<ref name=chips/> Virginia does not have a major professional sports franchise, but is home to several prominent collegiate sports programs.

Due to a peculiarity of Virginia's original charter, its boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. does not extend past the low-water mark of the south shore of the [[Potomac River]] (unlike many boundaries that split a river down the middle).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/orgs/SGLC/National/SandBar/2.4supreme.htm|title=Supreme Court Rules for Virginia in Potomac Conflict|work=The Sea Grant Law Center|publisher=[[University of Mississippi]]|year=2003|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}</ref> The southern border is defined as the [[36<U+00B0>30' parallel north|36<U+00B0>&nbsp;30<U+2032> parallel north]], though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three [[arcminute]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hubbard, Jr.|2009|p=140}}</ref>

The [[Native American tribes in Virginia|first people]] arrived in Virginia about 5,000&nbsp;years ago, and farming began there by 900 CE. By 1500, the Virginia [[Algonquian peoples]] had founded towns such as [[Werowocomoco]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]], which they referred to as ''[[Tsenacommacah]]''. The other major language groups in the area were the [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] to the west, and the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoians]], who included the [[Nottoway Tribe|Nottoway]] and [[Meherrin]], to the north and south.

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament's]] efforts to levy new taxes following the [[French and Indian War]] (1754<U+2013>1763) were deeply unpopular in the colonies.

When the [[American Revolutionary War]] began, [[George Washington]], who had commanded Virginia's forces in the French and Indian War, was selected to head the [[Continental Army|colonial army]].

[[Image:Virginia Civil Rights Memorial wide.jpg|thumb|The [[Virginia Civil Rights Memorial]] was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation.|alt=Bronze sculptures of seven figures marching stand around a large rectangular block of white engraved granite.]]
Protests started by [[Barbara Rose Johns]] in 1951 in [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] against segregated schools led to the lawsuit ''[[Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]''. This case, filed by Richmond natives [[Spottswood William Robinson III|Spottswood Robinson]] and [[Oliver Hill]], was decided in 1954 with ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]". However in 1958, under the policy of "[[massive resistance]]" spearheaded by the powerful segregationist Senator [[Harry F.

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] gained many participants in the 1960s and achieved the moral force to gain national legislation for protection of [[suffrage]] and civil rights for African Americans.

In colonial Virginia, free men elected the lower house of the legislature, called the [[House of Burgesses]], which together with the Governor's Council, made the "General Assembly". Founded in 1619, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] is still in existence as the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=burgesses>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/06/AR2006050601099_pf.html|title=Latest Budget Standoff Met With Shrugs|first1=Rosalind S.|last1=Helderman|first2=Chris L.|last2=Jenkins|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 7, 2006|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}</ref> The modern government is ranked by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]] with an A<U+2212> in terms of its efficiency, effectiveness, infrastructure.

Since 1971, the government has functioned under the seventh [[Constitution of Virginia]], which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal structure]], the government is divided in [[Separation of powers|three branches]]: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]], a bicameral body whose 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. The Governor and [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] are elected every four years in separate elections. Incumbent [[List of Virginia Governors|governors]] cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] can.<ref name=constitution>{{cite journal|title=Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia by A.

In the last century Virginia has shifted from a largely rural, [[Politics of the Southern United States|politically Southern]] and conservative state to a more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate environment.

==State symbols==
{{Main|List of Virginia state symbols}}
[[Image:Virginia sign.JPG|thumb|The Virginia welcome sign on [[State Route 32 (Virginia)|State Route 32]] employs the state bird, the [[Northern Cardinal|cardinal]], and the state tree and flower, the [[Cornus florida|dogwood]].|alt=A blue sign with the phrase "Welcome to Virginia" stands next to a small road. A red cardinal on a pink dogwood tree branch graces the upper-right corner of the sign.]]
The state nickname is the oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "[[Dominion]]" by King [[Charles II of England]] at the time of [[The Restoration]], because it had remained loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title.
