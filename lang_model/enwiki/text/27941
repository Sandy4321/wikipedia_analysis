'''Andr<U+00E9>s Alejandro Palomeque Gonz<U+00E1>lez'''<ref name="Ovacinones21536"/> (July 1, 1971 <U+2013> March 22, 2009) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Lucha libre|Luchador]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "masked [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]"). He is best known for appearing under the [[ring name|stage name]] '''Abismo Negro''', which is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Black Abyss" or "[[black hole]]", in the [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] (AAA) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. Before appearing under the ring name Abismo Negro, Palomeque worked for five years under the alias "[the] Winners" and before that also wrestled as the characters "Alex Dinamo", "Peque<U+00F1>o Samurai", and "Furor" for short periods. Palomeque owned and operated the ''Gimnasio Abismo Negro'', a wrestling school where individuals were trained to become professional wrestlers.

In his professional wrestling career, Palomeque worked for the two most prominent professional wrestling promotions in Mexico: [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) and AAA. He also worked for the North American-based promotions the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) due to talent exchange programs between AAA and WWF in 1997 and TNA in 2004, as well as making appearances for the [[Michinoku Pro]] and [[Pro Wrestling NOAH]] promotions in [[Japan]]

On March 22, 2009, Palomeque was found dead in a river near [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], [[Sinaloa]]; the official cause of death was listed as drowning. On the night before, a wrestler using the Abismo Negro outfit worked an AAA show pretending to be Palomeque; this incident caused the promoter to be barred from promoting shows for two years.

==Early life==
Andr<U+00E9>s Alejandro Palomeque Gonz<U+00E1>lez was born July 1, 1971 in [[Villahermosa, Tabasco]], [[Mexico]]. Palomeque started to get interested in professional wrestling at the age of nine when his father, Juan Francisco Palomeque Torres, took him to his first wrestling event. Later the Palomeque Family moved to Poza Rica where a young Palomeque took up [[Pentathlon#High School/Secondary School Pentathlon|Pentathlon]] ([[long jump]], [[high jump]],  110 metres [[hurdling|hurdles run]], [[shot put]], 1500 metres run) in school.<ref name=SL308/><ref name="NoruegoInterview"/> He and his brother, C<U+00E9>sar Palomeque, had an interest in Martial Arts and trained together for years.<ref name=DosdeTres>{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/especial-abismo-negro.html | title=El material in<U+00E9>dito de Abismo Negro | author= ''Dos de Tres'' Staff | date=May 14, 2009 | accessdate= July 16, 2009 | publisher= AAA | language=Spanish}}</ref> When Palomeque was thirteen years old he began working in a gymnasium where professional wrestlers were trained, initially he paid for the use of the gymnasium by cleaning it after hours. When the family moved back to the Tabasco region he began training under Don Nerio Soto, who worked under the ring name ''El Noruego'' (the [[Norway|Norwegian]]), and his brother Delio Soto to become a luchador, or professional wrestler. Professional wrestlers perform in in a non-competitive sport based on simulated fighting with storylines written by creative teams and matches with predetermined results. Don Soto later recollects how he and his family took the young man in and made him part of their family, practically adopting him while he was enrolled in Soto's wrestling school and later as he worked on the local [[Independent circuit|wrestling circuit]].<ref name=SL308/><ref name="NoruegoInterview"/> Palomeue made his professional wrestling debut in 1987, at the age of 16, under the ring name "Alex Dinamo".<ref name="NoruegoInterview"/>

==Professional wrestling career==
Palomeque received further training from famous Mexican wrestling coaches [[Diablo Velasco]] and [[Ray Mendoza]] before changing his character and ring name to "Peque<U+00F1>o Samurai"&mdash;a masked persona patterned after the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[Samurai]] tradition. In 1991, Palomeque began working for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL; Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"), the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at that time. In CMLL, he worked as Furor, another masked ring persona.<ref name=SL308/><ref Name="SLObit">{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/?p=19963 |title=Recordando a Abismo Negro: Su vida y legado en los cuadril<U+00E1>teros | accessdate=March 24, 2009 | date= March 23, 2009 |publisher= SuperLuchas.net | language= Spanish}}</ref> While working as Furor, Palomeque won his first ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de apuestas|Luchas de apuestas]]'', or "bet match" when he defeated his mentor El Noruego in a match where Noruego's hair and Palomeque's mask was at stake.<ref name="AAABio"/>

===Winners===
In 1992 CMLL head [[Booker (professional wrestling)|writer]] [[Antonio Pe<U+00F1>a]] left the company to create his own wrestling promotion [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] (AAA; Spanish for "Assistance, Consulting and Administration") promotion; Palomeque was one of the many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA.<ref name=SL308/> In AAA, his ring personal was changed and he became "Winners" (sometimes written Winner's), a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] character (known as a ''T<U+00E9>cnico'' in Lucha Libre) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask.<ref Name="SLObit"/> Palomeques work as "Winners" earned him a match on the the very first [[Tripleman<U+00ED>a#TripleMania I|TripleMan<U+00ED>a]] where he teamed with [[Rafael Garc<U+00ED>a|Super Cal<U+00F3>]] and El Salsero to defeat the team of May Flowers, Rudy Reyna, and Baby Sharon in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Six Man Tag Team match]].<ref name="Trip1">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#i |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania |accessdate= February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> The following year at [[Tripleman<U+00ED>a#TripleMania II-A|TripleMania II-A]] he teamed up with [[Rey Misterio, Sr.|Rey Misterio]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat the team known as ''Los Destructores'' (Tony Arce, Vulcano, and Rocco Valente).<ref name="Trip2">{{cite web| url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingInternational/triplemania.html | title = TripleMania: Mexico's answer to WrestleMania | accessdate = 2008-06-16 | date = [[2000-07-05]]| publisher = ''SLAM!

Winners team won the match, keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match.

===Abismo Negro===
In January 1997, Palomeque's character was changed from that of the quintessential heroic ladies' man known as "Winners", to that of a cheating [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] (referred to as a ''Rudo'') known as "Abismo Negro". Part of his new routine as Abismo Negro was a flamethrower display, created by using a lighter and an [[Aerosol spray]] can.<ref name=SL308/> Palomeque would regularly use this during his entrance and on occasion during a match as when he worked as "Abismo Negro" character. As part of his Rudo act Palomeque began using the ''Marinete'' &mdash; a wrestling move known as a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|Piledriver]] where he simulates driving the top of his opponents' head into the mat &mdash; the Marinete is "banned" Mexican wrestling, which means that it can lead to a disqualification if used during the match. The Marinete became such a signature move for the Abismo Negro character that he earned the nickname ''El Rey del Martinete'' (The King of the Piledriver).<ref name="Ovacinones21536"/> He made his debut as Abismo Negro on January 10, 1997 in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Eight Man Tag Team match]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-debut.html |title=El Debut de Abismo Negro | accessdate=March 28, 2009 |date=March 26, 2009 | publisher= [[Asistencia Asesor<U+00ED>a y Administraci<U+00F3>n]] |language=Spanish}}</ref> Shortly after his debut as Abismo Negro, he made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) debut on the January 19, 1997 episode of the [[WWE Free for All|WWF Free For All]] [[pay-per-view]] [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] pre<U+2013>show before the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]]. On the telecast, Negro teamed with [[Erick Casas|Heavy Metal]] and [[Super Crazy|Histeria]] in a losing effort against the team of [[Octag<U+00F3>n]], [[Blue Demon, Jr.]], and Tinieblas Jr in a Six Man Tag Team match.<ref>{{cite news | author = Martin, Fin | title = Back on Top (Royal Rumble 1997) | work =Power Slam Magazine | id=32 | location = England | pages =  12-15 | date =  March, 1997 | accessdate =  July 21, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Figurefour">{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/8736/ | title= This is one bad week for the wrestling business | accessdate= July 15, 2009 | publisher=Wrestling Observer / Figure Four Online}}</ref><ref name="OWW results">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble97.html |title=Royal Rumble 1997 Results |accessdate=February 4, 2008 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> This match was one of the early results of a working relationship between the WWF and AAA that had been created in late 1996.<ref Name="SLObit"/> The relationship saw Negro make an appearance in January against [[Perro Aguayo, Jr.]] and two appearances on the WWF's primary television program ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' in March 1997.<ref name=SL308/> During his appearances in March, Negro was announced as being part of [[Los Vipers]], a recently created alliance of wrestlers.<ref name=SL308/> After March, Negro did not make any more appearances for the WWF. 

In AAA, [[Cibern<U+00E9>tico]] formed Los Vipers with Negro along with Psicosis (II), Mosco De La Merced, Maniaco and Histeria. Histeria was replaced a few weeks later by Histeria II. In 1998, Negro acquired a "mascot": a [[Midget professional wrestling |midget wrestler]] called Mini Abismo Negro.<ref name=SL308/> Abismo, Mini Abismo, and new Vipers member [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]] were defeated by Octag<U+00F3>n, his mascot Octag<U+00F3>ncito, and Pentag<U+00F3>n in a Six man Tag Team match at [[Triplemania#Triplemania VI|TripleMania VI]].<ref name="Trip6">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#vi |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups, such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los Payasos. They also had a long-running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos<U+2014>consisting of Espiritu, Picudo, Nygma, May Flowers, and Silver Cat during the rivalry&mdash;over the [[Mexican National At<U+00F3>micos Championship]]. Los Vipers won the At<U+00F3>micos titles from Los Vatos on several occasions, but Negro was not part of the teams that won. Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentag<U+00F3>n on May 19, 1998 to win the [[Mexican National Middleweight Championship]], a title he held until January 1999.<ref name="BookMiddle">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter=MEXICO: National Middleweight Championship |page=392 |year=2000 |id=ISBN 0-9698161-5-4}}</ref><ref name="MexMiddle"> {{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/mexico/mex-m.html |title=Comision de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F.

In 1999, Los Vipers split into two factions, with Abismo Negro leading a splinter group called ''Los Vipers Extreme'' consisting of Electroshock, Pentag<U+00F3>n, Shiiba, [[Dark Cuervo|El Cuervo]] and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibern<U+00E9>tico created a group called ''Los Vipers Primera Clase'' (First Class Vipers). After less than two months, the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] was dropped and Los Vipers reunited. Not long after Los Vipers reunited, Cibern<U+00E9>tico formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].<ref name=SL308/> Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers.<ref name=SL308/> On May 2, 1999, Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat [[Perro Aguayo]] and Perro Aguayo, Jr. to win the [[Mexican National Tag Team Championship]]. Los Vipers held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther.<ref name="BookMexTag">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | chapter=MEXICO: National Tag Team Titles |pages=396-397 |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |year=2000 |id=ISBN 0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref><ref name="MexTag">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/mexico/mex-t.html |title= Comision de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F.

In 2000, Palomeque participated in a AAA tour of [[Japan]] and competed at [[Triplemania#TripleMania VIII|TripleMania VIII]], where he was on the losing side of an eight-man tag team match main event; Negro teamed with Cibernetico, [[Nobuhiko Oshima|Shiima Nobunaga]] and Electro Shock against Octag<U+00F3>n, [[Jushin Liger]], [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]] and Cuije.<ref name="Trip8">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/triple.html#viii |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion TripleMania |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> While touring with AAA, Palomeuqe also made an appearance at [[Michinoku Pro]]'s April 9 Sumo Hall card, where he defeated El Oriental.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/japan/lucha/mich/michcard.html#0400 |title=Michinoku Pro Shows |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> On May 7, Abismo Negro and Electroshock regained the Mexican National Tag Team title by defeating Haytor and the Panther but only held on to the title for two months before losing it to [[H<U+00E9>ctor Garza]] and Perro Aguayo, Jr.<ref name="MexTag"/>

Negro became one of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Pe<U+00F1>a and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top T<U+00E9>cnicos of AAA such as La Parka (AAA version), Octag<U+00F3>n and [[Latin Lover (wrestler)|Latin Lover]]. Negro's position as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000 when he competed in AAA's annual [[Rey de Reyes#Rey de Reyes 2000|Rey de Reyes]] tournament. In the opening round, he defeated [[Dos Caras]], Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated [[El Alebrije (wrestler)|El Alebrije]], [[Charly Manson]] and Cibern<U+00E9>tico to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament.<ref name="Rey2000">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2000 |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes 2000 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibern<U+00E9>tico and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers.

===Return to AAA===
After the World X Cup tournament ended, Negro returned to AAA full time taking full charge of Los Vipers.<ref name=SL308/> In early 2005, he was once again involved in the final match of that year's [[Rey de Reyes#Rey de Reyes 2005|Rey de Reyes]], but La Parka, Jr. defeated him for the third time.<ref name="Rey2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2005 |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes Tournament |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> AAA hinted at a possible T<U+00E9>cnico [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turn]] when Negro, along with Psicosis and Mini Psicosis, attacked Cibern<U+00E9>tico. The two faced off in a cage match, won by Cibern<U+00E9>tico, but they eventually reconciled their differences once more. At some point after 2005 Abismo Negro won the hair of Stuka, Jr. in a Lucha del reves match.<ref name="AAABio"/> Despite rumors that he was jumping to [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|CMLL]], Negro remained in AAA and was sent on a tour with [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] in the spring of 2006.<ref Name="SLObit"/> Later in the year, he finally turned T<U+00E9>cnico and began a sustained storyline with [[Cibern<U+00E9>tico]] and his group [[Secta De Mesias#La Secta Cibernetica|La Secta Cibernetica]].<ref name="Titanes2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/guerra.html#2005 |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Guerra de Titanes |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> The on again, off again storyline with Cibern<U+00E9>tico was put on hold when Cibern<U+00E9>tico suffered a severe knee injury in late 2006.<ref name=SL308/> At some point during 2006, Los Vipers left La Legi<U+00F3>n due to their "Anti-Mexican" philosophy and began fighting La Legi<U+00F3>n and La Legi<U+00F3>n's imported wrestlers. At [[Verano de Escandalo#Verano de Escandalo 2006|Verano de Escandalo 2006]], Negro, Charly Manson, Electroshock and Histeria lost to Team TNA ([[Nelson Erazo|Homicide]], [[Brandon Silvestry|Low-Ki]], [[Samoa Joe]] and [[A.J.

===Black Abyss===
In late 2007, AAA created a ring persona for a new wrestler called Black Abyss; the gimmick featured the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well. Initially, it was believed that this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-shows]].<ref name=SL308/> In 2008, Negro's "almost winning" streak at [[Rey de Reyes#Rey de Reyes 2008|Rey de Reyes]] continued as he lost in the final to [[El Zorro (wrestler)|El Zorro]]. Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro's behalf during the match, furthering the storyline between the two.<ref name="Rey2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#2008 |title=Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes Tournament |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ProWrestlingHistory.com}}</ref> During the fall of 2008, AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss "injure" Negro with his own trademark move the "Martinete".<ref name=SL308/> Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in [[Tripleman<U+00ED>a#TripleMania XVI|TripleMania XVI]] in a match where he would face Los Vipers (Psicosis, Histeria, Black Abyss and [[Mr. Niebla]] in a cage match, but in the weeks leading up to the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled, AAA used the atack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place.<ref name=NoTM/> At the 2008 [[Guerra de Titanes#Guerra de Titanes 2008|Guerra de Titanes]], Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/abismo-negro-reaparece-en-xalapa.html |title=En Xalapa y Evento Grabado para la TV Reaparece Abismo Negro  |accessdate=March 4, 2009 |language=Spanish |publisher=luchalibreAAA.com}}</ref> Subsequently, the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two, with their masks on the line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/rivalidad-abismo-negro-black-abyss.html |title=En Cuautla Abismo Negro VS.

Palomeque's wife has been suffering from [[breast cancer]] for a number of years.<ref name="Wake"/><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172497 | title= Expediente Abismo Negro: Habla la ex amante | author= Redacci<U+00F3>n | publisher= TabascoHoy.com| date= April 1, 2009 | accessdate= April 2, 2009 | language= Spanish}}</ref>

He often appeared on the morning television program ''Vida TV'', in full wrestling gear and persona, billed as Abismo Negro. He usually appeared as a kind of judge for talent contests on the show earning him the nickname ''Fiscal De Hierro de la Televisi<U+00F3>n'' (the Iron Judge of Television).<ref Name="SLObit"/> Palomeque owned and operated "Gimnasio Abismo Negro" where he taught both professional wrestling and physical fitness.

==Death==
Palomeque was found dead on March 22, 2009. His body was found in a river near the town of [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], [[Sinaloa]]. According to a bus driver who was transporting Palomeque and other passengers to [[Mexico City]] on Friday night March 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A [[text message]] he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of March 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jes<U+00FA>s Enrique Castro L<U+00F3>pez stated that such an [[anxiety attack]] could be [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed.<ref name="DeathNoroeste"/> An autopsy was carried out on March 23, which determined that the cause of death was drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned.<ref name="Autopsy">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabascohoy.com/nota.php?id_nota=172134 |title=Abismo negro <U+00A1>Muri<U+00F3> ahogado! |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |date= March 24, 2009 |publisher= Tabasco Hoy |language=Spanish}}</ref> A memorial was held in Mexico City on March 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque.<ref name="Wake">{{cite web |url=http://superluchas.net/?p=20141 |title=Hoy ser<U+00E1> velado Abismo Negro en la colonia San Angel de la Ciudad de M<U+00E9>xico |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=SuperLuchas.net| language=Spanish}}</ref> His body was subsequently [[cremation|cremated]], with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.<ref name=SL308/>

On Saturday March 21, while Palomeque was either lost in the hills or already dead, someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in [[Cancun]]. In the past, the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show, but this time Black Abyss was not the man behind the mask, as he was on the opposing team that night. Following the discovery of Palomeque's body, the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show, Ren<U+00E1>n Mart<U+00ED>nez, was suspended for two years by the Benito J<U+00FA>arez Boxing and Wrestling commission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://superluchas.net/?p=21047 |title=<U+00BF>Veto por dos a<U+00F1>os, al promotor y a la AAA por el aparente fraude de Abismo Negro en Canc<U+00FA>n? |author=Jorge Ocampo Alcazar |publisher=SuperLuchas.net |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=4&schid=1037&secid=0&cid=1893827 |title=Suplantaron a 'Abismo' el d<U+00ED>a que muri<U+00F3>: Comisi<U+00F3>n de box y lucha investiga |author=Notimex |publisher= univision |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2009 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

On May 26, 2009 AAA held the ''Torneo Abismo Negro'' in honor of Palomeque, the tournament was a 7 man [[Gauntlet for the Gold|gauntlet]]-style match and included a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students.
