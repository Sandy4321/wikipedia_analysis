'''''Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co.''''', 282 U.S. 359 (1931), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court dealing with accounting for purposes of [[federal income tax]] and the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  The case held that an annual accounting system is a practical necessity if the federal income tax is to produce revenue ascertainable and payable at regular intervals.

The case was decided at a time when losses could not be carried forward to future years.  Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code now generally allows losses to be carried back 3 years and forward 20 years.
