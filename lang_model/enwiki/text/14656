'''Madurai''' is the administrative headquarters of [[Madurai District]] in the [[South India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is the third largest city and the third largest municipal corporation in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Tamil N<U+0101>du <U+2013> City Population <U+2013> Cities, Towns & Provinces <U+2013> Statistics & Map|2011}} Located on the banks of [[River Vaigai]], it has been a major settlement for two millennia and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.{{sfn|Madurai Districts}}

Madurai is closely associated with the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language as all the 3 primary congregation of Tamil scholars, the Tamil Sangam (3rd century BC to 3rd century CE), were held in the city. The recorded history of the city goes back to the 3rd century BC, mentioned by [[Megasthenes]] (350 <U+2013> 290 BC), the Greek ambassador to India, and [[Kautilya]] (370<U+2013>283 BC), the minister of the Mauryan Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (born 340 BC, ruled 320 <U+2013> 298 BC). The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled, at different times, by the [[Early Pandyan Kingdom|Early Pandyas]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], Later Pandyas, [[Madurai Sultanate|Ma'bar Sultanate]], Madurai Sultanate, [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Madurai Nayaks]], [[Chanda Sahib]], [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic kingdom]], and the [[British Raj|British]]. The city has a number of historical monuments, the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] and [[Tirumalai Nayak Palace]] being the most prominent among them. The city celebrates several festivals, the most important being the annual 10 day Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival (also called Chittirai festival), celebrated during April<U+2013>May, that attracts 1 million visitors. Madurai is also known for [[Jallikattu]], the annual bull taming event celebrated along with the [[Thai Pongal]] festival, organised in villages outside the city.

Madurai is an important industrial and educational hub of South Tamil Nadu. The city is house to various automobile, rubber, chemical and granite manufacturing industries.{{sfn|''The Hindu''|25 October 2007}} It has developed as a second-tier city for [[Information Technology]] and some software companies have opened their [[Software companies in Madurai|centres]] in Madurai. Madurai has important government educational institutes like the [[Madurai Medical College]], Homoeopathic Medical College,{{sfn|List of Colleges in Madurai}}, [[Government Law College, Madurai|Madurai Law College]], Agricultural College and Research Institute that provides education to aspirants in southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Madurai is administered by a [[Madurai Municipal Corporation|municipal corporation]] established in 1971 as per the Municipal Corporation Act. The city covers an area of 51.96&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 928,869 in 2001.{{sfn|Primary Census Abstract <U+2013> Census 2001}}{{sfn|City Development Plan of Madurai|2004|p=42}} The provisional population totals of 2011 census indicate the population of the city as 1,016,885.{{sfn|Madurai 2011 census data}} The city is also the seat of a bench of the [[Madras High Court]], being one of only a few courts that exist outside the state capitals of India. Madurai is well-connected by road, rail and air.

==Etymology==
The city is referred by various names like "Madurai", "Koodal", "Naanmadakoodal" and "Thirualavai". The word ''Madurai'' is derived from Madhura (sweetness) arising out of the divine nectar showered on the city by the Hindu god Shiva from his matted locks.{{sfn|Various|2007|pp=103<U+2013>106}}{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30<U+2013>36}}  Another popular theory is that ''Madurai'' is the derivative of the word ''Marutham'', which refers to the type of landscape of the [[Sangam landscape|Sangam age]]. According to legend, the original city of Madurai, called ''Then Madurai'' (''Madurai of South''), was destroyed by a [[tsunami]] in ancient [[Kumari Kandam]], after which the city moved inland to its present location. According to Hindu scriptures, the birthplace of the Hindu god [[Krishna]], [[Mathura]], was referred as Vadamadura and the city of Madurai was referred as Thenmadura (southern Madura).{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30<U+2013>36}} There is a town in the neighbouring Dindigul district called Vada Madurai (''North Madurai'') and another in Sivagangai district called [[Manamadurai]]. The different names by which the city has been referred to historically are listed in the 7th century poem ''Thiruvilayaadal puraanam'' written by Paranjothi Munivar.{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30<U+2013>36}}{{sfn|Reynolds| 1987| pp= 12<U+2013>25}}  Koodal means an assembly or congregration of scholarly people referring to the three [[Tamil Sangams]] held in Madurai. Naanmadakoodal, meaning the junction of four towers, refers to the four major temples for which Madurai was known for.{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30<U+2013>36}} ''[[Thevaram|Tevaram]]'', the 7th<U+2013>8th century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent [[Nayanars]] (''[[Saivites]]'') namely Appar,{{sfn|Thirunavukkarasar|2004| pp= 44<U+2013>47}} Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar{{sfn|Campantar Tirumurai 1|2004| p= 61}}{{sfn|Campantar Tirumurai 3|2004| pp= 56<U+2013>58}} address the city as Thirualavai.{{sfn|Harman| 1992| pp= 30<U+2013>36}}{{sfn|Prentiss| 1999| p= 43}}

Madurai is built around the Meenakshi Amman Temple, which acted as the geographic and ritual center of the ancient city of Madurai.{{sfn|King| 2005| p= 72}} The city is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular streets around the temple.{{sfn|King| 2005| p= 72}} [[Vishwanatha Nayak]] (1159<U+2013>64 CE), the first Madurai Nayak king, redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid down by ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]''(Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|<U+015B>ilpa <U+015B><U+0101>stra}}'', also anglicized as ''silpa sastra'' meaning rules of architecture) relevant to urban planning. These squares continue to retain their traditional names, Aadi, Chittirai, Avani-moola and Masi streets, corresponding to the Tamil month names and also to the festivals associated.{{sfn|King| 2005| p= 72}} The temple ''[[prakaram]]s'' (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elobrate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumabulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre.
