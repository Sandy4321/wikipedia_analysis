The '''classification of [[wine]]''' can be done according to various methods including, but not limited to, [[Protected designation of origin|place of origin]] or [[appellation]],<ref name="wine intro">{{cite web|url=http://www.wineintro.com/regions/classification.html|title=Wine Classification}}</ref> vinification methods and style,<ref> M.

Practices vary in different countries and regions of origin, and many practices have varied over time. Some classifications enjoy official protection by being part of the [[wine law]] in their country of origin, while other have been created by, for example, grower's organizations without such protection.

==By appellation==
{{See also|Regional wine classification}}
Historically, wines have been known by names reflecting their origin, and sometimes style: [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]], [[Mosel wine|Mosel]] and [[Chianti]] are all legally defined names reflecting the traditional wines produced in the named region. These naming conventions or "[[appellations#wine|appellations]]" (as they are known in France) dictate not only where the grapes in a wine were grown but also which grapes went into the wine and how they were vinified. The appellation system is strongest in the European Union, but a related system, the [[American Viticultural Area]], restricts the use of certain regional labels in America, such as [[Napa Valley]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[Willamette Valley]]. The AVA designations do not restrict the type of grape used.<ref> Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=33fc0c0194b58b6fe95208945b5c637a&rgn=div5&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.2&idno=27#27:1.0.1.1.2.3.25.6 <U+00A7>4.25]</ref>

In most of the world, wine labeled Champagne must be made from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France and fermented using a certain method, based on the international trademark agreements included in the [[Treaty of Versailles|1919 Treaty of Versailles]]. However, in the United States, a legal definition called [[semi-generic]] has enabled U.S. winemakers to use certain generic terms (Champagne, [[Hock (wine)|Hock]], [[Sherry]], etc.) if there appears next to the term the actual appellation of origin.<ref> Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=33fc0c0194b58b6fe95208945b5c637a&rgn=div5&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.2&idno=27#27:1.0.1.1.2.3.25.5 <U+00A7>4.24] </ref>

More recently, wine regions in countries with less stringent location protection laws such as the United States and Australia have joined with well-known European wine producing regions to sign the Napa Declaration to Protect Wine Place and Origin, commonly known as the Napa Declaration on Place. This is a "declaration of joint principles stating the importance of location to wine and the need to protect place names".<ref>http://www.wineorigins.com/page.cfm?pageID=28 Napa Declaration to Protect Wine Place and Origin (press release, Napa Valley Vintners)</ref> The Declaration was signed in July 2005 by four [[United States]] winegrowing regions and three [[European Union]] winegrowing regions.

The signatory regions from the US were [[Napa Valley]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[Walla Walla]], while the signatory regions from the EU were: [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Cognac]] (the commune where [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac wine]] is produced), [[Douro]] (the region where [[Port wine]] is produced) and [[Jerez]] (the region where [[Sherry]] is produced).

The list of signatories to the agreement expanded in March 2007 when [[Sonoma County]], [[Paso Robles]], [[Chianti Classico]], [[Tokay]], [[Victoria, Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] signed the Declaration at a ceremony in Washington, DC.

==By vinification methods and style==
[[Image:Dark wine grapes.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Dark purple wine grapes on the vine]]
{{seealso|Winemaking}}
Wines may be classified by vinification methods. These include classifications such as red or white wine, sparkling, semi-sparkling or still, fortified and dessert wines. The color of wine is not determined by the juice of the grape, which is almost always clear, but rather by the presence or absence of the grape skin during fermentation. Grapes with colored juice, for example alicante bouchet, are known as [[teinturier]]. Red wine is made from red (or black) grapes, but its red color is bestowed by a process called [[Maceration (wine)|maceration]], whereby the skin is left in contact with the juice during fermentation. White wine can be made from any colour of grape as the skin is separated from the juice during fermentation. A white wine made from a very dark grape may appear pink or '[[Blush wine|blush']]. A form of [[Ros<U+00E9>]] is called ''[[Blanc de Noirs]]'' where the juice of red grapes are allowed contact with the skins for a very short time (usually only a couple of hours).

===Sparkling and still wines===
{{main|Sparkling wine}}
'''[[Sparkling wines]]''' such as [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], contain [[carbon dioxide]] which is produced naturally from fermentation or force-injected later. To have this effect, the wine is fermented twice, once in an open container to allow the carbon dioxide to escape into the air, and a second time in a sealed container, where the gas is caught and remains in the wine.<ref name="MacNeil pg 170"> K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 170 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1563054345 </ref> Sparkling wines that gain their [[carbonation]] from the traditional method of bottle fermentation are labelled "Bottle Fermented", ''"M<U+00E9>thode Traditionelle"'', or ''"[[M<U+00E9>thode Champenoise]]"''. The latter designation was outlawed for all wines other than Champagne (which for obvious reasons does not bother to utilize it) in Europe in 1994.<ref name=OCW>winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''The Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= champagne method|url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=644 }}</ref>

Other international denominations of sparkling wine include [[Sekt]] or Schaumwein (Germany), [[Cava]] (Spain), and [[Spumante]] (Italy). Semi-sparkling wines are sparkling wines that contain less than 2.5 atmospheres of carbon dioxide at sea level and 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. Some countries such as the UK impose a higher tax on fully sparkling wines. Examples of semi-sparkling synonym terms are ''[[Frizzante]]'' in Italy, ''[[Vino de Aguja]]'' in Spain and ''[[Petillant]]'' in France. In most countries except the United States, champagne is legally defined as sparkling wine originating from a region (Champagne, Towns "Reims, <U+00C9>pernay") in France. Still wines are wines that have not gone through the sparkling wine methods and have no effervescence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Still+wine|title=Freedictionary.com}}</ref>

===Dessert and fortified wine===
'''[[Dessert wines]]''' range from slightly sweet (with less than 50 g/L of sugar) to incredibly sweet wines (with over 400 g/L of sugar). [[Late harvest wine]]s such as [[Sp<U+00E4>tlese]] are made from grapes harvested well after they have reached maximum ripeness. Dried grape wines, such as [[Recioto]] and [[Vin Santo]] from [[Italy]] as well as [[Vinsanto]] from Santorini [[Greece]], are made from grapes that have been partially raisined after harvesting. Botrytized wines are made from grapes infected by the mold [[Botrytis cinerea]] or [[noble rot]]. These include [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] from [[Bordeaux]], numerous wines from [[Loire]] such as [[Bonnezeaux]] and [[Quarts de Chaume]], [[Tokaji|Tokaji Asz<U+00FA>]] from [[Hungary]] and Tokaj from [[Slovakia]], and [[Beerenauslese]] from [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. [[Ice Wine|Eiswein]] is made from grapes that are harvested while they are frozen, and are commonly from the Niagara and Okanagan regions in Canada, Germany, and Austria. '''[[Fortified wines]]''' are often sweeter, and generally more alcoholic wines that have had their fermentation process stopped by the addition of a spirit, such as [[brandy]], or have had additional spirit added after fermentation.<ref name="MacNeil pg 488"> K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 488 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1563054345 </ref> Examples include [[port wine|Port]], [[Madeira wine|Madeira]] and [[Banyuls]].

===Other styles===
{{seealso|Category:Wine styles}}
'''[[Table wines]]''' may have an alcohol content that is no higher than 14% in the U.S.. In Europe, light wine must be within 8.5% and 14% alcohol by volume. Thus, unless a wine has more than 14% alcohol, or it has bubbles, it is a table wine or a light wine. Table wines are usually classified as "white," "red," or "ros<U+00E9>," depending on their colour. In Europe 'vins de table' (in French), 'vino da tavola' (in Italian), 'Tafelwein' (in German) or 'vino de mesa' (in Spanish), which translate to 'table wine' in English, are cheaper wines that often on the label do not include the information on the grape variety used or the region of origin.

'''Cooking wine''' or '''Cooking sherry''' refers to inexpensive [[wine|grape wine]] or [[rice wine]] (in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n cuisine). It is intended for use as an ingredient in food rather than as a beverage. Cooking wine typically available in North America is treated with [[salt]] as a [[preservative]] and [[food colouring]].<ref name="MacNeil pg 87"> K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 87 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1563054345 </ref> When a wine bottle is opened and the wine is exposed to [[oxygen]], a [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentative]] process will transform the [[alcohol]] into [[acetic acid]] resulting in wine [[vinegar]]. The salt in cooking wine inhibits the growth of the acetic acid producing microorganisms. This preservation is important because a bottle of cooking wine may be opened and used occasionally over a long period of time.

Cooking wines are convenient for cooks who use wine as an ingredient for cooking only rarely. However, they are not widely used by professional chefs, as they believe the added preservative significantly lowers the quality of the wine and subsequently the food made with that wine. Most professional chefs prefer to use inexpensive but drinkable wine for cooking, and this recommendation is given in many professional cooking textbooks as well as general cookbooks. Many chefs believe there is no excuse for using a low quality cooking wine for cooking when there are quality drinkable wines available at very low prices.

Cooking wine is considered a wine of such poor quality, that it is unpalatable by itself and intended for use only in cooking. There is a school of thought that advises against cooking with any wine one would find unacceptable to drink.<ref name="MacNeil pg 86-87"> K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 86-87 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1563054345</ref>

==By vintage or varietal==
A [[vintage]] wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown in a single specified year, and are accordingly dated as such. Consequently, it is not uncommon for wine enthusiasts and traders to save bottles of an especially good vintage wine for future consumption. However, there is some disagreement and research about the significance of [[vintage]] year to wine quality.<ref>Roman L. Weil, [http://www.liquidasset.com/WEILVDQS.PDF Parker v. Prial: The Death of the Vintage Chart]</ref> Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the labeled vintage.

A [[varietal]] wine is wine made from a dominant grape such as a [[Chardonnay]] or a [[Cabernet Sauvignon]]. The wine may not be entirely of that one grape and varietal labeling laws differ. In the [[United States]] a wine needs to be composed of at least 75% of a particular grape to be labeled as a varietal wine.<ref name="Oxford pg 727"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 727 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref> In the European Union, a minimum of 85% is required if the name of a single varietal is diplayed, and if two or more varietals are mentioned, these varietals combined must make up 100% and they must be listed in descending order. E.g., a mixture of 70% Chardonnay and 30% [[Viognier]] must be called Chardonnay-Viognier rather than Viognier-Chardonnay.
