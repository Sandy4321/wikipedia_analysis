'''Junius Daniel''' (June 27, 1828 &ndash; May 13, 1864) was a planter and career military officer, serving in the [[United States Army]], then in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], as a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]]. His troops were instrumental in the Confederates' success at the [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|first day of the Battle of Gettysburg]]. He was killed in action at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]].

==Early life==
Daniel was born in [[Halifax, North Carolina]], to a wealthy political family. His father [[John Reeves Jones Daniel]] served as an [[attorney general]] of [[North Carolina]] and member of the [[United States Congress]]. His mother Martha Stith came from an important family. Daniel was educated at an elementary school in Halifax and at the J. M. Lovejoy Academy in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. [[President of the United States|President]] [[James K. Polk]] appointed him to the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1846. He graduated 33rd out of 42 in the Class of 1851. Appointed a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the 3rd U.S. Infantry, Daniel was sent to [[Newport, Kentucky]] as assistant [[quartermaster]]. In 1852, he was assigned to [[Fort Albuquerque]] in the [[New Mexico Territory]], remaining stationed at the [[frontier]] outpost for five years. Temporarily under the command of [[Richard S. Ewell]] of the 3rd Dragoons, Lieutenant Daniel saw action in a series of skirmishes with the [[Apache]] Indians in 1855. In 1857, Daniel resigned his commission to begin a career as a planter in [[Louisiana]], joining his father who had moved there following his last term in Congress in 1851. In October 1860, Daniel married Ellen Long, daughter of Col. John J. Long of Northampton County, North Carolina. They had no children.

==Civil War==
Though offered a commission by Louisiana after President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call for volunteer troops in April 1861, Daniel returned to Halifax and instead offered his services to his native state. He was chosen [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] of the 4th (later 14th) [[Regiment]] of [[infantry]]. When the period of enlistment expired, he was offered several positions, commanding the 43rd or 45th North Carolina as well as the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry. He accepted the command of the 45th Regiment as its colonel. 

Daniel led four regiments from Raleigh to [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] and organized them into a [[brigade]]; afterward, he organized two other brigades. In June 1862, he was ordered to [[Petersburg, Virginia]], where his brigade joined General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]] just before the [[Seven Days Battles]], though it took no active part in the combat. Daniel was commissioned [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] on September 1, 1862, making him one of five men from [[Halifax County, North Carolina|Halifax County]] to attain that rank in the Confederate Army. He spent the fall of 1862 with his brigade at Drury's Bluff in [[Virginia]] and subsequently served in North Carolina, although it saw limited combat action.

Shortly after the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], he was transferred to [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Robert E. Rodes]]'s [[division (military)|division]] of Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps, where he served with distinction in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]]. Daniel's large brigade, entrusted to bear the Corps Flag, consisted of the 32nd, 43rd, 45th and 53rd North Carolina, as well as the 2nd North Carolina Battalion. On July 1, 1863, Daniel's Brigade repeatedly attacked the Union positions on [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|McPherson's Ridge]], eventually driving off the [[Union Army|Union]] brigade of [[Roy Stone]]. Daniel's men suffered the greatest losses of any brigade in the corps on the first day of the battle. 

During the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] on May 12, 1864, Daniel led his brigade in a fierce [[counterattack]] on the "Muleshoe" (also known as the "Bloody Angle"), trying to recapture the important position from elements of the [[Army of the Potomac]], which had captured it at dawn. He was struck in the abdomen by a [[Mini<U+00E9> ball]], inflicting a mortal wound. He died the next day in a [[field hospital]]. His body was taken to Halifax and buried in the old colonial cemetery. Unknown to Daniel, Robert E. Lee had recommended his promotion to major general just prior to his death.

Fellow North Carolina general and close personal friend [[Bryan Grimes]] later wrote, "He was decidedly the best general officer from our state.  Though in all probability I gained a brigadier at his death, I would for the sake of the country always remained in the status quo than the country should have lost his services."  General Grimes named one of his sons Junius Daniel Grimes (who would become a well-known [[Washington, D.C.]] attorney in the late 19th century). 

The Junius Daniel Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] of [[Weldon, North Carolina]], was named in the general's memory and honor.
