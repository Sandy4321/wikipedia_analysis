The '''Battle of Nitzanim''' was a battle fought between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and the [[Egyptian Army]] in the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War]], on June 7, 1948 (29 [[Iyar]], [[5708 (Hebrew year)|5708]] in the Hebrew calendar). It was the first major Egyptian victory of the war, and one of the few cases of Israeli surrender.

The battle began on the night of June 6<U+2013>7 with an artillery bombardment of [[Nitzanim]], followed by an aerial bombardment and armored and infantry attacks. The main attack broke through the Israeli defenses at around 11:00; the Israelis retreated to a second position, and finally to a third position at 14:00. At 16:00, 105 Israelis surrendered to the Egyptian Army. Between June 7 and 10, the '''Battle of Hill 69''' was fought nearby. The hill was captured by the Egyptians after a disorganized Israeli retreat.

Israelis viewed the surrender of Nitzanim as a humiliation, especially after the [[Givati Brigade]] published a leaflet denouncing the defenders. The residents of Nitzanim demanded a probe into the battle, and one was conducted by the [[General Staff (Israel)|General Staff]], siding with the residents and coming to the conclusion that surrender was justified.

==Background==
[[Image:Troops in Nitzanim.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Givati troops in Nitzanim]]
[[Kibbutz]] [[Nitzanim]], founded in 1943, was an isolated Israeli village on the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]], enclosed by the Arab localities of [[Ashdod|Isdud]] in the north, [[Ashkelon|Majdal]] in the south, and [[Julis, District of Gaza|Julis]] and [[Beit Daras]] in the east. It was meant to be part of the Arab state in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]].<ref name="carta-33" /> As such, Nitzanim was isolated after December 31, 1947.<ref name="givati-pleshet">Ayalon (1963), pp. 99<U+2013>105</ref> It was attacked many times in the first six months of the [[1947<U+2013>1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] by local irregulars. The Jewish defenders used old Italian [[World War I]] rifles and managed to repel the attacks. In March 1948, [[Haganah]] forces from the headquarters in [[Be'er Tuvia]] broke through to the village, but on the way back were ambushed and the Haganah commander of Nitzanim, Shlomo Rubinstein, was killed in action. On March 26 and April 20, organized Arab attacks took place, and were repelled by the villagers.<ref name="carta battles">Wallach (2003), pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref>

At noon on May 29, an observation post near Nitzanim reported that an Egyptian column of about 150 vehicles had passed along the coastal road to the north. The post later reported that 500 vehicles, an entire brigade, had been counted.<ref name="lorch247">Lorch (1968) p. 247</ref> The Egyptian Army set up a position in Isdud between May 29 and June 1, for what Israelis presumed at the time to be thrust to capture [[Tel Aviv]].<ref name="carta-33" /> However, the Egyptian advance stopped at the [[Ad Halom]] Bridge (over the [[Lakhish River]] to the north of Isdud), which had been destroyed by the [[Givati Brigade]] on May 12. As they made logistical preparations to cross the river, the column was bombed and engaged in [[Operation Pleshet]] (June 2<U+2013>3).<ref name="carta battles-ashdod">Wallach (2003), p. 24</ref> The Egyptians therefore shifted their focus to clearing their flanks, focusing on Nitzanim as some of the injured Israelis who participated in Pleshet were evacuated there.<ref name="carta battles" /> While the nearby village of Beit Daras had been under Israeli control since May 11,<ref name="givati-pleshet" /> there was no continuity with Nitzanim, as Hill 69, which separated the two villages, was not occupied.<ref name="carta-33">Wallach et al. (1978), "Battle of Nitzanim", p. 33</ref> The [[Givati Brigade]] planned to capture the hill on the night of June 7<U+2013>8, but did not anticipate the Egyptian attack on Nitzanim. The plan to capture the hill, however, [[#Hill 69|was carried out on time]].<ref name="idfhistory">IDF History (1978), pp. 227<U+2013>228</ref>

==Prelude==

===Israel===
Until May 15, evacuation of noncombatants, including children, was generally opposed by the [[Yishuv]] leadership. It was argued that Israel's aim in the war was the continuation of normal life and that under the circumstances, it was impossible to draw a line between front and rear. It was also feared that combatants would follow the noncombatants and abandon the settlements. This position changed on May 15. [[Operation Tinok]] ("Baby") saw the evacuation of children from Nitzanim, [[Negba]], [[Gat]], [[Gal-On]] and [[Kfar Menahem]] by armored cars or by foot to places further north, where they were considered to be relatively safer.<ref name=lorch245-246>Lorch (1968) pp. 245<U+2013>246</ref> On the night of May 16<U+2013>17, 35 children from Nitzanim were evacuated on foot to [[Be'er Tuvia]].<ref name="carta-31">Wallach et al. (1978), "Operation Tinok", p. 31</ref><ref name="beikvot" /> 

[[File:Nitzanim orientation.png|thumb|right|Orientation map]]
The Israeli defenders of Nitzanim consisted of two platoons from the [[Givati Brigade]]'s 53rd Battalion, one of which was made up of new recruits, for a total of 74 soldiers. There were also 67 local paramilitaries, ten of them women, for a total of 141 combatants. The force had 70 rifles, 30 submachine guns, 4 [[Bren light machine gun]]s, a 4-inch mortar, one [[PIAT]] and a few grenades.<ref name="beikvot">Yitzhaki (1988), pp. 95<U+2013>97</ref> Nitzanim had three elevations: the highest was in the northeast, where water towers were built; in the center was the dining hall; and to the south was the "Palace"/"Mansion", an abandoned Arab house which was higher than its surroundings. The three elevations were surrounded by a ring of positions connected by a series of communication ditches.<ref name="lorch252">Lorch (1968) p. 252</ref>

===Egypt===
Having taken [[Yad Mordechai]] on May 23, the Egyptian force, under the command of [[Major General]] Ahmad Ali al-Mwawi went up along the coast and bypassed Nitzanim. After meeting with Israeli opposition near [[Ashdod]], he decided to stop and consolidated his positions. Naguib was to dig in in Ashdod, another force was to attack Negba, while Mwawi himself would attack Nitzanim to eliminate its threat to his rear.<ref name=pollack18-19>Pollack (2002), pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> The Egyptian Army set up its main position in the abandoned [[British Empire|British]] military base just east of Nitzanim, with smaller positions in the Cemetery Hill to the northeast and the citrus grove in the south, thus surrounding the village.<ref name="carta-33" /> Mwawi took several days to carefully work out the attack.<ref name=pollack19>Pollack (2002), p. 19</ref> It was to be carried out in three phases: breakthrough and capture of the water tank hill, capture of the dining hall hill and capture of the "Palace".<ref name="lorch253">Lorch (1968) p. 253</ref> The Egyptian force consisted of the 9th Battalion, the 3rd Company of the 7th Battalion and a medium machine gun platoon. They were also joined by a tank platoon, an [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] company, 18 pieces of [[field artillery]], 12 anti-tank guns, an anti-aircraft battery, and supported by combat aircraft.<ref name="beikvot"/>

==Battle==
===Nitzanim===
[[File:Nitzanim Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The "Palace" preserved in Old Nitzanim]]
At midnight on July 6<U+2013>7, Egyptian forces began a bombardment of [[Nitzanim]] from the Cemetery Hill using [[Bofors]] cannons and [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder]]s, and at 06:00, a close-range bombardment using anti-tank guns. All of the prominent features in the village were destroyed. An additional mortar bombardment took place from a southeastern position, and a [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6-pounder]] shelling from the water tank hill in the south. Shortly after, an attack was attempted from the east, but it was repelled and the water tank hill remained under Israeli control.<ref name="carta-33" />

At 08:00, the Egyptians began an aerial bombardment of the [[kibbutz]], which came in three waves and continued until 10:15, at which time shelling continued in the form of 25-pounder fire from [[Ashkelon|Majdal]] about 7 km away. At 11:00, the main thrust of infantry and four tanks commenced. The rest of the armored vehicles provided cover from the adjacent abandoned British base. The Israelis used the lone [[PIAT]] in their possession against the tanks and forced them to retreat, although the PIAT broke down and the Egyptian 1st Company (9th Battalion) managed to infiltrate the water tank hill. The retreating tanks continued to shell the Israeli position and by noon, the hill and the headquarters were captured. Twelve Israelis were killed by the tank shells<ref name="carta battles" /> and the Israeli forces retreated to the dining hall.<ref name="carta-33" />

[[File:Nitzanim-captives.jpg|thumb|right|Many of the male prisoners of war in Egypt]]
A [[counterattack]] at noon by an Israeli patrol unit failed, and at 12:30, the 4th Company of the 9th Battalion, aided by one tank, broke through the northwestern defenses, and also forced them to retreat to the dining hall. The Egyptians commenced heavy shelling of the dining hall, and by 14:00, the defenders decided to retreat to the "Palace" in the south for a last stand. At 15:00, a retreat of all forces southwards from the village was attempted, but was stalled by the 2nd Company of the 9th Battalion situated in the citrus groves, that forced the Israelis back to the "Palace".<ref name="carta-33" /> 2<U+2013>4 Israelis managed to hide in the groves and escape to [[Be'er Tuvia]] at night.<ref name="beikvot" /><ref name="carta battles" /><ref name="haaretz1" />

Throughout the battle, the Israeli forces tried to communicate with the rest of the army and request reinforcements, including three telegrams near the end of the battle, sent by the [[signaller|signal operator]] Miriam Ben-Ari.<ref name="knitzanim-battle">{{cite web|url=http://www.knitzanim.com/s10.html|title=The Battle of Nitzanim|work=The Story of Nitzanim|publisher=Kibbutz Nitzanim|accessdate=2008-12-16}} {{he icon}}</ref> All attempts failed and reinforcements were not sent.

===Hill 69===
[[Image:Givati troops in Bet Daras.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Givati troops in Bet Daras]]
Several men managed to escape from Nitzanim during the day. They hid until nightfall and then infiltrated through the Egyptian lines until they reached the Givati outposts. They were not aware that Nitzanim had surrendered and the only information about it was received from Egyptian broadcasts, so the Givati commander [[Shimon Avidan]] found that out only that evening. Despite the fall of Nitzanim, he decided to attack on the night of June 7<U+2013>8, as planned. One company took Hill 69 and positions to threaten the Egyptian lines at [[Ashdod|Isdud]] and prepared to recapture Nitzanim. Meanwhile, another, unsuccessful, attack was carried out against Isdud. Hill 69 was considered tactically important as an obstacle on the road to Isdud in face of the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War#First truce (11 June 1948<U+2013>8 July 1948)|imminent truce]].<ref name="lorch254-255" />

[[File:Hill 69 memorial, israel.jpg|thumb|left|Monument to the fallen Israeli soldiers on Hill 69]]
On the night of June 9<U+2013>10, Givati's 52nd Battalion, guided by two of the escapees, attacked Nitzanim. Zero hour was postponed after the attacking force lost its way. The leading platoon managed to break into Nitzanim from the south and capture the "Palace", but did not push further. At dawn, it was ordered to withdraw, after being hit by heavy Egyptian fire. The Egyptian artillery pursued the withdrawing Israeli force until it reached Hill 69. The 52nd Battalion forces were evacuated by armored vehicles, and soon after, the Egyptians attacked the hill, which was held by a company from the 51st Battalion.<ref name="carta-hill69">Wallach et al. (1978), "The Battle on the Hill", p. 33</ref> The ditches collapsed completely and the positions were destroyed. The large force that was concentrated on the hill suffered heavy casualties. The Egyptian infantry attacked from the west, supported from close range by [[Universal Carrier|Bren Carrier]]s and armored cars. The Israeli company broke, and was ordered to retreat, but the withdrawal was disorganized and cost more casualties. The last Israeli to remain on the hill was an artillery observer, who ordered his guns to bring down fire on his own position, before being killed.<ref name="lorch254-255" /> The total Israeli death toll on the hill and the retreat from it was 20.<ref name="carta battles-hill69">Wallach (2003), p. 43</ref> The Egyptians tried to continue towards [[Beit Daras]] and [[Be'er Tuvia]], but met with heavy opposition. At nightfall, they withdrew.<ref name="lorch254-255">Lorch (1968) pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Nitzanim battle monument.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial for the fallen Israeli defenders]]
The Battle of Nitzanim was one of the few Israeli surrenders during the war and was seen by many as humiliating.<ref name="haaretz1" /> The 105 prisoners<ref name="haaretz1" /> captured at Nitzanim constituted the majority of [[prisoner of war|POW]]s captured by Egypt during the entire war.<ref name="gelber">Gelber (2006), p. 149</ref> According to the POWs, the Egyptian media covered the event widely, writing that 300 Jews were killed in Nitzanim, that it was a major [[submarine]] base, and that much booty was captured, including oil and fuel.<ref name="knitzanim-captivity">{{cite web|url=http://www.knitzanim.com/s11.html|title=In Captivity|work=The Story of Nitzanim|publisher=Kibbutz Nitzanim|accessdate=2008-12-16}} {{he icon}}</ref> [[Yitzhak Pundak]], the battalion commander who was directly responsible for the village's defense, claims that actions could have been taken to save it, including transferring ''[[Canon de 65 M(montagne) modele 1906|Napoleonchik]]'' cannons to the site.<ref name="haaretz1">{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=418183|title=The Battle Still Rages <U+2013> Part 1|author=Becker, Avihai|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=2004-04-22|accessdate=2008-10-04}}</ref>

When Givati finally reached Nitzanim during [[Operation Yoav]], they found the village abandoned and largely destroyed, as the Egyptians retreated south to [[Gaza]].<ref name="beikvot" /> The Israelis killed in action were buried in a mass grave in the village.<ref name="haaretz1" /> The villagers who returned from captivity on March 7, 1949,<ref name="carta battles" /> as part of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], rebuilt Nitzanim on a site a few kilometers south of the original.

===Reactions in Israel===
[[Abba Kovner]], then the culture officer of the Givati Brigade, published a scathing leaflet denouncing the defenders. Nisan Reznik, who was one of the fighters in Nitzanim, and knew Kovner from before [[World War II]], claimed that the letter was a result of egoism.<ref name="haaretz3" /> Part of the leaflet read:
<blockquote>... The fighters on the southern front, soldiers of the brigade, defenders of the settlements! The hour of Nitzanim's surrender<U+2014>is the hour of extreme grief and personal reflection<U+2014>and a personal reflection says: One doesn't defend one's home conditionally. Defense means with all the forces at the command of one's body and soul, and if fate should so decree, it is better to fall in the trenches of the home than to surrender ... To surrender as long as the body lives and the last bullet breathes in the clip is a disgrace. To fall into the invader's captivity is shame and death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><U+2014>[[Abba Kovner]], partial text of the Givati leaflet, signed by [[Shimon Avidan]].<ref name="haaretz1" /><ref name="carta battles" /></small></blockquote>

As a result, Nitzanim's members demanded an investigation into the battle immediately after the war ended, claiming that Kovner significantly and unrightfully harmed their reputation. The investigation was headed by the Chief of Staff [[Ya'akov Dori]], who sided with the defenders and wrote:
<blockquote>The difficult circumstances of the battle by the residents of Nitzanim, the bitter isolation of the combatants, the lack of communication with the rear-front, lack of ammunition and food, and due to the high number of casualties in that defense, brings honor to all those who fought bitterly there, until the last bullet. What happened in Nitzanim happened also to other places, the defenders of which fought bravely to the last option.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><U+2014>[[Ya'akov Dori]]<ref name="carta battles" /></small></blockquote>
Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] also praised the defenders of Nitzanim.<ref name="carta battles" /> A [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] called ''Target - Tel Aviv'' ({{lang-he|<U+05D4><U+05DE><U+05D8><U+05E8><U+05D4> - <U+05EA><U+05DC> <U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D1>}}) by [[Ram Oren]] was published in 2004, focusing on the battle and its aftermath.<ref name="haaretz1" />
