'''Meredith Hodges''' (born February 5, 1950) is an American [[equine]] trainer, competitor, educator, author and TV personality specializing in [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s, specifically the contemporary saddle mule.

==Early life==
Hodges's mother is Joyce Doty, mule breeder and developer of the first "quality" mules in the United States.<ref>(2003). "Mule It Over", ''Cowboys & Indians''</ref> Her adoptive father was [[cartoonist]] and ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]]. Hodges grew up as one of Schulz's five children, and did not learn until she was an adult that he was not her biological father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Biography Of 'Peanuts' Creator Stirs Family |author=Patricia Cohen|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 October 2007|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0DA163CF93BA35753C1A9619C8B63|accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref> Hodges was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], after which her family moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] where her younger brother was born. The family eventually moved to [[Sebastopol, California]]. After graduating from [[The American School In Switzerland]], Hodges attended [[Sonoma State University]], where she studied [[psychiatric nursing]]. During this time she began work at Sonoma State Hospital with a rotation at [[Napa State Hospital]] as a [[psychiatric technician]]. Her career choice seemed far removed from where life would take her in the future, but, today, Hodges attributes her studies in psychology<U+2014>especially her work in [[behavior modification]] science<U+2014>to be at the core of her understanding of and her ability to communicate with mules and donkeys. In 1973 her mother enlisted her help in tending to the many mules and donkeys on her Windy Valley Mule Ranch in [[Healdsburg, California]]. Hodges became an assistant trainer and worked with her mother, on and off, until 1979, when her mother sold the Windy Valley Ranch.<ref>Noel T.J. with Sladek, R.D. (2002). ''Fort Collins and Larimer County An Illustrated History'', Heritage Media Corp.</ref> Joyce Doty gave Hodges the last mule, Lucky Three Sundowner, and the last jack, Little Jack Horner, that were born at Windy Valley Ranch in 1980.<ref>Hertz, H. (2001). "Meredith Hodges", ''Western Horseman'' 66</ref> Little Jack Horner became the Sire Supreme of the Lucky Three Ranch lineage in Colorado.

==Career==
[[File:MeredithHodges LittleJackHorner Jump.jpg|thumb|Meredith Hodges jumping with champion jack donkey, Little Jack Horner]]
In 1980 Hodges purchased a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} former sheep ranch in Loveland, Colorado and christened it the Lucky Three Ranch. She began breeding and training what would become a top-quality line of mules and donkeys, some of them future champions. Her purpose was to prove that mules could do everything that horses could do in all kinds of recreational equestrian disciplines to further their use in modern America. As she learned more about these equines<U+2019> personalities and abilities, she began to develop her own training program utilizing her own observations and her background in behavior modification. Over the next ten years, guided by the resistance-free training techniques of Richard Shrake and merging the knowledge of many other trainers from multiple equestrian disciplines (such as Major Anders Lindgren in [[dressage]], Rick Noffsinger in driving, Bruce Davidson and Denny Emerson in Combined Training, Al Dunning in [[reining]]), she coalesced her theories and techniques into a comprehensive method called <U+201C>Training Mules and Donkeys: A Logical Approach To Longears.<U+201D> <ref>Peyre-Ferry, M. (1990), "Sport Mules Leaving the Plows Behind", ''HorsePlay''</ref>

Concurrently, Hodges<U+2019> evolving technique proved successful in showing her animals in both horse and mule shows.<ref name=autogenerated1>Voynick, S. (2006). "For the Love of Longears", ''Acres Innovative Country Living'' 14</ref> In 1984 Lucky Three Sundowner became the World Champion Bridle Reined Mule at [[Bishop Mule Days]] in Bishop, California. He then became the World Champion 3rd level Dressage Mule in 1992, and again in 1993, while working at home at 4th Level Dressage.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, most competitive equestrian events were closed to mules and donkeys. In 1986 Hodges lobbied at the United States Dressage Federation (USDF) Convention, wrote letter campaigns, and held forums and discussions with various breed organizations in an effort to change the USDF rules to include mules and donkeys in competition.<ref>(1987). "Mules Make the Grade", ''Equus''</ref> This was done, but the American Horse Show Association (AHSA) still would not accept them. Mules were limited to schooling shows only and not allowed at the upper levels in the USDF shows that were governed by the AHSA. Hodges continued to work with other mule enthusiasts to get mules accepted by the AHSA. On January 18, 2004, mules were finally accepted by the AHSA, now the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The rule was approved with consideration. Mules were now accepted in the Dressage Division of the USEF.

In 1990 her champion jack donkey, Little Jack Horner, jumped four feet in exhibition at [[Bishop Mule Days]], winning a Special Award and making him the only formal jumping donkey in the world.<ref>(2004). "Hodges comes by her love of mules naturally", ''Journal-Advocate, Sterling, Colorado''</ref>

==Animal welfare and advocacy==
Since 1999, Hodges has financially supported Colorado<U+2019>s Hearts & Horses, a NARHA-approved therapeutic riding program, and donated two mules to help develop and expand this program.<ref>(2007). "Hearts & Horses gala a big success", ''Fort Collins Coloradoan''</ref> As an equine rights advocate, Hodges supports and promotes a variety of horse and mule rescue organizations. She is also involved in the efforts to end horse slaughter and the consumption of horsemeat overseas, and the call for ethical and humane treatment and management of the wild horses and burros being overseen by the United States BLM ([[Bureau of Land Management]]).

==Personal life==
She married Gary Fredricksen in 1969.<ref name=autogenerated2>State of California. California Marriage index, 1960-1985. Microfiche. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of HealthServices, Sacramento, California.</ref> Meredith and Gary Fredricksen started managing the Sonoma Craft Magic Leather Shop making unique, original design leather clothes from 1970 up until 1975.  During this time she worked a series of other jobs as a waitress and a skating instructor for the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa.  Her daughter, Dena was born in 1974.<ref>State of California. California Birth index, 1905-1995. Sacramento, CA USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics</ref>  Gary Fredricksen drowned in a swimming accident in [[Bear River (Feather River)|Bear River]] in [[Grass Valley, California]] in 1975<ref>State of California.  California Death Index, 1940-1997.  Sacramento, CA, USA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics</ref> and shortly after Meredith went to the Windy Valley Ranch to work with her mother's equines.  She married Gary Hodges in 1980,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> the same year she purchased the property that would become the Lucky Three Ranch.  Meredith and Gary Hodges divorced in 1992.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
She has two brothers and two sisters.<ref>Patricia Cohen (8 October 2007). "Biography Of 'Peanuts' Creator Stirs Family". The New York Times. Retrieved 11 August 2010.</ref>
