'''Allan Huber "Bud" Selig, Jr.''' (born [[July 30]], [[1934]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]) is the current [[Baseball commissioner|Commissioner of Baseball]], having been formally appointed on [[July 9]], [[1998 in baseball|1998]] after having served as acting commissioner since [[1992 in baseball|1992]]. He was previously the team owner and administrator of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. On [[August 21]], [[2004 in baseball|2004]], Selig's contract was extended by [[Major League Baseball]] through [[2009]], at which point he plans to retire<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2681764M</ref>. Selig is a resident of Milwaukee and owned [[used car]] [[car dealership|dealerships]] before entering baseball.

==Early life== 
As a young man, Selig watched the old [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Milwaukee Brewers minor league team]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]]. Bud soon became a Braves fan when the National League franchise moved to his home town of Milwaukee from Boston in [[1953 in baseball|1953]]. Selig became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was heartbroken and devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of Atlanta. In [[1965 in baseball|1965]], when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team.

==Milwaukee Brewers owner==
{{see also|Milwaukee Brewers#No longer "Home of the Braves"}} 

As a minority owner of the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]], Selig founded the organization '''''Teams, Inc''''', in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, he changed the group's name to '''''Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.''''', after the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league baseball team]] he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at the now-vacant [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The first, a pre-season match between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in [[1968 in baseball|1968]] and eleven in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. Those Milwaukee "home" games were phenominally successful, with the handful of games accouting for about ''one-third'' of total White Sox home attendance. Clearly, Milwaukee was hungry for baseball.

To satisfy that fanbase, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the [[American League]] vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago to compete with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In [[1970 in baseball|1970]], he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the Brewers.

During Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers appeared in the [[1982 World Series]] (under the leadership of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Robin Yount]] and [[Paul Molitor]]) but have failed to make another appearance in the postseason since. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven '''''Organization of the Year''''' awards. Selig was part of owner's [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] in [[1985 in baseball|1985]]-[[1987 in baseball|1987]], resulting in the owners paying [[United States dollar|$]]280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the Commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]] in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] investor [[Mark Attanasio]], questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.

Selig has long been considered a hero by baseball fans in Milwaukee, and while such enthusiasm ebbed somewhat during the failed management term of his daughter, Selig is still recognized for all that he as done for baseball and its presence in Milwaukee. In particular, Selig is famous for his lunches at [[Gilles Frozen Custard]], a well-known hotdog and custard stand not far from [[Miller Park]] in Milwaukee.

==Acting Commissioner==
Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]], and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never admitted that the owners [[Baseball collusion|colluded]], while Vincent did. Said Vincent, {{cquote|The Union basically doesn<U+2019>t trust the Ownership because [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] was a [[United States dollar|$]]280 million theft by Selig and [[Jerry Reinsdorf|Reinsdorf]] of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of free agents. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that<U+2019>s polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it<U+2019>s the reason [[Donald Fehr|Fehr]] has no trust in Selig.}}<ref>http://www.businessofbaseball.com/vincent_interview.htm</ref> Following an 18-9 no-confidence vote, Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the '''Executive Council of Major League Baseball''', and as such became ''de facto'' acting commissioner.

Hailed by some baseball's owners as a visionary who has salvaged the sport, others have vilified Selig.  His first major achievement was to institute the Wild Card and divisional playoff play--a controversial move amongst traditionalists but one that has proven to pass the test of time {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, as fans have enjoyed thrilling playoff series that would not have otherwise been possible, like those between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]].  

As '''Executive Council Chairman''' (Selig's official title while serving as "acting commissioner" from 1992-1998) and Commissioner, new stadiums have opened in [[Chase Field|Arizona]], [[Turner Field|Atlanta]], [[Great American Ballpark|Cincinnati]], [[Jacobs Field|Cleveland]], [[Coors Field|Colorado]], [[Comerica Park|Detroit]], [[Minute Maid Park|Houston]], [[Miller Park|Milwaukee]], [[Citizens Bank Park|Philadelphia]], [[PNC Park|Pittsburgh]], [[Petco Park|San Diego]], [[Pac Bell Park|San Francisco]], [[Safeco Field|Seattle]], [[Ameriquest Field|Arlington]] and [[Busch Stadium III|St. Louis]]. In [[2002 in baseball|2002]]. Selig also began enforcing the 60/40 rule (asset/debt ratio). Whereas in the past, the National and American Leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the [[designated hitter]]), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] into the Commissioner's Office in [[2000 in baseball|2000]]. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were [[Leonard Coleman]] and Dr. [[Gene Budig]] respectively.

Selig suspended [[Marge Schott]] for a year in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] for repeated prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year [[George Steinbrenner]] was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor [[Fay Vincent]]. [[Pete Rose]] has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. It should be noted, that Rose along with his close friend and former teammate [[Mike Schmidt]] (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in 2002, where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]]. Incidentally, Bud Selig was a close friend of the late [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in [[1989 in baseball|1989]].  

As acting commissioner, he presided over the [[1994 in baseball|1994]] players [[1994 baseball strike|strike]] and resulting cancellation of the [[1994 World Series|World Series]] (the first time it had not been staged since [[1904 World Series|1904]]). Since then, some fans have accused Selig of being little more than a puppet for the owners rather than a true leader. Notably, the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]], and [[National Football League|NFL]] commissioners have always been considered primarily as advocates for the league owners who elect them and who they are answerable to. Some have argued that Selig's role as the first clearly pro-owner commissioner has led directly to Major League Baseball's ability to institute changes and bargain strongly with the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Players Association]] in a way that was never possible before.

==Commissioner==
After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the [[1998 in baseball|1998]] season.

During his tenure the game avoided a second work stoppage in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], and has seen the implementation of [[interleague play]], divisional realignment (oddly enough, the subject that resulted in the ouster of Selig's predecessor Fay Vincent), and the addition of a third round of post-season play.

On [[September 11]], [[2001 in baseball|2001]], Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terror attacks on New York and Washington]]. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

Selig was heavily criticized for staging [[contraction]] hearings on the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Montreal Expos|Montr<U+00E9>al Expos]] less than 48 hours after the dramatic conclusion of the [[2001 World Series]]. This action, among others, led to Selig (along with former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]]) being charged with racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners. If found guilty the league could have been liable for [[United States dollar|$]]300 million in punitive damages. Selig was eager to settle the case because the judge had previously ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 

An embarrassing moment for Selig occurred during the [[2002 in baseball|2002]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in Selig's hometown of [[Miller Park|Milwaukee]]. The game was tied 7-7 in the bottom of the 11th inning. Unfortunately, the recent custom of allowing each player appearance time meant that the managers had used their entire rosters. To avoid risking the arms of the pitchers who were currently on the mound, Selig declared the game a tie, to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Since then, Selig has tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game, most notably by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The 2003 All-Star Game had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 [[Nielsen Ratings#Ratings.2FShare and total viewers|rating]]; 17 [[Nielsen Ratings#Ratings.2FShare and total viewers|share]]) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share) <ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/asgtv.shtml</ref>. The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share)<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/specials/all_star/2006/07/12/bc.bbo.all.starratings.ap/index.html</ref>.

In [[2005 in baseball|2005]], he faced [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on the issue of [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]]. Since the Congressional hearings in early 2005, Selig has put forth a much more strict proposal for steroid testing to replace the current system. This proposal also makes Selig the first major sports commissioner to propose the banning of [[amphetamines]], which, some say, are more of a problem in baseball than steroids themselves.

On [[July 1]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Selig suspended [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitcher [[Kenny Rogers (baseball player)|Kenny Rogers]] for 20 games and fined him [[United States dollar|$]]50,000. Rogers got in trouble when on [[June 29]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]], he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers smiled and talked to him.  While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the [[2005 in baseball|2005]] All-Star Game in [[Detroit Michigan|Detroit]], where fans loudly booed him. On [[July 22]], [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension; on [[July 27]], Selig allowed Rogers to return to the game.

On [[December 1]], [[2006 in baseball|2006]], Selig announced that he would be retiring as commissioner of baseball upon the expiration of his contract in 2009.

===The Barry Bonds Issue===
{{mainarticle|2006 Baseball steroids investigation}}
In early [[2006 in baseball|2006]], Selig was forced to deal with the issue of slugger [[Barry Bonds|Barry Bonds's]] steroid use. In ''[[Game of Shadows]]'', co-authors [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]] allege that Bonds has been a steroid-abusing cheat.  Still, Bonds has not admitted steroid use and has never tested positive for banned substances.  

On [[March 30]], [[2006 in baseball|2006]], Selig asked former senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past.

With [[Barry Bonds|Bonds]] passing [[Babe Ruth|Babe Ruth's]] mark of 714 career home runs and closing in on [[Hank Aaron|Hank Aaron's]] all-time record of 755, Selig faces difficult decisions.

===Notable changes to Major League Baseball===
Bud Selig helped introduce the following changes to Major League Baseball:

* [[Interleague play]]
* The [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]
* The new [[Major League Baseball drug policy#Recent changes|steroids]] testing policy
* The [[World Baseball Classic]]
