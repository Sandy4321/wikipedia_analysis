The '''World Schools Debating Championships (WSDC)''' is a high profile annual [[English language|English-language]] [[debate|debating]] [[tournament]] for [[high school]]-level teams representing different countries.  

Six countries participated at the first tournament, organised in [[Australia]] in [[1988]] by Christopher Erskine as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations. Since then, the WSDC has grown to embrace teams from almost 60 countries, with over 30 of them taking part each year.

==Format==
WSDC debates use a special format known as '[[World Schools Style Debating]]'. This is a combination of the [[debate#Parliamentary debate|British Parliamentary]] and Australian formats, designed to meet the needs of the tournament. Each debate comprises eight speeches delivered by two three-member teams (the Proposition and the Opposition). Each speaker delivers an eight-minute speech; then both teams deliver a "reply speech" lasting four minutes, with the last word being reserved for the Proposition. Between the end of the first and the beginning of the last minute of an eight-minute speech, the opposing party may offer "points of information". The speaker may refuse these, but should take at least one or two points during his or her speech.

The style of debate was originally a compromise and not used apart from the championship.  However, the style has since been embraced by many countries for their national competitions, including Australia, Argentina, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Slovenia and Singapore

The WSDC normally takes place over the course of ten days. Each national team competes in eight preliminary debates: four '''prepared debates''' (the [[motion (democracy)|motion]] having been announced a few weeks before the start of the tournament) and four '''impromptu debates''' (for which teams have one hour to prepare). Once the eight preliminary rounds have been completed, the 16 best teams compete in knock-out debates (known as the Octofinals) culminating in a Grand Final. For each debate, three [[judge]]s (or more in later rounds) mark each debater on his or her style, content and strategy.

A notable difference between WSDC and the [[World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships]] <U+2013> the other major international competition of its type <U+2013> is that WSDC's primary focus is on the ranking of each country's team as opposed to each individual participant's ranking.

==Language and participants==
Each country is entitled to enter one team.  As with some other international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup, the nations of the United Kingdom are allowed to take part individually, as are dependent territories (for example, Bermuda) and special regions of some countries (for example, Hong Kong).

All debates in the championship are in English.  This is for practical reasons, but it means that many countries debate in what is for them a foreign language.  This has not stopped a number of these teams being very successful.  Pakistan has been in two grand finals and a number of semifinals, for example; Argentina and Peru both made the semifinals in 1998; Israel has been ranked in the top 16 virtually every year; and Greece only narrowly lost its semifinal in Stuttgart in 2004.  There are special awards for the highest ranked team of English second language speakers, and also of English foreign language speakers.

To show that debate is universal, however, hosts in non-English-speaking nations have often showcased demonstration (non-competition) debates in their own language during the championships.  A notable example was in Lima in 2003, where the teams from Argentina and Peru gave a demonstration debate in Spanish (but in the World Schools style) in the Peruvian Congress chamber.

During the late 1990s a significant number of countries from Central and Eastern Europe joined the championship.  These countries, formerly part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, were introduced to school debate in the early 1990s through the Karl Popper Open Society program.  These teams have been regular competitors and have frequently won the special awards for teams from non-English speaking nations.

Since 2000 the competition has also been joined by a growing number of teams from Asia.  Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong had already been regular competitors, but by 2007 almost the entire sub-continent has joined, as have Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, South Korea, Mongolia and Japan.  Singapore and Pakistan have regularly reached the semifinals and, on several occasions, the Grand Final.

==The World Schools Debating Council==
The WSDC is governed by a '''World Schools Debating Council''', made up of representatives of each of the countries who participate in the championships. Decisions are made by democratic votes of the Council members (though only representatives of countries who have entered teams in at least two of the past three WSDCs may vote on amendments to the championship rules). The Council decides which countries will host the tournament, monitors and revises the WSDC rules, and elects an Executive Committee to handle matters such as adjudication, [[language]] issues, [[education]] and [[finance]]. 

There is a Charter which contains the Aims of the championship and three basic principles.  The principles ensure that there is no censorship of motions for debate, and that all teams take part on an equal basis.   All participants and all hosts must agree to abide by the Charter before taking part.  A consequence is that a country which  will not allow particular teams to enter the country is unable to host.  The team from Israel, for example, is unable to enter several of the countries taking part, and those countries are currently unable to host the championship.  By contrast, Israel itself permits all teams to enter its country, and was therefore able to host the championship in 1998. 

==Charter of the World Schools Debating Championships==
*To achieve excellence in debating
*To encourage debating throughout the world
*To promote international understanding
*To promote [[free speech]]

In order to further these aims, all participating countries agree that: 
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate any issue.
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate against the team of any other participating country.
*The team of any participating country is entitled to take part in the Championships on the same basis as any other participating country's team.

==Best Speakers==

The winner of the Best Individual Speaker award at the World Schools Debating Championships was chosen though a separate public speaking competition up to [[1997]]. From [[1998]] onwards, the best speaker has been determined based on the average scores awarded to each individual debater by judges over the eight preliminary rounds (only debaters who speak in at least four of the eight preliminary rounds are eligible for the award).
