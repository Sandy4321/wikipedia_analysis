The '''MacBook Pro''' is a line of [[Macintosh]] portable [[computer]]s introduced in January 2006 by [[Apple Inc.]] The MacBook Pro replaced the [[PowerBook G4]] and was the second model to be announced in the [[Apple<U+2013>Intel transition]] (after the [[iMac]]). The MacBook Pro is positioned at the high end of the [[MacBook family]].

There have been two designs for the MacBook Pro, both using [[aluminum]]. The first design was largely a carry-over from the PowerBook G4 and utilized the [[Intel Core]] [[central processing unit]]s (CPU)s as opposed to the [[PowerPC G4]] chips used in the model it replaced. It was first released as a 15-inch model in January 2006, followed with a 17-inch model in April of the same year. These original models received several updates, including the implementation of the [[Intel Core 2|Core 2 Duo]] CPUs in late 2006.

The second "unibody" model is a more tapered design with most of the casing made from a single block of aluminum. The unibody design was introduced in the 15-inch MacBook Pro in October 2008, along with the 13-inch [[MacBook#Aluminium unibody model|aluminum unibody MacBook]]. The 17-inch followed in January, also introducing the built-in battery that was later used in the rest of the MacBook Pro line from June and in the regular [[MacBook]] from October 2009. Apple updated the unibody line during April 2010. [[Intel Core i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|Core i7]] CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, with 13-inch models retaining the [[Intel Core 2|Core 2 Duo]] processors. There are currently three MacBook Pro models, the 13-, 15- and 17-inch.

The original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 during [[Steve Jobs]]' keynote at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo#2006|Macworld Expo]].<ref name="mbprelease">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10macbookpro.html | title = Apple Introduces MacBook Pro | date = January 10, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> The 17-inch model was later unveiled on April 24, 2006.<ref name="mbp17release">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/apr/24macbookpro.html | title = Apple Introduces 17-inch MacBook Pro | date = April 24, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> The first design was largely a carry-over from the PowerBook G4 and utilized [[Intel Core]] [[CPU]]s as opposed to the [[PowerPC G4]] chips used in the PowerBooks it replaced,<ref name="early2006macworld">{{cite web | last = Snell | first = Jason | date = February 25, 2006 | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/49555/2006/02/mbpromain.html | title = MacBook Pro/1.83GHZ and 2.0 GHz | work = [[MacWorld]] | publisher = [[Mac Publishing]] | accessdate = April 18, 2010}}</ref> although it was {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} deeper, {{convert|0.4|in|cm}} wider, {{convert|0.1|in|cm}} thinner than the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, while weighing the same.<ref name="ars early 2006">{{cite web | last = Cheng | first = Jacqui | date = March 1, 2006 | url = http://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2006/03/macbookpro.ars | title = MacBook Pro | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = April 22, 2010}}</ref> Other changes from the PowerBook included a built-in [[iSight]] [[webcam]] and the introduction of [[MagSafe]], a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when pulled to prevent the laptop from being pulled off a surface. Both features were later brought over to the [[MacBook]]. The speed of the optical drive as compared to the PowerBook G4 was halved from 8<U+00D7> with [[dual layer DVD]] support to 4<U+00D7> without dual-layer DVD support to accommodate the slimmer form factor of the MacBook Pro, which in turn made the [[SuperDrive]] {{convert|3|mm|in}} thinner.<ref name="early2006macworld"/><ref name="2006notebookreview">{{cite web  | last = Jackman | first = Tom | date = April 17, 2006 | url = http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2890 | title = Apple MacBook Pro Review (pics, specs) | work = NotebookReview | publisher = TechTarget | accessdate = April 19, 2010}}</ref>

Both the original 15- and 17-inch discrete model MacBook Pros came with [[ExpressCard/34]] slots, which replaced the [[PC Card]] slots found in the [[PowerBook G4]]. All discrete 15-inch models have two [[USB 2.0]] ports and one [[FireWire 400]] port,<ref name="Early 2006" /> while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.<ref name="Early 2006 17in" /> When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with [[FireWire 800]] or [[S-Video]] ports,<ref name="Early 2006" /><ref name="ars early 2006" /> although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision<ref name="late 2006 release">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/oct/24macbookpro.html | title = Apple MacBook Pro Notebooks Now with Intel Core 2 Duo Processors | date = October 24, 2006 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 22, 2010}}</ref> and was present in every version of the 17-inch design.<ref name="Early 2006 17in" /> S-Video capability could be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> [[Computer networking|Networking]] is supported with a built-in [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports, while 802.11&nbsp;a/b/g/draft-n<ref name="Early 2006" /><ref name="Early 2006 17in" /> and later 802.11&nbsp;a/b/g/draft-n<ref name="Late 2006" /> [[Wi-Fi]] is supported via an [[AirPort Extreme]] card and [[Bluetooth]] is standard. Connectivity to an external display is achieved in all discrete models by routing the video signal through a [[DVI]] cable.<ref name="Early 2008" />

Apple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006, to include [[Intel Core 2]] Duo processors.<ref name="late 2006 release" /> Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1&nbsp;GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2&nbsp;GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.<ref name="late 2006 release" /> [[FireWire 800]] was added to the 15-inch models.

=== Reception ===
Upon release, reviewers noted the speed increase of the MacBook Pro when compared to the PowerBook G4 as well as the improved [[Wi-Fi|wireless]] performance.<ref name="early2006macworld"/> Reviewers were impressed with the performance increase offered by the 15-inch MacBook Pro over the PowerBook G4. At times, two- or three-fold improvements in performance were seen;<ref name="early2006macworld"/> for example, the [[3D rendering]] program [[Cinema 4D|Cinema 4D XL]] was 3.3&nbsp;times faster<ref name="early2006macworld"/> and the [[booting|boot-up]] time was more than halved.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> The MacBook Pro generally performed better on performance analyzer utility tests, XBench and Cinebench, over the PowerBook G4.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Although a few horizontal pixels were lost (1440&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1440&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;960 in the PowerBook), the screen quality was noted as "nothing less than stellar" by one reviewer, with bright, crisp, and true colors.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> The maximum screen brightness was increased by 67&nbsp;percent over the PowerBook G4, something that reviewers lauded along with the excellent horizontal viewing angles and the matte options.<ref name="2006notebookreview"/> The battery was found to last around 3.5&nbsp;hours per charge, similar to the PowerBook it replaced, and reviewers praised the functionality of the MagSafe power adapter introduced along with the MacBook Pro.<ref name="early2006macworld" /> The backlit keyboard and large [[touchpad|trackpad]] received positive reviews as well, as was the virtually silent operation of the machine.<ref name="early2006macworld" /><ref name="2006notebookreview" />

Reviewers commented on the notebook's overall performance but were critical of the decision to [[underclocking|underclock]] the [[Radeon R520#X1600 series|ATI Mobility Radeon X1600]] graphics card by about 30&nbsp;percent from it original speed.<ref name="2006notebookreview" /> The notebook was also noted for running slightly hot.<ref name="2006notebookreview" /><ref name="early2006macworld" /> Complaints included the increasing difficulty of upgrading [[random-access memory|system memory]] as compared to older generation Apple notebooks.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, accessories such as notebook sleeves were not interchangeable between the two models.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Also, a slight flickering was also mentioned when the screen was on lower brightness settings.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Furthermore, despite the addition of ten [[watt-hour]]s (from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60), the battery life averaged at slightly over three hours, about the same as the PowerBook G4.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> This was attributed to the more powerful Core Duo CPU.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Reviewers were hoping for around an hour more of battery life, but noted that battery life was already about on par or better than competition.<ref name="ars early 2006" /> Although the addition of the MagSafe charging port was praised for saving notebooks from falling to the floor when the [[power cord]] is tripped over, it was found to disconnect too easily in some instances, leading to general irritation for a reviewer.<ref name="ars early 2006" />

[[File:Apple MacBookPros 13-15-17 stacked 08-2009.jpg|thumb|A size comparison of the unibody line of MacBook Pros.]]

On October 14, 2008, at a notebook-oriented event at [[Infinite Loop (street)|Apple's headquarters]], a new 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced featuring an aluminum unibody construction and tapered sides similar to those of the [[MacBook Air]].<ref name="late 2008 update" /><ref name="everymac late 2008">{{cite web | url = http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/stats/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.53-aluminum-15-late-2008-unibody-specs.html | title = Apple MacBook Pro "Core 2 Duo" 2.53 15" (Unibody) Specs | publisher = EveryMac | date = 2008 | accessdate = April 24, 2010}}</ref> This method of constructed has been dubbed "precision aluminum unibody enclosure" by Apple, usually shortened to "unibody".<ref name = "Apple WWDC Keynote Address">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/wwdc09/ | title = Apple WWDC Keynote Address | format = [[QuickTime|QuickTime Movie]] | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = June 10, 2009}}</ref> All of the MacBook Pro's ports were shifted to the left side of the case. The [[optical disc drive]] slot was moved from the left to the right side, similar to the [[MacBook]]. The video cards saw a major update; Apple decided to place two new video cards in the MacBook Pro, the [[nVidia]] [[GeForce]] [[GeForce 9#GeForce 9600M Series|9600M GT]] with 512&nbsp;MB of dedicated [[GDDR3]] [[SDRAM]] and a nVidia GeForce 9400M with 256&nbsp;MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with the main memory.<ref name="everymac late 2008" /> The FireWire 400 port was removed but the FireWire 800 port was retained, and the [[DVI]] port was replaced with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] receptacle.<ref name="15unirelease">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/10/14macbook.html | title = New MacBook Family Redefines Notebook Design | date = October 14, 2008 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name="everymac late 2008" /> The original release unibody MacBook Pro came fitted with a user-removable battery, with a claimed five hours of charge.<ref name="everymac late 2008" /> During normal use, a battery life of just under four hours was reported.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" /> Apple has said that the battery will hold 80&nbsp;percent of its charge after 300 recharges.<ref name="battery life">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html | title = Apple Notebooks | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 21, 2010}}</ref><ref name="macworld battery life">{{cite web | last = Breen | first = Christopher | date = December 10, 2008 | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/137450/2008/12/macbookbatteryanalysis.html | title = Monitoring your MacBook's battery | work = [[MacWorld]] | publisher = [[Mac Publishing]] | accessdate = April 21, 2010}}</ref>

At the [[MacWorld Expo]] keynote on January 6, 2009, [[Phil Schiller]] announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare "matte" screen option and a non user-removable [[lithium polymer]] battery.<ref name="17unirelease">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/01/06mbp.html | title = Apple Introduces 17-inch MacBook Pro With Revolutionary New Built-in Battery That Delivers Eight Hours of Use & 1,000 Recharges | date = January 6, 2009 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> Apple affirmed the battery's design was unlike any existing notebook battery. Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop without wasting space. Adaptive charging extends battery life, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear.<ref name="17unirelease" /> Compared to the previous iteration, battery life for the 17" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80&nbsp;percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charges cycles. This battery is not intended to be user-removable; doing so voids the warranty.<ref name="17unirelease" />

At Apple's [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,<ref name="cnet09 comparison">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | authorlink = Dan Ackerman | date = June 8, 2009 | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10260001-1.html?tag=rb_content;contentMain | title = New Apple MacBooks demystified | publisher = [[CNET Networks|CNET]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.<ref name="Apple Developer Conference - The Guardian">{{cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/08/iphone-wwc-apple-announcements | title = Apple iPhone announcements: from the show floor and all around | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = June 8, 2008 | accessdate = 10 June, 2009}}</ref> It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery inherited from the 17-inch MacBook Pro.<ref name="Mac laptop family album">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | authorlink = Dan Ackerman | date = October 29, 2009 | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-3121_7-6642815.html?tag=mncol;pm | title = Mac laptop family album | publisher = [[CNET Networks|CNET]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.<ref name="Mac laptop family album" /><ref name="cnet09 comparison" /> Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,<ref>{{cite web | last = Shimpi | first = Anand Lal | authorlink = Anand Lal Shimpi | date = June 6, 2009 | url = http://anandtech.com/show/2783/4 | title = AnandTech: Apple's 2009 MacBook Pro: Battery Life to Die For | publisher = [[AnandTech]] | accessdate = June 14, 2009}}</ref> while others reported around six hours.<ref name="CNET June 09 review" /> Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80&nbsp;percent of their capacity.<ref name="mid 2009 release">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/06/08mbp.html | title = Apple Updates MacBook Pro Family with New Models & Innovative Built-in Battery for Up to 40 Percent Longer Battery Life | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | date = June 8, 2009 | accessdate = April 25, 2010}}</ref> Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, with choices of the [[nVidia]] [[GeForce]] [[GeForce 9#GeForce 9600M Series|9600M GT]] with either 256&nbsp;MB 512&nbsp;MB (depending on model) of dedicated [[GDDR3]] [[SDRAM]] and a nVidia GeForce 9400M with 256&nbsp;MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with the main memory.

=== Design ===
The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum [[iMac (Intel-based)|iMac]] and the [[MacBook Air]] and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the [[widescreen]] display.<ref name="everymac late 2008" /> The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed.<ref name="CNET June 09 review">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | authorlink = Dan Ackerman | date = June 10, 2009 | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-summer/4505-3121_7-33676744.html?tag=mncol;lst | title =      Apple MacBook Pro Summer 2009 (Core 2 Duo 2.26GHz, 2GB RAM, 160GB HDD, Nvidia GeForce 9400M, 13-inch) | publisher = [[CNET Networks|CNET]] | accessdate = April 11, 2010}}</ref> The trackpad has also been enlarged, giving more room for scrolling and [[multi-touch]] gestures.<ref name="CNET June 09 review" /> When the line was updated in April 2010, [[inertial scrolling]] was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].<ref name="laptopmag2010"/><ref name="computershopper2010"/><ref name="CNET 2010">{{cite web | last = Ackerman | first = Dan | authorlink = Dan Ackerman | date = April 15, 2010  | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-spring/4505-3121_7-34058852-2.html?tag=txt;page | title = Apple MacBook Pro Spring 2010 (Core i7 2.66GHz, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, 15-inch) | publisher = [[CNET Networks|CNET]] | accessdate = April 17, 2010}}</ref> The entire touchpad is usable, and approximately the bottom two thirds act as a clickable button.<ref name="CNET June 09 review" /> The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.<ref name="computershopper2010"/>

=== Reception ===
When first released, reviewers praised the quality of the screen and sturdy unibody build.<ref name="notebook review late 2008">{{cite web | last = Spitalieri | first = Mike | date = November 4, 2008 | url = http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=4684 | title = Apple MacBook Pro Review (Late 2008 Model) | work = NotebookReview | publisher = TechTarget | accessdate = April 24, 2010}}</ref> With the new unibody design came easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the discrete models.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" /> Reviewers lauded the improved quietness and heat management of the unibody MacBook Pro as compared to the discreet models, which tended to run hotter than its successor.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" /> The MacBook Pro's compact size for its performance range was also complimented.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" />

Reviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" /> Furthermore, the addition of [[Mini DisplayPort]] instead of the more popular [[HDMI]] was criticized.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" /> The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also frowned upon.<ref name="notebook review late 2008" />

Reviewers criticized the reflective finish of the MacBook Pro's screen, asking for matte options across the board. [[CNET Networks|CNET]]'s [[Dan Ackerman]] commented of the mid-2009 models, "According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch  MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions."<ref name="CNET June 09 review" />

''Laptop Magazine''{{'}}s Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it "bright and crisp". He further commented, "While reflections from the glossy display weren<U+2019>t overwhelming, it<U+2019>s also nice to know there<U+2019>s an antiglare option<U+2014>though only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." He also lauded the quality of the [[iSight]] webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of [[USB]] ports, and the lack of [[HDMI]].<ref name="laptopmag2010" />

Of the 2010 models, [[CNET Networks|CNET]] praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the [[Mini DisplayPort]] video output.<ref name="CNET 2010" /> They also called for the addition of HDMI and the [[Blu-ray]] [[optical disc]] format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.<ref name="CNET 2010" /> CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying "the higher-resolution screen should be included by default."<ref name="CNET 2010" />

== Software and operating systems ==
The [[Mac OS X]] operating system has been pre-installed on all MacBooks Pros since release, starting with version [[Mac OS X Tiger|10.4.4 (Tiger)]].<ref name="mbprelease"/> Along with OS X, [[iLife]] has also shipped with all systems, beginning with iLife '06.<ref name="mbprelease"/>

The MacBook Pro comes with the [[BIOS]] successor, [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from conventional BIOS-based computers,<ref name="uefi">{{cite web | url = http://www.uefi.org/about/ | title = Overview | publisher = [[Unified EFI Forum]] | accessdate = February 6, 2010}}</ref> but provides BIOS backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In additon to Mac OS X, the [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], and [[Windows 7|7]], with the necessary hardware drivers included with the [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] software.<ref name="compatability">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/macosx/compatibility/ | title = Built for compatability | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = 21 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="everymac mid 2009" /><ref name="eweek boot camp">{{cite web | last = Morgenstern | first = David | url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/Apples-Boot-Camp-and-the-Myth-of-Mac-Software-Availability/ | title = Apples Boot Camp and the Myth of Mac Software Availability | work = [[eWeek]] | publisher = Ziff Davis Enterprise | accessdate = April 21, 2010}}</ref> Other x86 operating systems such as [[Linux]] are also unofficially supported.<ref name="everymac linux">{{cite web | url = http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/faq/macbook-pro-compatibility-macosx-macos9-windows.html#run_linux | title = Can the MacBook Pro run Linux? | publisher = EveryMac | accessdate = April 25, 2010}}</ref> This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.<ref>[[#Cherif (2007)|Cherif (2007)]], p. 345<U+2013>359.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Nikkel | first = Bruce | date = November 19, 2009 | title = Forensic Analysis of GPT Disks and GUID Partition Tables | journal = The International Journal of Digital Forensics and Incident Response | volume = 6 | issue = 1<U+2013>2 | page = 10 | pages = 18 | publisher = Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/j.diin.2009.07.001 | url = http://www.digitalforensics.ch/nikkel09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = April 26, 2010 | quote = Apple's Boot Camp was developed to allow operating systems (primarily [W]indows) to load on Macintosh hardware. To achieve this, Boot Camp provides a BIOS compatibility module to allow native booting without EFI support. This has also been called "BIOS emulation", "hybrid GPT/MBR", "BIOS-based booting" or "legacy OS booting".}}</ref>

=== Compatibility ===
* '''PowerPC emulation''': As the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform than earlier [[PowerPC]] (PPC)-based Macintoshes, it is incapable of running PPC applications natively. It instead uses the [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] emulator to seamlessly run PPC applications, though at some performance penalty. Due to the manner in which Apple chose to implement it, Rosetta is incapable of emulating some lower level PPC code, and does not support 64-bit ([[PowerPC 970|G5]] specific) PPC features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/universal_binary_intro/universal_binary_intro.html | title = Universal Binary Programming Guidelines, Second Edition | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] | accessdate = July 4, 2007}}</ref>

* '''Classic emulation''':  Intel-based Macs do not support Mac OS X's [[Classic Environment|Classic]] emulation environment ([[Mac OS 9]] and earlier), although third-party emulators such as [[SheepShaver]] may allow these applications to run.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fried | first = Ina | coauthors = Borland, John | date = January 10, 2006 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-7354_3-6025409.html | title = Jobs: New Intel Macs are "screamers" | publisher = [[CNET Networks|CNET]] | accessdate = April 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/06/01/10/apple_unveils_intel_imacs.html | title = Apple unveils Intel iMacs | publisher = [[AppleInsider]] | date = January 10, 2006 | accessdate = December 15, 2008}}</ref>
