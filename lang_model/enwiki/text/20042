'''''Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia''''' (also known as '''''Heroes III''''' or '''''HoMM3''''') is a [[turn-based strategy]] game developed by [[New World Computing]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and released by [[the 3DO Company]] in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]]. An [[Apple Macintosh]] [[Porting|port]] was released by 3DO, and a [[Linux]] port was released by [[Loki Software]], both later that year. It is the third installment of the ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'' series. The game's story is first referenced throughout [[Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven]] and serves as a prequel to [[Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor]]. The player can choose to play through six different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents. 

The [[gameplay]] is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of [[hero]]es that command an army of creatures inspired by [[myth]] and [[legend]]. The gameplay is divided into two parts,  [[tactic (method)|tactical]] overland exploration and a turn based combat system. The player creates an [[army]] by spending [[resource (types and developments)|resources]] at one of the eight town types in the game. The hero will progress in [[experience point|experience]] by engaging in combat with enemy heroes and monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and towns, collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the [[holy grail|grail]] artifact.

''Heroes III'' spawned two expansion packs, ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III: Shadow of Death]]'', as well as ''[[Heroes Chronicles]]'', a series of short introductory games. A special version ''Heroes III Complete'' on 2 CDs that included the original game and both expansion packs was released in 2000.

== Story==
The game's story unfolds primarily through a series of seven playable campaigns, all set upon the continent of [[Antagarich]]. During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as each of the town alignments.

Following her marriage to King Roland Ironfist of Enroth in ''[[Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven]]'', Catherine becomes a Queen. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart, is assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eofol. Queen Catherine returns home seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their nation.

Erathia's capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the demons of Eofol. Catherine's first task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it. In the meantime, the necromancers of Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart's will proves too much for the necromancers even in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful.

There are also two campaigns that do not involve the main storyline. In one, the two neutral town alignments feud with each other over territorial disputes. Another campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living along the border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the border skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to fight for independence from the two large kingdoms.

== Gameplay==
{{main|Heroes of Might and Magic#Gameplay}}
Gameplay consists of strategic exploration on the world map and tactical turn-based combat. As with the series in general, the player controls a number of "heroes" who act as generals and command troops comprising various types of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The player can complete or "win" a map by completing the objectives set out by the creator of the map. Objectives may include conquering all the towns in the map, gathering a set amount of resources, or piecing together a puzzle to find the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] artifact. If a player loses all their heroes and towns, they will lose the game.

There are two "layers" to the world map - the aboveground and the underground. There are typically subterranean gateways that lead to and from the underground.

If a player finds the Grail artifact, they can deliver it to a town to make that town the Grail's permanent home by creating a special structure. The Grail bestows greatly increased creature growth and weekly income, in addition to a bonus unique to the town, such as the Skyship in the Tower town, which reveals the entire world map and gives defending heroes a knowledge statistic bonus in the event of a siege.

=== Town alignments ===
[[Image:CastleTown.jpg|thumb|250px|The Castle town is the home of [[Knight]]s and [[Cleric (character class)|Cleric]]s.]]

There are eight different town alignments available in ''Heroes III'': three "good" towns (Castle, Tower, and Rampart), three "evil" (Inferno, Dungeon, and Necropolis), and two "neutral" (Fortress and Stronghold). Each town has seven basic creatures, each of which can be upgraded to a more powerful variant. Each town also features two associated hero types: one that leans more toward might (combat), and one that leans more toward magic. Some towns have a predisposition toward might or magic, and the leanings of the hero classes may simply be a matter of degrees.

The might hero is the [[Knight]] and the magic hero is the [[Cleric]]. The kingdom of Erathia is of the castle alignment.

* The Stronghold is populated with brutish, tribal creatures associated with barbarism. [[Goblinoid]]s and organic giants make up the bulk of the army. Stronghold units are at home in the deserts and wastes. The might hero is the [[Barbarian]] and the magic hero is the [[Battle Mage]]. The kingdom of Krewlod is of the stronghold alignment.

== Expansion packs ==
{{main|Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade}}
{{main|Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death}}
Two [[expansion pack]]s were released for ''Heroes III''. The first of these expansions, ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade|Armageddon's Blade]]'', introduced a ninth town alignment, the Conflux; a random scenario generator, a variety of new creatures, heroes, and structures; and six new playable campaigns.

The second expansion, ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death|The Shadow of Death]]'', was a standalone expansion that included ''Restoration of Erathia'' and added seven new playable campaigns and a variety of new artifacts, including Combination Artifacts.  Combination Artifacts were extremely powerful items assembled by collecting a specific set of lesser artifacts.

Neither ''Armageddon's Blade'' nor ''The Shadow of Death'' were released individually for Macintosh or Linux. ''Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete'', a [[Compilation (games)|compilation]] of ''The Restoration of Erathia'' and both expansion packs, was released for Windows and Macintosh.

An unofficial [[fangame]] expansion pack ''Heroes of Might and Magic 3<U+00BD>: In the Wake of Gods'' was released on November 20th, 2001. It introduces a brand new [[scripting language]] to the game, enhancing the potential for modding. In addition, the release includes a large variety of new creatures and structures, balance changes, and several new campaigns. ''In the Wake of Gods'' is only available for Windows.
