Most sources mention [[<U+0160>ibenik]] as Nikola's birthplace, but another possible location is Velim near [[Stankovci]]. In 1365, Nikola became a [[friar]] in [[Bribir]], the seat of the [[<U+0160>ubi<U+0107>]], a powerful [[Croatia]]n noble family. 

Nikola was among 60 priests from various Franciscan provinces who were called by the [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]n [[vicar]], motivated by Pope [[Gregory XI]], to work as missionaries in Bosnia. He spread Catholicism around Bosnia for 12 years. In his report to the pope, the Bosnian vicar later said that the missionaries converted around 50,000 [[Bogomils|Bosnian heretics]]. 

In 1384, Nikola went to [[Palestine]] with the Franciscans Deodatus and Peter from [[Narbonne]] and Stephen from [[Cuneo]]. He stayed in the [[Mount Sion Monastery]] in [[Jerusalem]], learning Arabian and visiting holy places. Together with his three friends, he was brought before the [[qadi]] of Jerusalem and sentenced to death. All four missionaries were martyred near the [[Jaffa Gate]] on [[November 14]], [[1391]].

== Canonization ==

The Franciscan Gerard Chalvet headed the monastery of Holy Salvation and saw their execution. Together with the Franciscan Martin from [[<U+0160>ibenik]], he sent a detailed report to Europe: [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Leipzig]], <U+0160>ibenik and elsewhere. Nikola was celebrated as a martyr by Franciscans all over Europe, especially in <U+0160>ibenik.

Five centuries later, in 1880, the bishop Antun Josip Fosco from <U+0160>ibenik started the procedure for the [[Holy See]] to [[beatification|beatify]] Nikola Taveli<U+0107>. It was done by a special decree of the pope [[Leo XIII]] for the <U+0160>ibenik Diocese in 1889 and for the entire Franciscan Order in 1898. Two years later, the same thing was done for the [[Holy Land]].

The cult of Nikola Taveli<U+0107> grew between the world wars. He was [[canonization|canonized]] by the pope [[Paul VI]] in front of 20,000 [[Ustasha|Croats]] in [[Rome]], on [[June 21]], [[1970]].

== Churches ==

The feast day of Saint Nikola Taveli<U+0107> is [[November 14]].

Most churches built in his name are located in Croatia. Some of them are in [[Banjevci]], [[Cerovac]], [[Li<U+0161>ani]], [[Perkovi<U+0107>]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Vinjani]], [[Zagreb]] and [[<U+017D>upanja]].
