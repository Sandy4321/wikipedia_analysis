The '''UH-60 Black Hawk''' is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility [[helicopter]] manufactured by [[Sikorsky Aircraft]]. Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the [[United States Army]]'s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the ''YUH-60A'' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the [[Boeing Vertol YUH-61]]. The UH-60A entered service with the Army in 1979, to replace the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] as the Army's tactical transport helicopter.

==Development==
In the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements in for its Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) helicopter to replace the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] based on experience in Vietnam.  The Army also initiated the development of a new turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the [[General Electric T700]].  The Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS aircraft and powerplant.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 8-10.</ref>  The Army released its UTTAS requests for proposals (RFP) in January 1972.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 11, 39.</ref> 

Four prototypes were constructed, the first (YUH-60A) flying in October 1974, and evaluated against a rival [[Boeing-Vertol]] design, the [[Boeing-Vertol YUH-61|YUH-61A]].  Prior to delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing.<ref>Leoni 2007, p. 165.</ref>  Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research.  The Black Hawk was selected for production  in December 1976.  Deliveries of the UH-60A to the US Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.<ref name="Eden">Eden, Paul. "Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1904687849.</ref>

Since entering service, versions of the helicopter have been modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying, medical evacuation, electronic warfare, and special operations.  The EH-60 variants conduct electronic warfare and the special operations use the MH-60 variants.<ref>Tomajczyk 2003, pp. 15<U+2013>29.</ref>

Due to weight increases from addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987.  The new model incorporated changes made to UH-60A during its production run.  The UH-60L featured more power and lift with the upgraded T700-701C engine and stronger gearbox developed for the [[SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B Seahawk]].<ref name="Leoni p217-8">Leoni 2007, pp. 217-218.</ref>  The automatic flight control system (AFCS) from the SH-60 was also added to better control the more powerful engines.  Its external lift capacity increased by {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name="Bishop_UH-60">Bishop, Chris. ''Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk''. Osprey, 2008. ISBN 978-1-84176852-6.</ref>  Production on the L-model began in 1989.<ref name="Leoni p217-8"/>

In 2001, development of the next improved variant was approved.  The UH-60M uses the more powerful T700-701D engine model and improved rotor blades.  Manufacturing began on the UH-60M in 2006.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 233-236.</ref><ref>[http://www.sikorsky.com/vgn-ext-templating-SIK/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=00de6eb78fa78110VgnVCM1000001382000aRCRD&vgnextchannel=162f45d57ef68110VgnVCM1000001382000aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&pressvcmid=69fea96c2e289110VgnVCM1000001382000aRCRD "Sikorsky Aircraft Delivers First New Production UH-60M BLACK HAWK Helicopter to U.S. Army"].

==Design==
The Black Hawk helicopter series can perform a wide array of missions, including the tactical transport of troops, electronic warfare, and aeromedical evacuation.  A [[Very Important Person|VIP]] version known as the VH-60N is used to transport important government officials (e.g., Congress, Executive departments) with the helicopter's call sign of "[[Marine One]]" when transporting the [[President of the United States]].<ref> [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/vh-60.htm VH-60], Global Security</ref>  In [[air assault]] operations it can move a squad of 11 combat troops with equipment or reposition the 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]] with thirty rounds of 105&nbsp;mm ammunition, and a four-man crew in a single lift. Alternatively, it can carry 2,600 lb (1,170&nbsp;kg) of cargo or sling load 9,000 lb (4,050&nbsp;kg) of cargo (for UH-60L/M).<ref name="UH-60_army-tech">[http://www.army-technology.com/projects/black_hawk/ UH-60 Black Hawk Sikorsky S-70A - Multi-Mission Helicopter], Army-Technology.com.</ref> The Black Hawk is equipped with advanced avionics and electronics for increased survivability and capability, such as the [[Global Positioning System]].

The UH-60 can be equipped with stub wings at top of fuselage to carry fuel tanks or possibly armament.  The initial stub wing system is called external stores support system (ESSS).  It has two pylons on each wing to carry two {{convert|230|USgal|L|abbr=on}} and two {{convert|450|USgal|L|abbr=on}} tanks in total.<ref name="Bishop_UH-60"/>  The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS).<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-04-500/appg.htm TFM 3-04.500 Army Aviation Maintenance, Appendix G]. US Department of the Army, 26 September 2000. Hosted on GlobalSecurity.org. Accessed: 15 April 2009.</ref> The ESSS can also carry {{convert|10000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of armament such as rockets, missile and gun pods.  The ESSS entered service in 1986.  However it was found that with four fuel tanks it would obstruct the firing field of the door guns.  To alleviate the issue, the external tank system (ETS) with unswept stub wings to carry two fuel tanks was developed.<ref name="Bishop_UH-60">Bishop, Chris. ''Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk''. Osprey, 2008. ISBN 978-1-84176852-6.</ref> 

The unit cost varies with the version due to the varying specifications, equipment and quantities. For example, the unit cost of the Army's UH-60L Black Hawk is $5.9 million while the unit cost of the Air Force MH-60G Pave Hawk is $10.2 million.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/h-60.htm H-60], Global Security</ref>

==Operational history==
===US Army===
[[Image:Black Hawk Down Super64 over Mogadishu coast.jpg|thumb|right|US Army UH-60 during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].]]

The UH-60 entered service with the US Army's 101st Airborne Division in June 1979.<ref name="Vector_UH-60">[http://www.vectorsite.net/avs70_1.html Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk], Vectorsite.net, 1 July 2006.</ref>  The UH-60 saw its first combat service in the US [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983. UH-60As also served in the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] in 1989. UH-60A and UH-60L Black Hawks participated in the Gulf War of 1991. In 1993, Black Hawks featured prominently in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|assault on Mogadishu]] in [[Somalia]]. Black Hawks also saw action in the [[Balkans]] and [[Haiti]] in the 1990s. UH-60s continue to serve in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name="Bishop_UH-60"/>

=== Colombia===
Colombia is a large user of the UH-60, many have been received from the US since 1987.  The [[Colombian National Police]], [[Colombian Air Force]], and [[Colombian Army]] use UH-60s against drug and guerrilla organizations. Its main function is to mobilize troops and supplies to places which are difficult to access by ground. The Colombian military also uses Black Hawk for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations, search & rescue and medical evacuation.   It has a gunship version of the UH-60 with stub wings, locally known as "Arpia".<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 270-273.</ref>

===Israel===
The Israeli Air Force received its first Blackhawks in August 1994, 10 US Army surplus UH-60As. The Black Hawk replaced the [[Bell UH-1]] as the main utility helicopter of the Israeli Defense Forces.  The IAF first used the UH-60s in combat in April 1996, during operation "Grapes of Wrath" against the Hizbullah in southern Lebanon.  

In March 2000 three Blackhawks were used to ferry Pope John Paul II on his visit to Israel, with one helicopter carrying the Pope, another his medical team and a third available on constant standby.  It has been used by the IDF in Lebanon along with operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The IAF had 49 UH-60s in operation in late 2008.<ref name="FI_AirForces_2008"/>

===Mexico===
[[File:PF Blackhawk.JPG|thumb|right|Mexican Federal Police UH-60/S-70]]
The Mexican Air Force received its unit of Blackhawks in 1994, its main purpose is to transport special forces units.<ref>http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_529.shtml</ref> In March 2009, the US stated it would provide helicopters and other equipment under the [[M<U+00E9>rida Initiative]], to fight the drug cartels in the [[Mexican drug war]].<ref>[http://www.citizen.co.za/index/article.aspx?pDesc=1,1,22&type=top&File=newsmlmmd.1b5b033a06ea12570736e0c24ba988b0.01.xml Clinton vows US backing in Mexican drug wars]. </ref>  In July and August 2009, the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]] used UH-60s in attacks on drug traffickers.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31940160 "Mexico sends 1,000 more police to drug area"].
