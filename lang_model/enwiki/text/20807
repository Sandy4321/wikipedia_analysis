'''''Escape from Woomera''''' is an unfinished [[Point-and-click_adventure_game#Point-and-click_adventure|point-and-click adventure]] video game, intended to critique the treatment of [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatorily detained asylum seekers in Australia]] as well as the Australian government's attempt to impose a media blackout on the detention centers. In the game, the player assumes the role of Mustafa, an Iranian asylum seeker being held at [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]]. Mustafa's request for asylum has been denied, and fearing that will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation Iran, he decides to attempt to escape Woomera. Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre in order to devise and execute an escape plan.  

The game was developed in 2003 and 2004 by a team of Australian video game industry professionals and an [[investigative journalist]], using ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''{{'}}s [[GoldSrc]] engine. The developers received an AU $25,000 grant from the [[Australia Council for the Arts|Australia Council]] in order to make the game, propelling the project to national attention, where the idea received a predominantly negative reception. The Australia Council's decision to fund the game drew condemnation from both [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (Australia)|Minister for Immigration]] [[Philip Ruddock]] and [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] leader Dr. [[Seweryn Ozdowski|Sev Ozdowski]]. Unable to secure further funding, a full game was never developed, and the playable prototype was made available for free online.

==Plot==

''Escape from Woomera'' opens with three screens of text that explain the game's background. Players assume the roll of Mustafa, who paid smugglers to bring him to Australia after his parents were killed by the Iranian secret police. After the boat transporting him crashed in the [[Ashmore Reef]], Mustafa was brought to the [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre]], where he was given the identification number "RAR-124". After three months, Mustafa was informed that his request for asylum was denied, and that he would be repatriated to Iran. Believing that he would be tortured and killed upon his return, Mustafa decided to escape Woomera.<ref name=CDF_174>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174.</ref>

Because the game was never completed, only a small portion of the intended gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers in order to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the cans are garbage stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers.<ref name=CDF_174-175>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174-175.</ref><ref name=P_2-4>Poremba (2013), 2-4.</ref> Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard [[Quran desecration|threw her copy of the Quran to the ground]], mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from previous escape attempt.<ref name=CDF_174-175 />

==Gameplay==

''Escape from Woomera'' is a [[Point-and-click_adventure_game#Point-and-click_adventure|point-and-click adventure]] game. The player, controlling Mustafa, explores the Woomera center, which is populated with [[non-player character]]s - computer controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him information about the facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.<ref name=CDF_174-175 /><ref name=P_2-3>Poremba (2013), 2-3.</ref>

The game has a meter that tracks Mustafa's hope. As he completes tasks that take him towards the goal of escaping, the meter increases. Listening to the experiences of fellow detainees, which in some cases is required in order to gain access to other information or tasks, drains Mustafa's hope. If he is caught breaking rules by the guards, Mustafa is placed in solitary confinement, which also drains hope. Should the hope meter run out, Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape, and is deported.<ref name=CDF_174-175 /><ref name=P_19-20>Poremba (2013), 19-20.</ref><ref name=Polygon>{{cite web|last=Lien|first=Tracey|title=Escape from Woomera still highlights Australia's shame 11 years on|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/16/5717520/escape-from-woomera-immigration-australia|work=[[Polygon]]|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=16 May 2014}}</ref> 

==Development==

The idea for a video game centered around asylum seekers in Australia came to Katherine Neil, then an developer at [[Atari]]'s Melbourne studio, in the aftermath of the 2001 [[Tampa affair]].<ref name=CDF_175>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175.</ref><ref name=ABC>{{cite web|last=Golding|first=Daniel|title=Videogames and politics: Why was Escape From Woomera so divisive?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/blog/Daniel-Golding/videogames-politics-Escape-From-Woomera-130901/|work=Arts|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=2 September 2013}}</ref> Neil spent a year and a half assembling a team to work on the game and securing initial funding for the project.<ref name=CDF_175 /> Fourteen people contributed to the game, with a core development team of four.<ref name=ABC /> Many of the Australian members of the development team, including Neil, contributed to the project anonymously in order to protect their jobs.<ref name=ABC /><ref name=Polygon />

Neil stated that her motivation for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes.<ref name=ABC /> The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticize the treatment of [[Mandatory detention in Australia|detained asylum seekers in Australia]], and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task.<ref name=Polygon /> At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, and that they were a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly.<ref name=ABC /><ref name=Polygon /><ref name=CDF_178-179>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 178-179.</ref> The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to and coverage of the detention facilities.<ref name=ABC /><ref name=BBC>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Dominic|title=Australia funds asylum game|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2987745.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=[[BBC{{!}}British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=30 April 2003}}</ref>

The original plan for ''Escape from Woomera'' involved several choices in playable detainees, each with a different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia. The game would have players "battle the bureaucracy and try and survive day to day" while working towards any of several escape strategies.<ref name=Scan>{{cite journal|last=Swalwell|first=Melanie|title=A Conversation with the Developers of Escape from Woomera|journal=Scan|date=June 2004|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://scan.net.au/scan/journal/print.php?journal_id=28&j_id=2}}</ref> As originally envisioned, players could attempt to escape through the legal channels, using lawyers and activists, or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels.<ref name=BBC /><ref name=SMH>{{cite web|last=Nicholls|first=Sean|title=Escape game wires the minister|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/29/1051381951157.html|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=30 April 2003}}</ref> The development team attempted to create as realistic of a depiction of the Woomera centre as possible, despite the media not being allowed in the facility.

Initial funding for the development of ''Escape from Woomera'' came from the Australian government's arts funding organization, the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. The Australia Council gave the developers AU $25,000, intending for the money to allow the game to be developed to the point that it could secure additional funding from other sources. While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding.<ref name=CDF_175-176>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175-176.</ref> The playable demo, which was built as a [[mod (video gaming)|modification]] of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', was made available for download on the game's website.<ref name=P_2-4 /><ref name=Polygon /><ref name=CDF_173>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 173.</ref>

==Reception==

The Australia Council's decision to fund ''Escape from Woomera'' was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began.<ref name=Polygon /> Australia's [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (Australia)|Minister for Immigration]], [[Philip Ruddock]], released a statement saying "The decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour".<ref name=SMH /> Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she was surprised at how strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment.<ref name=ABC /> The leader of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], Dr. [[Seweryn Ozdowski|Sev Ozdowski]], released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that "The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick."<ref name=AHRC>{{cite web|title=Escape Game is not a laughing matter|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/media-releases/escape-game-not-laughing-matter|work=[[Australian Human Rights Commission]]|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=1 May 2003}}</ref> The chairman of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the decision to fund the game, stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime, and characterizing the team's application for funding as strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media.<ref name=Age>{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Meaghan|title=Refugee group condemns video game|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/30/1051381998181.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=The Age Company Ltd|accessdate=18 May 2014|date=1 May 2003}}</ref>

A decade after development began, the view of ''Escape from Woomera'' is significantly more positive. In 2013, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] called it "one of the first<U+2014>and still one of the most important<U+2014>politically-focused videogames".<ref name=ABC /> The textbook ''The Alternative Media Handbook'' used the game as a case study in [[culture jamming]], and categorized it as an early example of video games carrying a political message.<ref name=CDF_177-179>Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 177-179.</ref>
