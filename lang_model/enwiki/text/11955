==High school==
McNamara attended Bishop Hannan High School.  In his four seasons at Hannan, the Golden Lancers compiled a record of 109-17.  McNamara was named the Lackawanna League Division II Player of the Year for four years in a row, was a three-time [[Associated Press]] [[Pennsylvania]] Small School All-State First Team selection and was the AP's Pennsylvania State Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002.  McNamara finished as Pennsylvania's seventh all-time leading scorer with 2917 points.<ref name=suathletics>{{cite web |title=Gerry McNamara Profile |url=http://www.suathletics.com/roster.asp?playerid=1085&sport=176&roster=142 |work=SUAthletics.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>   

Bishop Hannan advanced to the Pennsylvania Interscolastic Athletic Association Class AA championship game in his freshman and sophomore seasons and finished the state runner-up in both 1999 and 2000 to Kennedy Christian High School of [[Hermitage, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=gmacwebsite>{{cite web |title=Gerry's Summer of 2000 |url=http://gerrymcnamara.tripod.com/gerry.htm |work=GerryMcNamara.com |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

In 2001 the Golden Lancers were defeated by eventual PIAA Class AA champion [[Trinity High School]] of [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania]], in the Eastern Final.<ref name=trinity>{{cite web |title=PIAA Basketball Championship capsules  |date=[[2006-09-22]]|url=http://www.towsontigers.com/sports/mbball/release.asp?release_id=3103 |work=Towson Tigers |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>   

In 2002 Bishop Hannan and Trinity met once again in the Eastern Final.  McNamara exploded for a career-high 55 points (41 in the first half) as the Golden Lancers advanced to the Class AA championship game, 83-76.<ref name=fishing>{{cite web |title=Gerry McNamara joins SU basketball team next year |first=Wesley |last=Cheng |date=[[2006-03-02]]  |url=http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2006/03/02/GerryMcnamara/Gerry.Mcnamara.Joins.Su.Basketball.Team.Next.Year-1649995.shtml |work=The Daily Orange |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Three days later his 32 points led all scorers as Hannan held off [[Sto-Rox High School]] and won the Class AA state title, 70-68.<ref name=storox>{{cite web |title=PIAA Basketball Championship capsules |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/sports/highschoolcentral/s_124749.html |work=The Tribune-Review |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>   

Following his senior season, McNamara was named the 2002 Pennsylvania [[Gatorade]] Player of the Year and a fourth-team [[Parade Magazine]] All-American.<ref name=suathletics /> For his high school accomplishments, McNamara was also named the 20th greatest athlete in Scranton-area history by the ''[[Scranton Times]]'' in 2004.<ref name=twentyscranton>{{cite web |title=No. 20 Gerry McNamara -- Bishop Hannan basketball |date=[[2004-12-07]]  |url=http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13504766&BRD=2185&PAG=461&dept_id=416049&rfi=6 |work=The Times-Tribune |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

==College==   

McNamara had offers from schools such as [[Duke University|Duke]] and [[Florida Gators|Florida]], but chose Syracuse, instead.<ref name=recruiting>{{cite web |title=McNamara no tank, but he is helping drive Syracuse |first=Jeff |last=Zillgitt |date=[[2003-04-06]]  |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney03/2003-04-06-zillgitt-mcnamara_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> 

=== Freshman ===

McNamara helped capture the school's first ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Championship]] in 2003.  McNamara started every game his freshman year, helping lead the Orange to a 30-5 record, including a perfect 17-0 at home. He averaged 13 points, 4.6 assists and 2.2 steals a game while shooting 35 percent from 3-point range and 91 percent from the foul line.<ref name=recruiting />

McNamara showed early on that he was a clutch performer, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched a 82-80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February.<ref name=notredamewinner>{{cite web |title=McNamara<U+2019>s game-winning 3 lifts SU to win over Notre Dame |first=Darryl |last=Slater |date=[[2003-02-17]]  |url=http://www.dailyorange.com/media/paper522/news/2003/02/17/Sports/Mcnamara8217s.GameWinning.3.Lifts.Su.To.Win.Over.Notre.Dame-371327.shtml |work=The Daily Orange |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force overtime. Until that point, McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara made up for his miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat [[Mike Sweetney]] and the [[Georgetown Hoyas]], 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.<ref name=gtown2003>{{cite web |title=Syracuse rookies dominate in OT win at Georgetown |date=[[2003-03-01]]  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/2003/03/01/georgetown_syracuse_ap/ |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

In the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] second-round game against [[Oklahoma State]], McNamara scored 14 points and added six assists as the Orangemen overcame a 13-point first-half deficit. In the semi-final game against [[TJ Ford]] and the [[University of Texas]], the Orangemen won 95-84 behind a career-high 33 points from Anthony and 19 points and four steals from McNamara.<ref name=texas2003>{{cite web |title=Syracuse trumps Texas to advance to title game |date=[[2003-04-06]]  |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/04/06/final_four1030405.html |work=CBC Sports |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

In the title game versus favored [[University of Kansas]], his six [[three pointer]]s in the first half helped Syracuse open up an 18-point lead over the [[Jayhawks]]. In the second half, Syracuse held off a furious Kansas comeback, eventually winning the game 81-78 behind the stellar play of freshman star [[Carmelo Anthony]] and a game-saving blocked shot by sophomore forward [[Hakim Warrick]].<ref name=2003kansas>{{cite web |title=McNamara carries Syracuse in first half |date=[[2003-04-08]]  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/2003/ncaa_tourney/news/2003/04/07/mcnamara_ap/ |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>  McNamara and Anthony were named to the All-Tournament team.<ref name=gmacalltournament>{{cite web |title=Syracuse<U+2019>s Anthony in rare company |date=[[2003-04-07]]  |url=http://www.rgj.com/news/printstory.php?id=38888 |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

=== Sophomore ===

Anthony rode his heralded postseason play into the [[NBA]], leaving Warrick and McNamara to guide the team in the 2003-2004 season. McNamara would not disappoint, averaging 17.2 points per game. He was also a Wooden and Naismith award candidate and Second Team All-Big East selection. Warrick and McNamara led the Orange to a 23-8 record and a five seed in the NCAA Tournament.  McNamara scored 43 points, including a school-record nine three-point shots, as Syracuse outlasted [[Brigham Young University]] 80-75 in the tournament's first round.<ref name=byu>{{cite web |title=McNamara's 43, man-to-man defense lead SU past BYU |first=Scott |last=Lieber |date=[[2004-03-19]]  |url=http://www.uwire.com/content/topsports031904001.html |work=The Daily Orange |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> 

Syracuse built a 16-point lead over the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in the second round; they  survived a furious [[Terrapins]] comeback in the 72-70 win.  In the [[Sweet Sixteen (NCAA Basketball Tournament)|Sweet 16]] McNamara had a game-high 24 points, but Syracuse couldn't overcome the [[University of Alabama]], 80-71.<ref name=0304season>{{cite web |title=2003-2004 Syracuse Orangemen |first=Ray |last=Young  |url=http://www.orangehoops.org/2003-2004.htm |work=Orangehoops.org |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> McNamara averaged 26.7 points in the three tournament games. 

=== Junior ===

In 2005 Syracuse finished 27-7 and captured the [[Big East]] post-season tournament title with a win over [[West Virginia University]]. McNamara averaged 15.8 points and was named to the First Team All-Big East. The fourth-seeded Orange suffered a shocking overtime upset in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to the [[University of Vermont]].  McNamara struggled through one of the worst games of his college career, scoring just 11 points and missing 14 of his 18 shots.<ref name=vermontupset>{{cite web |title=Vermont finds a slipper that fits, tops <U+2019>Cuse |date=[[2005-03-19]]  |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7235575/ |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

=== Senior ===

One of only two players left from the championship team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005-2006 regular season.  Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against [[Davidson College]], the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the [[Carrier Dome]], and a 30-point performance against the visiting [[Louisville Cardinals]].  Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.

Prior to the conference tournament two separate publications, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' conducted polls of Big East players and assistant coaches.  In each poll, McNamara was voted the Big East's "Most Overrated" player.<ref name=overrated1>{{cite web |title=McNamara's not overrated <U+2014> just ask Boeheim |first=Kara |last=Yorio |date=[[2006-03-08]]  |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=69931&highlight=&sid=ac61e8da8ab06a5c57ad802725ae9372 |work=The Sporting News |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref><ref name=overrated2>{{cite web |title=Is Gerry Overrated? |first=Ethan |last=Ramsey |date=[[2006-02-08]]  |url=http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2006/02/08/Sports/Is.Gerry.Overrated.Ramsey.Weaknesses.There.All.Along-1603530.shtml |work=The Daily Orange |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref><ref name=overrated3>{{cite web |title=McNamara keeps 'Cuse alive ... and Boeheim explodes |first=Luke |last=Winn |date=[[2006-03-08]]  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/luke_winn/03/08/cuse/index.html |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

Fueled by the negative press--and despite an injured leg--McNamara led Syracuse on an unprecedented run to the Big East tournament title.  In the first round he hit a three-point shot with less than a second left in the game to spur Syracuse past the [[University of Cincinnati]].  Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate defense of his star player to the attending media.<ref name=boeheimcurse>{{cite web |title=McNamara's miracle saves Syracuse |date=[[2006-03-08]]  |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060308_SYR@CIN |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

The next day McNamara hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds to tie number-one ranked [[University of Connecticut]] and eventually led Syracuse to an overtime upset.  McNamara finished with 17 points and 13 assists, one assist shy of the Big East Tournament record.<ref name=uconnupset>{{cite web |title=Gerry buries another clutch trey as Orange oust Huskies |date=[[2006-03-09]]  |url=http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060309_SYR@CT |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

Syracuse fell behind [[Georgetown University]] in the tournament's semi-finals, Syracuse's third game in three days.  McNamara hit five three-pointers in the second half--including one in the last minute of the game--to slash the Hoyas' lead to one.  He dished out an assist to freshman guard [[Eric Devendorf]] to put Syracuse in the lead following a Georgetown turnover and forced another turnover in the closing seconds to clinch the game.<ref name=BEgtownupset>{{cite web |title=McNamara magical again as Orange rally to advance to final |date=[[2006-03-10]]  |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060310_SYR@GTOWN/rss |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> 

McNamara had 14 points and 6 assists in Syracuse's 65-61 championship game win over the [[University of Pittsburgh]].  Syracuse became the first team to win four games in four days and capture the Big East Tournament Championship.<ref name=BEpittupset>{{cite web |title=Syracuse knocks off No. 15 Pitt for Big East title |date=[[2006-03-12]]  |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11785432/ |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> 

McNamara won the [[Dave Gavitt]] Award as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.  He donned a tee-shirt with the mocking retort, "Overrated?!!" as he helped cut down the nets.<ref name=overratedtshirt>{{cite web |title=A Tirade Sparked Syracuse's Surprise Run to the Title |first=Pete |last=Thamel |date=[[2006-03-13]]  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/sports/ncaabasketball/13bigeast.html?ei=5088&en=e05a2063f57845cf&ex=1299906000&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1146434625-GP9tbHqz7xTJ6CCV7LN77g |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

McNamara's career came to an unceremonious end in the first round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament.  Severely hobbled by his leg injury and exhausted from the run in the Big East tournament, he scored only two points in just 23 minutes of play as fifth-seeded Syracuse was upset by [[Texas A&M University]].  It marked the only game in his career McNamara was held without a field goal.  The Orange finished with a 23-12 record.<ref name=texasaandmupset>{{cite web |title=Texas A&M 66, Syracuse 58 |first=Mark |last=Long |date=[[2006-03-16]]  |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_basketball/20060316-2200-bkc-ncaa-texasa&m-syracuse.html |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

==College legacy==
McNamara started all 135 games he played in his four years and graduated with a degree in Communication and Rhetorical Studies in May 2006. A 2006 [[Associated Press]] Honorable Mention All-American, McNamara was named by Big East head coaches to the league's All-Freshman team in 2003, to the All Big East second team in 2004 and to the All Big East first team in 2005 and 2006.<ref name=suathletics />

His career statistics rank among the greats in Syracuse's school history.  He finished fourth in points scored (2099), first in minutes played (4781), second in steals (258), third in assists (648), first in three-point shots made (400) and attempted (1131), and first in career free-throw percentage (89.1%).<ref name=suathletics />

In 63 career Big East games, McNamara set conference records for three-pointers made (183) and career free-throw percentage (91.7%).  His 400 career three-pointers ranked sixth all-time in NCAA history.<ref name=suathletics />

McNamara was also named the 2006 winner of the [[Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award]].  The award is presented annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to a senior Division I men's player who demonstrates outstanding character, leadership, and talent.<ref name=chiphilton>{{cite web |title=Gerry McNamara aiming for NBA |date=[[2006-04-13]] |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/cbasketball/articles/20060413/729055-p.html |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

McNamara left Syracuse as one of the most beloved players in Orange basketball history; his final regular-season game at the [[Carrier Dome]] on [[March 5]], [[2006]], was the arena's first-ever advance sellout for a basketball game. The final attendance of 33,633, an all-time NCAA record for an on-campus regular-season game, included more than 3,000 fans -- dubbed "McNamara's Band" by the media -- from the Scranton area (according to media reports more than 60 buses made the two hour trip from Scranton to Syracuse for the game).<ref name=band>{{cite web |title=Tale of Two Cities |first=Adam |last=Kilgore |date=[[2006-01-31]]  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/sioncampus/01/31/gerry.mcnamara/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> Among those people coming up from Scranton were McNamara's parents, who were in attendence for every game in his college career.<ref name=recruiting /> Syracuse lost the game to highly-ranked [[Villanova University]], but an emotional McNamara led all scorers with 29 points.<ref name=villanova>{{cite web |title=One last ride with pride for the G-Mac convoy |first=Chris |last=Kelly |date=[[2006-03-04]]  |url=http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16239908&BRD=2185&PAG=461&dept_id=422126&rfi=6 |work=The Times-Tribune |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

McNamara's popularity continues to this date, as he can currently be seen in local television advertisements in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY, the most popular ad being for Fernandez Automall.<ref name=automall>{{cite web |title=Gerry McNamara to appear in Wolcott |first=Mike |last=Waters |date=[[2007-04-12]] |url=http://blog.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2007/04/gerry_mcnamara_to_appear_in_wo.html |work=The Post-Standard |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

==Team USA==
McNamara was one of 13 players who accepted invitations to attend the 2005 USA Basketball men<U+2019>s trials and training camp from [[July 28]]-[[August 4]], [[2005]]. The team, coached by Villanova<U+2019>s Jay Wright, won the gold medal at the World University Games in Izmir, Turkey.<ref name=suathletics />

McNamara played in all eight games and started four as the U.S. went a perfect 8-0. In those games, he averaged 8.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and a squad-best 2.6 assists per game. McNamara finished off the tournament with 13 points and five rebounds to help the Americans win the gold-medal game over previously unbeaten Ukraine, 85-70.<ref name=suathletics />

==Professional career==

McNamara wasn't drafted out of college, but he played summer league ball for the [[Orlando Magic]] in 2006. He was not offered an [[NBA]] contract. However, the [[Northeast Pennsylvania Breakers]] selected McNamara No. 1 overall in the 2006 [[United States Basketball League]] draft held on [[April 11]], 2006.<ref name=usbl>{{cite web |title=Breakers Take G-Mac in 2006 USBL Draft |date=[[2006-04-11]]  |url=http://www.usbl.com/currentNews.php?news_id=143 |work=USBL |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> He was also drafted in the sixth round of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] draft by the [[Albany Patroons]] on [[September 26]], 2006.  The Patroons will hold McNamara's rights until 2008.<ref name=patroons>{{cite web |title=Former Syracuse standout McNamara released by Greek team |date=[[2006-11-29]]  |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/europe/2006-11-29-mcnamara-release_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

On [[September 4]], [[2006]], he signed a one-year contract to play for Olympiacos BC, but only for 2006-2007 [[Euroleague]] games.  After playing just one minute in the team's first five games, McNamara reached a contract settlement and left the team and returned to the United States in November 2006.  It is estimated he was paid $90,000 for that one minute.<ref name=leavesgreece>{{cite web |title=McNamara back in U.S. after sour Greece experience |first=Chris |last=Mannix |date=[[2007-01-23]]  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/chris_mannix/01/23/mcnamara/index.html |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref>

On [[December 12]], [[2006]], McNamara signed with the [[Bakersfield Jam]], an [[NBDL]] team located in [[Bakersfield, California]]. McNamara was named as a reserve to the Western Conference's All-Star team and played in the [[Gillette]] D-League All-Star Game on [[February 17]], 2007, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

Unlike when he was with Olympiacos BC, he will be able to play in Euroleague games as well as the Greek league. McNamara will earn just over $400,000, which is roughly the same as a second-round draft pick in the NBA. <ref name=backtogreece />
