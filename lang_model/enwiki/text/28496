'''Osgyth''' (or '''Osyth''') (died 700 AD<ref>"Orthodox England," http://www.orthodoxengland.org.uk/saintso.htm, Accessed 7 October 2010</ref>) was an English [[saint]]. She is primarily commemorated in the village of [[St Osyth|Saint Osyth]], [[Essex]], near [[Colchester]]. Alternative spellings of her name include '''Sythe''', '''Othith''' and '''Ositha'''.

==Life==
Born in [[Quarrendon (village)|Quarrendon]], [[Buckinghamshire]] (at that time part of [[Mercia]]), she was the daughter of [[Frithuwold of Surrey|Frithwald]], a sub-king of Mercia in Surrey, and was the niece of [[St Edith|Saint Edith]] and [[Edburga of Bicester|Saint Edburga of Bicester]]. Her mother was Wilburga, the daughter of the [[paganism|pagan]] [[Penda of Mercia|King Penda of Mercia]].

Raised in a [[convent]] in [[Warwickshire]] under the direction of [[Saint Modwen]] her ambition was to become an [[abbess]], but she was too important as a dynastic pawn to be set aside. 

Forced by her father into a dynastic marriage with [[Sighere of Essex|Sighere]], [[Kingdom of Essex|King of Essex]], she did her dynastic duty and produced him a son. While her husband ran off to hunt down a beautiful white stag, Osgyth persuaded two local bishops to accept her vows as a nun. Then, eventually, perhaps after Sighere's death, she established a convent at [[Chich]], in Essex, where she ruled as first abbess.

She was murdered by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Viking]] marauders in 700.

Her death was accounted a [[martyrdom]] by some, but [[Bede]] makes no mention of Saint Osgyth. The 13th-century chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] repeats some of the legend that had accrued around her name. The site of her martyrdom became transferred to the holy spring at [[Quarrendon (village)|Quarrendon]]. The holy spring at Quarrendon, mentioned in the time of Osgyth's aunts, now became associated with her legend, in which Osgyth stood up after her execution, picking up her head like [[Denis|Saint Denis]] in Paris, and other [[Cephalophore|cephalophoric martyrs]] and walking with it in her hands, to the door of a local convent, before collapsing there. Some modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands<ref name=White>Note: "The stories of St. Edmund, St. Kenelm, St. Osgyth, and St. Sidwell in England, St. Denis in France, St. Melor and St. Winifred in Celtic territory, preserve the pattern and strengthen the link between [[legend]] and [[folklore]]," Beatrice White observes. (White 1972:123). White, Beatrice, "A Persistent Paradox" Folklore 83.2 (Summer 1972), pp. 122-131, at p. 123.</ref> to the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] cult of heads.

==Veneration==
Later, the manor of Chich (now St Osyth) in Essex was assumed as part of his royal [[demesne]] by the [[Danes (ancient people)|Dane]] [[Canute|King Canute]], who granted it to [[Earl Godwin]], and by him it was given to [[Canterbury Cathedral|Christ Church]], [[Canterbury]]. At the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] it was transferred to the [[Bishop of London|Bishopric of London]].

On the site of a former nunnery at Chich, Richard de Belmeis of London, in the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] founded a priory for [[Augustinian Canons|canons of Saint Augustine]], and dedicated it to Saint Osgyth; his remains were buried in the chancel of the church in 1127: he bequeathed the church and tithes to the canons, who elected as their first abbot or prior [[William de Corbeil]], afterwards [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (died in 1136). 

His benefactions, and charters and privileges granted by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], made the Canons wealthy: at the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1536, its revenues were valued at <U+00A3>758 5s. 8d. yearly. In 1397 the abbot of St Osgyth was granted the right to wear a [[mitre]] and give the solemn benediction, and, more singularly, the right to ordain priests, conferred by [[Pope Boniface IX]].<ref>Egerton Beck, "Two Bulls of Boniface IX for the Abbot of St. Osyth" ''The English Historical Review'' '''26'''.101 (January 1911:124-127).</ref> The gatehouse (''illustrated''), the so-called 'Abbot's Tower' and some ranges of buildings remain.

Osgyth's burial site at Saint Mary's Church in [[Aylesbury]] became a site of great, though unauthorized [[pilgrimage]]; following a papal decree in 1500, the bones were removed from the church and buried in secret. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913) gives Saint Osgyth no mention. Undeterred, according to the curious  17th-century antiquary [[John Aubrey]] (author of the ''Brief Lives''), "in those days, when they went to bed they did rake up the fire, and make a X on the ashes, and pray to God and Saint Sythe<ref>That is, Saint Osgyth.</ref> to deliver them from fire, and from water, and from all misadventure." A house in Aylesbury is still called Saint Osgyth's House in her honour. 

Her [[feast day]] is 7 October. She is normally depicted [[cephalophore|carrying her own head]].
