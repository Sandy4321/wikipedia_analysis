Expressways in [[South Korea]] were originally numbered in order of construction.  Since [[August 24]], [[2001]], they have been numbered in a scheme somewhat similar to that of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the [[United States]]:

* Arterial routes are designated by two-digit route numbers, with north-south routes having odd numbers, and east-west routes having even numbers.  Primary routes (i.e. major thoroughfares) have five and zero as their last digits respectively, while lesser (secondary) routes have various final digits.

* Branch routes have three-digit route numbers, where the first two digits match the route number of an arterial route.

* Belt lines have three-digit route numbers where the first digit matches the respective city's postal code.

* Route numbers in the range 70-99 are not used in South Korea and are reserved for designations in the event of [[Korean reunification]].

* The [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] kept its Route 1 designation, as it is [[South Korea]]'s first and most important expressway.
