==Synopsis==
During the Summer of 2011, the original ''Starlight Spectacular'' show was shown which mainly took place on Wonder Mountain. The show was the same every night with no major differences from night to night. During Canada's Wonderland 2011 Halloween Haunt, a similar show was put onto Wonder Mountain "blending in" with the Halloween Haunt theme. Below is a description of the events that happened during both shows.

===2011 Regular Season===
[[File:Starlight Spectacular at Canada's Wonderland 4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scene from Starlight Spectacular at Canada's Wonderland.|The dinosaur scene in the Starlight Spectacular Show immediately after the "spring" scene.]]
The show began by a single maple leaf flying around Wonder Mountain. Then, along with the single leaf, many more leafs began to fly around the mountain eventually disappearing at the bottom of the mountain. The mountain would then go completely dark and shortly after snow would begin to fall freezing around the mountain causing it to look frozen. Then, the mountain slowly began to transition into the "spring" season where the snow began to disappear, plants began to grow and finally a rainbow formed around the mountain. Butterflies began to fly around the mountain completing the "spring" scene for the show. The music than became more intense and the "spring" scene disappeared leaving what looked like a dark mountain. Fake lightning than began to flash and parts of the mountain began "exploding" poring out lava. A fake lightning bolt would than strike a part of the mountain leaving a big hole in the mountain. Two yellow eyes came out of the mountain and a dinosaur like creature stepped out screaming and eventually blowing fire around the mountain. The scene ended when the blowing fire covered up the entire mountain. Next, three white lights would begin to fly around the mountain eventually covering the mountain in a dark blue colour. Almost immediately after the blue colour appeared, a white box appearrd in the centre of the mountain. The box than split into three different boxes each with a their own colour (blue, green and red). The green box than began to spill out smaller green cubes. Shortly after, the blue box would begin to spill out smaller blue cubes followed by the red box. The boxes then disintegrated into medium sized white cubes which would fall over the edge of Wonder Mountain. Once all the cubes finished falling over the edge, the entire mountain became covered in red squares, then turning into green squares and finally blue squares. The blue squares began to move "in and out" and do the "wave". The blue squares would than disappear followed by the mountain being flooded by white squares. A few seconds later, all the squares would crumble down to the bottom of the mountain. Then the mountain began to look like it was moving up and down, left and right and tilting (the mountain itself was actually not moving). Then, once again a number of cubes appeared, moving in all directions. Then, three "strings" which have the colours blue, green and red began flying around the mountain. The mountain would than "collapse" leading on to the next scene. At the beginning of the next scene, the mountain was completely "invisible" and one by one parts of the top portion of mountain began to appear and begin "moving" and make the sound as if a the mountain was a giant machine. Then at the bottom half of Wonder Mountain, moving gears began to appear showing that the mountain was in fact a machine. A white light began moving around the gears. The top of the mountain suddenly began to move faster and faster with the gears become bigger. The white light than left the mountain and spilt up into two different lights one that was green and once that was aqua blue. '''From this point on, the show was now focused around Canada's Wonderland's 30th Birthday.''' The two lights formed a red light which then (all three lights) turned into "strings". Smaller lights and more "strings" began to appear. Then more small lights (of all colours) appeared and began to fall down the mountain. The music would get some what more intense and more lights would appear. The fountains and trees in front of Wonder Mountain would then begin to "dance" to the music right until the show ended. Blue lights than appeared on the two largest waterfalls on the mountain. The blue lights changed colours and jellyfish like images began to appear beside the waterfalls. Than, the mountain immediately changed scenes and the mountain began flashing colours all over the mountain. Rainbow designs flashed around the mountain and "strings" re-appeared. The mountain than created a multi-colour image where all the colours kept changing never showing the same thing. The images would go away and colours would imitate the four the waterfalls on Wonder Mountain. After, a giant disco ball appeared and simulated what a real disco ball would do. The disco ball than fell to the bottom of the mountain and a number of white circles began bouncing around the mountain. After the circles disappear, chains of multi-coloured stars began flying around the mountain. Animated fireworks would than begin to explode on the mountain. Animated balloons followed along with the fireworks. Than, the dinosaur like creature from the beginning of the show re-appeared and began to dance. The dinosaur would disappeared shortly after and soon after the words ''"Happy 30th Birthday Canada's Wonderland"'' along with more animated fireworks and balloons would appear on Wonder Mounatin. The show lasted 10 minutes and 30 seconds.<ref name="Tantrum show">{{cite web|url=http://throwatantrum.tv/wonderland/ |title=Canada's Wonderland Starlight Spectacular Video |publisher=Tantrum Design |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/628RYXNC5  |archivedate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>

===2011 Halloween Haunt===
''Not much is known of the full show that is currently showing on Wonder Mountain ever night during the event, but '''only''' the scenes that are confirmed are mentioned below.''

Throughout the entire night, a spotlight moves around the mountain. After a certain amount of time, a quick flash goes off and worm-like creatures begin to crawl around the mountain. After a little while, the "worms" would leave the mountain and the spotlight would reaper. Then, the mountain flash again and transition the scene to what looks like a dark mountain (similar to the frozen mountain scene in the original show) and continue to flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1095856#p1095856 |title=Wonder Mountain During Halloween Haunt (Skip to 1:57) |publisher=Theme Park Review |date=October 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Projection & Sound==
[[File:CW Starlight Spectacular Projectors.jpg|thumb|155px|The four projectors used during the Starlight Spectacular show in 2011.]]
The ''Starlight Spectacular'' show used four [[Christie (company)|Christe]] projectors located just in front of the bridge that crosses the fountain pool. The projectors are sealed in a weather proof box with a window in front of the projector so the projections can make it to the mountain. The type of projectors used from Christie are still not known. The music and sound which was played during the show was created by Apollo Studios which is located in Montreal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signmedia.ca/smc2/newsletters/139-july-25-2011/712-mountain-sized-screen-marks-canadas-wonderland-anniversary |title=Mountain-sized screen marks Canada's Wonderland anniversary |publsiher=Sign Media Canada |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>
