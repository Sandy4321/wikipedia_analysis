==Biography==
A native of [[Ibaraki prefecture]], Iimura graduated from the 21st class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1909, and was assigned to the [[Imperial Guard of Japan|Imperial Guards 3rd Regiment]]. Simultaneously, he also attended class work at the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]], graduating in March 1917 with a degree in [[French language|French]]. He then entered the 33rd class of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]], emerging in 1919 as a captain in the [[infantry]]. After a short assignment with the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea]] and as an instructor at the Army Staff College, he was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] and assigned as [[military attach<U+00E9>]] to [[Turkey]]. <ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref>

After Iimura returned to Japan, he was promoted to [[colonel]] in August 1932 and served in various staff positions within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]]. He was given a field position as commander of the IJA 61st Infantry Regiment in March 1935.  <ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>

With the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Iimura was promoted in March 1937 to [[major general]]. He was Commandant of the Army Staff College from 1938-1939, and transferred to [[Manchukuo]] to become [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff)]] of the [[Kwangtung Army]] from 1939-1940. He subsequently became [[commander in chief]] of the [[Japanese Fifth Army|IJA 5th Army]] in Manchukuo from 1941-1943. <ref>Wendel, Axis History Database</ref>

Iijuma was recalled to Japan in 1943 to resume his position as Commandant of the Army Staff College, but with the situation continuing to deteriorate for the Japanese in the southern front of the [[Pacific War]], he was reassigned to a combat command as Chief of Staff of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group|IJA Southern Army]] in 1944, and Commander in Chief of the [[Japanese Second Area Army|IJA 2nd Area Army]], based in the [[Celebes]], [[Netherlands East Indies]] from 1944-1945. <ref>/Wendel, Axis History Database</ref>

He returned to Japan shortly before the end of the war to assume command of the [[Tokyo Defense Army]] and [[Tokyo Divisional District]] in anticipation of the American invasion of the Japanese home islands. He was appointed [[Provost Marshal]] immediately before the end of the war in 1945.
