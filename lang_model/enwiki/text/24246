'''William De Kova White''' (born [[January 28]] [[1934]] in [[Lakewood, Florida]]) is a former [[sportscaster]] and [[professional baseball]] [[first baseman]] who played for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York and San Francisco Giants]] ([[1956 in baseball|1956]], [[1958 in baseball|1958]]), [[St. Louis Cardinals]] ([[1959 in baseball|1959]]-[[1965 in baseball|65]], [[1969 in baseball|1969]]) and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] ([[1966 in baseball|1966]]-[[1968 in baseball|68]]). He went on to serve as president of the [[National League]] from 1989 to 1994.

As a minor-leaguer, White was the second black player to ever play for a [[Carolina League]] team - the Danville Leafs (1953). [[Percy Miller Jr.]] broke the color barrier for that league in 1951. In his 13-season major league career, White [[batting average|batted]] .286 with 202 [[home run]]s and 870 [[run batted in|RBI]] in 1673 games. He also was considered one of the top defensive first basemen of his time, winning seven successive [[Gold Glove Awards]] (1960-66). White batted and threw lefthanded.

White didn't really have to move to move on to a career as a sportscaster, because he had a sports program on [[KMOX]] while he was still playing for the Cardianals. After he was traded to the Phillies, he did a program there.doing some non play-by-play work in [[Philadelphia]], White joined the [[New York Yankees]] broadcast crew. He called Yankee games from [[1971 in baseball|1971]] to [[1988 in baseball|1988]], primarily with [[Phil Rizzuto]] and [[Frank Messer]] - doing [[radio]] as well as [[television]] during most of that stretch. He was the first [[African-American]] to do [[play-by-play]] regularly for a major-league sports team. 

On New York City radio, he was on [[WMCA]] from 1971 to 1977, after which the Yankees switched over to [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]. In 1981, the Yankee broadcast team moved over to [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]. 

On television, White spent all of his Yankee years announcing the [[Bronx Bombers]] with Rizzuto and Messer on WPIX-TV.

In [[1978 in baseball|1978]], calling the American League East championship game on WPIX-TV, White authored one of baseball's most famous calls -- that of Yankee shortstop [[Bucky Dent]]'s [[home run]] in the seventh inning against the host [[Boston Red Sox]]:
{{cquote|Deep to left! [[Carl Yastrzemski|Yastrzemski]] will not get it -- it's a home run! A three-run home run for Bucky Dent and the Yankees now lead it by a score of three to two!}}

White also did sports reports for the [[CBS Radio Network]] and helped call several [[World Series]] for CBS Radio (along with [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] announcer [[Ross Porter (American broadcaster)|Ross Porter]] and later, [[Jack Buck]]). He also did pre-game reports for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] coverage of the 1977 Series, also along with Porter, and handled the post-game trophy presentation for ABC after the Yanks clinched the world title in the sixth game.

From [[1989 in baseball|1989]] to [[1994 in baseball|1994]], White served as president of the [[National League]]. White was the first African- American to hold such a high executive position in sports.
