'''''She Has a Name''''' is a play about [[human trafficking]] written by [[Andrew Kooman]] in 2009 as a one-act play and expanded to a full-length play in 2010. The play is about the [[trafficking of children]] into [[sexual slavery]] in order to [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|exploit them commercially as prostitutes]] in the [[child sex tourism]] industry and was inspired by the deaths of 54 people in the [[Ranong human-trafficking incident]]. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of ''She Has a Name'' was directed by [[Stephen Waldschmidt]] at the [[EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta in February 2011. Performances ran from February 23 until March 12 in both Calgary and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], all of which sold out. From May to October 2012, ''She Has a Name'' [[2012 tour of She Has a Name|toured across Canada]]. In conjunction with the tour, [[A Better World]] raised money to help women and children who had been [[Human trafficking in Thailand|trafficked in Thailand]] as part of [[Prostitution in Thailand|the country's prostitution industry]]. After the Saturday matin<U+00E9>e in each city, there was a panel discussion to raise awareness about human trafficking.

Five actors portray ten characters. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old and has been a prostitute for six years. The drama centers around Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into [[Bangkok]]. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect that traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is [[Human branding|branded]] onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into [[Abolitionism#Contemporary abolitionism|contemporary abolitionists]].

The play received strong endorsement from Canadian [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]], including [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|MP]] [[Joy Smith]], [[Ratanak International]]'s [[Brian McConaghy]], and [[International Justice Mission|IJM]] Canada's [[Jamie McIntosh]]. The play's premiere and initial run were critically acclaimed. In the 2012 tour across Canada, the play was performed in several [[fringe theatre]] festivals, at which critics representing ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', and [[CFEQ-FM]] said it stood out for its quality and moral content.

After starting to write the play, Kooman read about the [[Ranong human-trafficking incident]] in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and was only discovered after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or [[hyperthermia]].<ref name=Bundle1>For the time of Kooman's reading about the incident, see {{Cite journal|journal=[[CFUV-FM]]|title=She Has a Name|url=http://cfuvfringefestival.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/she-has-a-name/|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}

==Characters==
[[File:She Has a Name 2011 - Voices.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a kneeling woman wearing a jean skirt surrounded by three other women in white cloaks staring at her all in front of a painted backdrop|The voices have been variously considered [[angel]]s or ghosts, and are sometimes frightening and at other times consoling.]]

While there are ten different characters in the play, the script calls for only five actors:<ref name=Fast/> four females and one male.<ref name=Audition>{{cite web|publisher=Calgary Arts Development|title=Audition Notice - She Has A Name|author=James Popoff|date=August 24, 2010|url=http://www.calgaryartsdevelopment.com/content/audition-notice-she-has-name|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}</ref> The play's main characters are Jason and Number 18. Jason is a young, Canadian lawyer with experience in corporate law. He found this work unsatisfying, so he started working in international human rights law for the United Nations and a non-governmental organization (NGO) that opposes sex trafficking. Number 18{{mdash}}the play's heroine{{mdash}}is a young, female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old and has been a prostitute for six years. Ali is Jason's beautiful wife, and the couple have two young daughters. Marta is Jason's employer, who has become very tough from years of fighting for justice and who is now driven and stressed. The other characters are an unnamed pimp and Mama, his assistant who is a cruel [[mama-san|brothel keeper]].

Both of the male characters{{mdash}}Jason and the pimp{{mdash}}are played by the same actor.<ref name=Calgary>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Calgary Sun]]|author=Louis Hobson|date=May 4, 2012|title=Actor makes Name in trafficking play|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/05/04/actor-makes-name-in-trafficking-play|accessdate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> Jason and Number 18 are haunted by the voices of four female sex slaves who have died. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve much the same purpose as a [[Greek chorus]] in [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]].<ref name=Advocate/> Variously considered angels<ref name=Uptown>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Uptown (newspaper)|Uptown]]|date=July 21, 2012|title=Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival 2012 reviews |url=http://www.uptownmag.com/arts/features/WINNIPEG-FRINGE-THEATRE-FESTIVAL-REVIEWS-163282806.html|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> or ghosts,<ref name=Preachy/> the voices are played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama.<ref name=Nicholls/> While these voices emphasize the horrors of the sex industry, they also empower Number 18, comforting her as divine messengers. The fact that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes is revealed only at the end of the play.

==Plot summary==
[[File:She Has a Name 2012 - Pimp.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A photograph of five people, three of whom are wearing white cloaks, one of whom is wearing a red shirt, and the remaining one of whom is holding a gun|Number 18 is regularly abused despite being her pimp's favourite prostitute.]]

In a bar, Number 18 is being raped by a pimp who then makes her his sex slave. Number 18's father died while she was still young, and her family found it difficult to support her. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia, replaced her name with a number, and used her as a child prostitute, moving her between countries and prostituting her. Number 18 eventually ends up in the [[Child prostitution in Thailand|Thai child prostitution industry]]. Number 18 services mostly rich men, many of whom are foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays that a man will eventually come to save her from these circumstances. At the same time, she has become the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and is her pimp's favourite worker. While she has become very knowledgeable about and proficient in pleasing men sexually, she is also childlike and dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.

Jason has left his wife and children in Canada, a high-paying job and a career path that could have led to a partnership at his father-in-law's law firm to start working with an NGO in Thailand. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and to then shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked. Jason's boss, Marta, sends him into the brothels because she cannot go in herself. Jason's wife Ali communicates with him over [[Skype]].

As he infiltrates an Asia-wide brothel ring, Jason's specific focus is the ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok, where the brothels prostitute them through the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck containing the bodies of dead sex workers has been discovered. Jason is trying to build a legal case against the brothel ring. He pays to see various prostitutes hoping that one of them witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he visits is Number 18, and he is very nervous. Number 18 is very attractive and ready to please, and she tries to seduce Jason. Jason does not want the [[girlfriend experience]], and thinks that she could be a key witness, so he tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The other captives in the brothels Jason infiltrates are too afraid to testify in the case. Number 18 consents to answer some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but she only agrees to answer these questions if Jason is willing to pay her 100 [[Thai baht|baht]] for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in brothels in Thailand and Malaysia.

[[File:She Has a Name 2011 - Death.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of four people, the leftmost three of whom are women wearing white cloaks and the remaining person being a kneeling man|Ultimately, the characters are trapped in a [[no-win situation]], and the play ends in catastrophe.]]

Number 18 turns out to be one of the girls who were trafficked in the storage truck, but she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Number 18 is traumatized and does not understand what Jason wants. Testifying against the ring would endanger her life; every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed. Her first reaction to Jason's questions is to try to silence him and get him to leave. One night, Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and is barely able to walk when Jason visits her. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to return to Canada. However, Jason believes that he is in Bangkok by [[divine providence]]. Once Number 18 understands that Jason is unlike the other men who frequent The Pearl, she learns to trust him as a friend, agrees to testify against the brothel ring, and is willing to be rescued. Jason's next challenge is to rescue her from The Pearl. He pays the Number 18's pimp enough money to take her away from the brothel for a weekend. In the meantime, Mama finds and confiscates the baht Jason had paid Number 18; Mama then correctly suspects that the weekend Jason has paid for is a trick. When Jason arrives to pick up Number 18, Mama tells him Number 18 has died and offers him a refund. Not believing that Number 18 is dead, Jason resorts to violence and Mama mocks him for being part of the rich Western culture that is responsible for members of the [[Third World]] becoming victims of sex trafficking. Jason stops short of hurting Mama and leaves the brothel, going to tell Marta what happened. Marta, through her network of connections, discovers that Number 18 is still alive. Although she sees Number 18 as evidence rather than as a person, Marta steps in and risks her life for Number 18, posing as a lawyer protecting Number 18's rights. The pimp is not fooled, and he threatens Marta with a gun, forcing her to leave the area. Jason manages to make his way to Number 18, but the pimp kills her before Jason is able to rescue her. Number 18 then joins the chorus of dead child prostitutes who have been watching over and commenting on all of the events up until this point.

Kooman said that the massive proportions of human trafficking often prevent people from dealing with it; he therefore chose to portray a single trafficked victim in the play so that audiences could approach the subject on a more workable level.<ref name=Advocate/> He hoped that audiences would avoid getting stuck in the statistics of human trafficking and would connect with a personal story.<ref name=Anchor/> The two questions that propel the story are: "Can [Jason] convince [Number 18] to risk her life to testify for the sake of justice?" and "Can he save her from the unthinkable circumstances?".<ref name=PGC/> Jason is weary and,<ref name=Sun/> while he never falls into self-pity,<ref name=Lana/> he comes to hate himself for his inability to save Number 18 from her slavery<ref name=Sun/> because he lacks the evidence he requires for his case to be successful in court.<ref name=Lana/> Much of the play is concerned with demonstrating the immensity of the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18.<ref name=Nicholls/> For example, he finds it difficult to be away from his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue to work on the case or whether to return to Canada.<ref name=Threat>{{Cite journal|journal=Art Threat|author=Amanda McCuaig|date=September 11, 2012|title=She Has a Name leaves you breathless: Play on human trafficking touches without playing the guilt card|url=http://artthreat.net/2012/09/she-has-a-name-fringe/|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref> In order to depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another.

This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack.<ref name=Preachy/> Lana Michelin of the ''Red Deer Advocate'' said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father.<ref name=Lana/>  Anna Borowiecki of the ''St. Albert Gazette'' called the play a story of "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions".<ref name=Anna/>
[[File:She Has a Name 2011 - Embrace.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a man wearing a blue dress shirt and blue jeans and looking into the eyes of a woman wearing a brown shirt and a blue jean skirt|[[Aaron Krogman]] portrayed both Jason and the pimp in the premiere, and stated that "both characters are struggling with power and how they use it".]]

Denise Wong, the [[List of people from Calgary|Calgarian]] actor who portrayed Number 18 in the premiere,<ref name=Advocate/> said that the play was about the [[human condition]].<ref name=Fast/> Evelyn Chew, the [[List of people from Vancouver|Vancouverite]] actor who took over the role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and builds in intensity to its climax.<ref name=Chronicle/> Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking.<ref name=Ignite>{{Cite journal|title=Where is God at the Fringe?|journal=[[CFEQ-FM]]|date=July 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=CFUV/> The character of Mama calls attention to the fact that poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking.<ref name=Lana/> Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn,<ref name=Strathmore/> thereby turning them into [[Abolitionism#Contemporary abolitionism|contemporary abolitionists]].<ref name=Returns/> He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[CKOM]]|author=Stephanie Froese|date=April 21, 2012|title=She Has a Name puts face to sexual slavery in Saskatoon|url=http://www.newstalk650.com/story/she-has-name-puts-face-sexual-slavery-saskatoon/53480|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents.<ref name=Strathmore/> Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play<ref name=Returns/> and said that if the play was a film, it would receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]]<ref name=Strathmore/> and would be billed a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]].<ref name=Fast/> He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic.<ref name=Gauntlet/> Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage ''She Has a Name'' partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.<ref name=Advocate/>

The ''Country Sunrise News'' stated that the drama has a fast pace.<ref name=Sunrise/> Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News argued that, while ''She Has a Name'' is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh.<ref name=Community>{{Cite journal|journal=London Community News|title=Sex trafficking highlighted in She Has a Name, playing July 12<U+2013>13 at the Aeolian|author=Mallory Clarkson|date=July 11, 2012|url=http://www.londoncommunitynews.com/2012/07/sex-trafficking-highlighted-in-she-has-a-name-playing-july-12-13-at-the-aeolian/|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> Similarly, Lana Michelin of the ''Red Deer Advocate'' asserted that the play's sporadic humourous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls.<ref name=Advocate/> Kooman stated that he tried to write the play in a way that would shock audiences without disturbing them to the point that they would not recommend it to friends.<ref name=Playwright/> Marlo Campbell, a writer for ''[[Uptown (newspaper)|Uptown]]'', said that the play critiques masculine egotism and Western heroism through the character of Jason.<ref name=Uptown/> Lana Michelin of the ''Red Deer Advocate'' disagreed, stating that Jason never lapses into self-importance.<ref name=Lana/> Aaron Krogman, who portrayed Jason and the pimp in the play's premiere, said, "there is a thin line between Jason and the pimp&nbsp;...&nbsp;both characters are struggling with power and how they use it".<ref name=Standard/> Waldschmidt stated that the doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are Canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking<ref name=Project/> and that it "is not just somebody else's problem over there&nbsp;...&nbsp;but that it's us, and it's in our country and in our backyard and in our suburbs".<ref name=CFUV/> Jason has in this way been considered an everyman.<ref name=Plank>{{Cite journal|journal=Plank Magazine|author=Lisa Barrett|title=She Has A Name|date=September 8, 2012 |url=http://plankmagazine.com/review/she-has-name|accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref> One critic said that the play's Bangkok setting allows Canadians to easily disassociate from the issue.<ref name=Mennonite/> Liz Nicholls of the ''Edmonton Journal'' wrote that the pimp character "represents the ruthless spirit of pure human greed".<ref name=Nicholls/> Stephen Pederson of ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'' called the play a combination of idealism, realism, and lyricism.<ref name=Preachy>{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Chronicle Herald]]|author=Stephen Pedersen|title=Preachy tone blunts power of She Has a Name|date=July 5, 2012|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/113898-preachy-tone-blunts-power-of-she-has-a-name|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> Dustin Wiebe of the ''Mennonite Brethren Herald'' wrote that the play shows "the darker side of man<U+2019>s desire for control" by presenting Number 18 as having been stripped of her humanity.<ref name=Mennonite>{{Cite journal|journal=Mennonite Brethren Herald|author=Dustin Wiebe|title=A unsettling look into human trafficking: She Has a Name|url=http://www.mbconf.ca/home/products_and_services/resources/publications/mb_herald/september_2012/crosscurrents/current_play/|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> The disaster that concludes the play is [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] throughout;<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=July 21, 2012|author=Anna Lazowski|title=She Has a Name |url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/scene/fringe/2012/07/she-has-a-name.html|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> the play both starts and ends with a depiction of the reality of contemporary slavery.<ref name=Winnipeg/>

Critical response to ''She Has a Name'' began with initial readings of the play at the 2009 Scripts At Work workshop, where the script was given the Scripts At Work/[[Alberta Playwrights Network]] Award.<ref name=Express/> The play has since become very successful<ref name=Weber/> and was endorsed by Canadian abolitionists including MP Joy Smith, Ratanak International's Brian McConaghy, and [[International Justice Mission|IJM]] Canada's [[Jamie McIntosh]].<ref name=Award>{{Cite journal|journal=Red Deer Express|author=Mark Weber|date=June 20, 2012|title=RDC alumnus receives provincial award of excellence}}</ref> Lara Quarterman, director of the Calgary chapter of [[ACT Alberta]], said she was concerned that ''She Has a Name'' suggests that human trafficking is limited to the sex trafficking of women and children in Thailand, but there is sexual-slavery-related human trafficking in Canada, and there is also human trafficking for the purposes of [[unfree labour]].<ref name=Times/> The Greek chorus of dead human-trafficking victims has generally received negative reviews; one critic called it "the play's least successful device".<ref name=Nicholls/>

The play's premiere and initial run were more critically acclaimed than expected. The religious community's reviews of the initial run were also positive.<ref name=Huntley/> After the first performances in 2011, Louis Hobson of the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' said the character of Marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn't "ring true" because of how she was written rather than how Warkentin performed her.<ref name=Sun/> The character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well-rounded and kind before the 2012 cross-Canada tour.<ref name=Beat/> In the 2012 tour, the play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing ''The Gazette'',<ref name=Fringe/> the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'',<ref name=Winnipeg/> and [[CFEQ-FM]] said it stood out for its quality and moral content.<ref name=Ignite/> The writing of the play was praised; one critic from ''Victoria News'' wrote that the play demonstrates that Kooman has a "gift for creating powerful, believable dialogue that can draw an audience in".<ref name=Victoria/> Liz Nicholls of the ''Edmonton Journal'' called the performances compelling.<ref name=Nicholls/> Karen Nelson, also of the ''Edmonton Journal'', called the play "sobering" in such a way that she was caused "to wonder what [she] could do about this global epidemic of abuse of children, women and the disenfranchised".<ref name=Nelson>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Edmonton Journal]]|author=Karen Nelson|title=Play exposes global sex trade|date=September 28, 2012|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/opinion/Saturday+letters+Ambrose+should+applauded+following+conscience/7317758/story.html|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>
