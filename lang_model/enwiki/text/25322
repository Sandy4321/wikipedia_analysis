The 141 W. Jackson address hosted the former [[List of tallest buildings in Chicago|tallest building in Chicago]] designed by [[William W. Boyington]] before the current [[Holabird & Roche|Holabird & Root]] structure, which held the same title for over 35 years.<ref name=z26>Zaloom, p. 26</ref> The current structure is known for its [[art deco]] architecture, sculptures and large-scale [[stone carving]], as well as large [[trading floor]]s.  A three-story art deco statue of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], goddess of grain, caps the building.  The building is a popular sightseeing attraction and location for shooting movies, and its owners and management have won awards for efforts to [[Historic preservation|preserve]] the building and for office management.

==Early history==
===Early locations===
On [[April 3]] [[1848]], the Chicago Board of Trade opened for business at 101 S. Water Street. When 122 members were added in 1856, it was moved to the corner of South Water and [[LaSalle Street]]s. After another temporary relocation west on South Water Street in 1860, the first permanent home was established within the [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] Building on the corner of LaSalle and Washington Streets in 1865. In 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed this building. The exchange temporarily reopened two weeks after the fire in a {{Ft to m|90|90|abbr=yes}} wooden building known as "[[Wigwam (Chicago)|the Wigwam]]" at the intersection of Washington and Market Streets,<ref name=CBOTHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/page/0,3181,942,00.html|title=Our History|accessdate = 2007-07-14|publisher=Chicago Board of Trade|date=2007}}</ref> before reclaiming its home in a new building constructed at the Chamber of Commerce site one year later.

===Permanent home===
In 1882, construction began of the CBOT's new home, which opened at the current location on [[May 1]] [[1885]]. It was designed by [[William W. Boyington]], known previously for his work on the [[Chicago Water Tower]]. Built from structural steel and [[Maine]] [[granite]], with a rear of [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] brick, it was 10&nbsp;stories tall and featured a tower {{Ft to m|320|abbr=yes}} tall containing a large clock and {{Weight|lb=4500}} bell, topped by a {{Ft to m|9|8|abbr=yes}} copper weather vane in the shape of a ship. Construction cost $1.8&nbsp;million. With four elevators and a great hall {{Ft to m|80|abbr=yes}} high decorated by a stained-glass skylight and ornate stone [[baluster]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/depts/ahaa/imagebase/intranet/chiviews/page153.html|title=Vicinity of the Board of Trade (12.

==Building details==
===Architecture===
In 1925, the Chicago Board of Trade commissioned [[Holabird & Root]] to design the current building. The [[general contractor]]s Hegeman & Harris built it for $11.3&nbsp;millon, although the reported twenty-year mortgage value was $12&nbsp;millon.<ref>Bruegmann, p. 23</ref><ref>Bruegmann, p. 34</ref> [[Cladding|Clad]] in gray [[Indiana]] [[limestone]], topped with a copper pyramid roof, and standing on a site running {{Ft to m|174|abbr=yes}} east<U+2013>west on Jackson Boulevard and {{Ft to m|240|abbr=yes}} north<U+2013>south on LaSalle Street, the {{Ft to m|605|abbr=yes}} tall art deco-styled building opened on [[June 9]] [[1930]]. It serves as the southern border for the skyscrapers hugging LaSalle Street and is taller than surrounding structures for several blocks. The Chicago Board of Trade has operated continuously on its twelfth floor since the 1930 opening, dedicating {{ft2 to m2|19000|precision=0}} to what was then the world's largest trading floor.<ref name=FIM>{{cite web|url=http://www.futuresindustry.org/fimagazi-1929.asp?a=607&iss=93|title=History of CBOT|accessdate = 2007-07-14|author=Gidel, Susan Abbott|publisher=futuresindustry.org|work=Futures Industry Magazine|date=December 1999/January 2000}}</ref> The advent of [[steel frame]] [[structural system]]s allowed completely vertical construction; but as with many [[skyscraper]]s of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly lit by floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements.  The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the [[Wrigley Building|Wrigley]], [[Jewelers Building|Jewelers]], [[Palmolive Building|Palmolive]] and [[LaSalle-Wacker Building|LaSalle-Wacker]] buildings and [[Tribune Tower]].<ref name=TSTL>Saliga, Pauline A. (ed.), p. 113.</ref> [[Interior decoration]] includes polished surfaces throughout, the use of black and white [[marble]], prominent vertical hallway trim, and an open three-story lobby which at the time of opening housed the world's largest [[light fixture]].  Though One LaSalle Street had five more floors, the CBOT building was the first in Chicago to exceed a height of {{Ft to m|600|abbr=yes}}. After surpassing the [[Chicago Temple Building]], it was the tallest in Chicago until the [[Richard J. Daley Center]] was completed in 1965. Known for its work on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], the family-operated factory of [[John A. Roebling]] supplied all of the cables used in the building's 23 [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis elevators]].<ref name=wirerope>{{cite web |url= http://cameo.njit.edu/urbanparks/trenton_competition/background/abriefhistory.pdf |format = PDF | title= A Brief History of Trenton | accessdate = 2007-08-04|author=Lane, Sally|publisher=New Jersy Institute of Tecnhology}}</ref><ref name=wirerope2>{{cite web| url= http://www.nyscss.org/resources/publications/Docket/pdfs/3_2-LOCAL-History.pdf | format = PDF | title= Social Science Docket |accessdate = 2007-08-04|publisher=New York and New Jersey State Councils for Social Studies}}</ref>   Beneath the main trading floor over {{mi to km|2700}} of telephone and [[telegraph]] wires were once hidden.  No less than {{mi to km|150000}} of wires (considered possibly the most direct long-distance wire from any building) once ran from the room.<ref>Bruegmann, p. 39</ref> Although the building was commissioned for the Chicago Board of Trade, its first tenant was the [[Quaker Oats Company]], which moved in on [[May 1]] [[1930]].<ref>Bruegmann, p. 35</ref>

Commissioned in 1930 but removed from the agricultural trading room in 1973 and stored until 1982, [[John W. Norton]]'s three-story [[mural]] of Ceres shown bare-breasted in a field of grain underwent extensive restoration in [[Spring Grove, Illinois|Spring Grove]], [[Illinois]] by Louis Pomerantz before being displayed in the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the 1980s addition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0407280227jul28,1,3550140.story?coll=chi-entertainment-utl=Visual Gems|title=A dozen visual gems you probably won't find listed in a travel guide|author=Artner, Alan G.|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=[[2004-07-28]]|accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic24-01-002.html|title=Treatment and Mounting of Ceres, a Large Mural Painting on Fabric by John Norton|author=Pomerantz, Louis|publisher=Jounal of the American Institute for Conservation|date=[[1984]]|accessdate = 2007-08-05}}</ref>

===Trading floor===
[[Image:Chicago bot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade.]]
According to the [[June 16]] [[1930]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', visitors carrying ripened wheat heads stared in curiosity at the six-story tall [[trading room]] directly above the lobby and behind the large windows below the clock facing LaSalle Street. At the center of the room, ''Time'' reported on the items being traded in "pits" organized based on commodities type with pits names such as the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised octagonal structures where [[open outcry]] trading occurs. Steps up the outside of each octagon provide an [[amphitheater]] atmosphere, and enable a large number of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] to see each other and communicate during trading hours.  With early versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878.<ref name=CBOTHistory/>

The trading area is surrounded by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell.  When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, [[morse code]] operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined the walls of the trading hall and the advent of [[electronic trading]] resulted in computers being placed on desktops.

Subsequent additions to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces in the additions to the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused for more than two years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete.  It was renovated in a modern style and now is leased to a privately owned [[option (finance)|options]] trading firm.<ref>{{cite news | title = CBOT Leases 1930 Trading Floor to PEAK6 | publisher = PEAK6 Investments, LP | date = [[2004-02-24]] | url = http://www.peak6.com/news3.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref>

===Expansion===
[[Image:CBOTlogo.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Chicago Board of Trade logo]]
In 1980, the owners added a {{convert|275|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} 23-story expansion to the south side of the building.<ref>Zaloom, p. 45</ref> It was topped by an octagonal ornament shaped similarly to the terraced trading pits and was designed in a [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern style]] by [[Helmut Jahn]].  Colored black and silver, with a sunlit atrium on the 12th floor facing the south wall of the older structure, the annex provided a four-story granite lined agricultural trading floor, then the world's largest at {{convert|32000|sqft|sqm|-1}}.<ref name=CBOTHistory/>  Even as the [[Sydney Futures Exchange]] and other markets were ceasing outcry trading, Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] led the [[groundbreaking]] on [[January 17]] [[1995]], for additional expansion into a five-story building to the east designed by architects Fujikawa Johnson and structural engineers TT-CBM. When opened in 1997, the $175&nbsp;million structure would add {{convert|60000|sqft|sqm|-1}} of trading space and for a period again would house the world's largest trading floor.<ref name=CBOTHistory/><ref name=FIM/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9502E4DC103FF934A25751C0A961958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fC%2fChicago%20Board%20of%20Trade|title=Face Lift at Board of Trade: High Tech, Say Hello to Primal Instinct |author=Feder, Barnaby J.|publisher=New York Times|date=[[1997-02-17]]|accessdate = 2007-08-04}}</ref> It was nicknamed the "Arboretum" by some in reference to expansion supporter CBOT Chairman Patrick H.

The addition has a twelve-story [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and melds historical and contemporary design with art deco references such as setbacks, central tower, symmetrical projecting wings, pyramidal roof and abstract cascade and scallop lobby design.<ref name=TSTL59-60>Saliga, Pauline A. (ed.), pp. 159&ndash;60.</ref> Between the original and new buildings, where there was formerly a street, a wide street-level walkway connects the plaza on LaSalle Street to Van Buren Street in what would ordinarily be the building's first floor. Passing over the Van Buren Street elevated tracks, a green glass-enclosed steel-frame bridge connects the lower southwest corner of the 23&nbsp;story addition to the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (although this bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] for security reasons).

===Renovation===
[[Image:CBOTmailbox.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Lobby mailbox at the Chicago Board of Trade.]]
In 2005, the building experienced an extensive $20 million renovation directed by Chicago architect Gunny Harboe, whose restoration work included Loop landmarks the [[Rookery Building]] and [[Reliance Building]].  The project included [[Refurbishment|restoration]] of the main lobby to emphasize the design features of the art deco era, elevator modernization, [[Facade|fa<U+00E7>ade]] renovation and cleaning, and the continued renovation of upper floor corridors and hallways.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kamin, Blair |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0608060179aug06,1,1649583.story?coll=chi-entertainment-utl |title=Deco Resurrection|publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=[[2006-08-06]]|accessdate = 2007-07-14}}</ref><ref name="cbot2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbot.com/cbot/building/cont_detail/0,3476,121+32635,00.html|title=North Building Renovations|date=2005|accessdate = 2007-07-14|publisher=Chicago Board of Trade}}</ref>  Though impractically small for modern use, mailboxes in the lobby were restored to their original condition to follow the theme of vertical lines found throughout the complex.<ref name=BuildingInsight/> An improved electrical infrastructure, with ten main feeds from seven different [[Commonwealth Edison]] [[electrical substation]]s, was added in addition to redundant cooling systems and upgraded telecommunications capabilities.<ref name="cbot2"/>

When the old CBOT building was demolished in 1929, two {{Weight|ton=4.5}} {{convert|12|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall gray [[granite]] statues of classically styled goddesses (pictured above) were moved from the second floor ledge above the main entrance into the gardens of the 500-acre (2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) estate of [[Arthur W. Cutten]], a wheat and cotton speculator who went bankrupt during the [[Great Depression]]. One goddess represents agriculture and is shown standing with wheat and leaning on a [[cornucopia]]. The other represents industry and appears with the [[Bow (ship)|bow of a ship]] and an anvil.

The statues were found in 1978 near [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois|Glen Ellyn]], Illinois by the [[Forest Preserve District of DuPage County]], on land acquired from Cutten's estate. After being displayed in a parking lot at Danada Forest Preserve for several years, both were returned to the CBOT building's plaza and rededicated on [[June 9]] [[2005]].<ref name=roeder /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org/Magazine/archives/arc_news/050404.htm|title=Chicago Statues May Come Home|publisher=Preservation Magazine|date=2004-05-4|accessdate = 2007-08-08}}</ref>

==Later history==
===Surroundings===
The LaSalle Street canyon is home to other historic buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark considered to be the oldest standing [[high-rise]]. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in the [[Prairie School]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/R/RookeryBuilding.html|title=Rookery Building|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref>   The name [[rookery]] comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons.  The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and [[One North LaSalle]] was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings.  Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places.  Since 1853, the [[Law and government of Chicago|governments of Chicago]] and Cook County have shared three different buildings at the north end of the canyon. The current [[Chicago City Hall]], built in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Classical Revival]] style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and vigor of the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/C/CityHall.html|title=City Hall|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|date=2003|accessdate = 2007-08-02}}</ref> Completed in 2001, an award winning [[green roof]] was incorporated into the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asla.org/meetings/awards/awds02/chicagocityhall.html|title=Chicago City Hall Green Roof

===Graphic arts===
Although depicted with the tower in a [[Rand McNally]] map from 1893, later [[lithograph]]s of the first 141 Jackson Street location display a red roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of [[panorama|panoramic]] scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades.  In views from the [[Museum Campus]], the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller [[Sears Tower]] in the background. Photographer [[Andreas Gursky]] has used the location for [[still life]] prints such as 1997's ''Chicago Board of Trade, I'' and 1999's ''Chicago Board of Trade, II''.  A photograph of the exterior, from the ''Museum'' series by [[Thomas Struth]], is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.
