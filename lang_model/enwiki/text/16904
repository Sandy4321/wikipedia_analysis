'''John R. Fellows''' (July 29, 1832 [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Rensselaer County, New York]] <U+2013> December 7, 1896 [[New York City]]) was an American lawyer and politician from [[Arkansas]] and [[New York]].

==Life==
He was the son of Tisdale Eddy Fellows (1800<U+2013>1874, farmer, later Superintendent of the [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]] Cemetery) and Eliza (Harris) Fellows (1809<U+2013>1867). Fellows removed with his parents to a farm in [[Stillwater (town), New York|Stillwater]]<ref>Sources give "in" or "near" [[Mechanicville, New York]], but this village was incorporated only in 1859, the area belonging to the Town of Stillwater at the time Fellows lived there. Stillwater was his father's birthplace, other family members are registered as having died at Mechanicville after the 1860s.</ref> in [[Saratoga County, New York]], and attended there the country schools. Among his playmates was [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]].

In 1850, Fellows went to [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden]], [[Ouachita County, Arkansas]], to live with his uncle. There he studied law, was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1855. At one time he practiced law in partnership with [[Walter L. Bragg]]. 

He ran for [[presidential elector]] on the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union]] ticket of [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|Bell]] and [[Edward Everett|Everett]] in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]], but [[Arkansas]] was carried by [[John C. Breckinridge]]. He was a delegate to the State [[Ordinance of Secession|secession convention]] in 1861. 

He enlisted in the [[1st Arkansas Infantry]] of the [[Confederate States Army]]. After the [[Battle of Shiloh]], he was made a [[colonel]] and assigned to staff duties as assistant adjutant to Gen. [[William Beall]]. Later he was [[Inspector general#United States|inspector general]] at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], and was captured there on July 9, 1863. He was kept a prisoner of war until the end of the [[American Civil War]], and released on June 10, 1865. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law in Camden. He was a member of the [[Arkansas Senate]] from 1866 to 1867. On July 4, 1867, he married Lizzie Reynolds, and they had six children.

He was a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]], held at the new [[Tammany Hall]] building in [[New York City]], and was noticed by Tammany boss [[William M. Tweed]] as an eloquent campaign speaker. Urged by Tweed, Fellows removed to New York City to continue the practice of law there and to campaign for the Tammany organization. 

Tweed secured Fellows's appointment in 1868 by Corporation Counsel Richard O'Gorman (1821<U+2013>1895) as Assistant C.C., and in 1869, D.A. [[Samuel B. Garvin]] appointed Fellows an Assistant [[New York County District Attorney]]. He remained in this office until the end of 1872 when Garvin's term expired and a Republican D.A. succeeded. After the fall of Tweed, Fellows left Tammany and joined the Anti-Tammany Democrats in New York City, at times known as the "Young Democracy", the "County Democracy" and "Irving Hall". 

Fellows was re-appointed Assistant D.A. in 1882 by D.A. [[John McKeon]], and remained on this post under [[John Vincent (lawyer)|John Vincent]], [[Wheeler H. Peckham]], [[Peter B. Olney]] and [[Randolph B. Martine]]. Fellows was elected on the Tammany and County Democracy tickets D.A. in November 1887, defeating his fellow Assistant D.A. [[De Lancey Nicoll]] who was a Democrat but ran on the Republican ticket. During the fiercely fought election campaign, two letters Fellows had written to Boss Tweed on February 1, 1873, asking for a loan of $523, were published in the ''[[New York Times]]'', with the comment that this was the payment for Fellows's service in having the jury disagree on a verdict against Tweed on the previous day, and that the "loan" was never paid back. Fellows was D.A. from 1888 to 1890, but did not run for re-election in November 1890, preferring to rejoin Tammany Hall and to run for Congress instead. Nicoll was then elected on the Tammany ticket to succeed as D.A.

Fellows was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[52nd United States Congress|52nd]] and [[53rd United States Congress]]es, serving from March 4, 1891, until his resignation, effective December 31, 1893.

He was again elected on the Tammany ticket New York County D.A., and took office on January 1, 1894. He had been a delegate to all Democratic National Conventions from 1868 on. He also was a delegate to the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] but repudiated [[William Jennings Bryan]], the Democratic candidate nominated on a [[Free Silver]] platform and joined the "Gold Democrats". In September 1896, he was a delegate to the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic]] Convention in [[Indianapolis]] which nominated the [[John M. Palmer (politician)|Palmer]] - [[Simon Bolivar Buckner|Buckner]] ticket for the [[United States presidential election, 1896]]. 

Fellows died from [[stomach cancer]] at his home at 610, West 152nd Street, and was buried at the [[Trinity Church Cemetery]].
