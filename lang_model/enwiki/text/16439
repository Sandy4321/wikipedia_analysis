After the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|1918 Armistice]], Boylston remained in Europe working for the [[Red Cross]] for two years providing services to civilians in [[Albania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]].<ref name =silvey>{{cite book | last =Silvey  | first =Anita | title = Children's Books and Their Creators | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year =1995 | location =

During periods in the United States, Boylston worked as the head of an outpatient department and as an instructor in anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, as well a psychiatric nurse in [[New York City]] and a head nurse in a [[Connecticut]] hospital, experiences she was to mine in future books.<ref name="ellie"/><ref name="sueb"/> Between 1921 and 1924 she worked again with the Red Cross in Europe,<ref name="ellie"/><ref name="sueb"/> and in 1925 wrote a reminiscence of her student nursing days that was published in the American Journal of Nursing.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boylston |first=Helen Dore |title=Christmas reveries |journal=American Journal of Nursing |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=pp. 997<U+2013>998 |month=December |year=1925|doi=10.2307/3409629 |jstor=3409629 |publisher=The American Journal of Nursing, Vol. 25, No. 12 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Boylston was still anxious for adventure and wrote to a friend "Daddy wants me to settle down, but I'm young! I'm young! Why shouldn't I live? What is old age if it has no memories except of 40 years or so of blank days?"<ref name =falcon/> In 1926 Lane and Boylston traveled to Europe with the goal of moving to [[Albania]] and earn their living by writing.<ref name =falcon/>  In preparation, between March and September 1926 they lived in [[Paris]], studying French, Italian, German and Russian at the [[Berlitz International|Berlitz School]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Holtz|1995|pp=161<U+2013>3}}</ref>  In August they purchased a maroon Model T Ford which they named "Zenobia" in honor of the [[Bedouin]] queen of ancient times, and set off to Albania with their French maid, Yvonne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holtz|1995|pp=163, 166}}</ref>  An account of the journey, called ''Travels With Zenobia: Paris to Albania by [[Ford Model T|Model T Ford]]'' was published in 1983.<ref name="NYT"/><ref name="ellie"/>

Boylston lived in a comfortable house in [[Tirana, Albania]] for two years.  The house she shared with Lane was the scene of numerous parties, where members of the Albanian government danced to the sound of their imported [[Victrola]].  According to her publisher Boylston "once made the Albanian Prime Minister carry her trunk off the boat and tried to tip him, not knowing who he was."<ref name="andme"/> She was also "shot at for two hours in a ditch in southern Albania, owing to a mistake in identity".<ref name="andme"/> While in Albania, Boylston assisted at an Albanian school of nursing that was directed by a fellow graduate from the School of Nursing at Massachusetts General Hospital.<ref name="nurse"/> After about two years,  Boylston saw a picture of a [[baked potato]] in a magazine, and feeling an "irresistible lure", returned to the US.<ref name="andme"/>  A less dramatic version has her deciding to accompany Lane home after Lane had received a disturbing cablegram from her parents in January 1928.<ref name="Holtz 1995 184">{{Harvnb|Holtz|1995|p=184}}</ref> 

In the summer of 1928 Boylston arrived at Rocky Ridge, the Wilder family farmhouse in Mansfield, [[Missouri]].<ref name="Holtz 1995 184"/><ref name="fellman">{{cite book|last= Fellman|first= Anita Clair|title=Little House, Long Shadow : Laura Ingalls Wilder's Impact on American Culture  |publisher=University of Missouri Press |page= 40| year=2008|isbn=978-0-8262-1803-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WC0ZMqoaiYsC&pg=PA40}}</ref>  Encouraged by the publication of her War Diary in book form, she decided to gain a living by writing, though she also supported in part by inherited income. She initially lived in a tent on a hill near the farmhouse, though the plan was that Boylston and Lane would live in the remodeled and modernized farmhouse, while Lane's parents, Laura Ingalls Wilder and Almanzo Wilder, moved into a newly-built English stone cottage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holtz|1995|pp=187, 194}}</ref>  

Boylston lost considerable sums of investment income in the Depression and in the early 1930s moved east to work again as a nurse.<ref name="fellman">{{cite book|last= Fellman|first= Anita Clair|title=Little House, Long Shadow : Laura Ingalls Wilder's Impact on American Culture  |publisher=University of Missouri Press |page= 42| year=2008|isbn=978-0-8262-1803-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WC0ZMqoaiYsC&pg=PA42}}</ref>
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Boylston began writing and publishing stories more seriously. She published articles and stories in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', and ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', and wrote a radio script for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]].<ref name="silvey"/><ref name="nurse"/> 
In 1936 Boylston published ''Sue Barton: Student Nurse'', the first of her seven Sue Barton books.<ref name="NYT"/> The books followed the career of a red-haired nurse as she progressed through her training, career, marriage and motherhood, and sought to maintain her independence.<ref name="ellie"/> They were significant in providing role models to girls who wanted careers from the 1930s to 1950s, and in being among those that defined the young adult category of literature.<ref name="silvey"/>  The books were highly successful, selling millions of copies in English and translations,<ref name="NYT"/> and were praised for their authentic representation of nursing practice and freedom from sentimentality.<ref name="silvey"/> The books have remained in print ever since.<ref name="sueb"/> 

With Sue Barton married to Bill Barry and expecting her first baby in ''Sue Barton: Superintendent Nurse'', Boylston began a new series about another career woman, this time an actress, Carol Page.  She incorporated the advice and experience of [[Eva Le Gallienne]], her friend and neighbor,<ref name="ellie"/><ref name="andme"/> as well as researching her stories backstage at La Gallienne's [[Civic Repertory Theatre]] in New York City.<ref name="silvey"/>  Boylston later returned to Sue Barton, publishing the final two books in the series ''Sue Barton: Neighborhood Nurse'' and ''Sue Barton: Staff Nurse'' in 1949 and 1952 respectively.<ref name="andme"/> In 1955, Boylston published ''Clara Barton: Founder of the American Red Cross'', a biography for young adults of Civil War nurse [[Clara Barton]].<ref name="silvey"/>

Boylston never married.<ref name="NYT"/> She suffered from dementia in later years,<ref>{{Harvnb|Holtz|1995|p=8}}</ref> and died in [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]], [[Connecticut]] at the age of 89, leaving no known relatives.<ref name="NYT"/>
