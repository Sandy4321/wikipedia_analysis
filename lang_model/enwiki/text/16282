With a [[customer base]] of over 11.5 million in the [[United States]], the company is the third largest [[Fortune 500]] company in the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]], with a market cap of over $10 billion dollars and $21.4 billion in revenue. Humana employs over 22,500 "associates" nationwide. Humana markets its health benefit consumer services in all 50 states, [[D.C.]], [[Puerto Rico]] and has [[international business]] interests in [[Western Europe]]. In its March 2007 issue, [[Fortune Magazine]] named Humana one of the Top 5 Most Admired Healthcare Companies in the United States.

==History==

The company was founded by David Jones and Wendell Cherry as a [[nursing home]] company in 1961. Then known as Extendicare, the company became the largest nursing home company in the United States. Extendicare later divested the nursing home chain and moved into purchasing [[hospitals]] in 1972, becoming the world's largest hospital company in the 1980s. 

To reflect the company's new direction, the corporate name was changed to Humana Inc. in 1974.
Humana experienced tremendous growth in the years that followed, both organically and through the takeover of American Medicorp Inc. in 1978, which doubled the company's size. During the mid-1970s, the company used a [[fast-track]] construction process to complete and open one hospital a month. This accelerated construction schedule, which compressed time by overlapping processes, allowed Humana to develop hospital projects faster than the industry norm. During that construction boom, Humana developed the double corridor model for hospital construction. This highly efficient design minimized the distance between patients and nurses by placing nursing support services in the interior of the building with patient rooms surrounding the perimeter.

As the American health care system evolved in the 1980s, Humana developed an integrated health care delivery system by creating a family of flexible health care plans. In 1984, Humana began marketing [[health insurance]].   

Humana brought the pioneering [[artificial heart]] research of Dr. [[Robert Jarvik]] and Dr. [[William DeVries]] to Louisville, creating the Humana Heart Institute in 1985.

The 1990s marked Humana's metamorphis into a consumer health benefits company. Humana spun-off its hospital operations from the health insurance operations in 1993. The new company was called Galen Health Care Inc. Soon after, Galen merged with Columbia/[[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]]. United Healthcare attempted to acquire Humana in the Spring of 1998. United's effort failed when it reported an almost billion dollar quarterly loss. Humana began pioneering work in [[consumer driven health care]] in 1999; launching its first services on September 11, 2001.

In 2001, Humana partnered with Navigy, Inc., a subsidiary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., to launch Availity to empower physicians and other health care professionals with a business solution to conduct their daily health plan transactions.

Humana began marketing [[health savings account]] services to individuals and companies in 2003 and entered into a business partnership with [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] in 2005. The Business Health Care Group of Southeast Wisconsin (BHCGSW) chose Humana as its administrative partner to drive Southeastern [[Wisconsin]] health care costs to the [[Midwest]] average in 2005, using a strategy that includes consumer education, providing cost and quality information on health care providers, structuring accountability of all stakeholders and collective purchasing. Today, the BHCGSW represents more than 200 member companies, including large and small employers representing more than 150,000 health care consumers in Southeastern Wisconsin.  

Upon passage of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] in the [[U. S. Congress]], Humana aggressively launched an education campaign to  market [[Medicare (United States)#Part C: Medicare Advantage plans|Medicare Advantage]] (MA) and [[Medicare Part D|Prescription Drug Plans]] (PDP) nationwide to Medicare eligible consumers in 2006. A cross country [[RV]] tour and [[strategic alliance]] with [[State Farm]] and [[Wal-Mart]], the campaign signed up approximately 5 million consumers and catapulted Humana to #2 in industry market share for senior products. Humana also launched a national [[mail-order]] retail [[pharmacy]] business in 2006.

==Location==
[[Image:Humana.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Humana headquarters at the [[Humana Building]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]]]

The [[Humana Building]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] is a well-known example of [[postmodern architecture]]; it was designed by [[Michael Graves]] and completed in 1985. Humana sponsored an architectural competition to determine the design of its headquarters building. Scale models of the participants (including the submissions of [[Helmut Jahn]], [[IM Pei]], Michael Graves and others) are contained in a vestibule located directly above the Main Street entrance of the Humana Building.

In addition to its corporate headquarters building in Louisville at 5th and [[Main Street]], Humana owns and occupies the Waterside Building at 1st and Main, and the Riverview Square at 2nd and Main.  Humana recently announced its plan to lease space in the Waterfront Plaza East Tower in the 300 block of Main Street. The company also leases space in three other downtown buildings<U+2014>National City in the 400 block of Main Street, the 515 Building on Market Street, and the ISB Building on Magazine Street. By mid-2006, Humana expects to employ approximately 6,900 associates in Louisville.

Humana recently undertook the [[historic preservation]] of a city block of several [[19th Century]] buildings located beside its [[headquarters]] building.

Humana has purchased, or entered into agreements to purchase, all but two of the buildings on the south side of West Main Street between 5th and 6th streets<U+2014>buildings in the same block, and adjacent to, the Humana Building. The three businesses that currently operate in those buildings will remain.   

The company is working with preservation experts to ensure that the historic integrity of the block is maintained.
