The Harman seats 775, an increase over the Lansburgh<U+2019>s 451. The stage was designed to be flexible with multiple staging configurations possible since the performance space will be made available to other arts groups besides the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]]. The walls of the theater are panels of makore, an African wood, and behind the panels are retractable velour curtains, which can be raised to alter the acoustics of the room.
The first several rows of seats are on movable wagons that can be either set parallel to the stage or rotated to form a thrust stage.<ref>P. Marks, "A Bold New Stage for D.C.", ''Washington Post'', p.R1 9 September 2007</ref>

The theatre is named for [[Sidney Harman, Ph.D.|Dr. Sidney Harman]], a philanthropist and [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] Trustee.
