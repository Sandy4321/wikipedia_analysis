'''Llactapata''' (also spelled '''Llaqtapata''') is a combination of two [[Quechua language|Quechua]] words. The pronunciation of Llaqtapata is yakta-pahta.<ref>Explore the Inca Trail. Rucksack Readers. 2006. page 61.</ref>

[[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]], discoverer of Machu Picchu and many other Incan sites, states that Llacta Pata is a descriptive term; "llacta" means "town" and "pata" means "a height".<ref>Lost City of the Incas. by Hiram Bingham. 1952. The Orion Publishing Group Ltd, Orion House. page 164. ISBN 0 297 60759 6</ref><ref name=incaland/> Thus, more than one site has been, and is, referred to by this name.

==Sites associated with the name Llactapata==
In the vicinity of Machu Picchu there appear to be two locations commonly referred to as Llactapata: one is a site about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west of Machu Picchu; while the other is a site some {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south east of Machu Picchu. Both sites appear to be commonly known as Llactapata; both sites have Incan ruins; both sites are on different stretches of a trail known as the Inca trail.

A third site is also mentioned.

===Llactapata west===
The Llactapata to the west of Machu Picchu (at: {{coord|-13.1756028|-72.5859833|scale:20000|format=dms|display=inline}}) appears to be the site originally reported by Bingham as having this name. Although the site was little explored by Bingham, it was more extensively explored and mapped by the Thomson and Ziegler expedition of 2003.

[[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] first discovered Llactapata in 1912. "We found evidence that some Inca chieftain had built his home here and had included in the plan ten or a dozen buildings."<ref>Lost City of the Incas. by Hiram Bingham. 1952. The Orion Publishing Group Ltd, Orion House. page 164. ISBN 0 297 60759 6</ref> 
Bingham locates the site "on top of a ridge between the valleys of the Aobamba and the Salcantay, about 5,000 feet above the estate of Huaquina." "Here we discovered a number of ruins and two or three modern huts. The Indians said that the place was called Llacta Pata." <ref>Lost City of the Incas. by Hiram Bingham. 1952. The Orion Publishing Group Ltd, Orion House. page 164. ISBN 0 297 60759 6</ref>
Bingham did not investigate the ruins thoroughly, however, and they were not studied again for another 70 years.

A mid-2003 study of the site conducted by Thomson and Ziegler<ref>

}}</ref> concluded that Llactapata's location along the Inca trail suggested that it was an important rest stop and roadside shrine on the journey to Machu Picchu. The complex is located some four to five kilometers west of Machu Picchu high on a ridge between the Aobamba and Santa Teresa drainages. This and subsequent investigations have revealed an extensive complex of structures and features related to and connected with Machu Picchu by a continuation of the Inca Trail leading onward into the Vilcabamba. Llactapata may have been a member of the network of interrelated administrative and ceremonial sites which supported the regional center at Machu Picchu.  It probably played an important astronomical function during the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.<ref>{{cite journal | first = J.

Although the Llactapata to the east of Machu Picchu (at: {{coord|-13.2325095|-72.424922|scale:5000|format=dms|display=inline}}) is not the site referred to by Bingham as Llactapata it does appear to have acquired the common use name of Llactapata, as evidenced by the photograph of a sign from a check point along the Inca trail.

In addition to the site referred to in the section on Llactapata west, Bingham located another site "at Qquente, and near the mouth of the Pampaccahuana river, on top of a series of terraces"<ref name=incaland>

Patallacta and Llactapata east appear to be the same place.

This site housed a large number of occupants, including travellers and soldiers who manned the nearby "hill fort" of Willkaraqay. A shrine with rounded walls, known as Pulpituyoc, had religious and ceremonial functions.<ref>Explore the Inca Trail. Rucksack Readers. 2006.</ref>

Llactapata was burned by [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], who destroyed a number of settlements along the [[Inca road system|Inca trail]] during his retreat from [[Cusco]] in 1536 to discourage Spanish pursuit.  In part due to these efforts, the Spanish never discovered the Inca trail or any of its settlements.<ref>{{cite book | last = Noland | first = David | title = Trekking | publisher = W. W.
