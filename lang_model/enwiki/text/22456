A '''subsidy''' is a form of financial or in kind support extended to an economic sector (or [[institution]], business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting beneficial economic and social outcomes.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001">{{cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-55963-835-4|coauthors=Kent, J.}}</ref> Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or implicit subsidies. Subsidies have a long track record and today come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans), indirect ([[tax break]]s, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates).<ref name="Collins Dictionary">{{cite web|title=Collins Dictionary of Economics|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/subsidy?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=05/09/2013}}</ref> Furthermore, they can be broad or narrow, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical. The most common forms of subsidies are those to the producer or the consumer. Producer/Production subsidies ensure producers are better off by either supplying market price support, direct support, or payments to factors of production.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /> Consumer/Consumption subsidies commonly reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer, for example in the US at one time it was cheaper to buy petrol than bottled water.<ref name="Myers 1998a">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Lifting the veil on perverse subsidies|journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6674|pages=327<U+2013>328|doi=10.1038/32761|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6674/abs/392327a0.html}}</ref>

Subsidies can be hugely damaging or beneficial because they create distortions. They are designed to overcome deficiencies in the [[market]], support disadvantaged parts of society, and positively distort activities such as pushes towards [[renewable energy]], [[recycling]]  and [[Set-aside|agricultural set-asides]]. Simply put they represent an attempt by Governments to control the behaviour of individuals, businesses and larger groups by offering or exacting economic benefits/taxes. Other benefits may spin off, primarily as subsidies may act as a form of [[protectionism]] or [[trade barrier]] to foreign imports thus protecting domestic goods and services.

== Types of subsidies ==

=== Production subsidy ===
A production subsidy encourages suppliers to increase the output of a particular product by partially offsetting the production costs or losses.<ref name="Collins Dictionary" /> The objective of production subsidies is to expand production of a particular product more so than the market would promote but without rising the final price to consumers. This type of subsidy is predominantly found in developed markets.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /> Other examples of production subsidies include the assistance in the creation of a new firm ([[Enterprise Investment Scheme]]), industry ([[Industrial policy|Industrial Policy]]) and even the development of certain areas ([[Regional policy|Regional Policy]]). Production subsidies are critically discussed in the literature as they can cause many problems including the additional cost of storing the extra produced products, depressing world market prices, and incentivising producers to over-produce - for example a farmer over-producing in terms of his land<U+2019>s carrying capacity.

===Consumer/consumption subsidy===
A consumption subsidy is one that subsidises the behaviour of consumers. These type of subsidies are most common in [[developing countries]] where Governments subsidise such things as food, water, electricity and education on the basis that no matter how impoverished, all should be allowed those most basic requirements.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /> For example, some Governments offer <U+2018>lifetime<U+2019> rates for electricity, that is, the first increment of electricity each month is subsidised.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" />

=== Export subsidy ===
An export subsidy is a support from the government for products that are exported, as a means of assisting the country<U+2019>s balance of payments.<ref name="Collins Dictionary" /> [[Usha Haley]] and [[George Haley]] identified the subsidies to manufacturing industry provided by the Chinese Government and how they have altered trade patterns.<ref name="Haley and Haley 2013">{{cite book|last=Haley|first=U.|title=Subsidies to Chinese Industry|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|url=http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576680-new-book-lays-out-scale-chinas-industrial-subsidies-perverse-advantage|coauthors=G. Haley}}</ref> Traditionally, economists have argued that subsidies benefit consumers but hurt the subsidizing countries.  Haley and Haley provided data to show that over the decade after China joined the [[World Trade Organization]] industrial subsidies have helped give China an advantage in industries in which they previously enjoyed no comparative advantage such as the steel, glass, paper, auto parts, and solar industries.<ref name="Haley and Haley 2013">{{cite book|last=Haley|first=U.|title=Subsidies to Chinese Industry|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|url=http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576680-new-book-lays-out-scale-chinas-industrial-subsidies-perverse-advantage|coauthors=G. Haley}}</ref>

=== Employment subsidy ===
An employment subsidy serves as an incentive to businesses to provide more job opportunities to reduce the level of unemployment in the country (income subsidies) or to encourage research and development.<ref name="Collins Dictionary" /> With an employment subsidy, the government provides assistance with wages. Another form of employment subsidy is the social security benefits. Employment subsidies allow a person receiving the benefit to enjoy some minimum standard of living.

===Tax subsidy===
Government can create exactly the same outcome through selective tax breaks as through cash payment.  For example, suppose a government sends monetary assistance that reimburses 15% of all health expenditures to a group that is paying 15% income tax.  Exactly the same subsidy is achieved by giving a health tax deduction.  Tax subsidies are also known as [[tax expenditures]].  Tax subsidies are one of the main explanations for why the tax code is so complicated.<ref name="Gale and Harris 2007">{{cite web|last=Gale|first=V.|title=Tax Simplification:Why are taxes so complicated?|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/improve/simplification/why.cfm|publisher=Tax Policy Centre: Urban Institute and Brookings Institution|coauthors=Harris, B.|year=2007}}</ref>

===Environmental externalities===
As well as the conventional and formal subsidies as outlined above there are myriad implicit subsidies principally in the form of environmental [[Externality|externalities]].<ref name="Myers 1998a" /> These subsidies include anything that is emitted but not accounted for and thus is an externality. These include things such as car drivers who pollute everyone<U+2019>s atmosphere without compensating everyone, farmers who use [[pesticides]] which can pollute everyone<U+2019>s ecosystems again without compensating everyone or Britain<U+2019>s electricity production which results in additional [[acid rain]] in Scandinavia.<ref name="Myers 1998a" /><ref name="Myers 2008">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse Priorities|journal=IUCN Opinion Piece|year=2008|pages=6<U+2013>7|url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/00_w_c_2008_02_perverse.pdf}}</ref> In these examples the polluter is effectively gaining a net benefit but not compensating those affected. Although they are not subsidies in the form of direct economic support from the Government, they are no less economically, socially and environmentally harmful.

==Categorising subsidies ==

===Broad and narrow===
These various subsidies can be divided into <U+2018>broad<U+2019> and <U+2018>narrow<U+2019>. Narrow subsidies are those monetary transfers that are easily identifiable and have a clear intent. They are commonly characterised by a monetary transfer between Governments and institutions or businesses and individuals. A classic example is a Government payment to a farmer.<ref name="Myers 2008" />

Conversely broad subsidies include both monetary and non-monetary subsidies and is often difficult to identify.<ref name="Myers 2008" /> A broad subsidy is less attributable and less transparent. Environmental externalities are the most common type of broad subsidy.

== Economic effects ==
[[File:Subsidy- visualization.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0]]

Competitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. When the quantity demanded exceeds the equilibrium quantity, price falls; conversely, a reduction in the supply of a good beyond equilibrium quantity implies an increase in the price.<ref name="Ameg">Amegashie, J. A. (2006). The Economics of Subsidies. Crossroads , 6 (2), 7-15.</ref> The effect of a subsidy is to shift the supply or demand curve to the right (i.e. increases the supply or demand) by the amount of the subsidy. If a consumer is receiving the subsidy, a lower price of a good resulting from the marginal subsidy on consumption increases demand, shifting the demand curve to the right. If a supplier is receiving the subsidy, an increase in the price (revenue) resulting from the marginal subsidy on production results increases supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.

[[File:Subsidy - visualization 2.tiff|thumb|upright=2.0]]

Assuming the market is in a perfectly competitive equilibrium, a subsidy increases the supply of the good beyond the equilibrium competitive quantity. The imbalance creates deadweight loss. Deadweight loss from a subsidy is the amount by which the cost of the subsidy exceeds the gains of the subsidy.<ref name=watkins>{{cite journal|last=Watkins|first=T.|title=The Impact of an Excise Tax or Subsidy on Price|journal=San Jos<U+00E9> State University Department of Economics|year=(n.d.)|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/taximpact.htm|accessdate=01/04/2013}}</ref> The magnitude of the deadweight loss is dependent on the size of the subsidy. This is considered a market failure, or inefficiency.<ref name="watkins">Watkins, T. (n.d.). The Impact of an Excise Tax or Subsidy on Price. Retrieved April 1, 2013, from San Jos<U+00E9> State University Department of Economics.{{url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/taximpact.htm}}</ref>

Subsidies, by lowering the price of a good, make national goods more competitive against foreign goods, thereby reducing foreign competition.<ref name="Kolb 2008">{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=R.W.|title=Encyclopedia of business ethics and society|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412916523|chapter=Subsidies}}</ref> As a result, many developing countries cannot engage in foreign trade and receive lower prices for their products in the global market. This is considered protectionism: a government policy to erect trade barriers in order to protect domestic industries.<ref>Protectionism. (2006). Collins Dictionary</ref> The problem with protectionism arises when industries are selected for nationalistic reasons (Infant-Industry), rather than to gain a comparative advantage. The market distortion, and reduction in social welfare, is the logic behind the World Bank policy for the removal of subsidies in developing countries.<ref name="Ameg"/>

Subsidies create spillover effects in other economic sectors and industries. A subsidized product sold in the world market lowers the price of the good in other countries. Since subsidies result in lower revenues for producers of foreign countries, they are a source of tension between the United States, Europe and poorer developing countries.<ref name="Parkin et al. 2007">{{cite book|last=Parkin|first=M.|title=Economics|year=2007|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Harlow|isbn=0132041227|edition=7th ed.|coauthors=Powell, M. and Matthews, K.}}</ref> While subsidies may provide immediate benefits to an industry, in the long-run they may prove to have unethical, negative effects. Subsidies are intended to support public interest, however, they can violate ethical or legal principles if they lead to higher consumer prices or discriminate against some producers to benefit others.<ref name="Kolb 2008"/> For example, domestic subsidies granted by individual US states may be unconstitutional if they discriminate against out-of-state producers, violating the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.<ref name="Kolb 2008"/> Depending on their nature, subsidies are discouraged by international trade agreements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).

==Perverse subsidies==

===Definition===
Although subsidies can be important many are <U+2018>perverse<U+2019>. To be <U+2018>perverse<U+2019>, subsidies must exert effects that are demonstrably and significantly adverse both economically and environmentally.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /> A subsidy rarely, if ever, starts perverse, but over time an legitimate efficacious subsidy can become perverse or illegitimate if it is not withdrawn after meeting its goal or as political goals change. Perverse subsidies are now so widespread that as of 2007 they amounted $2 trillion per year in the six most subsidised sectors alone (agriculture, fossil fuels, road transportation, water, fisheries and forestry).<ref name="Myers 2007">{{cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=An introduction to ecological economics|year=1997|publisher=St. Lucie Press|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=1884015727|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155197/|editor=Costanza, R., Norgaard, R., Daly, H., Goodland, R., and Cumberland, J.|accessdate=03/08/2013|chapter=Perverse subsidies}}</ref>

===The effects===
The detrimental effects of perverse subsidies are diverse in nature and reach. Case-studies from differing sectors are highlighted below but can be summarised as follows. Directly, they are expensive to Governments directing resources away from other legitimate priorities (biodiversity and conservation is commonly discussed).<ref name="Myers 2008" /><ref name="James 1999">{{cite journal|last=James|first=A.N.|coauthors=Gaston, K.J., and Balmford, A.|title=Balancing the Earth's accounts|journal=Nature|year=1999|volume=401|issue=6751|pages=323<U+2013>324|doi=10.1038/43774|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6751/full/401323a0.html}}</ref><ref name="Robin et al 2003">{{cite book|last=Robin|first=S.|title=Perverse Subsidies and the Implications for Biodiversity: A review of recent findings and the status of policy reforms|year=2003|publisher=Vth World Parks Congress: Sustainable Finance Stream.|location=Durban, South Africa|url=http://conservationfinance.org/guide/WPC/WPC_documents/Overview_PanB_Wolcott_v2.pdf|coauthors=Wolcott, R., and Quintela, C.E.}}</ref> Indirectly, they: cause [[environmental degradation]] - exploitation of resources, pollution, loss of landscape, misuse and overuse of supplies - which, as well as its fundamental damage, acts as a further brake on economies; tend to benefit the few at the expense of the many, and the rich at the expense of the poor; lead to further polarization of development between the Northern and Southern hemispheres; lower global market prices; and undermine investment decisions reducing the pressure on businesses to become more efficient.<ref name="Myers 1998a" /><ref name="Robin et al 2003" /><ref name="van beer and van den bergh 2009">{{cite journal|last=van Beers|first=C.|coauthors=van den Bergh, J.C.J.M.|title=Environmental Harm of Hidden Subsidies: Global Warming and Acidification|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|year=2009|volume=38|issue=6|pages=339<U+2013>341|doi=10.1579/08-A-616.1|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1579/08-A-616.1%20?journalCode=ambi}}</ref> Over time the latter effect means support becomes enshrined in human behaviour and business decisions to the point where people become reliant on, even addicted to, subsidies, <U+2018>locking<U+2019> them into society.<ref name="van beers and de moor 1998">{{cite journal|last=van Beers|first=C.|coauthors=de Moor, A.|title=Perverse subsidies, international trade and the environment|journal=Planejamento e Pol<U+00ED>ticas P<U+00FA>blicas|year=1998|volume=18|pages=49<U+2013>69|url=http://www.en.ipea.gov.br/ppp/index.php/PPP/article/viewFile/98/101}}</ref> Consumer attitudes do not change and become out of date, off target and inefficient,<ref name="Myers 1998a" /> and furthermore, over time people feel a sense of historical right to them<ref name="van beer and van den bergh 2009" /> Despite Governments being responsible for the creation and (lack of) termination of subsidies, it is ironic that perverse subsidies are not tackled more rigorously, particularly as the above highlight their contradiction to the majority of Governments<U+2019> stated policies.<ref name="Myers 1998a" />

===Implementation===
Perverse subsidies are not tackled as robustly as they should. Principally this because they become <U+2018>locked<U+2019> into society, causing bureaucratic roadblocks and institutional inertia.<ref name="Myers 1996">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse Subsidies|journal=Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity|year=1996|pages=268<U+2013>278|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/case-studies/inc/cs-inc-iucn-05-en.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Myers 1998b">{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Consumption and sustainable development: the role of perverse subsidies|journal=Background paper for the 1998 Human Development Report|year=1998|pages=1<U+2013>31|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr1998/papers/MYERS-Norman_Subsidies.pdf}}</ref> When cuts are suggested many argue (most fervently by those <U+2018>entitled<U+2019>, special interest groups and [[Lobbying|political lobbyists]]) that it will disrupt and harm the lives of people who receive them, distort domestic [[competitiveness]] curbing trade opportunities, and increase unemployment.<ref name="van beer and van den bergh 2009" /><ref name="Bellman et al 2012">{{cite journal|last=Bellmann|first=C.|coauthors=Hepburn, J., Sugathan, M., and Monkelbaan, J.|title=Tackling Perverse Subsidies in Agriculture, Fisheries and Energy|journal=International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development:  Information Note June 2012.|year=2012|url=http://ictsd.org/downloads/2012/06/tackling-perverse-subsidies-in-agriculture-fisheries-and-energy.pdf}}</ref> Individual governments recognise this as a <U+2018>[[prisoner<U+2019>s dilemma]]<U+2019> - inasmuch that even if they wanted to adopt subsidy reform, by acting unilaterally they fear only negative effects will ensue if others do not follow.<ref name="van beers and de moor 1998" /> Furthermore, cutting subsidies, however perverse they may be, is considered a vote-losing policy.<ref name="Myers 1996" />

Reform of perverse subsidies is at a propitious time. The current economic conditions mean governments are forced into fiscal constraints and are looking for ways to reduce activist roles in their economies.<ref name="Myers 1998b" /> There are two main reform paths: unilateral and multilateral. Unilateral agreements (one country) are less likely to be undertaken for the reasons outlined above although New Zealand,<ref name="Myers and Kent 2001 box 3.2">{{cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy|year=2001|pages=box 3.2|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-55963-835-4|coauthors=Kent, J.}}</ref> Russia, Bangladesh and others represent successful examples.<ref name="Myers 1998a" /> Multilateral actions by several countries are more likely to succeed as this reduces competitiveness concerns, but are more complex to implement requiring greater international collaboration through a body such as the [[WTO]].<ref name="Robin et al 2003" /> Irrespective of the path the aim of policymakers should be to: create alternative policies that target the same issue as the original subsidies but better; develop subsidy removal strategies allowing market-discipline to return; introduce <U+2018>sunset<U+2019> provisions that require remaining subsidies to be re-justified periodically; and make perverse subsidies more transparent to taxpayers to alleviate the <U+2018>vote-loser<U+2019> concern.<ref name="Myers 1998a" />

===Examples===

====Agricultural subsidies====
Support for agriculture dates back to the 19th century. It was developed extensively in the EU and USA across the two World Wars and the Great Depression to protect domestic food production, but remains important across the world today.<ref name="Robin et al 2003" /><ref name="Myers 1996" /> In 2005, US farmers received $14 billion and EU farmers $47 billion in agricultural subsidies.<ref name="Kolb 2008">{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=R.W.|title=Encyclopedia of business ethics and society|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=9781412916523|chapter=Subsidies}}</ref> Today, agricultural subsidies are defended on the grounds of helping farmers to maintain their livelihoods. While this is a noble aim, the majority of payments are based on outputs and inputs and thus favour the larger producing agribusinesses over the small-scale farmers.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /><ref name="Steenblik 1998">{{cite web|last=Steenblik|first=R.|title=Previous Multilateral Efforts to Discipline Subsidies to Natural Resource Based Industries|url=http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/fisheries/1918086.pdf|work=Workshop on the Impact of Government Financial Transfers on Fisheries Management, Resource Sustainability, and International Trade|accessdate=05/08/2013|year=1998}}</ref> In the USA nearly 30% of payments go to the top 2% of farmers.<ref name="Robin et al 2003" />

By subsidising inputs and outputs through such schemes as <U+2018>yield based subsidisation<U+2019>, farmers are encouraged to: over-produce using intensive methods including using more fertilizers and pesticides; grow high-yielding [[monocultures]]; reduce [[crop rotation]]; shorten fallow periods; and promote exploitative land use change from forests, rainforests and wetlands to agricultural land.<ref name="Robin et al 2003" /> These all lead to severe environmental degradation including adverse effects on: soil quality and productivity including [[erosion]], nutrient supply and salinity which in turn affects carbon storage and cycling, water retention and drought resistance; water quality including pollution, nutrient deposition and [[eutrophication]] of waterways, and lowering of water tables; diversity of flora and fauna including indigenous species both directly and indirectly through the destruction of habitats, resulting in a genetic wipe-out.<ref name="cheapMyers and Kent 2001" /><ref name="Robin et al 2003" /><ref name="Portugal 2002">{{cite journal|last=Portugal|first=L.|title=OECD Work on Defining and Measuring Subsidies in Agriculture|journal=The OECD Workshop on Environmentally Harmful Subsidies, Paris, 7<U+2013>8 November 2002|year=2002}}</ref><ref name="OECD 2003">{{cite web|last=OECD|title=Perverse incentives in biodiversity loss|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/resources/19819811.pdf|work=Working Party on Global and Structural Policies Working Group on Economic Aspects of Biodiversity|accessdate=05/08/2013|year=2003}}</ref>

Cotton growers in the US reportedly receive half their income from the government under the Farm Bill of 2002. The subsidy payments stimulated overproduction and resulted in a record cotton harvest in 2002, much of which had to be sold at very reduced prices in the global market.<ref name="Kolb 2008" /> For foreign producers, the depressed cotton price lowered their prices far below the break-even price. In fact, African farmers received 35 to 40 cents per pound for cotton, while US cotton growers, backed by government agricultural payments, received 75 cents per pound. Developing countries and trade organizations argue that poorer countries should be able to export their principal commodities to survive, but protectionist laws and payments in the United States and Europe prevent these countries from engaging in international trade opportunities.

====Fisheries====
Today, much of the world<U+2019>s major fisheries are overexploited - in 2002 the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] estimate this at approximately 75%. Fishing subsidies include: <U+201C>direct assistant to fishers; loan support programs; tax preferences and insurance support; capital and infrastructure programs; marketing and price support programs; and fisheries management, research, and conservation programs<U+201D>.<ref name="Robin et al 2003 p4">{{cite book|last=Robin|first=S.|title=Perverse Subsidies and the Implications for Biodiversity: A review of recent findings and the status of policy reforms|year=2003|page=4|publisher=Vth World Parks Congress: Sustainable Finance Stream.|location=Durban, South Africa|url=http://conservationfinance.org/guide/WPC/WPC_documents/Overview_PanB_Wolcott_v2.pdf|coauthors=Wolcott, R., and Quintela, C.E.}}</ref> These promote the expansion of fishing fleets, the supply of larger and longer nets, larger yields and indiscriminate catch, as well as mitigating risks which encourages further investment into large-scale operations to the disfavour of the already struggling small-scale industry.<ref name="Robin et al 2003" /><ref name="Porter 1998">{{cite web|last=Porter|first=G.|title=Natural Resource Subsidies, Trade and Environment: The Cases of Forest and Fisheries|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/NaturalResourceSubsidies.pdf|work=Center for Environmental Law|accessdate=05/08/2013|year=1998}}</ref> Collectively, these result in the continued overcapitalization and overfishing of marine fisheries.

====Others====
With the National Football League ([[NFL]]) profit topping records at $11 billion, the highest of all sports. Attention is beginning to look at the NFL's tax-exemption status<ref name="Roodman 2005">{{cite web|last=Roodman|first=D.|title=Production-weighted Estimates of Aggregate Protection in Rich Countries toward Developing Countries - Working Paper 66|url=http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/3534_file_WP_66.pdf|work=Center for Global Development|accessdate=15/04/2013|year=2005}}</ref> and all the stadiums built through tax-free borrowing by the cities, resulting from subsidies out of the pockets of every American taxpayer.<ref name="Cohen 2008">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=R.|title=Playing by the NFL's Tax Exempt Rulesh|url=http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3056:playing-by-the-nfls-tax-exempt-rules&catid=149:rick-cohen&Itemid=117|publisher=NonProfit Quaterly|accessdate=15/04/2013|year=2008}}</ref>

The Commitment to Development Index, published by the [[Center for Global Development]], measures the effect that subsidies and trade barriers actually have on the undeveloped world. It uses trade along with six other components such as aid or investment to rank and evaluate developed countries on policies that affect the undeveloped world. It finds that the richest countries spend $106 billion per year subsidizing their own farmers - almost exactly as much as they spend on foreign aid.<ref name="Fowler and fokker 2004">{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=P.|title=A Sweeter Future?
