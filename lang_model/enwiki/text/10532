There are several main '''characters in ''[[Carniv<U+00E0>le]]''''', an American [[television series|television]] [[serial drama]] set in the United States [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Dust Bowl]] between 1934 and 1935. It aired on [[HBO]] between 2003 and 2005. The show traces the disparate storylines of an ensemble of fictional characters revolving around two main characters: young Ben Hawkins working in a [[traveling carnival]], and a [[California]] preacher named Brother Justin Crowe. 

''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' has a large cast, amounting to eighteen main cast actors over its two-season run. Most characters are introduced in Ben's storyline: Samson, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] co-running the carnival with Management; Jonesy, Samson's right-hand man with a crippling knee injury; Apollonia and Sofie, two [[fortuneteller]]s working a mother-daughter act; Lodz, a blind [[mentalist]], and his lover, Lila the [[Bearded Lady]]; the cootch ([[striptease]]) Dreifuss family; [[snake charmer]] Ruthie and her son Gabriel, a [[Strongman (circus)|strongman]]; and many other [[sideshow]] performers. The supporting characters of Brother Justin's storyline are his sister Iris, his mentor Reverend Norman Balthus, radio show host Tommy Dolan, and convict Varlyn Stroud. Several characters appear in mysterious dreams and visions connecting the slowly converging storylines.

Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]]'s original story pitch to HBO included elaborate character biographies, which he gave to the actors, the writers and the studio as an overview over the series' intended plot. These biographies were rewritten before the filming of the first season began. Receiving little to no mention in the series afterwards, the original character backgrounds were summarized on the official HBO website. After the show's cancellation, the writers revealed future character arcs and forwarded all original biographies to fans as part of the show's so-called "Pitch Document". Due to their nature, these sources do not offer [[canon (fiction)|canon]] information per se, but provide a frame for the characters' motivation throughout the series. 

The thematic and period setting of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks to fit the 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.

==Character conception==

Conceiving the initial script for ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' between 1990 and 1992, [[Daniel Knauf]] set its plot in a carnival environment in the 1930s [[Dust Bowl]], which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He had grown up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. [[Freak show|Freaks]] of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period.<ref name=theage /><ref name=dvd_making>{{cite video |title=Carniv<U+00E0>le: Complete Season 1 &ndash; "Making of Carniv<U+00E0>le" |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video |date=2004}}</ref><ref name=hbo_dknauf /> Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le|complex fictional universe]] based on a [[good and evil|good versus evil]] theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to [[HBO]], Knauf presented ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' as a collection of media samples from the perspective of a fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' characters.<ref name=pitch_summary /> The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure.

==Ben Hawkins==

Ben Krohn Hawkins is the [[protagonist]] in ''Carniv<U+00E0>le''. He begins the story as a young [[Oklahoma]] farmer and [[chain gang]] fugitive who is picked up by a [[traveling carnival]] when his mother dies. Ben has displayed inexplicable healing powers since childhood, and with the beginning of the series, he has begun to suffer dreams and visions of people unknown to him. As Ben learns from staying with the carnival, he seems to be related to Henry Scudder, a man who once worked at the carnival. He also learns that his powers come with a price &ndash; to give life, he must take life; to raise the dead, he has to deliberately kill someone else. When the beginning of season 2 makes the mysterious happenings in the carnival clearer, Ben is told to find the preacher of his dreams to prevent an unfolding chain of catastrophic events. Henry Scudder, at this point revealed to be Ben's father, allegedly knows the preacher's name, and after a number of near misses and harrowing encounters, Ben is able to bring Scudder before the carnival's Management. A fight ensues in which Ben is forced to kill Management, leaving him a full understanding of his powers. Season 2 concludes with Ben's setting out to confront Brother Justin in California, where they finally meet in battle in a cornfield. The carnies find Brother Justin slain and Ben passed out from his own grievous wounds. They take Ben back to their camp and leave New Canaan.<ref name=episodes>''[[Carniv<U+00E0>le]]''.

===Background and development===

As his powers and use of powers already suggest in the series, Ben is an [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Avataric Creature of Light]].<ref name=bally_dan /> An early draft of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'', which consisted of diary entries by Benjamin "Ben" Hawkins, summarized his childhood as growing up on a run-down farm with his mother and grandfather in the belief that his father had died in the [[Great War]]. After both his grandfather and mother had died from [[cancer]], he was "[[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] by a group of [[carnies]]" in 1930.<ref name=pitch_summary /> In a later version closer to the actual series, Ben left his mother's farm at age sixteen and fell into a criminal life in [[Texas]]. After receiving a twenty-year sentence in a state prison-farm for a failed [[bank robbery]], Ben planned his escape to return home to his sick mother, but he accidentally killed a prison guard who drew a gun on him.<ref name=pitch_summary /> Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] gave the latter as Ben's chain gang background in the series.<ref name=chat_milfay />

The writers always intended Ben to be the leading man and hero of the series, and were looking for an actor to showcase a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality.<ref name = hbo_jpap/> Of the many actors auditioning, the producers found that Nick Stahl brought a "particular introspection" to the character, "project[ing] a great deal of sensitivity, of quiet intelligence, of pain."<ref name=milfay_ac /> They also felt that his seemingly little-trained physique worked well for the 1930s period.<ref name=milfay_ac>{{cite video |people=[[Daniel Knauf]], [[Howard Klein]], [[Rodrigo Garcia]] |title=Carniv<U+00E0>le: Complete Season 1 &ndash; "Milfay" audio commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video |date=2004}}</ref> Nick Stahl, who interpreted Ben as "very stoic", "very quiet", with a "dual nature" and a "real internal struggle going on", embraced this role as a personal challenge.<ref name=dvd_museum />

===<span id="Reception_of_Ben_Hawkins" />Reception===

In reviewing the first three episodes, ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that "Ben is a taciturn hero, and Mr. Stahl does a remarkable job of wordlessly conveying his character's moods and yearnings, as well as his ungainly grace."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | last=Stanley |first=Alessandra | title=TV WEEKEND; Carnies, Dust Bowl, Apocalypse | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3DF103BF931A2575AC0A9659C8B63 |date=September 12, 2003 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' regarded "Stahl, with his watchful eyes, [as] one of the show's strengths. He has a boyish face, but the grim expression of a worn-out elder",<ref name=boston /> and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said Stahl "speaks volumes with his eyes and weary frown, so much so that his understated portrayal almost carries the series."<ref>{{cite web |last=McFarland |first=Melanie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/149015_tv20.html |title=HBO is running a con game with 'Carnivale' |publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> In a season 1 DVD review, [[DVD Talk]] thought that "as the two leads, Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown are nothing short of brilliant. Ben Hawkins is a very isolated and quiet character, and yet he carries a significant part of the series on his shoulders. Without the right actor it could be disastrous, but Stahl brings a level of thoughtful emotion to the character such that a glance or a stare speaks volumes."<ref name=dvdtalk_1 /> DVDverdict felt in a season 2 review that "both Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown deliver perfect performances. Stahl's gradual acceptance of his own power, and his subsequent struggle, are fascinating."<ref name=dvdverdict>{{cite web |last=Pearce |first=Judge Joel |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/carnivaleseason1.php |title=Carnivale: The Complete First Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=January 12, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>

==Brother Justin Crowe==
[[File:CBrown.jpg|thumb|Clancy Brown played Brother Justin]]

Brother Justin Crowe is the antagonist in ''Carniv<U+00E0>le''; reviewers also saw in him a possible alternate protagonist.<ref name=mw_20041120-1>{{cite news |last=Mahadevan |first=Jeremy |title=Come Join The Carnivale |publisher=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire |date=October 10, 2004}} ([http://web.archive.org/web/20070103161250/http://themidway.org/reviews/20041010-01.html Archived version] retrieved on 2007-10-20.)</ref> Brother Justin is introduced as a [[Methodist]] [[minister (religion)|minister]] who resides with his sister Iris in the small town of Mintern, California. As the series reveals in later episodes, Justin's birth name is Alexei Belyakov. He and his sister Iris are orphaned immigrant children in the wilderness, who were found and raised by Reverend Norman Balthus. Following strange visions and supernatural abilities in the pilot episode, Brother Justin erects a church in his God's name. But after a fire in his new ministry leads him almost to suicide, Brother Justin is hospitalized in a [[sanatarium]] and discovers his ability to manipulate and control those around him through sheer force of will. Shortly after Brother Justin's return to Mintern, Norman suspects his foster son to be possessed by a demon and confronts him, but Brother Justin is not disturbed by his true nature for long. In the beginning of season 2, Brother Justin has begun to gather a huge flock of worshippers of mostly migrants and [[Okies]] outside Mintern via his nightly radio sermons and newfound abilities of persuasion. A scholar named Wilfred Talbot Smith identifies him as the ''[[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Usher]]'' and tells him that, in order to gain his full measure of power and fulfill his destiny, he must find and kill a man named Henry Scudder. While escaped convict Varlyn Stroud helps Brother Justin, the Crowes find a new chambermaid in ex-carny Sofie, not knowing that she is Brother Justin's daughter. Brother Justin at long last meets his adversary, Ben, in the final episode of the series. Brother Justin is killed in a battle in a cornfield near his home, but Sofie as the ''[[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Omega]]'' arrives and places her hands on his chest, causing the corn stalks around them to wither and fall away.<ref name=episodes />

Besides being the ''Usher'', Brother Justin is also an [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Avataric Creature of Dark]].<ref name=bally_dan /> His spiritual presentation in the series, the [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#The Tattooed Man and the tree|Tattooed Man]], was portrayed by [[Don Swayze]]. Show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] saw in Brother Justin "one of the most complex devils",<ref name=ac_lincoln_highway /> and envisioned [[Christopher Walken]] to play him when he wrote the first draft of the show.<ref name=chat_milfay>{{cite web |url=http://www.savecarnivale.org/html/carniecast_071705.htm |title=Highlights from the Dan Knauf Chat &ndash; Episode 1 &ndash; Milfay |date=July 17, 2005 |publisher=savecarnivale.org |accessdate=2007-07-28}}</ref> Knauf originally designed Brother Justin as a preacher far along in his career as well as a recurring instead of a regular character, "much more evolved towards the dark side."<ref name=milfay_ac /> An early draft of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' gave Brother Justin's real name as Lucius Crowe, a radio preacher who advocated ethnic hatred, especially for [[Romani people|Gypsies]] and carnival folk. It also mentioned Brother Justin joining "The Order of the Knights of Jericho" between 1921 and 1923 and becoming its head in 1926. The completion of the construction of his "Temple of Jericho" was set in [[Nebraska]] in 1928. At the series' start initially projected to occur in 1930, the character had already gathered a great army of followers through his "Church of the Air" radio sermons.<ref name=pitch_summary />

After seeing the preliminary pilot episode, however, Knauf and the producers realized there was no room for the character to grow in a television series. They demoted Brother Justin to an ordinary [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in a little town, but when Brother Justin's affiliation needed to be decided, Knauf contested plans to make him a [[Catholic]] priest; he rather settled on the [[Methodist]] denomination, which he perceived as significantly less suspicious and controversial.<ref name = carni_iw_jan04/><ref name = yahoo_msg29014/> Although Brother Justin shares traits with [[Father Coughlin]], an Irish Catholic priest who broadcasted his sermons over the radio in the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.<ref name=tca>Summer 2003 Cable TCA Press Tour (July 10, 2003).

Samson, in earlier drafts also called Edgar Leiber<ref name=pitch_summary /> or Edgar Leonhardt,<ref name=hbo_cast_sam /> is the [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] co-manager of the Carniv<U+00E0>le. His original biography gave his background as a dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on [[traveling carnival]]s, including the Hyde&nbsp;&&nbsp;Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager until another character, Management, [[#Emergence of the Carniv<U+00E0>le|purchased the carnival]] (to be renamed Carniv<U+00E0>le) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist.<ref name=hbo_cast_sam>{{cite web |title=Samson &ndash; Played by Michael J.

Clayton "Jonesy" Jones is an ex-baseball player who suffers from a crippling knee injury. He is Samson's right-hand man, operator of the [[Ferris wheel]], and the leader of the [[roustabout]]s. Jonesy's original biography reveals his past as a star [[pitcher]] in the [[Major League Baseball|major league]] whose knee was injured in revenge when he refused to throw a game for the mob. Slipping to the edge of society, Jonesy joined the Carniv<U+00E0>le and found redemption in the eyes of young Sofie.

Apollonia and Sofie Agnesh Bojakshiya<ref name=hbo_cast_ab_sab /> are [[fortuneteller]]s in a mother-daughter act at the carnival. Although Apollonia is [[catatonic]], she and Sofie can communicate [[telepathic]]ally.

Nevertheless, season 2 shows Apollonia repeatedly appearing to Sofie and snake charmer Ruthie. Sofie tries to leave her fortuneteller life behind by becoming a [[roustabout]]. After a short-lived relationship with Ben, Sofie leaves the carnival altogether and becomes the Crowes' maid in [[California]]. Brother Justin introduces her to the world of religion, but several signs suggest the preacher is not the good man Sofie thought. After berating Brother Justin in the final episode, Sofie is locked in a barn where visions insinuate her as the Omega and Brother Justin as her father. She later shoots Jonesy, and her eyes have taken on the coal black appearance of Brother Justin's eyes. The final minutes of the series show Sofie finding Brother Justin dead in a cornfield. She lays her hands on his chest, and the corn around them dies.<ref name=episodes />

===Lodz===

* Played by [[Patrick Bauchau]] (season 1 main cast, season 2 recurring)

Professor Ernst Lodz<ref name=hbo_cast_lodz /> is a blind [[mentalist]]. As revealed both in the show and in his original biography, he has a [[#Emergence of the Carniv<U+00E0>le|long history with the Carniv<U+00E0>le]]. Lodz's character arc starts with Ben joining the carnival. Lodz unsuccessfully hassles the boy to work with him and to listen to his dreams. He later initiates Ruthie's death with Management's blessing to get his sight back. Upon finding out these circumstances, Ben strangles Lodz to death, reviving Ruthie in the process. Nevertheless, Lodz repeatedly appears to Ruthie and leaves her the message "Sofie is the ''[[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Omega]]''" on a mirror. Using Ruthie's body, Lodz also visits his lover Lila and informs her about the events leading to his death and "you'll be seeing me soon [...] in the flesh."<ref name=episodes /><ref name=cheyenne_wy>{{cite episode | title = Cheyenne, WY |episodelink=List of Carniv<U+00E0>le episodes | series = Carniv<U+00E0>le | serieslink = Carniv<U+00E0>le | credits = [[Todd Field]] | writers = [[Tracy Torm<U+00E9>]] | network = [[HBO]] | airdate = 2005-03-13 | season = 2 | number = 10}}</ref> Lodz's final appearance as Ruthie was not supposed to be his last. According to Clancy Brown (Brother Justin), the writers had originally planned Lodz's return as a [[mummy]] after a man sold his [[Desiccation|desiccated]] body to the carnies.<ref name=chat_cb2 /> Lodz's demise in season 1 however was planned from the beginning.

The family traveled the international circuit as the "Flying Villalobos" until misfortune struck. One of Lila's two older brothers died in [[Copenhagen]] in 1905, and her father committed suicide in 1908. At age sixteen, Lila already sported a beard and married for the first time. The marriage did not last long, and Lila would marry over nineteen more times in her life. Lodz would be her only [[Romantic love|true love]].<ref name=hbo_cast_lila>{{cite web |title=Lila &ndash; Played by Debra Christofferson |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/cast/character/lila.shtml |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref><ref name=bally_debra>{{cite web |last=Blighton |first=Beth |url=http://www.carnycon.com/bally/debra.html |title=Debra Christofferson Interview |publisher=carnycon.com |date=February 12, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> Lila's arc of the first season is limited to being with Lodz until she notices his growing contact with Management. His sudden disappearance at the beginning of season 2 however make her suspicious. Samson's subsequent evasive behavior suggests external forces, but Lila finds herself unable to obtain proof. Ruthie repeatedly approaches Lila at night, seemingly possessed by Lodz, and leaves her clues. When Lila finally learns of the circumstances surrounding Lodz's death, she suborns the carnival crew to a [[mutiny]] that almost prevents the troupe from meeting with Brother Justin in [[California]].<ref name=episodes />

Scudder also had a relationship with Ben's mother once; Samson later confirms Scudder as Ben's father. Season 2 forces both Ben and Brother Justin to find Scudder for their own purposes. After a long journey, Ben finds Scudder in Damascus, Nebraska and brings him to the carnival's Management.

Unknown at first, he is also the carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson.

In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, and urges him to find and bring Scudder to him.

Although ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' is set in the mid-1930s, Ben and Brother Justin have visions and dreams suggesting the story began much earlier. Samson summarizes the backstory in a monologue at the beginning of season 2, without mentioning names. The Pitch Document, which served as the source for the character biographies on the HBO website, provides context for all clues.

The carnival's backstory begins at the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a [[Russians|Russian]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] from [[Minsk]] and officer in the [[Tsar]]'s army, became aware of his [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Avataric powers]]. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two children to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in [[Battle of Lemberg (1914)|Lemberg in 1914]], Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions.<ref name=pitch_summary /> Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].<ref name = hbo_cast_hs/> Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped [[circus]] [[bear]] feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured he would lose an arm and both legs.<ref name=pitch_summary />

Scudder escaped and encountered carnival performer Lodz on the battlefield, searching for his bear Bruno. When Scudder joined Lodz's troupe, Lodz recognized and cultivated Scudder's supernatural abilities, and they started to perform in the salons of war-torn Europe. Meanwhile, Belyakov slowly recovered from his wounds and learned about his true nature and destiny through devoted study of ancient manuscripts. Scudder could feel Belyakov tracking his movements and never stayed long in one area.<ref name=pitch_summary /> Growing impatient, Lodz got into a fight with Scudder about his skills and was gifted with [[telepathy|mindreading]] in exchange for his sense of sight.<ref name=hbo_cast_lodz>{{cite web |title=Lodz &ndash; Played by Patrick Bauchau |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/cast/character/lodz.shtml |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> Scudder returned to America in 1915 to flee his nightmares. Several months later, Belyakov located the broken-down Lodz in [[Venice]]. Belyakov noticed the mental bond between Lodz and Scudder the power transfer had caused, and promised to restore Lodz's sight if he helped in finding Scudder.<ref name=pitch_summary /><ref name=hbo_cast_hs />

Scudder fell in love and married a local girl named Flora Hawkins from [[Milfay, Oklahoma]], with whom he had a son, Ben.<ref name=hbo_cast_hs /> When Scudder felt his pursuing enemy again, he left his family and traveled aimlessly throughout the country. After narrowly surviving a cave-in in Babylon, he joined the Hyde&nbsp;&&nbsp;Teller Company, a small carnival working the southeastern circuit. Scudder worked as a [[geek show|sideshow geek]] for nearly a year and got to know Samson, Jonesy, Possum, Lila, Ruthie and Gabriel.<ref name=pitch_summary /> Meanwhile, Belyakov used Lodz's tracking skills and purchased the Hyde&nbsp;&&nbsp;Teller Company, scantily missing Scudder.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Hot and Bothered |episodelink=List of Carniv<U+00E0>le episodes | series = Carniv<U+00E0>le | serieslink = Carniv<U+00E0>le | credits = [[Jeremy Podeswa]] | writers = [[Dawn Prestwich]] and [[Nicole Yorkin]] | network = [[HBO]] | airdate = 2003-11-16 | season = 1 | number = 10}}

While Lodz embitteredly waited for Management to fulfill his earlier promise of restoring his sight, Samson ran the show, counseled by Management and assisted by Jonesy. Eighteen years went by until Management felt Ben Hawkins, whom he had sensed as his Ascendant since birth, was old enough to be approached.<ref name=pitch_summary /> At this point, the first season of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' resumes the story.

Brother Justin Crowe is introduced as a devoted Methodist minister, who is supported by his sister Iris. On a self-discovery trip in the middle of the first season, Brother Justin has an elaborate vision of two Russian immigrant children, Irina and her younger brother Alexei; Irina talks of her evil father.

==Casting==

The [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] approach for ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' was to find the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on [[freak show|freak]] illusions too much. ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'''s casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as [[Los Angeles]] is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as [[Adrienne Barbeau]] (Ruthie).<ref name=hbo_jpap>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/casting_directors.shtml |title="Beyond the Standard Fare" &ndash; John Papsidera |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref><ref name=backstagewest>{{cite web |last=Kelly-Saxenmeyer |first=Anne |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4384997-1.html |title=Freak Show |publisher=Back Stage West |date=May 15, 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show would go afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters. [[Nick Stahl]] had the strongest consensus among the producers to portray the leading man and hero of the series with a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality.<ref name=hbo_jpap /> The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic [[Romani people|gypsy]] girl, but [[Clea DuVall]], a movie actress trying to become involved in regular television, got the part after four auditions. [[Tim DeKay]], who had previously worked with Daniel Knauf on a pilot episode of a different project, was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a "very American" looking [[baseball player]] of the 1930s period.<ref name=dvd_museum>{{cite video |people=[[Nick Stahl]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Tim DeKay]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]] |title=Carniv<U+00E0>le: Complete Season 2 &ndash; The Museum of Television & Radio's William S.

The filmed pilot episode served as basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines.<ref name=chat_milfay /> The expanded role of Brother Justin encouraged the creation of his sister Iris in a supporting role, for which [[Amy Madigan]] was cast. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch ([[striptease]]) Dreifuss family; a ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.<ref name=milfay_ac /><ref name=carni_iw_jan04>{{cite web |last=Blighton |first=Beth |url=http://carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_archive.html |title=Interview with Daniel Knauf &ndash; Part 1 |date=January 12, 2004 |publisher=carnivaleinterviews.blogspot.com |accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> [[Cynthia Ettinger]] (Rita Sue Dreifuss) had lost her role as [[Martha Kent]] in the pilot episode of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' before the opportunity for ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' came up and had turned to theater jobs; she chose ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' because of the theater-like experience.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kendt |first=Rob |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/wicked_little_town/2003/10/give_up_and_get.html |title=Give Up and Get "Carniv<U+00E1>le" |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=October 31, 2003 |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> [[Amanda Aday]] (Dora Mae Dreifuss) knew she would join the cast for only a few episodes, but was not told the story reasons at that point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savecarnivale.org/html/carniecast_072405_mja.htm |title=Highlights from the Chat with Michael J.

Genetic disorders or unusual body features are not uncommon among ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' actors. Michael J.

==Make-up and costumes==

To give the illusion of being [[freak show|freaks]], the appearance of several actors was modified by make-up elements. [[John Fleck (actor)|John Fleck]] (Gecko) spent over ten hours in makeup each day to transform into and out of his character. The skin, which needed to look like alligator hide, consisted of seven or eight separate pieces and needed to be glued to Fleck's face.<ref name=scifi_jf>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-tv.html?2003-08/12/11.00.tv |title=Fleck Romances Carnivale |publisher=''[[Sci Fi Wire]]'' |date=August 12, 2003 |accessdate=2007-10-14| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050407214639/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-tv.html?2003-08/12/11.00.tv| archivedate = April 7, 2005}}</ref> [[Patrick Bauchau]] (Lodz) had several contact lenses pairs of different opaqueness. While one pair enabled him to see shapes, another pair made him basically blind and he had to be led around the set.<ref name=bally_debra /> [[Debra Christofferson]] (Lila) had a fake beard applied to her chin; the beard was custom-made by hand-tying human hair onto lace that would disappear when the beard was glued onto the skin. The beard of the early episodes was so heavy that the chemicals caused Christofferson's skin to be raw at the end of the shooting day, and was later split into three pieces. Christofferson still needed to be careful with mouth movements. According to the actress, "the beard actually determined Lila's voice."<ref name=bally_debra /><ref name=launchpad />

Establishing the characters' background rather than prettiness was the main goal of costumes. Ben wore the same clothes in both seasons, and to make them look identical, around twenty multiples of his coveralls were made by hand. It took over six weeks to apply all stitches, patches and the roughly fifty holes, plus the aging process. Brother Justin's clothes were made period-correct from the beginning, but the character's foreboding presence was enhanced by fitting his frock on the waist and making the shoulders look bigger than usual for that time period. Sofie's clothes had a strong [[Bohemia]]n Eastern influence to portray her mother's origin and sensibilities. Stumpy's wardrobe consisted of [[baggy pants]] and an Italian [[bowler hat]] that gave him a 1920s look instead of the 1930s, showing his clothes were [[second-hand]]. The stripper clothes of Rita Sue and Libby were influenced by [[Mae West]], [[harlot]] movies and silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, with additional research put into Asian harlots, [[Latin dance]]rs and [[Hawaii]]an dancers. The costume designers chose the costumes of the Daily Brothers Show, a rival carnival, to have a new color tone to set them apart from the Carniv<U+00E0>le. The dress of Sabina the Scorpion Lady underwent several die-bleaching cycles to achieve a red-orange-purple color that would work well when filming outside. Bert/Bertha's costume was made in a hurry from a vintage tuxedo and an old feathered dress, which helped to give it a "made-it-on-the-road" feeling.<ref name=cts_cii>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/behind/creating_the_scene/index.html |title=Creating the Scene &ndash; Carniv<U+00E0>le II |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

In 2004, ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' won a Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award<ref name=launchpad>{{cite journal | title = Freak Show | journal = Beauty Launchpad | pages = 84&ndash;87 | month = March | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2007-11-22 }}</ref> and two [[Emmy]]s in the categories "Outstanding Costumes for a Series" and "Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series".

Wendy Tuohy of the Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' stated that show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] "sprinkled enough magical gifts over the carnival's cast of mind readers, fortunetellers, snake charmers, catatonic psychics, conjoined twins, bearded ladies and lizard men to make the bizarre and the macabre appear just about routine."<ref name=theage>{{cite web |last=Tuohy |first=Wendy |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Freaking-hell/2004/12/14/1102787083353.html |title=Freaking hell |date=December 16, 2004 |publisher=''[[The Age]]'' |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> Matt Casamassina of [[IGN]] added that "from the opening sequence to the fade out on episode 12 [of season 1], ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' successfully draws you into the Depression-engulfed world of its many oddly likeable characters. And sure enough, odd best describes these people [...] The show prominently features all manners of freaks, but each is well-crafted, layered, and believable, rather than comical, as easily could have been the case under amateur direction."<ref name=ign_s1>{{cite web | last=Casamassina | first=Matt | title = Carnivale &ndash; The Complete First Season | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/572/572339p1.html | date=December 10, 2004 | publisher=''[[IGN]]'' | accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> [[MSNBC]] acknowledged the characters "speak[ing] in a dialogue that feels authentic, even if that authenticity is a modern interpretation [...] Carniv<U+00E0>le manager Samson, [[Michael J.

While [[HBO]] entertainment president Carolyn Strauss felt ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' had come to a natural end with its second season and gave this as the network's explanation for not renewing ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'',<ref name=variety_cancellation>{{cite news |last=Adalian |first=Josef |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117922539.html?categoryid=1417&cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' packing up |date=May 11, 2005 |publisher=variety.com |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> it was reported HBO president [[Chris Albrecht]] had originally wanted to conclude the second season of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' with a satisfying and close-ended confrontation between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger,<ref name=zap2it>{{cite web |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C96426%7C1%7C,00.html |title='Carniv<U+00E0>le' Fans Besiege HBO with E-mails |date=July 18, 2005 |publisher=zap2it.com |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref name=toledo>{{cite web |last=Owen |first=Rob  |url=http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050720/ART18/507200317 |title = Funny business |date=July 20, 2005 | publisher=toledoblade.com | accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> but show creator [[Daniel Knauf]] stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene in the writing phase, budgeting the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement.<ref name=yahoo_msg20320>{{cite web |author=Knauf, Daniel (fboffo) |authorlink=Daniel Knauf |url=http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/23239 |title=Re: S2 Finale: Might-have-beens/Implications? |publisher=Yahoo Carnivale HBO (registration required) |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-27}}</ref> However, [[Clancy Brown]] (Brother Justin) remembers the original last shot of the series as Iris watching the corn die, not of Ben in Management's trailer.<ref name=chat_cb2>{{cite web |url=http://www.savecarnivale.org/html/carniecast_clancy.htm |title=Highlights from the Clancy Brown Chat |publisher=savecarnivale.org |date=September 18, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref>

Following the cancellation, the writers did not immediately answer fan questions about the characters' future, arguing the story ideas should not be revealed just for instant fan gratification and should wait to be told until the opportunity arises.<ref name=yahoo_msg20373>{{cite web |author=Knauf, Daniel (fboffo) |authorlink=Daniel Knauf |url=http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/CarnivaleHBO/message/20373 |title=Re: in response to dan's letter |publisher=Yahoo Carnivale HBO (registration required) |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> They later provided clues in DVD special features and at conventions, in forums and in online chats.

Writer and co-executive producer [[William Schmidt (TV writer)|William Schmidt]] described Sofie's last seen action as "raising her father at the end, bringing him back to life."<ref name=magic_and_myth /> This was "to indicate that she was truly evil", although "she is the ''[[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Avatars|Omega]]'' so there's good in her too."<ref name=magic_and_myth /> The third season "would have been pretty much centered on Sofie and the internal struggle of her [[good and evil|good versus evil]]."<ref name=magic_and_myth /> The nature of the Omega would have taken two seasons to unfold.<ref name=yahoo_msg18955 />

Brother Justin would have been "severely weakened and prone to exhaustion, serving as a hollow figurehead in his burgeoning ministry.
