'''Gerald Francis O'Keefe''' (March 30, 1918 &ndash; April 12, 2000) was a 20th century [[bishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[United States]].  He served as [[auxiliary bishop]] for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Archdiocese of St. Paul]] in the state of [[Minnesota]] from 1961<U+2013>1966 and bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport|Diocese of Davenport]] in the state of [[Iowa]] from 1966-1993.

==Biography==

===Early Life & Ministry===
Gerald O<U+2019>Keefe was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] to Francis and Lucille (McDonald) O<U+2019>Keefe.  He had a younger sister and grew up in suburban [[Wayzata, Minnesota]]. His father worked as a railroad signal man.  O'Keefe was educated in the city's public schools.  He graduated from the [[University of Saint Thomas (Minnesota)|College of Saint Thomas]] and studied for the priesthood at [[Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity|St. Paul Seminary]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].  He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of St. Paul on January 29, 1944.  He was assigned to the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Saint Paul|Cathedral of St. Paul]] and served briefly as a teacher at [[St. Thomas Military Academy]] in St. Paul, after which he served the archdiocese as vice chancellor and then [[chancellor]]. <ref name>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Madeleine M.|title=Seasons of Growth: History of the Diocese of Davenport|year=1981|publisher=Diocese of Davenport|location=Davenport, Iowa|pages=246<U+2013>7}}</ref>  He also served as [[chaplain]] to a convent of [[Benedictine]] Nuns.

On May 5, 1961 [[Pope]] [[Blessed John XXIII]] appointed O'Keefe [[Titular Bishop]] of ''Candyba'' and [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of St. Paul.  He was consecrated by Archbishop [[William O. Brady]] on July 2, 1961 in the Cathedral of St. Paul.  Bishops [[James Joseph Byrne|James J. Byrne]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise|Boise]] and [[Hilary Baumann Hacker|Hillary B. Hacker]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bismarck|Bismarck]] were the principal co-consecrators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bokeefe.html|title=Bishop Gerald Francis O'Keefe|publisher=www.catholic-hierarchy.org|accessdate=2007-02-04
}}</ref>  He was named [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the cathedral parish and in 1962 [[vicar general]] of the archdiocese.  While he was one of the auxiliary bishops of St. Paul, Bishop O'Keefe participated in all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_25_36/ai_62087436|title=ADDENDA|publisher=www.findarticles.com|accessdate=2007-02-04|last=Malcolm|first=Teresa | year=2000}}</ref>

===Bishop of Davenport===
On October 20, 1966 Bishop O'Keefe was appointed by Pope [[Paul VI]] as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport. He was installed on January 4, 1967 by Archbishop James J. Byrne of Dubuque at Davenport<U+2019>s [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].  In attendance was the largest gathering of Catholic hierarchy in the cathedral<U+2019>s history: 4 archbishops, 1 abbot and 41 bishops.  There was also 24 [[Protestant]] clergy, 300 priests, 200 sisters and two lay people from every parish in the diocese.  For the first time in 22 years women were allowed to sing in the choir at the cathedral, after having been banned by Bishop [[Ralph Leo Hayes|Hayes]].<ref>Schmidt, 247</ref>

===Period of Reform & Renewal===
During his 26 years of service in Davenport, Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe put into place the reforms and spirit of the Second Vatican Council.  The [[Presbyteral Council|Priests<U+2019> Senate]] had been established just prior to his appointment to the diocese.  A Sister's Council, representing the members of religious orders of women in the diocese, was established in 1967 as was the Lay Council. In March 1970 O<U+2019>Keefe established the first diocesan pastoral council, which included members of the clergy, religious orders and the laity.   A Diocesan Board of Education was also established early in his episcopate.  Procedures for due process, recommended by the [[Canon Law Society of America]], were put in place in the late 1960s as well.  In 1978 he established the [[deacon|diaconate]] in the diocese as its own ministry and not just for those pursuing the priesthood. The first class of deacons was ordained December 13, 1980.  A Deacons Council, similar to those for the priests, sisters and laity was also organized.

[[File:St. Vincent Center Davenport Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St. Vincent's Home became the Diocesan Pastoral Center in the 1970s.]]
St. Vincent<U+2019>s Home, which had taken care of orphaned and abandoned children since 1897, was discontinued in 1968.  The following year [[Catholic Charities]] was replaced with the Office of Social Action under the leadership of the Rev. [[Marvin Mottet]].   In 1974 Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe established the diocesan pastoral center and residence for both retired and active priests in the former St. Vincent's Home.  Offices of Religious Education and Family Life were also established.

Ministry to [[Latinos]] became a priority in the diocese.  As early as the post-[[World War]] I era Spanish-speaking people came into the diocese in noticeable numbers.  Their numbers ebbed during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].  In the 1950s [[migrant workers]] entered the diocese to work the farm fields around [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]] and their numbers started to increase slowly after that.  Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe joined with Bishops [[Arthur Joseph O'Neill|Arthur O<U+2019>Neil]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockford|Rockford]] and [[John Baptist Franz|John Franz]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria|Peoria]] to create an office that assisted migrant workers with job and education services.  In 1972 the Social Action department established an Immigration Office.  Priests were also sent to [[Mexico]] to learn Spanish and to be immersed in the culture.   Three Spanish-speaking deacons were ordained in 1981.<ref>Schmidt, 290-4</ref>

Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe called two Diocesan [[Synod]]s into existence, the fourth and fifth for the diocese.  The 1974 synod was the first since 1932 and included vowed religious and the laity for the first time.  The synod focused on spiritual renewal, unifying and restructuring the diocese.  The 1985 synod also focused on restructuring the diocese based on the recent reforms of the [[Code of Canon Law]].

The diocese celebrated its [[centennial]] in 1981.  Sr. Madeleine Marie Schmidt, CHM wrote a diocesan history, and a large liturgy was celebrated at Sacred Heart Cathedral.  In attendance was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Patrick Cody]] of Chicago. A choir of voices from throughout the diocese was formed to provide the music.

===Changing Demographics===
Throughout his years as the bishop of the diocese O'Keefe saw the number of priests and religious serving the diocese decline.  At the same time he saw the numbers of lay people active in ministry increase.  The population of the diocese, however, remained stable.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddave.html |title=Diocese of Davenport |publisher=www.catholic-hierarchy.org |accessdate=2010-06-03 }}</ref>  The [[economic recession]] that hit rural America in the 1980s did have an effect on the diocesan population and resources. In 1991 he announced a plan for clustering and closing smaller parishes, which reflected both the decline in the number of priests and the rural population in Iowa.  The diocese also witnessed a decline in enrollment in Catholic Schools, which led to the merger or closing of schools across Southeast Iowa.<ref>Schmidt, 158-62</ref>  Catholic hospitals were also affected.  In 1970 there were ten hospitals in the diocese and by the time O<U+2019>Keefe left office they were reduced to three.<ref>Schmidt, 297</ref>

[[Saint Ambrose University|St. Ambrose]] and [[Marycrest International University|Marycrest]] Colleges worked on a merger in the early 1970s, but in the end they decided against it. Both schools became [[co-educational]] in the late 1960s.   St. Ambrose hired its first lay president, Dr. [[William Bakrow]], in 1973, and started its first [[Master<U+2019>s Degree]] program in [[Master of Business Administration|Business Administration]] in 1979.  It continued to grow and became a university in 1987.  Marycrest started to decline.  In 1990 it began an affiliation with the Teikyo Yamanashi Education and Welfare Foundation of [[Japan]] as a way to stay open and viable.  It was renamed Teikyo Marycrest University.

Ottumwa Heights College, like Marycrest, was operated by the [[Congregation of the Humility of Mary]], merged with [[Indian Hills Community College]] in 1979.  The Sisters of Humility, who had been headquartered in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]] since the 1880s, built a new headquarters and convent on the property of St. Vincent Center in Davenport in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chmiowa.org/heritage.cfm |title=Our Spirit

===Later life & Death===
In February 1992 Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe was sued by two women in Minnesota for having sexually abused them when he was rector of St. Paul Cathedral in the early 1960s.   Both women were young girls at the time, and credited recovering [[repressed memories]] for their accusations.  Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe denied the charges.  A year later he was cleared of any wrongdoing after it was determined the women suffered from mental illnesses and made up the stories while in therapy.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/us/beliefs-526093.html|title= Beliefs |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2010-06-03 |last= Steinfels| first=Peter | date=July 10, 1993}}</ref>

On November 12, 1993 [[Blessed John Paul II]] accepted Bishop O<U+2019>Keefe<U+2019>s resignation and he was named Bishop Emeritus of Davenport.  He retired to an apartment that was created for him on the grounds of St. Vincent Center.  He died of a [[heart attack]] on April 12, 2000 after having celebrated the [[Chrism Mass]] with the clergy and people of the diocese.  He was buried during [[Holy Week]] in the Bishop's Circle in [[Mount Calvary Cemetery (Davenport, Iowa)|Mt. Calvary Cemetery]] in Davenport.

The library at St. Ambrose University in Davenport was named in O'Keefe's honor.  However, at the request of a victim of sexual abuse, unrelated to the St. Paul incident, his name was removed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qctimes.com/news/local/article_575a5fe0-7cf7-5981-9fc6-5937e4bc28be.html|title=Ambrose to remove former Bishop O'Keefe's name from the library
