'''Sumerian''' ({{lang|sux|<U+00012174><U+000120A0>}} {{transl|sux|EME.<U+011C>IR<sub>15</sub>}} "[[exonym and endonym|native tongue]]") is the language of ancient [[Sumer]], which was spoken in southern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) from at least the 4th millennium BC. During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name=deutscher2007/> The influence of Sumerian on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name=deutscher2007/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a ''[[Sprachbund]]'' (area of linguistic convergence).<ref name=deutscher2007/>

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language around 2000 BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name=woods/> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.<ref name=oates79/><ref name=grayson80/> Then, it was forgotten until the 19th century, when [[Assyriologists]] began [[Decipherment|deciphering]] the [[cuneiform]] inscriptions and excavated tablets left by these speakers. Sumerian is a [[language isolate]].<ref name=britanica/><ref>[http://www.news.leiden.edu/news/our-sixty-minute-hour-comes-from-sumerian.html Our sixty-minute hour comes from Sumerian-universiteit leiden]</ref><ref>[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sumerian.htm Sumerian-omniglot]</ref>

==Varieties==
===Stages===
The history of written Sumerian can be divided into several periods:
*Archaic Sumerian <U+2014> 31st<U+2013>26th century BC,
*Old or Classical Sumerian <U+2014> 26th<U+2013>23rd century. BC,
*Neo-Sumerian <U+2014> 23rd<U+2013>21st century BC,
*Late Sumerian <U+2014> 20th<U+2013>18th century BC,
*Post-Sumerian <U+2014> after 1700 BC.

[[File:Sumerian - Protoliterate Tablet - Walters 41219 - View A.jpg|thumb|This proto-literate tablet records more than just the transfer of land - the beginning of the transition from a pictograph to phonetic writing system can be seen here. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]]. ca. 3100 - 2900 BC.]]

Archaic Sumerian is the earliest stage of inscriptions with linguistic content, beginning with the [[Jemdet Nasr period|Jemdet Nasr]] (Uruk III) period from about the 31st to 30th centuries BC. It succeeds the [[Cuneiform script#Proto-literate period|proto-literate period]], which spans roughly the 35th to 30th centuries.

Some versions of the chronology may omit the Late Sumerian phase and regard all texts written after 2000 BC as Post-Sumerian.<ref>[http://history-world.org/sumerian_language.htm Sumerian Language]</ref> The term "Post-Sumerian" is meant to refer to the time when the language was already extinct and only preserved by [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyria]]ns as a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and [[classical language]] (for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes). The extinction has been traditionally dated approximately to the end of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], the last predominantly Sumerian state in Mesopotamia, about 2000 BC. However, this date is very approximate, as many scholars have contended that Sumerian was already dead or dying as early as around 2100 BC, by the beginning of the Ur III period,<ref name=woods/><ref name=michal06/> while others believe that Sumerian persisted as a spoken language in a small part of Southern Mesopotamia ([[Nippur]] and its surroundings) until as late as 1700 BC.<ref name=woods/> Whatever the status of spoken Sumerian between 2000 and 1700 BC, it is from this period that a particularly large amount of literary texts and bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian [[lexical lists]] survive, especially from the scribal school of Nippur. This, along with the particularly intensive official and literary use of the language in Akkadian-speaking states during the same time, is the basis for the distinction between a Late Sumerian period and all subsequent time.

===Dialects===
Two [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] ([[dialect]]s or [[sociolect]]s) of Sumerian are recorded. The standard variety is called ''eme-<U+011D>ir'' (''<U+011D>'' pronounced {{IPAblink|<U+014B>}}). The other recorded variety is called ''eme-sal'' ({{unicode|&#x12174;&#x122a9;}} EME.SAL, possibly "fine tongue" or "high-pitched voice".<ref>Rubio 2007. P.1369.</ref>), though often translated as "women's language". (The root ''sal'' can have several meanings.) ''Eme-sal'' is used exclusively by female characters in some literary texts. (This may be compared to the female languages or language varieties that exist or have existed in some cultures, e.g. among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]s and the [[Caribs]].) In addition, it is dominant in certain genres of cult songs. The special features of ''eme-sal'' are mostly phonological (e.g. ''m'' is often used instead of ''<U+011D>'' as in ''me'' vs standard ''<U+011D>e<sub>26</sub>'', "I"), but words different from the standard language are also used (e.g. ''ga-<U+0161>a-an'' vs standard ''nin'', "lady").

==Grammar overview==
Sumerian is an [[agglutinative language]], meaning that words could consist of a chain of more or less clearly distinguishable and separable [[affix]]es and/or [[morpheme]]s.

Sumerian is a [[split ergativity|split ergative]] language. It behaves as a [[nominative<U+2013>accusative language]] in the 1st and 2nd person of present-future tense/incompletive [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] ({{sc|aka}} ''mar<U+00FB>''-conjugation), but as [[ergative<U+2013>absolutive language|ergative<U+2013>absolutive]] in most other forms of the [[indicative mood]]. Similar patterns are found in a large number of unrelated split ergative languages (see more examples at [[split ergativity]]). In Sumerian the ergative case is marked by the suffix ''-e'' and the absolutive case (as in most ergative languages) by no suffix at all (the so-called "zero suffix"). Example of the ergative pattern: ''lugal-e e<sub>2</sub> mu-un-du<sub>3</sub>'' "the king built the house"; ''lugal ba-<U+011D>en'' "the king went" (the [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] subject is expressed differently from the [[intransitive]] subject, as it takes the suffix ''-e''). Example of the nominative<U+2013>accusative pattern: ''i<sub>3</sub>-du-un'' (< *i<sub>3</sub>-du-en) "I go (away)"; ''e<sub>2</sub> ib<sub>2</sub>-du<sub>3</sub>-un'' (< *ib<sub>2</sub>-du<sub>3</sub>-en) "I build the house" (the transitive subject is expressed in the same way as the intransitive subject, as both verbs take the same 1st person singular suffix ''-en'').

Sumerian distinguishes the [[grammatical genders]] [[Animacy|human/non-human]] (personal/impersonal), but it does not have separate male/female gender pronouns. The human gender includes not only humans but also gods and in some cases the word for "statue". Sumerian has also been claimed to have two tenses (past and present-future), but these are currently described as completive and incompletive or perfective and imperfective [[grammatical aspect|aspects]] instead. There are a large number of [[declension|cases]]: [[absolutive]] (-<U+00D8>), [[ergative case|ergative]] (''-e''), [[genitive]] (''-(a)k''), [[dative]]/[[allative]] ("to, for") (''-r(a)'' for human nouns, ''-e'' for non-human nouns), [[locative]] ("in, at") (''-a'', only with non-human nouns), [[comitative]] (''-da''), [[equative case|equative]] ("as, like") (''-gin''), [[directive case|directive]]/[[adverbial]] ("towards") (''-<U+0161>(e)''), [[ablative]] ("from") (''-ta'', only with non-human nouns). The naming and number of the cases varies in the scientific literature.

Another characteristic feature of Sumerian is the large number of [[homophone]]s (words with the same sound structure but different meanings), which are perhaps pseudo-homophones, as there might have been differences in pronunciation such as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] or some phonemic distinctions that are unknown. The different homophones (or, more precisely, the different cuneiform signs that denote them) are marked with different numbers by convention, "<sub>2</sub>" and "<sub>3</sub>" being often replaced by [[acute accent]] and [[grave accent]] [[diacritic]]s respectively. For example: ''du'' = "go", ''du<sub>3</sub>'' = ''d<U+00F9>'' = "build".

The standard modern grammar of Sumerian is that of [[Dietz-Otto Edzard]] (2003).

==Classification==
Sumerian is a [[language isolate]]. Ever since decipherment, it has been the subject of much effort to relate it to a wide variety of languages. Because it has a peculiar prestige as the most ancient written language, proposals for linguistic affinity sometimes have a nationalistic background. Such proposals enjoy virtually no support amongst linguists because of their unverifiability.<ref name=michal04/>

Several linguistic problems arise in the attempt to relate Sumerian with known language families.  First, the amount of time between the earliest known form of Sumerian and the oldest reconstructable form of the proposed related language is too great to make reliable comparisons.  Another problem difficult to overcome is that the phonetic and semantic change to vocabulary that can occur over long periods of time can make a language unrecognizable from its ancestor. Words in two languages that may sound alike today are more likely to be unrelated than related.<ref name=Edzard/>

A few examples of proposed linguistic affiliations include:

*[[Hurro-Urartian languages]] (see [[Subarian]], [[Alarodian]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}})

==Writing system==
{{Main|Sumerian cuneiform}}

===Development===
[[Image:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu|Telloh]] (ancient Girsu)]]
The Sumerian language is the earliest known written language. The "proto-literate" period of Sumerian writing spans c. 3500 to 3000 BC. In this period, records are purely logographic, with no linguistic or phonological content. The oldest document of the proto-literate period is the [[Kish tablet]]. [[Adam Falkenstein|Falkenstein]] (1936) lists 939 signs used in the proto-literate period ([[Uruk period|late Uruk]], 34th to 31st centuries)

Records with unambiguously linguistic content, identifiably Sumerian, are those found at [[Jemdet Nasr]], dating to the 31st or 30th century BC. From about 2600 BC, the logographic symbols were   generalized using a wedge-shaped stylus to impress the shapes into wet clay. This archaic ''cuneiform'' ("wedge-shaped") mode of writing co-existed with the pre-cuneiform archaic mode. Deimel (1922) lists 870 signs used in the Early Dynastic IIIa  period (26th century). In the same period the large set of logographic signs had been simplified into a [[logosyllabic#Logogrammatical systems|logosyllabic script]] comprising several hundred signs. Rosengarten (1967) lists 468 signs used in Sumerian (pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonian]]) [[Lagash]]. The pre-Sargonian period of the 26th to 24th centuries BC is the "Classical Sumerian" stage of the language.

The cuneiform script is adapted to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] writing from the mid 3rd millennium. Our knowledge of Sumerian is based on Akkadian glossaries. During the "[[Sumerian Renaissance]]" (Ur III) of the 21st century BC, Sumerian is written in already highly abstract cuneiform glyphs directly succeeded by [[Akkadian language|Old Assyrian]] cuneiform.

===Transcription===
Transcription, in the context of cuneiform, is the process in which an epigraphist makes a line art drawing to show the signs on a clay tablet or stone inscription in a graphic form suitable for modern publication. Not all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before a scholar publishes an important treatment of a text, the scholar will often arrange to collate the published transcription against the actual tablet, to see if any signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.

Transliteration is the process in which a Sumerologist decides how to represent the cuneiform signs in Roman script. Depending on the context, a cuneiform sign can be read either as one of several possible [[logograms]], each of which corresponds to a word in the Sumerian spoken language, as a phonetic syllable (V, VC, CV, or CVC), or as a [[determinative]] (a marker of semantic category, such as occupation or place). (See the article [[Transliterating cuneiform languages]]). Some Sumerian logograms were written with multiple cuneiform signs. These logograms are called diri-spellings, after the logogram 'diri' which is written with the signs SI and A. The text transliteration of a tablet will show just the logogram, such as the word 'diri', not the separate component signs.

==Historiography==
The key to reading [[logosyllabic]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] came from the [[Behistun inscription]], a trilingual cuneiform inscription written in [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].

In 1838 [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]], building on the 1802 work of [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]], was able to [[Decipherment|decipher]] the Old Persian section of the [[Behistun inscriptions]], using his knowledge of modern Persian. When he recovered the rest of the text in 1843, he and others were gradually able to translate the Elamite and Akkadian sections of it, starting with the 37 signs he had deciphered for the Old Persian. Meanwhile, many more cuneiform texts were coming to light from [[archaeological]] excavations, mostly in the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]], which were duly deciphered.

By 1850, however, [[Edward Hincks]] came to suspect a non-Semitic origin for cuneiform. Semitic languages are structured according to [[triconsonantal root|consonantal form]]s, whereas cuneiform, when functioning phonetically, was a [[syllabary]], binding consonants to particular vowels. Furthermore, no Semitic words could be found to explain the syllabic values given to particular signs.<ref>[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2011/cdlj2011_001.html] Kevin J. Cathcart, The Earliest Contributions to the Decipherment of Sumerian and Akkadian, Cuneiform Digital Library Journal, 2011</ref> [[Julius Oppert]] suggested that a non-Semitic language had preceded Akkadian in Mesopotamia, and that speakers of this language had developed the cuneiform script. 

In 1855 Rawlinson announced the discovery of non-Semitic inscriptions at the southern Babylonian sites of [[Nippur]], [[Larsa]], and [[Uruk]]. 

In 1856, Hincks argued that the untranslated language was [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] in character. The language was called "Scythic" by some, and, confusingly, "Akkadian" by others. In 1869, Oppert proposed the name "Sumerian", based on the known title "King of Sumer and Akkad", reasoning that if [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] signified the Semitic portion of the kingdom, [[Sumer]] might describe the non-Semitic annex.

Credit for being first to scientifically treat a bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian text belongs to [[Paul Haupt]], who published ''Die sumerischen Familiengesetze'' (The Sumerian family laws) in 1879.<ref>in ''Keilschrift, Transcription und <U+00DC>bersetzung : nebst ausf<U+00FC>hrlichem Commentar und zahlreichen Excursen : eine assyriologische Studie'' (Leipzig : J.C. Hinrichs, 1879)</ref>

[[Ernest de Sarzec]] began excavating the Sumerian site of [[Girsu|Tello]] (ancient Girsu, capital of the state of [[Lagash]]) in 1877, and published the first part of ''D<U+00E9>couvertes en Chald<U+00E9>e'' with transcriptions of Sumerian tablets in 1884. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] began excavating Sumerian [[Nippur]] in 1888.

''A Classified List of Sumerian Ideographs'' by R. Br<U+00FC>nnow appeared in 1889.

The bewildering number and variety of phonetic values that signs could have in Sumerian led to an unfortunate detour in understanding the language <U+2013> a [[Paris]]-based [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[Joseph Hal<U+00E9>vy]], argued from 1874 onward that Sumerian was not a natural language, but rather a [[secret code]] (a [[cryptolect]]), and for over a decade the leading Assyriologists battled over this issue. For a dozen years, starting in 1885, even the great [[Friedrich Delitzsch]] accepted Hal<U+00E9>vy's arguments, not renouncing Hal<U+00E9>vy until 1897.

Fran<U+00E7>ois Thureau-Dangin working at the Louvre in Paris also made significant contributions to deciphering Sumerian with publications from 1898 to 1938, such as his 1905 publication of ''Les inscriptions de Sumer et d<U+2019>Akkad''. Charles Fossey at the Coll<U+00E8>ge de France in Paris was another prolific and reliable scholar.  His pioneering ''Contribution au Dictionnaire sum<U+00E9>rien<U+2013>assyrien'', Paris 1905<U+2013>1907, turns out to provide the foundation for P. Anton Deimel's 1934 ''Sumerisch-Akkadisches Glossar'' (vol. III of Deimel's 4-volume ''Sumerisches Lexikon'').

In 1908, [[Stephen Langdon]] summarized the rapid expansion in knowledge of Sumerian and Akkadian vocabulary in the pages of ''Babyloniaca'', a journal edited by [[Charles Virolleaud]], in an article [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;sid=925969e1cdb54224dccf86fdb4bdef76;rgn=full%20text;idno=ACG1616.0002.001;view=image;seq=00000217 'Sumerian-Assyrian Vocabularies'], which reviewed a valuable new book on rare logograms by Bruno Meissner. Subsequent scholars have found Langdon's work, including his tablet transcriptions, to be not entirely reliable.

In 1944, a more careful Sumerologist, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], provided a detailed and readable summary of the decipherment of Sumerian in his ''Sumerian Mythology'' (now [http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum05.htm accessible on the Internet]).

Friedrich Delitzsch published a learned Sumerian dictionary and grammar in the form of his ''Sumerisches Glossar'' and ''Grundz<U+00FC>ge der sumerischen Grammatik'', both appearing in 1914. Delitzsch's student, [[Arno Poebel]], published a grammar with the same title, ''Grundz<U+00FC>ge der sumerischen Grammatik'', in 1923, and for 50 years it would be the standard for students studying Sumerian. Poebel's grammar was finally superseded in 1984 on the publication of ''The Sumerian Language, An Introduction to its History and Grammatical Structure'', by [[Marie-Louise Thomsen]]. While much of Thomsen's understanding of Sumerian grammar would now be rejected by most or all Sumerologists, Thomsen's grammar (often with express mention of the critiques put forward by Pascal Attinger in his 1993 ''El<U+00E9>ments de linguistique sum<U+00E9>rienne: La construction de du11/e/di <U+00AB>dire<U+00BB>'') is the starting point of most recent academic discussions of Sumerian grammar.

More recent monograph-length grammars of Sumerian include Dietz Otto Edzard's 2003 ''Sumerian Grammar'' and Bram Jagersma's 2010 ''A Descriptive Grammar of Sumerian'' (currently digital, but soon to be printed in revised form by Oxford University Press). Piotr Michalowski's essay (entitled, simply, "Sumerian") in the 2004 ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages'' has also been recognized as a good modern grammatical sketch.

There is relatively little consensus, even among reasonable Sumerologists, in comparison to the state of most modern or classical languages. Verbal morphology in particular is hotly disputed. In addition to the general grammars, there are many monographs and articles about particular areas of Sumerian grammar, without which a survey of the field could not be considered complete.

The primary institutional lexical effort in Sumerian is the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary project, begun in 1974. In 2004, the PSD was released on the Web as the ePSD. The project is currently supervised by Steve Tinney. It has not been updated on-line since 2006, but Tinney and colleagues are working on a new edition of the ePSD, a working draft of which is available on-line.

==Phonology and grammar==
[[Linguistic typology|Typologically]], as mentioned above, Sumerian is classified as an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[split ergativity|split ergative]] language. Ever since its decipherment, the research of Sumerian has been made difficult not only by the lack of any native speakers, but also by the relative sparseness of linguistic data, the apparent lack of a closely related language, and the features of the writing system.

''Note: in the following, assumed phonological or morphological forms are presented between slashes //, while plain text is used for the standard Assyriological transcription of Sumerian. Most of the examples are unattested.''

===Phonemic inventory===
Modern knowledge of Sumerian phonology is inevitably extremely flawed and incomplete because of the lack of native speakers, the transmission through the filter of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] phonology and the difficulties posed by the  cuneiform script. As [[I.M. Diakonoff]] observes, "when we try to find out  the morphophonological structure of the Sumerian language, we must  constantly bear in mind that we are not dealing with a language directly but are reconstructing it from a very imperfect mnemonic writing system which had not been basically aimed at the rendering of morphophonemics."

====Consonants====
Sumerian is conjectured to have at least the following consonants:

*a simple distribution of six [[stop consonant]]s, in three [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] distinguished by a feature which may have been [[voiced consonant|voicing]] (at least at later stages),  [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] or [[ejectives|glottalization]] (at least  at early stages):
*#p ([[voiceless bilabial plosive]]),
*#t ([[voiceless alveolar plosive]]),
*#k ([[voiceless velar plosive]]),
*#b ([[voiced bilabial plosive]]),
*#d ([[voiced alveolar plosive]]),

*a [[phoneme]] usually represented by /r<U+0302>/ (sometimes written ''dr'') that  was possibly an [[alveolar tap]], though some have argued for an aspirated  [[affricate]].

*#n ([[alveolar nasal]]),
*#g<U+0303> (frequently printed <U+011D> due to typesetting constraints, increasingly transcribed as <U+014B>) {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}} (likely a [[velar nasal]], as in ''si'''ng''''', it has also been argued to be a [[Labialization|labiovelar]] nasal or a [[nasalization|nasalized]]  [[Labial<U+2013>velar consonant|labiovelar]]<ref name=michal08/>).
*a set of three [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]]:
*#s (possibly a [[voiceless alveolar fricative]]),
*#z (possibly a [[voiced alveolar fricative]], {{IPA|/z/}}, as in  '''''z'''ip'')<ref>{{cite web |author=D. Foxvog |url=http://home.comcast.net/~foxvog/Grammar.pdf |title=Introduction to Sumerian grammar |page=21 |accessdate=15 March 2009}}</ref>
*#<U+0161> (generally described as a [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]],  {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}}, as in '''''sh'''ip''),

*a [[velar consonant|velar]] [[fricative consonant|fricative]] /[[<U+1E2B>]]/  (sometimes just written h).
*two [[liquid consonant]]s:
*#l (a [[lateral consonant]]),
*#r (a [[rhotic consonant]]).

The existence of various other consonants has been hypothesized based on  graphic alternations and loans, though none have found wide acceptance. For example, [[Igor Diakonoff|Diakonoff]] lists evidence for  two l-sounds, two r-sounds, two h-sounds, and two g-sounds (excluding the  velar nasal), and assumes a phonemic difference between consonants that are  dropped word-finally (such as the ''g'' in zag > za3) and consonants that  aren't (such as the ''g'' in lag). Other "hidden" consonant phonemes that have been suggested include semivowels such as {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}},<ref name=etcsl2005/> and a [[voiceless glottal fricative|glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/h/}} or a [[glottal stop]] that could explain the absence  of [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in some words<ref>Attinger,  Pascal, 1993. ''El<U+00E9>ments de linguistique sum<U+00E9>rienne''. p. 212  [http://web.archive.org/web/20110103084319/http://doc.rero.ch/lm.php?url=1000,40,4,20080304131832-QE/th_AttingerP.pdf] ([http://www.webcitation.org/6HAwliaIc Archive])</ref><U+2014>though objections have been raised against that as well.<ref>[Keetman, J. 2007. "Gab es ein ''h'' im Sumerischen?" In: ''Babel und Bibel'' 3, ''passim'']</ref>

Very often, a word-final consonant was not expressed in writing <U+2013> and was possibly omitted in pronunciation <U+2013> so it surfaced only when followed by a vowel: for example the /k/ of the [[genitive case]] ending -ak does not appear in  e<sub>2</sub> lugal-la "the king's house", but becomes obvious in  e<sub>2</sub> lugal-la-kam "(it) is the king's house" (compare [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] in French).

====Vowels====
The vowels that are clearly distinguished by the cuneiform script are /a/, /e/, /i/, and /u/.  It has also been argued that an /o/ phoneme might have existed, a fact that would have been concealed by the Akkadian  transliteration which does not distinguish it from /u/. However, this  hypothesis has not found wide support.<ref name=michal08/>

There is some evidence for [[vowel harmony]] according to [[vowel height]] or [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] in the prefix i<sub>3</sub>/e- in  inscriptions from pre-[[Sargon the Great|Sargonic]] [[Lagash]] (the  specifics of the pattern have led a handful of scholars to postulate not  only an ''/o/'' phoneme, but even an {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} and, most recently, an {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}}<ref>Smith, Eric J M. 2007. [-ATR] "Harmony and the Vowel Inventory of Sumerian". ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'', volume 57</ref>) Many  cases of partial or complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable  are reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable though not absolute tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables.<ref name=michal08p17/> What appears to be [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ > a, */ae/ > a, */ue/ > u, etc.) is also very common.

Syllables could have any of the following structures: V, CV, VC, CVC. More complex syllables, if Sumerian had them, are not expressed as such by the cuneiform script.

===Grammar===
====Nominal morphology====
The Sumerian [[noun]] is typically a one or two syllable root (''igi'' "eye", ''e<sub>2</sub>'' "house, household", ''nin'' "lady"), although there are also some roots with three syllables like ''<U+0161>akanka'' "market". There are two [[grammatical gender]]s, usually called [[animacy|human and non-human]] (the first includes gods and the word for "statue" in some instances, but not plants or animals, the latter also includes collective plural nouns), whose assignment is semantically predictable. The [[adjective]]s and other [[modifiers]] follow the noun (''lugal ma<U+1E2B>'' "great king"). The noun itself is not inflected; rather, grammatical markers attach to the [[noun phrase]] as a whole, in a certain order. Typically, that order would be '''noun''' <U+2013> '''adjective''' <U+2013> '''numeral''' <U+2013> '''genitive phrase''' <U+2013> '''relative clause''' <U+2013> '''possessive marker''' <U+2013> '''plural marker''' <U+2013> '''case marker''', for example /di<U+011D>ir gal-gal-<U+011D>u-ne-ra/ ("god great ([[Reduplication|reduplicated]])-my-plural-dative" = "for all my great gods").<ref>[http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/kausen/wordtexte/Sumerisch.doc Kausen, Ernst.  2006. ''Sumerische Sprache''. p.9]</ref> The possessive, plural and case markers are traditionally referred to as "[[suffixes]]", but have recently also been described as [[enclitic]]s<ref>Z<U+00F3>lyomi, G<U+00E1>bor, 1993: ''Voice and Topicalization in Sumerian''. PhD Dissertation [http://www.assziriologia.hu/downloads/gzolyomiphd.pdf]</ref> or [[postpositions]].<ref name=johnson>Johnson, Cale, 2004: ''In the Eye of the Beholder:  Quantificational, Pragmatic and Aspectual Features of the *b<U+00ED>- Verbal Formation in Sumerian'', Dissertation. UCLA, Los Angeles [http://cdli.ucla.edu/staff/johnson/Johnson_diss_2004.pdf]</ref>

The plural markers are /-(e)ne/ (optional) for nouns of the human gender. Non-human nouns are not marked by a plural suffix. However, plurality can also be expressed with the adjective ''<U+1E2B>i-a'' "various", with the plural of the copula /-me<U+0161>/, by reduplication of the noun (''kur-kur''  "all foreign lands") or of the following adjective (''a gal-gal'' "all the great waters") <U+2013> the reduplication is believed to signify totality <U+2013> or by the plurality of the verb form only. Plural reference in the verb form is only possible for human nouns. The case markers are /-<U+00D8>/ ([[absolutive case|absolutive]]), /-e/ ([[ergative case|ergative]]), /-e/ ([[allative case|allative]] = "to"), /-ak/ ([[genitive case|genitive]]), /-gin/ ([[Equative case|equative]] = "as, like"), /-r(a)/ ([[dative case|dative]] = "to, for" = indirect object), /-(e)<U+0161>(e)/  (traditionally called [[terminative case]], but means "towards"), /-da/ ([[comitative case|comitative]] = "together with"), /-a/ ([[locative case|locative]] = "in, at"), /-ta/  ([[ablative case|ablative]] = "from, by"). Additional spatial or temporal meanings can be expressed by genitive phrases like "at the head of" = "above", "at the face of" = "in front of", "at the outer side of" = "because of" etc.: ''bar udu <U+1E2B>ad<sub>2</sub>-ak-a'' = "outer.side sheep white-genitive-locative" = "in the outer side of a white sheep" = "because of a white sheep".

The attested independent [[personal pronoun]]s are written ''<U+011D>e<sub>26</sub>-e''  (1st p. sing.), ''ze<sub>2</sub>-e'' (2nd p. sing.), ''a-ne'' or ''e-ne'' (3rd p. sing. human), and  ''a/e-ne-ne'' (3rd p. pl. human). The possessive pronominal morphemes are  written ''-<U+011D>u<sub>10</sub>'' (1st p. sing.), ''-zu'' (2nd p. sing.), ''-(a)-n(i)'' (3rd p.  sing. human), ''-b(i)'' (3rd p. sing./pl. non-human, also demonstrative and collective), ''-me'' (1st pers. pl.), ''-zu-ne-ne'' (2nd p. pl.), and ''-(a)-ne-ne'' (3rd pers.pl. animate). For most of the suffixes, vowels are subject to loss if they are attached to vowel-final words.

The [[Chinese boxes|Chinese box]] structure of the noun phrase can be illustrated with the  phrase ''sipad udu siki-k-ak-ene'' ("the shepherds of wool sheep"), where the first genitive morpheme subordinates ''siki'' "wool" to ''udu'' "sheep", and the second <U+2013> ''udu siki'' "wool sheep" to ''sipad'' "shepherd".

====Verbal morphology====
=====General=====
The Sumerian [[finite verb]] distinguishes a number of '''[[grammatical mood|moods]]''' and '''[[agreement (grammar)|agree]]s''' (more or less consistently) with the subject and the object in person, number and gender. The verb chain may also incorporate pronominal references to the verb's other modifiers, which has also traditionally been described as "agreement", although, in fact, such a reference ''and'' the presence of an actual modifier in the clause need not co-occur: not only '''e<sub>2</sub>-<U+0161>e'''<sub>3</sub> i'''b<sub>2</sub>-<U+0161>i'''-du-un "I'm going to the house", but also '''e<sub>2</sub>-<U+0161>e'''<sub>3</sub> i<sub>3</sub>-du-un "I'm going to the house" and simply i'''b<sub>2</sub>-<U+0161>i'''-du-un "I'm going to it" are possible.<ref name="johnson"/>

The Sumerian verb also makes a binary distinction according to a category that some regard as tense (past vs present-future), others as [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (perfective vs imperfective), and that will be designated as '''TA''' (tense/aspect) in the following. The two members of the opposition entail different conjugation patterns and, at least for many verbs, different stems; they are theory-neutrally referred to with the [[Akkadians|Akkadian]] grammatical terms for the two respective forms <U+2013> ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' (quick) and ''mar<U+00FB>'' (slow, fat). Finally, opinions differ on whether the verb has a [[passive voice|passive]] or a [[middle voice]] and how it is expressed.

The verbal root is almost always a monosyllable and, together with various [[affix]]es, forms a so-called verbal chain which is described as a sequence of about 15 slots, though the precise models differ.<ref>See e.g. Rubio 2007, Attinger 1993, Z<U+00F3>lyomi 2005 ("Sumerisch". In: ''Sprachen des Alten Orients'', ed. M. Streck), [http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/ppcs/MorphologyTable.html  PPCS Morphological model]</ref> The [[finite verb]] has both [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es, while the [[non-finite verb]] may only have suffixes. Broadly, the prefixes have been divided in three groups that occur in the following order: '''modal prefixes''', "'''conjugation prefixes'''", and '''pronominal and dimensional''' prefixes.<ref>E.g. Attinger 1993, Rubio 2007</ref> The suffixes are a future or imperfective marker /-ed-/, pronominal suffixes, and an /-a/ ending that nominalizes the whole verb chain.

=====Modal prefixes=====
The '''modal prefixes''' are /<U+00D8>-/ ([[indicative mood|indicative]]), /nu-/ and /la-/, /li-/ ([[negative mood|negative]]; /la/ and /li/ are used before the conjugation prefixes ba- and bi<sub>2</sub>-) /ga-/ ([[cohortative mood|cohortative]], "let me/us"), /<U+1E2B>a-/ or /<U+1E2B>e-/ with further assimilation of the vowel in later periods ([[irrealis mood#Precative|precative]] or affirmative), /u-/ ([[prospective aspect|prospective]] "after/when/if", also used as a mild imperative), /na-/ (negative or affirmative), /bara-/ (negative or vetitive), /nu<U+0161>-/ (unrealizable wish?) and /<U+0161>a-/ with further assimilation of the vowel in later periods (affirmative?). Their meaning can depend on the TA.

====="Conjugation prefixes"=====
The meaning, structure, identity and even the number of "'''conjugation prefixes'''" have always been a subject of disagreements. The term "conjugation prefix" simply alludes to the fact that a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]] must always contain one of them. Some of their most frequent expressions in writing are mu-, i<sub>3</sub>- ([[History of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|ED]] [[Lagash]] variant: e-), ba-, bi<sub>2</sub>- (ED Lagash: bi- or be<sub>2</sub>), im-, im-ma- (ED Lagash e-ma-), im-mi- (ED Lagash i<sub>3</sub>-mi or e-me-), mi-(always followed by pronominal-dimensional -ni-) and al-, and to a lesser extent a-, am<sub>3</sub>-, am<sub>3</sub>-ma-, and am<sub>3</sub>-mi-; virtually all analyses attempt to describe many of the above as combinations or allomorphs of each other. The starting point of most analyses are the obvious facts that the 1st person dative always requires mu-, and that the verb in a "passive" clause without an overt [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] tends to have ba-. Proposed explanations  usually revolve around the subtleties of spatial grammar, information structure ([[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]<ref>Rubio 2007 and references therein</ref>), [[verb valency]], and, most recently, [[grammatical voice|voice]].<ref>Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993; Also Woods, Cristopher, 2008: ''The Grammar of Perspective: The Sumerian Conjugation Prefixes as a System of Voice''</ref> Mu-, im- and am<sub>3</sub>- have been described as [[ventive]] morphemes, while ba- and bi<sub>2</sub>- are sometimes analyzed as actually belonging to the pronominal-dimensional group (inanimate pronominal /-b-/ + dative /-a-/ or directive /-i-/).<ref name="E.g. Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993">E.g. Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993</ref> Im-ma-, im-mi-, am<sub>3</sub>-ma- and am<sub>3</sub>-mi- are then considered by some as a combination of the ventive and /ba-/, /bi-/<ref name="E.g. Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993"/> or otherwise a variety of the ventive<ref name="Rubio 2007">Rubio 2007</ref> i<sub>3</sub>- has been argued to be a mere [[prothetic]] vowel, al- a [[stative verb|stative]] prefix, ba- a [[middle voice]] prefix, etcetera.

=====Pronominal and dimensional prefixes=====
The '''dimensional prefixes''' of the verb chain basically correspond to, and often repeat, the case markers of the noun phrase. Like the latter, they are attached to a "head" <U+2013> a '''pronominal prefix'''. The other place where a pronominal prefix can be placed is immediately before the stem, where it can have a different allomorph and expresses the absolutive or the ergative participant (the transitive subject, the intransitive subject or the direct object), depending on the TA and other factors, as explained below. However, this neat system is obscured by the tendency to drop or merge many of the prefixes in writing and possibly in pronunciation as well. -da-, -ta-, -<U+0161>i- (early -<U+0161>e<sub>3</sub>-), occurring in this order, are the comitative, ablative and terminative verbal prefixes; the dative (occurring before the others) is probably /-a-/, and a directive /-i-/ (occurring after the others) is widely recognized as well. The pronominal prefixes are /-n-/ and /-b-/ for the 3rd person singular animate and inanimate respectively; the 2nd person singular appears as -e- in most contexts, but as /-r-/ before the dative (-ra-), leading some<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi 2005">Z<U+00F3>lyomi 2005</ref> to assume a phonetic /-ir-/ or /-jr-/. The 1st person may appear as -e-, too, but is more commonly not expressed at all (the same may frequently apply to 3rd and 2nd persons); it is, however, cued by the choice of mu- as conjugation prefix<ref name="Rubio 2007"/> (/mu-/ + /-a-/ >> ma-). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd plural infixes are -me-,-re?- and -ne- in the dative<ref name="Rubio 2007"/> and perhaps in other contexts as well,<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi 2005"/> though not in the pre-stem position (see below). An additional exception from the system is the prefix -ni- which corresponds to a noun phrase in the locative <U+2013> in which case it doesn't seem to be preceded by a pronominal prefix <U+2013> and, according to G<U+00E1>bor Z<U+00F3>lyomi and others, to an animate one in the directive <U+2013> in the latter case it is analyzed as pronominal /-n-/ + directive /-i-/. Z<U+00F3>lyomi and others also believe that special meanings can be expressed by combinations of non-identical noun case and verb prefix.<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi2000">{{cite journal |last=Z<U+00F3>lyomi |year=2000 |title=Structural interference from Akkadian in Old Babylonian Sumerian |journal=Acta Sumerologica |volume=22 |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.assziriologia.hu/downloads/gz_structural_interference.pdf }}</ref> Also according to some researchers<ref>Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993, Attinger 1993</ref> /-ni-/ and /bi-/ acquire the forms /-n-/ and /-b-/ (coinciding with the ''absolutive<U+2013>ergative'' pronominal prefixes) before the stem if there isn't already an absolutive<U+2013>ergative pronominal prefix in pre-stem position: mu-un-kur<sub>9</sub> = /mu-ni-kur/ "he went in there" (as opposed to mu-ni-kur<sub>9</sub> = mu-ni-in-kur<sub>9</sub> = /mu-ni-n-kur/ "he brought in <U+2013> caused [something or someone] to go in <U+2013> there".

=====Pronominal suffixes and conjugation=====
The '''pronominal suffixes''' are /-en/ for the first- and second-person singular, /-e/ for the third singular in ''mar<U+00FB>'' TA and /-<U+00D8>/ in ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' TA, /-enden/ for the first plural, /-enzen/ for the second plural, /-ene/ for the third plural in ''mar<U+00FB>'' and /-e<U+0161>/ in ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' (the initial vowel in all of the above suffixes can be assimilated to the root). The general principle for '''pronominal agreement in conjugation''' is that in ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the ''mar<U+00FB>'' TA it is the other way round; as for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes and is thus treated like the object in ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' and like the subject in ''mar<U+00FB>'' (except that its third person is expressed, not only in ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' but also in ''mar<U+00FB>'', by the suffixes used for the ''object'' in the ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' TA). A major exception from this generalization are the plural forms <U+2013> in them, not only the prefix (as in the singular), but also the suffix expresses the transitive subject. Additionally, the prefixes of the plural are identical to those of the singular <U+2013> /-?-/ or /-e-/, /-e-/, /-n-/, /-b-/ <U+2013> as opposed to the -me-, -re-?, -ne- that are presumed for non-pre-stem position <U+2013> and some scholars believe that the prefixes of the 1st and second person are /-en-/ rather than /-e-/ when they stand for the object.<ref>Attinger 1993, Khachikyan 2007: ("Towards the Aspect System in Sumerian". In: ''Babel und Bibel'' 3.)</ref> Before the pronominal suffixes, a suffix /-e(d)-/ with a [[future tense|future]] or related modal meaning can be inserted, accounting for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular ''mar<U+00FB>'' of intransitive forms; because of its meaning, it can also be said to signal ''mar<U+00FB>'' in these forms.<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi 2005"/>

Examples for TA and pronominal agreement: (''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' is rendered with past tense, ''mar<U+00FB>'' with present): /i-gub-en/ ("I stood" or "I stand"), /i-n-gub-en/ ("he placed me" or "I place him"); /i-sug-enden/ ("we stood/stand"); /i-n-dim-enden/ ("he created us" or "we create him"); /mu-e?-dim-enden/ ("we created [someone or something]"); i<sub>3</sub>-gub-be<sub>2</sub> = /i-gub-ed/ ("he will/must stand"); ib<sub>2</sub>-gub-be<sub>2</sub> = /i-b-gub-e/ ("he places it"); /i-b-dim-ene/ ("they create it"), /i-n-dim-e<U+0161>/ ("they created [someone or something]" or "he created them"), /i-sug-e<U+0161>/ ("they stood" or "they stand").

Confusingly, the subject and object prefixes (/-n-/, /-b-/, /-e-/) are not commonly spelled out in early texts, although the "full" spellings do become more usual during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] (in the Neo-Sumerian period) and especially during the Late Sumerian period. Thus, in earlier texts, one finds mu-ak and i<sub>3</sub>-ak (e-ak in early dynastic Lagash) instead of mu-un-ak and in-ak for /mu-n-ak/ and /i-n-ak/ "he/she made", and also mu-ak instead of mu-e-ak "you made". Similarly, pre-Ur III texts also spell the first- and second-person suffix /-en/ as -e, making it coincide with the third person in the ''mar<U+00FB>'' form.

=====Stem=====
The verbal '''stem''' itself can also express grammatical distinctions. The plurality of the absolutive participant<ref name="Rubio 2007"/> can be expressed by complete reduplication of the stem or by a [[suppletive]] stem. Reduplication can also express "plurality of the action itself",<ref name="Rubio 2007"/> intensity or [[iterative|iterativity]].<ref name="etcsl2005" /> With respect to TA marking, verbs are divided in 4 types; ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' is always the unmarked TA. The stems of the 1st type, regular verbs, do not express TA at all according to most scholars, or, according to M. Yoshikawa and others, express ''mar<U+00FB>'' TA by adding an (assimilating) /-e-/ as in gub-be<sub>2</sub> or gub-bu vs gub (which is, however, nowhere distinguishable from the first vowel of the pronominal suffixes except for intransitive ''mar<U+00FB>'' 3rd person singular). The 2nd type express ''mar<U+00FB>'' by partial reduplication of the stem as kur<sub>9</sub> vs ku<sub>4</sub>-ku<sub>4</sub>; the 3rd type express ''mar<U+00FB>'' by adding a consonant (te vs te<U+011D><sub>3</sub>); and the 4th type use a suppletive stem (dug<sub>4</sub> vs e). Thus, as many as four different suppletive stems can exist, as in the admittedly extreme case of the verb "to go": <U+011D>en ("to go", ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' sing.), du (''mar<U+00FB>'' sing.), (e-)re<sub>7</sub> (''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' plur.), sub<sub>2</sub> (''mar<U+00FB>'' plur.)

=====Other issues=====
The  '''nominalizing suffix''' /-a/ converts non-finite and finite verbs into participles and relative clauses: sum-ma "given", mu-na-an-sum-ma "which he gave to him", "who gave (something) to him", etc.. Adding /-a/ after the future/modal suffix /-ed/ produces a form with a meaning similar to the [[gerundive#In Latin|Latin gerundive]]: sum-mu-da = "which will/should be given". On the other hand, adding a (locative-terminative?) /-e/ after the /-ed/ yields a form with a meaning similar to the [[Latin conjugation#The gerund|Latin ''ad'' + gerund (acc.) construction]]: sum-mu-de<sub>3</sub> = "(in order) to give".

The [[copula verb]] /me/ "to be" is mostly used as an enclitic: -men, -men, -am, -menden, -menzen,  -(a)me<U+0161>.

The '''[[imperative mood]]''' construction is produced with a singular ''<U+1E2B>am<U+1E6D>u'' stem, but using the ''mar<U+00FB>'' agreement pattern, by turning all prefixes into suffixes: mu-na-an-sum "he gave (something) to him", mu-na-e-sum-mu-un-ze<sub>2</sub>-en "you (plur.) gave (something) to him" <U+2013> sum-mu-na-ab "give it to him!", sum-mu-na-ab-ze<sub>2</sub>-en "give (plur.) it to him!" Compare the French ''tu le lui donnes'', ''vous le lui donnez'' (present tense) <U+2013> ''donne-le-lui!'', ''donnez-le-lui!''<ref name="Rubio 2007"/>

====Syntax====
The basic word order is [[subject<U+2013>object<U+2013>verb]]; verb finality is only violated in rare instances, in poetry. The moving of constituent towards the beginning of the phrase may be a way to highlight it,<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993">Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993</ref> as may the addition of the copula to it. The so-called anticipatory genitive (e<sub>2</sub>-a lugal-bi "the owner of the house/temple", lit. "of the house, its owner") is common and may signal the possessor's [[topic (linguistics)|topicality]].<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi 1993"/> There are various ways to express [[subordinate clause|subordination]], some of which have already been hinted at; they include [[Sumerian language#Other issues|the nominalization of a verb]], which can then be followed by case morphemes and possessive pronouns (kur9-ra-ni "when he entered") and included in [[Sumerian language#Nominal morphology|"prepositional" constructions]] (e<U+011D>er a-ma-ru ba-ur<sub>3</sub>-ra-ta "back <U+2013> flood <U+2013> conjugation prefix <U+2013> sweep over <U+2013> nominalizing suffix <U+2013> [genitive suffix?] <U+2013> ablative suffix" = "from the back of the Flood's sweeping-over" = "after the [[Deluge (mythology)|Flood]] had swept over"). [[Subordinating conjunction]]s such as ud-da "when, if", tukum-bi "if" are also used, though the [[coordinating conjunction]] u<sub>3</sub> "and", a Semitic adoption, is rarely used. A specific problem of Sumerian syntax is posed by the numerous so-called [[compound verb]]s, which usually involve a noun immediately before the verb, forming a lexical or [[idiom]]atic unit<ref>Johnson 2004:22</ref> (e.g. <U+0161>u...ti, lit. "hand-approach" = "receive"; igi...du<sub>8</sub>, lit. "eye-open" = "see"). Some of them are claimed to have a special agreement pattern that they share with [[causative]] constructions: their logical object, like the causee, receives, in the verb, the directive infix, but in the noun, the dative suffix if animate and the directive if inanimate.<ref name="Z<U+00F3>lyomi2000" />

'''I.1-7:''' [[Enlil]], king of all the lands, father of all the gods, by his firm command, fixed the border between [[Ningirsu]] and [[Shara (god)|Shara]].<br>
'''8-12:''' [[Mesilim]], king of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], at the command of [[Ishtaran]], measured the field and set up  a (boundary-) stone there. <br>
'''13-17:''' Ush, ruler of [[Umma]], acted haughtily. <br>
'''18-19:''' He ripped out that (boundary-) stone <br>
'''20-21:''' and marched toward the plain of [[Lagash]]. <br>
'''22-27:''' Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, at his just command, made war with Umma. <br>
'''28-29:''' At Enlil's command, he threw his great battle net over it<br>
'''30-31:''' and heaped up burial mounds for it on the plain. <br>
'''32-42:''' [[Eannatum]], ruler of Lagash, uncle of [[Entemena]], ruler of Lagash, fixed the border with Enakale, ruler of Umma; <br>
'''II.1-3a:''' made the (boundary-)channel extend from the Nun canal to the Gu'edena;<br>
'''3b:''' left a 1,290 meter length of Ningirsu's field, toward the side of Umma<br>
'''3c:''' and established(?) it as an ownerless field.<br>
'''4-5:''' At that (boundary-)channel he inscribed (new boundary-)stones, <br>
'''6-8:''' and restored the (boundary-)stone of Mesilim. <br>
'''9-10:''' He did not cross into the plain of Umma. <br>
'''11-18:''' On the (boundary-)levee of Ningirsu <U+2013> the Namnundakigara <U+2013> he built a shrine of Enlil, a shrine of [[Ninhursag]], a shrine of Ningirsu, and a shrine of [[Utu]].
