The '''history of [[Russia]]''' begins with that of the [[East Slavs]], the [[ethnic group]] that eventually split into the [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]]. The first East Slavic state, [[Kievan Rus']], adopted [[Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 988,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|work=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium.<ref name = Curtis>[http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods], excerpted from Glenn E.

ISBN 0160612128.</ref> Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state, leaving a number of states competing for claims to be the heirs to its civilization and dominant position. 

After the 13th century, [[Moscow]] gradually came to dominate the former cultural center.<ref name = Curtis/> By the 18th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] had become the huge [[Russian Empire]], stretching from [[Poland]] eastward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Expansion in the western direction sharpened Russia's awareness of its backwardness and shattered the isolation in which the initial stages of expansion had occurred. Successive regimes of the 19th century responded to such pressures with a combination of halfhearted reform and repression. [[Russian serfdom]] was [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|abolished in 1861]], but its abolition was achieved on terms unfavorable to the [[peasant]]s and served to increase revolutionary pressures. Between the abolition of serfdom and the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914, the [[Stolypin reform]]s, the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|constitution of 1906]] and [[Duma|State Duma]] introduced notable changes in economy and politics of Russia,<ref>See Jacob Walkin, ''The Rise of Ddemocracy in Pre-Revolutionary Russia: Political and Social Institutions under the Last Three Czars'', Praeger, 1962.</ref> but the [[tsar]]s were still not willing to cede [[autocracy|autocratic]] rule, or share their power.<ref>[http://www.ciaonet.org/atlas/countries/ru_data_loc.html#a0 CIAO - Atlas - Russia]</ref>

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917 was triggered by a combination of economic breakdown, suffering in war, and discontent with autocracy, and it first brought a coalition of liberals and moderate socialists to power and then [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] [[Bolshevik]]s. Between 1922 and 1991, the history of Russia is essentially the [[history of the Soviet Union]], effectively an ideologically based empire which was roughly coterminous with the Russian Empire. The approach to the building of socialism, however, varied over different periods in Soviet history, from the mixed economy and diverse society and culture of the 1920s to the command economy and repressions of the [[Stalin]] era to the "era of stagnation" in the 1980s. From its first years, government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communists, as the Bolsheviks called themselves, beginning in March 1918.<ref name = Curtis3>[http://countrystudies.us/russia/8.htm Revolutions and Civil War], excerpted from Glenn E.

The [[History of post-Soviet Russia|history of the Russian Federation]] is brief, dating back only to the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991. Since gaining its independence, Russia was recognized as the legal successor to the Soviet Union on the international stage.<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029394365&a=KCountryProfile&aid=1019744935436 Country Profile for the Russian Federation], by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Retrieved 21 July 2007.</ref> However, Russia has lost its [[superpower]] status as it faced serious challenges in its efforts to forge a new post-Soviet political and economic system. Scrapping the socialist [[planned economy|central planning]] and state ownership of property of the Soviet era, Russia attempted to build an economy with elements of market [[capitalism]], with often painful results.<ref name = Filzer/> Even today Russia shares many continuities of political culture and social structure with its tsarist and Soviet past.

To the Orthodox Church and most princes, the fanatical [[Northern Crusades|Northern Crusaders]] seemed a greater threat to the Russian way of life than the Mongols. In the mid-13th century, [[Alexander Nevsky]], elected prince of Novgorod, acquired heroic status as the result of major victories over the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the [[Swedes]]. Alexander obtained Mongol protection and assistance in fighting invaders from the west who, hoping to profit from the Russian collapse since the Mongol invasions, tried to grab territory and convert the Russians into [[Roman Catholicism]].

[[Image:Moscow daniel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|During the reign of [[Daniel of Russia|Daniel]], [[Moscow]] was little more than a small timber fort lost in the forests of Central [[Russia]]]][[Daniil Aleksandrovich]], the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, founded the principality of Moscow (known in the western tradition as Muscovy),<ref name = Curtis2/> which eventually expelled the Tatars from Russia. Well-situated in the central river system of Russia and surrounded by protective forests and marshes, Moscow was at first only a [[vassal]] of Vladimir, but soon it absorbed its parent state. A major factor in the ascendancy of Moscow was the cooperation of its rulers with the Mongol overlords, who granted them the title of Grand Prince of Moscow and made them agents for collecting the Tatar tribute from the Russian principalities. The principality's prestige was further enhanced when it became the center of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Its head, the metropolitan, fled from Kiev to [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir]] in 1299 and a few years later established the permanent headquarters of the Church in Moscow.

By the middle of the 14th century, the power of the Mongols was declining, and the Grand Princes felt able to openly oppose the [[Mongol yoke]]. In 1380, at [[Kulikovo]] on the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]], the Mongols were defeated,<ref name = Kulikovo /> and although this hard-fought victory did not end Tatar rule of Russia, it did bring great fame to the Grand Prince. Moscow's leadership in Russia was now firmly based and by the middle of the fourteenth century its territory had greatly expanded through purchase, war, and marriage.

===Ivan III, the Great===
In the 15th century, the grand princes of Moscow went on gathering Russian lands to increase the population and wealth under their rule. The most successful practitioner of this process was [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], the Great (1462&ndash;1505),<ref name = Curtis2/> who laid the foundations for a Russian national state. Ivan competed with his powerful northwestern rival, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], for control over some of the semi-independent [[Upper Principalities]] in the upper Dnieper and [[Oka River]] basins.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Through the defections of some princes, border skirmishes, and a long war with the Novgorod Republic, Ivan III was able to annex Novgorod and Tver.<ref>Donald Ostrowski in ''The Cambridge History of Russia'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 234.

A contemporary of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s and other "new monarchs" in Western Europe, Ivan proclaimed his absolute sovereignty over all Russian princes and nobles. Refusing further tribute to the Tatars, Ivan initiated a series of attacks that opened the way for the complete defeat of the declining Golden Horde, now divided into several khanates and hordes. Ivan and his successors sought to protect the southern boundaries of their domain against attacks of the [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimean Tatars]] and other hordes. To achieve this aim, they sponsored the construction of the [[Great Abatis Belt]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}} and granted manors to nobles, who were obliged to serve in the military.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The manor system provided a basis for an emerging horse army.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} 

In this way, internal consolidation accompanied outward expansion of the state. By the 16th century, the rulers of Moscow considered the entire Russian territory their collective property. Various semi-independent princes still claimed specific territories,{{Fact|date=July 2007}} but Ivan III forced the lesser princes to acknowledge the grand prince of Moscow and his descendants as unquestioned rulers with control over military, judicial, and foreign affairs. Gradually, the Russian ruler emerged as a powerful, autocratic ruler, a tsar.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The first Russian ruler to officially crown himself "[[Tsar]]" was Ivan IV.<ref name = Curtis2/>

===The Romanovs===
{{Citations missing|section|date=July 2007}}
[[Image:Ryabushkin 17centMoscow.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A painting of a 17th century Moscow street holiday by [[Andrei Ryabushkin]]]]
The Time of Troubles was brought to an end in 1612, when a patriotic volunteer army expelled the Poles from the [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Zemsky Sobor|a national assembly]], composed of representatives from fifty cities and even some peasants, elected [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]], the young son of [[Patriarch Filaret]], to the throne. The [[Romanov]] dynasty ruled Russia until 1917.

The immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore peace. Fortunately for Moscow, its major enemies, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Sweden]], were engaged in a bitter conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617 and to sign a truce with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1619. Recovery of lost territories started in the mid-17th century, when the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Khmelnitsky Uprising]] of the [[Ukrainian Cossacks]] triggered a prolonged [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)|Russo-Polish War]]. The resultant [[Treaty of Andrusovo]] (1667) brought substantial gains, including [[Smolensk]], Kiev and the eastern half of [[Ukraine]].<ref name = Curtis2/>

Rather than risk their estates in more civil war, the great nobles or ''[[boyar]]s'' cooperated with the first Romanovs, enabling them to finish the work of bureaucratic centralization. Thus, the state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military. In return the tsars allowed the ''boyars'' to complete the process of enserfing the peasants.

In the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one landlord to another. With the state now fully sanctioning [[Russian serfdom|serfdom]], runaway peasants became state fugitives. Landlords had complete power over their peasants and could alienate and transfer them without the land to other landowners. Together the state and the nobles placed the overwhelming burden of taxation on the peasants, whose rate was 100 times greater in the mid-17th century than it had been a century earlier. In addition, middle-class urban tradesmen and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes.<ref>For a discussion of the development of the class structure in Tsarist Russia see [[Theda Skocpol|Skocpol, Theda]]. ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China''. Cambridge U Press, 1988.</ref>

Under such circumstances, peasant disorders were endemic; even the citizens of Moscow revolted against the Romanovs during the [[Salt Riot]] (1648),<ref name = Kotilaine>Jarmo Kotilaine and Marshall Poe, ''Modernizing Muscovy: Reform and Social Change in Seventeenth-Century Russia'', Routledge, 2004, p. 264.

As the free settlers of South Russia, the Cossacks, reacted against the growing centralization of the state, serfs escaped from their landlords and joined the rebels. The Cossack leader [[Stenka Razin]] led his followers up the Volga River, inciting peasant uprisings and replacing local governments with Cossack rule.<ref name = Curtis2/> The tsar's army finally crushed his forces in 1670; a year later Stenka was captured and beheaded. Yet, less than half a century later, the strains of military expeditions produced another [[Bulavin Rebellion|revolt in Astrakhan]], ultimately subdued.

===Peter the Great===
{{Citations missing|section|date=July 2007}}
[[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], the Great (1672&ndash;1725), consolidated autocracy in Russia and played a major role in bringing his country into the European state system. From its modest beginnings in the 14th century principality of Moscow, Russia had become the largest state in the world by Peter's time. Three times the size of continental Europe, it spanned the Eurasian landmass from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Pacific Ocean. Much of its expansion had taken place in the 17th century, culminating in the first Russian settlement of the Pacific in the mid-17th century, the reconquest of Kiev, and the pacification of the Siberian tribes. However, this vast land had a population of only 14 million. Grain yields trailed behind those of agriculture in the West, compelling almost the entire population to farm. Only a small fraction of the population lived in the towns.

Peter was deeply impressed by the advanced technology, warcraft, and statecraft of the West. He studied Western tactics and fortifications and built a strong army of 300,000 made up of his own subjects, whom he conscripted for life. In 1697<U+2013>1698, he [[Great Embassy|became the first Russian prince to ever visit the West]], where he and his entourage made a deep impression. In celebration of his conquests, Peter assumed the title of emperor as well as tsar, and Muscovite Russia officially became the [[Russian Empire]] in 1721.

Peter's first military efforts were directed against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].<ref>His aim was to establish a Russian foothold on the [[Black Sea]] by taking the town of [[Azov]]. See Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'', Perennial, 1979, p. 353. ISBN 0688030939.</ref> His attention then turned to the north. Peter still lacked a secure northern seaport except at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] on the [[White Sea]], whose harbor was frozen nine months a year. Access to the Baltic was blocked by [[Sweden]], whose territory enclosed it on three sides. Peter's ambitions for a "window to the sea" led him in 1699 to make a secret alliance with the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Denmark]] against Sweden,<ref>Robert I. Frost ''The Northern Wars: 1558-1721'' (Longman, 2000) p.228</ref> resulting in the [[Great Northern War]]. The war ended in 1721 when an exhausted Sweden sued for peace with Russia. Peter acquired four provinces situated south and east of the Gulf of Finland, thus securing his coveted access to the sea. <ref>Frost p.296</ref> There, in 1703, he had already founded the city that was to become Russia's new capital, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], as a "window opened upon Europe" to replace Moscow, long Russia's cultural center.<ref>Frost p.230</ref>

Peter reorganized his government on the latest Western models, molding Russia into an [[political absolutism|absolutist]] state. He replaced the old ''boyar'' [[Duma]] (council of nobles) with a nine-member senate, in effect a supreme council of state. The countryside was also divided into new provinces and districts. Peter told the senate that its mission was to collect tax revenues. In turn tax revenues tripled over the course of his reign. As part of the government reform, the Orthodox Church was partially incorporated into the country's administrative structure, in effect making it a tool of the state. Peter abolished the patriarchate and replaced it with a collective body, the [[Holy Synod]], led by a lay government official. Meanwhile, all vestiges of local self-government were removed, and Peter continued and intensified his predecessors' requirement of state service for all nobles.

Peter died in 1725, leaving an unsettled succession and an exhausted realm. His reign raised questions about Russia's backwardness, its relationship to the West, the appropriateness of reform from above, and other fundamental problems that have confronted many of Russia's subsequent rulers. Nevertheless, he had laid the foundations of a modern state in Russia.

===Ruling the Empire (1725&ndash;1825)=== 
{{Citations missing|section|date=July 2007}}
[[Image:Nowgorod 2005 Millenium Monument.jpg|thumb|left|An 1862 monument celebrating the [[Millennium of Russia]].]]
Nearly forty years were to pass before a comparably ambitious and ruthless ruler appeared on the Russian throne. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], the Great, was a German princess who married the German heir to the Russian crown. Finding him an incompetent plebeian, Catherine tacitly consented to his murder. It was announced that he had died of "[[apoplexy]]", and in 1762 she became ruler.

Catherine contributed to the resurgence of the Russian nobility that began after the death of Peter the Great. State service had been abolished, and Catherine delighted the nobles further by turning over most government functions in the provinces to them.

Catherine the Great extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with actions including the support of the [[Targowica Confederation]], although the cost of her campaigns, on top of the oppressive social system that required lords' serfs to spend almost all of their time laboring on the lords' land, provoked a major peasant uprising in 1773, after Catherine legalized the selling of serfs separate from land. Inspired by another Cossack named [[Yemelyan Pugachev|Pugachev]], with the emphatic cry of "Hang all the landlords!" the rebels threatened to take Moscow before they were ruthlessly suppressed. Catherine had Pugachev drawn and quartered in [[Red Square]],<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/emelyan-ivanovich-pugachev/ Emelyan Ivanovich Pugachev Biography] in the  ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''.</ref> but the specter of revolution continued to haunt her and her successors.

Catherine successfully waged war against the decaying Ottoman Empire<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|title=History|work=Parallel 60|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> and advanced Russia's southern boundary to the Black Sea. Then, by allying with the rulers of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]], she incorporated the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. By the time of her death in 1796, Catherine's expansionist policy had made Russia into a major European power. This continued with [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I's]] wresting of [[Finland]] from the weakened kingdom of [[Sweden]] in 1809 and of [[Bessarabia]] from the Ottomans in 1812. 

[[Napol<U+00E9>on I of France|Napoleon]] made a major misstep when he declared war on Russia after a dispute with Tsar Alexander I and launched an [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|incvasion of the tsar's realm]] in 1812. The campaign was a catastrophe. In the bitterly cold Russian weather, thousands of French troops were ambushed and killed by peasant guerrilla fighters. As Napoleon's forces retreated, the Russian troops pursued them into Central and Western Europe and to the gates of Paris. After Russia and its allies defeated Napoleon, Alexander became known as the 'savior of Europe,' and he presided over the redrawing of the map of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), which made Alexander the monarch of [[Congress Poland]].

Although the Russian Empire would play a leading political role in the next century, secured by its defeat of Napoleonic France, its retention of serfdom precluded economic progress of any significant degree. As West European economic growth accelerated during the [[Industrial Revolution]], which had begun in the second half of the 18th century, Russia began to lag ever farther behind, creating new problems for the empire as a great power.

===Imperial Russia since the Decembrist Revolt (1825&ndash;1917)===
====The Decembrist Revolt====
Russia's great power status obscured the inefficiency of its government, the isolation of its people, and its economic backwardness.{{Lopsided}} Following the defeat of Napoleon, Alexander I was willing to discuss constitutional reforms, and though a few were introduced, no thoroughgoing changes were attempted.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The tsar was replaced by his younger brother, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1825&ndash;1855), who at the onset of his reign was confronted with an uprising.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The background of this revolt lay in the Napoleonic Wars, when a number of well-educated Russian officers traveled in Europe in the course of the military campaigns, where their exposure to the liberalism of Western Europe encouraged them{{Fact|date=July 2007}} to seek change on their return to autocratic Russia. The result was the [[Decembrist Revolt]] (December 1825), the work of a small circle of liberal nobles and army officers who wanted to install Nicholas' brother as a constitutional monarch. But the revolt was easily crushed, leading Nicholas to turn away from the Westernization program begun by Peter the Great and champion the maxim "[[Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Nationality|Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Respect to the People]]."{{Fact|date=July 2007}} 

After the Russian armies occupied allied [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 1802, they clashed with [[Persia]] over control of [[Azerbaijan]] and got involved into the [[Caucasian War]] against mountaineers, which would lumber on for half a century.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} Russian tsars had also to deal with the unrest in their newly acquired territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where the population discontented by the loss of independence staged [[Polish Uprisings#Uprisings against the rule of Imperial Russia|two armed revolts]]. As a result, the initially moderate Russian policies there turned increasingly autocratic.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

====Ideological schisms and reaction====
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2007}}
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]
The harsh retaliation for the revolt made "December Fourteenth" a day long remembered by later revolutionary movements. In order to repress further revolts, schools and universities were placed under constant surveillance and students were provided with official textbooks. Police spies were planted everywhere. Would-be revolutionaries were sent off to Siberia; under Nicholas I hundreds of thousands were sent to ''[[katorga]]'' there.

In this setting [[Michael Bakunin]] would emerge as the father of [[anarchism]]. He left Russia in 1842 to Western Europe, where he became active in the socialist movement. After participating in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] of 1849, he was imprisoned and shipped to Siberia, but eventually escaped and made his way back to Europe. There he practically joined forces with [[Karl Marx]], despite significant ideological and tactical differences. Alternative social doctrines were elaborated by such Russian radicals as [[Alexander Herzen]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]].

The question of Russia's direction had been gaining steam ever since Peter the Great's program of Westernization.{{clarifyme}} Some favored imitating Europe while others renounced the West and called for a return of the traditions of the past. The latter path was championed by  [[Slavophile]]s, who heaped scorn on the "decadent" West.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The Slavophiles were opponents of bureaucracy,  preferred the [[collectivism]] of the [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] Russian ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', or [[obshchina|village community]], to the [[individualism]] of the West.

====Alexander II and the abolition of serfdom====
{{Citations missing|section|date=July 2007}}
Tsar Nicholas died with his philosophy in dispute. One year earlier, Russia had become involved in the [[Crimean War]], a conflict fought primarily in the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/russian.htm|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Russian Philosophy|accessdate=2007-07-23|author=Thomas Nemeth}}</ref> Since playing a major role in the defeat of Napoleon, Russia had been regarded as militarily invincible, but, once pitted against a coalition of the great powers of Europe, the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed the decay and weakness of Tsar Nicholas' regime.

When [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] came to the throne in 1855, desire for reform was widespread. A growing humanitarian movement, which in later years has been likened to that of the [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] in the [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War]], attacked serfdom. In 1859, there were more than 23 million serfs living under conditions frequently worse than those of the peasants of [[western Europe]] on 16th century [[Manorialism|manor]]s. Alexander II made up his own mind to abolish serfdom from above rather than wait for it to be abolished from below through revolution.

The [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|emancipation of the serfs]] in 1861 was the single most important event in 19th century Russian history. It was the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracy's monopoly of power. Emancipation brought a supply of free labor to the cities, industry was stimulated, and the middle class grew in number and influence; however, instead of receiving their lands as a gift, the freed peasants had to pay a special tax for what amounted to their lifetime to the government, which in turn paid the landlords a generous price for the land that they had lost. In numerous instances the peasants wound up with the poorest land. All the land turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the ''mir'', the village community, which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings. Although serfdom was abolished, since its abolition was achieved on terms unfavorable to the peasants, revolutionary tensions were not abated, despite Alexander II's intentions.

In the late 1870s Russia and the Ottoman Empire again clashed in the Balkans. From 1875 to 1877, the Balkan crisis escalated with rebellions against Ottoman rule by various Slavic nationalities, which the Ottoman Turks suppressed with what was seen as great cruelty in Russia. Russian nationalist opinion became a serious domestic factor in its support for liberating Balkan Christians from Ottoman rule and making Bulgaria and Serbia independent. In early 1877, Russia intervened on behalf of Serbian and Russian volunteer forces when it went to war with the Ottoman Empire. Within one year, Russian troops were nearing Constantinople, and the Ottomans surrendered. Russia's nationalist diplomats and generals persuaded Alexander II to force the Ottomans to sign the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] in March 1878, creating an enlarged, independent Bulgaria that stretched into the southwestern Balkans. When Britain threatened to declare war over the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano, an exhausted Russia backed down. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in July 1878, Russia agreed to the creation of a smaller Bulgaria. As a result, Russian nationalists were left with a legacy of bitterness against Austria-Hungary and Germany for failing to back Russia. The disappointment as a result of war stimulated revolutionary tensions in Russia.

====Nihilism====
In the 1860s a movement known as [[Nihilist movement|Nihilism]] developed in Russia. For some time many Russian liberals had been dissatisfied by the empty discussions of the [[intelligentsia]]. The Nihilists questioned all old values  and shocked the Russian establishment.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The Nihilists first attempted to convert the aristocracy to the cause of reform.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Failing there, they turned to the peasants. Their "go to the people" campaign became known as the [[Narodnik]] movement.<ref name = CurtisT>[http://countrystudies.us/russia/6.htm Transformation of Russia in the Nineteenth Century], excerpted from Glenn E. Curtis (ed.), ''Russia: A Country Study'', Department of the Army, 1998. ISBN 0160612128.</ref>

While the Narodnik movement was gaining momentum, the government quickly moved to extirpate it. In response to the growing reaction of the government, a radical branch of the Narodniks advocated and practiced [[terrorism]].<ref name = CurtisT/> One after another, prominent officials were shot or killed by bombs. Finally, after several attempts, [[Alexander II]] was assassinated in 1881, on the very day he had approved a proposal to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms in addition to the abolition of serfdom designed to ameliorate revolutionary demands.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

====Autocracy and reaction under Alexander III====
[[Image:Kramskoy Alexander III.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] (1886)]]
Unlike his father, the new tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] (1881&ndash;1894) was throughout his reign a staunch reactionary who revived the maxim of "Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Respect to the People" of Nicholas I.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} A committed Slavophile, Alexander III believed that Russia could be saved from chaos only by shutting itself off from the subversive influences of Western Europe. In his reign Russia concluded the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|union with republican France]] to contain the growing power of [[Germany]],} completed the conquest of [[Central Asia]], and exacted important territorial and commercial concessions from [[China]].{{Facts|date=July 2007}}

The tsar's most influential adviser was [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], tutor to Alexander III and his son Nicholas, and procurator of the Holy Synod from 1880 to 1895. He taught his royal pupils to fear freedom of speech and press and to hate democracy, constitutions, and the parliamentary system.<ref>Hugo S.

====Nicholas II and a new revolutionary movement====
Alexander was succeeded by his son [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] (1894&ndash;1917). The Industrial Revolution, which began to exert a significant influence in Russia, was meanwhile creating forces that would finally overthrow the tsar. Politically, these opposition forces organized into three competing parties: The liberal elements among the industrial capitalists and nobility, who believed in peaceful social reform and a constitutional monarchy, founded the [[Constitutional Democratic party]] or ''Kadets'' in 1905.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Followers of the Narodnik tradition established the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] or ''Esers'' in 1901, advocating the distribution of land among those who actually worked it&mdash;the peasants.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} A third and more radical group founded the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] or ''RDSLP'' in 1898; this party was the primary exponent of [[Marxism]] in Russia. Gathering their support from the radical intellectuals and the urban working class, they advocated complete social, economic and political revolution.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

In 1903 the RDSLP split into two wings: the radical [[Bolshevik]]s, led by Lenin, and the relatively moderate [[Menshevik]]s, led by Lenin's former friend Yuli Martov.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The Mensheviks believed that Russian socialism would grow gradually and peacefully and that the tsar<U+2019>s regime should be succeeded by a democratic republic in which the socialists would cooperate with the liberal bourgeois parties.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} The Bolsheviks, under [[Vladimir Lenin]], advocated the formation of a small elite of professional revolutionists, subject to strong party discipline, to act as the vanguard of the proletariat in order to seize power by force.<ref>For an analysis of the reaction of the elites to the revolutionaries see Manning, Roberta. ''The Crisis of the Old Order in Russia: Gentry and Government''. Princeton University Press, 1982.</ref>

==Russian Revolution==
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}
[[Image:Soviet Union, Lenin (55).jpg|thumb|right|[[Vladimir Lenin]] speaking to Red Army troops before their departure to the Polish front.]]
Bound by treaty, Tsar Nicholas II and his subjects entered [[World War I]] at the defense of [[Serbia]]. At the opening of hostilities in August of 1914, the Russians took the offensive against both [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in support of her French ally.<ref>Keegan, 139.</ref> 

Later, military failures and bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned large segments of the population against the government.<ref name = CurtisAut/> Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies and exporting goods.<ref name = CurtisAut/>

By the middle of [[1915]] the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel were in short supply, casualties kept occuring, and inflation was mounting.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} Meanwhile, public distrust of the regime was deepened by reports that a semiliterate mystic, [[Grigory Rasputin]], had great political influence within the government. His assassination in late 1916 ended the scandal but did not restore the autocracy's lost prestige.<ref name = CurtisAut/>

On [[March 3]], [[1917]], a strike occurred in a factory in the capital [[Petrograd]] (formerly St. Petersburg). On [[February 23]] ([[March 8]]) 1917, International Women's Day, thousands of women textile workers in Petrograd walked out of their factories protesting the lack of food and calling on other workers to join them. Within days, nearly all the workers in the city were idle, and street fighting broke out.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} When the tsar ordered the Duma to disband, ordered strikers to return to work, and ordered troops to shoot at demonstrators in the streets, his orders triggered the [[February Revolution]], especially when soldiers openly sided with the strikers.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} On [[March 2]] (15), Nicholas II abdicated. To fill the vacuum of authority, the Duma declared a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], headed by [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]].<ref name = HistoryC>[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=221104 The Russian Revolution] in the [[History Channel]] Encyclopedia.</ref> Meanwhile, the socialists in Petrograd organized elections among workers and soldiers to form a soviet (council) of workers' and soldiers' deputies, as an organ of popular power that could pressure the "bougeois" Provisional Government.<ref name = HistoryC/>

In July, following a series of crises that undermined their authority with the public, the head of the Provisional Government resigned and was succeeded by [[Alexander Kerensky]], who was more progressive than his predecessor but not radical enough for the Bolsheviks or many Russians discontented with the deepening economic crisis and the continuation of the war.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} While Kerensky's government marked time, the socialist-led soviet in Petrograd joined with soviets that formed throughout the country to create a national movement.

In the fall of 1918 the Bolshevik regime was in a perilous position, opposed by Russia's former allies and internal enemies, as well as in sporadic conflict with short-lived nationalist republics in Belarus and Ukraine and anarchist forces.

To counteract this emergency, a reign of terror was begun within Russia as the [[Red Army]] and the [[Cheka]] (the secret police) destroyed all enemies of the revolution. However lofty their goals were, the Bolsheviks did not have the consent of all elements of society and thus had to force their rule over Russia during the civil war. They swept away the tsarist secret police, so despised by Russians of all political persuasions, along with other tsarist institutions, but ensured the survival of their own regime by replacing it with a political police of considerably greater dimensions, both in the scope of its authority and in the severity of its methods.

===Creation of the Soviet Union===
{{Citations missing|section|date=July 2007}}
The history of Russia between 1922 and 1991 is essentially the history of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or [[Soviet Union]]. This ideologically-based union, established in December 1922 by the leaders of the Russian Communist Party,<ref>"[http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/themes/society/rsussr.html Tsar Killed, USSR Formed]," in ''20th Century Russia''. Retrieved 21 July 2007.</ref> was roughly coterminous with the Russian Empire. At that time, the new nation included four constituent republics: the [[Russian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Belarusian SSR]], and the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]].<ref>Soviet Union Information Bureau, [http://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/1928/sufds/ch01.htm Area and Population]. Retrieved 21 July 2007.</ref>

The constitution, adopted in 1924, established a federal system of government based on a succession of soviets set up in villages, factories, and cities in larger regions. This pyramid of soviets in each constituent republic culminated in the All-Union Congress of Soviets. But while it appeared that the congress exercised sovereign power, this body was actually governed by the Communist Party, which in turn was controlled by the [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] from Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, just as it had been under the tsars before Peter the Great.

Land, all industry and small businesses were [[nationalized]] and the money economy was restricted. Strong opposition soon developed.<ref name="Richman"/> The peasants wanted cash payments for their products and resented having to surrender their surplus grain to the government as a part of its civil war policies. Confronted with peasant opposition, Lenin began a strategic retreat from war communism known as the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP).<ref name="Richman"/> The peasants were freed from wholesale levies of grain and allowed to sell their surplus produce in the open market. Commerce was stimulated by permitting private retail trading. The state continued to be responsible for banking, transportation, heavy industry, and public utilities.

Although the left opposition among the Communists criticized the rich peasants or [[kulak]]s who benefited from the NEP, the program proved highly beneficial and the economy revived.<ref name="Richman"/> The NEP would later come under increasing opposition from within the party following Lenin's death in early 1924.<ref name="Richman"/>

The government also promoted [[atheism]] and [[materialism]], which formed the basis of Marxist theory.

[[Image:Magnito.jpg|thumb|left|The construction of steel-producing city of [[Magnitogorsk]] in 1932 appears above. Magnitogorsk was at the forefront of Stalin's Five-Year Plans in the 1930s.]]

The years from 1929 to 1939 comprised a tumultuous decade in Russian history<U+2014>a period of massive industrialization and internal struggles as [[Joseph Stalin]] established near total control over Russian society, wielding unrestrained power unknown to even the most ambitious tsars. Following Lenin's death Stalin wrestled to gain control of the Soviet Union with rival factions in the Politburo, especially [[Leon Trotsky]]'s. By 1928, with the [[Trotskyist]]s either exiled or rendered powerless, Stalin was ready to put a radical program of industrialization into action.<ref name = Deutscher>I. Deutscher, ''Stalin: A Political Biography'', Oxford University Press, 1949, pp. 294<U+2013>344.</ref>

In 1928 Stalin proposed the [[First Five-Year Plan]].<ref name="Richman"/> Abolishing the NEP, it was the first of a number of plans aimed at swift accumulation of capital resources though the buildup of heavy industry, the [[Collectivisation in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]], and the restricted manufacture of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]].<ref name="Richman"/> For the first time in history a government controlled all economic activity. While in the capitalist countries factories and mines were idle or running on reduced schedules during the [[Great Depression]] and millions were unemployed, the Soviet people worked many hours a day, six days a week, in a thoroughgoing attempt to revolutionize the Soviet economic structure.

As a part of the plan, the government took control of agriculture through the state and collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]es'').<ref name="conquest-coll">[[Conquest, Robert]]. ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. ISBN 0195051807.</ref> By a decree of February 1930, about one million individual peasants (''[[kulaks]]'') were forced off their land. Many peasants strongly opposed regimentation by the state, often slaughtering their herds when faced with the loss of their land. In some sections they revolted, and countless peasants deemed "kulaks" by the authorities were executed.<ref>Viola, Lynne. ''Peasant Rebels under Stalin. Collectivization and the Culture of Peasant Resistance''. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. ISBN 0195131045.</ref> The combination of bad weather, deficiencies of the hastily-established collective farms, and massive confiscation of grain precipitated a serious famine,<ref name="conquest-coll"/> and several million peasants [[Soviet famine of 1932-1934|died of starvation]], [[Holodomor|mostly in Ukraine]] and parts of southwestern Russia.<ref name="conquest-coll"/> The deteriorating conditions in the countryside drove millions of desperate peasants to the rapidly growing cities, fueling industrialization, and vastly increasing Russia's urban population in the space of just a few years.

The plans received remarkable results in areas aside from agriculture. Russia, in many measures the poorest nation in Europe at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, now industrialized at a phenomenal rate, far surpassing Germany's pace of industrialization in the nineteenth century and Japan's earlier in the twentieth century. Soviet authorities claimed in 1932 an increase of industrial output of 334% over 1914, and in 1937 a further increase of 180% over 1932. Moreover, the survival of Russia in the face of the impending [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] onslaught was made possible in part through the capacity for production that was the outcome of industrialization.

While the Five-Year Plans were forging ahead, Stalin was establishing his personal power. The [[NKVD]] gathered in tens of thousands of Soviet citizens to face arrest, [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation]], or execution. Of the six original members of the 1920 Politburo who survived Lenin, all were purged by Stalin. Old Bolsheviks who had been loyal comrades of Lenin, high officers in the Red Army, and directors of industry were liquidated in the [[Great Purges]].<ref name="conquest-terror">[[Conquest, Robert]]. ''[[The Great Terror: A Reassessment]]''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. ISBN 0195071328.</ref> Purges in other Soviet republics also helped centralize control in the USSR.

Stalin's repressions led to the creation of a vast system of internal exile, of considerably greater dimensions than those set up in the past by the tsars. Draconian penalties were introduced and many citizens were prosecuted for fictitious crimes of sabotage and espionage. The labor provided by convicts working in the [[labor camp]]s of the [[Gulag]] system became an important component of the industrialization effort, especially in Siberia.<ref name="forcedlabor">Gregory, Paul R. & Valery Lazarev (eds.).

In the 1960s the USSR became a leading producer and exporter of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Breakup of the Union===
Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. After the rapid succession of former KGB Chief [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced [[perestroika]] in an attempt to modernize Soviet communism, and made significant changes in the party leadership.{{Facts|date=July 2007}} However, [[Perestroika|Gorbachev's social reforms]] led to unintended consequences. Because of his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'', which facilitated public access to information after decades of government repression, social problems received wider public attention, undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the [[revolutions of 1989]] the USSR lost its satellites in Eastern Europe. ''Glasnost'' allowed ethnic and nationalist disaffection to reach the surface.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Many constituent republics, especially the [[Baltic republics]], [[Georgian SSR]] and [[Moldavian SSR]], sought greater autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of petroleum and natural gas, ongoing [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|war in Afghanistan]], outdated industry and pervasive corruption, the Soviet [[planned economy]] proved to be uneffective, and by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to [[price control]], there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be lucky enough to buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow. 

The tension between Soviet Union and Russian SFSR authorities came to be personified in the bitter power struggle between Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmZjYmUzZmQ1ZmFlMTc5NjA1ZWZiZTgwMTM1ZDVkOTk=|title=Boris on a Pedestal|quote=In the process he engaged in a power struggle with Mikhail Gorbachev... |author=David Pryce-Jones|work=National Review Online|accessdate=2007-07-22|date=2000-03-20}}</ref> Squeezed out of Union politics by Gorbachev in 1987, Yeltsin, an old-style party boss with no dissident background or contacts, needed an alternative platform to challenge Gorbachev.

At last Gorbachev [[New Union Treaty|attempted to restructure]] the Soviet Union into a less centralized state. However, on [[August 19]][[1991]], a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup against Gorbachev]], conspired by senior Soviet officials, was attempted. The coup faced wide popular opposition and collapsed in three days, but disintegration of the Union became imminent. The Russian government took over most of the Soviet Union government institutions on its territory. Because of the dominant position of Russians in the Soviet Union, most gave little thought to any distinction between Russia and the [[Soviet Union]] before the late 1980s. In the Soviet Union, only Russian SFSR lacked even the paltry instruments of statehood that the other republics possessed, such as its own republic-level Communist Party branch, [[trade union]] councils, [[Academy of Sciences]], and the like.<ref>{{cite web|quote=Because of the Russians' dominance in the affairs of the union, the RSFSR failed to develop some of the institutions of governance and administration that were typical of public life in the other republics: a republic-level communist party, a Russian academy of sciences, and Russian branches of trade unions, for example.|work=Country Studies|title=Government|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/68.htm|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] was banned in Russia in 1991-1992, although no [[lustration]] has ever taken place, and many of its members became top Russian officials. However, as the Soviet government was still opposed to market reforms, the economic situation continued to deteriorate. By December 1991, the shortages had resulted in the introduction of food [[rationing]] in Moscow and Saint Petersburg for the first time since World War II. Russia received humanitarian food aid from abroad. After the [[Belavezha Accords]], Russia denounced the [[Soviet Union Treaty]] on December 12. The Soviet Union officially broke up on [[December 25]][[1991]],<ref name="BBC Timeline">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1112551.stm|work=BBC|title=Timeline: Soviet Union|quote=1991 25 December - Gorbachev resigns as Soviet president; US recognises independence of remaining Soviet republics|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> and the [[Russian Federation]] (formerly the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Russian+Soviet+Federal+Socialist+Republic|work=The Free Dictionary|title=Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic|quote=The largest republic of the former Soviet Union; it became independent as the Russian Federation in 1991|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>) took power on [[December 26]].<ref name="BBC Timeline" /> The Russian government lifted price control on [[January 2]][[1992]].

Although Yeltsin came to power on a wave of optimism, he never recovered his popularity after endorsing [[Yegor Gaidar]]'s "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]" of ending Soviet-era price controls, drastic cuts in state spending, and an open foreign trade regime in early 1992 (''see'' [[Economy of Russia#Economic Reform in the 1990s|Russian economic reform in the 1990s]]). The reforms immediately devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups that had enjoyed the benefits of Soviet-era state-controlled wages and prices, state subsidies, and welfare entitlement programs. In the 1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression.<ref>Peter Nolan, ''China's Rise, Russia's Fall''. Macmillan Press, 1995. pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref>

Meanwhile, the profusion of small parties and their aversion to coherent alliances left the legislature chaotic. During 1993, Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|September<U+2013>October 1993 constitutional crisis]]. The crisis climaxed on [[October 3]], when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the [[White House of Russia|Russian White House]], blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came close to a serious civil conflict. Yeltsin was then free to impose the [[constitution of the Russian Federation|current Russian constitution]] with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. But the December voting also saw sweeping gains for communists and nationalists, reflecting growing disenchantment with the costs of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms.

Economic reforms also consolidated a semi-criminal oligarchy with roots in the old Soviet system. Advised by Western governments, the [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]], Russia embarked on the largest and fastest [[privatization]] that the world had ever seen in order to reform the fully [[nationalized]] Soviet economy. By mid-decade, retail, trade, services, and small industry was in private hands. Most big enterprises were acquired by their old managers, engendering a new rich ([[Russian oligarch|Russian tycoons]]) in league with [[Russian Mafia|criminal mafias]] or Western investors.<ref>See Fairbanks, Jr., Charles H. 1999. "The Feudalization of the State". ''Journal of Democracy'' 10(2):47&ndash;53.</ref> At the bottom, many workers were forced by inflation or unemployment into poverty, prostitution, or crime.

By the mid-1990s Russia had a system of multiparty electoral politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/9176-3.cfm|title=Russian president praises 1990s as cradle of democracy|work=Johnson's Russia List|accessdate=2007-07-20}}</ref> But it was harder to establish a representative government because of two structural problems&mdash;the struggle between president and parliament and the anarchic party system. Although Yeltsin had won plaudits abroad for casting himself as a democrat to weaken Gorbachev, his conception of the presidency was highly autocratic. He either acted as his own prime minister (until June 1992) or appointed men of his choice, regardless of parliament.

Meanwhile, the central government had lost control of the localities, bureaucracy, and economic fiefdoms; tax revenues had collapsed. Still in deep depression by the mid-1990s, Russia's economy was hit further by the [[Russian financial crisis|financial crash of 1998]]. After the 1998 financial crisis, Yeltsin was at the end of his political career. Just hours before the first day of 2000, Yeltsin made a surprise announcement of his resignation, leaving the government in the hands of the little-known Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], a former KGB official and head of the KGB's post-Soviet successor agency [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]].<ref>CNN [http://archives.cnn.com/1999/WORLD/europe/12/31/yeltsin.resigns.04/ Apologetic Yeltsin resigns; Putin becomes acting president].

Nevertheless, reversion to a socialist command economy seemed almost impossible, meeting widespread relief in the West.
