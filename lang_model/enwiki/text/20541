'''Ivan the Terrible''' (born c. 1920) is the name given to a notorious guard at the [[Treblinka concentration camp]] during the [[Holocaust]].

Ivan was known to be [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. Ivan's job at the camp was to operate the motors that ran the gas chambers. He was also known for his extreme cruelty. Holocaust survivor Chiel Rajchman reported that Ivan was about 25 years old at the time he worked in the camp. He was known to cut off the ears of workers as they walked by, and these people were forced to continue working as they bled from their severed ear. Shortly after, he would shoot the person. He also tortured victims with pipes, swords and whips before they were killed in the gas chambers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=HOLOCAUST BYSTANDERS - THE UKRAINIANS |author=Alexander Kimel |url=http://kimel.net/Ukraine.html |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref>

Ivan's true identity was never discovered, but [[John Demjanjuk]] has been accused of being Ivan. He was tried in Israel in 1986 and sentenced to death, but the conviction was overturned due to lack of evidence. Demjanjuk was later convicted by a German court of being a different guard, and that case was under appeal when he died.
