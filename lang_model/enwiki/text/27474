'''''Black Eye''''' is the only full length studio album by the English [[punk rock]] band [[Fluffy (band)|Fluffy]], released on September 17, 1996 by [[The Enclave (record label)|The Enclave]]. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in [[London]] and produced by punk rock veteran [[Bill Price (record producer)|Bill Price]], who had recorded albums by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]]. The album was recorded live in the studio and the music was not [[Arrangement|arranged]] by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.

To promote the album, the band embarked on a major tour in Europe and both coasts of the United States, including a performance at [[CBGB]] in [[New York City]]. The songs "Husband" and "Nothing" reached number 58 and number 52 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Upon release, ''Black Eye'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Most journalists praised the album's unrelenting mood, but some criticised the vagueness of the lyrics.

== Background and recording ==
''Black Eye'' is the only full length album by the English [[punk rock]] band [[Fluffy (band)|Fluffy]]. The band formed in [[London]] in late 1994 by singer and guitarist Amanda Rootes, guitarist Bridget Jones, bassist Helen Storer, and drummer Angie Adams.<ref name="AllMusic bio"/> Unsatisfied with the [[Britpop]] invasion at the time, the band sought to recapture the punk rock phenomenon. According to Rootes, "We want to infiltrate and conquer the masses. It's like, Americans think English music's shit <U+2013> 'cause it is. We want [England] to gain a little respect that we haven't had for a while."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The band also felt more comfortable in North America than in the UK because the British press "can't handle the concept of a sexually frank all-girl band"; the name of the band comes from a lesbian novel titled ''Fluffy Butch'', which Rootes thought was funny.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

After turning down a number of [[record label]]s, the band signed to [[The Enclave (record label)|The Enclave]], a record label run by [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed [[Guns N' Roses]] to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]].<ref name="Billboard"/> Rootes felt that Zutaut was "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists."<ref name="Select 1996"/> ''Black Eye'' was recorded at Metropolis Studios in [[London]] and produced by punk rock veteran [[Bill Price (record producer)|Bill Price]], who had recorded albums by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]].<ref name="BE Booklet"/><ref name="Spin"/> The album was recorded live in the studio and the music was not [[Arrangement|arranged]] by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff like that. I did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound."<ref name="Gaesteliste interview"/> The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a [[Ringo Starr]] reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound.<ref name="Gaesteliste interview"/> The album was [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by George Marino at Sterling Sound in [[New York City]].<ref name="BE Booklet"/>

== Music and lyrics ==
Musically, ''Black Eye'' was described by Carrie Borzillo of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as "pure hardcore punk delivered with a raunchy, abrasive vocal assault from [Rootes]."<ref name="Billboard"/> Aaron Axelsen, music director at modern rock [[KITS]], opined that the band is "a real [[Independent music|indie]], edgy version of [[Elastica]], but not Britpop. They fit into that [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Tuscadero]], [[Veruca Salt]], edgy thing."<ref name="Billboard"/> The band, however, felt "insulted" when journalists compared them to Elastica because they think the sound of Elastica is too "clean". As Rootes recalls, "I admit every time me and Bridged cleaned our house we put Elastica on".<ref name="Spin"/> Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the [[Buzzcocks]], as the only UK bands among her favorites.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The band cited the Sex Pistols, the [[New York Dolls]], and [[The Stooges]] as their musical influences.<ref name="Billboard"/> They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash. According to Rootes, "The Sex Pistols are political in a great teenage fuck-you way. The Clash are political in a mature way, like they've done politics in A-levels."<ref name="Spin"/>

The lyrics of ''Black Eye'' deal with sexual and abuse topics: "Nothing you will likely hear on the radio", Rootes explained.<ref name="Gaesteliste interview"/> The song "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use.<ref name="CMJ"/> The title track, "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about <U+2013> to get it out of my system."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies.<ref name="Select 1996"/> Similarly, the song "Scream" deals with [[rape]] issues, while "Dirty Old Bird" is about spousal abuse.<ref name="Drop-D review"/> The track "Technicolour Yawn" is about the unpleasant effect of a [[hangover]],<ref name="Drop-D review"/> "Psychofudge" is about drug usage,<ref name="DiS review"/> and "Cheap" deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming "sort of cheap and common."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

Not all the songs from the album explore social issues.<ref name="UWO Gazette"/> The songs "I Wanna Be Your Lush" and "Too Famous" use [[satire]] to criticise the superior attitudes of male musicians, while "Husband" disapproves "gruff and pushy" boyfriends.<ref name="UWO Gazette"/><ref name="CMJ"/> The band also clarified that they have nothing against men. As Rootes notes, "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men."<ref name="CMJ"/> The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band.<ref name="UWO Gazette"/> Rootes told ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'': "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from [[Courtney Love]], who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about [[PJ Harvey]]. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman."<ref name="Select 1995"/>

== Promotion and release ==

''Black Eye'' is the first full-length released by The Enclave. To promote the launch of the album, the record label, who had been working with the band since December 1995, released several singles for "Husband", "Psychofudge", "Cheap", and "Hypersonic" prior to the album release.<ref name="Billboard"/> The Enclave also released an [[Extended play|EP]] consisting of five live songs recorded at New York's [[CBGB]] on May 15, 1996 and released on July 9, 1996 to further awareness of the band.<ref name="Billboard"/> Prominent music critic [[Robert Christgau]] described the sound of the EP as "as pure punk as the '90s get."<ref name="EP review"/> Zutaut also admitted that the band's punk attitude "may scare radio and [[MTV]] a little bit", but he believed that their melodic music and lyrical statements "would pave the way for its success."<ref name="Billboard"/>

The band embarked on a major tour in both coasts of the United States in April, May, and September 1996. In Europe, the band also toured in Ireland with [[Foo Fighters]], appeared at major summer festivals, and played with the Sex Pistols, [[Iggy Pop]], and the Buzzcocks at Finsbury Park in London in June 23, 1996.<ref name="Billboard"/> The album was released on September 17, 1996 in the US and September 30, 1996 in the UK.<ref name="Billboard"/> The songs "Husband" and "Nothing" reached number 58 and number 52 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="UK charts"/> A [[music video]] was made for "Black Eye" under the direction of [[Floria Sigismondi]].<ref name="Music video"/>

Upon release, ''Black Eye'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tom Sinclair, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', stated that the album "barrels forward with such high-spirited hookiness that it's possible to forgive the shameless pandering of lyrics like 'I wanna be your kitten/Caress my fur.'"<ref name="EW review"/> In a very positive review, prominent music critic Robert Christgau felt that most of the songs "live up to the underlining" and considered the album to be the best punk debut since the ones by the [[Ramones]], Sex Pistols, The Clash, and [[Wire (band)|Wire]].<ref name="Christgau review"/> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Tom Demalon praised the loud guitar playing of both Rootes and Jones and opined that "the lack of dynamic diversity makes ''Black Eye'' somewhat of a one-trick pony, but it's a trick that makes the album's strongest tracks a joy."<ref name="AllMusic review"/>

Nick Duerden of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine remarked that ''Black Eye'' "sounds like a cross between The Stooges and Courtney Love. And despite boasting the musical dexterity of [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]], it's a short, sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile."<ref name="Q review"/> Similarly, critic Roy Wilkinson of ''Select'' compared some songs favourably to The Stooges and early-[[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. However, he noted that the band "[seems] intent on falling short of PJ [Harvey]'s black-bordered presence. When was the last time you heard the Yeovil [[delta blues]] sound enlivened by such [[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]] Riffing-isms as 'I've rocketed to Uranus' ('Nothing') and 'When the kids scream, there is a racket/You've got a magnificent packet' ('Too Famous')?"<ref name="Select 1996"/>

In a negative review, Darren Gawle of ''Drop-D'' magazine criticised the lyrics for their vague observations about obvious truths, stating: "The only shocking thing about ''Black Eye'' lies in a band trying to pass themselves off as [[Riot grrrl|Riot Grrls]] when in fact they pack as much 'Grrr' as a slightly vexed [[Yorkshire Terrier]]."<ref name="Drop-D review"/> In contrast, Colin Weston of ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' commented: "The thing about Fluffy, is they aren't the most lyrically challenging of bands, but their music more then makes up for it, and what they DO say, you understand immediately... not messing about with 'Deep and meaningful' lyrics, these girls have got something to say, and say it the only way they know how... in your face!!!"<ref name="DiS review"/> Although ''Black Eye'' was not ranked in the Top 40 of ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll for 1996,<ref name="Pazz & Jop"/> Christgau placed it at number 3 in his own "Dean's List".<ref name="Dean's List"/>
