The '''MAI Kvant''' (also known as the '''MAI-SKB-3PM''') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aerobatic trainer designed by students at the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]].<ref name="nemecek" /> In October 1967 the aircraft was displayed at the Economic Achievment Exhibition in Moscow.<ref name="nemecek" /> The Kvant was a single-seat low-wing monoplane with a retractable main landing gear and a fixed tailwheel. It was powered by a {{convert|360|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Vedeneyev M14P]] radial engine. The aircraft held five official FAI world records.<ref name="oskbes" />
