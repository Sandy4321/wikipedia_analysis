'''John Herschel Glenn, Jr.''' (born July 18, 1921) is a retired [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Aviator|pilot]], [[astronaut]], and [[United States Senate|United States senator]].  He was the first [[United States|American]] to [[orbit]] the [[Earth]] and the fifth person in space, after cosmonauts [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Gherman Titov]] and fellow Mercury Seven astrononauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. Glenn was a [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|combat aviator]] in the Marine Corps and one of the [[Mercury Seven]], who were the elite U.S.&nbsp;military test pilots selected by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]&nbsp;(NASA) to operate the experimental [[Mercury spacecraft]] and become the first American astronauts. He flew the ''[[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship&nbsp;7]]'' mission on February 20, 1962. In 1965, Glenn retired from the military and resigned from NASA so he could be eligible to stand for election to public office. As a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] he was elected to represent [[Ohio]] in the U.S.&nbsp;Senate from 1974 to 1999.

Glenn received a [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in 1978, and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2012. He was inducted into the [[Astronaut Hall of Fame]] in 1990. On October 29, 1998, he became the oldest person to fly in space, and the only one to fly in both the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Space Shuttle program]]s, when at age 77, he flew on [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] ([[STS-95]]). Glenn and [[Scott Carpenter]] are the last living members of the [[Mercury Seven]].

==Early life and military career==
[[File:Colonel John Glenn official photo.jpg|thumb|left|Military portrait of John Glenn]]
John Glenn was born in [[Cambridge, Ohio|Cambridge]], [[Ohio]], to John Glenn, Sr. and Teresa (n<U+00E9>e Sproat).<ref>http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/collection/audiovisuals/certificates.htm</ref> He was raised in [[New Concord, Ohio]]. Glenn studied science at [[Muskingum College]], and received his private pilot's license for physics course credit in 1941.

===World War II===
When the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into [[World War&nbsp;II]], he left college to enlist in the [[U.S.&nbsp;Army Air Corps]]; however, the Army did not call him up, and in March&nbsp;1942 he enlisted as a [[United States Navy aviation]] cadet. He trained at [[Naval Air Station Olathe]], [[Kansas]], where he made his first solo flight in a military aircraft. During advanced training in 1943 at the [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], he was reassigned to the [[U.S.&nbsp;Marine Corps]].<ref>[http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/glennbio.php Ohio State University Biography]</ref>

After completing his training, Glenn was assigned to Marine squadron [[VMJ-353]], flying [[R4D]] transport planes. He eventually managed a transfer to [[VMF-155]] as an [[F4U&nbsp;Corsair]] fighter pilot, and flew 59 combat missions in the South Pacific.<ref name="Shettle">Shettle ''USMC Air Station of WWII'', p. 167</ref> He saw action over the [[Marshall Islands]], where he attacked anti-aircraft batteries and dropped bombs on [[Maloelap Atoll]]. In 1945 he was assigned to [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]], where he was promoted to Captain shortly before the war ended.

Glenn flew patrol missions in North China with the [[VMF-218]] squadron, until it was transferred to [[Guam]]. In 1948 he became a flight instructor at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]], then attended the amphibious warfare school and received.

===Korean War===
Glenn was next assigned to [[VMF-311]], flying the new [[F9F&nbsp;Panther]] jet interceptor. He flew his Panther in 63&nbsp;combat missions during the [[Korean War]], gaining the dubious nickname "magnet ass" from his apparent ability to attract enemy [[flak]]. Twice he returned to base with over 250&nbsp;flak holes in his aircraft.<ref>Mersky ''USMC Aviation'', p. 183</ref> Glenn flew for a time with [[Ted Williams]], a future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|hall of fame]] baseball player for the [[Boston Red Sox]], as his [[wingman]]. He also flew with future Major General [[Ralph H. Spanjer]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-02-12/news/9902120350_1_long-military-career-boarding-marine-corps | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Ralph H.

[[File:F-86 'MiG Mad Marine'.jpg|thumb|left|Glenn's USAF [[F-86 Sabre|F-86F]] that he dubbed "MiG Mad Marine" during the [[Korean War]], 1953]]

Glenn flew a second Korean combat tour on an interservice exchange program with the [[United States Air Force]], [[4th Fighter Wing]]. He logged 27&nbsp;missions in the faster [[F-86 Sabre#Variants|F-86F&nbsp;Sabre]], and shot down three [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15s]] near the [[Yalu River]] in the final days before the ceasefire.

===Test Pilot===
Glenn returned to NAS Patuxent River, appointed to the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|Test Pilot School]] (class&nbsp;12). He served as an armament officer, flying planes to high altitude and testing their cannons and machine guns. On July 16, 1957, Glenn completed the first supersonic [[transcontinental flight]] in a [[F-8 Crusader|Vought F8U-1P Crusader]].

The flight from [[Los Alamitos Army Airfield|NAS Los Alamitos, California]], to [[Floyd Bennett Field]], [[New York]], took 3&nbsp;hours, 23&nbsp;minutes and 8.3&nbsp;seconds. As he passed over his hometown, a child in the neighborhood reportedly ran to the Glenn house shouting "Johnny dropped a bomb! Johnny dropped a bomb! Johnny dropped a bomb!" as the [[sonic boom]] shook the town. Project Bullet, the name of the mission, included both the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed (despite three [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelings]] during which speeds dropped below 300&nbsp;mph), and the first continuous transcontinental [[Panoramic photography|panoramic photograph]] of the United States. For this mission Glenn received his fifth [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=John|authorlink=John Glenn|coauthors=Taylor, Nick|title=John Glenn: A Memoir|publisher=Bantam|pages=169|date=November 2, 1998|isbn=978-0-553-11074-6}}</ref>

In April 1959, despite the fact that Glenn had not earned the required college degree, he was assigned to [[NASA]] as one of the [[Mercury Seven|original group of seven astronauts]] chosen for [[Project Mercury]]. During this time, he remained an officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]].

John Glenn became the first American to [[orbit]] the Earth, aboard ''[[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship 7]]'' on February 20, 1962, on the Mercury-Atlas 6&nbsp;mission, circling the globe three times during a flight lasting 4&nbsp;hours, 55&nbsp;minutes, and 23&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/bios/mercury_mission.html|title=Glenn Orbits the Earth|publisher=NASA|accessdate=June 10, 2008}}</ref> This made Glenn the third American in space and the fifth human being in space.

Flight controllers had Glenn modify his re-entry procedure by keeping his [[retrorocket]] pack on over the shield in an attempt to keep it in place. He made his [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] safely, and afterwards it was determined that the indicator was faulty.

As the first American in orbit, Glenn was celebrated as a national hero, and received a [[ticker-tape parade]] in [[New York City]], reminiscent of that given for [[Charles Lindbergh]] and other great dignitaries.

[[File:John Glenn at the Mercury Control Center.jpg|thumb|left|Glenn at the Mercury Control Center on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Base]]His fame and political attributes were noted by the Kennedys, and he became a personal friend of the [[Kennedy family]]. On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy escorted him in a parade to Hangar&nbsp;S at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], where he awarded Glenn with the NASA service medal

In July 1962 Glenn testified before the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Space Committee]] in favor of excluding women from the NASA astronaut program.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/astronauts/astronauts02.html ''One Giant Leap<U+2014>Backward''], The Globe and Mail, October 12, 2002</ref> The impact of the testimony of so prestigious a hero is debatable, but no female astronaut flew on a NASA mission until [[Sally Ride]] in 1983, and none piloted a mission until [[Eileen Collins]] in 1995, more than 30 years after the hearings. In the late 1970s, Glenn is reported to have supported Shuttle Mission Specialist Astronaut [[Judith Resnik]] in her career.<ref>{{cite book

Glenn resigned from NASA six weeks after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] to run for office in his home state of Ohio. In 1965 he retired as a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] from the Marine Corps and entered the business world as an executive for [[Royal Crown Cola]]. He re-entered politics later on. Some accounts of Glenn's years at NASA suggest that Glenn was prevented from flying in [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] or [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions, either by President Kennedy, or by NASA management, on the grounds that the subsequent loss of a national hero of such stature would seriously harm or even end the manned space program. Yet Glenn resigned from the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] on January 30, 1964, well before even the first [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] crew was assigned.

In 1990, Glenn was inducted into the [[Astronaut Hall of Fame]].

Three decades later, after serving 24&nbsp;years in the [[United States Senate]], Glenn lifted off for a second space flight on October 29, 1998, on [[Space Shuttle Discovery]]'s [[STS-95]], in order to study the effects of space flight on the elderly. At age&nbsp;77, Glenn became the oldest person to go into space. Glenn states in his memoir that he had no idea that [[NASA]] was willing to send him back into space when [[NASA]] announced the decision.<ref>{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=John|authorlink=John Glenn|coauthors=Taylor, Nick|title=John Glenn: A Memoir|publisher=Bantam|pages=231|date=November 2, 1998|isbn=978-0-553-11074-6}}</ref> Three days prior to NASA's announcement, various radio stations were reporting that NASA had decided to send Glenn back into space. Glenn's participation in the nine-day mission was criticized by some in the space community as a junket for a politician. Others noted that Glenn's flight offered valuable research on weightlessness and other aspects of space flight on the same person at two points in life thirty-six years apart<U+2014>by far the longest interval between space flights by the same person<U+2014>providing information on the effects of spaceflight and weightlessness on the elderly, with an ideal [[control variable|control]]. Upon the safe return of the STS-95&nbsp;crew, Glenn (and his crewmates) received another [[ticker-tape parade]], making him the tenth, and latest, person to have received multiple ticker-tape parades in a lifetime (as opposed to that of a sports team).<ref>[[List of ticker-tape parades in New York City]]</ref> Just prior to the flight, on October 15, 1998, and for several months after, the main [[causeway]] to the Johnson Space Center, NASA Road&nbsp;1, was temporarily renamed "John Glenn Parkway".<ref>[http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2012/02/its-been-50-years-since-john-glenn-circled-the-earth/#3197-2 John Glenn Parkway][http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/wp-content/blogs.dir/1842/files/john-glenn/hi_j0063.jpg photo]</ref> Glenn was one of several NASA astronauts who experienced both a [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] and touchdown on dry land.

Glenn vehemently opposed the sending of [[Dennis Tito]], the world's first [[Space tourism|space tourist]], to the International Space Station on the grounds that Tito's trip served no scientific purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/03/space.day/index.html|work=CNN|title=John Glenn: Space tourist cheapening Alpha|date=May 3, 2001|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref>

==Life in politics==

===Senate===
[[NASA]] psychologists determined during Glenn's training that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] suggested to Glenn and his wife in December&nbsp;1962 that he should run against incumbent [[United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] of Ohio in the 1964 [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[primary election]]. In 1964 Glenn announced that he was resigning from the space program to run against Young, but withdrew when he hit his head on a bathtub. Glenn sustained a [[concussion]] and injured his inner ear, and recovery left him unable to campaign.<ref name="raines19831113">{{cite news | title=John Glenn: The Hero as Candidate | work=The New York Times | date=November 13, 1983 | accessdate=May 14, 2011 | author=Raines, Howell | pages=40}}</ref> Glenn remained close to the [[Kennedy family]] and was with Robert Kennedy when he was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated in 1968]].

In 1970, Glenn was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary for nomination for the Senate by fellow Democrat [[Howard Metzenbaum]], by a 51% to 49% margin. Metzenbaum lost the general election race to [[Robert Taft,&nbsp;Jr.]] In 1974, Glenn resisted Ohio governor [[John J. Gilligan]] and the Ohio Democratic party's demand that he run for [[Lieutenant Governor of Ohio|Lieutenant Governor]]. Instead, he challenged Metzenbaum again, whom Gilligan had appointed{{r|raines19831113}} to the Senate to replace [[William&nbsp;B. Saxbe]], who had resigned to become Attorney General of the United States.

In the primary race, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn's military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had "never worked for a living". Glenn's reply came to be known as the "[[Gold Star Mother]]s" speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans' hospital and "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn't hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job." Many felt the "Gold Star Mothers" speech won the primary for Glenn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Glenn won the primary by 54 to 46%. After defeating Metzenbaum, Glenn defeated [[Ralph Perk]], the Republican [[mayor of Cleveland]], in the general election, beginning a Senate career that would continue until 1999. In 1980, Glenn won re-election to the seat, defeating Republican challenger [[United States Senate elections, 1980|Jim Betts]], by over 40 percent.

In 1986, Glenn defeated challenger U.S.&nbsp;Representative [[Tom Kindness]]. Metzenbaum would go on to seek a rematch against Taft in 1976, winning a close race on [[Jimmy Carter]]'s coattails.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Glenn and Metzenbaum had strained relations. There was a thaw in 1983 when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president and again in 1988 when Metzenbaum was opposed for re-election by [[List of mayors of Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland mayor]] [[George Voinovich]]. Voinovich accused Metzenbaum of being soft on [[child pornography]]. Voinovich's charges were criticized by many, including Glenn who now came to Metzenbaum's aid, recording a statement for television refuting Voinovich's charges. Metzenbaum won the election by 57 to 43%.

[[File:LC-14 Glenn plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Plaque near [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Mercury launch pad]] ]]

===Savings and loan scandal===
Glenn was one of the five U.S.&nbsp;senators caught up in the [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association|Lincoln Savings]] and [[Keating Five]] Scandal after accepting a $200,000 contribution from [[Charles Keating]]. Glenn and Republican Senator [[John McCain]] were the only Senators exonerated. The Senate Commission found that Glenn had exercised "poor judgment". The association of his name with the scandal gave Republicans hope that he would be vulnerable in the 1992 campaign. Instead, Glenn defeated [[Lieutenant Governor of Ohio|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Mike DeWine]] to keep his seat, though his percentage was reduced to a career low of 51%. DeWine used the memorable campaign slogan, "What ''on earth'' has John Glenn done?"<ref name="whatonearth">Clifford Krauss {{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81E3EF936A25753C1A964958260 | title = In Big Re-election Fight, Glenn Tests Hero Image |work=New York Times | date = October 15, 1992 | accessdate =July 21, 2008| first=Clifford | last=Krauss}}</ref> This 1992 re-election victory was the last time a Democrat won a statewide race in Ohio until 2006; DeWine later won Metzenbaum's seat upon his retirement.

===Vice-president run===
In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Glenn was a candidate for the Democratic vice presidential nomination. However, Glenn's keynote address at the Democratic National Convention failed to impress the delegates and the nomination went to veteran politician [[Walter Mondale]]. Glenn also ran for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1984|1984 Democratic presidential nomination]]. A November&nbsp;1983 ''New York Times''/CBS News poll found him second, supported by 41% of those polled, to Mondale's 49%.

Glenn and his staff worried about the 1983 release of ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', a film about the original seven Mercury astronauts based on the best-selling [[Tom Wolfe]] [[The Right Stuff (book)|book of the same name]]. The book had depicted Glenn as a "zealous moralizer", and he did not attend the film's Washington premiere on October 16, 1983. Reviewers saw [[Ed Harris]]' portrayal of Glenn as heroic, however, and his staff immediately began to emphasize the film to the press. Aide Greg Schneiders suggested an unusual strategy, similar to Glenn's personal campaign and voting style, in which he would avoid appealing to narrow [[special interest group]]s and instead seek to win support from ordinary Democratic primary voters, the "constituency of the whole".{{r|raines19831113}} Mondale defeated Glenn for the nomination however, and he was left with $3&nbsp;million in campaign debt for over 20&nbsp;years before he was granted a reprieve by the [[Federal Election Commission]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/015fcc08-1df1-11dd-983a-000077b07658.html Well of donors dries up for Clinton] ''Edward Luce and Stephanie Kirchgaessner'' '''FT.com''' Washington May 9, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/us/politics/10clinton.html For Clinton, Millions in Debt and Few Options] ''Michael Luo'' the '''New York Times''' June 10, 2008</ref> He was a potential vice presidential running mate in 1984, 1988, and 1992.

===Issues===
During his time in the Senate, he was chief author of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978]], served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs|Committee on Governmental Affairs]] from 1987 until 1995, sat on the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] committees and the [[U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging|Special Committee on Aging]]. Once Republicans regained control of the Senate, Glenn also served as the ranking minority member on a special Senate investigative committee chaired by [[Tennessee]] senator [[Fred Dalton Thompson]] that looked into illegal foreign [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy|donations by China]] to U.S.&nbsp;political campaigns for the 1996 election. There was considerable acrimony between the two very high-profile senators during the life of this committee, which reached a level of public disagreement between the five leaders of a congressional committee seldom seen in recent years, amid allegations that Glenn suppressed these issues prior to his subsequent space shuttle flight which had to be approved by President Clinton.<ref>[http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/washington/2007/10/15/Fred-Thompson-Failed-Hearings Fred Thompson's Big Flop] ''Matthew Cooper'' '''Portfolio.com''' Washington October 15, 2007</ref> In 1998, Glenn declined to run for re-election. [[Mary O. Boyle]] was the Democratic party nominee. She faced Republican nominee and sitting governor [[George Voinovich]] in the [[United States Senate election in Ohio, 1998|general election]], which Voinovich won.

==Public affairs institute==
Glenn helped found the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at the [[Ohio State University]] in 1998 to encourage public service. On July 22, 2006, the institute merged with OSU's School of Public Policy and Management to become the [[John Glenn School of Public Affairs]]. Today he holds an adjunct professorship at both the Glenn School and OSU's Department of Political Science.

On April 6, 1943, Glenn married his childhood sweetheart, [[Annie Glenn|Anna Margaret Castor]]. They had met in New Concord and played together in the school band. They are the parents of two children. Both Glenn and his wife attended [[Muskingum College]] in [[New Concord, Ohio]]. He also was a member of the Stag Club Fraternity at Muskingum College.

Glenn is descended from the Glenn<U+2013>Macintosh clan of [[Scotland]]. In 1963 he received a letter from a young girl in [[Sheffield]], England, named Anne Glenn. The letter, congratulating him on his orbit around the Earth, enclosed a family tree showing that Anne's father, George Arthur Thomas Glenn, and John Glenn were cousins. The news made it into the South Yorkshire Times, and a viewed [http://5.eho.st/pjlsfms0 copy retained by Anne's younger sister] Glenn was also one of the original owners for a [[Holiday Inn]] franchise near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida, that is today known as the [[Seralago Hotel & Suites]].<ref>[http://www.seralagohotel.com/hotel/seralago-history.php The history of ''Seralago Hotel & Suites''] at SeralagoHotel.com</ref><ref>{{cite book
