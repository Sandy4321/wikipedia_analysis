It went into effect on the day it was signed. It was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on September 8, 1937.<ref>''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 181, pp. 102-105.</ref>

==Effects==
At first the treaty led to improving relations between the [[Kuomintang]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government and the [[USSR]]. Following the signing of the pact, the [[Soviet Union]] began sending aircraft to the Chinese national government in [[Operation Zet]], as well as economic aid to help stave off Japanese occupation.  Chiang hoped this was a precursor to Soviet intervention into the war, however as time passed he soon realized that the USSR was constricted in what aid it could actually provide, due to not wanting to upset the tacit alliance with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and later the [[United States]], who favored [[China]] in the war but, would back [[Japan]] against the [[USSR]] in order to weaken both.

The treaty also allowed the [[USSR]] to focus its attention more on the Western border where [[Nazi Germany]] was building up for what appeared to be war with the [[USSR]] especially after the  [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]] was signed. The pact contributed to the worsening relationship between [[China]] and [[Nazi Germany]], which culminated in the end of [[Sino-German cooperation|German military assistance in China]].

==Breach of the pact by the Soviet Union==
Ironically, in 1937, while the pact was being signed, the Soviets brazenly breached it before and after the signing, conducting the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]] from August to October. 

The Soviet Army was assisting its puppet Governor [[Sheng Shicai]] in [[Xinjiang]]. The Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Hushan led the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] to resist the invasion.

Before the invasion, Ma Hushan had communicated with Chiang Kaishek, and he mentioned to [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] that Chiang was going to send help to fight the Soviets. However, the outbreak of war with Japan led Ma Hushan to face the Soviet Invasion on his own, despite resisting and killing Russian soldiers, Ma Hushan's forces eventually succumbed to Soviet mustard gas bombardment, and Ma Hushan fled to India, where he took a steamer back to China.

Sheng Shicai then invited Soviet forces to garrison in [[Turfan]], right next to Gansu province.

The Republic of China government was fully aware of the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang province, and Soviet troops moving around Xinjiang and Gansu, but was forced to mask these maneuvers to the public as "Japanese propaganda" to avoid an international incident and for continued military supplies from the Soviets.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&dq=ma+hongkui+japanese+abolish+prince&q=soviet+border+japanese+proganda#v=onepage&q=soviet%20border%20japanese%20propaganda&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|isbn=0-415-58264-4|page=58|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

The Chinese government responded with its own military moves. The Muslim General [[Ma Buqing]] was in virtual control of the [[Gansu]] corridor at this time.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=DEZKTPtzgfvwBramnT8&ct=result&id=y3oeAAAAMAAJ&dq=salar+army++Ma+pu-fang&q=Ma+pu-fang|title=Asia, Volume 40|author=|year=1940|publisher=Asia Magazine|location=|page=|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but since the Soviet threat was great, Chiang made some arrangements regarding Ma's position. In July 1942 Chiang Kai-shek instructed Ma Buqing to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the [[Qaidam Basin]] of [[Qinghai]].<ref>[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a908173170 War, Leadership and Ethnopolitics: Chiang Kai-shek and China's frontiers, 1941-1945]</ref><ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:MuUxsYkb5VUJ:www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/February_2007/Lin.pdf+ma+buqing+sheng+chiang&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShsX_CMGlUVO6zWebB3sZZ8K0cWBp0w0dpZeuShWcHHSgSibQG2vqrxwnUodL4alQRSG_wNAolMBwZ1RG-5fLm2IshLqxdp6F-eVN6h2jcbKDxPFVuBEp3zgo8mzHS1BYvJGeMs&sig=AHIEtbQSxcNMSqTADOVwqDf-E-j4Br1Heg Nationalists, Muslim Warlords, and the <U+201C>Great Northwestern Development<U+201D> in Pre-Communist China]</ref> Chiang named Ma Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten [[Sheng Shicai]]'s southern flank in [[Xinjiang]], which bordered  Tsaidam.

After Ma evacuated his positions in Gansu, Kuomintang troops from central China flooded the area, and infiltrated Soviet occupied Xinjiang, gradually reclaiming it and forcing Sheng Shicai to break with the Soviets.

The [[Ili Rebellion]] broke out in [[Xinjiang]] when the Kuomintang Chinese Muslim Officer [[Liu Bin-Di]] was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur Rebels in November 1944. The [[Soviet Union]] supported the Turkic rebels against the Kuomintang, and Kuomintang forces were fighting back.

The [[Kuomintang]] Chinese government ordered Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] several times to march his troops into Xinjiang to intimidate the pro Soviet Governor [[Sheng Shicai]]. This helped provide protection for Chinese settling in Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JvPUAAAAMAAJ&q=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&dq=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&hl=en&ei=S8q0TLCeFsH98Aa758nHCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA|title=A regional handbook on Northwest China, Volume 1|author=Human Relations Area Files, inc|year=1956|publisher=Printed by the Human Relations Area Files|location=|isbn=|page=74|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> Ma Bufang was sent with his Muslim Cavalry to [[Urumqi]] by the Kuomintang in 1945 during the [[Ili Rebellion]] to protect it from the Uyghur army from Hi (name for [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] at that time).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a4yQAAAAMAAJ&q=In+September+1945+he+and+his+Moslem+cavalry+moved+into+Sinkiang+to+defend+Urumchi+against+the+advance+of+the+Moslem+rebels+from+Hi.+He+has+considerable+influence+with+the+Chinese+Moslems+and+his+appointment+was+designed+to+check+any&dq=In+September+1945+he+and+his+Moslem+cavalry+moved+into+Sinkiang+to+defend+Urumchi+against+the+advance+of+the+Moslem+rebels+from+Hi.+He+has+considerable+influence+with+the+Chinese+Moslems+and+his+appointment+was+designed+to+check+any&hl=en&ei=itm0TJmWOcGB8gbT_P2VCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA|title=British documents on foreign affairs: reports and papers from the Foreign Office confidential print.
