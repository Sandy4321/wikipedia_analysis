==History==
===First World War===
Originally formed in early 1915, the brigade consisted of four infantry [[battalion]]s<U+2014>the [[21st Battalion (Australia)|21st]], [[22nd Battalion (Australia)|22nd]], [[23rd Battalion (Australia)|23rd]] and [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Battalion]]<U+2014>all of which were raised in [[Victoria]].<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 68.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_13055.asp|title=6th Brigade|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> After being sent to [[Egypt]] in June 1915 with the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] as part of an expansion of the [[Australian Imperial Force]], the brigade was sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in September, however, as the last [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] offensive had come to an end the previous month, from then up until December 1915 when the Anzacs were evacuated from the peninsula, the brigade was not involved in any significant engagements.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11208.asp|title=21st Battalion, World War I|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> Later, in 1916, they were transferred to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where they took part in the fighting in the trenches until the end of the war.<ref name=AWM/>

During their time on the Western Front, the 6th Brigade was involved in a number of major battles including the [[Battle of Pozieres]], the [[Battle of Mouquet Farm]], and the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Bullecourt]]. They were also involved in beating back the tide of the German [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 before taking part in the final campaign of the war as part of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].<ref name=AWM/>

===Inter war years===
In 1920, following the re-organisation of the [[Citizens Military Force]] (CMF), 6th Brigade became part of the 4th Infantry Division, encompassing units drawn from Victoria and [[South Australia]].<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 91.</ref> In 1928, it became part of the 3rd Military District and was re-organised to include the [[7th Battalion (Australia)|7th]], [[8th Battalion (Australia)|8th]], 21st and [[38th Battalion (Australia)|38th Battalions]].<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 102.</ref>

===Second World War===
At the start of the [[Second World War]], the 6th Brigade undertook garrison duties in [[Western Australia]],<ref name=2div>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/army/AHU/docs/Brief_History_of_2nd_Division.pdf|title=Brief History of the 2nd Division|publisher=Army History Unit|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> however, in July 1943, consisting of the [[14th Battalion (Australia)|14th/32nd]], [[19th Battalion (Australia)|19th]] and [[36th Battalion (Australia)|36th Battalions]], was sent to [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]].<ref name=AWM2>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11951.asp|title=19th Battalion (South Sydney Regiment), World World II|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-0907}}</ref><ref name=AWM3>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11954.asp|title=36th Battalion (St. George's English Rifle Regiment), World War II|publisher=Austalian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-09-78}}</ref><ref name=AWM4>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11307.asp|title=14th/32nd Battalion (Prahan/Footscray Regiment), World War II|publisher=Austalian War Memorial|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> Based in [[Buna]], in Papua, they carried out garrison duties as well as patrols around the areas surrounding Milne and Nassu Bay. In May 1944, they moved to [[Lae]]. In June they were sent to Buolo for a rest, before returning to Lae in September where they were transferred from the 4th Division to the [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Division]] and the decision was made to send them to [[New Britain campaign|New Britain]].<ref name=AWM2/>  

In November advanced elements of the brigade from the 19th Battalion landed at Jacquinot Bay, and after the other two battalions arrived they began a campaign of harrassment against the much larger Japanese forces on the island, with the objective of restricting the ability of the Japanese to freedom of action in the area.<ref name=AWM2/> The brigade advanced along the coast, using barges, crossing the Mevelo River in February before carrying out a number of patrols towards the Wulwut River to the east. In mid-March, they came up against the main Japanese defensive line in the Waitavalo<U+2013>Tol Plantation around Bacon Hill and over the course of two days, the 19th Battalion and 14th/32nd fought to capture it.<ref name=AWM2/><ref name=AWM4/>

Following this, the 6th Brigade established a defensive line that extended across the Gazelle Peninsula, and from there they continued to mount patrols into Japanese held-territory until April 1945 when they were withdrawn back to Australia.<ref name=AWM2/> Although it was originally planned that the brigade would re-organise to make up its losses and begin training for participation in further operations, as the war in the Pacific wound down, the decision was made disbanded the 6th Brigade and a number of its component units in July 1945.<ref name=AWM2/>

===Post War===
In 1948, the CMF was re-raised<ref name=2div/> and 6th Brigade was allocated to [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]].<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 209.</ref>  By April 1953, it was part of Southern Command.<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 238.</ref>

The [[Ready Reserve Scheme (Australia)|Ready Reserve Scheme]] was established in 1991 and the brigade was re-organised around this scheme, forming a combined arms element consisting of roughly 3,719 personnel incorporating [[6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], [[49th Battalion (Australia)|49th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment]], [[3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment (Australia)|'A' Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment]], 139th Siginals Regiment, 1st Field Regiment and the 6th Brigade Adminstrative Support Battalion.<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 351.</ref> At this time, the 3rd Division was disbanded and 6th Brigade was re-allocated to the 2nd Division.<ref>Kuring 2004, p. 403.</ref>

Later, in 1996, after the decision was made to discontinue the Ready Reserve Scheme, 6th Brigade was disbanded and its units were merged with others and reallocated to [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]].<ref>Palazzo 2001, p. 354.</ref>
