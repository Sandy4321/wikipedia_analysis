The '''Azusa Street Revival''' was a [[Pentecostal]] [[revival meeting]] that took place in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and was led by [[William J. Seymour]], an [[African American]] [[preacher]]. It began with a meeting on [[April 14]], [[1906]] at the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and continued until roughly [[1915]].  The revival was characterized by [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], dramatic worship services, and inter-racial mingling.  The participants received criticism from secular media and [[Christian]] [[theologian]]s for behaviors considered to be outrageous and unorthodox, especially at the time.  Today, the revival is considered by historians to be the primary catalyst for the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in the [[20th century]].

== Background ==
=== Welsh Revival ===

In [[1904]], the [[1904-1905 Welsh Revival|Welsh Revival]] took place, during which approximately 100,000 people in [[Wales]] [[convert|converted]] to [[Christianity]].  Internationally, [[Evangelism|Evangelical]] [[Christians]] took this event to be a sign that a fulfillment of the [[Bible prophecy|prophecy]] in the [[Bible]]'s book of [[Book of Joel|Joel]], chapter 2:23<U+2013>29 was about to take place.  Joseph Smale, pastor of the First Baptist Church in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], went to Wales personally in order to witness the [[Revivalism|revival]].  Upon his return to Los Angeles, he attempted to ignite a similar event in his own congregation.  His attempts were short-lived, and he eventually left First Baptist Church to found First New Testament Church, where he continued his efforts.<ref name="Enrichment Journal">{{cite web | last = McGee | first = Gary | title = William J. Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival | publisher = Enrichment Journal | url = http://www.ag.org/enrichmentjournal/199904/026_azusa.cfm | accessdate = May 17, 2007}}</ref>  During this time, other small-scale revivals were taking place in [[Minnesota]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Texas]].  By [[1905]], reports of [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], supernatural healings, "physical demonstrations of emotion", and significant lifestyle changes accompanied these revivals.  As news spread, evangelicals across the [[United States]] began to pray for similar revivals in their own congregations.<ref name="Azusa History">{{cite web | title = Azusa History | publisher = International Center for Spiritual Renewal | url = http://www.icfsr.org/history.html | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref>

[[Image:William seymour.png|left|thumb|150px|[[William J. Seymour]], leader of the Azusa Street Revival.]]
In 1905, 34 year old son of former slaves [[William J. Seymour]] was a student of well-known pentecostal preacher [[Charles Parham]] and an interim pastor for a small [[Holiness movement|holiness]] church in [[Houston, Texas]].<ref name="MISSION">{{cite web | last = Cloud | first = David | title = AZUSA STREET MISSION | url = http://www.tribwatch.com/azusa.htm | accessdate = May 24, 2007 }}</ref>  Neely Terry, an [[African American]] woman who attended a small [[Holiness movement|holiness]] church pastored by Julia Hutchins in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], made a trip to visit family in Houston late in 1905.<ref name="Azusa History"/>  While in Houston, she visited Seymour's church, where he preached that baptism in the Holy Spirit was accompanied with speaking in tongues, and though he had not experienced this personally, Terry was impressed with his character and message.  Once home in California, Terry suggested that Seymour be invited to speak at the local church.<ref name="charismaticcentury"/>  Seymour received and accepted the invitation in February of 1906, and received financial help and a blessing from Parham for his planned one-month visit.<ref name="Enrichment Journal"/><ref name="Azusa History"/>

[[Image:029 bonnie brae house.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Asberry home on 214 North Bonnie Brae Street.]]
News of the events at North Bonnie Brae St. quickly circulated among the African American, [[Latino]] and [[White (race)|White]] residents of the city, and for several nights, various speakers would [[preach]] to the crowds of curious and interested onlookers from the front porch of the Asberry home.  Members of the audience included people from a broad spectrum of income levels and religious backgrounds.  Hutchins eventually spoke in tongues herself as her whole congregation began to attend the meetings.  Soon the crowds became very large, and were full of people speaking in tongues, shouting, singing and moaning.  Finally, the front porch collapsed, forcing the group to begin looking for a new meeting place.<ref name="centuryoftheholyspirit"/>  A resident of the neighborhood described the happenings at 214 North Bonnie Brae with the following words:

{{Cquote|They shouted three days and three nights.  It was Easter season.  The people came from everywhere.  By the next morning there was no way of getting near the house.  As people came in they would fall under God's power; and the whole city was stirred.  They shouted until the foundation of the house gave way, but no one was hurt.<ref name="centuryoftheholyspirit"/>}}

== Revival at Azusa Street ==
=== Conditions ===
[[Image:312 azusa street low.jpg|thumb|left|200px|312 Azusa Street, [[Los Angeles, California]], prior to its purchase by the revivalists.]]
The group from Bonnie Brae Street eventually discovered an available building at 312 Azusa Street, which had originally been constructed as an African Methodist Episcopal Church in what was then a [[black]] [[ghetto]] part of town.<ref name="centuryoftheholyspirit"/>  The rent was only $8.00 a month.<ref name="Bartleman">{{cite book | last = Bartleman | first = Frank | year = 1980 | title = Azusa Street | publisher = Bridge-Logos Publishers | id = ISBN 0-88270-439-7}}</ref>  A newspaper referred to the downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] building as a <U+201C>tumble down shack.<U+201D><ref name="dictionary"/>   Since the church had moved out, the building had served as a wholesale house, a warehouse, a lumberyard, stockyards, a tombstone shop, and had most recently been used as a stable with rooms for rent upstairs.  it was a small, rectangular, flat-roofed building, approx. 60 feet (18.28m) long and 40 feet wide (12.19m), totaling 2,400 feet<sup>2</sup> (222.96 m<sup>2</sup>), sided with weathered whitewashed clapboards.  The only sign that it had once been a house of god was a single gothic-style window over the main entrance.<ref name="centuryoftheholyspirit"/>

Discarded lumber and plaster littered the large, barn-like room on the ground floor.<ref name="Let us Reason">{{cite web | title = Azusa St. and modern Pentecostalism - The 100 year celebration of what? | publisher = Let us Reason Ministries | url = http://www.letusreason.org/Pent57.htm | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="launched">{{cite web | title = Azusa Street Revival (1906 - 1909) | publisher = lutherproductions.com | url = http://demo.lutherproductions.com/historytutor/basic/modern/stories/azuza.htm | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref>  Nonetheless, it was secured and cleaned in preparation for services.

The second floor at the now-named "Apostolic Faith Mission"<ref name="Washingtonpost"/> housed an office and rooms for several residents including Seymour and his new wife, Jennie. It also had a large prayer room to handle the overflow from the altar services below.  The prayer room was furnished with chairs and benches made from [[California Redwood]] planks, laid end to end on backless chairs.<ref name="Enrichment Journal"/><ref name="dictionary"/>
[[Image:AFM on azusa street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Apostolic Faith Mission on Azusa Street, now considered to be the birthplace of [[Pentecostalism]].]]

By mid-May of 1906,<ref name="Azusa Street Timeline"/> anywhere from 300<ref name="Azusa History"/> to 1500 people would attempt to fit into the building.  Since horses had very recently been the residents of the building, flies constantly bothered the attendees.<ref name="CBNnews"/>  People from a great diversity of backgrounds came together to worship: men, women, children, [[Black (race)|black]], white, [[Hispanic]], [[Asian]], [[Wealthy|rich]], [[Poverty|poor]], [[illiterate]], and [[educated]].<ref name="Azusa Street Revival"/>  People of all ages flocked to Los Angeles with both skepticism and a desire to participate.<ref name="CBNnews"/><ref name="Azusa History"/>  The intermingling of races and the groups encouragement of women in leadership was remarkable, as 1906 was the height of the "[[Jim Crow]]" era of racial segregation,<ref name="Washingtonpost"/> and fourteen years prior to women receiving [[suffrage]] in the [[United States]].

=== Services and worship ===

Worship at 312 Azusa Street was frequent, spontaneous, and ecstatic, with services going almost around the clock.  Among those attracted to the revival were not only members of the [[Holiness Movement]], but [[Baptists]], [[Mennonites]], [[Quakers]], and [[Presbyterians]].<ref name="Bartleman"/>  An observer at one of the services wrote these words: 

{{Cquote|No instruments of music are used.  None are needed.  No choir- the angels have been heard by some in the spirit.  No collections are taken.  No bills have been posted to advertise the meetings.  No church organization is back of it.  All who are in touch with God realize as soon as they enter the meetings that the Holy Ghost is the leader.<ref name="blackapostles"/>}}

The [[Los Angeles Times]] was not so kind in its description:

{{Cquote|Meetings are held in a tumble-down shack on Azusa Street, and the devotees of the weird doctrine practice the most fanatical rites, preach the wildest theories and work themselves into a state of mad excitement in their pecular zeal.  Colored people and a sprinking of whites compose the congregation, and night is made hideous in the neighborhood by the howlings of the worshippers, who spend house swaying forth and back in a nerve racking attitude of prayer and supplication.  They claim to have the "gift of tongues" and be able to understand the babel.<ref name="charismaticcentury"/>}}

Charles Parham was also sharp in his criticism:

{{Cquote|Men and women, white and blacks, knelt together or fell across one another; a white woman, perhaps of wealth and culture, could be seen thrown back in the arms of a big 'buck nigger,' and held tightly thus as she shivered and shook in freak imitation of Pentecost.

The first edition of the Apostolic Faith Publication reported a common reaction to the revival from visitors:

{{Cquote|Proud, well-dressed preachers came to 'investigate'.  Soon their high looks were replaced with wonder, then conviction comes, and very often you will find them in a short time wallowing on the dirty floor, asking God to forgive them and make them as little children.<ref name="racism"/>}}

Among first-hand accounts were reports of the [[Blindness|blind]] having their sight restored, diseases cured instantly, and [[immigrants]] speaking in [[German language|German]], [[Yiddish]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] all being spoken to in their native language by uneducated [[Black (race)|black]] members, who translated the languages into English by "supernatural ability"<ref name="blackapostles"/>  

Singing was sporadic and in [[A cappella|acappella]] or occasionally in [[Glossolalia|tongues]].  There were periods of extended silence.  Attenders were occasionally [[slain in the Spirit]].  Visitors gave their [[Testimony#Religious testimony|testimony]] and members read aloud testimonies that were sent to the mission by mail.  There was prayer for the gift of tongues.  There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in.  There was spontaneous preaching and [[altar call]]s for [[salvation]], [[sanctification]] and [[Baptism in the Holy Spirit|baptism of the Holy Spirit]].  Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings.  The members of the mission never took an [[Tithe|offering]], but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival.<ref name="dictionary"/>  The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50-60 individuals, with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.<ref name="charismaticcentury"/>

=== Beliefs ===
[[Image:Charlesparham.gif|thumb|220px|right|[[Charles Parham]], Seymour's teacher, who is now considered to be one of the founders of [[Pentecostalism]]]]
Seymour and the other revivalists at the Apostolic Faith Mission on Azusa Street held to five core beliefs:<ref name="launched"/>
#[[Salvation#Christianity|Salvation]] by [[Sola fide|faith alone]].
#[[Sanctification]] (or [[Holiness]]) of the believer.
#[[Glossolalia|Tongues]] as evidence of [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|Spirit Baptism]].
#[[Faith healing]] as part of God's [[Salvation|redemption]].
#The "very soon" return of [[Christ]].

=== Charles Parham ===
{{main|Charles Parham}}

By October of 1906, [[Charles Parham]] was invited to speak for a series of meetings at Azusa Street, but was quickly un-invited.  Several reasons can be given for Azusa Street's disassociation from him.  Firstly, Parham had personality conflicts with Seymour, and wanted to be the chief authority figure of the movement that was taking place, but the presiding leaders of the Apostolic Faith Mission were slow to make any changes to their methods or leadership.  Secondly, rumors were surfacing that Parham has been committing [[sodomy]] ("an unnatural offense") with young males.<ref name="dictionary">{{Citation | last = Burgess | first = Stanley M. | last2 = McGee | first2 = Gary B. | title = Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements | publisher = Zondervan Publishing House | year = 1988 | location = 1415 Lake Drive, SE Grand Rapids, Michigan 49506 | pages = pp. 31-36 | isbn = 0-310-44100-5 }}</ref>  In [[1907]], he was formally charged with sodomy, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.  Thirdly, Parham was offended by the mixing of races that was common to the Azusa Street Revival, and wished to establish [[segregation]] in their meetings.  By [[1910]], Parham was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  Parham also had cause for concern due to the increasing attendance of [[magician]]s, self-styled [[prophet]]s and folk religionists at the meetings.<ref name="Azusa Street Timeline"/><ref name="Let us Reason"/>

=== Criticism ===

In a skeptical front-page story titled "Weird Babel of Tongues",<ref name="CBNnews"/> a [[Los Angeles Times]] [[reporter]] attempted to describe what would soon be known as the Azusa Street Revival.  "Breathing strange utterances and mouthing a creed which it would seem no sane mortal could understand," the story began, "the newest religious sect has started in Los Angeles."<ref name="CTLibrary">{{cite web | last = Ted | first = Olsen | title = American Pentecost | publisher = ChristianityTodayLibrary.com | date = April 1, 1998 | url = http://ctlibrary.com/4276 | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref>  Another local paper reporter in September, 1906 described the happenings with the following words:

{{Cquote|...disgraceful intermingling of the races<U+2026>they cry and make howling noises all day and into the night. They run, jump, shake all over, shout to the top of their voice, spin around in circles, fall out on the sawdust blanketed floor jerking, kicking and rolling all over it. Some of them pass out and do not move for hours as though they were dead. These people appear to be mad, mentally deranged or under a spell. They claim to be filled with the spirit. They have a one eyed, illiterate, Negro as their preacher who stays on his knees much of the time with his head hidden between the wooden milk crates. He doesn't talk very much but at times he can be heard shouting, <U+2018>Repent,<U+2019> and he's supposed to be running the thing... They repeatedly sing the same song, <U+2018>The Comforter Has Come.<U+2019><ref name="Azusa History"/>}}

The attenders of the meetings were often described as "Holy Rollers," "Holy Jumpers," "Tangled Tonguers" and "Holy Ghosters."  Reports were published throughout the US and the world of the strange happenings in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name="700club"/>
[[Image:026 la times.gif|left|thumb|280px|[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]] article criticizing the behavior of the revivalists at Azusa Street.]]
Christians from many traditions were critical, saying the movement was hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit.<ref name="Washingtonpost"/>  Within a short time ministers were warning their congregations to stay away from the Azusa Street Mission.  Some called the police and tried to get the building shut down.<ref name="centuryoftheholyspirit"/>  Scholarly preachers spoke harshly of the revival meetings; such as [[Reuben Archer Torrey|R. A. Torrey]] who declared that this new Pentecostal movement was "emphatically not of God, and founded by a Sodomite."   G. Campbell Morgan called it, "the last vomit of Satan." [[Harry A. Ironside|Harry Ironside]] said it was "disgusting ... delusions and insanities."  Clarence Larkin and many others were also openly critical.  By the time the revival ended, it was thought by some that it was the result of [[spiritualism]]. This was thought due to the fact that many occultists and spiritists attended the meetings and were comfortable in their midst.<ref name="Let us Reason"/>

=== Apostolic Faith publication ===
[[Image:031 apostolic faith.gif|right|thumb|300px|Headline of the first ever publication of the ''Apostolic Faith'', from [[September]], [[1906]].]]
Also starting in September, [[1906, was the publication of the revival's own newsletter, the ''Apostolic Faith''.<ref name="Latterrain">{{cite web | title = Azusa Street Mission | publisher = The Latter Rain Page | url = http://latter-rain.com/eccle/azusa.htm | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref>  Issues were published occasionally up until May of [[1908]], mostly through the work of Seymour and a [[White (race)|white]] woman named Clara Lum,<ref name="Azusa Street Revival"/> a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission.  The ''Apostolic Faith'' was distributed without charge and thousands of laypersons and ministers received copies worldwide.  5000 copies of the first edition were printed, and by [[1907]] the press run reached over 40,000.<ref name="Enrichment Journal"/><ref name="Azusa History"/><ref name="father">{{cite web | title = William Joseph Seymour: The father of Pentecostalism | Azusa Street: The Impact | date = April 17, 2001 | url = http://spider.georgetowncollege.edu/HTALLANT/courses/his338/students/asample/WJSASIMP.htm | accessdate = May 17, 2007 }}</ref>

The ''Apostolic Faith'' publication reported the happenings at the Azusa Street Mission to the world. Its first issue's lead story was titled "Pentecost has Come".  It contained a letter from [[Charles Parham]], an article on [[Pentecost]] from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and a series of anecdotes of people's experience within the revival.<ref name="Reprint">{{Citation | title = Page 1 Reprint | url = http://www.dunamai.com/Azusa/azusa_Newspapers/1edition.htm
  | accessdate = June 28, 2007 }}</ref>  One edition in 1907 wrote, "One token of the Lord<U+2019>s coming is that He is melting all races and nations together, and they are filled with the power and glory of God. He is baptizing by one spirit into one body and making up a people that will be ready to meet Him when He comes."<ref name="Azusa History"/>  The ''Apostolic Faith'' brought increasing attention to the happenings at Azusa Street and the fledgling movement that was emerging from the revival.<ref name="father"/>

== Legacy ==

By [[1913]], the revival at Azusa Street had lost momentum, and by 1915 most of the media attention and crowds had left.  Seymour remained there with his wife, Jennie, for the rest of their lives as pastors of the small [[African American]] congregation,<ref name="Let us Reason"/> though he often made short trips to help establish other smaller revivals later in life.  After Seymour died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]<ref name="charismaticcentury"/> on September 28, [[1922]], Jennie led the church until [[1931]], when the congregation lost the building.<ref name="blackapostles"/>

The building was torn down and replaced by what became the Japanese-American Cultural and Community Center in Los Angeles after it lost its foreclosure in [[1938]].<ref name="dictionary"/>  Seymour is now considered by modern Pentecostals to be of marginal importance to their movement, with more credit being given to [[Charles Parham]] and other [[White (race)|white]] leaders of his time.<ref name="Azusa Street Timeline"/>  Historians, however, attribute the beginning of the movement to Seymour.<ref name="blackapostles"/>

=== Sending of missionaries ===

As ''The Apostolic Faith'' and many [[secular]] publications advertised the events of the Azusa Street Revival internationally, thousands of individuals visited the Mission in order to wittness it firsthand.  At the same time, thousands of people were leaving Azusa Street with the intentions of [[Evangelism|evangelizing]] abroad.<ref name="Let us Reason"/><ref name="CBNnews"/>   

Reverend K. E. M. Spooner visited the revival on Azusa Street in [[1909]] and became one of the Pentecostal Holiness Church<U+2019>s most effective missionaries in Africa, working among the [[Tswana]] people of [[Botswana]].<ref name="IPHC"/><ref name="spooner">{{cite web | title = REVEREND JOHN W. BROOKS | publisher = Mighty Moments | url = http://www.mightymoments.com/Author.htm | accessdate = May 21, 2007 }}</ref>  A. G. Garr and his wife were sent from Azusa Street as missionaries to [[Calcutta, India]], where they managed to start a small revival.   Speaking in tongues in India did not enable them to speak the native language, [[Bengali language|Bengali]].  Garr significantly contributed to early [[Pentecostalism]] through is later work in redefining the "biblical evidence" doctrine and changing the doctrine from a belief that speaking in tongues was explicitly for evangelism to a belief that speaking in tongues was a gift for "spiritual empowerment".<ref name="charismaticcentury"/>

Missionary Bernt Bernsten traveled all the way from [[North China]] to investigate the happenings after hearing that the Biblical prophecy of Acts 2:4 was being fulfilled.  Other visitors left the revival to become [[Missionary|missionaries]] in remote areas all over the world.<ref name="Azusa History"/><ref name="Azusa Street Revival"/>  So many missionaries went out from Azusa (some thirty-eight left in October 1906) that within two years the movement had spread to over fifty nations, including [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], [[Holland]], [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine]], [[South Africa]], [[Hong Kong]], [[China]], [[Ceylon]] and [[India]].  Christian leaders visited from all over the world.<ref name="racism"/>

=== Birth of Pentecostal movement ===
[[Image:Azusa street group photo.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The leaders of the Apostolic Faith Mission.  Seymour is front row, second from the right; Jenny is back row, third from left.]]
By the end of 1906, most leaders from Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These missions were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups.  The Southeast [[United States]] was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for charismatic spiritual climate that had already been taking root in those areas.  Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy.  Nearly all of these new churches were founded among [[immigrant]]s and the [[Poverty|poor]].<ref name="Azusa Street Timeline"/>

Doctrinal differences abounded, and many separate organizations and denominations sprung from the initial revivals.  The [[Church of God in Christ]] was formed in 1907, the [[Assemblies of God]] and [[United Pentecostal Church]] were formed in [[1914]], the [[Pentecostal Church of God]] was formed in [[1919]] at the Sharon Bible School (which later became a starting point of [[William Branham]]'s ministry in the late [[1940's]]).<ref name="Let us Reason"/>
