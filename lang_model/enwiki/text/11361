'''''Interior''''' ({{lang-fr|Int<U+00E9>rieur}}), also known as '''''The Rape''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Viol}}), is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by [[Edgar Degas]] (1834<U+2013>1917), painted in 1868<U+2013>1869. Described as "the most puzzling of Degas's major works",<ref>Reff 1976, p. 200.</ref> it depicts a tense confrontation by lamplight between a man and a partially undressed woman. The theatrical character of the scene has led art historians to seek a literary source for the composition, but none of the sources proposed has met with universal acceptance. Even the painting's title is uncertain; acquaintances of the artist referred to it either as ''Le Viol'' or ''Int<U+00E9>rieur'', and it was under the latter title that Degas exhibited it for the first time in 1905.<ref name="Kramer" /> The painting is housed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/82556.html?mulR=16058|2 Object record] in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's online collection.</ref>

==Background==
Degas painted ''Interior'' at a time when his growing commitment to [[Realist visual arts|Realism]] had led him away from his earlier preoccupation with historical subjects such as ''S<U+00E9>miramis Building Babylon'' (1860<U+2013>62), ''[[Young Spartans Exercising]]'' (ca.1860), and the painting which marked his [[Paris Salon|Salon]] debut, ''Scene of War in the Middle Ages'' (1865). His new direction was apparent by the time he exhibited ''Steeplechase<U+2014>The Fallen Jockey'' in the Salon of 1866. Degas probably intended to submit ''Interior'' for exhibition in the Salon of 1869,<ref>Thomson p. 68.</ref> but it was not shown publicly until June 1905, when it was displayed at [[Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in Paris.<ref name="Kramer">Kr<U+00E4>mer 2007.</ref>
Degas referred to the work in 1897 as "mon tableau de genre" ("my [[genre works|genre]] painting"), which suggests that he considered the painting anomalous among his works.<ref name="Kramer" />

==Interpretation==
''Interior'' has been described as "the most theatrical of all Degas's compositions of modern life".<ref name="GordonForge">Gordon and Forge 1988, p. 113.</ref> Art historians have written of the work's "distinctly stage-managed character: items are arranged as if they are props, while the dramatic lighting increases the impression that a play is being enacted ... In addition to the mysterious subject-matter, this stage-like effect is presumably one of the chief reasons why scholars have repeatedly tried to identify a literary source for the painting."<ref name="Kramer" /> Various [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] novels have been put forward for consideration. Georges Rivi<U+00E8>re, a friend of the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], first suggested [[Louis Edmond Duranty]]'s novel, ''the Struggle of Francoise Duquesnoy'', as a source; the idea was accepted by R.H. Wilenski and others but found unsatisfactory by Duranty experts.<ref>Reff 1976, p. 202.</ref> Later, a scene within [[<U+00C9>mile Zola]]'s ''Madeleine F<U+00E9>rat'' was identified as matching the elements of Degas's painting in several particulars<U+2014>but while the narrow bed and the round table corresponded, the position of the figures relative to each other did not.<ref>Reff 1976, p. 203.</ref>

In 1976, art historian Theodore Reff published his conjecture that ''Interior'' depicts a scene from Zola's novel ''[[Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Raquin]]''.<ref>Reff 1976, p. 204.</ref> This idea has been widely, but not universally, accepted by other scholars.<ref name="Kramer" />
''Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se Raquin'', published in 1867, tells the story of a young orphan whose aunt has forced her to marry her sickly son, Camille Raquin. Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se enters into an affair with one of Camille's friends, Laurent, and the two carry out a plot to murder Camille, staging the death to look like an accident. Later, on their wedding night, Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se and Laurent find their relationship poisoned by guilt.

The passage that has been deemed to correspond closely to the scene depicted by Degas occurs at the beginning of Chapter 21 of Zola's novel:

<blockquote>Laurent carefully closed the door behind him and remained there a moment, leaning against it, staring into the room with an anxious, confused expression.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A bright fire was burning in the grate, casting golden patches that danced over the ceiling and the walls. The room was thus illuminated by a brilliant, vacillating glow which dimmed the lamp set on a table. Madame Raquin had tried to arrange the room attractively, all white and scented, as though to serve as a nest for young lovers; the old shopkeeper had chosen to add to the bed a few bits of lace and to fill the vases on the mantel with big bouquets of roses. A gentle warmth lingered in the air, with soft odors. </blockquote>
<blockquote>...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se was sitting in a low chair, to the right of the fireplace. Chin in hand, she was staring fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged petticoat and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Laurent took a few steps, not speaking. He removed his jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his trembling lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.<ref name="GordonForge" /></blockquote>

Reff attributed certain elements in the painting that are not mentioned in the text (e.g., the sewing box, and the corset on the floor) to artistic license, and perhaps the influence of a second literary text.<ref>Reff 1976, pp. 205-206.</ref>

[[File:Lorettes no. 5 (lithograph by Paul Gavarni).jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Gavarni]], ''Les Lorettes'', plate 5, lithograph published in ''Le Charivari'', October 2, 1841]]
In 2007, Felix Kr<U+00E4>mer published an article in which he took issue with Reff's conclusions. In particular, Kr<U+00E4>mer wrote of the "critical" discrepancy between the marital bedroom described by Zola and the narrow, single bed in the painting; in addition, the placement of the man's top hat on the bureau in the background suggests that the man has not just entered the room, as Laurent has in the passage quoted above.<ref name="Kramer" />

Kr<U+00E4>mer instead proposed as the "most obvious source" of Degas's composition a [[lithograph]] by [[Paul Gavarni]]: sheet number five from the ''Lorettes'' series, published in 1841 in ''[[Le Charivari]]''. Gavarni was an artist greatly admired by Degas, who amassed a collection of some 2,000 of Gavarni's lithographs.<ref name="Kramer" /> Points of similarity between the print and ''Interior'' are described by Kr<U+00E4>mer: <blockquote>As in Degas's ''Le Viol'', [the woman] has her back turned towards the man who stands in front of the door, his legs spread wide and his hands in his pockets. From above, as if contemplating his prize, his gaze is fixed on the woman who, significantly, is seated on an animal-skin rug. Not only is the man's posture reminiscent of Degas's painting, but the woman is also in a comparable pose, her right hand raised to her head, her garment sliding off her shoulder. Even the pictures on the wall and the discarded clothes on the sofa could have inspired Degas.<ref name="Kramer" /></blockquote>

Gavarni's print depicts a [[prostitute]]; the title ''Lorettes'' is a reference to the [[Paris]] neighborhood of Notre-Dame de la Lorette, home to many prostitutes. As described in 1841 by Maurice Alhoy in ''Physiologie de la Lorette'', these women lived in hotels and carried their few belongings in small suitcases, always including a sewing kit which was indispensable as the means by which  the "''Lorettes''" maintained their appearance.<ref name="Kramer" /> According to Kr<U+00E4>mer, the prominence given the sewing box in ''Interior'', together with indications of blood on the bed,  bolster the case that ''Interior'' is a scene depicting prostitution and the aftermath of sexual violence, rather than marital discord.<ref name="Kramer" />

==Influence==
The influence of ''Interior'' has been noted in the compositions of Degas's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> [[Walter Sickert]], specifically in the latter's ''[[The Camden Town Murder]]'' series of 1908,<ref>Baron, Wendy; Shone, Richard, et al. (1992). ''Sickert Paintings'', p. 208. New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]]. ISBN 0-300-05373-8]</ref> and his painting ''Ennui'' of 1914. In a conversation with Sickert, Degas described ''Interior'' as a genre painting, and as in the older artist's example, Sickert's depictions of men and women together are marked by dramatic tension and narrative ambiguity.<ref>Robins, Anna Gruetzner; Thomson, Richard, (2005). ''Degas, Sickert, and Toulouse-Lautrec: London and Paris, 1870-1910'', pp.196-199. London: [[Tate]] Publishing. ISBN 1-85437-634-9</ref>
