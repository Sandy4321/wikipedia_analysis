'''No.&nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School''' (No.&nbsp;2 EFTS) was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) pilot training unit that operated during World War&nbsp;II. It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. No.&nbsp;2 EFTS was established in November 1939 as '''No.&nbsp;3 Flying Training School''' at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland, and partially utilised aircraft and facilities of the civilian air training organisations based there. The school was renamed No.&nbsp;2 EFTS in January 1940. It was disbanded in March 1942, and its operations transferred to [[No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;5 Elementary Flying School]] at [[RAAF Station Narromine|Narromine]], New South Wales, and [[No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;11 Elementary Flying School]] at [[Benalla Airport|Benalla]], Victoria.

==History==
Flying instruction in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, in response to the commencement of Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria, was supplanted in 1940<U+2013>41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).<ref name=Stephens67>Stephens (2006), pp. 67<U+2013>70</ref><ref>[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.PDF Gillison (1962), p. 111]</ref> The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying), which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.<ref name=Stephens67/><ref>[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.PDF Gillison (1962), pp. 106<U+2013>109]</ref>

No.&nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School was formed as No.&nbsp;3 Flying Training School at [[RAAF Station Archerfield|Archerfield]], Queensland, on 6&nbsp;November 1939.<ref name=Gillison72>[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070476--1-.PDF Gillison (1962), p. 72]</ref><ref name=Units>RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 17</ref> Its inaugural commanding officer was [[Flight Lieutenant]] T.C. Curnow.<ref name=Units/> Archerfield was home to private aviation clubs and schools including the Queensland Aero Club and Airwork Ltd, and it was the airfield's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the second flying school the RAAF raised during World War&nbsp;II. The same principle was followed in establishing No.&nbsp;2 Flying Training School (later renamed [[No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School]]) at [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]], South Australia, [[No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[Essendon Airport|Essendon]], Victoria, and [[No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Station Mascot|Mascot]], New South Wales.<ref name=Gillison72/>

No.&nbsp;3 Flying Training School was renamed No.&nbsp;2 Elementary Flying Training School on 2&nbsp;January 1940.<ref name=Gillison72/><ref name=Units/> Its first fifteen [[de&nbsp;Havilland Tiger Moth]] training aircraft were delivered three days later. These were augmented by privately owned Tiger Moths and [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moths]] pressed into military service.<ref name=Units/> The first training course, lasting eight weeks, began on 10&nbsp;January; twenty-one students graduated.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), pp. 135, 142</ref> By the end of the month, the school's strength included 105 officers and men, 1 civilian instructor, and 26 students. The unit log book reported several deficiencies, specifically the lack of hangars, teaching materials, and basic infrastructure including hot water, a kitchen, and a telephone system.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), p. 134</ref> A second civilian instructor, from the Queensland Aero Club, joined the school on 12&nbsp;February 1940.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), p. 141</ref> Later that month, No.&nbsp;2 EFTS was among the units assigned to the control of the proposed [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]], which was eventually formed in May 1941. In the interim, all units in Queensland came under the control of Central Area Command, headquartered in [[Sydney]].<ref>Ashworth (2000), pp. 31<U+2013>35</ref><ref>[http://static.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070724--1-.PDF Gillison (1962), pp. 91<U+2013>92]</ref>

The school's inaugural EATS course consisted of thirty-one students, who arrived at Archerfield on 29&nbsp;April 1940; twenty-four of the students graduated.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45),  p. 156</ref> The second EATS course commenced on 27&nbsp;June; eighteen of the twenty-four students graduated.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), p. 158</ref> As of 15&nbsp;July, responsibility for all aircraft maintenance at the school was assigned to the Queensland Aero Club.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), p. 157</ref> Squadron Leader [[Roy Phillipps]], a [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] with the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in World War&nbsp;I, assumed command of No.&nbsp;2 EFTS on 20&nbsp;October 1940. Phillipps died on 21&nbsp;May 1941, when a private plane in which he was a passenger crashed after taking off from Archerfield.<ref>Garrisson (1999), pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref><ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), pp. 167, 199</ref> Operations at No.&nbsp;2 EFTS were increased twofold in August 1941; by 30&nbsp;September its strength included 202 officers and men, 1 civilian, and 91 trainees.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), pp. 212, 217</ref> Cross-country exercises could take students as far as [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] and [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]].<ref name=Units/> Training accidents at the school were frequent, particularly from heavy landings, but did not result in any fatalities.<ref name=Units/>

EATS training was put on hold in January 1942, following the outbreak of [[Pacific War|war in the Pacific]], but resumed the next month.<ref>Royal Australian Air Force (1939<U+2013>45), pp. 225, 227</ref> Owing to urgent requirements to house other RAAF units and elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), No.&nbsp;2 EFTS was disbanded on 31&nbsp;March 1942, and its operations transferred to [[No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;5 Elementary Flying School]] at [[RAAF Station Narromine|Narromine]], New South Wales, and [[No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;11 Elementary Flying School]] at [[Benalla Airport|Benalla]], Victoria.<ref name=Units/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=166516|title=Formation, Organisation & Movement&nbsp;<U+2013> No. 1 Flying Training School|author=[[Department of Air (Australia)|Department of Air]]|date=1941<U+2013>47|page= 71|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref> By the time it closed, No.&nbsp;2 EFTS had trained 806 EATS students, 610 of whom had gone on to SFTSs.<ref name=Units/>
