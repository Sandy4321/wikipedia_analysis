Professor '''Harold Arthur Harris''' (27 October 1902 &ndash; 29 August 1974) was educated at Oxford High School, and went on to study at [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. Here, he gained a first in Classical Moderations, becoming a senior scholar, and graduating with first class honours in English.

After graduation, Harris gained his teaching certificate, and in 1926 he was appointed Lecturer in [[Classics]] and English at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|St David's College]], [[Lampeter]]. In 1934, he was made Professor of [[Classics]], taking responsibility for English during the [[Second World War]]. He remained in the post until his retirement in 1968.

Harris was responsible for a great deal of teaching at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|Lampeter]]. All St David's students were, at this time, expected to study [[Greek language|Greek]] for two years. Simultaneously, the numbers wishing to study English at the college were increasing. This left little time for his personal research interests. Yet he did manage to publish various books and articles, including ''Greek Athletes and Athletics'' in 1964, and ''Sport in Greece and Rome'' in 1968. These aroused great interest worldwide, and resulted in countless invitations to lecture on the subject.

Harris took a great interest in sport himself, particularly [[cricket]]. He possessed a vast knowledge of English County and Test cricketers, and was involved with the [[Lampeter]] [[First eleven|XI]]. He also took a prominent role in many college dramatic productions. He visited [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] on an annual basis, being prevented only during the war years. These visits resulted in him being made a senior lecturer on the official Greek cruise tours. He died suddenly at [[Oxford]] in 1974.

A hall of residence at St David's College, which is now the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]], is named for Harris.
