'''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007''' is an Indian Television singing competition that premiered on [[4 May]], [[2007]]. It is the 2<sup>nd</sup> installment of the "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge" series and the 4<sup>th</sup> public voting competition in the "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa" series. Chronologically, the show is preceded by [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L'il Champs]], however systematically it is followed by [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005]]. The show features two of the previous mentors, [[Himesh Reshammiya]] and [[Ismail Darbar]], and two new mentors to the Challenge series, [[Bappi Lahiri]] and [[Vishal-Shekhar]]. [[Shaan]] did not return to host and was replaced by [[Aditya Narayan]], son of [[playback singer]], [[Udit Narayan]]. 

== Concept ==
Like other singing competitions, the concept of this season of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa was to discover singing talent. However, this time the show had also targeted hidden talent outside [[India]]. With [[Zee TV]] being broadcast internationally via satellite, it was an attempt that promised more viewers of the show and definite success. 

This time round, the idea was to conduct auditions all over the world and select the top singers from different regions who would then compete against each other on stage in front of hundreds of thousands of television viewers. The initial rounds were judged by notable artistes from the Indian music industry as well as the mentors who subsequently selected the top 14 finalists. Currently, the finalists are performing in each episode with the goal of being the winner of the season which all depends on public voting.

== Broadcast schedule ==
Beginning in mid-[[March 2007]], [[Zee News]] aired audition clips of the upcoming season. The short news feature presented some of the judges opinions, short clips of contestants auditioning and audition date details.

The season's pilot episodes began as a two-night, one-hour premiere that aired on [[4 May]] and [[5 May]], [[2007]] at 10:30 p.m. (UTC +5:30) in India and 6:00 p.m. (UTC -7:00) on Canada's [[ATN Channel]]. Starting the following week, regular scheduled hours of the program aired on Fridays and Saturdays.

[[Zee TV]]'s SRGMP 2007 is also in competition with the 3<sup>rd</sup> season of [[Sony Entertainment Television]]'s [[Indian idol 3|Indian Idol]] which also premiered on the same date and [[Star Plus]]'s [[Star Voice of India]] which premiered three weeks later.

The production of each episode is filmed 5 days earlier than the broadcast date. <ref>{{cite web

== Regional auditions phase ==
===Locations===
[[Image:ADU-SRGMP.jpg|thumb|250px|Current host, [[Aditya Narayan]], who replaced [[Shaan]].]]
The Auditions were held in the following cities in [[India]] each between the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. :
*[[Indore]]: Ravindra Natya Grih, 1, RNT Mar - [[13 March]]
*[[Ludhiana]]: Satluj Club - [[13 March]]
*[[Jaipur]]: RoRavindra Manch, Ram Nivas Baug - [[14 March]]
*[[Ahmedabad]]: Dinesh Hall, Ashram Road, Navrangpura - [[15 March]]
*[[Guwahati]]: Prachees Kingdom - [[16 March]]
*[[Lucknow]]: Gandhi Bhawan - [[19 March]]
*[[Mumbai]]: Andheri Sports Complex, J.P. Road, Andheri West - [[19 March]]
*[[New Delhi]]: S.G.T.B. Khalsa College, North Campus - [[25 March]]
*[[Kolkata]]: Salt Lake Stadium - [[27 March]]

The Auditions were held in the following countries internationally:
*[[United States|America]]: judged by [[Bappi Lahiri]]
*[[Dubai]], [[U.A.E.]]: judged by [[Ismail Darbar]]
*[[Johannesburg]]: judged by [[Vishal-Shekhar]]
*[[London]], [[England]]: judged by [[Himesh Reshammiya]]
*[[Pakistan]]: judged by [[Ghulam Ali]] - [[30 March]]

Auditioning contestants were strictly required to provide proof of their age of being between the ages 18 and 28 on [[March 2007]] (born between [[1979|March 1979]] and [[March 1989]]).

===Structure of auditions===
Auditions for the show were held in the cities shown above. As shown in the pilot episode, the 2007 process was very chaotic, especially in India: contestants waited in long lines and large crowds and people jumped fences and lines to get a chance at auditioning. Although for the first time, the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa series did not begin the show with an episode of the audition clips, the majority of them were rejected leaving only 16 final contestants chosen from India that performed on the pilot episode.

==Gharanas==
[[Image:Vishal-Shekhar-SRGMP.jpg|thumb|250px|The introduction of Vishal and Shekhar]]

The '''''Gharana''''' ([[Hindi]]: <U+0918><U+0921><U+093C><U+093E><U+0923><U+093E> ghaRaaNaa, literally "House") is utilised similarly to a [[House system]] used in [[schools]] and [[colleges]]. The contestants of the gharanas have been chosen  by the mentors themselves. 

Two of the four previous gharanas that were featured on [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005]] have been replaced - [[Aadesh Shrivastava]]'s Jai Ho and [[Jatin-Lalit]]'s Dum have now been replaced with "Josh" and "Hit Squad".

The '''exact purpose''' of this Gharana was not mentioned during the initial days of the show but soon it was determined that it basically prevented a Gharana to get eliminated in the initial rounds. The contestants in this Eklavya Gharana performed on the 2<sup>nd</sup> episode of the show. Later on, each week two contestants from this Gharana were chosen to join a mentor's Gharana after that mentor has had any of his contestants eliminated the previous week.

==Bramhastra== 
The "Bramhastra" round ran through Week 9. This round basically allowed the public to bring an eliminated contestant back into the competition. The gharana who received the Bramhastra got to choose two eliminated contestants for the finals (Agnipariksha). [[Vishal-Shekhar]] received this Bramhastra and they chose 6 contestants. The six contestants were:

*Sarika Singh (Hit Squad) 
*Sunil Kumar (Josh)
*Raja Hasan (Hit Squad)
*Saaberi Bhattacharya (Hit Squad)
*Harpreet Deol (Josh)
*Desh Gaurav Singh (Yalgaar)

Out of the six contestants that were chosen by Vishal-Shekhar, the two contestants who got the majority of the votes from the public and subsequently elected and brought back into the competition were:
*Raja Hasan who attained 31% of the votes
*Harpreet Deol who attained 20% of the votes

==Top 14 Finalists==
The 14 finalists were announced at the end of the episode broadcast on [[June 29]], [[2007]]. This year, Aneek Dhar and Abhijeet Kosambi who were winners of the regional spinoffs, ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Bangla'' and ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Marathi'', got direct entry as finalists. Their direct entry into the finals caused some controversy that was brought to attention by Ismail Darbar.

In the Agnipariksha round, eliminations are based on public voting. Public voting is done through [[SMS]], telephone or online. Each week, the contestant with lowest votes is eliminated.

Additionally, if all the contestants of a Gharana get eliminated, the Gharana also gets eliminated and subsequently the mentor(s) have to leave the show.

==Aneek-Abhijit controversy==
On [[June 29]], Aditya Narayan announced that Aneek Dhar and Abhijeet Kosambi, the winners of the regional spinoffs of ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Bangla'' and ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Marathi'', would be getting direct entry as a Top 14 finalist. The mentors did not approve of this saying they should not be allowed to enter the competition in the middle and that they should have come from the beginning. Ismail Darbar tried to walk away from the show stalling the shooting of the program. After three hours of attempting to convince the mentors, the mentors had finally said that [[Zee TV]] should decide what should be done.

The next day, [[Zee TV]] came to a conclusion that the two contestants would be sorted in any of the three gharanas by using the lottery system. However, next week Ismail Darbar had brought up the issue again stating that [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] have had three consecutive wins in the [[Cricket World Cup]], but the team still cannot come directly into the finals in the next World Cup. Furthermore, he says that Amanat Ali was also the winner of the regional spinoff, ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Middle East-Pakistan Challenge 2007'', however Ali did not get a direct entry like Dhar and Kosambi.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=July 2007}}
* The new logo is significantly different from the "[[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005]]" logo featuring [[headphones]] on the [[globe]] instead of a portrayal of duet singing. The likely reason for this is because the show wants to represent itself as an international competition.
*According to facts, there are six not four Pakistanis taking part in the competition unlike as shown on the show. The other two Pakistanis who got selected apart from the original Pakistani screening are Imran Aslam from South Africa whose hometown is [[Karachi]] {{cn}} and Amanat Ali from U.A.E. who hails from [[Faisalabad]] <ref>{{cite web
