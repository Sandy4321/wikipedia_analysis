'''''Perfect Dark''''' is a 2000 [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] [[game console]]. The game was developed and published by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], creators of the multimillion-selling ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', an earlier first-person shooter with which ''Perfect Dark'' shares many gameplay features. This game is also considered the [[spiritual successor]] to ''GoldenEye 007''. The game was first released in Canada and the United States in May 2000, where it was greeted with critical acclaim; [[PAL Region|PAL]] and [[NTSC-J]] releases followed soon afterwards.

The game features a single-player mode consisting of seventeen missions in which the player assumes the role of [[special agent]] [[Joanna Dark]], an operative for the fictional Carrington Institute, as she attempts to foil a conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. It also includes a range of multiplayer options, including co-operative and "counter-operative" modes in addition to traditional [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] settings. Technically, it is one of the most advanced games developed for the N64, with optional high-[[Image resolution|resolution]] graphics and [[Dolby]] [[Surround Sound]].

In September 2000, a separate game starring agent Joanna Dark, also titled ''Perfect Dark'', was released for the [[Game Boy Color]]. Although set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]], it follows a separate storyline. With the use of the [[Transfer Pak]], the Game Boy game allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 version to be unlocked. ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]'', a prequel to ''Perfect Dark'' also developed by Rare, was a launch title for the [[Xbox 360]] in 2005. ''[[Perfect Dark: Initial Vector]]'', a novel by [[Greg Rucka]], was published later that year. A second novel, ''[[Perfect Dark: Second Front]]'', followed in 2007.

==Storyline==
''Perfect Dark'' is set in the year 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble the stereotypical "[[greys]]" of alien abduction folklore, and the Skedar, [[reptile]]-like [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s who can disguise themselves as humans, bearing similarities to [[Nordic aliens]].

On Earth, there is an on-going rivalry between two factions. The Carrington Institute, founded by Daniel Carrington, is officially an [[research and development|R&amp;D]] centre but secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians. dataDyne, on the other hand, is a sinister defense contractor with a clandestine link to the Skedar. The player is cast as [[Joanna Dark]], a new recruit to the Carrington Institute whose impeccable scores in training have earned her the codename "Perfect Dark". 
[[Image:Perfectdark3.jpg|thumb|left|Maian alien as depicted in the Maian SOS solo level.]]<!-- FAIR USE of Perfectdark3.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Perfectdark3.jpg for rationale -->
The game begins with her mission to investigate suspicious reports from a dataDyne insider. In the process, she uncovers a conspiracy between dataDyne and the Skedar: the Skedar plan to steal an alien "[[planet killer|megaweapon]]" from a crashed spacecraft on the Earth's ocean floor and use it to annihilate the Maians. When the [[List of fictional United States Presidents|President of the United States]] refuses to loan dataDyne the research vessel they need to retrieve the megaweapon, they plot to kill him and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. Unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Skedar also intend to test-fire the megaweapon on the Earth, destroying it in the process.

With the help of other Carrington agents and a Maian nicknamed Elvis, Joanna prevents the conspiracy by causing the weapon to self-destruct. The Skedar launch a retaliatory strike on the Carrington Institute, capturing Joanna. Elvis rescues her from a Skedar assault ship. Joanna then helps the Maians launch a counter-attack, destroying the Skedar's "Battle Shrine" and eliminating their High Priest, thereby issuing Skedar morale a crippling blow.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:PerfectDarkscreen1.jpg|left|thumb|Screenshot from the first level of ''Perfect Dark''.]]<!-- FAIR USE of PerfectDarkscreen1.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:PerfectDarkscreen1.jpg for rationale --> 
''Perfect Dark'' features many elements that are typical of a first-person shooter game, including a range of weapons to collect, enemies to defeat and distinct environments to explore. It is frequently described as a "[[spiritual sequel]]" to Rare's earlier first-person shooter ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', released in 1997. Although ''Perfect Dark'' is not set in the [[James Bond]] universe, the gameplay is extremely similar and it retains many of its predecessor's features, such as the ability to use [[wiktionary:stealth|stealth]] to tackle missions, and objectives that vary with the difficulty setting. 

The weapons of ''Perfect Dark'' include [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, a [[shotgun]], [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], [[combat knife|combat knives]], [[grenade launcher]]s, various [[explosives]], and several fictitious extraterrestrial weapons. Almost all of the weapons in the game have two modes of fire: a primary mode in which the weapon is used in a typical fashion, and a secondary mode which tends to use the weapon in a more unconventional manner, such as [[pistol-whipping]] or proximity detonation. Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, and certain guns can be used [[Akimbo (gaming)|in duplicate]], one in each hand. Unlike in ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', where the guns were simply dipped below vision during reloading, ''Perfect Dark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s weapons all feature unique and visible reload sequences. 

===Solo mode===
[[Image:Goldeneye-in-perfect-dark.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Some weapons from ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'' are unlockable extras in ''Perfect Dark''. The PP7 pistol from ''GoldenEye 007'' (pictured left) was renamed the PP9i for ''Perfect Dark'' (right).]]
The player can explore the Carrington Institute and take part in a number of tutorials and training activities. The most substantial of these activities is the [[Shooting range|firing range]], in which the player's proficiency with each of the game's weapons is tested against specific targets. Completing these trials unlocks so-called "Classic Weapons", which are taken from ''GoldenEye 007''.<ref>[http://perfectdark.detstar.com/firingrange/index.asp detStar] guide to the firing range. Retrieved on [[2006-06-11]]</ref>The classic weapons are practically the same as their GoldenEye counterparts, except for a light naming change.  For instance, Goldeneye's Klobb is named the Klo1313.

In ''Perfect Dark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s solo missions, the player controls Joanna through a series of [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] collected together into missions. In each level, the player must complete certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery and use of numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again.

There are three distinct difficulty levels in the single-player game: Agent, Special Agent and Perfect Agent. There are a number of differences between the difficulty levels, including the objectives that must be completed, the amount of ammunition available, and enemy accuracy and damage. On higher difficulties, the optional "auto-aiming", in which the game corrects slight aiming errors automatically, becomes less effective and bonus items such as protective shields are absent. Once the game has been completed on one difficulty level, the levels can be tackled in any order on the other difficulties (apart from the final mission of the main story arc, which can only be played at a given difficulty after all other missions have been beaten on that difficulty). If all the levels are completed on Perfect Agent difficulty, an additional setting becomes available; titled Perfect Dark, this mode allows the player to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict.<ref name="IGNreview">[http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153906p1.html IGN] review of ''Perfect Dark'', "Features" section. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>

Four bonus missions may be unlocked by the player. One, "The Duel", is a holographic training simulation against three opponents, and is unlocked by completing all of the entry-level weapon challenges in the firing range. The other three bonus missions are unlocked by completing the game on each of the three standard difficulties, and allow the player to control other characters <U+2014> Elvis, Mr Blonde and a Maian warrior <U+2014> in scenarios parallel to the main narrative.<ref>[http://www.cheatscodesguides.com/nintendo-64-cheats/perfect-dark/ Cheats Codes Guides.com] on the bonus missions.</ref> The gameplay is essentially unchanged, with objectives to accomplish and enemies to battle, but these characters do have some special characteristics, such as Mr Blonde's [[cloaking device]].<ref>[http://perfectdark.detstar.com/solomissions/18blondesrevenge/18blondesrevenge.asp detStar] guide to the level "Mr Blonde's Revenge". Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>

Additionally, the player can unlock [[cheat code|cheats]] by beating the levels within certain time limits. Some cheats, such as "All Weapons", can alternatively be unlocked by using the ''[[Perfect Dark (Game Boy Color)|Perfect Dark]]'' [[Game Boy Color]] game and [[Transfer Pak]]. The cheats range from "Perfect Darkness", which makes the level pitch dark but gives the player a pair of [[night vision goggles]], to more traditional extras such as Infinite Ammo.<ref>[http://uk.cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/003/003906.html IGN] on ''Perfect Dark'' cheats.</ref>

The game includes a co-operative mode in which two players, or one player and up to three computer-controlled players, tackle the missions together. If two humans play, the game uses a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] display, with the option to split horizontally or vertically. Only one human player is required to survive the mission, although all the objectives must still be completed. Finally, there is a "Counter Op" mode, in which one player plays the missions as Joanna while the other takes over the role of an enemy <U+2014> including their weaponry and low health <U+2014> and attempts to stop her. The Counter Op player takes control of another enemy if they are killed, and cannot cause the mission to fail directly by, for example, killing Joanna's allies before she meets them.<ref name="manual">''Perfect Dark'' [[Instruction manual (computer and video games)|manual]].

The solo player areas feature numerous [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter eggs]] and strange objects, areas and glitches to fuel the exploration efforts and wild speculation of many gamers. Rare staff have admitted that some of the oddities in the game were put there "for a laugh", and that the constant barrage of questioning emails they got were sometimes "a free source of amusement".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yamoslair.com/pdrare.html |title= Yamo's Lair |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060512144340/http://www.yamoslair.com/pdrare.html |archivedate=2006-05-12}} on Rare's reason for game's easter eggs.

This idea was scrapped, but the cheese remained.<ref>[http://perfectdark.3dactionplanet.gamespy.com/pd/cheese/ ''GameSpy''] on the original purpose of hidden cheese. Retrieved March 3, 2007.</ref>

===Multiplayer===
The '''Combat Simulator''' is ''Perfect Dark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode. A game can be played with up to four human players and eight computer-controlled players. Again a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary.<ref name="manual" />

Players enter the game unarmed and with a certain amount of health. Weapons and ammunition are scattered around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played, of which there are six:<ref>[http://perfectdark.detstar.com/scenarios/scenarios.asp detStar] on the Combat Simulator scenarios. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>
* '''Combat''' <U+2014> The traditional [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] mode. This can be played in teams.
* '''Capture the Case''' <U+2014> ''Perfect Dark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s equivalent of [[Capture the Flag]].
* '''Hold the Briefcase''' <U+2014> Players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible. One point is received for every set number of seconds the case is held. If the player with the briefcase is killed, they drop the briefcase and it can be picked up by anyone else.
* '''King of the Hill''' <U+2014> One area in the level is "the hill". Points are awarded for locating this region and staying there for a set number of seconds. Having been "captured" in this way, the hill moves to a new location, or if a certain game setting was set, the hill remains in the same spot while the timer resets.
* '''Hacker Central''' <U+2014> Players must locate a data uplink and use it to hack a computer system; both items are randomly placed in the level. The data uplink is moved to a new location when the player carrying it is killed. When hacking the computer system, the player cannot use weapons, and cannot move from the terminal without breaking the link.
* '''Pop a Cap''' <U+2014> Similar to "Assassination" type multiplayer games. One player is labeled as the target, and the other players go after him. If the target kills his hunters, he receives a point bonus. If the hunters kill the target, they receive a point, but they then become the targeted player. The term pop a cap is used in this game in reference to the slang term "pop a cap", which usually means to fire a gun or to participate in gun-wielding activity.

Aspects of each game can be customised, such as the chosen arena, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in ''GoldenEye 007''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s widely acclaimed multiplayer mode. For example, the earlier game only allowed players to specify a pre-set class of weapons, such as "Automatics", but in ''Perfect Dark'', players can individually select the weapons to be included and where each should be located. Shields may be placed in any of the weapon slots or omitted entirely; ''GoldenEye 007''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[body armour]] was fixed in one position for each level.<ref name="manual" />

Computer controlled [[computer game bot|bot]]s, called "Simulants", can be included in the multiplayer game. The appearance, team affiliation, skill level and playing characteristics of each Simulant can be individually customised. For example, the VengeSim always pursues the player that killed it last, the FistSim will not fire guns but will attack with punches and thrown weapons, while the PeaceSim does not fight at all but merely tries to disarm the other players. Simulants can perform super-human feats on the highest difficulty settings, such as moving faster than the player can.<ref>[http://perfectdark.detstar.com/combatsim/simulants.asp detStar] on the Combat Simulator Simulants. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref> During team matches, a human player can issue specific orders to the Simulants on their team, such as "Defend the Base".<ref name="manual" />

The Combat Simulator includes thirty "Challenges", pre-set games against Simulants which may be tackled by one or more players. The Challenges cover a variety of game types, weapon arrangements and level setups. As a player completes them, additional features <U+2014> including new weapons, player models and bot difficulties <U+2014> are unlocked in the Combat Simulator. A complete list of features unlockable through this mode is available; see {{cite web |url=http://perfectdark.detstar.com/challenges/earnings.asp |title=Combat Simulator Challenge Earnings |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061209134830/http://perfectdark.detstar.com/challenges/earnings.asp |archivedate=2006-12-09}}.

At the end of the match, the overall results are shown, alongside information about the individual players' performance. Color-coded "medals" are awarded to the winners in several categories: Accuracy, Head Shots, KillMaster (for achieving the most kills) and Survivor (for suffering the fewest deaths). The game also acknowledges, often humorously, other aspects of performance by awarding messages such as "Best Protected" (for people who frequently use [[body armour]]) and "[[Notable phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Mostly Harmless|Mostly Harmless]]" (for particularly ineffective players).

Players can keep track of their performance by creating and saving multiplayer profiles. Each profile contains a ranking, ranging from "Beginner: 21" to "Perfect: 1", which is determined based on the accumulation of certain statistics such as number of kills, time played and ammunition used. The number of medals earned is also counted. (See [http://speedrunwiki.com/Combat_Simulator_milestones Combat Simulator milestones].) A player achieving the rank of "Perfect: 1" is given the message "Username: [[Entropy|Entropic]] Decay, Password: Zero-[[Tau]]." Rare had originally intended these details to allow access to password-protected parts of the official ''Perfect Dark'' website, but these sections were never implemented.<ref name="RarePBC">[http://www.rarenet.com/wiki/index.php?title=Rare%27s_Official_Response_to_Perfect_Dark_Rumors Rare's] official response to ''Perfect Dark'' rumours. Retrieved December 11, 2005.</ref>

Multiplayer profiles also allow players to customise their in-game appearance by selecting the head and body of any of the game's character models (excluding the Skedar), as well as several which do not appear in the single-player mode. A feature called "Perfect Head", which appeared in previews of the game but was not included in the final product, was intended to take player customisation further. This feature allowed the player to place a photograph of their choice onto their in-game character's face, via a [[Game Boy Camera]] combined with the [[Nintendo 64]] [[Transfer Pak]]. The images taken would be uploaded to the cartridge and manipulated with a simple image editing program to adjust color and skin tone (as the Game Boy Camera was black and white) and add facial features such as facial hair. This texture could then be saved to either the cartridge or a [[Controller Pak]] and then loaded onto a player's character in multiplayer, thus creating a virtual representation of the player. Officially Rare said the feature was dropped due to "technical issues", but it is likely the real reason for the feature's removal was due to "sensitive issues" surrounding the ability to attack images of real people in the wake of the Columbine Massacre.<ref>[http://ign64.ign.com/articles/068/068036p1.html ''IGN64.com''] on the features and implementation of Perfect Head.

==Development==
[[Image:Perfect Dark Japanese Ad.jpg|thumb|While the localized title of ''Red and Black'' was ultimately dropped, Japanese advertisements for ''Perfect Dark'' still kept its dual color theme. Also evident in this ad is that ''Perfect Dark'' could be bought bundled with an [[Expansion Pak]] in Japan; such a bundle was not made available in the American release.]] 

[[Martin Hollis]], the director of ''GoldenEye 007'' and ''Perfect Dark'', described the development of the game in an interview with ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' magazine.<ref name=retrogamer-hollis>"The Legacy of ''Perfect Dark'': Martin Hollis Q&A" {{cite web |url=http://www.retrogamer.net/flashindex.html |title= Retro Gamer |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070813232203/http://www.retrogamer.net/flashindex.html |archivedate=2007-08-13}} issue 19 (January 2006), p. 79. ISSN 1742-3155 </ref> He explained that Rare rejected the prospect of working on the ''GoldenEye'' sequel ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' "without hesitation", as the development team felt they had spent too much time immersed in the James Bond universe. The decision to make the central character a woman was part of Hollis' belief that there "should be more games centred on women". To this end, the team created Joanna Dark, influenced by a number of other fictional heroines: Kim Kimberly from [[Level 9 Computing]]'s [[text adventure]] ''[[Snowball (game)|Snowball]]'', the seductive spy Agent X-27 in the 1930s film ''[[Dishonored]]'',<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021800/ IMDB] on ''Dishonored'' and Agent X-27. Retrieved April 8, 2006.</ref> the eponymous ''[[femme fatale]]'' of the film ''[[Nikita]]'',<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/ IMDB] on ''Nikita''. Retrieved April 8, 2006.</ref> and [[FBI]] agent [[Dana Scully]] from [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. The name "Joanna Dark" was taken from the French pronunciation of [[Joan of Arc]] as "Jeanne d'Arc".

''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a major influence on the character, setting and plot. The name of the in-game company "dataDyne" was inspired by [[Yoyodyne]] from ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]]. Another significant influence on the game's locations was the work of author [[Philip K. Dick]]. Hollis explained that he and designer David Doak "picked a range of locations we thought would be impressive and architectural, on the model of ''GoldenEye'' but sci-fi [[dystopia]]s.<U+2026> The settings came first; the plot was then constructed by Dave to sew them together". The word "Dark" was chosen for its association with the game's bleak focus on killing. Hollis has noted the similarities to [[Criterion Software]]'s naming of ''[[Black (video game)|Black]]'': "Game developers just like black, nihilism, dystopian futures, the number zero, infinity, spheres, perfection<U+2014>all that kind of stuff."  The "double slash" symbol in the game's logo was inspired by the Japanese [[dakuten]] mark.

At one time [[Nintendo|Nintendo of Japan]] considered releasing the game there under the title {{nihongo|''Aka to Kuro''|<U+8D64><U+3068><U+9ED2>||lit. "Red and Black"}}.  "''Perfect Dark''" does not translate well into Japanese, and the title "''Aka to Kuro''" was considered sufficiently edgy.<ref>[http://ign64.ign.com/articles/082/082525p1.html IGN] on the original Japanese title, ''Red and Black''. Retrieved April 7, 2006.</ref>  However, it was eventually released as {{nihongo|<U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30D5><U+30A7><U+30AF><U+30C8><U+30FB><U+30C0><U+30FC><U+30AF>||P<U+0101>fekuto D<U+0101>ku}}, a transliteration of the Western title.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/perfectdark/news_2608740.html "''Perfect Dark'' Returns"].

Originally Hollis hoped that the difference between light and dark would be a significant feature of the gameplay, and the title was  intended to reflect this focus. A [[flashlight|torch]] was implemented by Steve Ellis (responsible for much of the multiplayer mode in ''GoldenEye''<ref name="daviddoak">"Desert Island Disks: David Doak." ''{{cite web |url=http://www.livepublishing.co.uk/retro/ |title= Retro Gamer |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050922002103/http://www.livepublishing.co.uk/retro/ |archivedate=2005-09-22}}'' {{cite web |url=http://www.livepublishing.co.uk/retro/retro6.shtml |title= issue 6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060227223119/http://www.livepublishing.co.uk/retro/retro6.shtml |archivedate=2006-02-27}}(July 2004), pp. 41<U+2013>45. ISSN 1742-3155 </ref>), but it was not included in the final game due to the limitations of the N64 hardware (see [[#Game engine|Game engine]] section). Hollis remarked that such aims were overambitious: "Even today, you can see game developers struggle to make light and dark foundational from a gameplay perspective. I suspect it will take a few years before significant and pervasive gameplay innovation occurs here." Although not all these intended features were realised, the game does contain more advanced lighting than ''GoldenEye''; [[light bulb|lights]] can be shot out, gunfire illuminates rooms, and the player can use [[Night vision#Thermal vision|infra-red]] and [[night vision goggles]].

Martin Hollis was involved with ''Perfect Dark'' for the first fourteen months of its three-year development, during which progress was slow. David Doak left at the end of 1998, and Steve Ellis soon after, to form [[Free Radical Design]]. What followed by those remaining on the project was a comprehensive re-design of the game (the story and characters being the main items kept intact). Hollis stated that he was impressed by the comprehensive range of multiplayer options, saying "what a vast array of features I never planned". Doak, however, remarked, "''GoldenEye'' pretty much exhausted the performance of the machine. It was hard to push it further. ''Perfect Dark'' had some good ideas but was dog slow."<ref name="daviddoak" />

==Game engine==
The ''Perfect Dark'' [[game engine|engine]] is a modified version of ''GoldenEye 007'''s, and many of the gameplay features are unchanged.<ref name="IGNreview" /> For instance, the manual aiming system, originally inspired by ''[[Virtua Cop]]'',<ref name="hollis-speech">Hollis, Martin (2004). [http://www.zoonami.com/briefing/2004-09-02.php "The Making of GoldenEye 007"]. Retrieved March 29, 2006.</ref> is graphically enhanced but essentially the same. Players can crouch, duck and lean but notably there is still no ability to jump. Despite this, it is possible to drop from most ledges, a feature rarely used in ''GoldenEye''. Most weapons have a finite [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]] and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots. Interaction with the environment is via a single "Use" command, which opens doors, activates computers and so on. Enemies and players can disarm each other at close range, and the player can use this feature to steal weapons or knock foes unconscious. Like ''GoldenEye'', ''Perfect Dark'' uses location-based damage; for example, a shot to the torso causes more damage than a shot to a limb. However, unlike ''GoldenEye'', in the single-player mode a head shot on a guard is instantly fatal on any difficulty level.<ref name="manual" />

The engine includes a number of graphical enhancements, the most conspicuous of which is the option to play in  hi-[[Image resolution|res]] 640 x 480 graphics.<ref name="manual" /> The Nintendo 64 [[Expansion Pak]] is needed to access the solo player levels and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device (around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and Instruction Booklet).<ref name="manual" /> The [[lighting]] system was improved so that gunfire and explosions illuminate areas dynamically, and lights can be shot out to create darkened areas. Further progressions from ''GoldenEye'' include weapon-specific reloading animations, and more elaborate [[Graphic violence|gore]] effects which allow gunshots to project enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects. Another graphical novelty is the "dizziness" effect; if a player is punched, poisoned by a [[throwing knife]] or shot with the Tranquilizer gun, their nausea is represented through a [[motion blur]]red view.

Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref> Both [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] N64 systems run the game in full screen, without the "[[letterbox]]ing" seen in many PAL releases, and there is a [[Aspect ratio (image)|16:9]] option for use on [[widescreen]] televisions.

The disadvantage of such detailed graphics is that the [[frame rate]] inevitably suffers in some areas; this was one of the main criticisms levelled at the game by reviewers (see ''[[#Critical reaction|Critical reaction]]''). The same limitation was present in ''GoldenEye'', but the other graphical enhancements in ''Perfect Dark'' serve to exacerbate the problem. In multiplayer, the game must [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the scene separately for each player, although at reduced resolution. Nevertheless the frame rate issues arise again, particularly if a large number of Simulants are involved.<ref>[http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=n64&game=pdark Gaming Age's] review, paragraph 5. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>

''Perfect Dark'''s engine offered audio features that had not been available on the N64 before; for example, it was one of the few games to offer [[Dolby]] [[Surround Sound]].<ref name="manual" /> Some of the game's audio data was compressed into [[MP3]] format in order to fit into the relatively small storage space afforded by a [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]],<ref>''Perfect Dark'' title screen.</ref> though the music was sequenced. There is full voice-acting for all the dialogue, and the guards can be heard having conversations amongst themselves about the events of the level.<ref>[http://perfectdark.detstar.com/stuff/stuff1.asp detStar] on the guards' private conversations. Retrieved April 7, 2006.</ref>

The artificial intelligence of the guards includes the ability to call for help and sound nearby alarms. The guards can be alerted by nearby gunfire, and the various weapons in the game have distinct volumes; for example, guards are less likely to be alerted by silenced pistols than high-powered rifles. Additionally, they are able to throw grenades and, if the player disarms them, draw a secondary weapon. One criticism raised of ''GoldenEye 007''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s guards was their weakness at very close range, since their weapons appear to shoot straight through the player. This is resolved in ''Perfect Dark'', whose guards can deliver kicks at close range, inflicting damage and causing dizziness. In ''GoldenEye'', the guards could not see through glass <U+2014> a feature included deliberately so that the player could spy on foes through windows.<ref name="hollis-speech" /> This aspect is retained in ''Perfect Dark'', although enemies can now see and shoot over railings. In the later stages of the game, the player encounters Skedar enemies still in reptilian form, and while the Skedar weapons and characteristics are different, their AI is qualitatively the same.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/perfectdark/review.html?sid=2573816 Gamespot] review, paragraph 5. Retrieved June 11, 2006.</ref>

The multiplayer Simulants are considered more advanced, and have the majority of the faculties of a human player. They have the ability to complete multiplayer objectives, such as capturing the briefcase, but they are not able to use some of the weapons, such as remote mines.<ref name="manual" /> Simulants make no attempt to avoid simple traps such as proximity mines or sentry guns, even on the highest skill setting.

There are a number of [[Software bug|bugs]] in the game engine. For example, in the first level, a flaw in the [[collision detection]] makes it possible to pass through a supposedly solid wall, allowing the level to be completed in just six seconds.<ref name="6seconds">[http://qntm.org/defection_a "Defection A For Dummies"], a guide to completing the first level in six seconds.

Upon release, ''Perfect Dark'' received very strong reviews from magazines and websites alike. [[IGN]] opined that the game "features amazing graphics, <U+2026> and the most well-rounded multiplayer mode ever to grace Nintendo 64", saying that their "only gripe with the game is its sometimes sluggish framerate". ''[[GameSpot]]'' concluded "there's finally a game that has eclipsed ''GoldenEye 007''". Gaming Age described it as "probably one of the best FPSs to be released in quite a while", but concedes that "there are some nasty frame rate problems at times". GameCritics.com criticised the "weak characters and an unoriginal storyline", but nevertheless judged  the "extraordinary amount of high-quality multiplayer modes and features" meant that "the game is still a blast". GameRevolution.com again criticised the game's technical shortcomings, noting the "occasional slowdown and <U+2026> a few polygonal glitches", but overall concluded "''Perfect Dark'' shines out as one of the best N64 games". It was also rated the 100th best game made on a Nintendo System in [[Nintendo Power]]'s Top 200 Games list.<ref name="NP Top 200">{{Citation|year=February 2006| title=NP Top 200|periodical=Nintendo Power|volume=200|pages=58-66}}.</ref>

The overall positive reaction from critics can be gauged by the results of review compilation sites; for example, Gamerankings.com makes it the fourth most highly rated game on the Nintendo 64, and claims that the game "improves upon the awesome multi-player mode that made it's [sic] predecessor ''GoldenEye'' a smash hit." [[Metacritic]] describes the game as meeting with "Universal Acclaim" and [[Rotten Tomatoes]] considers the game "Fresh".

Rare was also recognized for its work on the game, as the company was awarded the [[Bafta]] Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000 and the [[Golden Satellite Award]] for Best Interactive Product in 2001.

==Legacy==
Another game also titled ''[[Perfect Dark (Game Boy Color)|Perfect Dark]]'' was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] in September 2000, shortly after the Nintendo 64 game. The storyline of the game was considerably different from the Nintendo 64 incarnation's, as it follows Joanna's attempts to shut down an illegal cyborg manufacturer. While the game uses an overhead rather than first-person view, it has a number of advanced features for a portable game. For example, the game's cutscenes feature sampled speech and a "rumble" facility (akin to the N64's [[Rumble Pak]]) is built into the cartridge.<ref>[http://gameboy.ign.com/objects/013/013801.html IGN] on ''Perfect Dark'' for Game Boy Color. Retrieved April 8, 2006.</ref>

''Perfect Dark'' was the last major first-person shooter game for the Nintendo 64, which was already nearing the end of its lifespan; Nintendo unveiled their new console, the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000. The game was also the last appearance of the ''GoldenEye 007''/''Perfect Dark'' engine. 20 months before ''Perfect Dark'' was released, some of the development team left Rare to form [[Free Radical Design]]. This company went on to develop the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[TimeSplitters]]'', another first-person shooter based around a completely new engine. ''[[TimeSplitters]]'' and its sequels bear many gameplay and presentational similarities to ''GoldenEye'' and ''Perfect Dark'', including a similar manual aiming system, missions with structured objectives, cheat options unlockable through quick level completions, and the earning of multiplayer awards.

''Perfect Dark'' has been featured in many "Best Game of All Time" lists. It placed 15th on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 Games of All Time list in 2006, and 28th in [[Edge (magazine)|Edge magazine]]'s all-time Top 100.<ref>[http://top100.ign.com/2006/011-020.html IGN Readers' Choice 2006 <U+2013> The Top 100 Games Ever].

They gave ''Perfect Dark'' a rating of 9.9 out of a possible 10.0, with its reviewer Joe Fielder saying," As a single-player or multiplayer FPS experience, ''Perfect Dark'' is unparalleled on the console systems."<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/perfectdark/index.html?sid=2573816 ''Perfect Dark'' for N64].

Meanwhile Rare began development of a prequel titled ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]'' for the Nintendo GameCube, but was purchased from Nintendo by Microsoft in 2002.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/Sep02/09-24ProjectRPR.mspx Microsoft press release] on the purchase of Rare. Retrieved April 8, 2006.</ref> Soon after, it was announced that ''Perfect Dark Zero'' would in fact be an [[Xbox]] title. Later it was decided instead to release it for the [[Xbox 360]], and it became a launch title for that system. This game retains ''Perfect Dark''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first-person perspective and mission objective system, although other features were not carried over. Joanna Dark remains the lead character. The game's multiplayer mode allows many more computer players, thanks to the more advanced Xbox 360 hardware, and can also be played online, which was not possible with the Nintendo 64.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/perfectdarkzero/review.html Gamespot's] review of ''Perfect Dark Zero''.
