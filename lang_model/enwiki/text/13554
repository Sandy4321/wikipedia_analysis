{{Campaignbox Theatres of the War of the Grand Alliance}}

The '''War of the Grand Alliance''' ([[1688]]<U+2013>[[1697]]) <U+2013> often called the '''Nine Years<U+2019> War''' or occasionally, the '''War of the League of Augsburg''' or the '''War of the Palatinian Succession''' <U+2013> was a major conflict fought primarily on Continental Europe, but which also encompassed secondary theatres in [[Ireland]] (often called the [[Williamite War]]), and North America (commonly known as [[King William's War]]). 

Since the signing of the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], ending the [[Franco-Dutch War]] ([[1672]]<U+2013>[[1678]]), France<U+2019>s expansionist policies under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had threatened to secure hegemony over Europe. However, by the 1680s the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] was gaining ascendancy in its struggle with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the Balkans <U+2013> strengthening the Emperor<U+2019>s position in central Europe. These advancements encouraged Leopold and his allies <U+2013> the [[Protestant]] [[Germany|German]] princes, Spain, and Sweden <U+2013> to form the defensive [[Grand Alliance|League of Augsburg]] in opposition to France on [[9 July]] [[1686]].

In November 1688 [[William III of England|William of Orange]] successfully invaded [[England]] leading to the [[Glorious Revolution|<U+2018>Glorious Revolution<U+2019>]] and the deposition of [[James II of England|James II]]. With William as [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch republic]] and now as [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|King of England]], he was able to form the coalition to oppose France that he had long since been striving. On [[12 May]] [[1689]], William and Leopold formed the [[Grand Alliance]] with the aim of forcing France back to her borders as designated in the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]].

The war ended indecisively with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick on [[20 September]] [[1697]] by the main powers, France, the Dutch Republic, England and [[Spain]], with Leopold signing later on [[30 October]]. But although the French influence had increased militarily on land <U+2013> and the English at sea <U+2013> the conflict between the [[Habsburgs]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties had yet to be resolved.

==Background==
At the death of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] in 1665, the Spanish throne passed on to his son from his second marriage, the infirm [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. Although Louis did not dispute Charles's accession to the Spanish throne, he did claim that according to local law, at least part of the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]] should devolve to his wife, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], a daughter of the late Philip IV from his first marriage.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War'', p.35</ref> Maria Theresa had renounced these claims when she married Louis, but the renunciation had been conditioned on Spain paying her dowry within eighteen months. The Spanish not only failed to pay in time, but failed to pay at all.<ref>Carsten: ''The Cambridge Modern History V,'' p.210</ref> These inheritance claims led to Louis' first war, the [[War of Devolution]] ([[1667]]<U+2013>[[1668]]).
[[Image:Spanish Habsburg Genealogy.GIF|thumb|400px|Part of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] genealogy.]]
After an easy victory against Spanish forces, Louis decided to sue for peace after the [[Dutch Republic]], [[England]] and [[Sweden]] formed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in opposition. The subsequent peace of [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aix-la-Chapelle]] rewarded Louis with minor gains, most notably of which was [[Lille]], but the pressure from the Triple Alliance was not the only reason Louis accepted such easy terms. Earlier in January 1668, Louis had negotiated a secret partition treaty with the [[Austrian Habsburgs]] to divide up the substantial [[Spanish empire]] should the infirm Charles II die. The Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I (or his children) would inherit the Spanish throne, the American empire, [[Milan]] and ports on the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] coast; whereas Louis would inherit [[Kingdom of Navarre|Spanish Navarre]], the Spanish Netherlands, [[Franche-Comt<U+00E9>]], [[Naples]], [[Sicily]], and the [[Philippines]]. Although there was no formal signing between Louis and Leopold, the Spanish themselves tacitly accepted the partition to prevent any immediate major annexations.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.22</ref> However, Charles II did not die, and his survival through childhood made the succession issue far less immediate.

After French diplomacy brought about the dissolution of the Triple Alliance, Louis prepared for his first great conflict, the [[Franco-Dutch War]] ([[1672]]<U+2013>[[1678]]). Louis<U+2019> war minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]], was keen to take much of the Dutch trade and to break certain Dutch trade monopolies <U+2013> he believed France<U+2019>s economic success could only be assured with the military destruction of the Dutch.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.25</ref> Louis<U+2019> motives though, were more personal. He saw the Dutch intervention in the War of Devolution as a betrayal and was determined to punish and destroy his heretical neighbour.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.35</ref> 
However, despite Leopold having signed a neutrality agreement with Louis, the ease of France<U+2019>s military successes in the Dutch Republic had concerned both the Emperor and the [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]] who, along with Spain (worried over the annexation of the Spanish Netherlands), formed an anti-French coalition on [[30 August]] [[1673]]. On [[28 May]] [[1674]], the [[Diet (assembly)|German Diet]], also concerned about French ambition, declared war on France, summoning the German princes to assist the Emperor. But despite Louis losing his ally, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England <U+2013> who had been starved of funds by his anti-French parliament <U+2013> and being forced to withdraw from most of the territory of the Dutch Republic, France<U+2019>s inherent military and economic strength ensured her successes continued. However by [[1676]], both sides were exhausted enough to be willing to negotiate a settlement.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.33</ref>

==Prelude==
====Treaty of Nijmegen (Nymegen)====
At the end the Franco-Dutch War, Louis had significant advantages over his opponents: his armies had been increasingly successful at the closing stages of hostilities and, unlike his adversaries <U+2013> the Dutch, the German princes and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs <U+2013> Louis had total control of his own policy-making, enabling him to exploit his enemies' differences.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.34</ref> [[William III of England|William of Orange]], the Dutch [[stadtholder]], was determined to keep the allies together, but despite strengthening his hand by marrying [[Mary II of England|Mary]], the daughter of the heir to the English throne [[James II of England|James Stuart, Duke of York]], the financial pressure on the Dutch Republic was considerable.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.34. William became stadtholder and captain general for life in 1672</ref> Consequently the French and Dutch signed a peace treaty on [[10 August]] [[1678]], resulting in the end of Dutch subsidies to their allies. Now with the prospect of the full weight of the French forces falling upon them, the Spanish and Austrians were compelled to follow suit on [[17 September]] [[1678]] and [[5 February]] [[1679]] respectively.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667 <U+2013> 1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.48. The word of the Franco-Dutch peace did not reach the armies in the field, leading to the unnecessary Battle of St Denis on 14 August.</ref> The three treaties are known collectively as the [[peace of Nijmegen]].<ref>Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France <U+2013> Old Regime France,'' p181. Although Nijmegen was a triumph for Louis, peace disappointed him and he had dismissed Pomponne, the minister who had negotiated it.</ref> 
[[Image:Map of Europe after Treaty of Westphalia 1648.gif|thumb|left|320px|Map of the [[European]] boundaries at the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648. The [[Grand Alliance]] aimed to force [[France]] back to her borders as they were at the end of the Thirty Years War, and the end of [[Franco-Spanish War (1653)|Franco-Spanish War]] in 1659. Both treaties are commonly known as the [[Peace of Westphalia]].]]

Although the treaty ensured the survival of the Dutch Republic and its trade, Spain had lost under its terms. Besides losing [[Haiti]] in the [[Caribbean]], Spain also ceded Franche-Comt<U+00E9>, reinforcing Louis<U+2019> control of his territory in [[Alsace]]. Louis also made modest gains in the Spanish Netherlands (largely fort exchanges with Spain), strengthening [[Vauban|Vauban's]] policy of building a defensive barrier of fortresses along France<U+2019>s northern borders. [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], on his eastern border, also remained in French hands, as did [[Freiburg]], but although Louis had settled for moderate terms and relatively small gains, he had been able to break up the allied coalition.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.35</ref> However, convinced that the peace with France was only temporary, William was determined to create a permanent alliance to oppose future French ambition.

====Reunions====
France<U+2019>s military superiority after the Dutch War was never more apparent, but Louis<U+2019> was no longer interested in an adventurist, open-ended war policy as in 1672. The insistence on other powers accepting French supremacy still remained but Louis used threats and dubious legal means, rather than open war, to achieve his objectives. As well as maintaining a huge [[standing army]] after the Dutch war, Vauban<U+2019>s fortress system was extended along France<U+2019>s eastern border with Louis<U+2019> most dangerous foe, Germany. However, to construct a proper defensive system France required more land from her neighbours.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.36</ref>

For this purpose special French courts, called the '[[Chambers of Reunion]]', were set up to seek precedents for French suzerainty over the dependencies of land ceded to France since 1648 and 'reunite' them <U+2013> unsurprisingly, the courts never failed to find these precedents.<ref>Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France <U+2013> Old Regime France,'' p.182</ref> The court<U+2019>s judgments using these quasi-legal means allowed Louis to claim additional territory: more of the Spanish Netherlands, almost all [[Luxembourg|Spanish Luxembourg]], more of Lorraine, parts of the [[Saar River|Saar valley]], the duchy of [[Zweibr<U+00FC>cken]] and the rest of Alsace. On [[30 September]] [[1681]], the Imperial city of [[Strasbourg]] <U+2013> which had not been claimed under the reunions policy <U+2013> was also forced to submit to Louis after [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], Louis<U+2019> war minister, threatened that unless he received compliance <U+2013> <U+201C>All would be burnt and put to the sword." On the same day, Louis<U+2019> troops entered [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] in northern [[Italy]], which he had bought from the [[Duke of Mantua]].<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.37</ref> Casale, together with Louis<U+2019> fort of [[Pinerolo]], allowed France to pin down the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and threaten the Spanish [[Duchy of Milan]]. Louis<U+2019> troops also began the siege of Luxembourg to add to their acquisitions in the [[Moselle River|Moselle]] valley, but although this siege was abandoned in March 1682, French hostility continued.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.48</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | '''Military reforms:''' The French army rapidly expanded during the 17th century. During the War of the Grand Alliance, the numbers in the French army, rose to about 440,000 troops (although its real wartime strength was probably nearer 350,000).<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.28</ref> Previously it had been the practice to drastically reduce numbers between wars (rarely maintaining 10,000 men), but after the Dutch War, a [[standing army]] of about 150,000 men was kept in French service.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.39. States 200,000</ref> The military reforms of [[Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIII]] were accelerated by Louis XIV<U+2019>s war minister [[Michel le Tellier]] and his son and successor, the [[Marquis de Louvois]]. Louis<U+2019> army no longer heavily relied on mercenary and private forces supplied by nobles, but instead consisted of royal regiments, directly responsible and obedient to the king.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.28</ref> The [[battalion]] constituted the French combat unit: one or more battalions (500 <U+2013> 800 troops) formed a [[regiment]], as did two or three cavalry [[squadrons]] (about 140 men per squadron). These forces were primarily volunteers although limited conscription could boost manpower needs.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.29</ref> Other European states began to copy the French model of professional armies, but despite Louis<U+2019> increasing financial problems, he was able to maintain the edge until the end of the century.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.42</ref>

To Louis, these acquisitions under the reunions claims were rational acts of stabilization along his borders (all the lands taken were important strategic entry points between France and her neighbours and all were immediately fortified by Vauban), but the bordering states considered them acts of aggression.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.48</ref> The Spanish and minor German states involved were all cowed by Louis<U+2019> standing army and could only appeal to the Dutch and the Emperor for help. Therefore, on the same day that Strasbourg fell and Casale was occupied, the Dutch signed an alliance with [[Charles XI]] of Sweden, who was angry over his territory of Zweibrucken. This was followed by an alliance with [[Emperor Leopold]] in February 1682 and with Spain in May, but six out of the eight [[Prince-elector|electors]] <U+2013> [[Mainz]], [[Trier]], [[Cologne]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] <U+2013> remained allied to France.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.38.  Louis thought that the support of the German states was so strong that if Leopold died, they may even support a French candidate as emperor.</ref>

Leopold though, was under pressure along his [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] border.<ref>McKay &Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.38</ref> By 1683 the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]], encouraged by the French, had besieged [[Vienna]], defining the high water mark of Ottoman power. Although Vienna was rescued by [[John III Sobieski]], King of Poland, and [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]], Louis was able to take advantage of the Ottoman crisis in the east and renewed the siege of the Spanish city of Luxembourg.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.38</ref> But the Spanish, encouraged by the relief of Vienna and under the misapprehension that the Emperor and the Dutch would assist them, declared war on France in autumn 1683.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.39</ref> Louis reacted with a brief and devastating campaign; by June [[1684]] Spanish resistance had collapsed and Luxembourg had fallen to Vauban and Marshal Cr<U+00E9>qui, leading in August to the negotiations at [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon). In return for a truce with Spain and the Emperor (allowing Leopold and the princes to concentrate on the [[Balkans]]), France was allowed to keep all her reunion claims as well as Strasbourg and Luxembourg for a period of 20 years. Louis hoped to make these acquisitions permanent, but William of Orange remained intent on building a coalition with Spain and the Emperor and retake all that had been won by Louis<U+2019> military intimidation.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.39</ref>

The truce of Regensburg marked a high point of territorial expansion under [[Louis XIV]].<ref>Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France <U+2013> Old Regime France,'' p.183</ref> The French king had reason to be satisfied: Vauban could complete his eastern and northern defences while the Austrian and German princes remained fully occupied in Hungary with the Turks. Further encouragement came in 1685 when the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] came to the English throne. Expecting James to ally himself with France, his son-in-law William of Orange became isolated and powerless, especially because Amsterdam<U+2019>s powerful [[burghers]] wanted no further conflict with France.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.39</ref>

]]

====League of Augsburg====
In October 1685 Louis issued the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], revoking the [[Edict of Nantes]], ending toleration of [[Protestants]] in France.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.143</ref> About 200,000 French Protestants ([[Huguenots]]) were forced to flee the country including many merchants, industrialists, soldiers and sailors. Although the Dutch benefited from the exodus with the increase of 9,000 sailors and 12,600 soldiers, the flight helped destroy the pro-French group in the Dutch Republic, not only because of their Protestant affiliations, but with the exodus of Huguenot merchants (who often acted as Dutch commercial agents), and the harassment of Dutch merchants living in France, it also greatly affected Franco-Dutch trade.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.143</ref>

In England there was growing concern over James<U+2019> [[Catholicism]] but his treatment of the Huguenots within the country reflected the king<U+2019>s principles: on a human level he sympathised with their persecution (realising also that it would be looked upon unfavourably by his mainly Protestant subjects if he did nothing), but on the other hand he distrusted them on political grounds.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.145. As early as July 1685 he had suspected the Huguenots had been mixed up in Monmouth<U+2019>s (Protestant) rebellion.</ref> Elsewhere, in Brandenburg-Prussia the horrified Calvinist Elector, Frederick William, allied himself with the Dutch, as did Brandenburg<U+2019>s [[Baltic region|Baltic]] rival, the Swedes.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.40. The Elector<U+2019>s son Frederick, proved to be William<U+2019>s most loyal ally against the French.</ref> The persecution did not, in itself, lead to a Protestant coalition against France, but in July 1686 the states of southern and western Germany (including Bavaria and the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]), together with the Emperor, Spain and Sweden (in their capacity as princes within the Empire) formed the [[League of Augsburg]] to defend the treaties of [[Peace of Westphalia|Westphalia]], [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Nijmegen]] and Regensburg.<ref> McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.41</ref>

Initially the League posed little threat to Louis, but during 1686/87 Leopold made substantial progress against the Turks at [[Buda]] and [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs (1687)|Moh<U+00E1>cs]]. The subsequent revolt within the Turkish army and deposition of Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] paralysed the Ottomans, enabling Leopold<U+2019>s forces to move on [[Belgrade]] the following year.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.41</ref> These remarkable victories had a profound effect on Europe. In contrast to Louis who had refused to help, both Protestant and Catholic princes extolled Leopold as a champion of Christendom; almost overnight the French king<U+2019>s support in Germany disintegrated and Louis was branded as the <U+2018>Christian Turk<U+2019>.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.41</ref>

====Archbishop of Cologne====
By summer of 1688 it was clear to Louis and his principal advisors [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]] and [[Charles Colbert, marquis de Croissy|Colbert de Croissey]], that they had to act before the Emperor turned his attention from the Balkans to lead the Dutch, and a comparatively united German Empire, against France on the [[Rhine]].<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.42</ref> It was therefore imperative that the Turks were encouraged to continue fighting and tie down Leopold while Vauban finished his defences on their eastern border. 

The French king was concerned enough to take steps to perpetuate his influence at [[Cologne]].<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.189</ref> The pro-French [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] held a number of strategically important bishoprics (they provided links for the Dutch with the Empire and the Spanish Netherlands), straddling the southern and eastern frontiers of the Dutch Republic. The existing Archbishop, [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria|Maximilian]], was old and frail and Louis wanted to be sure of his successor. He therefore had his client, [[William Egon of F<U+00FC>rstenberg]] elected as [[coadjutor]], and by implication, the next Archbishop.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.189</ref> After the incumbent Archbishop died in June 1688, and despite all the signs signifying victory for F<U+00FC>rstenberg, an inconclusive election for the position followed, after the brother of the [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]], [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria|Joseph Clement]] (supported by the Emperor and subsequently by [[Pope Innocent XI]]) stood against F<U+00FC>rstenberg. However, the disputed election at Cologne had aroused further fears in Germany of French aggression and helped further to unite the German princes. Moreover, the Dutch oligarchs and merchants, also more fearful of Louis<U+2019> ambitions, gave William their wholehearted support. From June 1688 the disputed election looked like it would provide the spark to ignite the war between Louis and the German princes.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.191</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | '''Siege warfare:''' [[Siege]] warfare was prevalent in 17th century. Amongst the chief practitioners of siege warfare and fortress design was Louis<U+2019> celebrated engineer [[Vauban|S<U+00E9>bastien le Prestre de Vauban]]. Although Vauban did not originate the low-lying style of fortifications common to the period, he certainly greatly improved on the design.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.32</ref> Vauban considered a minimum of 20,000 men were essential to besiege a town successfully, but it was also important to defend one<U+2019>s own territory from investment by the enemy; in 1688 the French committed almost half their army, 166,000 men, garrisoning 221 strongholds.<ref>Parker: ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare,'' p.114</ref> The Dutch engineer, [[Menno Van Coehoorn]], was, like Vauban, employed in both fortification and siege warfare. In 1692 he defended the city of [[Namur (city)|Namur]] against his great rival. Although Vauban eventually took the city, Coehoorn<U+2019>s role was reversed three years later as he successfully conducted the attack on Namur in 1695.

Louis<U+2019> obsession of making France invulnerable led to the longest war to date of his reign <U+2013> the War of the Grand Alliance.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.48</ref> Louis only planned a short campaign (similar to that against the Spanish in 1683/84), with the aim of encouraging the Turks to continue their war, and to frighten the Emperor and the Germans into accepting the Reunions claims (as confirmed at the peace of Regensberg), as permanent. By attacking across the Rhine to invest [[Philippsburg]] on [[27 September]] [[1688]] (the only one of the three major fortresses in Alsace which Louis did not already control), Louis also hoped to resolve the Cologne election in favour of F<U+00FC>rstenberg and secure part of the Palatinate in favour of his sister-in-law. 

Philippsburg fell on [[30 October]] to the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)|Dauphin]] (aided by [[Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras|Marshal Duras]] and Vauban). [[Mannheim]] capitulated after a short siege on [[11 November]], followed by [[Frankenthal]], [[Oppenheim]], [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Mainz]]. Although militarily successful, as well as strengthening the Turkish resolve in the Balkans, the gambit to bring the Germans to terms failed.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.81</ref> Just after the initial attack in October 1688, [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Hanover]] and [[Hesse-Cassel]] had all agreed to fight Louis, and Maximillian Emmanuel of Bavaria was ready to lead an army formed by the Emperor and the German princes of the Rhine.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.44</ref>  With this escalation, Louis, unprepared for a wider war, lay waste the lands of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]], [[Baden]] and [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] (lands immediately to the north and east of Alsace), to make it incapable of sustaining the enemy. Louvois drafted a list of towns for destruction: Heidelberg was torched on [[2 March]] [[1689]] and Mannheim on [[8 March]]; Speyer, [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Oppenheim and [[Bingen]], as well as many surrounding villages, also suffered under Louis<U+2019> destructive policy. Once the French had created their Rhineland defensive barrier they fended off the Germans as best they could, but Marshal Duras lacked the troops to defeat the enemy. These early French victories were partly reversed when Mainz fell on [[8 September]] [[1689]] to a German force commanded by Duke Charles of Lorraine while Kaiserw<U+00F6>rth and [[Bonn]] fell to the Elector of Brandenberg.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.50</ref> But while Louis XIV was busy on the Rhine, William<U+2019>s attention was turned towards England.

===='Glorious Revolution' (1688<U+2013>89)====
[[Image:Detail of the House of Stuart Genealogy.GIF|thumb|430px|Part of he [[House of Stuart]] genealogy. (The emblem shown is William and Mary's coat of arms). [[William III of England|William III]] became James<U+2019> son-in-law when he married his daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in 1677. Mary became joint sovereign with her husband in 1689 after the '[[Glorious Revolution]]'.]]

{{main|Glorious Revolution}}
The openly Catholic James II<U+2019>s ill-advised attempts to Catholicise the army, government and other institutions had proved increasingly unpopular with his (mainly Protestant) subjects. By [[royal prerogative]] James suspended the operation of various statutes such as the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] and the [[Test Act]]; he also suspended penal legislation against religious nonconformity, permitting [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] to worship in meeting-houses, and Catholics to worship in private.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.156</ref>

James<U+2019> open Catholicism and his dealings with Catholic France had also strained relations between England and the Dutch Republic, but because his wife Mary was the Protestant heir to the English throne, William had been reluctant to act against James in case it ruined her succession prospects.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.44</ref> However, on [[10 June]] [[1688]] James<U+2019>s second wife, [[Mary of Modena]], gave birth to a male heir, threatening a Catholic dynasty to which neither the English public nor William would countenance.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.50</ref> Prominent English statesmen <U+2013> [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], [[Tories]] and Protestant churchmen <U+2013> secretly invited William to invade England and assume the throne. The Dutch oligarchs, worried about Anglo-French alliance, gave the Stadtholder a free hand to use Dutch troops; William also had the tacit approval of the Emperor and even the anti-French Pope Innocent XI in return for assurances that Catholics would be tolerated in Britain.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.44</ref>

Louis did little to stop William<U+2019>s invasion of England (his principal concern was with the German powers in the Rhineland, dispelling fears in the Dutch Republic of a possible French attack upon them). This enabled William to land his forces unhindered at [[Torbay]] on [[15 November]] ([[5 November]] O.S) 1688. French diplomats had calculated that William's invasion would plunge England into a protracted civil war which would absorb Dutch resources or draw England closer to France;<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p.30</ref> however, there was no civil war and William was welcomed by the people. The revolution that shortly followed, commonly know as the <U+2018>[[Glorious Revolution]]<U+2019>, ended James<U+2019> reign; William and Mary became joint sovereigns on [[13 February]] [[1689]] while James became a refugee in France.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.209</ref> 
[[Image:The Arrival of William III.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''The Arrival of William III'' by Sir James Thornhill. [[William III of England|William III]] landed in [[England]] on [[5 November]] ([[Guy Fawkes night|Guy Fawkes]] day); a day already special in the Protestant calendar.]] 
William had come to England to use her power in the struggle against French expansion. But although English troops were used extensively on the continent (almost as many as the Dutch), English politicians and generals played little part in the War; only at sea was command given to English rather than Dutch admirals.<ref>McKay & Scott p.47: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815''</ref>

William<U+2019>s success rapidly led to the formation of the European coalition he had long desired. On [[12 May]] [[1689]] the Dutch and Emperor Leopold signed the Grand Alliance (the aim of which was to force the French back to their borders of 1648 and 1659); this meant for the Emperor and the German princes the re-conquest of Lorraine, Strasbourg, parts of Alsace and some fortresses on the Rhine.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.47</ref> The Emperor also insisted that the other allies should promise to support his claims to the Spanish succession if the present incumbent, the childless Charles II, died during the war.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.47</ref> William, as King William III of England, signed in December. Spain and [[Savoy]] joined the coalition in June 1690; Sweden and the major German Princes also associated themselves with the coalition. France was to fight alone, save for the loose relationship with the Turks who were still fighting against Leopold in the Balkans <U+2013> a war that would last until 1699.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.45</ref>

The German princes proved willing to co-operate in the war against Louis and accepting of Leopold as their leader (although they had no intention of sacrificing their own independence). Since the Swedes were part of the coalition, Frederick of Brandenburg<U+2013>Prussia put aside his differences with them over [[Pomerania]], and the Emperor himself acted for the Empire rather than just his own dynastic and hereditary lands in Austria.

The effective range of both the matchlock and flintlock was between 45 <U+2013> 90 m (50 <U+2013> 100 yards) against large formations, resulting in close-quarter actions and high casualty rates.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.31</ref> The plug bayonet (inserted into the muzzle of the musket), was itself further developed and replaced by the socket bayonet in the 1680s, enabling the musket to be fired while the bayonet was still attached: the [[musketeer]] had become his own pikeman.<ref>Dupuy: ''The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History 4th ed.'' p.572.

The war in [[Ireland]] was an extension of the continental struggle. After leaving France, the exiled James II, together with Count d<U+2019>Avaux, the French ambassador to James<U+2019> court (and various other supporters), landed in Ireland at [[Kinsale]] in March 1689. Along with the Catholic Lord Deputy of Ireland, Richard Talbot, the [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel|Duke of Tyrconnell]], James hoped first to establish control in Ireland before proceeding on to [[Scotland]], and thence England, in an attempt to regain his throne.<ref>McNally: ''Battle of the Boyne 1690,'' p.13</ref>

Several obstacles lay in James' way. Most influential Irish supporters were reluctant to <U+2018>liberate<U+2019> England and Scotland from William <U+2013> a number wished to break the English connection altogether; secondly, Louis held all the purse-strings and was reluctant to supply troops to Ireland; and thirdly, total success depended on pacifying the parts of [[Ulster]] <U+2013> including Protestant strongholds of [[Londonderry]] and [[Enniskillen]] <U+2013> that remained hostile to the old Catholic king.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p.34</ref> 

The subjugation of Ulster however proved a forlorn hope. The 105 days siege of Londonderry was abandoned on [[10 August]] ([[31 July]] O.S) and, on the same day, James<U+2019> forces under Viscount Mountcashel were routed at [[Battle of Newtownbutler|Newtownbutler]]. Further bad news arrived for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause from Britain. Although William<U+2019>s army in Scotland under the command of General [[Hugh Mackay]] was defeated by [[John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee|Dundee]] at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] on [[6 August]] ([[27 July]] O.S) 1689, the Jacobite [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] were themselves defeated at [[Dunkeld]] on [[31 August]] ([[21 August]] O.S) leading to the dispersion of the clans and the end, for now at least, of the Jacobite struggle in Scotland.<ref>Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' p.17</ref>

On [[23 August]] ([[13 August]] O.S), 15,000 Dutch, English and Danish troops of William<U+2019>s army, commanded by [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Marshal Schomberg]], landed near [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]]. However, after taking [[Carrickfergus]] and [[Belfast]] Schomberg<U+2019>s army stalled at [[Dundalk]], suffering through the winter months from sickness and desertion.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.228</ref>  James and d<U+2019>Avaux were confident that with a little French help they could drive Schomberg out of Ireland the following year, but the signs were ominous; James<U+2019> army lacked provisions and supplies and worryingly, William, realising reinforcements would be needed for a successful outcome announced in January he would come to Ireland in person with a substantial army.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' p.228</ref> Louis and his war minister Louvois were reluctant to supply men that were badly needed on the continent;<ref>Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' p.14</ref> although 6,000 troops from the Savoy front, commanded by Count [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Lauzun]], were eventually sent to Kinsale in March [[1690]].<ref>Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' p.23. Six thousand Irish troops were sent to Europe in exchange.</ref> On [[24 June]] ([[14 June]] O.S), William landed at Carrickfergus with 15,000 troops, bringing the total of the Williamite forces to almost 44,000; (James could muster 39,000 in all).<ref>Kilpatrick: ''William of Orange: A dedicated Life 1650-1702,'' p.57. The strength of the Williamite army varies from 35,000 to 44,000, depending on the source.</ref> No French fleet attempted to stop them <U+2013> it was in France<U+2019>s interest that William directed his attention and resources to Ireland.
[[Image:Map of Ireland - Williamite War.GIF|thumb|250px|left|Map of Ireland. To [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] the [[Ireland|Irish]] campaign was more of an attempt to occupy [[William III of England|William III]] than it was to maintain [[James II of England|James II]] and assist him in regaining his throne.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.50</ref>]]
Meanwhile the epicentre of the war on the Continent had moved from the Rhine to the Spanish Netherlands and the French<U+2013>Flanders border where, on [[1 July]] ([[21 June]] O.S) 1690, the theatre<U+2019>s French commander [[Marshal Luxembourg]] defeated [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck|Prince Waldeck]] at [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Fleurus]]. Later on [[10 July]] ([[30 June]] O.S) Louis<U+2019> navy, under [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville|Tourville]], defeated the Anglo-Dutch fleet under [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Torrington]] at [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Beachy Head]], giving France control of the [[English Channel]]. These French successes threatened not only the prospect of limitless reinforcements to Ireland but also a possible invasion of England.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p.35</ref> But despite William<U+2019>s victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on [[11 July]] ([[1 July]] O.S) <U+2013> leading to James<U+2019> hastened flight back to France <U+2013> Louis still had a clear strategic advantage. However, James<U+2019> appeals for assistance to Louis were not heeded; with his attention drawn towards the Continent, the French king would neither send more troops to Ireland nor, for the moment, invade England.<ref>Kilpatrick: ''William of Orange: A dedicated Life 1650-1702,'' p.64</ref>

[[Dublin]] and [[Waterford]] were occupied by the Williamite forces, but after an unsuccessful [[Siege of Limerick (1690)|siege of Limerick]] William returned to [[London]] in September 1690 leaving [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone]] in charge.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p.37</ref> [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Lauzun]] and his French troops also returned home, but although Tryconnel was successful in obtaining arms and a new general he failed to get new French troops <U+2013> the Boyne had caused Louis to think again, sapping his enthusiasm for supporting James.<ref>Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' p.74</ref> Louis was also running out of Irish ports; the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] took [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Kinsale]] in southern Ireland in October (isolating the Jacobite forces from further supplies), ready for the ''[[coup de gr<U+00E2>ce]]'' the following year. 

Together with the successful Williamite siege of [[Siege of Athlone|Athlone]] in June <U+2013> July, and Ginkell<U+2019>s victory over the Jacobite forces at [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]] on [[22 July]] ([[12 July]] O.S) [[1691]], James<U+2019> aspirations in Ireland were all but over.<ref>Dupuy: ''The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History 4th ed.'' p.613</ref> [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|Limerick]] was besieged for a second time on [[4 September]] leading to the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. The treaty,  signed by Ginkell and the Irish commander, [[Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan|Patrick Sarsfield]] on [[13 October]] ([[3 October]] O.S) 1691, finally ended Louis<U+2019> Irish diversion and James<U+2019> hopes, for now at least, of regaining his kingdom.

The pacification of Ireland had released thousands of troops for William<U+2019>s war on the continent but Louis also benefited from 12,000 Irish troops (the so-called [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]) ceded to him under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick. William had returned to the Spanish Netherlands in early 1691, but despite the death of Louis<U+2019> talented War Minister, Louvois, the campaign in the Spanish Netherlands was a military failure for the Allies.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander,'' p.43</ref> [[Louis Fran<U+00E7>ois, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]] took [[Mons]] on [[10 April]] followed by Marshal Luxembourg<U+2019>s victory against Prince Waldeck at [[Battle of Leuze|Leuze]] on [[19 September]]. This success was followed in 1692 at [[Namur (city)|Namur]] (which capitulated on [[25 May|25]] <U+2013> [[26 May]]) <U+2013> by the middle of the year the French were ready for an invasion of England. 

At [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] the court of the exiled King James had for two years insisted with the French War Office that England was ready for a restoration.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution,'' p.13</ref> For this purpose, an army 20,000 troops assembled around [[Cherbourg]], while the French fleet concentrated in the [[Normandy|Norman]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] ports. Reminiscent of 1588 and the threat from the [[Spanish Armada]] all England was alerted and its defences prepared to resist the invasion. But the coming battle for the control of the channel would be a very uneven struggle; [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville|Tourville<U+2019>s]] fleet of 44 vessels were soon scattered by Admirals [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Russell<U+2019>s]] and [[George Rooke|Rooke<U+2019>s]] fleet of 99 rated ships, eventually cornering, and destroying 12 French vessels in anchorage at [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|La Hogue]].<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV,'' p.230</ref> The battle  not only ended serious French invasion plans but now, starved of funds, it also spelt the end of France<U+2019>s [[Atlantic]] navy.<ref>Mackay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.48</ref> 

Other fronts were less active; operations along the [[Moselle]] and [[Rhine]] had declined since the initial clashes of 1688/89. The German forces outnumbered [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges|Marshal de Lorge<U+2019>s]] French forces (who throughout [[1692]] had continued their modest campaign of ravaging and raiding in the area), but although by 1693 Marshal de Lorge<U+2019>s army totaled 45,000 men (enabling them to capture [[Heidelberg]] on [[21 May|21]] <U+2013> [[22 May]]), no decisive campaign in the east was forthcoming.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.57</ref> Meanwhile, in the Spanish Netherlands, despite Louis falling ill and having to retire to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] (never again to take to the battlefield with his army), Marshal Luxembourg defeated William<U+2019>s army at the bloody [[Battle of Landen]]. The battle though, had little effect beyond attrition; despite suffering enormous casualties, William was able to maintain himself in the field.<ref>Churchill: ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples: Age of Revolution,'' p.16. Churchill states the battle was unmatched in its slaughter except for Malplaquet or Borodino for over 200 years.</ref>

Famine had exhausted the protagonists in 1694 and the year saw no great battles or sieges. Although William was able to take the small fortress of [[Huy]] in September, neither side wanted a repetition of the bloodbath at Landen.<ref>Kilpatrick: ''William of Orange: A dedicated Life 1650-1702,'' p.73</ref> At sea, the Anglo-Dutch fleets were sent to help the Allied war effort in Italy and Spain. With the French fleet largely confined to port the rapidly increasing [[Royal Navy]] had gained the upper hand, forcing a strategic re-think in France <U+2013> the French navy switched from fleet warfare to privateering against Anglo-Dutch shipping. This caused serious damage to the commerce of the maritime powers, and together with the Anglo-Dutch fleets enforcing the blockade, the Allies were unable to use their navies in an offensive way against either Europe or French possessions overseas; Louis could only be defeated on the Continent.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.48</ref> 

In January 1695, Louis<U+2019> undefeated commander Marshal Luxembourg died; with his passing, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]] became French commander in the Spanish Netherlands. Because Villeroi<U+2019>s talents fell short of Luxembourg<U+2019>s, the defensive nature of the war was further emphasised. However, the Allies achieved the last great victory of the War of the Grand Alliance in the Spanish Netherlands <U+2013> the retaking of Namur. Coehoorn, in a role reversal of 1692, led the attack on the town which finally capitulated on [[5 September]].

Elsewhere, in northern [[Italy]], the French forces commanded by [[Nicolas Catinat|Marshal Catinat]] had earlier defeated [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy]] at the [[Battle of Staffarda]] on [[18 August]] 1690. The following year Catinat took [[Nice]] between [[24 March]] and [[2 April]] and, while campaigning along the [[Po]], he also captured [[Carmagnola]] just south of [[Turin]]. However, after Savoy was reinforced with imperial forces, raising their number to 45,000, Catinat was forced to pull back, losing Carmagnola in October. Despite a large numerical disadvantage throughout [[1692]] the French commander was able to hold on to [[Susa, Italy|Susa]] and [[Pinerolo]] and, in the following year (after French reinforcements were sent to aid Catinat), he defeated Amadeus at the [[Battle of Marsaglia]] on [[4 October]].<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.60</ref> Throughout 1694 the theatre was relatively quiet, but although Amadeus had been badly bruised by the French, by 1695 both he and Louis were keen to cut a deal.

In 1696, Victor Amadeus and Louis concluded peace by signing the Treaty of Turin on [[29 August]]. The Duke of Savoy was the first major partner to abandon the Allied coalition but Louis had agreed to substantial concessions; he surrendered Nice and the fortress of Pinerolo to Savoy and abandoned the fortress of [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]]. However, the peace undermined the Spanish and Austrian troops who had been sent to aid Victor Amadeus, and furthermore, opened [[Duchy of Milan|Spanish Milan]] to possible French invasion. The two powers therefore made an armistice with France in northern Italy, which, to William<U+2019>s consternation, allowed Louis to transfer 30,000 men to the hard-pressed fronts in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.51</ref>

[[Image:Savoy and Catalonia.png|thumb|340px| Unlike the fighting elsewhere, [[Savoy]] witnessed battles of manoeuvre. The French commander, [[Nicolas Catinat|Catinat]], was unusual amongst other commanders in that he did not hail from the upper reaches of the aristocracy.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.60</ref>]]

Throughout 1696 and 1697 the main theatre of the war saw little action. Villeroi in Flanders and Boufflers on the Meuse commanded a total of 125,000 men against which William III, the [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince of Baden]] and the Landgrave of Hesse could muster a similar number. At the start of the campaign season in 1697 the French took [[Ath]] on [[5 June]] and the Prince of Baden was able to take Ebernberg in September just before the end of the war. Behind the scenes however, William<U+2019>s and Louis<U+2019> representatives were bargaining hard for peace.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.60</ref> The Dutch Republic, England and France alike, were facing economic and financial exhaustion.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.51</ref>

The only decisive theatre on the continent was in [[Spain]]. The Spanish could offer nothing more than token resistance and the Allies were unable to provide enough support.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.49</ref> However, the war in Spain was a sideshow for Louis. The theatre was dominated by amphibious warfare where naval assistance was necessary to seize coastal towns, of which [[Barcelona]] was the greatest prize.<ref>Lynn: ''The French wars 1667<U+2013>1714: The Sun King at War,'' p.57</ref> The French forces, commanded by [[Anne-Jules, 2nd duc de Noailles|Duke de Noailles]], numbered 12,000 in 1690 dropping to 10,000 in 1691; only in 1694 when other fronts were relatively quiet did the Spanish front grow in importance, (but even then Louis invested only 26,000 troops). After [[Roses|Rosas]] fell in 1693, the French drove deeper into [[Catalonia]], defeating the Spanish at the [[Battle of Torroella]] (Ter) on [[27 May]] 1694 and taking [[Palamos]] on [[10 June]]; [[Girona|Gerona]] fell on [[29 June]]. The arrival in August of an Allied fleet under [[Lord Admiral Edward Russell|Admiral Russell]] forestalled an intended French siege of Barcelona in 1694/95. However, after the Allied fleet departed from [[Cadiz]] and sailed north in 1696, [[Louis Joseph, duc de Vend<U+00F4>me|Vend<U+00F4>me]], with the assistance of French fleet under [[Victor-Marie d'Estr<U+00E9>es]], took Barcelona in 1697, the final major action of the war.

====North America (1689<U+2013>97)====
{{main|King William's War}}
The European war was reflected in North America <U+2013> albeit very different in meaning and scale. Notwithstanding a formal agreement between France and England to preserve peace, French policy in North America and the [[West Indies]] (the crown jewels of the English empire) had been aggressive towards the English colonies.<ref>Guttridge: ''The Colonial Policy of William III in America and the West Indies,'' p.45</ref>  Actions by Louis include the invasion of English West Indies, in particular the divided island (half French, half English) of [[St Kitts]]; in the west down the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]; in the north-east from [[Acadia]] into [[Maine]], and in the north among the Indian tribes between [[Canada]], [[New York]] and [[New England]].<ref>Guttridge: ''The Colonial Policy of William III in America and the West Indies,'' p.45</ref> Moreover [[Hudson Bay]] was a focal point of dispute between the Protestant English and Catholic French colonists, both of whom claiming a share of its occupation and trade. It was with this background that in April 1689 William informed his colonists of his intention to declare war on France. 

[[Image:Quebec 1690.jpg|thumb|left|300px|19th century print showing [[Quebec]] batteries firing on [[William Phips|Phip<U+2019>s]] ships during October 1690.]]

Although important to the colonists of England and France, the North American theatre of the War of the Grand Alliance, commonly called [[King William's War]], was somewhat of a sideshow to European statesmen. Despite numerical superiority the English colonists suffered repeated defeats as [[New France]] effectively organised its French troops, Canadian militia and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies to attack frontier settlements.<ref>Taylor: ''American Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p.290</ref>

The conflict began in 1689 with a series of Indian massacres (the first of which was the destruction of [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]], [[New Hampshire]]) instigated by the governor of Canada, [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]]. This was followed in August by [[Bristol, Maine|Pemaquid]], [[Maine]], and in February 1690, the town of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] on the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]]; massacres at [[Casco, Maine|Casco]], and Salmon Falls shortly followed.<ref>Elson: ''History of the United States of America,'' p.163</ref> In response, on [[1 May]] 1690 at the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] Conference, colonial representatives elected to invade Canada. In August a land force commanded by Colonel Winthrop set off for [[Montreal]], and a naval force, commanded by [[William Phips|Sir William Phips]] (who earlier on [[11 May]] had seized the capital of French [[Acadia]], [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]]), set sail for [[Quebec]] via the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. Both the expeditions against Quebec and St Lawrence were humiliating and financial disasters, and, to compound the failures, the French were able to retake Port Royal. Phips sailed for England to request support, but William, whose navy was busy in the English Channel and whose troops were required in Ireland and the Spanish Netherlands, could provide little help for his distant colony; the colonists were left largely to defend themselves.<ref>Taylor: '' American Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p.290</ref> 

The Quebec expedition was the last major offensive of King William<U+2019>s War; for the remainder of the war the English colonists were reduced to defensive operations and skirmishes. However, the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Five Nations]] suffered from the ineptitude of their English allies.<ref>Taylor: ''American Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p.290</ref> In 1693 and 1696, the French and their Indian allies ravaged Iroquois towns and destroyed crops while New York colonists remained passive. After the English and French made peace with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, the Iroquois, now abandoned by the English colonists, remained at war with New France until 1701.<ref>Taylor: '' American Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p.291</ref>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Western Europe 1700.jpg|thumb|340px|Map of European borders as they stood after the Treaty of Ryswick and just previous to [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV's]] last great war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701.]]

There was considerable pressure from politicians in both [[England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] for peace. Commerce in both countries was suffering, and the continual disruption of trade was now undermining their resolve to continue the war <U+2013> the financial and economic exhaustion felt by the maritime powers was also being felt by [[France]].<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.51</ref> By the end of the 1696 campaigning season, both [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] were determined on peace. Louis<U+2019> aggressive stance had become increasingly moderate, but above all, he felt it essential to break up the Allied coalition before the infirm [[Charles II of Spain]] died <U+2013> France would have far less chance of gaining the Spanish succession if it was still at war with [[Spain]] and if [[Austria|Austria<U+2019>s]] allies were still committed to support [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold<U+2019>s]] claims.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.51</ref>

A peace congress opened in May 1697 at William's palace in Ryswick near [[The Hague]]. The Swedes were the official mediators but in fact it was Williams' advisor [[William Bentinck, Earl of Portland]], and Louis' general, [[Louis Fran<U+00E7>ois, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]], who found it easier to come to a settlement in private. William himself had no intention of continuing the war or for pressing Leopold<U+2019>s claims in the Rhineland or Spanish succession <U+2013> to him it was more important for the security of England and the Dutch Republic to obtain Louis<U+2019> recognition of the 1688 revolution.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.52</ref> Therefore, on [[20 September]] [[1697]], France, the Dutch Republic, England and Spain signed the Treaty of Ryswick. Emperor Leopold though, desperate for a continuation of the war so as to strengthen his own claims to the Spanish succession, was reluctant to seek peace with Louis. However, because he was still at war with the [[Ottoman Turk|Turks]], and could not face fighting France alone, Leopold also sought terms and signed the treaty on [[30 October]].<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.52</ref>

By the peace terms the French retained the whole of [[Alsace]] and [[Strasbourg]], but Louis returned [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] to Spain and other areas seized under the reunions claims in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. As well as returning territory captured during the war along the [[Rhine]], [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] was also handed back to its duke, though France retained enough of it to ensure effective military control. Louis also evacuated [[Catalonia]] (to curry favour with [[Madrid]] regarding the question of the Spanish succession) and gave way regarding the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] and [[Cologne]] issues.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.52</ref> In North America, territorial gains made by the protagonists in the English and French colonies were returned to the original holders, establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. However in the Caribbean, Spain formally ceded [[Saint-Domingue]] to France.<ref>Parker: ''Times Atlas of World History,'' p.156</ref> 

Neither Leopold nor the German princes had achieved their aim of pushing France back to the [[Peace of Westphalia|Westphalian]] borders, but Louis<U+2019> more extensive ambitions in the Rhineland had been curtailed. Austria would also gain influence after their peace with the Turks in 1699 <U+2013> under the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] the Emperor gained all of Hungary and Transylvania.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.76</ref> Although Louis continued to shelter [[James II of England|James II]], he now recognised William as King of Protestant England <U+2013> [[Jacobitism]] had been suppressed and [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] were now firmly under direct control. French naval power had also been destroyed, paving the way for English naval supremacy in the following century <U+2013> Britain had emerged as a European power in her own right.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers 1648<U+2013>1815,'' p.53</ref>

Both the French and the [[Grand Alliance]] considered the agreements regarding France<U+2019>s borders, as stipulated in the treaty, as little more than interim ones <U+2013> the disputes over who would succeed the infirm Charles II had yet to be resolved. Within four years, both James II and William III would be dead, and Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance would plunge into an even more ferocious struggle <U+2013> the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].
