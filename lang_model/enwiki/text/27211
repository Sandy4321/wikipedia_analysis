The '''1983 UK general election''' was held on 9 June 1983. It gave the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Margaret Thatcher]] the most decisive election victory since [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|that of Labour in 1945]]. 

The opposition vote split almost evenly between the SDP/Liberal Alliance and Labour. With its worst performance since 1918, the Labour vote fell by over 3 million from 1979 and this accounted for both a national swing of almost 4% towards the Conservatives and their larger parliamentary majority of 144, even though the Conservatives' total vote did fall slightly. 

Mrs Thatcher's first four years as prime minister of the United Kingdom had not been an easy time. Unemployment had rocketed in the first three years of her time in office as she battled to control inflation that had ravaged Britain for most of the [[1970s]]. By the start of 1982, unemployment had passed the 3,000,000 mark - for the first time since before the [[Second World War]] - and the economy had been in recession for nearly two years. However, British victory in the [[Falklands War]] later that year sparked a dramatic rise in Tory popularity, and as Mrs Thatcher's new found popularity continued in 1983 the Tories were most people's firm favourites to win the election. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm]

The SDP-Liberal Alliance polled only 675,985 votes behind the Labour Party but received 186 fewer seats. The Liberals argued that a proportional electoral system would have given them a more representative number of MPs. Changing the electoral system had been a long-running Liberal Party campaign plank and would later be adopted by the [[Liberal Democrats]].

[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Michael Foot]] resigned soon after the election and was succeeded by [[Neil Kinnock]]. Although the election was one of the party's worst, the new crop of MPs included two future prime ministers, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].

The Conservatives won with a majority of 144 seats

==Background to Election 1983==
[[Michael Foot]] was elected leader of the [[British Labour Party|Labour party]] in 1980, replacing [[James Callaghan]]. The election of Foot signalled that the core of the party was swinging to the left and the move exacerbated divisions within the party. In 1981 a group of senior figures including [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left Labour to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). The SDP agreed to a pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] for the 1983 elections and stood as [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|The Alliance]].

The campaign displayed the huge divisions between the two major parties. Thatcher had been extremely unpopular during her first two years in office until the swift and decisive victory in the Falklands War, coupled with an improving economy, considerably raised her standings in the polls. The Conservatives' key issues included employment, economic growth, and defence. Labour's campaign manifesto involved leaving the [[European Economic Community]], abolishing the [[House of Lords]], abandoning the [[United Kingdom]]'s nuclear deterrent by cancelling [[Trident]] and removing cruise missiles <U+2014> a policy programme dubbed by Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] as [[The longest suicide note in history|"the longest suicide note in history"]]. "Although, at barely 37 pages, it only seemed interminable", noted [[Roy Hattersley]]. Pro-Labour political journalist [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', commented, "There was something magnificently brave about Michael Foot's campaign <U+2014> but it was like the [[Battle of the Somme]]."<ref>http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election/story/0,15803,1456497,00.html</ref>
