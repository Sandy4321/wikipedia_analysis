Cooper did well academically in most of his courses,<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 41.</ref> but was not accepted in the college's drama club.<ref name="immortal"/> His drawings and watercolors, however, were exhibited throughout the dormitory, and he was named art editor for the college yearbook.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 46.</ref> During the summers of 1922 and 1923, Cooper worked at [[Yellowstone National Park]] as a tour guide driving the yellow open-top buses.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 24.</ref><ref>Swindell 1980, p. 43.</ref> Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell, he left college suddenly in February 1924, spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist, and then returned to Helena,<ref>Swindell 1980, pp. 47<U+2013>48.</ref> where he sold editorial cartoons to the ''Independent'', a local newspaper.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 49.</ref>

Lasky]] at [[Paramount Pictures]] for $175 per week.<ref name="meyers-32"/> In 1927, with help from established movie star [[Clara Bow]], Cooper landed high-profile roles in ''[[Children of Divorce (1927 film)|Children of Divorce]]'' and ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'', the first film to win an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref name="oscars-1929"/> That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in ''[[Arizona Bound (1927 film)|Arizona Bound]]'' with Betty Jewel, and ''[[Nevada (1927 film)|Nevada]]'' with [[Thelma Todd]] and [[William Powell]]<U+2014>both films directed by [[John Waters (director born 1893)|John Waters]].<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 35, 39.</ref>

In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful [[Fay Wray]] in ''[[The Legion of the Condemned]]'' and ''[[The First Kiss (film)|The First Kiss]]''<U+2014>advertising them as the studio's "glorious young lovers".<ref name="arce-51">Arce 1979, p. 51.</ref> Their on-screen chemistry, however, failed to generate much excitement with audiences.<ref name="arce-51"/><ref>Meyers 1998, p. 44.</ref><ref name="dickens-7">Dickens 1970, p. 7.</ref> Still, with each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers.<ref name="dickens-7"/> During this time, he was earning as much as $2,750 per film<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 47.</ref> and receiving a thousand fan letters per week.<ref>Swindell 1980, p. 93.</ref> Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies in films such as ''[[Beau Sabreur]]'' with [[Evelyn Brent]],  ''[[Doomsday (1928 film)|Doomsday]]'' with [[Florence Vidor]], ''[[Half a Bride]]'' with [[Esther Ralston]], and ''[[Lilac Time (1928 film)|Lilac Time]]'' with [[Colleen Moore]].<ref name="swindell-98-99">Swindell 1980, pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref> The latter film, which introduced synchronized music and sound effects, became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.<ref name="swindell-98-99"/>

Cooper became a major film star in 1929 with the release of his first sound picture ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'', which was directed by [[Victor Fleming]] and co-starred [[Walter Huston]] as the villainous Trampas.<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 68<U+2013>70.</ref> Based on the popular [[The Virginian (novel)|novel]] by [[Owen Wister]], ''The Virginian'' was one of the first sound films to define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions of the Western movie genre that have lasted to the present day.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 51<U+2013>52.</ref> The romantic image of the tall, handsome, and shy cowboy hero that embodied male freedom, courage, and honor was created in large part by Cooper's performance in the film.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref> Unlike some silent film actors who could not adapt to the new sound medium, Cooper transitioned naturally, with his deep, clear, and pleasantly drawling voice, which was perfectly suited for the characters he portrayed on screen.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 49.</ref> Looking to capitalize on Cooper's growing popularity, Paramount cast him in several Westerns and [[War film|wartime drama films]] in 1930, including ''[[Only the Brave (1930 film)|Only the Brave]]'', ''[[The Texan (film)|The Texan]]'', ''[[Seven Days' Leave (1930 film)|Seven Days' Leave]]'', ''[[A Man from Wyoming]]'', and ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]''.<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 70<U+2013>84.</ref>

One of the high points of Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen [[French Foreign Legion|legionnaire]] in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s 1930 film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]''<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 61.</ref> with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in her introduction to American audiences.<ref name="dickens-9">Dickens 1970, p. 9.</ref> During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively.<ref name="dickens-9"/> Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German.

===Friendships, interests, and character===
{{Quote box|width=33% |align=right |quote="For me the really satisfying things I do are offered me, free, for nothing. Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting?

Cooper's twenty-year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in the fall of 1940.<ref name="meyers-173">Meyers 1998, p. 173.</ref> The previous year, Hemingway drew upon Cooper's image when he created the character of Robert Jordon for the novel ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name="meyers-176">Meyers 1998, p. 176.</ref> The two shared a passion for the outdoors,<ref name="meyers-173"/> and for many years they hunted duck and pheasant together in Sun Valley in the fall and skied together in the winter. Both men admired the work of [[Rudyard Kipling]]<U+2014>Cooper kept a copy of the poem "[[If<U+2014>]]" in his dressing room<U+2014>and retained as adults Kipling's sense of boyish adventure.<ref name="meyers-175">Meyers 1998, p. 175.</ref> In addition to admiring Cooper's knowledge of the outdoors and hunting skills, Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona,<ref name="meyers-173"/> once telling a friend, "If you made up a character like Coop, nobody would believe it.

===Political views===
Cooper was a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] like his father, and had voted for [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928 and 1932, and had campaigned for [[Wendell Willkie]] in 1940.<ref name="meyers-202">Meyers 1998, p. 202.</ref> When [[Franklin D.

==Acting style and reputation==
{{Quote box|width=33% |align=right |quote="Naturalness is hard to talk about, but I guess it boils down to this: You find out what people expect of your type of character and then you give them what they want. That way, an actor never seems unnatural or affected no matter what role he plays."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 120.</ref> |source=Gary Cooper}}
Cooper's acting style consisted of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher [[Lee Strasberg]] once observed: "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters."<ref name="meyers-156">Meyers 1998, p. 156.</ref> Film director [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]] ranked Cooper among "the greatest actors" because of his ability to deliver great performances "without direction".<ref name="meyers-156"/> This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply "playing himself".<ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 2.</ref>

Cooper's ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor [[John Barrymore]] said of Cooper, "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn<U+2014>namely, to be natural."<ref name="meyers-89"/> Actor [[Charles Laughton]], who played opposite Cooper in ''Devil and the Deep'' agreed, "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life."<ref name="meyers-89"/> William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a "superb actor, a master of movie acting".<ref>Dickens 1970, pp. 18<U+2013>19.</ref> In his review of Cooper's performance in ''The Real Glory'', author and film critic Graham Greene wrote, "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no question here of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera<U+2014>the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore."<ref name="meyers-89"/>

Cooper's style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements.<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> Commenting on Cooper's performance in ''Sergeant York'', director Howard Hawks observed, "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't going to be any good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 153.</ref> Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in ''Pride of the Yankees'', noting, "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 165.</ref> His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering<U+2014>and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with."<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 179.</ref>

Cooper's career spanned thirty-six years, from 1925 to 1961.<ref name="dickens-2">Dickens 1970, p. 2.</ref> During that time, he appeared in eighty-four feature films in a leading role.<ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 1.</ref> He was a major [[movie star]] from the end of the [[silent films|silent film era]] to the end of the golden age of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classical Hollywood]]. His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women,<ref>Meyers 1998, p. xi.</ref> and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres, including Westerns, war films, adventure films, drama films, crime films, romance films, comedy films, and romantic comedy films. He appeared on the ''Motion Picture Herald'' exhibitors poll of top ten film personalities for twenty-three consecutive years, from 1936 to 1958.<ref name="arce-147"/> According to Quigley's annual Top Ten Money Making Stars poll, Cooper was one of the top money-making stars for eighteen years, appearing in the top ten in 1936<U+2013>37, 1941<U+2013>49, and 1951<U+2013>57.<ref name="quigley"/> He topped the list in 1953.<ref name="quigley"/> In Quigley's Top Ten All-Time Poll of Money-Making Stars, Cooper is listed fourth, after John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Tom Cruise.<ref name="quigley"/> At the time of his death, it was estimated that his films grossed well over $200 million<ref name="dickens-2"/> (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000000|1961}}}} today).

In over half of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers<U+2014>all men of action.<ref name="kaminsky-2">Kaminsky 1979, p. 2.</ref> In the rest he played a wide range of characters, included doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players.<ref name="kaminsky-2"/> Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career.<ref name="kaminsky-219">Kaminsky 1979, p. 219.</ref> In his early films (1925<U+2013>30), he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (''The Virginian'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> After becoming a major star (1930<U+2013>36), his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero unwilling to commit himself to others (''Morocco'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> During the height of his career (1936<U+2013>43), he played a new type of hero<U+2014>a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (''Mr. Deeds'', ''Meet John Doe'', and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'').<ref name="kaminsky-219"/> In the post-war years (1944<U+2013>55), Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (''The Fountainhead'', ''High Noon'', and ''Billy Mitchell'').<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 219<U+2013>220.</ref> In his final films (1956<U+2013>61), Cooper's hero rejects the violence of his past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (''Friendly Persuasion'' and ''Man of the West'').<ref>Kaminsky 1979, pp. 220<U+2013>221.</ref> The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero<U+2014>a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity<ref>Dickens 1970, p. 1.</ref> who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 324.</ref>

On February 6, 1960, Cooper was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry.<ref name="walk-of-fame"/> He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana.<ref name="swmm-kinnaman"/> On May 6, 1961, he was awarded the French [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]] in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts.<ref>Meyers 1998, p. 308.</ref> On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the [[David di Donatello]] Special Award in Italy for his career achievements.<ref name="david"/> In 1966, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City.<ref name="ncm"/> The [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|fifty greatest male screen legends]].<ref name="afi-stars"/> In addition, three of his character<U+2014>Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York<U+2014>made AFI's list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|one hundred greatest heroes and villains]], all of them as heroes.<ref name="afi-heroes"/> His Lou Gehrig line, "Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth," is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie quote of all time.<ref name="afi-quotes"/> More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy is his image of that ideal American hero film audiences still find so attractive and compelling.<ref>Meyers 1998, pp. 323<U+2013>324.</ref> Charlton Heston once observed, "He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived."<ref>Kaminsky 1979, p. 206.</ref>
