'''Phillip Martin Simms''' (born [[November 3]], [[1955]], in [[Lebanon, Kentucky]]) is a retired [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and currently a [[television]] [[sportscaster]] for the [[CBS]] network. After a standout career at [[Morehead State University]], Simms was drafted in the first round by the [[New York Giants]] with the number seven selection overall in the [[1979 NFL Draft]]. Simms played his entire professional career with the Giants and was named [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) of [[Super Bowl XXI]], after he led the Giants to a 39<U+2013>20 victory over the Denver Broncos. He also was named to the [[NFL Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] for his performances in the 1985 and 1993 seasons. He finished his career with over 33,000 passing yards and has since gone on to a successful as a broadcaster of NFL games, first with [[NBC]] and currently with [[CBS]]. He is the father of current [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Chris Simms]]. 

==Early life and rookie season==
Simms was born on his grandfather's farm, a place now called Maple Hill Manor in [[Washington County, Kentucky]].  While an [[elementary school]] student the family moved and Simms grew up in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], later starting his NFL career when drafted out of [[Morehead State University]], in the first round of the [[1979 NFL Draft]], by the [[New York Giants]].      

Before the [[1979 NFL Draft]], [[Bill Walsh (football coach)|Bill Walsh]], who was the new coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]], flew to Morehead State with Assistant Coach [[Sam Wyche]] to work out Simms.<ref> Simms and Meier. pgs. 74<U+2013>75 </ref> Walsh was so impressed with the young quarterback that he planned to draft Phil in the 3rd round, actually preferring him over another young quarterback they scouted and ultimately drafted, [[Joe Montana]].<ref name="Sports Illustrated">King, Peter. The Rating Game, ''Sports Illustrated'' Volume: 95 issue 8 pg. 60 [[2001-08-27]] ISSN: 0038 - 822X </ref> But the [[New York Giants]] decided to make Simms their first round pick to the surprise of many.<ref name="Simms">Katz, Michael. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00615FE3F5D12728DDDAC0894DD405B898BF1D3 Giants Defend 'Value' in Choice of Simms; Perkins Optimistic Giants Selections], ''The New York Times'', [[May 5]], [[1979]], accessed [[March 20]], [[2007]]. </ref> As Simms acknowledged, "[m]ost people have never heard of me."<ref name="Simms"/> When Simms's name was announced by Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], his selection was booed loudly by Giants fans, something he would get used to in his early Giant years. However, he became more popular with his teammates who jokingly dubbed him "[[Prince Valiant]]" in his rookie training camp.<ref>Katz, Michael. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D10FD3F5D12728DDDA80994DD405B898BF1D3 Giants Test Simms in A Workout; Pisarcik Overweight], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[May 11]], [[1979]], accessed [[March 20]], [[2007]]. </ref>

Simms won his first five starts of his rookie year.<ref name="Rovell">Rovell, Darren. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1915377 Roethlisberger in demand], [[espn.com]], [[November 4]], [[2004]], accessed [[2007-01-01]]. </ref> He led the team to a 6<U+2013>4 record as a starter, throwing for 1,743&nbsp;yards and 13 [[touchdown]] passes and was named to the NFL All Rookie Team. According to his [[1981 NFL season|1981]] [[Topps]] card, he was runner-up in [[1979 NFL season|1979]] for [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], losing out to future teammate, [[Ottis Anderson]].<ref name="1981 Topps Football">Topps Football (1981). ''Card #55''. </ref>   

===Early career: 1980-1986===
Simm's next four years were marred by injuries and inconsistent play. He finished the [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]] with 15 touchdowns and 19 [[interception (football)|interceptions]], while completing a subpar 48.0% of his passes for 2,321&nbsp;yards.<ref name="dbf"/> In 1981, Simms threw for 2,031&nbsp;yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on 54.4% [[completion percentage]]<ref name="dbf"/> before suffering a separated shoulder in a [[November 15]] loss to the [[Washington Redskins]].<ref> Neft, Cohen, and Korch. pg. 724 </ref> With Simms out, the Giants went on a run led by [[Scott Brunner]] and advanced to the second round of the playoffs. Simms suffered a torn knee ligament in a preseason game against the [[New York Jets]], preventing him from playing the entire [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]. After the 1982 season Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same postion at the [[University of Alabama]]. His replacement was the team's [[defensive coordinator]] [[Bill Parcells]]. In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms.

One of Parcells first decisions as coach was to replace Simms as the team's starting quarterback with Brunner. During the sixth game of the Giants' [[1983 NFL season|1983 Season]], Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, but according to the book, ''Simms to McConkey'', written by [[Phil McConkey]], Simms, and [[Dick Schaap]], the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, with the bone sticking out through the skin.<ref>McConkey, Simms, and Schaap. </ref>

In [[1984 NFL season|1984]], after many seasons plagued by injuries and up-and-down play, Simms finally emerged as a team offensive leader. He passed for 4,044&nbsp;yards (2nd most in NFC) and 22 touchdown passes<ref name="dbf"/> and led the Giants to a playoff berth.
He was voted to the Pro Bowl and was named Pro Bowl MVP<ref name="dbf"/> as he led the NFC to a comeback win over the AFC throwing 3 TD's. In 1985, he passed for 3,829&nbsp;yards and 22 touchdown<ref name="dbf"/> passes and led the Giants to 10 victories, the most for a Giants team since [[1963 NFL season|1963]].<ref name="NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=NYG&lg=nfl New York Giants (1925 - )], databasefootball.com, accessed [[May 9]], [[2007]]. </ref> In a game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] during the [[1985 NFL season|1985 season]], Simms passed for 513&nbsp;yards, which is the 5th most passing yards in a single game in NFL history.<ref name="NFL All-Time Passing Yards Leaders, Game">Weir, Tom. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/games/2006-11-19-bengals-saints_x.htm Palmer, Johnson have Saints singing the blues], [[USA Today|usatoday.com]], [[November 20]], [[2006]], accessed [[2007-01-03]]. </ref> In 1986, he passed for 3,487&nbsp;yards and 21 touchdown passes during a season in which the Giants won 14 games. In a game that Simms considers his favorite game, he completed a key fourth-and-17 pass to Bobby Johnson late in the game to set up [[Raul Allegre]]'s game-winning field goal, which gave the Giants a 22-20 victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]].<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, Dave.

===Super Bowl XXI===
In [[Super Bowl XXI]], the Giants met the [[Denver Broncos]]. In the biggest game of his life, Simms had one of the finest performances in Super Bowl History.<ref name="Phil Simms' Record Setting Performance">[http://www.superbowl.com/history/mvps/game/sbxxi Super Bowl MVPs], superbowl.com, accessed [[2007-01-06]]. </ref> Simms completed 22 of 25 passes, with 2 dropped passes, for 268&nbsp;yards, setting Super Bowl records for consecutive completions (10),<ref name="Super Bowl XXI"/> accuracy (88%),<ref name="Super Bowl XXI">[http://www.superbowl.com/history/recaps/game/sbxxi Super Bowl Recaps: Super Bowl XXI], superbowl.com, accessed [[2007-01-03]]. </ref> and [[passer rating]] (150.9).<ref name="SB record">[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=sbd.preview&storyId=SBD2007020129 THE DAILY Goes One-on-One With Super Bowl Analyst Phil Simms], sportsbusinessdaily.com, accessed [[May 9]] [[2007]]. </ref> In addition, he threw 3 touchdown passes and his passer rating set an NFL postseason record.<ref name="SB record"/> "This might be the best game a quarterback has ever played," Giants coach [[Bill Parcells]] later said.<ref name="ESPN.com">[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/superbowl/performances.html The List: Best Super Bowl performances], espn.com, accessed [[2007-01-01]]. </ref> Two of the most famous plays from the game were the [[Flea flicker (American football)|flea flicker]] to [[Phil McConkey]], and the touchdown pass caught by McConkey off of the fingertips of Giants [[tight end]], [[Mark Bavaro]]. The Giants defeated the Broncos 39-20, and Simms was named [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXI]]. He is credited for being the first to use the phrase [[I'm Going to Disney World!|"I'm going to Disneyland!"/"I'm going to Walt Disney World Resort!"]] following a championship victory. ([[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] produces two versions of each [[Television commercial|TV commercial]].)

===Later career: 1987-1993===
Simms performed well in the strike-shortened [[1987 NFL season]], finishing with the 2nd highest [[quarterback rating]] in the NFC.<ref name="The Football Database">[http://www.footballdb.com/stats.html?yr=1987&lg=NFL&conf=&mode=P 1987 NFL Statistic - Passing], footballdb.com, accessed [[2007-01-01]]. </ref> He threw for 2,230&nbsp;yards, 9 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions.<ref name="dbf"/> He passed for 3,359&nbsp;yard, 21 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions while completing 54.9% of his passes in the 1988 season.<ref name="dbf"/> The Giants rebounded from a 6<U+2013>9<U+2013>1 record in 1987 to finish 10<U+2013>6<ref name="NYG"/> but missed the playoffs due to the NFL [[NFL playoffs#Current playoff system|tie-breaker system]]. In 1988, the Giants started 8<U+2013>1 and finished 12<U+2013>4, Simms passed for 3,061&nbsp;yards, 14 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions on 56.3% completion percentage.<ref name="dbf"/> Simms struggled in the Giants playoff game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] however, and the Giants lost 19<U+2013>13. In [[1990 NFL season|1990]], Simms was having one of his finest seasons, leading the NFC with the highest [[quarterback rating]] (92.7)<ref name="The Football Database2">[http://www.footballdb.com/stats.html?yr=1990&lg=NFL 1990 NFL Statistic - Passing], footballdb.com, accessed [[2007-01-01]]. </ref> and the Giants to an 11<U+2013>3 record. But his season was cut short due to a broken foot suffered in the fourteenth game against the Giants' eventual [[Super Bowl XXV]] opponent, the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The Giants went on to defeat the Bills 20<U+2013>19 in the Super Bowl.

After the Giants Super Bowl victory, Parcells resigned and was replaced by the team's [[offensive coordinator]] [[Ray Handley]]. One of Handley's first decisions was to select [[Jeff Hostetler]], who had quarterbacked the team to a victory in Super Bowl XXV, as the team's starting quarterback. Simms played in a total of ten games over the bext two seasons (1991<U+2013>92) and threw for 1,905&nbsp;yards, 13 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions while completing 59.3% of his passes,<ref name="dbf"/> while the team struggled to 8<U+2013>8 and 6<U+2013>10 finishes.<ref name="NYG"/> Following the season, Handley was replaced former Broncos coach [[Dan Reeves]], who immediately released Hostetler and named Simms the team's starting quarterback.<ref>Smith, Timothy W. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00615FE385F0C758DDDAF0894DB494D81 FOOTBALL; Giants Tell Simms That He's The Boss], ''The New York Times'', [[June 16]], [[1993]], accessed [[May 9]], [[2007]]. </ref> He started all 16 games in 1993, being one of only seven quarterbacks to do so, and led the Giants to a resurgent 11<U+2013>5 season including a victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the playoffs.<ref name="1993NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&yr=1993&lg=nfl 1993 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed [[May 9]] [[2007]]. </ref> However, Simms underwent shoulder surgery after the [[1993 NFL Season]] to repair a torn [[labrum]]. The surgery was successful, and team doctor Russell F. Warren's prognosis for recovery was excellent, and Simms was expected to be ready in time for training camp.<ref name="The New York Times Online Archives">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E1DC123AF931A35750C0A962958260 title=PRO FOOTBALL; Simms's Surgery Goes Well], ''The New York Times'', [[March 2]] [[1994]], accessed [[2007-01-01]]. </ref> However, later during that offseason, Simms was released by the Giants. He subsequently decided to retire.

===Career statistics===
In his 14 seasons with the Giants, Simms completed 2,576 out of 4,647 passes for 33,462&nbsp;yards and 199 touchdowns.<ref name="dbf">[http://databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=SIMMSPHI01 Phil Simms], databasefootball.com, accessed [[May 9]], [[2007]]. </ref> His career passing yardage total ranks him twentieth in NFL history.<ref name="All-Time Passing Yardage Leaders">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/alltime/leaders?cat=passyards NFL All-Time Passing Yardage Leaders], espn.com, accessed [[2007-01-02]]. </ref> He added 349 carries for 1,252 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns on the ground.<ref name="dbf"/> Simms owns many of the New York Giants passing records, along with [[Kerry Collins]]. He set team records for most passes completed and attempted in one game (40 and 62, respectively), season (286, 533) and career (2,576, 4,647), most career touchdown passes (199) and most 300-yard games in a career (21).<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/writers/simms Phil SImms], [[NFL.com]], accessed [[May 9]] [[2007]]. </ref> [[Sports Illustrated]] considered him to be the "Most Underrated Quarterback" in NFL History in their [[August 27]], [[2001]] issue entitled, "The Most Overrated and Underrated".<ref name="Sports Illustrated"/>

==Life off the field==
[[Image:Simms to LT.jpg|thumb|Taylor sprints out for the ceremonial pass from Simms.]]
On [[September 4]], [[1995]], Simms' jersey was retired in a halftime ceremony of a game versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated that he wanted to don his jersey one final time, and throw "one more pass" to teammate [[Lawrence Taylor]].<ref>[http://media.espn.com/MediaZone/PressKits/NFL2005/MNF_list.htm MNF 36: The List Monday Night Football Special (Original Air Date: Aug. 25, 2005)], espn.com, accessed [[January 12]], [[2007]]. </ref> Simms later commented, "[a]ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got [[dress shoes]] and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."<ref name="NFL">[[NFL Films]], [[NFL Network]], accessed [[April 22]], [[2007]]. </ref> Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern and after 30<U+2013>40&nbsp;yards threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way up the other side of the river because there ain't no way I'm going to be able to stay in that stadium'."<ref name="NFL"/> Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval.<ref>George, Thomas. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60611FB3D5D0C768CDDA00894DD494D81 ON PRO FOOTBALL; The Giants' Best Play Of the Dallas Game Was Simms to L. T.], ''The New York Times'', [[September 5]], [[1995]], accessed [[April 22]], [[2007]]. </ref> Since he has been retired for more than 5 years, Simms is eligible for selection into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]; he has yet to be inducted, however.

After his retirement as a player in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], Simms went on to join [[NFL on NBC|NBC's lead broadcast crew]], teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Paul Maguire]] on that network's coverage of [[Super Bowl XXX]] and [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], he moved to CBS, teaming first with [[Greg Gumbel]] and currently with [[Jim Nantz]] on the [[NFL on CBS|CBS's lead broadcast team]].
Prior to the 2006 election campaign, some bloggers suggested that Simms seek the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[U.S. Senator]] from New Jersey, comparing his appeal to former New Jersey Senator [[Bill Bradley]]. The entry of [[Thomas Kean, Jr.]] to the 2006 senate race ended this speculation. 

Phil is married to Diana, and they have three children: [[Chris Simms|Chris]] (currently a quarterback for the Tampa bay Buccaneers), Deirdre, and Matthew.
