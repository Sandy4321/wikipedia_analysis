'''Hotep Idris Galeta''' (7 June 1941 <U+2013> 3 November 2010) was a [[South Africa]]n [[jazz]] [[pianist]] and educator. His legal name at birth was '''Cecil Galeta''', but  according to local custom he was more commonly known as a child and young man as '''Cecil Barnard''', his father's first name being used instead of a last name.

In his teens he played with some of the best jazz musicians in South Africa; [[Abdullah Ibrahim]] (then known as Dollar Brand) and [[Lamie Zukufu]] introduced him to [[bebop]] and [[hard bop]]<ref name="aaj">{{cite web|title =Hotep Idris Galeta Takes It Home |first=Nils|last=Jacobson |publisher=All About Jazz| url =http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=846 |date =2003-11-15 |accessdate =2010-10-31}}</ref>. In 1961 he left South Africa clandestinely, following many other South African performers to the [[United Kingdom]] (severe restrictions on public gatherings following the [[Sharpeville massacre]] had made entertainment careers impossible for any but white artists, and the already poor quality of life for non-whites was deteriorating rapidly as [[apartheid]] became ever stricter). After a year in the United Kingdom he moved to the [[United States]], where he remained till 1991, when he returned to South Africa following the collapse of apartheid.

In the United States he played and recorded with [[Herb Alpert]], [[John Handy]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Hugh Masekela]]<ref name="aaj" />, [[Jackie McLean]], [[Mario Pavone]], [[Joshua Redman]], and [[Archie Shepp]]. Outside jazz he performed and recorded with [[David Crosby]] and the [[Byrds]]. 

In 1985, Jackie McLean invited him to teach at [[The Hartt School]] of the [[University of Hartford]], where he taught until his return to South Africa<ref name="aaj" />. He continued to record, perform, and teach in South Africa. His teaching engagements included four years on the faculty of the [[University of Fort Hare]], the musical directorship of a national music education program for high schools, and co-ordination of music outreach programs in [[Cape Town]]. He was also Project Manager for the establishment of a school of jazz and a multi media audio visual production center at the [[University of Fort Hare]]'s new urban campus in the east coast South African city of [[East London, South Africa|East London]] in the [[Eastern Cape Province]]<ref>{{cite web|title =Galeta, Hotep Idris (South Africa) |publisher=music.org.za| url =http://www.music.org.za/artist.asp?id=90 |accessdate =2010-10-31}}</ref>.
