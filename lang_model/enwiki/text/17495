==Plot summary==
{{Spoilers}}
The film follows twenty-two year-old S<U+00E9>bastien, a Georgian immigrant living in France and working construction jobs to support his poor family. S<U+00E9>bastien works on the home of Godon, a feeble [[morphine]]-addict who is under police surveillance. After Godon dies of an [[Drug overdose|overdose]], his widow informs S<U+00E9>bastien that she is unable to pay him. S<U+00E9>bastien then overhears the widow talking with one of Godon's friends, describing a mysterious "job" that Godon had lined up before his death. The destitute S<U+00E9>bastien steals an envelope containing the instructions for the job. The police begin following S<U+00E9>bastien as he uses the train ticket contained in the envelope.

The police lose track of S<U+00E9>bastien as he follows the instructions and is brought to a secluded house in a forest. At the house, a deadly gambling event is being organized by a powerful criminal. Though S<U+00E9>bastien's contacts immediately recognize that he is not Godon and has no idea what he is getting into, they force him to participate in the game. Thirteen men identified by number must undergo a series of [[Russian roulette]] games, arranging themselves into a circle and pointing their revolver at the man in front of them. Spectators place bets on who will survive. S<U+00E9>bastien, as #13, survives the first round and fires his gun only after threatened with death. On the second round, in which two bullets are placed in each gun, S<U+00E9>bastien survives only because the man behind him is killed before he could fire. On the third round, with three bullets in each gun, Sebastien survives along with three other men.

Though he believes that he is finished, S<U+00E9>bastien is selected for the final "duel" game against #6, a cruel man who is managed by his own brother. S<U+00E9>bastien wins the duel and survives the game. He collects a small fraction of the winnings his handlers have made from him and flees the house. Fearing for his life, he sends the money home in a parcel before the police catch up with him. He tells the detective that he was turned away from the game and received no money, but gives the license plate number of a particularly odious gambler in attendance. The police release him, but the brother of #6 spots him as he boards a train. The brother shoots S<U+00E9>bastien and steals his empty satchel. S<U+00E9>bastien collapses into a seat and dies as the train begins to move.
