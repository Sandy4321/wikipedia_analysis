==Career==
===Singing===
At the age of 12 he [[Audition (performing arts)|audition]]ed for the chance to perform onstage with the hugely successful S Club 7.  Chosen from 12,000 hopefuls live on the BBC, the band were originally only supposed to be supporting S Club 7 on their Carnival tour but after such an incredible public response the band "S Club Juniors" were formed and had instant chart success with their first single ''One Step Closer'' reaching #2 in the UK charts. 

He was part of an 8-piece pop band signed to Simon Fullers 19 Management and [[Universal Records]] subsidy [[Polydor]].  As S Club Juniors, the band had four top 10 singles and a platinum top 5 album ''Together'' and in 2003 had a tour of their own "S Club United Tour" performing their infectious blend of pop music and slick dance routines to sold-out arenas across the UK and [[Ireland]].  To top the year off, the Juniors won "best newcomer" at the [[Disney Channel]] Kids Awards. 

After having been in the music industry for almost 2 years, and after the disbandment of [[S Club 7]], the band was re-named "S Club 8" and it had another hit album ''Sundown'' which produced three further top 20 singles, proving its staying power with a minor UK following. 

In 2004 the band spent 3 months in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], filming a children<U+2019>s BBC television programme ''[[I Dream]]'' which was about a group of kids winning a place at a secret stage school where they all played themselves and starred alongside [[Christopher Lloyd]].  Calvin said, "It was an amazing experience to be filming a show with one of my idols; [[Back to The Future]] is one of my all time favourite movies."  The show was an instant hit in the UK, and is now on screens across [[Europe]] and [[Australia]].  An album, ''Welcome To Avalon Heights'' was released to accompany the series, along with a duet from Frankie and Calvin, "Dreaming" which was to be their last single.
