The '''Tasman Booby''' ('''''Sula (dactylatra) tasmani''''') was a large [[seabird]] of the [[gannet]] family, [[Sulidae]], described from bones found on [[Norfolk Island|Norfolk]] and [[Lord Howe Island]]s in the [[Tasman Sea]] (van Tets ''et al'' 1988) that was believed to have become extinct in the late [[18th Century]] or early [[19th Century]] on Lord Howe Island because of predation by visiting sailors, with the last sight record dating from [[1788]], being already extinct on Norfolk Island.

However, this taxon has more recently (Priddel ''et al'' 2005) been considered to be a [[subspecies]] of the [[Masked Booby]], ''Sula dactylatra tasmani'', still extant as a breeding species on Lord Howe Island.  Holdaway & Anderson (2001) attribute subfossil material from Norfolk Island simply to ''Sula dactylatra''.
