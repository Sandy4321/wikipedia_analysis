'''Naji Salim al-Ali''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0646><U+0627><U+062C><U+064A> <U+0633><U+0644><U+064A><U+0645> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+0644><U+064A>}} ''{{transl|ar|N<U+0101>j<U+012B> Sal<U+012B>m al-<U+2018>Al<U+012B>&nbsp;}}''; born c. 1938 <U+2013> 29 August 1987) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[editorial cartoon|cartoonist]], noted for the political criticism of  the Arab regimes and Israel in his works.
He drew over 40,000 cartoons, which often reflected [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and [[Arab]] public opinion and were sharply critical commentaries on Palestinian and Arab politics and political leaders.<ref name=farsoun>Farsoun, 2004, p. 111.</ref> He is perhaps best known as creator of the character [[Handala]], pictured in his cartoons as a young witness of the satirized policy or event depicted,<ref name=farsoun/> and who has since become an icon of Palestinian defiance.

==Early life==
Naji al-Ali was born in 1938 or thereabouts in the northern Palestinian village of [[Al-Shajara]], located between [[Tiberias]] and [[Nazareth]] and now over-built by the Israeli settlement of [[Ilanya]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} He was exiled in the south of [[Lebanon]] with his family after the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] (the Nakba), and lived in [[Ain al-Hilweh]] [[refugee camp]] near [[Sidon]],<ref name=harlow2>Harlow, 1994, p. 168.</ref> where he attended the Union of Christian Churches school. After gaining his ''Certificat'' he worked in the orchards of Sidon, then moved to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] where he attended the White Friars' vocational school for two years.

Naji al-Ali then moved to [[Beirut]], where he lived in a tent in [[Shatila refugee camp]] and worked in various industrial jobs. In 1957, after qualifying as a car mechanic, he travelled to [[Saudi Arabia]], where he worked for two years.

==Career as a cartoonist and journalist==
In 1959 Naji al-Ali returned to Lebanon, and that year he joined the [[Arab Nationalist Movement]] (ANM), but was expelled four times within one year for lack of party discipline. Between 1960 and 1961, along with comrades from the ANM, he published a handwritten political journal ''Al-Sarkha'' ('the cry').

In 1960, he entered the [[Lebanon Academy of Arts]], but was unable to continue his studies there as he was imprisoned for political reasons soon afterwards. After his release he moved to [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], where he worked as a drawing instructor in the [[Ja'fariya College]].

The writer and political activist [[Ghassan Kanafani]] saw some of Naji al-Ali's cartoons on a visit to Ain al-Hilweh and printed the artist's first published drawings along with an accompanying article in [[Al-Hurriya]] no. 88 on 25 September 1961.

In 1963 Naji al-Ali moved to [[Kuwait]], hoping to save money to study art in [[Cairo]] or [[Rome]]. There he worked as an editor, cartoonist, designer and newspaper producer on the Arab nationalist ''[[Al-Tali'a]]'' newspaper. From 1968 on he worked for ''[[Al-Siyasa]]''. In the course of these years he returned to Lebanon several times. In 1974 he started working for the Lebanese newspaper ''[[Al-Safir]]'', which permitted him to return to Lebanon for a longer period. During the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, he was briefly detained by the occupying forces along with other residents of Ain al-Hilweh. In 1983 he once more moved to Kuwait to work for ''Al-Qabas'' and in 1985 moved to London where he worked for its international edition until his death.

In 1984 he was described by ''The Guardian'' as "the nearest thing there is to an Arab public opinion".<ref>Haifaa Khalafallah, 'Third World Review: This pen is mightier... Profile of Naji al-Ali, Arab cartoonist', ''The Guardian'', September 21, 1984.</ref>

==Work, positions and awards==
In his career as a [[editorial cartoonist|political cartoonist]], Naji al-Ali produced over 40,000 drawings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} They generally deal with the situation of the Palestinian people, depicting suffering and resistance and harshly criticizing the Israeli state and "illegal Israeli occupation," Palestinian leadership, and the Arab regimes. Naji al-Ali was a fierce opponent of any settlement that would not vindicate the Palestinian people's right to all of historic Palestine, and many of his cartoons express this position. Unlike many political cartoonists, specific politicians do not appear in person in his work: as he stated, "... I have a class outlook, that is why my cartoons take this form. What is important is drawing situations and realities, not drawing presidents and leaders."{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Naji al-Ali published three books of his cartoons, in 1976, 1983 and 1985, and was preparing another at the time of his death.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 1979, Naji al-Ali was elected president of the [[League of Arab Cartoonists]]. In 1979 and 1980, he received the first prize in the Arab cartoonists exhibitions held in [[Damascus]]. The [[International Federation of Newspaper Publishers]] awarded him the "Golden Pen of Freedom" posthumously in 1988.<ref>'Murdered Arab cartoonist honoured', ''The Guardian'', February 8, 1988.</ref>

==Handala==
[[Image:Handala.gif|thumb|120px|Handala, the Palestinian defiance symbol]]
Handala, also known as Handhala ({{lang-ar|<U+062D><U+0646><U+0638><U+0644><U+0629>}}), is the most famous of Naji al-Ali's characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
He is depicted as a ten-year old boy, and appeared for the first time in ''Al-Siyasa'' in [[Kuwait]] in 1969.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
The figure turned his back to the viewer from the year 1973, and clasped his hands behind his back.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
The artist explained that the ten-year old represented his age when forced to leave Palestine and would not grow up until he could return to his homeland; his turned back and clasped hands symbolised the character's rejection of "outside solutions".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Handala wears ragged clothes and is barefoot, symbolising his allegiance to the poor. In later cartoons, he is actively participating in the action depicted not merely observing it.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Handala became the signature of Naji al-Ali's cartoons and remains an iconic symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. Handala has also been used as the web mascot of the [[Iranian Green Movement|Iranian green movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=QODS DAY: Protesters Transform Jerusalem Day Into Iran Day|author=Shirin Sadeghi|date=2009-09-18 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shirin-sadeghi/qods-day-protesters-trans_b_291220.html}}</ref> The artist remarked that "this being that I have invented will certainly not cease to exist after me, and perhaps it is no exaggeration to say that I will live on with him after my death"....{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other characters and motifs==
Other characters in Naji al-Ali's cartoons include a thin, miserable-looking man representing the Palestinian as the defiant victim of Israeli oppression and other hostile forces, and a fat man representing the Arab regimes and Palestinian political leaders who led an easy life and engaged in political compromises which the artist fervently opposed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The motifs of the [[Crucifixion]] (representing Palestinian suffering) and stone-throwing (representing the resistance of ordinary Palestinians) are also common in his work.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Assassination==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Al-Qabas - Naji al-Ali.jpg|thumb|100px|[[al-Qabas]] coverpage the morning after Naji was shot]] -->
It is still not known who opened fire on Naji al-Ali outside the [[London]] office of Kuwaiti newspaper [[Al Qabas]] on the 22 July 1987, hitting him in the right temple.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Naji al-Ali remained unconscious until his death on 29 August 1987. Although his will requested that he be buried in Ain al-Hilweh beside his father, this proved impossible to arrange and he was buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery|Brookwood Islamic Cemetery]] outside London. [[Scotland Yard|British police]] arrested [[Ismail Sowan]], a 28-year-old Jerusalem-born Palestinian researcher at [[Hull University]], and found a cache of weapons in his apartment that they said were intended for terrorist attacks around Europe; he was only charged with [[Weapon possession (crime)|possession of weapons]] and explosives. Initially, police said Sawan was a member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], though that organisation denied any involvement.<ref>David Pallister, 'Arab on arms find charge', ''The Guardian'', August 18, 1987.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71239F933A0575BC0A961948260| title=Palestinian Journalist Dies of Wounds in London| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=August 30, 1987}}</ref>

Sawan later confessed that he worked for both the PLO and the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]].<ref>Clines, Francis (18 June 1988) "[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/18/world/britain-orders-israeli-diplomat-to-leave.html?scp=1&sq=Ishmail%20Hassan%20Sowan&st=cse Britain Orders Israeli Diplomat to Leave.]" ''The New York Times''.

===Commemorative statue===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
[[Image:Naji Statue.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Naji statue when it was first erected (right), exploded and damaged, and then re-erected]]
A statue of Naji al-Ali by the sculptor [[Charbel Faris]] was erected at the northern entrance of Ain al-Hilweh camp, where Naji was raised for most of his youth years and presumably where he got most of his inspirations.

Work on the [[fiberglass]] and colored [[polyester]] statue (with a steel inner support) took around five months. When finished, it was {{convert|275|cm|ft}} tall, with an average width of {{convert|85|cm|in}}, and average thickness of {{convert|45|cm|in}}. The statue holds a rock in its right hand and a booklet of drawings in the left hand.

Shortly after being completed, the statue was damaged in an explosion caused by unknown assailants; like al-Ali the statue was shot in the left eye.

The statue was repaired and re-erected, but has subsequently disappeared.
