'''Siward''' or '''Sigurd''' ([[Old English]]: ''Sigeweard'')<ref>The English name Siward or '''Sigeweard''' was cognate to the single Old Norse name written variously as ''Sigvar<U+00F0>r'' and ''Sigur<U+00F0>r''; see Holman, ''Northern Conquest'', p. 103; Munch (ed.), ''Chronica regum Manniae et Insularum'', vol. i, p. 140; Stevenson, ''Simeon of Durham'', p. 119</ref>  was a great [[earl]] of 11th-century northern England. The [[Old Norse]] nickname ''Digri'' and its Latin translation ''Grossus'' ("the stout") are given to him by near-contemporary texts.<ref>Barlow (ed.), ''Life of King Edward'', p. 35 (= ''Vita <U+00C6>dwardi'', i. 3); Aird, "Siward"; see also reference in on the ''Vita Waldevi'' below</ref>  Siward was probably of [[Scandinavia]]n origin, perhaps a member of [[Earl Ulf]]'s [[Kinship|kindred]], and emerged as a powerful regional strongman in England during the reign of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] ("Canute the Great", 1016&ndash;1035). Cnut was a Scandinavian ruler who conquered England in the 1010s, and Siward was one of the many Scandinavians who came to England in the aftermath of that conquest. Siward subsequently rose to become sub-ruler of most of northern England. From 1033 at the latest Siward was in control of southern [[Northumbria]], that is, present-day [[Yorkshire]], governing as earl on Cnut's behalf. 

He entrenched his position in northern England by marrying <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d, the daughter of [[Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh|Ealdred]], [[Earl of Bamburgh]]. After killing Ealdred's successor [[Eadwulf III of Bamburgh|Eadulf]] in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings [[Harthacnut]] and [[Edward the Confessor|Edward]], assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle [[shire]]s of [[Northampton]] and [[Huntingdon]] by the 1050s, and there is some evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into [[Cumberland]]. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler [[Mac Bethad mac Findla<U+00ED>ch]] ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son [[Osbjorn Bulax|Osbjorn]] a year previously, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''. Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]], who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. [[St Olave's Church, York|St Olaf's church]] in [[York]] and nearby [[Heslington Hill]] are associated with Siward.

Source material on Siward's life and career is scarce, and only a small and potentially unrepresentative amount of information exists. No contemporary or near-contemporary biography has survived, and narratives from around the time of his life such as the ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' and the ''[[Vita <U+00C6>dwardi Regis]]'' scarcely mention him; historians are therefore dependent on a few entries in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and comparable Irish sources. Later [[Anglo-Norman]] histories may or may not be reliable depending on their source material, but useful ones include the ''Chronicle'' of [[John of Worcester]] (compiled between 1124 and 1140),<ref>Gransden, ''Historical Writing'', p. 144</ref> [[William of Malmesbury]] (writing between c. 1125 and 1142),<ref>Thomson, "Malmesbury, William of"</ref> [[Henry of Huntingdon]] (writing between c. 1133 and 1154),<ref>Gransden, ''Historical Writing'', p. 194</ref> and [[Orderic Vitalis]] (writing between c. 1114 and 1141).<ref>Gransden, ''Historical Writing'', p. 152</ref> Other sources<ref>For source discussion in this period, see Lawson, ''Cnut'', pp. 39&ndash;80 and Gransden, ''Historical Writing'', passim; for particular relevant analysis, see sources used by Duncan, ''Kingship'', pp. 33&ndash;43 and Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 248&ndash;71</ref> include the material attributed to [[Symeon of Durham]] (compiled and written as extant between the late 1000s and the first half of the 1100s).<ref>The texts in question are the ''[[Historia Regum]]'', the ''[[Libellus de exordio]]'', ''[[De primo Saxonum adventu]]'' and ''[[De obsessione Dunelmi]]''; the ''Libellus de exordio'' is likely to have been "authored" by Symeon; see Rollason, ''Symeon of Durham'', pp. xlii&ndash;l, lxxvii&ndash;xci, et passim, for a recent discussion</ref>  Legendary material, such as that in [[hagiography]] or later medieval sources such as [[John of Fordun]] or [[Andrew of Wyntoun]], is not generally regarded as useful beyond its limited potential for cleanly preserving earlier source material.<ref>Duncan, ''Kingship'', passim; Broun, ''Scottish Independence'', passim</ref>

==Background==
Siward's career in northern England spanned the reigns of four different monarchs. It began during the reign of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], and lasted through those of [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]] into the early years of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Most important was the reign of Cnut, in which so many new political figures rose to power that some historians think it comparable to the [[Norman conquest]] five decades later.<ref name=Fleming-ch2>E.g. Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', pp. 21&ndash;52</ref> These "new men" were military figures, usually with weak hereditary links to the West Saxon royal house that Cnut had deposed.<ref name=Fleming-ch2/> As Cnut ruled several [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in addition to England, power at the highest level was delegated to such strongmen.<ref>Lawson, ''Cnut'', pp. 81&ndash;102; Sawyer, ""Cnut's Scandinavian empire", pp. 10&ndash;22</ref> In England, it fell to a handful of newly promoted "ealdormen" or "earls", who ruled a [[shire]] or group of shires on behalf of the king.<ref>See, for a list and discussion of Cnut's earls, Keynes, "Cnut's earls", pp. 43&ndash;88; the term was, by Cnut's reign, interchangeable with the Scandinavian word [[earl]], which supplanted the former by the end of the 11th-century (Crouch, ''Image of the Aristocracy'', pp. 46&ndash;50)</ref> Siward was, in the words of historian Robin Fleming, "the third man in Cnut's new triumvirate of earls",<ref name=Fleming49>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 49</ref> the other two being [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwine]], [[Earl of Wessex]] and [[Leofwine, Earl of Mercia|Leofwine]], [[Earl of Mercia]].<ref name=Fleming49/>

Northern England in the 11th-century was a region quite distinct from the rest of the country. The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the [[Humber]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]] estuaries, northward to the [[Firth of Forth]], where, passing the western [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], it met the [[Kingdom of Alba]] (Scotland).<ref>Lewis, "Introduction", p. 6; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 232&ndash;40</ref> Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s, by King [[Eadred of England|Eadred]], and subsequent control was exerted through the agency of at least two ealdormen, one to the north and one to the south of the [[river Tees]].<ref>Rollason, ''Northumbria'', pp. 65&ndash;66; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 190, 211</ref> The former is associated with the stronghold of [[Bamburgh]], while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of [[York]].<ref>Fletcher, ''Bloodfeud'', passim; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', passim</ref> It was a politically fragmented region. The western part, from [[Lancashire]] to [[Cumberland]], was heavily settled by Norse-Gaels, while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo-Scandinavian regional magnates<U+2014>[[thegn]]s, [[Hold (title)|hold]]s and [[high-reeve]]s<U+2014>exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen.<ref>Bolton, ''Empire of Cnut'', pp. 109&ndash;18</ref> One such example was the magnate Thurbrand, a hold in Yorkshire, probably based in [[Holderness]], whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh.<ref>Bolton, ''Empire of Cnut'', pp. 114<U+2013>17 Fletcher, ''Bloodfeud'', passim</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" |"The Stories of the ancients tell us that ''Ursus'' (a certain nobleman whom the Lord, contrary to what normally happens in human procreation, allowed to be created from a white bear as a father and a noblewoman as a mother), begot ''Spratlingus''; ''Spratlingus'' begot ''Ulfius''; and ''Ulfius'' begot ''Beorn'', who was nicknamed ''Beresune'', that is, "Bear's Son". This Beorn was Danish by race, a distinguished earl and famous soldier. As a sign, however, that due to part of his ancestry he was of a different species, nature had given him the ears of his father's line, namely those of a bear. In all other features he was of his mother's appearance. And after many manly deeds and military adventures, he begot a son, a tried imitator of his father's strength and military skill. His name was Siward, nicknamed ''Diere'', that is, the Stout (''grossus'')".

Historians generally claim Siward to be of Scandinavian origin, a conclusion supported by the ''Vita <U+00C6>dwardi Regis'', which states that Siward was "[called] ''Digri'' in the Danish tongue" (''Danica lingua Digara'').<ref>Barlow (ed.), ''Life of King Edward'', pp. 34, 35</ref> Legendary material incorporated in the ''Vita et passio Waldevi comitis'' (or simply ''Vita Waldevi''), the hagiographic biography of Siward's son [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]], states that Siward was the son of a Scandinavian earl named Bjorn and provides a genealogy claiming that he was the descendant of a [[polar bear]],<ref name=SiwardOrigin>Michel, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LqJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104&vq=Incipiunt+Gesta+anteccssorum+comitis&dq=Gesta+antecessorum+comitis+Waldevi#PPA104,M1 ''Chroniques Anglo-Normandes''], vol. iii, p. 104; Rauer, ''Beowulf and the Dragon'', pp. 162<U+2013>63</ref>  a commonplace piece of Germanic folklore.<ref>For a collection of such accounts see Panzer, ''Beowulf'', vol. i, pp. 16&ndash;29; [[Axel Olrik]] noted the correspondence between Siward's genealogy and two others: [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s genealogy of King [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridsson]] of Denmark; and the genealogy of Sweyn's brother Earl Bjorn recorded by John of Worcester (Olrik, "Siward Digri", pp. 218&ndash;19, 234; Darlington, McGurk & Bray (eds.), ''Chronicle of John of Worcester'', vol. ii, pp. 548, 549; Christiansen, ''Saxo Grammaticus'', vol. i, pp. 29&ndash;30). Saxo related that [[Thorgil Sprakling]] (i.e. ''Spatlingus''), the father of [[Earl Ulf]] (i.e. ''Ulfius'') father of Bjorn and Sweyn, was similarly born from a bear (Christiansen, ''Saxo Grammaticus'', vol. i, p. 190). Saxo may have borrowed from Siward's story and genealogy when he wrote his account of Sprakling (Olrik, "Siward Digri", p. 234, noting in n. 1 that the name of Siward's son, ''Osbjorn'' ("bear spirit") strengthens the idea that Siward's father was actually called Bjorn); alternatively, the earlier version in John of Worcester may have been the source for both (Christiansen, ''Saxo Grammaticus'', vol. i, p. 190, who nevertheless believes Saxo may have had access to the ''Vita Waldevi'' or the sources behind it).</ref>

Historian Timothy Bolton has recently argued that the similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of [[Thorgil Sprakling]]. Siward would then have been first cousin to [[Earl Ulf]], the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister [[Estrid Margarete Svendsdatter|Estrith]] and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's.<ref>Bolton, "Ancestors of the Danish Royal Family?", pp. 42&ndash;71</ref> Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.<ref>Bolton, "Ancestors of the Danish Royal Family?", p. 71</ref>

The ''Vita Waldevi'' provides further legendary detail of Siward's journey from Scandinavia to England. According to the ''Vita'', Siward passed through [[Orkney]], killing a [[dragon]] there before moving on to [[Northumbria]]. There he encountered another dragon, before meeting an [[O<U+00F0>inn]]-like old man on a hill,<ref>See Rauer, ''Beowulf and the Dragon'', pp. 128, 131, for discussion of the raven banner and the old man on the hill as O<U+00F0>inn; Siward's dragon-slaying can be compared to the dragon-slaying of his namesake [[Sigurd|Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer]]</ref> who handed him a [[raven banner]] and instructed him to proceed to London to receive the patronage of the king of England.<ref>Michel, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LqJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104&vq=Incipiunt+Gesta+anteccssorum+comitis&dq=Gesta+antecessorum+comitis+Waldevi#PPA104,M1 ''Chroniques Anglo-Normandes''], vol. iii, p. 104; Rauer, ''Beowulf and the Dragon'', pp. 125&ndash;33, 162&ndash;66</ref>{{clear}}

| style="text-align: left;" |"[A]fter a short conversation the king took him [Siward] into his service, and promised him the first position of dignity which became vacant in his realm. After that Siward said farewell, and he and his men took the way back to London. On the bridge not far from the monastery [Westminster] he met the Earl of Huntingdon, Tosti, a Dane by birth; the king hated him because he had married Earl Godwine's daughter, sister to the queen. The earl crossed the foot-bridge so near Siward that he soiled his mantle with his dirty feet; for at that time it was fashionable to wear a mantle without any cord by which to hold it up. Then blood rushed to his heart; yet he checked himself from taking revenge on the spot, because the shame was inflicted upon him by one who was on his way to the king's hall. But he remained standing with his men by the same bridge until Tosti came from the king; then he drew his sword and hacked off Tosti's head, and went with it under his mantle back to the king's hall. Here he asked, according to his promise, to give him the earldom of Huntingdon. But as the earl had just left him, the king thought he was only joking. Then Siward related his deed, and, as sure proof, cast the head down before the king's feet. The king then kept his promise, and proclaimed him at once earl of Huntingdon ... A few days later, the Northmen began to attack the realm. The king then was in a state of uncertainty, and deliberated with the great men of his realm as to what means should be adopted; and they made over with one voice Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmoreland to Earl Siward, and the king invested him with earldom over them".

|}

The exact date and context of Siward's arrival in England are unknown, though the ''Vita Waldevi'' offers a legendary account.<ref>Aird, "Siward"; this account (see box) he story relates that Siward slew Tostig, and as a reward the king (Edward the Confessor) granted Siward the earldom of [[Huntingdon]]. Soon after, Siward obtained Northumbria too.; for text and translations of account, see Michel, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LqJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA104&vq=Incipiunt+Gesta+anteccssorum+comitis&dq=Gesta+antecessorum+comitis+Waldevi#PPA104,M1 ''Chroniques Anglo-Normandes''], vol. iii, pp. 107&ndash;09; Bartlett, ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', pp. 33&ndash;34; Olrik, "Siward Digri", pp. 215&ndash;16; even though there is evidence that a prominent magnate named Tostig<U+2014>but not [[Tostig Godwinson]]<U+2014>was active during the period, Edward [the Confessor] did not become king until 1042, and this story like others in the ''Vita Waldevi'' is regarded as fanciful; see Harmer, ''Anglo-Saxon Writs'', pp. 303&ndash;04</ref> Charters dating to 1019, 1024, 1032, 1033 and 1035 mention a ''Si[ge]ward Minister'', "the [[thegn]] Siward", but it is impossible to securely identify any of these names with the man who became [[Earl of Northumbria]].<ref>Keynes, "Cnut's Earls", p. 65; several of Cnut's Danish earls appear earliest with the style ''Minister'', for which see ''Ibid'', pp. 54&ndash;66</ref> The earliest certain contemporary record of Siward occurs in a charter of King Cnut to [[<U+00C6>lfric Puttoc]], [[Archbishop of York]], in 1033.<ref name=AirdKeynes>Aird, "Siward"; Keynes, "Cnut's Earls", pp. 65&ndash;66; {{citation|title=Sawyer 968|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+968| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> This charter attestation can be identified as Siward the earl because he is styled ''dux'' ("earl").<ref name=AirdKeynes/>

Although it is clear that Siward was earl by 1033, he may have attained the position somewhat earlier. His predecessor [[Eric of Hlathir|Erik of Hlathir]] last appeared in the historical sources in 1023, leaving a ten-year gap during which Siward could have taken the position.<ref>Aird, "Siward"; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 23; Fletcher, ''Bloodfeud'', p. 131; Keynes, "Cnut's Earls", p. 66; Rollason, ''Northumbria'', p. 267</ref> Although William of Malmesbury asserted that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia, Scandinavian tradition firmly maintained he died in England.<ref>Keynes, "Cnut's Earls", p. 58</ref> Historian [[William Kapelle]] believed that Erik ceased to be earl in or soon after 1023, and that Carl son of Thurbrand was appointed hold or high-reeve (''heahgerefa'') for the king in Yorkshire. Carl retained this position, it was argued, even after Siward was installed as earl a few years later, but from then on he acted as a deputy to the earl rather than to the king.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 23</ref> [[Richard A. Fletcher|Richard Fletcher]] remained agnostic on the point, although he did argue that Erik must have been dead by 1028.<ref>Fletcher, ''Bloodfeud'', pp. 121, 131</ref> Timothy Bolton, although rejecting Kapelle's argument concerning Carl son of Thurbrand, believed Erik died c. 1023 and that the earldom may have remained vacant for a period.<ref>Bolton, ''Empire of Cnut'', pp. 119&ndash;22</ref> Bolton argued that Cnut tried to rule Northumbria directly, but lost interest in this strategy, awarding the earldom to another northerner, [[Ealdred of Bamburgh|Ealdred son of Uhtred]].<ref>Bolton, ''Empire of Cnut'', pp. 122&ndash;25</ref>

When Cnut died in 1035, there were a number of rival claimants for his throne. These included his son [[Harthacnut]], and the nobleman [[Harold Harefoot]], as well as [[Alfred <U+00C6>theling]] and Edward (later, King [[Edward the Confessor]]), the exiled sons of [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]]. Isolated in Scandinavia, Harthacnut was unable to prevent Harold Harefoot seizing the crown for himself. Ruling England from 1035, Harold died in 1040 just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 48; see Idem pp. 28&ndash;53 for more general picture</ref> Arriving soon after Harold's death, Harthacnut reigned in England only two years before his own death in 1042, a death that led to the peaceful succession of Edward.<ref>Barlow,  ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 53</ref> Frank Barlow speculated on Siward's political stance, guessing that during these upheavals Siward assumed "a position of benevolent or prudent neutrality".<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 57</ref>

Siward is found in 1038, as ''Sywardus Comes'' ("Earl Siward"), witnessing a charter of King Harthacnut to the [[Abbey of Bury St Edmunds]].<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 995|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+995| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXIX (1 of 1)</ref> He witnessed a confirmation granted by Harthacnut to [[F<U+00E9>camp Abbey]], between 1040 and 1042, of an earlier grant made by Cnut.<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 982|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+982| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXIX (1 of 1)</ref> In 1042, he witnessed grants by Harthacnut to [[Abingdon Abbey]] and to [[<U+00C6>lfwine of Winchester|<U+00C6>lfwine]], [[Bishop of Winchester]].<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 993|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+993| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 994|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+994| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXIX (1 of 1)</ref>

Siward was, at some stage, married to <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d, daughter of [[Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh]], and granddaughter of [[Uhtred the Bold]].<ref name=Aird>Aird, "Siward"</ref> The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''' asserts that, in 1041 [[Eadulf III of Bernicia|Eadulf]], Earl of Bamburgh, was "betrayed" by King Harthacnut.<ref>ASC MSs [http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/c/c-L.html C], [http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/d/d-L.html D], s.a. 1041</ref> The "betrayal" seems to have been carried out by Siward; since when the ''[[Libellus de Exordio]]'' and other sources write about the same event, they say that  Siward attacked and killed Eadulf.<ref>Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de Exordio'', pp. 170<U+2013>71</ref> It was thus that Siward became earl of all Northumbria, perhaps the first person to do so since Uhtred the Bold. It is possible that Siward used <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d's lineage to claim the earldom of Bamburgh for himself, although it is unclear whether the marriage took place before or after Siward killed Eadulf.<ref>Morris, ''Marriage and Murder'', p. 14</ref> Kapelle has pointed out that no ruler of Bamburgh after Uhtred is attested at the English royal court, which he argued "must mean they were in revolt" against the monarchy, and that Siward's attack may therefore have been encouraged by a monarch wishing to crush a rebellious or disloyal vassal.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 24</ref> Siward however probably had his own interests too. Killing Eadulf eliminated his main rival in the north, and the marriage associated him with the family of Uhtred the Bold, and with Uhtred's surviving son [[Gospatric, son of Uhtred|Gospatric]].<ref name=Aird-53>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53</ref>  

There may nonetheless be a connection between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the ''Chronicle'' of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of [[Worcester]].<ref>Aird, "Siward"; Whitelock (ed.), ''English Historical Documents'', p. 318</ref> Harthacnut reigned only another year, dying on 8 June 1042.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 53</ref> He was succeeded by the exiled English [[<U+00E6>theling]] Edward. As an <U+00E6>theling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', pp. 48&ndash;49</ref> Edward was crowned king on [[Easter Day]], 3 April 1043.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 61</ref>

Relations between Siward and King Edward appear to have been good. Neither Siward nor any associates of Siward were punished by Edward in later years.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', pp. 76&ndash;77</ref> In fact, Siward appears to have been one of Edward's most powerful supporters. On 16&nbsp;November 1043, Siward, along with Earls Godwine of Wessex and [[Leofric of Mercia]], marched with King Edward against [[Emma of Normandy|Queen Emma]], helping the king to deprive the queen of her huge treasury.<ref>[http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/d/d-L.html ASC MS D], s.a. 1043; Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 76; Baxter, ''Earls of Mercia'', p. 39</ref> Edward then accused Emma of treason and deposed her son, [[Stigand]], [[List of the bishops of the Diocese of Norwich, England and its precursor offices|Bishop of Elmham]], from his position "because he was closest to his mother's counsel".<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', pp. 76&ndash;77, & n. 1 on p. 1, for the quote from the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', MS C</ref>

The Norman propagandist and historian, [[William of Poitiers]], claimed that Siward was among those who had sworn an oath to uphold Edward the Confessor's alleged declaration that [[William, Duke of Normandy]] (later King William I), was to be his heir.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 107, n. 1. The passage is quote in ''Ibid'', p. 222</ref> Others said to have made that oath were Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia, along with Stigand, who had been pardoned in 1044, and raised to [[Bishop of Winchester]] in 1047).<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 78</ref>  If this did happen, it was probably during or a little before spring 1051, when [[Robert of Jumi<U+00E8>ges|Robert]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was journeying to Rome for his [[pallium]].<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 107</ref> 

In 1051 Siward, along with Earls Leofric and [[Ralph the Timid]], mobilised forces in defence of the king against a rebellion by Earl Godwine and his sons.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 107; Mason, ''House of Godwin'', p. 63</ref> The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' relates that although Siward had to call up reinforcements, King Edward was successful and Earl Godwine was temporarily exiled.<ref>[http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/d/d-L.html ASC MS D], s.a. 1051; Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', pp. 107&ndash;14</ref> Earl Godwine remained a threat in exile, and the continued "belligerent support" of Siward and Leofric was thus vital to King Edward's safety.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 119</ref> It was apparently, however, the reluctance of these two earls to fight Earl Godwine that contributed to Godwine's re-establishment in England in 1052.<ref>Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 119; William, "Godwine"</ref>

There is evidence to suggest that Siward extended his power southward, bringing the [[Northamptonshire|shire of Northampton]] into his control in the 1040s and the [[shire of Huntingdon]] in the 1050s.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 595 (n. 1 from p. 594); Cain, "Introduction", p. 31; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 29</ref> The evidence comes from royal [[writ]]s addressed to Siward as earl in these shires.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 595</ref> Siward's predecessors as earl in these areas were other Scandinavians, Thuri and Bjorn son of Earl Ulf; the former was styled "earl of the Midlanders" (''comes mediterraneorum''), showing that this earldom represented the earlier polity of the [[Middle Angles]] of Mercia.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 595&ndash;96; Barlow, ''Edward the Confessor'', p. 89, n. 5; Williams, "'Cockles amongst the Wheat'", pp. 11, 20 n. 61</ref> It was this area, rather than Northumbria, to which Siward's descendants were most attached.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 596<U+2013>97</ref> 

Likewise, it has been argued that Siward brought [[Cumberland]], thought by some historians to have been lost to Strathclyde, back under Northumbrian lordship.<ref>Phythian-Adams, ''Land of the Cumbrians'', pp. 109, 148</ref> The evidence comes from a document known to historians as "Gospatric's Writ".<ref>Harmer (ed.), ''Anglo-Saxon Writs'', no. 121, pp. 419&ndash;23 ; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', pp. 42&ndash;43; Phythian-Adams, ''Land of the Cumbrians'', pp. 109, 148</ref> This is a written instruction, issued either by the future [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria]]<ref>Phythian-Adams, ''Land of the Cumbrians'', p. 181</ref> or Gospatric, son of Earl Uhtred<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 43</ref>) that was addressed to all Gospatric's kindred and to the notables dwelling in the "all the lands that were Cumbrian" (''on eallun <U+00FE>am landann <U+00FE>eo C<U+014D>mbres''); it ordered that one Thorfinn mac Thore be free in all things (''<U+00FE> Thorfynn mac Thore beo swa freo in eallan <U+00F0>ynges'') in [[Allerdale]], and that no man is to break the peace which was given by Gospatric and Earl Siward.<ref>Harmer (ed.), ''Anglo-Saxon Writs'', pp. 423&ndash;4</ref> Historians such as Charles Phythian-Adams believed that such phraseology indicated that Siward conquered the region from its previous rulers,<ref>Phythian-Adams, ''Land of the Cumbrians'', pp. 131&ndash;52;, 174&ndash;81 </ref> although others, like William Kapelle, believed that that the region had come, were it ever lost, back into English power before Siward's time.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', pp. 43&ndash;44; Phythian-Adams, ''Land of the Cumbrians'', pp. 131&ndash;52;, 174&ndash;81 </ref>

A little can be said about Siward's relations with the Northumbrian church, in particular with regard to his relations with [[Durham]]. As a result of Siward's marriage to <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d, Siward gained possession of a group of estates in [[Teesside]] claimed by the bishops of Durham.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53; Morris, ''Marriage and Murder'', pp. 4&ndash;5</ref> Acquisition of these estates might have brought opposition from the [[List of Bishops of Durham|Bishop of Durham]], but [[<U+00C6>thelric (Bishop of Durham)|<U+00C6>thelric]] the incumbent had been expelled by the clergy of Durham in either 1045 or 1046 and, according to the ''[[Libellus de Exordio]]'', only returned by bribing Siward.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', pp. 53&ndash;54; Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de Exordio'', p. 171</ref> According to the ''Libellus'', the clergy were "terrified and overwhelmed by the fearful power of the earl" and "were compelled willy nilly to be reconciled to the bishop, and to admit him into his episcopal see".<ref>Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de Exordio'', p. 171</ref> Despite this, Siward escaped censure in the writings of later Durham monks, something which suggests relations between Siward and Durham were probably good in general.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 54</ref>

Siward can be found witnessing numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls.<ref>For a survey, see Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXXIV (1 of 1)</ref> He witnessed at least seven, posibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049.<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 1001|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1001}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1006|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1006}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1005|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1005}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1004|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1004}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1003|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1003}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1002|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1002}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1044|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1044}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1391|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1391}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1011|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1011}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1010|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1010}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1012|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1012}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1007|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1007}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1008|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1008}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1009|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1009}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1014|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1014}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1015|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1015}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1055|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1055}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1017|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1017}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1019|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1019| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXXIV (1 of 1)</ref> A ''Dux'' ("earl") named Sihro<U+00FE> and Sihro<U+00F0> witnessed two charters in 1050, and this may be Siward.<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 1022|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1022}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1020|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1020| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXXIV (1 of 1)</ref> There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054.<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 1021|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1021}}; {{citation|title=Sawyer 1023|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1023| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXXIV (1 of 1)</ref> Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made<U+2014>probably at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]<U+2014>between [[Wulfwig]], [[Bishop of Dorchester (historic)|Bishop of Dorchester]], and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.<ref>{{citation|title=Sawyer 1478|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1478| publisher= Anglo-Saxons.net|accessdate=2009-03-13}}; Keynes, ''Atlas of Attestations'', Table LXXIV (1 of 1)</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" |"Around this time Siward, the mighty earl of Northumbria, almost a giant in stature, very strong mentally and physically, sent his son to conquer Scotland. When they came back and reported to his father than he had been killed in battle, he asked 'Did he receive his fatal wound in the front or the back of his body?' The messengers said 'In the front'. Then he said, 'That makes me very happy, for I consider no other death worthy for me or my son'. Then Siward set out for Scotland, and defeated the king in battle, destroyed the whole realm, and having destroyed it, subjected it to himself".<ref>Greenway, ''Henry of Huntingdon'', p. 21</ref>
|-

|}
Siward is perhaps most famous for his expedition in 1054 against [[Mac Bethad mac Findla<U+00ED>ch]] (known to the English of a later era as King Macbeth of Scotland), an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, [[Osbjorn Bulax|Osbjorn]]. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the ''Libellus de Exordio'', in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king [[Donnchad mac Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>in]] attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53; Rollason (ed.), ''Libellus de Exordio'', p. 169; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 254&ndash;55</ref> Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed killed Donnchad.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 255</ref> The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no connection between the two events is clear it is likely that they were linked.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 254&ndash;55</ref> 

The ''Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham'', written in the early 12th-century, relate under the year 1046 that "Earl Siward with a great army came to Scotland, and expelled king Mac Bethad, and appointed another; but after his departure Mac Bethad recovered his kingdom".<ref>Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 84</ref> Historian William Kapelle thought that this was a genuine event of the 1040s, related to the ''Annals of Tigernach'' entry for 1045 that reported a "battle between the Scots" which led to the death of [[Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n of Dunkeld]], Donnchad's father; Kapelle thought that Siward had tried to place Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n's son and Donnchad's brother Maldred on the Scottish throne.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 46</ref> Another historian, [[Alex Woolf]], argued that the ''Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham'' entry was probably referring to the invasion of Siward in 1054, but misplaced under 1046.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 259</ref>

During the invasion of 1054, a battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the [[Firth of Forth]], a battle known variously as the "Battle of the Seven Sleepers" or the "Battle of Dunsinane".<ref>Aitchison, ''Macbeth'', p. 90</ref> The tradition that the battle actually took place at [[Dunsinane]] has its origins in later medieval legend. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle is in the early 15th-century by [[Andrew of Wyntoun]].<ref>Aitchison, ''Macbeth'', p. 90; Duncan, ''Kingship'', pp. 35&ndash;36; see Aitchison, ''Macbeth'', pp. 172&ndash;73, for a discussion of the possibility that Dunsinane was the location</ref> 

The earliest contemporary English account of the battle is found in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', [[recension]] D: <blockquote>
{| 
| ''Her ferde Siward eolr mid miclum here on Scotland, <U+00E6>g<U+00F0>er ge mid scyphere 7 mid landfyrde, 7 feaht wi<U+00F0> Scottas, 7 aflymde <U+00FE>one kyng Macbeo<U+00F0>en, 7 ofsloh eall <U+00FE><U+00E6>t <U+00FE><U+00E6>r betst w<U+00E6>s on <U+00FE>am lande, 7 l<U+00E6>dde <U+00FE>onan micele herehu<U+00F0>e swilce nan man <U+00E6>r ne begeat,&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| At this time earl Siward went with a great army into Scotland, with both fleet and a land-force; and fought against the Scots, and put to flight the king Mac Bethad, and slew all that were best in the land, and brought thence much war-spoil, such as no man obtained before;&nbsp;&nbsp;

| And there were slain his son Osbjorn, and his sister's son Siward, and some of his [[housecarl]]s, and also of the king's, on the day of the [[Seven Sleepers]] (July 27).&nbsp;&nbsp;<ref>[http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/d/d-L.html ASC MS D], s.a. 1054; translation based on Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 86&ndash;87</ref>
|} </blockquote> John of Worcester, using a related version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', adds that Normans named Osbern Pentecost and Hugh, who had joined Mac Bethad earlier after fleeing from England, were killed in the battle.<ref>Darlington, McGurk and Bray (eds.), ''Chronicle of John of Worcester'', vol. ii, pp. 572 n. 2, 573, 574 n. 12, 575</ref>

The battle is mentioned in the Irish annals too, briefly in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and more extensively in the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'':<blockquote>
{| 
| ''Cath eter firu Alban & Saxanu i torchradur tri mile do Feraib Alban & mile co leth do Shaxanaib im Dolfinn m. Finntuir.&nbsp;&nbsp;''
| A battle [was fought] between the men of Scotland and the English; and in it fell three thousand of the men of Scotland, and one thousand five hundred of the English, including Dolfin, Finntur's son;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G100001A/text625.html Annals of Ulster, s. a. 1054]; translation based on Anderson, ''Early Sources'', vol. i, p. 593</ref>
|} </blockquote>

Dolfin is unidentified, but may have been a relation of Mac Bethad's enemy Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n of Dunkeld, on the basis that some of Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n's descendants may have borne this name.<ref>Aitchison, ''Macbeth'', p. 89; the relationship is dependent on the Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n, grandfather of [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria]] being the same as Cr<U+00ED>n<U+00E1>n of Dunkeld, something which is now in doubt; see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 249&ndash;52 and n. 39</ref>

The purpose of Siward's invasion is unclear, but it may be related to the identity of the "M<U+00E1>el Coluim" (Malcolm) mentioned in the sources. The early 12th-century chronicle attributed to John of Worcester, probably using an earlier source, wrote that Siward defeated Mac Bethad and made "M<U+00E1>el Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians" a king.<ref>Darlington et al., ''Chronicle'', vol. ii, pp. 574, 575; see also Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 261, n. 59</ref> The identity of M<U+00E1>el Coluim and the reasons for Siward's help are controversial. The traditional historical interpretation was that "M<U+00E1>el Coluim" is [[M<U+00E1>el Coluim mac Donnchada]], known sometimes today as Malcolm III or Malcolm Canmore, and that Siward was attempting to oust Mac Bethad in his favour.<ref>See, for instance, Ritchie, ''Normans'', p. 5, or Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 570</ref>

The traditional historical interpretation that "M<U+00E1>el Coluim" is M<U+00E1>el Coluim mac Donnchada derives from the ''Chronicle'' attributed to the 14th-century chronicler of Scotland, John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury.<ref>Broun, "Identity of the Kingdom", pp. 133&ndash;34; Duncan, ''Kingship'', p. 40</ref> The latter reported that Mac Bethad was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Mac Bethad outlived Siward by two years.<ref>Oram, ''David I'', p. 29</ref> [[A. A. M. Duncan]] argued in 2002 that, using the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified M<U+00E1>el Coluim "son of the king of the Cumbrians" with the later Scottish king of the same name.<ref>Duncan, ''Kingship'', pp. 37&ndash;41</ref> Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as [[Richard Oram]], [[Dauvit Broun]] and Alex Woolf.<ref>Broun, "Identity of the Kingdom", p. 134; Oram, ''David I'', pp. 18&ndash;20; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 262</ref> It has also been suggested that M<U+00E1>el Coluim may have been a son of the Strathclyde British king [[Owen the Bald]],<ref>Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 41</ref> perhaps by a daughter of [[M<U+00E1>el Coluim II]], King of Scotland.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 262</ref>

Duncan in fact believes that the Battle of the Seven Sleepers did not lead directly to a change of leadership in the Kingdom of Scotland.<ref>Duncan, ''Kingship'', p. 40</ref> It has been suggested that the chief consequence of Siward's expedition was not the overthrow of Mac Bethad, but the transfer of British territory<U+2014>perhaps previously lying under Scottish suzerainty<U+2014>to Northumbrian overlordship. Alex Woolf has posited that, in such a context, M<U+00E1>el Coluim might have been a discontented Cumbrian prince who had been forced to "put himself under English protection".<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 262&ndash;63</ref> Evidence for Northumbrian control of [[Strathclyde]] in this period includes 11th-century Northumbrian masonry found at the site of Glasgow Cathedral as well as early 12th-century claims from the [[archbishopric of York]] that Archbishop [[Cynesige]] (1051&ndash;1060) had consecrated two [[Bishops of Glasgow]].<ref>See Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 263; Johnson ''et al.'', ''Hugh the Chanter'', pp. 52, 53</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" |"Siward, the stalwart earl, being stricken by dysentery, felt that death was near, and said, "How shameful it is that I, who could not die in so many battles, should have been saved for the ignominious death of a cow! At least clothe me in my impenetrable breastplate, gird me with my sword, place my helmet on my head, my shield in my left hand, my gilded battle-axe in my right, that I, the bravest of soldiers, may die like a soldier." He spoke, and armed as he had requested, he gave up his spirit with honour".

|}
The 12th-century historian, Henry of Huntingdon, in his ''Historia Anglorum'', relates that when Siward was attacked by [[dysentery]], fearing to die "like a cow" and wishing rather to die like a soldier, he clothed himself in armour and took to hand an axe and shield. Ennobled in such a manner, Siward died.<ref name=Greenway-22/> This anecdote is of doubtful historicity, and is thought to be derived from the [[saga]] devoted to Earl Siward, now lost.<ref>Mason, ''House of Godwine'', pp. 88&ndash;89</ref> The ''Vita <U+00C6>dwardi Regis'' states that Siward died at York and was buried in "the monastery of St Olaf" at [[Galmanho]], a claim confirmed by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', John of Worcester,  and the ''[[Historia Regum]]''.<ref name=Galmanho>Barlow (ed.), ''Life of King Edward'', p. 49 (= ''Vita <U+00C6>dwardi'', i. 5), & note ''Ibid'', p. 48, n. 114; Darlington, McGurk and Bray (eds.), ''Chronicle of John of Worcester'', vol. ii, pp. 576, & n. 5; Stevenson, ''Simeon of Durham'', p. 124</ref> 

Material incorporated in two surviving sources is thought by some to attest to the existence of a lost saga or some other kind of literary tradition concerning Siward's life. The first source is the ''Vita et Passio Waldevi'', a hagiographic history of Siward's cult-inspiring son Waltheof. This text contains an account of Waltheof's [[Father|paternal]] origin, and in the process recounts certain adventures of his father Siward (see boxes throughout article). The second major witness of the tradition is Henry of Huntingdon's ''Historia Anglorum'', which contains extracts of saga-like material relating to Siward's invasion of Scotland (1054) and his death (1055).<ref>Wright, ''Cultivation of Saga'', pp. 75, 76, 127&ndash;33, 136</ref> The Anglo-Saxonist [[Frank Stenton]] declared that Siward was "not a statesman, but a Danish warrior of the primitive type".<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 417</ref> Writers in the half-century after his death remembered Siward as a strong ruler who brought peace and suppressed brigandage.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 54, and notes 163&ndash;63</ref>

Siward died more than a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by [[Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester]].<ref>See Williams & Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', pp. 744, 802&ndash;03; Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 28, 220</ref> This land was stated to have been worth <U+00A3>212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held <U+00A3>136 worth of land across 9 counties.<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 221&ndash;24</ref> Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth <U+00A3>348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the <U+00A3>2493 in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia.<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 206&ndash;20</ref> Of the latter, however, [[Morcar of Northumbria|Morcar of Mercia]], Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth <U+00A3>968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth <U+00A3>491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria.<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'',  pp. 191&ndash;94, 205, 215&ndash;17, 220</ref> Moreover, the counties that would become [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Northumberland]], [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the [[Harrying of the North]].<ref>Green, ''Aristocracy'', pp. 100&ndash;10; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', pp. 158&ndash;90</ref>  

Siward is said to have built a church dedicated to St Olaf at Galmanho, York.<ref name=Galmanho/> The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England.<ref>Daniell, ''Death and Burial in Medieval England'', p. 186</ref> [[Siward's Howe]], ''i.e.'', Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.<ref>Baxter, ''Earls of Mercia'', p. 103</ref> One of Siward's sons is known to have survived him, Waltheof, whose mother was <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d. Waltheof later rose to be an earl in the [[East Midlands]] before becoming Earl of Northumbria.<ref name=Lewis-Waltheof>Lewis, "Waltheof"</ref> When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror, however, the act led to his execution and to his subsequent veneration as a [[saint]] at [[Crowland Abbey]].<ref>Lewis, "Waltheof"; Scott, "Earl Waltheof", pp. 206&ndash;07; Watkins, "Cult of Earl Waltheof", pp. 95&ndash;101</ref> Waltheof's daughter married [[David I, King of the Scots]], and through this connection Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs.<ref name=Lewis-Waltheof/> Besides <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d, Siward is known to have been married to a woman named Godgifu, who died before Siward. The marriage is known from a grant she made of territory around [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], to [[Peterborough Abbey]].<ref name=Aird/> Although no surviving children are attested, and no source states the name of Osbjorn's mother, this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers, and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn to inherit his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d.<ref>Aird, ''St Cuthbert'', p. 53, n. 160; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 31</ref>
