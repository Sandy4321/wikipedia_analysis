Prior to that position he was the head coach of the [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] baseball team from 1995<U+2013>2006, the [[United States Air Force Academy]] baseball team from 1989<U+2013>1994 and the [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] baseball team from 1983<U+2013>1988.  Mainieri coached LSU to the [[2009 College World Series]] championship.

==Playing career==
Mainieri graduated from [[Christopher Columbus High School (Miami, Florida)|Christopher Columbus High School]] in Miami, Florida.  He started his college baseball playing career in 1976 at LSU.  He played for one season, earning a [[Letterman (sports)|letter]], before transferring to Miami-Dade North Community College to play for his father, Demie Mainieri.  After one year he transferred to the [[University of New Orleans]] where he played for two years and helped the team win two [[Sun Belt Conference]] titles and earn an appearance in the [[1979 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]].

Mainieri completed his undergraduate degree requirement at [[Florida International University]] in 1980, earning a B.S. in [[physical education]].  He played two years of [[minor league baseball]] and earned a M.S. in [[sports administration]] from [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] in 1982.

==Coaching career==
===St. Thomas===
Mainieri began his coaching career in Florida as the head coach of [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] in 1983. In six seasons, his team went 179<U+2013>121<U+2013>1, and Mainieri became the winningest coach in St. Thomas History.

==== Induction into the Hall of Fame ====
It was announced that Mainieri will be inducted into the St. Thomas Hall of Fame on November 1, 2009.  Mainnieri becomes just the fourth person to be inducted into the St. Thomas Hall of Fame joining Ken Stibler, Marinka Bisceglia and John Batule.<ref>[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=204818461 Mainieri Elected to St. Thomas Hall of Fame]</ref>

===Air Force===
He moved on to the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1989, where he would also remain for six seasons. He became the second-winningest coach in Air Force history posting a mark of 152<U+2013>158.

===Notre Dame===
Moving to the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in 1995, Mainieri turned the Fighting Irish into a perennial postseason contender winning the [[Big East]] tournament an unprecedented 5 straight seasons, making the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] 9 out of 12 seasons, and leading the Irish to one College World Series appearance in 2002. In total, Mainieri posted a .714 winning percentage going 533<U+2013>213<U+2013>3 in twelve seasons.

===LSU===
Mainieri replaced [[Smoke Laval]] at the end of the [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU Tigers]]' 2006 season. In the 2007 season, LSU finished 29<U+2013>26<U+2013>1 and did not reach the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. 

40 games into the 2008 season, the Tigers were again struggling with a 23<U+2013>16<U+2013>1 record. However, the team then went on a [[Southeastern Conference]] record 23-game win streak and moved on to claim the 2008 SEC Tournament Championship. Under Mainieri's leadership, the team swept the Baton Rouge Regional bracket of the NCAA baseball post-season and won their first Super-Regional in years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestate.com/sports/story/422830.html |title=Baseball: LSU's confidence grows with win streak |accessdate=June 18, 2008 | date=June 3, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[UC Irvine]] ended the streak in the first game of the Super Regional, defeating LSU 11<U+2013>5, but LSU won the next two games and reached the [[2008 College World Series]]. It was LSU's first College World Series appearance since 2004 and they recorded their first win since their [[2000 College World Series|CWS championship]] in 2000. 

Mainieri's Tigers entered the 2009 season as the favorites to win the SEC, and were the preseason No. 1 team in some national polls.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=27865&SPID=2173&DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=3671698 | title=SEC Coaches Pick Baseball to Win League | accessdate=2009-06<U+2014>26 | date=June 26, 2009}}</ref> During the season, the Tigers won the SEC regular season title, the 2009 SEC Tournament Championship, and reached the  [[2009 College World Series]] as the No. 3 national seed. Mainieri then led LSU to the CWS Finals against [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas]]. The Tigers won the first game 7<U+2013>6 in 11 innings, lost the second 5<U+2013>1, but won the national championship defeating the Longhorns 11<U+2013>4 in the final game. The Tigers finished the season with a 56<U+2013>17 record.  Mainieri received the 2009 Coach of the Year award from [[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper]] and the 2009 Coach of the Year award by [[Baseball America]]. [[Rivals.com]] also named Mainieri the 2009 National Coach of the Year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsureveille.com/baseball-collegiate-baseball-names-mainieri-2009-coach-of-the-year-1-37-p-m-1.1770015 | title=Collegiate Baseball names Mainieri 2009 Coach of the Year | accessdate=2009-06<U+2014>26 | date=June 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=3757775&DB_OEM_ID=5200 | title=Mainieri named 'Baseball America' Coach of the Year | accessdate=2009-06<U+2014>30 | date=June 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsusports.net//ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=3760912 | title=Mainieri Named National Coach of the Year by Rivals | accessdate=July 6, 2009 | date=July 6, 2009}}</ref>
