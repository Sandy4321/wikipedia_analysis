'''Dave Davies''' (born '''David Russell Gordon Davies''', 3 February 1947, [[Fortis Green]], [[London]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[rock music|rock]] musician ([[singer]] and lead [[guitarist]]), most well known for his membership with the [[England|English]] rock [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[The Kinks]].

In 2003, Davies was ranked 88th in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 greatest guitarists of all time|100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time/42|title=Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time}}</ref>

==The Kinks==
{{main|The Kinks}}
He founded The Kinks with [[Pete Quaife]] in 1963. His brother [[Ray Davies|Ray]], who became the best-known member of the band, joined soon after. The quartet was formed when [[drummer]] [[Mick Avory]] joined. Davies had a turbulent relationship with Avory, one of the reasons behind the latter's departure from the band in the mid 1980s, although the two had been roommates in the mid 1960s.

The group  disbanded in 1996, but Davies continued to have a steady musical career as a [[musician|performer]] and [[songwriter]] until a [[hypertension]]-induced [[stroke]] in 2004 sidelined him.

Although never attaining the fame and reputation of his older brother, who wrote and sang lead on most of the Kinks' songs, Dave Davies wrote some [[chart-topper|hit]]s himself. These include "[[Death of a Clown]]", "[[Love Me Till The Sun Shines]]", "[[Susannah's Still Alive]]", and "Living on a Thin Line". He is also known for his innovative way of creating the buzzing tone for the [[power chord]]s heard in the hit single "[[You Really Got Me]]" from 1964.

The Kinks were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in November 2005. The four original members were there to receive the award.

==Solo work==
{{main|A Hole in the Sock of (Dave Davies)}}
In July 1967, Davies released his first [[solo (music)|solo]] [[single (music)|single]], credited entirely under his name, (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies) entitled "[[Death of a Clown]]".<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_clown Wikipedia entry for Death of a Clown]</ref> In the past as a member of The Kinks Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and as part of [[album]]s. The Kinks' [[record label]] sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued "Death of a Clown" as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was The Kinks. 

Upon release, "Death of a Clown" rose to #2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Wanting to profit off of the new buzz that was suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was scheduled for release some time in 1968 or 1969.<ref name="Kindakinks">[http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showrelease.php?release=376 Kindakinks.net liner notes for T.A.T.N.W.]</ref>

The follow-up single, "[[Susannah's Still Alive]]", was released in November 1967.<ref>[http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php?song=383 Kindakinks.net]</ref> However, it only reached #20 on the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' [[record chart|chart]].<ref>[http://www.kindakinks.net/charts.html Chart Positions]</ref> The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fair. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, fans nicknamed it ''A Hole in the Sock Of''.<ref name ="Kindakinks"/>

"Lincoln County" was chosen as the next single, but failed to chart. By the time one or two more singles were met with the same results, a combination of Davies' own disinterest in continuing and Pye's decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=sekDAAAACAAJ&dq Google Books listing for Kink]</ref>

Davies would make several attempts at solo albums throughout the '70s, but he never felt enough enthusiasm or interest to see the projects through. He would often be the main producer and engineer at The Kinks' main studio, [[Konk (recording)|Konk]]. He produced albums for the likes of [[Claire Hamill]] and Andy Desmond.<ref>[http://time-has-told-me.blogspot.com/2007_01_01_archive.html A blog with details on the track listing and release of this Andy Desmond album.] The entry is a few paragraphs down.</ref> Ray Davies would comment on his brother's studio and solo work in a November 1975 interview:

{{cquote|My brother is all right, his life is dedicated to getting the (Konk) studio together. He's really into that. He's started recording, but I might even have to get a contract with him and say he's got to deliver (a solo) album. It may be the only way he's going to record is at gunpoint.}}

After the aborted solo effort, Davies' solo career was not revived until 1980, with the release of ''Dave Davies (AFL1-3603)'', which peaked at #42 on the [[Billboard 200]]. He went on to release ''Glamour'' (1981), which charted at #152. ''Chosen People'' was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.

Davies released his first true solo studio album in twenty years, ''[[Bug (Dave Davies album)|Bug]]'', in 2002.

In January 2007 Davies released ''Fractured Mindz'', his first album of all new material in nearly five years. It was also his first new studio effort since his stroke in the summer of 2004 besides the track "God In my Brain" (which was recorded and released on the compilation album ''Kinked'' in January 2006).

In February 2010, Davies releases a DVD, ''Mystical Journey'', and will be touring in support of the release.

==Stroke and personal life==
On 30 June 2004, Davies suffered a [[stroke]] in a lift at [[Broadcasting House]], where he had been promoting his then current album, ''[[Bug (Dave Davies album)|Bug]]''. He was released from the hospital on 27 August.  By 2006, Davies had recovered enough to be able to walk, talk and play guitar; he will be touring in 2010 .

He is friends with [[horror film|horror]] director [[John Carpenter]]; his work is featured on Carpenter's remake of ''[[Village of the Damned (1995 film)|Village of the Damned]]''. Carpenter also acted as godfather to Davies' son, Daniel. Daniel is the singer and guitarist in the hard rock band [[Year Long Disaster]].

Davies is openly [[bisexual]].<ref>[http://www.davedavies.com/articles/mojo_0596.htm Davedavies.com]</ref>
