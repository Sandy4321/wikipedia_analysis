The '''Sarus Crane''', '''''Grus antigone''''' is a large non-migratory [[Crane (bird)|crane]] that is found in parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Australia]]. Standing at a height of up to 1.8 m,<ref name=wood/> the tallest flying birds, they are conspicuous and iconic<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vyas, Rakesh|title=Status of Sarus Crane ''Grus antigone antigone'' in Rajasthan and its ecological requirements|journal=Zoos' Print Journal|volume=17|year=2002|issue=2|pages=691<U+2013>695|url=http://www.zoosprint.org/ZooPrintJournal/2002/February/691-695.pdf}}</ref> species of open wetlands. Their numbers have declined greatly in the last century and it has been estimated that the current population is just a tenth or less (just 2.5%) of the numbers that existed in the 1850s. The stronghold of the species is India, where it is traditionally revered and lives in agricultural lands in close proximity to humans. Elsewhere, the species has been extirpated in many parts of its former range.

== Description ==
[[Image:Sarus Crane I IMG 8628.jpg|thumb|left| at  [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]], [[Rajasthan]], [[India]].]]
Adults birds are very large with grey wings and body; a bare red head and part of the upper neck; a whitish crown; and a long dark pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, unlike a [[heron]] that folds it back, and the black wing tips can be seen; their long red or pink legs trail behind them. They have a grey ear covert patch, a reddish iris and a greenish grey bill. Juveniles have a pinkish base to the bill and the head is fully feathered and grey.<ref name=pcr/> The bare head and neck has red skin that is brighter during the breeding season. The skin is rough and covered by papillae and a narrow area around behind the head is covered by black bristly feathers. The sexes do not differ in colour although males are larger on average than females; Indian males can attain a maximum height of approximately 200 cm (6.6 ft), with a wingspan of 250 cm (8.5 ft), making them the world's tallest living flying bird. The average weight of nominate race individuals is 6.8-7.8 kg, while five adult ''sharpii'' averaged 8.4 kg.<ref name=johnsgard/> Across the range, weight can vary from 5 to 12 kg (11-26 lbs), height typically from 115 to 167 cm (45-69 in) and the wingspan from 220 to 280 cm (87-110 in). Birds from Australia tend to be smaller than birds from the north.

In [[Australia]], the Sarus can easily be mistaken for the more widespread [[Brolga]]. The Brolga has the red colouring is confined to the head and not extending into the neck.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species has historically been widely distributed on the plains of India along the Gangetic plains and extending south until the Godavari River. The range in Southeast Asia include Thailand, Burma and further east into the Philippines. In Australia they are found only in the northern parts. The worldwide range has reduced and the largest area is in India. With marshland largely destroyed these cranes are increasingly dependent on wet paddy fields in India. Although found only at a low elevation on the plains, there are some historic records from highland marshes from much further north in Harkit Sar and Kahag in Kashmir.<ref>{{cite book|title=Travels in Kashmir, Ladak, Iskardo. Vol. 2|author=Vigne, GT|year=1842|publisher=Henry Colburn,London|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/travelsinkashmir02vign#page/18/mode/2up}}</ref>

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This species was originally described by [[Linnaeus]] under the genus ''Ardea'' along with the larger herons. 

This species has several subspecies some of which are no longer recognized while some are believed to be extinct. The nominate race from India is the largest and in the east from Myanmar it is replaced by race ''sharpii'' extending into the Southeast Asian islands. The [[Type (zoology)|nominate]] form from the [[Indian subcontinent]] is well marked and differentiated by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary [[remiges]]. The race in Australia, initially placed in ''sharpii'' (also sometimes spelt ''sharpei'' but amended to conform to the rules Latin grammar<ref name=pcr>Rasmussen, PC & JC Anderton (2005) Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Smithsonian Institution and Lynx Edicions. Vol. 2. p. 138-139</ref>) has been separated and named as the race ''gilliae'' (sometimes spelt ''gillae'' or even ''gilli''). The Australian race was designated in 1988 (the species itself was discovered in Australia only in 1969 and was initially considered to be a recent ''immigrant'', however native Australians differentiate between the Sarus and the Brolga. Natives call the Sarus "the crane that dips its head in blood".<ref group=note>Meine & Archibald (1996) p. 126</ref>) by Schodde on the basis of its distinctively darker plumage and large grey patch of ear coverts. This race is also the most recently diverged one with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia.<ref name=wood/> An additional subspecies ''luzonica'' has been suggested for the race that was found in the Philippines and now extinct. It may be synonymous with either ''gilliae'' or ''sharpii''.<ref name=meine>{{cite book|year=1996|title=The cranes: Status survey and conservation action plan|publisher=IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=2831703263|author=Meine, Curt D. and George W.

Whether these forms are all well-established subspecies is somewhat disputed. Thorough [[mtDNA]] analyses, although hampered by the small number of available specimens, suggest that the continental Asian populations had ongoing [[gene flow]] until the 20th century range reductions, and that Australia was colonized by this species only in the [[Late Pleistocene]], some 35.000 years ago.<ref name=wood>{{cite journal|year=1996|title= Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation among the subspecies of Sarus Crane (''Grus antigone'')|journal=The Auk|volume=113|issue=3|pages=655<U+2013>663|url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v113n03/p0655-p0663.pdf|format=PDF|author=Wood, T.C. & Krajewsky, C.}}</ref> This has been corroborated by [[nDNA]] [[microsatellite]] analyses with 4 times the [[sample size]].<ref name=jones>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Kenneth L.|coauthors=Barzen, Jeb A. & Ashley, Mary V.|year=2005|title= Geographical partitioning of microsatellite variation in the sarus crane|journal=Animal Conservation| volume=8|issue=1|pages=1<U+2013>8|doi=10.1017/S1367943004001842}}</ref> This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with the genetically quite distinct Brolga, the Australian Sarus Crane can be expected to be an incipient species and that the three major surviving populations should be considered as "[[Evolutionary Significant Unit]]s".
===Etymology===
The common name of ''sarus'' is from the Hindi name (s<U+0101>ras) for the crane. The Hindi word is derived from the Sanskrit word ''sarasa'' for the "lake bird", (sometimes corrupted to  ''s<U+0101>rhans''). While Indians held the species in veneration, British soldiers in colonial India hunted the bird calling it the ''serious''<ref>{{cite book|author=Yule, Henry, Sir. |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Unlike many cranes which make long [[bird migration|migration]]s, the Sarus Crane does not; they may however make short-distance dispersal movements in response to rain or dry weather conditions. They tend to be more gregarious in the non-breeding season. A study in the 29 km<sup>2</sup> [[Keoladeo National Park]] noted as many as 300 birds during summer and only about 30 resident during the breeding season.<ref name=bharatpur/>

They roost in shallow water, where they may be safe from some ground predators.<ref name=johnsgard/> Adult birds do not moult their feather annually with feathers being replaced only once in two or three years.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hartert, Ernst & F Young|year=1928|title=Some observations on a pair of Sarus Cranes at Tring|journal=Novitates Zoologicae |volume=34|pages=75-76|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/novitateszoologi34lond#page/74/mode/2up}}</ref>
===Feeding===
These birds are usually seen in pairs or small groups of 2-5 and they forage in shallow water (usually with less than 1 foot depth of water) or in fields, sometimes probing in mud with their long bills. Larger flocks of up to 200 are sometimes noted<ref>{{cite journal|author=Livesey,TR |year=1937|title=  Sarus flocks.|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume= 39|issue=2|pages= 420<U+2013>421}}</ref> especially in some parts of the range such as in Gujarat<ref>{{cite journal|author=Acharya,Hari Narayan G|year=1936|title= Sarus flocks.|journal= J.

Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume=34|issue=2|pages=582<U+2013>583}}</ref>), frogs, crustaceans and seeds. Plants include tubers, corms of aquatic plants, grass shoots. They may also feed on cultivated crops such as groundnuts and cereal crops such as rice.<ref name=johnsgard/> They may also tackle vertebrate prey such as watersnakes (''[[Xenochrophis piscator]]'').<ref name=johnsgard/> They have been known to take the eggs of other birds.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gopi Sundar,KS |year=2000|title=  Eggs in the diet of the Sarus Crane ''Grus antigone'' (Linn.).|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. |volume= 97|issue=3|pages=428<U+2013>429}}</ref>
===Courtship and breeding===
Sarus Cranes are known for their loud trumpeting calls. The loud trumpeting calls are like in other cranes possible by the elongated trachea that form coils within the sternal region.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fitch, WT|year=1999|title=Acoustic exaggeration of size in birds via tracheal elongation:

These include "dancing" movements that are performed both during and outside the breeding season and involve a short series of jumping and bowing or going in circles.

As a species, the Sarus crane is classified as '''Vulnerable (A2cde + 3cde)'''. This means that the global population has declined by about a third since 1980, and is expected to continue to do so until the late 2010s. Threats constitute habitat destruction and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species. Inbreeding effects should be monitored in the Australian population.<ref name=jones/>
