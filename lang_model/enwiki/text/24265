'''''We Don't Need to Whisper''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Angels & Airwaves]]. Recorded at Neverpants Ranch in [[San Diego]], [[California]] and produced by guitarist/vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]], the album was released on May 23, 2006 through [[Geffen Records]]. DeLonge had previously exited his former band, [[Blink-182]], in February 2005 after months of heated exchanges and increasing tension within the trio. DeLonge desired to spend more time with his family, and following the band's break-up, spent three weeks in complete isolation, contemplating his life, career, and future in music.

Equally inspired by personal crises and global events, ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' came together over the following seasons as DeLonge taught himself instruments and created his own home studio. He recruited his longtime friend [[David Kennedy]], with whom he had worked with on the [[Box Car Racer]] project, for guitar, as well as [[Atom Willard]] and [[Ryan Sinn]] on drums and bass, respectively. The quintet were primarily inspired by [[arena rock]] groups such as [[U2]] and [[The Police]]. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music<U+2014>calling it "the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation"<U+2014>prompted media interest but also concern from friends and family.<ref name="jcpose"/>

The record peaked at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has sold nearly 800,000 copies since. Four singles were released, three of which would chart within the top 20 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with "[[The Adventure]]" peaking at number five. ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' received largely mixed reviews from music critics: while many celebrated the album's obvious musical influences, several found its contents rather pretentious. A documentary film based on the recording process of the record, as well the genesis of the band, ''[[Start the Machine (film)|Start the Machine]]'', was released in 2008.

By 2004, Blink-182, consisting of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] and drummer [[Travis Barker]], had emerged as the biggest [[pop punk]] act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and number one album ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001).<ref name=Kerrang05>{{cite journal| last =Browne | first =Nichola | date = November 20, 2005| title = Punk Rock!

The album, recorded with the help of [[Hazen Street]] guitarist and longtime friend [[David Kennedy]], was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed.<ref name="TomQA2005"/> The moody subject matter and music on ''Box Car Racer'' edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored [[experimental music|experimentalist]] elements on their next effort, an [[Blink-182 (album)|eponymous fifth studio album]] (2003).<ref name="totalguitar"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/other_stories/documents/02276402.htm |title=Blink 183: Box Car Racer go for a spin |author=Sean Richardson|date=May 23, 2002 |publisher=''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref><ref name="tonedown">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476576/20030811/blink_182.jhtml |title=Blink-182 Tone Down Pranks, Get Down to Real <U+2018>Action<U+2019> on Next LP |author=Jon Wiederhorn|date=August 11, 2003|publisher=MTV News |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref> [[Geffen Records]], after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band.

==Recording and production==
After recording several demos in his home studio, DeLonge embarked on a mission to assemble his band. Following the band's break-up, DeLonge received calls from musicians of higher profiles offering to collaborate on music, but declined them.<ref name=billboardarticle>{{cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58780/delonge-gets-serious-with-angels-airwaves| date =April 12, 2006| title =DeLonge Gets Serious with Angels & Airwaves| journal =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| accessdate =June 7, 2013}}</ref> Instead, DeLonge recruited longtime friend and Box Car Racer guitarist David Kennedy. [[Atom Willard]] and [[Ryan Sinn]] soon followed, but the latter dropped out.  Sinn was reluctant to join another band so soon after the collapse of his previous group, [[The Distillers]].<ref name="altpressint"/> Kennedy found him in a similar situation with his band Hazen Street, and found the new environment refreshing.<ref name="altpressint"/> While uncertain on joining the band, DeLonge offered Sinn a job working at [[Macbeth Footwear]]'s warehouse, where he worked until he committed to the band full-time that August.<ref name="altpressint"/> The band members put forth several sayings and rules, which included "Friends and family first; band second."<ref name="altpressint"/>

The record was inspired by a mix of both personal developments and global events. During production, DeLonge studied [[World War II]], which he considered the "last great war clearly a battle between good and evil."<ref name="rocksound"/> Following the war, he saw [[United States in the 1950s|America entered a period of prosperity]], and he felt it an analogy for what could be possible in his life.<ref name=rocksound>{{cite journal| author= | date = January 2006| title =Angels & Airwaves on Cloud Nine| journal = [[Rock Sound]]| volume = | issue = | page = 7| accessdate =June 7, 2013}}</ref> The album was inspired by other personal crises as well, such as DeLonge's father's diagnosis of [[leukemia]] and his brother's deployment to [[Iraq War|Iraq]], which DeLonge felt was "a war where people didn't need to go in the first place."<ref name="billboardarticle"/><ref name=icons>{{cite journal| author=Tom Bryant | date = February 2006| title =Icons: The Rock Stars That Changed Your World: Tom DeLonge| journal = [[Kerrang!]]| volume = | issue = | page = 40| publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]]| location =[[London]] | issn =0262-6624| url = | accessdate =June 7, 2013}}</ref> While the band considered the project lightly [[progressive rock|progressive]], the album lacks guitar solos the genre is commonly known for in place of melodies inspired by 1970s rock bands, such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="rocksound"/> DeLonge found himself listening to [[Peter Gabriel]], [[U2]], [[The Police]] and [[The Cure]] for influence, which were all bands that achieved [[arena rock|stadium-level success]] and inspired DeLonge's desire to reach the widest audience possible.<ref name="qandaRS"/>

==Composition==
[[File:Roxanne Police.jpg|thumb|The record was inspired by [[arena rock]] and bands such as [[The Police]], pictured above.]]
The overlying message the band intended for each song is that "tomorrow could be the best day of [your] life."<ref name="change"/> Track one, "Valkyrie Missile", opens the record with a cinematic organ melody, 1980s-recalling guitars and the sound of an astronaut's voice asking, "Anybody out there?"<ref name="change"/> "Distraction" follows and is peppered with hand claps and a keyboard melody over verses lamenting death and destruction.<ref name="change"/> "Do It for Me Now" originated from a beat DeLonge created in 2004 for rapper [[Talib Kweli]], who turned it down.<ref name="change"/> The [[Morse code]] beat was later adapted by the band and inspired DeLonge's vision of the song being the soundtrack to young lovers watching the sunrise.<ref name="change"/> "The Adventure" is an "exhilarating ode to a beckoning future with a huge guitar sound reminiscent of [[The Cure]]."<ref name="change"/> "A Little's Enough" was inspired by an idea relative to religion, in which a God came to "fix everything" on the planet, whether it be terrorism, war or famine.<ref name="change"/>

"The War" is an anthem that was inspired by the [[Iraq War]] and the amount of casualties caused in battle.<ref name="change"/> "It Hurts" was inspired by a friend whose wife committed adultery and was manipulating him.<ref name="change"/> The situation touched DeLonge deeply enough that he spent a night up crying for him, in which he wrote the track.<ref name="qandaRS"/> During recording, DeLonge would often take his daughter, Ava, to an ice cream shop in [[San Diego]]. On one occasion, the father and daughter wandered into a next door toy store and DeLonge was enchanted by the sound of a pink toy piano, which he would eventually purchase.<ref name="change"/> DeLonge placed the piano in his shower and recorded the results, which became "Start the Machine". The track attempts to paint a picture of "being on a boat as you're leaving a city in flames," only to find a tropical island and a much more beautiful place ahead. DeLonge considered it a reference to his past with Blink-182 and central to the theme that the band strove for - that "something special [can come] out of destruction."<ref name="change"/>

We knew that we were the only band that could do something like that."<ref name="TomQA2005"/> The other band members did not refute DeLonge's press statements, viewing them as tongue-in-cheek and offering little substance.<ref name="altpressint"/>

Utterly consumed by the band, DeLonge often obsessed over minor details and beamed with ideas for accompanying films and short films. By the end of the recording process and shortly after his press statements, his management came to DeLonge and had an "intervention" in which they pressed him on his frame of mind.<ref name="jcpose"/> In reality, DeLonge was addicted to [[Vicodin]] due to his back problem, which fueled his ambitious beliefs.<ref name="chicago">{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0426-luis-20100426,0,1265805.story?page=1 | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Tom DeLonge glad he's back with Blink | first=Luis | last=Arroyave | date=April 26, 2010}}</ref> He quit Vicodin cold turkey when he was unable to get it for a week, hallucinating and deep in withdrawal.<ref name="upsdowns">{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Andy |title=Inside the Ups and Downs of Blink-182|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |date=September 30, 2011 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-interviews-inside-the-ups-and-downs-of-blink-182-20110930?page=2|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

''We Don't Need to Whisper'' received largely mixed reviews from contemporary music critics at the time of its release. ''[[Alternative Press]]'' was generally the most effusive of the positive reviews, calling Angels & Airwaves' debut "everything a rock band should be in 2006." The publication found the 10 tracks nothing too heavy or thought-provoking, writing, "While the lyrics might be DeLonge at his most soul-searching, the music is built for nothing smaller than football stadiums."<ref name=altpressreview>{{cite journal| last =| first =| date =July 2006| title =''We Don't Need to Whisper'' - Review| journal = [[Alternative Press]]| volume = | issue = | page =202 | publisher = Alternative Press Magazine, Inc.| location =[[Cleveland, Ohio]] | issn =1065-1667 | url = http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/wedontneedtowhisper| accessdate = }}</ref> [[IGN]] was also very positive in their assumptions of the record, writing, "This album is like a post-millennial concept record that beckons to be listened to with the lights dimmed and the headphones clamped tightly around your aural receptors.

Continued, reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that "It may not make for a successful record, but it does make for an interesting one, particularly in how DeLonge's desire to be taken seriously has led him to use the serious music of his adolescence as a signifier that he's serious now, but ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' is too doggedly dour and amorphous to be more than a curiosity."<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-dont-need-to-whisper-mw0000408915|title=''We Don't Need to Whisper'' - Review|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}</ref>
