Dr. '''Claes G<U+00F6>sta Ryn''' (born 12 June 1943) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born, [[United States|American]] academic and educator.<ref>[http://politics.cua.edu/Information/Ryn/CV/cv.cfm ''Claes G. Ryn'' (The Catholic University of America)]</ref>

==Background==
Ryn was born and raised in [[Norrk<U+00F6>ping]] in [[Sweden]]. He attended the Latin Gymnasium, Norrk<U+00F6>pings H<U+00F6>gre Allm<U+00E4>nna L<U+00E4>roverk' (1959<U+2013>63). He was an undergraduate and a doctoral student at [[Uppsala University]]. He did further doctoral study at [[Louisiana State University]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[United States]], (Ph.D. 1974). He has taught at the [[University of Virginia]] and at [[Georgetown University]].

==Career==
He is presently a professor of politics at [[Catholic University of America]] (CUA), where he was also chairperson of his department.  He is chairperson of the [[National Humanities Institute]] and editor of the academic journal ''[[Humanitas (journal)|Humanitas]]''. He is president of the [[Academy of Philosophy and Letters]]. He is a past president of the [[Philadelphia Society]] (2001 to 2002).<ref>http://phillysoc.org/presiden.htm</ref>

Ryn's fields of teaching and research include ethics and politics; epistemology; historicism; politics and culture; the history of Western political thought; conservatism; the theory of constitutionalism and democracy; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Irving Babbitt]]; [[Benedetto Croce]].<ref>[http://www.nhinet.org/ibdchina.htm ''Babbitt Makes Comeback in Communist China'' (National Humanities Institute)]</ref>

He has written much on ethics and politics and on the central role of culture, specifically, the imagination, in shaping politics and society. He has sought to reconstitute the epistemology of the humanities and social sciences, paying close attention to the interaction of will, imagination and reason. He has criticized abstract, ahistorical conceptions of rationality as inadequate to the study of distinctively human life and to the study of real universality. He has argued that there is a much different, experientially grounded form of rationality, the reason of philosophy proper, that is capable of at once humble and penetrating observation. He has developed a philosophy known as [[value-centered historicism]], which demonstrates the potential union of universality and historical particularity. In political theory he has been a sharp critic of [[Leo Strauss|Straussian]] anti-historical thinking and so-called [[neoconservatism]]. He has argued that in essential ways neoconservatism resembles the ideology of the  French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and is neo-Jacobin.<ref>[http://members.cox.net/wcampbell14/rynchicago.htm ''Which American?'' (Claes G. Ryn)]</ref><ref>[http://www.nhumanities.org/failed.htm ''How Conservatives Failed The Culture'' (Claes G. Ryn)]</ref><ref>[http://pluralist.press.illinois.edu/3.2/ryn.html ''Personalism and Value-Centered Historicism''( Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois)]</ref>

Ryn's discussion of democracy emphasizes that popular government can assume radically different forms, only some of which can be judged compatible with a higher, ethical striving. Theories of what he calls plebiscitary democracy assume romantic and utopian notions of human nature and society. Constitutional democracy is based on a more realistic view of man and is more consonant with the actual moral terms of human existence. This form of government has demanding moral and cultural preconditions and is endangered wherever those preconditions are not satisfied.   

In 2000 he gave the Distinguished Foreign Scholar Lectures at [[Beijing University]], which also published this lecture series in Chinese translation as a book, ''Unity Through Diversity'' (2001). He has lectured and published widely in [[China]]. In 2007 he gave a keynote address at the Chinese Academy of Social Science in Beijing. The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] edition (2007) of his book ''America the Virtuous'' became one of the most hotly discussed in China. ''Dushu,'' China's preeminent intellectual magazine, described it as "the kind of classical work that will be read over the generations."
