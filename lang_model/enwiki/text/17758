The game was originally released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in Japan, but has been ported by [[TOSE]] to the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]], [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]], with increasing changes. The game was re-titled "''Final Fantasy II''" during its initial release outside of Japan as the original ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'' and [[Final Fantasy III|''III'']] had not been released outside of Japan at the time, but later localizations used the original title.

The game's story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies, several of whom die or appear to die throughout the game. ''Final Fantasy IV'' introduced innovations that became staples of the ''Final Fantasy'' series and role-playing games in general. Its "Active Time Battle" system was used in six subsequent ''Final Fantasy'' games, and unlike prior games in the series gave each character their own unchangeable [[Final Fantasy character classes|character class]].

With its character-driven plot, use of new technologies and critically acclaimed score by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], ''Final Fantasy IV'' is regarded as a landmark of the series and of the role-playing genre. It is considered to be one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, and is thought to have pioneered the idea of dramatic storytelling in an RPG. The various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. A sequel to the game, ''[[Final Fantasy IV: The After Years]]'', was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the [[Wii Shop Channel]] on June 1, 2009.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ff4wiki.PNG|thumb|left|A battle scene from the Super Nintendo version of the game: the party engages a Blue Dragon on the Moon]]
In ''Final Fantasy IV'', the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a [[Overworld#Navigation|world map]]. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination.<ref name="iiinstructions">{{cite book | year=1991 | editor=Square Co. | title=Final Fantasy II instruction manual | page=74 | publisher=Square Co. | id=SFS-F4-USA-1}}</ref> Conversely, the player fights monsters at [[random encounter|random intervals]] on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special options.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in your party; previous games had limited the party to four.<ref name="FFIVGametrailers"/>

Player characters and monsters have [[hit point]]s (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, at which point the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as a ''Potion'' which is known as a tonic. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize received damage.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in reserve. A character's placement impacts distribution of damage received and inflicted.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> The game's story is [[linearity (computer and video games)|linear]]<U+2014>the player can usually advance the game through only one path, although limited [[quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side quests]] are available.<ref name="allrpgreview">{{cite web | title=Review of Final Fantasy IV | date=2003-06-14 | url=http://www.allrpg.com/games/ff4/index.php3?page=review&num=1 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070706224046/http://www.allrpg.com/games/ff4/index.php3?page=review&num=1 | archivedate=2007-07-06 | publisher=AllRPG | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy IV'' introduced Square's [[Final Fantasy#Battle system|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]], who was one of the battle designers with [[Kazuhiko Aoki]] and [[Akihiko Matsui]], which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | title=Final Fantasy Advance instruction manual | page=22 | publisher=Square Enix | id=AGB-BZ4E-USA}}</ref> An important precedent, ATB was used in many subsequent Square games.<ref name="FFIVGametrailers"/>

Each character always is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other ''Final Fantasy'' games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either "[[Final Fantasy magic#White Magic|White]]" for healing and support; "[[Final Fantasy magic#Black Magic|Black]]" for offense; or "[[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|Summon]]" (or "call") for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized applications.<ref name="iiinstructions"/> A fourth type<U+2014>"[[Final Fantasy character classes#Ninja|Ninjutsu]]"<U+2014>consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The developers have balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of gaining levels.<ref name="rpgamerreview">{{cite web | author=Alley, Jake | title=Birth of the plot-driven RPG | date=2001-10-29 | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff4/reviews/ff4strev2.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> Due to the Super Nintendo's greater processing power, ''Final Fantasy IV'' contains graphics improved over past ''Final Fantasy'' titles and concurrent Super Nintendo games.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===

Most of ''Final Fantasy IV'' takes place on Earth, also known as the Blue Planet,<ref> '''Fusoya:''' Long ago, the world that lay between the Red Planet and the Great Behemoth stood at the verge of destruction, both terrible and complete. The last survivors of that devastation boarded a ship and escaped to the Blue Planet. / '''Cecil''': Blue Planet? / '''Fusoya''': The one that you call home. But your planet was still in the midst of its evolution, you see. And so those travelers created a second moon for the planet, and there they settled into a long and quiet slumber. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS}}</ref> which consists of a surface world (or [[Overworld]]) and an underground world (or Underworld) inhabited by the [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarves]]. A red, artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings from a world destroyed which became the [[asteroid belt]], and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created this artifical moon, resting until a time they believe their kind can co-exist with humans.<ref name="FFIVGametrailers"/> A second, natural moon orbits as well, though it is never visited in the game.

=== Characters ===

[[Image:FFIVkain.jpg|thumb|125px|Development sketch by [[Yoshitaka Amano]] of the character Kain]]
''Final Fantasy IV'' offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique, unchangeable [[character class]]. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dark Knight|dark knight]] and the captain of the Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragoon|Dragoons]]. Rosa Farrell is a [[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|white mage]]/[[Final Fantasy character classes#Hunter|archer]] and Cecil's girlfriend. The Red Wings' airships were constructed by Cecil's friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.<ref name="FFIVGametrailers"/>

During his quest, Cecil is joined by others, including Rydia, a young [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|summoner]] from the village of Mist, Tellah, a legendary [[Final Fantasy character classes#Sage|sage]] of Mysidia, Edward Chris von Muir, the prince of Damcyan and a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Bard|bard]], and Yang Fang Leiden, the head of the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Monk|monks]] of Fabul.

Cecil and Golbez are the respective hero and villain representing ''Final Fantasy IV'' in ''[[Dissidia: Final Fantasy]]''. Cecil is voiced by [[Shizuma Hodoshima]] in the Japanese version and by [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in the English version; Golbez is voiced by [[Takeshi Kaga]] in the Japanese version and by Peter Beckman in the English version.

=== Story ===
''Final Fantasy IV'' begins as the Red Wings are attacking the city of Mysidia to steal the Water Crystal there. When Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, afterwards questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist.<ref>'''King of Baron:''' This is most unfortunate, but I can place no trust on one who offers none in return. I hereby relieve you of command of the Red Wings. / '''Cecil:''' My liege! / '''King:''' You will go now to the Valley of Mist instead. There is a task I would have you do. A phantom creature haunts the borders of that land-the Eidolon of Mist. You will slay it and deliver this ring to the village that lies beyond&nbsp;<U+2014> they will know its meaning. Be gone by first light in the morning! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters from inside the package destroy the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons an earthquake in anger, separating Cecil and Kain.<ref>'''Rydia:''' Mother, you can't die! Just because your dragon did... {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby town. Baron soldiers come for Rydia, and Cecil defends her.<ref>'''Officer of Baron''': Our orders come directly from His Majesty's own mouth. Surrender the girl, and he will pardon all you've done. The inhabitants of Mist represent a threat to us all. They must not be allowed to live! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> 

Soon after, they meet Tellah, who is going to Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter.<ref>'''Tellah''': My daughter Anna was tricked by a silver-tongued bard. He's taken her to Damcyan Castle. I fear I've little time. I sense something sinister. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS| developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle. Edward, Anna's lover and the prince of Damcyan, explains that the Red Wings' new commander, Golbez, did this to steal the Fire Crystal for Baron as they had stolen the Water Crystal from Mysidia.<ref>'''Edward''': The Red Wings laid siege to us, led by a man named Golbez. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS| developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Tellah leaves the party to seek vengeance on Golbez for Anna's death.<ref>'''Tellah''': Tears do not bring back the dead, boy! Anna's death must be avenged. I'll find this Golbez! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Cecil, Edward, and Rydia decide to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal. There the Red Wings attack, and Kain reappears as one of Golbez's servants. He attacks and defeats Cecil; when Rosa intervenes, Golbez kidnaps her as Kain takes the crystal.<ref> '''Kain''': It's been some time, Cecil. / '''Cecil''': Kain! You're alive! / '''Kain''': I am. / '''Cecil''': You'll fight, then? / '''Kain''': Of course. That's the very reason I've come. But, Cecil...The one I'll fight is you! / '''Cecil''': Kain!? / '''Kain''': A duel, Cecil! / '''Cecil''': What do you mean? / '''Kain''': Draw your blade! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> On the way back to Baron, the party is attacked by [[Leviathan]] and thus separated.

Cecil awakes in Mysidia. There, he learns that to defeat Golbez, he must climb Mt. Ordeals and become a Paladin.<ref> '''Elder''': First you must ascend the mountain and trade your dark sword for one of light. Should the hallowed light deem you worthy, you will be made a paladin--a warrior of virtue. But know it will be no easy trail. Many are the man who have scaled the mountain, but not one has returned. Will you try where all others have failed? / '''Cecil''': I will! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> On the mountain he encounters Tellah, who is searching for the forbidden spell Meteor to defeat Golbez.<ref> '''Cecil''': Weren't you planning to go after Golbez?. /'''Tellah''': Yes, but my magic is no match for a man of his strength. I've been searching for the legendary magic of Meteor. It has been long sealed aswat, and I know not where. But I feel a powerful aura radiating from this place. I believe the spell I seek may well rest within this mountain. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Cecil becomes a Paladin, while Tellah learns the secret of Meteor. Upon reaching Baron the party confronts the King of Baron, only to discover that he had been replaced by one of Golbez's minions.<ref>'''Cecil''': What have you done with the king!? / '''"King of Baron"''': Would you like to go and see him, that king of yours? You best not mistake me for another Scarmiglione. How one as weak as he came to be crowned an archfiend is something I will never know. Mwa ha ha! / '''Cecil''': Then you're one of them! / '''"King of Baron"''': Behold! I am the Drowned King, Cagnazzo--archfiend of water and sworn servant of Golbez! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> After defeating him, Cid arrives and takes them to one of his airships.

On the airship, Kain appears and demands Cecil retrieve the final crystal in exchange for Rosa's life.<ref>'''Cecil:''' Where's Rosa? She's safe, I trust. / '''Kain:''' Heh. Worried about her, are you? If you wish to see Rosa alive, fetch me the Earth Crystal from the land of Troia.{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> After the crystal is retrieved, Kain leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah sacrifices himself to stop Golbez with Meteor, but only weakens him, although it does end Golbez's mind control of Kain.<ref>'''Golbez:''' So, the old man's interference severed my hold over you. No matter. Your purpose is served. Do not think this affront will be forgiven. / Cecil: Why...why now stay your hand?/Golbez: You're--You..But--how?...? We will finish this another time. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa and Rosa teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.

In Baron, Kain reveals that Golbez must also obtain four subterranean "Dark Crystals" to achieve his goal of reaching the moon.
<ref>'''Cecil''': Kain, we've lost the Earth Crystal. Golbez holds all them now. / '''Kain''': No. he holds four. / '''Rosa''': You mean to say there are more? / '''Cid''': Come to think it, I've heard tales of others! You speak of the Dark Crystals? / '''Kain''': I do. / '''Kain''': There is more. He said when all of the Crystals were gathered, the way to the moon would be opened. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> The party travels to the underworld and encounter the Dwarves who are currently fighting the Red Wings. They stop Golbez from stealing the Dwarves' crystal, and are rejoined by Rydia in the fight. They flee the underworld in the airship, and Cid sacrifices himself to reseal the passage to underworld.<ref>'''Cid:''' Once you breach surface, I'll seal off that hold for good--with this! / '''Rosa''': No! Not you too! / '''Cid''': I was hoping I'd get to see your kids someday, but, well--someone's got to keep Yang company! You get yourselves back to Baron. Talk to my boys there! / '''Rydia''': But Cid! You'll die! / '''Cid''': And so young, too! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> The party travels to the Tower of Babil where the crystals are being kept. When they reach the crystal room, the party falls through a trap door to the underworld. The heroes go to retrieve the eighth crystal before Golbez. Upon retrieving it, Golbez reveals he still has control over Kain, and takes the crystal.<ref> '''Golbez''': Kain...Return to me, my pawn...Deliver to me the Crystal... / '''Cecil''': Golbez! / '''Cecil''': Kain! / Rosa: Don't listen! Resist him! / '''Kain''': It's alright. I...I'm back in control of myself. / '''Edge''': You filthy double-crosser! / '''Rosa''': Kain. What are you doing!? /'''Golbez''': You underestimate the strength of my abilities. I had but slackened your friend's leash, waiting for the proper moment to pull it taut. With this final Crystal, the Tower of Babil will be made complete. Come, Kain. / '''Cecil''': Kain! Don't listen to him! Kain! / '''Kain''': The Crystals are all assembled. We can open the way to the moon at last! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> After learning of the Lunar Whale, a ship designed to take travelers to and from the moon, the party is rejoined by Cid, and travels to the surface and boards the ship.<ref> '''Elder:''' She is risen! The promised Ship of Light... The Lunar Whale! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref>

On the moon, the party meets the sage Fusoya, who explains that Cecil's father was a Lunarian.<ref> ''''Cecil''': And the Lunar Whale, where did it come from? / '''Fusoya''': Ah, the ship...My younger brother KluYa built that vessel long ago, and flew it to the Blue Planet. He took with him several of our secrets, such as the ones employed in your Devil's Road and in airships--a gift to your people. Kluya was fascinated by your planet and wished to know more about it. And while he was there, he fell in love with a woman of your planet. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take it over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot.<ref> '''Fusoya''': He thought it fit that we should simply raze all existing life on the Blue Planet and claim it as our own. / '''Rydia''': That's horrible... / '''Fusoya''': Yes. And so I used my powers to force him into hibernation with the others. But as he slept, his will grew stronger and took on a consciousness all its own. It reached out to men with tainted hearts on your planet, twisting them into beings yet darker still. And through them, he began to gather the Crystals. / '''Cecil''': So he was manipulating Golbez! / '''Edge''': Does this guy have a name? / '''Fusoya''': His name is Zemus. The Crystals function as a source of energy you see. I fear he has gathered them in order to activate the interdimenional elevator within the Tower of Babil. With it, he will be able to transport the Giant of Babil to your planet and use it to extinguish all life there.{{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> They return to Earth and the forces of the two worlds attack the Giant. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother.<ref>'''Golbez:''' My father... His name was Kluya. / '''Rosa:''' That you're Cecil's own... / '''Edge:''' Brother!? {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus.<ref> '''Zeromus''': I am the wellspring of darkness, fed by Zemus's unbridled hate. I am He who is called Zeromus... I am He who know naught but hate! {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> Cecil and his allies defeat Zeromus.  Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon.<ref>'''Golbez:''' I cannot return. Not after I have done. And I would very much like to meet my father's people. At least one time. {{cite video game | title =Final Fantasy IV DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-07-22 | platform =Nintendo DS }}</ref> In an epilogue we see Kain atop Mt. Ordeals while everyone else reunites to celebrate Cecil and Rosa's wedding and their coronation as Baron's new king and queen.

== Development ==

After completing ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'' in 1990, Square planned to develop two ''Final Fantasy'' games<U+2014>one for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Famicom]] and the other for the forthcoming [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]], to be known as ''Final Fantasy IV'' and ''Final Fantasy V'' respectively.<ref name="lostlevels">{{cite web | author=Collette, Chris | year=2003 | title=Elusions: Final Fantasy IV / Seiken Densetsu | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200311/200311-square.shtml | publisher=Lost Levels Online | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref> Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the Famicom game and continued development of the Super Famicom version, retitled ''Final Fantasy IV''. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it.<ref name="lostlevels"/>

''Final Fantasy IV'' was lead designer [[Takashi Tokita]]'s first project at Square as a full time employee. Before this, Tokita wanted to make a career as a theater actor, but working on the game made him decide to become a "great creator" of video games.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hayashi, Koichiro | title=Square Enix Discusses DS | date=2004-10-17 | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3135760 | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> Initially [[Hiromichi Tanaka]], the main designer of ''Final Fantasy III'', was also involved in the development of the game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not menu-driven, and since ''Final Fantasy IV'' was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' instead.<ref>{{cite web | author=Nickel, Thomas | title=Hiromichi Tanaka - Final Fantasy III | date=2006 | url=http://www.g-wie-gorilla.de/content/view/218/18/ | publisher=g-wie-gorilla.de | accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> The development team of ''Final Fantasy IV'' was composed of 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.<ref name="gamebrink">{{cite web | author=Xcomp | title=Final Fantasy IV DS Interview | date=2007-05-31 | url=http://www.gamebrink.com/blog/2007/05/31/final-fantasy-iv-ds-interview | publisher=GameBrink | accessdate=2009-12-11 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080415081941rn_1/www.gamebrink.com/blog/2007/05/31/final-fantasy-iv-ds-interview | archivedate=2008-04-15}}</ref>

He stated that there was a lot of pressure and that the project would not have been completed if he did not work directly on it. According to Tokita, ''Final Fantasy IV'' was designed with the best parts of the previous three installments in mind: the job system of ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', the focus on story of ''[[Final Fantasy II]]'', and the four elemental bosses acting as "symbols for the game" as in the [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first installment]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Xcomp | title=Final Fantasy IV DS Interview | date=2007-05-31 | url=http://www.gamebrink.com/blog/2007/05/31/final-fantasy-iv-ds-interview | publisher=GameBrink | accessdate=2009-12-11 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080415081941rn_1/www.gamebrink.com/blog/2007/05/31/final-fantasy-iv-ds-interview | archivedate=2008-04-15}}</ref> Other influences include ''[[Dragon Quest II]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 2008|title=Final Fantasy IV Interview|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=Nintendo Power|volume=1|issue=228|issn=1041-9551}}</ref> The themes of ''Final Fantasy IV'' were to go "from darkness to light" with Cecil, a focus on family and friendship bonds with the large and diverse cast,<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Final Fantasy IV DS Interview | date=2009-08-03 | url=http://wii.ign.com/dor/objects/14325764/final-fantasy-iv-the-after-years/videos/ffafteryears_trl_tokitainterview_8309.html;jsessionid=8il43ujktzw2?show=hi | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2009-12-11 | format=Flash}}</ref> and the idea that "brute strength alone isn't power".<ref name="qa part 2" /> Tokita feels that ''Final Fantasy IV'' is the first game in the series to really pick up on drama,<ref name="gamebrink" /> and the first Japanese RPG to feature "such deep characters and plot".<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Final Fantasy IV Fan-Powered Q&A Part 3 | date=2008-09-19 | url=http://member.square-enix.com/na/features/ff4/02/part3.php | publisher=Square Enix | accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref>

The game's script had to be reduced to one fourth of its original length due to cartridge storage limits, but Tokita made sure only "unnecessary dialogue" was cut rather than actual story elements. As the graphical capacities of the Super Famicom allowed [[Yoshitaka Amano]] to make more elaborate character designs than in the previous installments, with the characters' personalities already evident from the images, Tokita felt the reduced script length improved the pacing of the game.<ref name="gamebrink" /><ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Final Fantasy IV Fan-Powered Q&A Part 1 | date=2008-09-05 | url=http://member.square-enix.com/na/features/ff4/02/ | publisher=Square Enix | accessdate=2009-12-11}}</ref> Still, he acknowledges that some parts of the story were "unclear" or were not "looked at in depth" until later ports and remakes of the game. One of the ideas not included, due to time and space constraints, was a dungeon near the end of the game where each character would have to progress on their own<U+2014>this dungeon would only be included in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, as the Lunar Ruins.<ref name="gamebrink" /> 

===Music===
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy IV}}
The score of ''Final Fantasy IV'' was written by longtime series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square Co. headquarters. His liner notes were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM "in the office, naturally."<ref>{{cite web | author=Uematsu, Nobuo | title=Final Fantasy IV OSV Liner Notes | staff=Rebecca Capowski | date=1991-04-13 | url=http://chudahs-corner.com/liners/index.php?catalog=PSCN-5014 | publisher=Square | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> The score was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium.<ref name="allrpgreview"/><ref name="rpgfanreview"/> The track "Theme of Love" has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hitmitsu, Suppai | title=Final Fantasy Becomes Curriculum | publisher=IGN | date=2004-03-31 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/503/503226p1.html | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref> Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his ''Final Fantasy'' concert series.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schneider, Peer | title=Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy | publisher=IGN | date=2005-05-11| url=http://music.ign.com/articles/513/513292p1.html | accessdate=2006-03-01}}</ref>

Three [[album]]s of music from ''Final Fantasy IV'' have been released in Japan. The first album, ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version|Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version]]'', was released on June 14, 1991 and contains 44 tracks from the game. The second album was ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon|Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon]]'', released on October 24, 1991, contains a selection of tracks from the game, [[Arrangement|arranged]] and performed by [[Celtic music]]ian [[M<U+00E1>ire Breatnach]]. Lastly, ''[[Music of Final Fantasy IV#Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV|Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections]]'', an arrangement of tracks for solo piano performed by [[Toshiyuki Mori]], was released on April 21, 1992 and began the ''Piano Collections'' trend for each successive ''Final Fantasy'' game. Several tracks have appeared on ''Final Fantasy'' compilation albums produced by Square, including ''[[The Black Mages (album)|The Black Mages]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy: Pray]]''. Independent but officially licensed releases of ''Final Fantasy IV'' music have been orchestrated by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focused on arranging video game music.<ref>{{cite web | author=KFSS Studios | title=Music Store | publisher=MajesticMix.com | year=2002 | url=http://www.majesticmix.com/documents/music.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070626165226/http://www.majesticmix.com/documents/music.html | archivedate=2007-06-26 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called [[dojin music]], and on English remixing websites such as [[OverClocked ReMix]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Game: Final Fantasy IV (1991, Square, SNES) - OverClocked ReMix | url=http://www.ocremix.org/game/final-fantasy-iv-snes/ | publisher=[[OverClocked ReMix]] | accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

=== North American localization ===

Because the previous two installments of the ''Final Fantasy'' series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, ''Final Fantasy IV'' was distributed as ''Final Fantasy II'' to maintain naming continuity. Later remakes of the game have been released in North America under the original title. While the game retains the storyline, graphics, and sound of the original, developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers.<ref name="ignreview"/> Certain character descriptions and elements of backstory have been cut due to space limitations. For instance, Kain's background and relationship with his father and the motivations for Zemus's plans to colonize Earth are not in the game.<ref name="mobygamestrivia">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy IV Trivia | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/final-fantasy-iv/trivia | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref> Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. The magic spell ''Holy'' was renamed ''White''. All references to [[prayer]] were eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia was renamed the Tower of Wishes, though the White Mage in the tower still calls it "Tower of Prayers," and Rosa's ''Pray'' command is absent. Direct references to death were omitted, although several characters clearly die over the course of the game.<ref name="GametrailersRemakes"/> The translation was changed in accordance with Nintendo of America's [[censorship]] policies (at the time before the formation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and its rating system).<ref>{{cite web | title=25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming / Nintendo's Mortal Mistake | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/index4.shtml | date=2003-06-14 | author=GameSpy Staff | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=2006-03-06}}</ref>

== Re-releases ==
{{seealso|Final Fantasy Chronicles|Final Fantasy Anthology|Final Fantasy IV (Nintendo DS)}}
In addition to its original release, ''Final Fantasy IV'' has been remade into many different versions. The first of these was ''Final Fantasy IV Easytype'', a modified version of the game was released for the Super Famicom in Japan. The ''Easytype'' was modified to be even easier than its North American counterpart. In this version, the attack powers of weapons have been enhanced, while the protective abilities of certain accessories and armor are amplified.<ref name="ignreview"/>

A PlayStation re-release debuted in Japan on March 21, 1997. Ported by [[TOSE]] and published by [[Square Co.]], it was designed and directed by [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai.<ref name="Chronicles">{{cite book | year=2001 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | page=54 | publisher=Square Enix | id=SLUS-01360}}</ref> This version is identical to the original game, although minor tweaks introduced in the ''Easytype'' are present.

This version was later released with ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' in North America as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001 and with ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' in Europe and Australia as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Anthology]]'' in 2002. The English localizations feature a new translation, although certain lines from the previous localization by [[Kaoru Moriyama]] - such as "You spoony bard!" - were kept, as they had become fan favorites.<ref name="ffcompendium-bard">{{cite web | title=Famous Moments in Final Fantasy | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/h/moment.shtml | publisher=FFCompendium | accessdate=2006-09-12}}</ref> A remake for the [[WonderSwan Color]], with few changes from the PlayStation version, was released in Japan on March 28, 2002.
