'''Cave of the Crystals''' or '''Giant Crystal Cave''' ({{Lang-es|Cueva de los Cristales}}) is a [[cave]] connected to the [[Naica Mine]] {{Convert|300|m}} below the surface in [[Naica]],  [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]. The main chamber contains giant [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] [[crystals]] ([[gypsum]], CaSO<sub>4</sub><U+00B7>2 H<sub>2</sub>O), some of the largest natural crystals ever found.<ref name = "Mystery"/> The cave's largest crystal found to date is {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} in length, {{Convert|4|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and 55&nbsp;tons in weight. The cave is extremely hot with air temperatures reaching up to {{Convert|58|C}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/photogalleries/giant-crystals-cave/|title=Giant Crystal Cave Comes to Light|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref> with 90 to 99 percent humidity. The cave is relatively unexplored due to these factors.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8466493.stm |title=A rare glimpse of the cave of crystals | work= BBC News|date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>  Without proper protection people can only endure approximately ten minutes of exposure at a time.<ref name = "Shea">{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Shea |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text/1 |title=Crystal palace | work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic magazine]] |date=November 2008 | accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>

A group of scientists known as the ''Naica Project'' have been heavily involved in researching these caverns.<ref name = "Project">{{cite web | title = NAICA Project web site | publisher = NAICA Project| url = http://www.naica.com.mx/english/index.htm

==Formation of the crystals==
Naica lies on an ancient fault and there is an underground [[magma]] chamber below the cave. The magma heated the ground water and it became saturated with minerals, including large quantities of gypsum. The hollow space of the cave was filled with this mineral-rich hot water and remained filled for about 500,000 years. During this time, the temperature of the water remained very stable at over 50&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (122&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). This allowed crystals to form and grow to immense sizes.<ref>[http://www.stormchaser.ca/Caves/Naica/Naica.html Crystal Cave of Giants, Naica, Mexico <U+2013> Sept. 2009]. www.stormchaser.ca. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.</ref>

==Discovery==
In 1910 miners discovered a cavern beneath the Naica mine workings, the Cave of Swords ({{Lang-es|Cueva de las Espadas}}). It is located at a depth of 120&nbsp;m, above the Cave of Crystals, and contains spectacular, smaller (1&nbsp;m long) crystals.  It is speculated that at this level, transition temperatures may have fallen much more rapidly, leading to an end in the growth of the crystals.<ref name = "Mystery">{{cite web

The Giant Crystal cave was discovered in 2000 by miners excavating a new tunnel for the [[Industrias Pe<U+00F1>oles]] mining company located in Naica, Mexico,<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/loc-2308.html Naica, Mun. de Saucillo, Chihuahua, Mexico]. Mindat.org</ref> while drilling through the Naica [[Fault (geology)|fault]], which they were concerned would flood the mine.<ref>[http://www.crystalinks.com/mexicocrystals.html Mexico's Cave of Giant Crystals]. crystalinks.com</ref> The mining complex in Naica contains substantial deposits of [[silver]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]]. 

The Cave of Crystals is a horseshoe-shaped cavity in [[limestone]]. Its floor is covered with perfectly-faceted crystalline blocks. Huge crystal beams jut out from both the blocks and the floor. The caves are accessible today because the mining company's pumping operations keep them clear of water. If the pumping were stopped, the caves would again be submerged.  The crystals deteriorate in air, so the Naica Project is attempting to visually document the crystals before they deteriorate further.<ref name="Visual rescue">[http://www.naica.com.mx/english/internas/interna2_1.htm Visual rescue] at Naica Project</ref>

Two other smaller caverns were also discovered in 2000, the Queen<U+2019>s Eye Cave and the Candles<U+2019> Cave,<ref name="Visual rescue"/> and a further chamber was found in a drilling project in 2009. The new cave, named the Ice Palace, is 150&nbsp;m deep and is not flooded, but its crystal formations are much smaller, with small 'cauliflower' formations and fine, threadlike crystals.<ref name = "IcePalace">{{cite web

== Exploration and scientific studies ==
A scientific team coordinated by [[Paolo Forti]], specialist of cave minerals and crystallographer at the [[University of Bologna]] (Italy) explored the cave in detail in 2006. To survive and to be able to work in the extreme temperature and humid conditions which prevent prolonged incursion in the crystal chamber, they developed their own refrigerated suits and cold breathing systems (respectively dubbed Tolomea suit and  Sinusit respirator). Special caving overalls were fitted with a mattress of refrigerating tubes placed all over the body and connected to a backpack weighing about 20&nbsp;kg (44&nbsp;lbs) containing a reservoir filled with cold water and ice. The [[latent heat]] of ice fusion was sufficient to provide about half an hour of autonomy.

Beside mineralogical and crystallographic studies, biogeochemical and microbial characterization of the gypsum giant crystals were also performed. [[Stein-Erik Lauritzen]] ([[University of Bergen]], Norway) performed [[uranium-thorium dating]] to determine the maximum age of the giant crystals, about 500,000 years.<ref>{{Cite conference

[[Penelope Boston]] ([[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]]), [[speleologist]] and [[geomicrobiologist]] specialist  of [[extremophile]] organisms realized sterile sampling of [[gypsum]] drillcores by making small boreholes inside large crystals under aseptic conditions. The aim was to detect the possible presence of ancient bacteria encapsulated inside fluid and solid inclusions present the [[calcium sulfate]] matrix from its formation.

Solid inclusions mainly consist of [[brucite|magnesium]] and [[ferrihydrite|iron oxy-hydroxide]] but no [[natural organic matter|organic matter]] could be found associated with the solid hydroxides. No [[DNA]] from ancient [[bacteria]] could be extracted from the solid inclusions and amplified by [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].

Microbial studies on [[fluid inclusions]] are foreseen to attempt to evidence the presence of ancient micro-organisms in the original fluid solution in which the crystals developed.

Other researches also cover the fields of [[palynology]] ([[pollen]] study), geochemistry, hydrogeology and the physical conditions prevailing in the Cave of Crystal.

== Future closure ==
The cave was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[Naica: Beyond The Crystal Cave]]'' in February 2011. Exploration hinted at the existence of further chambers, but further exploration would have required demolition of the crystals. It was stated that the cave would eventually be resealed and the water level allowed to rise again.<ref>{{cite press release|title=NAICA: "Beyond the crystal cave and deadly descent" video reveals worlds beneath the Earth<U+2019>s surface, February 13 on Discovery Channel|publisher=ctvmedia.com|date=February 8, 2011|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/discovery/releases/release.asp?id=13468&yyyy=2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>
