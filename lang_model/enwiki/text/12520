'''Swine Hill''' ({{coor dm|71|24|S|67|33|W|}}) is the southernmost of two rugged, rocky knolls, 550&nbsp;nautical miles (1000&nbsp;km), standing 10&nbsp;nautical miles (18&nbsp;km) west-northwest of the summit of [[Mount Bagshawe]] on the west coast of [[Palmer Land]] and overlooking [[Gadarene Lake]] and [[George VI Sound]]. The feature was first seen and photographed from the air on [[November 23]], [[1935]] by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], and was mapped from these photographs by [[W.L.G. Joerg]]. It was roughly surveyed in 1936 by the [[British Graham Land Expedition]] (BGLE) under Rymill, and resurveyed in 1948 by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (FIDS) who erected a cairn on the summit. Named by FIDS for its association with Gadarene Lake and the incident of the Gadarene swine.
