'''Jagex Ltd.''' (or '''Jagex Software''') are a [[United Kingdom]]-based producer of [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based online [[computer game]]s. According to developer Paul Gower, Jagex stands for '''Ja'''va '''G'''aming '''Ex'''perts.<ref>http://kbase.runescape.com/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2449</ref> The company are best-known for their [[MMORPG]], ''[[RuneScape]].'' 

== History ==

'''Jagex Software''' was founded in November [[1999]] by [[Andrew Gower]], Paul Gower, and Constant Tedder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://kbase.runescape.com/viewarticle.ws?article_id=2449|title= What is Jagex?|accessdate= |accessmonthday= 09-10|accessyear= 2006|author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006|month= |format= |work= |publisher= Jagex|pages= |language= English|archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref> The aim of this company was to create and license Java games for websites. In December [[2001]], the company focused on their primary game, the [[MMORPG]] ''[[RuneScape]]''. The company then became '''Jagex Ltd.''' At the time of the company's formation, ''RuneScape'' had already been created and more than one million accounts had been registered. The first tasks of the company were to create a version of the game with extra features that required a <U+00A3>3.20 ($5.00 [[USD]]) monthly fee, while still offering the free version, and to develop partnerships with advertisers. Both tasks were achieved, and the pay-to-play version of ''RuneScape'' was released on [[February 27]], [[2002]], gaining 5,000 subscriptions in the first week. Currently, ''RuneScape'' has over 9,000,000 free players and approximately 850,000 pay-to-play subscribers as of [[July 17]], [[2006]].<ref>[http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/adwatch/?id=13256&page=1 "WildTangent Explores RuneScape"] - GameDaily BIZ, [[17 July]] [[2006]]. Retrieved [[30 July]] [[2006]].</ref> In [[2006]], founders Andrew Gower and Paul Gower were calculated to be worth [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>32 million]] ($60 million [[United States dollar|USD]]). Andrew Gower is also known for his varieties of java games.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,39448,00.html www.timesonline.co.uk] - Rich List 2006, accessed 22 May 2006</ref>

==Operation==

Jagex have grown since the founding of the company in 1999. Jagex now has two offices, one in [[Cambridge]] and one in [[London]]. The company have been recruiting heavily in 2006 and now have 302 staff members as of [[August 13]] [[2006]], grouped into the Development, Publishing, Web Content, Minigame and Customer Relations teams. Jagex continue to add more "worlds" (or servers) to expand the area in which players can play, focusing on adding servers in Asia.

They have many servers in various locations all over the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. On June 2 2006, Jagex added new servers into Vancouver, which gave them a total of 138 paying and free servers worldwide. On [[20 November]] [[2006]], Jagex relocated six of its servers to Finland to increase the spread of European play.

==Beyond ''RuneScape''==

While most of the work by Jagex staff now deals with ''RuneScape'', they still maintain a few other games that one can play online at their website. These games are:

*''Meltdown''
*''Vertigo''
*''Flea Circus''
*''Gold Mine''
*''Monkey Puzzle''
*''Fuel Critical'' Stage 1-3

These games can be accessed at the company's website.

For a time it was stated on the Jagex Corporate site that a new MMORPG unrelated to RuneScape was in planning as far back as mid-2005, as well as a goal to gain over 1,000,000 paying members. This has since been taken down at the start of 2006, with a new goal of reaching over 900,000 subscribers and to take RuneScape into other non-English languages.

Jagex are working on a new undisclosed game. Although no official information has been released about this as of yet it is said to be another [[computer role-playing game|RPG]] due to the roles described in the job:<ref>[http://www.jagex.com/corporate/jobs.ws Jagex Jobs page]</ref>

<blockquote>Your role will primarily be to build creatures, shape virtual worlds, design quests and storylines for our new, undisclosed game.</blockquote>

Jagex have started rumours indicating that they are to release their new game in February 2008.{{cn}}

It could be a Sci-Fi based game rather than a fantasy based setting as in RuneScape. This information comes from the job requirements for (Junior) Concept Artist/3D Modeller on the Jagex jobs page:

<blockquote>An interest in sci-fi is a bonus.</blockquote>

== Other games ==
The games listed below were removed during mid-2004 and are currently unavailable.  There has been no statement by Jagex as to whether the games will be returning or not.  In the meantime, Jagex have focused resources on RuneScape.

The past games Jagex used to offer were:

* [[Tetralink]] 
* [[Cyber Wars]]
* [[Battleship (game)|Warship]]
* [[Checkers]] 
* [[Chess]]
* [[Reversi]] 
* Go-mad 
* [[SlimeWar]]
* Crypt
* The Bottomless Pit, although this was not actually a game, but meant as a humorous animation. The animations showed the viewer falling down a bottomless pit for a long period of time. After ten minutes, some cheats were revealed to the user, however none of them worked for RuneScape.
