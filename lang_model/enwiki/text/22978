'''Wally Brown''' ([[October 9]], [[1904]] - [[November 13]], [[1961]]) was an actor, comedian, and long-time partner of [[Alan Carney]].

Wally was born in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] and served as a [[vaudevillian]]. In 1942, he wanted to start business in Hollywood at [[RKO Radio Pictures]] with the film ''[[Petticoat Larceny]]''. When RKO decided to emulate with [[Abbott and Costello]], he met [[Alan Carney]], which they became "Brown & Carney" and settled down on the film ''[[Adventures of a Rookie]]'' later with its sequel ''[[Rookies in Burma]]''. Their best film was ''[[Zombies on Broadway]]''. Their contracts were terminated in 1946 and reunited in 1961 in ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]''. His last years were promptly as guest appearances, typically his last one on ''[[My Three Sons]]''. Along with Alan Carney, he was going to be picked for ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', but he couldn't play any parts because of his death two years before. In the 1940s&ndash;50s, both have been desperately chosen in a role for [[Leslie Goodwins]] films. Wally Brown has also been a regular cast member in television shows like ''[[I Married Joan]]'', ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'', and ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]''.
He also served as a regular on ''The [[Abbott and Costello]] Show'' on radio.
