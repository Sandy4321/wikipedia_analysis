The '''Combine''' is a fictional alien race and empire from [[Valve Corporation]]'s [[2004]] [[first-person shooter]] [[computer game]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. The empire spans universes, and consists of a range of species, including humans. An oppressor of humanity, it produces propaganda as a psychological solution to resistance, and is also referred to by its human supporters as the '''Universal Union''' and '''"Our Benefactors"'''. 
==Overview==
[[Image:HL2-Combine.jpg|thumb|200px|A hologram of a '''Combine Advisor'''.]] The Combine is an empire spanning multiple [[Multiverse (science)|parallel universe]]s. The empire is inhabited by an unknown number of [[Sapience|sapient]] species, and appears to be governed by a race of artificially evolved "Advisors", resembling giant grubs. The Combine expands its empire by invading worlds and enslaving the dominant species to be exploited as it sees fit. By manipulating these inhabitants through methods including bioengineering and implantation, the Combine creates a race of [[supersoldier|super-soldier]]s uniquely adapted for the environment of that particular world.

Until recently, many players speculated that the Combine may have possibly controlled the fictional "border world", [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], based on the similarities to some practices and technologies used by its [[Nihilanth]] dwellers. However, [[Valve Software]]'s Doug Lombardi has stated that the Combine had, in fact, invaded the Nihilanth's race's homeworld, leaving no option but escape. The defeated Nihilanth, along with the other Xen creatures, sought refuge in Xen, where the Combine could not (or would not) follow.<ref name="PC Zone Sep 05">''[[PC Zone]]'' magazine, September 2005.</ref> Xen has been described as a "dimensional transit bottleneck, an area of continual contention."<ref name="Laidlaw Xen email">[[Marc Laidlaw]]'s [http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mailbag.Detail&id=5#mailbag e-mail on Xen], [[Planet Half-Life]] Mailbag.</ref>

Subsequent to the invasion of Nihilanth's unnamed homeworld, [[Earth]] is the Combine's most recent known annexation, acquired following Earth's surrender at the end of the [[Seven Hour War]]. Following the standard Combine process, members of Earth's dominant species have been modified to form a new arm of the Combine military. While these soldiers are primarily used as a permanent Combine garrison on Earth, in-game dialogue suggests that humans are used as soldiers and slaves across the Combine Empire. In-game Overwatch broadcasts frequently threaten civilians and Combine soldiers alike with "permanent off-world relocation."

==Leadership==
[[Image:Ep1 citadel 010002.png|thumb|left|A Combine Advisor contained inside an escape pod in the Citadel]]
The Combine Advisors are the face of the Combine Empire, suggesting that they are probably the original master race behind it. They are seen briefly in ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' one having a conversation with Breen (it is hard to see because the monitor is turned off as the player arrives), but are shown more prominently in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'', affecting the overall plot significantly. Physically, they resemble large [[larva|grub]]-like creatures.

In ''Episode One'', they are shown preparing to evacuate themselves from the damaged Citadel while their soldiers are ordered to overload the Citadel's central core reactor to send a message to the Combine "overworld". This indicates that they are of a high position in the known Combine hierarchy, as their subordinates know they will die when the reactor detonates after the Advisors have used their personal escape pods to flee.

An Advisor is about as large as a [[rhinoceros]]. Advisors are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their "head." Their "faces" are covered by what may be some form of [[respirator]], though the hose attached to it does not lead to any obvious tank. This respirator is later seen to lift, revealing a mouth-like [[orifice]] from which extends a long flexible [[proboscis]] with which they can examine objects and attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be in some way feeding upon their victim during their attacks. Advisors rest inside a metal cradle which has two slender mechanical claw-like arms protruding from the upper section. Each Advisor wears a stitched olive-green body suit, leaving only the mostly featureless "face" and part of the tail fully visible. The suit also has a black collar adorned with golden [[logogram|hieroglyph]]s.

Despite their inactive physical state, the Advisors seem to have become highly evolved mentally. They are never heard speaking in-game, and yet Doctor Wallace Breen (The highest ranking pro-Combine human) is observed having an extended conversation with one, suggesting some form of [[telepathy]]. In ''Episode Two'' it is shown that they also seem to make use of [[telekinesis]] to move or pick up objects as they please<U+2014> including themselves. When injured, such as one inside an incubator pod near the end of the "Riding Shotgun" chapter, they emit high-pitched squeals and either fly or crawl like maggots away from their initial area. The Advisors also seem to somehow telepathically attack both Alyx and Gordon several times in ''Episode Two'' causing blindness, headache, loss of balance and temporary paralysis.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Advisor ep2.jpg|thumb|Combine Advisor from Episode Two, just about to strike with a tentacle-like tongue]] --> 
Advisors are used in Episode Two as a cinematic device. Since cutscenes are not present in the Half-Life series, the Advisor's ability to immobilize the player is useful in that it allows the action to be viewed from one angle. Recent concept art for ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Three]]'' confirm the appearance of more Advisors in a Citadel-type arctic structure.

In ''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]'', designer Ted Backman mentions that the immense, worm-like form of the Combine Advisor was inspired by the work of [[Frank Herbert]].

==Teleportation==
Despite the advanced technology level of the Combine race, it seems to be lacking mastery of [[teleportation]] in relation to human rebel scientists. [[Judith Mossman|Dr. Mossman]] explains that the Combine can only teleport from one universe to another, but not to different locations in the same universe. The teleportation method used by [[Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Kleiner]] and [[Eli Vance|Dr. Vance]] (and indeed by the other Black Mesa scientists and even the Nihilanth before and during the Black Mesa Incident) is of great interest to the Combine. Dr. Mossman was actually helping the Combine build a teleporter capable of this in [[Nova Prospekt]], and in fact succeeded; however, the technique was apparently not implemented by the Combine in any other context besides the Citadel and Nova Prospekt before both were destroyed. The teleporter in Nova Prospekt was also imperfect; in addition to exploding after teleporting Freeman and Alyx it also malfunctioned and it took them a whole week to complete their trip through the teleport, though this could be due to damage received through weapons fire in the chamber rather than a design flaw of the Combine teleport.

The Combine's method of teleportation, as limited as it is, still requires a large amount of power and huge machinery to perform, as seen at the end of the game, where [[Doctor Wallace Breen|Dr. Breen]] was attempting to escape from the Citadel using a Combine teleporter (called a Tunneling-Entanglement device). This teleporter required an entire reactor, called the "Dark Fusion reactor," to power it, while the teleporters designed by humans require only small amounts of power, and very little machinery in comparison. The handheld portal device depicted in ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' (which is set in the ''Half-Life'' universe), for example, can open rifts between two locations and is roughly the size of the Gravity Gun with no external power supply. Xen teleporters seem to require even less machinery &ndash; sometimes apparently none at all. However, this could be due to the nature of Xen rather than Xenian technology. The reason for this is that Humans are able to exploit the "border world" of [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] to slingshot from Earth to Xen and back, arriving in a slightly different location. This is mentioned by Dr. Rosenberg in ''Blue Shift''.  The Combine has apparently not mastered this technique, instead employing a brute-force approach to dimensional travel.  The advantage of this technique appears to be the ability to tunnel directly to distant universes rather than simply visiting an adjacent one.

==On Earth==
===Invasion===

{{See also|Seven Hour War}}
Following the [[Nihilanth]]'s demise, the Combine were able to use the portal storm that was occurring at the time to continue on to Earth, where it launched a massive invasion that culminated in the [[Seven Hour War]]. Statements made by the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]] suggest that the human race was unable to mount any effective resistance to the Combine armies, and that Earth's military forces were almost instantly overwhelmed. Former administrator of the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]], [[Doctor Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], negotiated a surrender on Earth's behalf and was therefore appointed the administrator of the Combine's forces on Earth&ndash; the ''Overwatch''.

===Dominance===
The Combine rule Earth from towers known as Citadels, with the one featured Citadel being in [[City 17]] where Dr. Breen runs his administration. As Doctor Breen attempts to teleport off of Earth using a teleporter, a massive portal is created and, through it, several buildings that resemble Citadels are visible.

At the start of the game, the Combine appear to have almost complete dominance of the remaining pockets of civilized Earth, and do not identify [[Gordon Freeman]]. However, [[Wallace Breen|Doctor Breen]] immediately informs a Combine Advisor of Freeman's appearance during a teleport accident in which Gordon Freeman appeared in Doctor Breen's office for a brief period of time. Only a few handfuls of loosely organized resistance forces secretly oppose the Combine. Gordon Freeman's actions after his return eventually inspire a massive insurrection against the Combine in City 17, which results in a full-scale street war between the citizens and the Combine forces.

The reasons behind the Combine's desire to control the Earth are unknown, other than the absorption of Earth's resources, the use of human teleporter technology and the enslavement and exploitation of its dominant species &ndash; the humans &ndash; for either menial work or military service.

===Suppression field===

The Combine, since gaining dominance on Earth, has imposed something known as a ''suppression field''. The suppression field's main function is to bring the human birth rate down to zero by prohibiting certain protein chains important to embryonic development from forming, I.E. a sperm fertilizing an egg. This effectively ensures that the humans currently alive will be the last generation. Doctor Breen addresses this issue to the people via a broadcast during the early levels of ''Half-Life 2'', as the response to a letter written to him by a "concerned citizen," and claims that the field will be deactivated once the humans prove they no longer need it by losing natural instinct (this is a deliberate play on words on Breen's part, however - it means the field will be deactivated when it ''is no longer needed'' to suppress human natural instinct.) During the game, resistance members occasionally make humorous remarks such as: "When this is all over, I'm gonna mate," about the suppression field. It was initially thought that the suppression field somehow prevented human sexual urges, mainly due to Dr. Breen's statement that it was suppressing "the ''urge'' to reproduce" - however, these statements prove it wrong, showing humans still have the urge.

In ''[[Half Life 2: Episode One]]'', it is revealed by [[Doctor Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Isaac Kleiner]] during his transmissions throughout the city, that with the near destruction of the Citadel, the suppression field has been disabled. He suggests that "everyone thus inclined [...] should do their part" in the re-population of the human species if they have escaped City 17, "before the Combine attempt to restore their dominion." Upon hearing this, [[Alyx Vance]] asked Gordon "Is Dr. Kleiner really telling everyone to... 'get busy'?"

===Mind alteration===
Comments at the train station at the start of the game suggest that the Combine have been drugging (if not outright poisoning) the populace through their water supply. One aged citizen remarks "Don't drink the water...they put something in it, to make you forget. I don't even remember how I got here." This is not mentioned outside this one piece of dialogue; but the idea is reinforced by the numerous soda machines stocked with "DR BREENS PRIVATE RESERVE", which freely dispense water in a standard 355 [[Litre|mL]] (12 [[Fluid ounce|fl. oz.]]) can (although, if anything, this water is more likely to be contaminated than any other, as well as almost certainly not being from Breen's private reserve). In addition, a Combine radio transmission to Civil Protection officers states: "Reminder, memory replacement is the first step to rank privileges."

The insinuated reason for this supposed mind control is so that humans forget why they hate the Combine, and will willingly accede to their (and Breen's) demands, and to create a fresh new template (the human's mind) for forced re-education.

Information about forced memory replacement can be found in the game's data files, in this specific model named "soldier bed", seen later inside the Citadel during ''Episode One''. This model closely resembles that of concept art in ''Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar''. The machine itself consists of Combine emitters and equipment, attached is an arm-like device holding a human body. Lastly, a shell-like apparatus envelops the head; containing three different screens and panels. Accompanying this model is a small group of sounds resembling harsh [[subliminal messaging]]; this [[video]]/[[audio]] messaging system explains the military training used by normal transhuman individuals.

This model, in addition to several bizarre sounds of voices in the data files, suggests that this "[[brainwashing]]" memory replacement is an important part of the transhuman operation. The process of erasing memories, inserting Combine propaganda, and eventually, memory replacement results in a soldier incapable of rebelling against the Combine influence, as well as enabling transhumans with no military background training to become part of the Overwatch forces.

This model is seen in Half-Life 2 Episode One during chapter one (Undue Alarm) in the [[List of Combine non-combat technology in Half-Life 2#The Citadel|Combine Citadel]].

===Natural resources===

[[Image:HalfLife2 DryHarbour.jpg|thumb|250px|The Combine have established a portal under Earth's oceans, transporting water to other conquered worlds, resulting in a lower sea level]]

It is evident at several points in the game that the Combine are depleting Earth's [[natural resources]]. One of the official ''Half-Life 2'' descriptions details how [[Gordon Freeman]] must return to "an Earth infested with aliens and being picked to the bone." One of the most noticeable signs is that Earth's [[ocean]] levels have dropped to catastrophically low levels. This can be seen during the coastal chapters ''Highway 17'' and ''Sandtraps'', and the waterways of [[City 17]] in ''Route Kanal'' and ''Water Hazard'', with some remaining water in the latter, but also covered with toxic waste in some places, for unknown reasons. The coastline is littered with boats and ships resting on what was previously the seabed, and there are various docks and piers that are no longer standing in water, but instead jut out of the old seabed. At the beginning of ''Highway 17'', Gordon arrives at a harbor which is now a considerable distance from the water's edge. Indications of the previous sea level can be judged by [[moss]] which had previously gathered on harbour structures at the edge of the water, but which now lie several meters higher than the ground level. It is mentioned in the book ''Raising the Bar'' that this massive, planet-wide water drainage is accomplished through the presence of a giant Combine "drain," actually a portal, which sends the water to other Combine-enslaved planets.  

More generally, parts of the game world, such as [[Ravenholm]], are flooded with parasitic [[headcrab]]s and toxic waste, making them generally inhospitable to human life. Infrastructure is either decaying (as with ''Highway 17'', which is in a state of great disrepair and littered with old rusting cars), or rendered completely non-functional (as with [[Nova Prospekt]], where the traditional prison area is largely derelict and flooded). The wastelands outside of the city show no evidence of agricultural activity. The Fisherman in ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]'' comments that there's no fish left to eat, only [[Carnivorous Leech|leeches]] which devour anyone who steps into the ocean. However, ''Episode 2'' shows that at least some of the ecosystem is still intact further away from the cities.

[[City 17]] itself is being devoured, as Combine walls spread outward from the Citadel, consuming the city's buildings. It is unexplained whether the Combine are purely using this method to destroy the city, or are actually gathering raw materials from the city's structures.

During development of the game, the Combine were to have had a huge industrial facility referred to as the "Air Exchange," which gradually absorbed Earth's air and replaced it with substances harmful to humans, but making it an ideal environment for the Combine master race. It was up to Gordon Freeman to travel to the Combine Air Exchange via a ship called ''The Borealis'', which was captained by a man named Odell. Gordon's actions at the Air Exchange were to trigger the human insurrection against the Combine in City 17, but as the level was dropped, this was instead made to happen due to Gordon's actions at [[Nova Prospekt]]. The Air Exchange level was dropped during development, and does not exist in the official storyline of the game; however at the end of ''Episode 2'', a direct reference is made to the ''Borealis'', the ship that Gordon must next head to save Dr. Mossman. The ship is also said to have some ominous high technology on board, possibly with the ability to release the Earth from Combine control, as heard in a conversation between Eli and Dr. Kleiner. The technology was supposedly created by Aperture Science, the group that set [[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'s events in motion.

==Military==
===Humanoid===
[[Image:Combinesoldier.jpg|150px|thumb|left|A Combine soldier <!--the article shows that there are ranks of these soldiers. So.. what rank is this soldier? Civil Protection??-->]]
The primary military force of the Combine on Earth is the humanoid '''Combine Overwatch''' (referred to by [[Doctor Breen]] as the "Transhuman Arm of the Sector 17 Overwatch"): humans who have been modified into "[[transhuman]]" (or "post-human", as referred to by [[Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Kleiner]]) [[cyborg]]s. They are the most frequently encountered foes throughout ''Half-Life 2''. It is important to note that the Civil Protection foes, unlike soldiers, are not controlled through implanted machinery, but are willing volunteers in the organization, though increases in rank follow dehumanization such as memory replacement. According to a t-shirt available in the Valve online store, humanoid combine have the latin name of ''Homo sapiens combinus''. Which obviously is a joke.[http://store.valvesoftware.com/productpages/apparel/product_HL2EvoShirt.html]

===Synths===
Synths are creatures that, over a course of imposed evolution and adaptation by the Combine, have come to fit a particular niche in the Combine military. Once organic creatures that spread across different worlds, they were enslaved and assimilated into the Combine to become the backbone of their military. The most prominent Synths in Half-Life 2 are Striders, three-legged, gargantuan aliens with powerful pulse guns mounted at the head and a high powered energy cannon on their underbelly. These are the Combine equivalent of an armored heavy tank. Their "little brothers", the Hunters are encountered in Episode Two, are like Striders, only much smaller and use less devastating weaponry.

Various types of Synth have been brought over to Earth by the Combine, but other types of Synth are likely to exist. The total number of different Synths is unknown. It is likely that Synths were the primary forces used by the Combine during the [[Seven Hour War]], as the human-derived Combine units, as well as technology such as hunter-choppers and APCs, would have only started appearing after the Combine's rule on Earth had been established.
