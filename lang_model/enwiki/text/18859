On May 2, 2011, an image purporting to show a dead bin Laden was broadcast on Pakistani television. Though the story was picked up by much of the British press, as well the [[Associated Press]], it was swiftly removed from websites after it was exposed as a fake on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-photo-fake|title=Osama bin Laden corpse photo is fake|author=Amelia Hill|publisher=Guardian|location=London|date=May 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/blogs/battle-rattle/2011/05/02/bin-laden-death-photo-fake|title=Bin Laden death photo: FAKE!|publisher=MilitaryTimes}}</ref>

==Lack of physical evidence==
The primary source of skepticism about the U.S. government's story has been its own refusal to provide any physical evidence to substantiate its claim.  Though the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials, no physical evidence constituting actual proof of his death has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA).<ref name="FOIA1">{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/associated-press-case-releasing-bin-laden-photo/37510/|title=The Associated Press's Case for Releasing the Bin Laden Photo|author=John Hudson|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 10, 2011}}</ref>  Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including [[The Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], [[CBS News]], [[Judicial Watch]], [[Politico]], [[Fox News]], [[Citizens United]], and [[NPR]].<ref name="FOIA2">{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/look-whos-foiaing-bin-laden-death-photo/37493/|title=A Look at Who's FOIAing the Bin Laden Death Photo|author=John Hudson|publisher=The Atlantic Wire|date=May 9, 2011}}</ref>  At the time of filing their FOIA request, The Associated Press said:

On April 26, 2012, a US federal judge decided in the case ''Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Defense, et al'' that the DoD did not need to release any evidence to the public.  [[Judicial Watch]]'s president responded to the ruling by saying:

==Burial at sea==
Doubts about bin Laden's death were fueled by the U.S. military's disposal of his body at sea, though U.S. officials maintained that the burial was necessary because arrangements could not be made with any country to bury bin Laden within 24 hours, as dictated by [[Islamic funeral|Muslim practice]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Muslim practice has not always been followed by the U.S. in the past. For example, the bodies of [[Uday Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], sons of [[Saddam Hussein]], were held for 11 days before being released for burial.<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/02/bin-laden-body-buried-sea|title=Bin Laden's body buried at sea|author=Brian Whitaker|publisher=Guardian|location=London|date=May 2, 2011}}</ref> In that instance, however, several Iraqi cities were reluctant to grant a gravesite for Saddam's sons.<ref name="guardian1"/>

The decision to bury bin Laden at sea was questioned by some [[Islam]]ic scholars and by some [[9/11]] victims and their relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fuse.tv/news/articles/?article=0gePetL1FLfCe |title=Muslims furious about Osama sea burial <U+2013> Daylife |publisher=Fuse.tv |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2011/0503/Osama-bin-Laden-s-burial-at-sea-critics-range-from-9-11-families-to-militants|title=Osama bin Laden's burial at sea: critics range from 9/11 families to militants.|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> Professor Peter Romaniuk of [[John Jay College]] described the burial at sea as a way to forestall further questions. He stated: "Obviously they<U+2019>re going to be under pressure to show a body or produce further evidence, but this was a way of taking that issue off the table."<ref name=autogenerated2 /> A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or "terrorist shrine".<ref name="ref-41">{{cite news | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/05/osama-bin-laden-body-headed-for-burial-at-sea-officials-say.html | title = Osama Bin Laden Body Headed for Burial at Sea, Officials Say | publisher = ABC News | date = May 2, 2011 | accessdate =May 2, 2011 }}</ref>

==Views of individuals and groups==
{{see also|Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden}}

===In Pakistan===
Senior Pakistani officials disseminated the theory that no firefight ever took place, and that whoever the U.S. forces captured, they executed him outside the compound, and took his body away on a helicopter.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1383106/Osama-Bin-Laden-dead-Wife-watched-die-White-House-reveals-WASNT-armed.html Shot dead 'with money sewn into his clothes': Bin Laden was captured alive and then executed, 'claims daughter, 12'].

[[Hamid Gul]], the former head of Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), stated in an interview with [[Cable News Network|CNN]] that he believed bin Laden had died many years ago, and that the official death story given out by the American media was a hoax.<ref name="Gul">{{cite news|url=http://inthearena.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/05/fmr-pakistani-intel-chief-obama-lying/|title=Former Pakistani intel chief: Obama lying|publisher=CNN|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, he thinks the American government knew about bin Laden's death for years, "They must have known that he had died some years ago so they were waiting. They were keeping this story on the ice and they were looking for an appropriate moment and it couldn't be a better moment because President Obama had to fight off his first salvo in his next year's election as he runs for the presidential and for the White House and I think it is a very appropriate time to come out, bring this out of the closet."<ref name="Gul"/>

Yet another scenario was reported in an article in the [[Urdu]] newspaper ''[[Ausaf]]'', which quoted military sources as saying, "Bin Laden has been killed somewhere else. But since the US intends to extend the Afghan war into Pakistan, and accuse Pakistan, and obtain a permit for its military's entry into the country, it has devised the [assassination] scenario."<ref name="Guard">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/05/osama-bin-laden-conspiracy-theories|title=Osama bin Laden death: The conspiracy theories|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first1=Patrick|last1=Kingsley|first2=Sam|last2=Jones|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=May 5, 2011|location=London}}</ref>

Bashir Qureshi, who lives close to the compound where bin Laden was shot and whose windows were blown out in the raid, was dismissive. "Nobody believes it. We've never seen any Arabs around here, he was not here."<ref name="telegraph1">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8489304/Osama-bin-Laden-killed-conspiracy-theories-proliferate-in-wake-of-raid.html|title=Osama bin Laden killed: conspiracy theories proliferate in wake of raid|publisher=Telegraph | location=London|date=May 3, 2011}}</ref>

===In Iran===
A number of Iranians said they believed that bin Laden was working with the U.S. during the entire war on terror. Ismail Kosari, an Iranian MP, said that bin Laden "was just a puppet controlled by the [[Zionist]] regime in order to present a violent image of Islam after the [[September 11 attacks]]", and that his death "reflects the passing of a temporary US pawn, and symbolizes the end of one era and the beginning of another in American policy in the region".<ref name="Iran"/> Another MP, Javad Jahangirzadeh, said he believed that it was the U.S. that had carried out the terrorist attacks, and bin Laden was the main source of help. He stated, "The West has been very pleased with bin Laden's operations in recent years. Now the West was forced to kill him in order to prevent a possible leak of information he had, information more precious than gold."<ref name="Iran">{{cite news |title=Iran<U+2019>s reaction to Osama death ranges from skepticism to conspiracy theories|author= |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/141350/20110504/iran-us-osama-israel.htm|newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref> Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi claimed to have "credible information that Bin Laden died some time ago of a disease."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rt.com/news/osama-dead-raid/|title=Iran can prove Bin Laden was dead long before US raid <U+2013> Iranian minister|publisher=RT|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>

===In Turkey===
Berkan Yashar, a Turkish politician, stated that bin Laden died of natural causes on June 26, 2006 and was buried. The Americans, he claims, dug out bin Laden's body and displayed it, falsely telling the world that he was killed in an assault.<ref>http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/05/19/242057/osama-bin-laden-died-of-natural-causes/</ref>

On [[Russia Today]], radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] claimed that bin Laden had been dead for nearly ten years, and that his body had been kept in liquid nitrogen so that it can be used as a propaganda tool at a future politically expedient time.

The Iranian network [[Press TV]] interviewed [[Webster Tarpley]] and [[Stephen Lendman]], who both doubted the official story of bin Laden's death. Tarpley said he believed bin Laden had been dead for a long time.
