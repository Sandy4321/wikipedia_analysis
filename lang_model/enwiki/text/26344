The '''Basilica of Our Lady of Victory''' is a national [[shrine]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish]] located in [[Lackawanna, New York]]. Due to the multiple [[charities]] of founder [[Father Nelson Baker]], the shrine is a popular [[pilgrimage]] and visitor destination in Lackawanna.

==History==
[[Image:Our Lady of Victory Institutions Sign.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A sign describing the basilica's important status amongst Father Nelson Baker's several charitable institutions of Our Lady of Victory parish.]]
Construction on the Basilica began in 1921 after Father Baker unveiled plans for a shrine paying [[homage]] to the [[Blessed Mother]] before a routine parish council meeting. Because of Baker's influence in the community and well-known charitable reputation across the nation, construction began almost immediately. Baker sent out calls of support for his project, and thousands from across the nation contributed funding both large and small, mostly through a direct-mail fundraising club. The basilica was constructed at a cost of $3.2 million, but the project was completed without going into [[debt]].<ref name="History">{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Our Lady of Victory Basilica & National Shrine|url=http://www.ourladyofvictory.org/Basilica/bashistory.html|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=Our Lady of Victory Institutions, Lackawanna|year=2007|work=Our Lady of Victory Institutions website}}</ref>

By late 1925, construction on the [[sanctuary]] of Our Lady of Victory was complete and the first [[mass]] was held there on [[Christmas]] of that year. On May 25, 1926, a [[consecration]] ceremony took place presided over by Father Baker, [[William Turner (Bishop of Buffalo)|Bishop William Turner]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo|Diocese of Buffalo]], and [[Cardinal Patrick Hayes]]. Thousands of [[priests]], [[nuns]], and believers from across the nation attended the event. Two months later, [[Pope Pius XI]] designated the shrine the honorable title of "Minor Basilica" via an [[apostolic constitution|apostolic]] [[decree]]. Baker was in charge of the Basilica and the parish's various institutions of charity until his death on July 29, 1936.

Throughout the years, the Basilica saw only two changes to its original design. The first came in 1941 during a violent [[lightning]] [[storm]] that caused significant damage to the basilica's original twin towers. Baker's first successor [[Monsignor]] Joseph Maguire, took charge of the efforts to refurbish the structures, replacing the original [[marble]] towers with the lower, enclosed, [[copper]] dome-tipped towers that can be seen on the basilica today. The second change came during the harsh winter of 2001-2002. The roof of the National Shrine was significantly deteriorated, turning the original shiny copper to a greenish hue due to overexposure to the elements (a similar chemical effect as seen on the [[Statue of Liberty]]), hence a new copper roof had to be installed.

In 2001, a celebration of the National Shrine's [[Diamond Jubilee]] and basilica's 75 years in the making was held at the Our Lady of Victory Parish. On May 26, a special mass was followed by a dinner party, at which hundreds of dignitaries, [[clergy]] members, and friends came together to celebrate the Basilica and Father Baker's legacy.

==Relics of Father Baker==
[[Image:Father Baker Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The sarcophagus containing the remains of Father Nelson Baker.]]
In July 1998, through the efforts of Bishop Henry J. Mansell, it was announced that the earthly remains of Father Baker would be moved from the nearby Holy Cross Cemetery to the Basilica. The move was ordered by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] in Rome, to signify a step towards declaring Baker a [[saint]]. On March 11, 1999, Father Baker's [[casket]] was carried by six men who were raised by Baker himself, and placed in a [[sarcophagus]] within the [[Grotto]] Shrine to [[Our Lady of Lourdes]], found on the southern end of the Basilica's [[transept]]. It is estimated that nearly 6,000 people attended the event at the Basilica that day to honor Baker and his accomplishments. The move also helped raise awareness of Baker, his mission, and his legacy across the world.

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The design of the exterior of the basilica was the work of French [[ecclesiastical]] [[architect]], [[Emile Ulrich]]. To fulfill Father Baker's wish for the finest materials and workmanship, Ulrich halted all other projects from his architectural firm in [[Cleveland]] and spent his time personally inspecting artists' work both in the United States and Europe.<ref name="Exterior">{{cite web|title=On-Line Tour of the Our Lady of Victory Basilica & National Shrine - Exterior|url=http://www.ourladyofvictory.org/Basilica/tourex.html|accessdate=2008-11-23|publisher=Our Lady of Victory Institutions, Lackawanna|year=2007|work=Our Lady of Victory Institutions website}}</ref>

The majority of the exterior of the shrine is constructed almost entirely of pure white marble, originally from the Georgia Marble Company of [[Tate]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Throughout the Basilica's interior and parts of the exterior, a  combination of more than 40 different types, colors, and designs of Italian marble can also be found.

====The Great Dome====
[[Image:Great Dome Exterior Detail 2.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A close up of the exterior of the Great Dome.]]
A prominent feature of the Basilica's exterior is the large copper dome. The dome, measuring 165 feet in height, was second in size only to the [[U.S. Capitol]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the time of its completion in 1926. Over the years, the dome's original copper has aged to a green patina. Four copper [[angel]] statues playing [[trumpets]], measuring 18 feet tall, are mounted on the dome.

====The Twin Towers====
The original twin towers of the Basilica, when completed in 1926,  stood at a height of 165 feet (about 16 stories). The [[spire]]s were made completely of marble and had an open design. In 1941, a violent lightning storm caused major damage to both the towers, forcing redesign and refurbishing. The new towers, enclosed and much shorter than the originals, are topped with copper domes, similar to the design of the Basilica's Great Dome.

====The Main Entrance====
[[Image:Exterior Colonnade.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The colonnade that features the figure of Father Baker on the side exterior of the Basilica.]]
Two large [[colonnade]]s extend outward and flank the exterior sides of the shrine at the main entrance. On top of each is a marble sculpture of a group of children overseen by a large angel. On the left colonnade (when facing the Basilica's front), the children are led by a [[nun]]. This figure represents the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]], the order which has staffed the Our Lady of Victory Institutions since 1856. On the right colonnade, the children are led by a priest, Father Baker. This figure of Baker was ordered by Ulrich to honor the priest for his several contributions to the Our Lady of Victory Institutions. Also at the entrance to the Basilica is a domed [[niche (architecture)|niche]] that houses a 12-foot-tall, 16,000 pound (eight tons), statue of Our Lady of Victory, crafted of the finest carerra marble available.

===Interior===
====The Great Dome and Ceiling====
[[Image:Our Lady of Victory Basilica Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of Our Lady of Victory Basilica.]]
The largest work of art is the decoration of the Great Dome, {{convert|80|ft|m}} in diameter, which depicts the [[Assumption of Mary]] and the Blessed Mother's [[Coronation]].  Around the dome's outer edge, the [[12 apostles]] and three [[archangels]] are shown, while an angelic host carries Mary towards heaven. Slightly higher within the dome, Jesus in red robes can been seen awaiting her. At the pinnacle of the dome, {{convert|120|ft|m}} above the basilica floor, depicts a [[Doves as symbols#Peace symbol|white Dove of Peace]] looking down from [[Heaven]] at the basilica.<ref name="Interior">{{cite web|title=On-Line Tour of the Our Lady of Victory Basilica & National Shrine - Interior|url=http://www.ourladyofvictory.org/Basilica/tourin.html|accessdate=2008-11-23|publisher=Our Lady of Victory Institutions, Lackawanna|year=2007|work=Our Lady of Victory Institutions website}}</ref>

From the Great Dome to the choir loft, the [[ceiling]] is covered by five giant [[murals]]. They depict Mary as Queen of Patriarchs, Queen of the Apostles, Queen of the Angels, Queen of the Prophets, and Queen of the Martyrs. The two walls on the Basilica's sides feature huge paintings depicting the [[Slaughter of the Innocents]], the [[Flight into Egypt]], and the [[Birth of Jesus]] at [[Bethlehem]].

====The Main Altar====
[[Image:Main Alter Detail.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Detail of the statue of Our Lady of Victory on the main altar.]]
The main altar features a {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall, {{convert|1600|lb|kg}} statue of Our Lady of Victory.  This was blessed by [[Pope Pius XI]] after being sculpted in Italy. Baker placed a painting of the pope on the altar in return.  

Flanking the altar are four swirled marble columns of rare red marble, reminiscent of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A legend is told about the marble that says a group of Buffalo-born soldiers stumbled upon the unique red marble while in Spain during World War I. Upon seeing it, the soldiers thought immediately of the basilica being built back home by Father Baker, and they went to talk to the Spanish farmer who owned the property the marble was on. After hearing the story of Father Baker, the farmer agreed to donate the "useless rock" on his property. Arrangements were made and the marble was soon sent to Lackawanna to complete the work on the basilica's altar.<ref name="Lackawanna-Basilica">{{cite web|title=The City of Lackawanna Web Site: Our Lady of Victory Basilica & National Shrine|url=http://www.ci.lackawanna.ny.us/basilica.htm|year=2006<U+2013>2007|publisher=City of Lackawanna|work=City of Lackawanna website}}</ref>

The main altar stands under a bright blue dome depicting the [[Holy Spirit]] in brilliant hues. On the ceiling over the altar, an elongated panel represents "Queen of All Saints." Among the saints are [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|St. Elizabeth]], [[St. Anne]], and [[St. Theresa]].<ref name="Interior"/>

====Items of Papal Significance====
Near the altar, at one end of the [[pews]], stands the [[canopeum]], a symbolic shield which remains half open until the Pope visits the basilica and completely opens it. The [[tintinnabulum]], a small gold bell mounted on a pole with a golden frame, stands at the other end, and is used to lead the procession when the Pope says mass within the basilica. These two items, along with the [[Papal Coat of Arms]], which hangs above the [[bronze]] main entrance doors, signify the shrine's Basilica status within the Catholic community. 

====The Stations of the Cross====
[[Image:Stations of the Cross.JPG|thumb|left|120px|One of the 14 lifesize marble Stations of the Cross.]]
The shrine is flanked by the 14 marble [[Stations of the Cross]], which depict [[Jesus]]' final hours before his death.  Rather than being carved from separate blocks of marble and being assembled afterwards, each Station was sculpted from single blocks.  The figures are depicted at life size.  The Italian sculptor, Pepini, spent 14 years on the design and execution.<ref name="Lackawanna-Basilica"/>

The station entitled "Jesus Meets His Afflicted Mother" holds a special place as Father Baker's favorite places in the Basilica.  Baker, in his 80s by the time the Basilica was completed, could be often found leaning on the [[Column|pillar]] closest to this Station, [[meditating]] and saying [[prayers]].<ref name="Interior"/>

====The Organ====
When the original, custom-made [[Wurlitzer organ]] installed the [[choir]] loft had deteriorated beyond repair, a specially-designed 54-rank [[pipe organ]] was installed in its place. Built by the [[Delaware Pipe Organ Co.]] and installed in 1981, the organ has three mahogany pipe towers, each in an eight-foot semicircle, representing the [[Holy Trinity]]. There are 51 pipes in the three towers with the balance of pipes located behind the towers. The pipework is of metal and wood and ranges in length from six inches to 18 feet.

====The Grotto and Father Baker's Remains====
[[Image:Baker Tomb Grotto.jpg|thumb|right|120px|The Grotto Shrine where the remains of Father Nelson Baker were placed in a sarcophagus.]]
Baker's remains are in a sarcophagus within the Grotto Shrine to [[Our Lady of Lourdes]], found on the southern end of the Basilica's [[transept]]. The Grotto is hewn out of black [[lava rock]] from [[Mount Vesuvius]] in Italy.  Baker, who had died in 1936,<ref name="Twilight">{{cite web|title=The Father Baker Story: Twilight|url=http://www.ourladyofvictory.org/FatherBaker/twilight.htm|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=Our Lady of Victory Institutions, Lackawanna|year=2002|work=Our Lady of Victory Institutions website}}</ref> had wanted to find a construction material that was "untouched by humans" to commemorate the [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of the Blessed Mother to [[St. Bernadette]] in [[Lourdes]], France.<ref name="History"/>

====Other Places of Interest====
'''Other Sculptures and Artwork:'''
The interior is decorated with several religious paintings, sculptures, and [[mosaics]] depicting devotion to the Blessed Mother. It is estimated that from 1,500 to 2,500 angels can be found in the basilica in the sculptures and artwork. It was Baker's plan to place an angel in every possible sightline, to remind visitors that although the Basilica is dedicated to Our Lady of Victory, its main purpose is meant primarily for God's praise and glory.<ref name="Interior"/>
[[Image:Father Baker Rooms.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Some of the pictures and memorabilia found in the Father Baker rooms in the basement of the Basilica.]]

'''The Pews and Aisle:'''
The Basilica's [[pews]] are made of rare [[African]] [[mahogany]], and provide seating for more than 1,200 individuals. Similar to the design of [[sports arenas]], the shrine's floor and aisle are gradually sloped, to ensure that visitors have an unobstructed view of the Basilica's main altar. 

'''The Altars:'''
In keeping with the style of architecture the artists had chosen for the Basilica, five unique altars line the rear wall behind the Main Altar. These altars are dedicated to: [[St. Patrick]], [[St. Aloysius]], Mary Immaculate, St. Anne, and [[St. Vincent de Paul]], whose life work with the poor and needy served as [[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] for Father Baker's own life.

'''The Baptistery:'''
Located adjacent to the Main Altar, the Bapistery features a marble baptismal font as well as dozens of wall and ceiling paintings of with religious symbols and peoples.

'''The Father Baker Museum:'''
During late 2009, construction went underway to create a small museum about Father Baker's life and the history of the Our Lady of Victory Institutions. It is located in the Basilica's basement, where the chapel and Father Baker Rooms were formerly located. After going through the museum, the exit goes out and through the remodeled gift shop. A number of photos, official documents, vintage newspapers, and Baker's actual belongings are on display for visitors to see. Items such as Father Baker's desk, books, clothing, and furniture can be found throughout the museum. Also in the museum are cases of photos, information, and [[memorabilia]] from the Our Lady of Victory Institutions, such as the Infant Home, [[Orphanage]], Protectory, and the Basilica itself.
