{{History of Haiti}}

The '''[[United States]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] of [[Haiti]]''' began on July 28, 1915, when 330 [[United States Marine Corp|US Marines]] landed at [[Port-au-Prince]] on the authority of then President of the United States [[Woodrow Wilson]] to "protect American and foreign" interests. It ended on August 1, 1934, after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of U.S. Marines departed on August 15, 1934 after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde.

==Causes==
Between 1911 and 1915, a series of political assassinations and forced exiles saw the presidency of Haiti change six times.<ref>Robert Heinl, Pg. 791</ref> Various revolutionary armies carried out this series of coups. Each was formed by ''cacos'', or peasant brigands from the mountains of the north, along the porous [[Dominican republic|Dominican]] border, who were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder.  

The United States was particularly apprehensive about the role the small [[Germany|German]] community in Haiti, which numbered approximately 200 in 1910, played, wielding a disproportionately high amount of economic power.<ref name=state>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/wwi/88275.htm of Haiti, 1915-34]</ref> German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce, owned and operated utilities in Cap Haitien and [[Port-au-Prince]], the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and owned a railroad serving the Plaine de Cul-du-Sac.<ref>Schmidt, 35.</ref> 

The German community proved more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of white foreigners, including the more numerous French. Some Germans married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, thus bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation's innumerable revolutions, floating loans at high interest rates to competing political factions.<ref>Schmidt, 35.</ref>

In an effort to limit German influence, in 1910-11 the State Department backed a consortium of American investors, assembled by the [[Citibank|National City Bank of New York]], in acquiring control of the ''Banque National d'Ha<U+00EF>ti'', the nation's only commercial bank and the government treasury.<ref>Douglas, Paul H. from Occupied Haiti, ed. Emily Greene Balch (New York, 1972), 15-52  reprinted in: Money Doctors, Foreign Debts, and Economic Reforms in [[Latin America]]. [[Wilmington, Delaware]]: Edited by Paul W. Drake, 1994.</ref>

In February 1915, [[Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] established a dictatorship, but in July, facing a new revolt, he massacred 167 political prisoners, all of whom were from elite families. Sam was then lynched by a mob in Port-au-Prince.<ref>Millett, Allan Reed. ''Semper fidelis: the history of the United States Marine Corps'', pg. 185.</ref>

It is alleged that a popular uprising against Sam threatened American business interests in the country (such as [[Haitian American Sugar Company|HASCO]]). Because of these competing interests and the possibility of the ''cacos''-supported anti-American [[Rosalvo Bobo]] emerging as the next President of Haiti, the American government decided to act quickly to preserve their economic dominance over Haiti.<ref>[[#refWeinsteinSegal1984|Weinstein, Segal 1984]], p.28.</ref> 

[[President of the United States|American President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent 330 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] to [[Port-au-Prince]] on July 28, 1915. The specific order from the [[Secretary of the Navy]] to the invasion commander, [[Admiral]] William Deville Bundy, was to "protect American and foreign" interests. However, to avoid public criticism the occupation was labeled as a mission to <U+201C>re-establish peace and order...[and] has nothing to do with any diplomatic negotiations of the past or the future<U+201D> as disclosed by Rear Admiral Caperton.<ref>[[#refWeston1972|Weston 1972]], p.217.</ref>

On November 17, 1915, U.S. Marines captured [[Fort Riviere]], a stronghold of the Cacos rebels.

The Haitian government had been receiving large loans from both American and French banks over the past few decades and was growing increasingly incapable in fulfilling their debt repayment. If an anti-American government prevailed under the leadership of Rosalvo Bobo, there would be no promise of any debt repayment, and the refusal of American investments would have been assured. Within six weeks of the occupation, representatives from the United States controlled Haitian [[customs]] houses and administrative institutions such as banks and the national treasury. Through American manipulation, 40% of the national income was used to alleviate the debt repayment to both American and French banks.<ref>[[#WeinsteinSegal1984|Weinstein, Segal 1984]], p.29.</ref>Despite the large sums due to overseas banks, this economic decision ignored the interests of the majority of the Haitian population and froze the economic growth the country needed. For the next nineteen years, advisers of the United States governed the country, enforced by the United States Marine Corps.<ref name=state/>

==Government and opposition==

Representatives from the United States wielded [[veto power]] over all governmental decisions in Haiti, and Marine Corps commanders served as administrators in the [[provinces]]. Local institutions, however, continued to be run by Haitians, as was required under policies put in place during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The US administration dismantled the constitutional system, reinstituted virtual slavery for building roads, and established the National Guards that ran the country by violence after the Marines left.<ref name = "UOH">Paul Farmer, ''The Uses of Haiti'' (Common Courage Press: 1994) </ref>  It also made massive improvements to infrastructure: 1700&nbsp;km of roads were made usable; 189 bridges were built; many irrigation canals were rehabilitated hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. 

Opposition to the Occupation began immediately after the Marines entered Haiti in 1915. The rebels (called "cacos" by the U.S. Marines) vehemently tried to resist American control of Haiti. In response, the Haitian and American governments began a vigorous campaign to disband the rebel armies. Perhaps the best-known account of this skirmishing came from Marine Major [[Smedley Butler]], awarded a [[Medal of Honor]] for his exploits, and went on to serve as commanding officer of the Haitian [[Gendarmerie]]. (He later expressed his disapproval of the U.S. [[offensive (military)|intervention]] in his book ''[[War Is a Racket]]''.)

[[Philippe Sudr<U+00E9> Dartiguenave]], the [[mulatto]] president of the Senate, <!--was married to John O'Callagan --> agreed to accept the presidency of Haiti after several other candidates had refused on principle.  In 1917, President Dartiguenave dissolved the legislature after its members refused to approve a [[constitution]] written by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (then [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]])<ref>Roosevelt assereted his authorship of the Haitian Constitution in several speeches during his [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 campaign]] for Vice President - which was at best a politically awkward overstatement and caused some controversy in the campaign. ([[Arthur Schlesinger]], ''The Crisis of the Old Order'', 364, citing 1920 Roosevelt Papers for speeches in Spokane, San Francisco, and Centralia.)</ref>
However, a [[referendum]] subsequently approved the new constitution in 1918 (by a vote of 98,225 to 768). It was a generally a [[Liberalism|liberal]] document. The constitution allowed foreigners to purchase land. [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] had forbidden land ownership by foreigners, and since 1804, some Haitians had viewed foreign ownership as [[anathema]].<ref name=onwar>[http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/uniform/ushaiti1918.htm  U.S. Haiti Rebellion 1918]</ref>

The occupation of Haiti continued after [[World War I]], despite the embarrassment that it caused Woodrow Wilson at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] and the scrutiny of a congressional inquiry in 1922. 

In 1922, Dartiguenave was replaced by [[Louis Borno]], who ruled without a legislature until 1930. That same year, General [[John H. Russell, Jr.]] was appointed High Commissioner. The Borno-Russel dictatorship oversaw the expansion of the economy, building over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of road, establishing an automatic telephone exchange, modernizing the nation's port facilities, and establishing a public health service. [[Sisal]] was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports.<ref>Heinl, Pg. 454-455</ref> 

However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture met with limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed as seasonal workers in the more-established sugar industries of [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. An estimated 30,000-40,000 Haitian laborers, known as ''braceros,'' went annually to the [[Oriente|Oriente Province]] of [[Cuba]] between 1913 and 1931.<ref>Bridget Woodling, Richard Moseley-Williams ''Needed but unwanted: Haitian Immigrants and their Descendants in the Dominican Republict'' (Catholic Institute for International Relations: London, 2004) Pg. 24</ref> Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty. At the forefront of opposition among the educated elite was ''L'Union Patriotique,'' which established ties with opponents of the occupation in the U.S. itself, in particular the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]].<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=9760 Haiti, Haitians hi, and Black America]</ref>

The [[Great Depression]] decimated the prices of Haiti's exports, and destroyed the tenuous gains of the previous decade. In December 1929, Marines in [[Les Cayes]] killed ten Haitian peasants during a march to protest local economic conditions.<ref name=onwar/> This led [[Herbert Hoover]] to appoint two commissions, including one headed by a former U.S. governor of the [[Philippines]] [[William Cameron Forbes]], which criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority in the government and constabulary, now known as the ''Garde d'Ha<U+00EF>ti''.

==Transition to fully Haitian government==

In 1930, [[St<U+00E9>nio Vincent]], a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected President. 

By 1930, President [[Herbert Hoover]] had become concerned about the effects of the occupation, particularly after the December 1929 incident in [[Les Cayes]]. Hoover appointed two commissions to study the situation. A former governor general of the [[Philippines]], [[William Cameron Forbes]], headed the more prominent of the two. 

The Forbes Commission praised the material improvements that the U.S. administration had wrought, but it criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of real authority in the government and the [[constabulary]], which had come to be known as the Garde d'Ha<U+00EF>ti. In more general terms, the commission further asserted that "the social forces that created [instability] still remain &mdash; poverty, ignorance, and the lack of a tradition or desire for orderly free government."<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/haiti19.htm Occupation of Haiti 1915-34] Globalsecurity.org.</ref>

The Hoover administration did not fully implement the recommendations of the Forbes Commission; but United States withdrawal was under way by 1932, when Hoover lost the presidency to Franklin Roosevelt, the presumed author of the most recent Haitian constitution and the proponent of "[[Good Neighbor policy]]". On a visit to [[Cap-Ha<U+00EF>tien]] in July 1934, Roosevelt reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of U.S. Marines departed on August 15, 1934 after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde. <ref name="Haite1934">p 223 - {{cite book | last = Benjamin Beede | authorlink = | title = The War of 1898 and U.S. Interventions, 1898-1934: An Encyclopedia|edition= May 1, 1994|pages= 784 | publisher = Routledge; 1 edition| isbn= 0824056248|language=ENGLISH }}<BR>''The Haitian and U.S. governments reached a mutually satisfactory agreement in the Executive Accord of 7 Aug 1933, and on 15 August, the last marines departed.''</ref>
The U.S. retained influence on Haiti's external finances until 1947.<ref>Schmidt, Hans.  ''The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915-1934'' New Brunswick:  Rutgers University Press, 1995.  (232)</ref>

==Effects of the occupation on Haiti==
The occupation by the United States had several significant effects on Haiti. An early period of unrest culminated in a 1918 [[rebellion]] by up to 40,000 former cacos and other disgruntled people. The scale of the uprising overwhelmed the Gendarmerie, but Marine reinforcements helped put down the revolt at an estimated cost of 2,000 Haitian lives.<ref name=onwar/>

The occupation greatly improved some of Haiti's [[infrastructure]]<ref name=state/> and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. Infrastructure improvements were particularly impressive: 1700 km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port au-Prince became the first city of Latin America to have phone service available with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.<ref>Heinl, Pg. 454-455</ref>

When it came to living conditions, the Americans inhabited the neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince in houses that the majority of Haitians would only dream of. Consequently the neighborhood in which the Americans lived was called the <U+201C>millionaire's row.<U+201D><ref>[[#refSchmidt1995|Schmidt 1995]], p.152.</ref> Hans Schmidt accounted an officer's opinion on the matter of segregation: <U+201C>I can't see why they wouldn't have a better time with their crowd, just as I do with mine."<ref>[[#refSchmidt1995|Schmidt 1995]], p.137-38.</ref>American intolerance provoked indignation and resentment &mdash; and eventually a racial pride that was reflected in the work of a new generation of Haitian historians, [[ethnologist]]s, writers, artists, and others, many of whom later became active in politics and government. The mulatto elite managed to dominate the country's [[bureaucracy]] and to strengthen its role in national affairs.

The education system was re-designed from the ground up; however, this involved the destruction of the existing system of "[[liberal arts]]" education inherited (and adapted) from the French. Due to its emphasis on [[vocational training]], the American system that replaced the French was despised by the elite.<ref>Schmidt, p. 183.</ref>

All three rulers during the occupation came from the country's small [[mulatto]] minority. At the same time, many in the growing black professional classes departed from the traditional veneration of Haiti's French cultural heritage and emphasized the nation's African roots.<ref>Schmidt, p. 23.</ref> Among these were ethnologist [[Jean Price-Mars]] and the journal ''Les Griots,'' edited by Dr. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Duvalier]].
