'''Women in early modern Scotland''', between the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] of the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of [[Industrial Revolution in Scotland|industrialisation]] in the mid-eighteenth century, were part of a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, though the enforcement of this social order was not absolute in all aspects. Women retained their family surnames at marriage and did not join their husband's kin groups. In higher social ranks, marriages were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations in which women as matchmakers or mothers could play a major part. Women were a major part of the workforce, with many unmarried women acting as farm servants and married women playing a part in all the major agricultural tasks, particularly during harvest. Widows could be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading, but many at the bottom of society lived a marginal existence.

Women had limited access to formal education and girls benefited less than boys from the expansion of the [[Parochial school|parish school]] system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements out side of the established [[kirk]]. Women had very little legal status at the beginning of the period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.

Early modern Scotland was a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, in which men had total authority over women.<ref name=Dawson2007pp62-3>J. E. A.

Evidence from towns indicates that around one in five households were headed by women, often continuing an existing business interest.<ref>M.

Brown, ''Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from Reformation to Revolution'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-7486-1299-8, p. 73.</ref>

In politics the theory of patriarchy was complicated by regencies led by [[Margaret Tudor]] and [[Mary of Guise]] and by the advent of a regnant queen in [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] from 1561. Concerns over this threat to male authority were exemplified by [[John Knox]]'s ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women]]'' (1558), which advocated the deposition of all reigning queens. Most of the political nation took a pragmatic view of the situation, accepting Mary as queen, but the strains that this paradox created may have played a part in the later difficulties of the reign.<ref name=Dawson2007pp243>Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed'', p. 243.</ref> How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. Scottish women in this period had something of a reputation among foreign observers for being forthright individuals, with the Spanish ambassador to the court of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] noting that they were "absolute mistresses of their houses and even their husbands".<ref name=Ewen2012p274/>

==Family and marriage==
{{Main|Family in early modern Scotland}}
Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately [[cognatic]] (derived through both males and females), in Scotland kinship was [[agnatic]], with members of a group sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women retained their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship.<ref name=Wormald1991pp29-35>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp.&nbsp;29<U+2013>35.</ref> Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills that would allow them to establish a household.<ref> Ewen, "The early modern family", p. 271.</ref> Normally marriage followed [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]], a period of betrothal, which in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate.<ref name=Ewen2012p272>Ewen, "The early modern family", p. 272.</ref>

[[File:SpeedScottishWomen2.jpg|thumb|Details from [[John Speed]]'s map of Scotland in the version published in the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], showing Lowland and Highland women]]
Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher ([[dowry]]). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as [[matchmakers]], finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a [[papal dispensation]], which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such.<ref name=Dawson2007pp62-3/> Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]], divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion. Scotland was one of the first countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.<ref name=Ewen2012p273>Ewen, "The early modern family", p. 273.</ref>

==Work==
{{Main|Economy of Scotland in the early modern era}}
Women acted as an important part of the workforce. In addition to the domestic tasks carried out by wives and female servants, many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the ''bandwin''. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up [[warp (weaving)|warp]]s for men to weave. In the Highlands they may have been even more significant as there is evidence that many men considered agricultural work to be beneath their status and in places they may have formed the majority of the rural workforce.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/> There were roles that were the preserve of women alone, including as [[midwives]] and [[wet-nurse]]s.<ref>Ewen, "The early modern family", p. 277.</ref> There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8>R.

By the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh had schools for girls, sometimes described as "sewing schools", and probably taught by lay women or nuns.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30>P. J.

In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the [[catechism]] and even to be able to independently read the Bible, but most commentators, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. In the lower ranks of society, they benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys, often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent, from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth centuries and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men.<ref>R. A.

==Religion==
{{See also|Scottish Reformation|Scottish religion in the seventeenth century}}
Historian Katharine Glover argues that women had less means of public participation than men and that as a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.<ref name=Glover2011p135>K. Glover, ''Elite Women and Polite Society in Eighteenth-Century Scotland'' (Boydell Press, 2011), ISBN 1-84383-681-5, p. 135.</ref>

The upheavals of the seventeenth century saw women autonomously participating in radical religion.<ref name=Glover2011p135/> The most prominent examples were the women who threw their [[cuttie-stool]]s at the dean who was reading the new "English" service book in St. Giles Cathedral in 1637, precipitating the [[Bishop's Wars]] (1639-40), between the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Covenanters]] and the king, who favoured an [[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] structure in the church, similar to that in England. They were later said to have been led by Edinburgh woman [[Jenny Geddes]].<ref>M. Bennett, ''The Civil Wars Experienced: Britain and Ireland, 1638<U+2013>1661'' (London: Routledge, 2005), ISBN 1-134-72454-3, p. 2.</ref> According to R. A. Houston, women probably had more freedom of expression and control over their spiritual destiny in groups outside the established church such the [[Quakers]], who had a presence in the country from the mid-seventeenth century.<ref>R. A. Houston, "Women in the economy and society in Scotland" in R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500<U+2013>1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), ISBN 0-521-89167-1, p. 137.</ref> The principle of male authority could be challenged when women chose different religious leaders from their husbands and fathers.<ref name=Glover2011p135/> Among the [[Cameronian]]s, who broke away from the kirk when episcopalianism was re-established at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]] in 1660, several reports indicate that women could preach and excommunicate, but not baptise. Several women are known to have been executed for their part in the movement.<ref>R. L.

At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given.<ref name=Ewen2012p273/> Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order.<ref name=Ewen2012p274> E.

Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), ISBN 0-19-956369-1, p. 274.</ref> The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/> As a result a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.<ref name=Ewen2012p275>Ewen, "The early modern family", p. 275.</ref>

In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/> Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offenses including [[Common scold|scolding]] and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal.<ref>A.-M. Kilday, ''Women and Violent Crime in Enlightenment Scotland'' (London: Boydell & Brewer, 2007), ISBN 0-86193-287-0, p. 19.</ref> Through the 1640s there were independent commissions set up to try women for child murder and, after pressure from the kirk, a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman who concealed a pregnancy and birth and whose child later died.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp86-8/> In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the [[Witchcraft Act 1563]], similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself and consulting with witches capital crimes.<ref name=Edwards2010p32>K. A. Edwards, "Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart Scotland", in K. Cartwright, ''A Companion to Tudor Literature Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture'' (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), ISBN 1-4051-5477-2, p. 32.</ref> Between the passing of the act and its repeal in 1736, an estimated 6,000 persons were tried for witchcraft in Scotland.<ref name=Edwards2010p32/> Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women.<ref name=Brown2012p81>S.

Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), ISBN 0-19-956369-1, p. 81.</ref> Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Many of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress<ref name=Wormald991pp168-9>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp.&nbsp;168<U+2013>9.</ref> and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused.<ref>L.

Goodare, ed., ''The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), ISBN 0-7190-6024-9, p. 75.</ref> Changing attitudes to women, particularly in the reformed kirk, which may have perceived women as more of a moral threat, have also been noted.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90>R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603<U+2013>1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), ISBN 0-7486-0233-X, pp.&nbsp;88<U+2013>9.</ref> The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.<ref name=Mitchison1983pp88-90/>
