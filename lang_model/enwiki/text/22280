'''Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk''' ([[Mustafa_Kemal_Atat<U+00FC>rk's_personal_life#Birth_date|indeterminate]] - 1881&ndash;10 November 1938) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] army officer, revolutionary [[statesman]], and [[Father of the Nation|founder of the]] [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] as well as its [[List of Presidents of Turkey|first President]]. 

Atat<U+00FC>rk became known as an extremely capable military officer during [[World War I]].<ref name=zurcher142>Z<U+00FC>rcher, ''Turkey : a modern history'', 142</ref> Following the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]], he led the [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish national movement]] in the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Having established a provisional government in [[Ankara]], he defeated the forces sent by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. His successful military campaigns led to the liberation of the country and to the establishment of Turkey. During his presidency, Atat<U+00FC>rk embarked upon a program of political, economic, and cultural [[reform movement|reforms]]. An admirer of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], he sought to transform the former Ottoman Empire into a [[Modernity|modern]], [[Politics of Turkey|democratic]], and [[secularism in Turkey|secular]] [[nation-state]]. The principles of [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's reforms]], upon which modern Turkey was established, are referred to as [[Kemalism]].

==Early life==
{{Main|Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk's personal life}}

Born as ''Mustafa'', his second name ''Kemal'' (meaning ''Perfection'' or ''Maturity'') was given to him by his mathematics teacher in recognition of his academic excellence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=300&Itemid=317 |title=Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk |publisher=Turkish Embassy website |accessdate=2007-08-07}}</ref> In his early years, his mother encouraged Mustafa to attend a religious school, something he did reluctantly and only briefly. Later, he attended <U+015E>emsi Efendi school (a private school with a more secular curriculum) at the direction of his father. His parents wanted him to have education in a trade, but without consulting them, Atat<U+00FC>rk took an entrance exam for a military junior high school in [[Thessaloniki]] (in Turkish: Selanik -Ottoman city back then) in 1893. In 1896, he enrolled into a military high school in the Ottoman city of [[Bitola|Manast<U+0131>r]] (modern [[Bitola]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]]). In 1899, he enrolled at the War College in [[Istanbul]] and graduated in 1902. He later graduated from the War Academy on 11 January 1905.

==Military career==
{{Main|Military career of Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk}}
Following graduation, he was assigned to [[Damascus]] as a [[lieutenant]]. He joined a small secret revolutionary society of reformist officers called [[Vatan ve H<U+00FC>rriyet]] ("Motherland and Liberty"). In 1907, he was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] and assigned to [[Manast<U+0131>r]]. He joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP, 'Young Turks'). However, in later years he became known for his opposition to, and frequent criticism of, policies pursued by the CUP leadership. In 1908, he played a role in the [[Young Turk Revolution]] which seized power from [[Abd<U+00FC>lhamid II]]. In 1910, he took part in the Picardie army maneuvers in [[France]]. In 1911, he worked at the Ministry of War for a short time. Later in 1911, he was posted to the Ottoman province of Trablusgarp (present-day [[Libya]]) to fight in the [[Italo-Turkish War]]. He returned to the capital in October 1912 following the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]]. During the [[First Balkan War]], he fought against the [[Bulgaria]]n army at Gallipoli and Bolay<U+0131>r on the coast of [[Thrace]]. In 1913, he was appointed military attach<U+00E9> to [[Sofia]] and promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in 1914.

[[Image:GMK Gallipoli.jpg|thumb|left|Mustafa Kemal in [[Gallipoli]] with his soldiers, 1915]]
In 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered [[European theatre of World War I|European]] and [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatres]] of [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]]. Mustafa Kemal was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19<sup>th</sup> Division attached to the [[Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)|Fifth Army]] during the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]]. Mustafa Kemal became the outstanding front-line commander after correctly anticipating where the Allies would attack and holding his position until they retreated. Following the Battle of Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal served in [[Edirne]] until 14 January 1916. He was then assigned to the command of the XVI Corps of the [[Second Army (Ottoman Empire)|Second Army]] and sent to the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. The massive Russian offensive had reached the Anatolian key cities. On 7 August, Mustafa Kemal rallied his troops and mounted a counteroffensive.<ref name=lengyel68>Lengyel, ''They called him Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 68</ref> Two of his divisions captured not only [[Battle of Bitlis|Bitlis]] but the equally important town of [[Mu<U+015F>]], greatly upsetting the calculations of the Russian Command.<ref name=kinross100> Kinross, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 100</ref> On 7 March 1917, Mustafa Kemal was appointed from the command of the XVI Corps to the overall command of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Army. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] erupted and the Caucasus front of the [[Russian Caucasus Army|Czar's armies]] disintegrated.<ref name=lengyel68/> Mustafa Kemal had already left the region and was assigned to the command of the 7<sup>th</sup> Army at the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]. He returned to [[Aleppo]] on 28 August 1918, and resumed command. Mustafa Kemal retreated towards Jordan to establish a stronger defensive line against the British forces that won against the German commander [[Liman von Sanders]]' troops at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. Mustafa Kemal was appointed to the command of Thunder Groups Command ({{lang-tr|Y<U+0131>ld<U+0131>r<U+0131>m Ordular<U+0131> Gurubu}}), replacing Liman von Sanders. Mustafa Kemal's position became the base line for the [[Armistice of Mudros]].

Kemal's last active service in the Ottoman Army was organizing the return of the troops who were left behind the south of his line. Mustafa Kemal returned to an [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]), the Ottoman capital, on 13 November 1918. Along the established lines of [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[France|French]] and [[Greece|Greek]] forces began to occupy Anatolia. The [[occupation of Constantinople]] along with the [[occupation of <U+0130>zmir]] mobilized the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]].<ref>Mustafa Kemal Pasha's speech on his arrival in Ankara in November 1919</ref>

==War of Independence==

Mustafa Kemal's active participation in the national resistance movement began with his assignment as a General Inspector to oversee the demobilization of remaining Ottoman military units and nationalist organizations. On 19 May 1919, he reached [[Samsun]]. His first goal was the [[Establishment of the Turkish national movement|establishment of an organized national resistance movement]] against the occupying forces. In June 1919, he and his close friends declared that the [[Amasya Circular|independence of the country]] was in danger. He resigned from the Ottoman Army on 8 July and the Ottoman government issued a warrant for his arrest. Later, he was condemned to death.

Mustafa Kemal called for a national election to establish a new Turkish Parliament that would have its seat in [[Ankara]].<ref name=feroz50>Ahmad, ''The Making of Modern Turkey'', 50</ref> On 12 February 1920, the last Ottoman Parliament gathered in the capital. This parliament was dissolved by British forces after it declared the [[Misak-<U+0131> Milli]] ("National Pact"). Mustafa Kemal used this opportunity to establish the "[[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]]" (GNA). On 23 April 1920, the GNA opened with Mustafa Kemal as [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Turkey|the speaker]]. On 10 August 1920, the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] signed the [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres]]. It finalized the plans for the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], including the regions that Turkish nationals viewed as their heartland. Mustafa Kemal insisted on complete independence and the safeguarding of the interests of the Turkish majority on Turkish soil. He persuaded the GNA to gather a National Army. The Army faced the Allied occupation forces and fought on three fronts: in the [[Franco-Turkish War|Franco-Turkish]], the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish]] and the [[Turkish-Armenian War|Turkish-Armenian]] wars. After a series of initial battles during the Greco-Turkish war, the Greek army advanced as far as the [[Sakarya River]], just eighty kilometers west of the GNA. On 5 August 1921, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to [[Commander in chief]] of the forces by GNA.<ref name="AA">{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/tarihce_en/ |title=A short history of AA |accessdate=2008-01-01|author=editorial staff |publisher=Anadolu Ajans<U+0131> Genel M<U+00FC>d<U+00FC>rl<U+00FC><U+011F><U+00FC> |quote=''Ikdam'' newspaper dated 9 August 1921, reproducing the dispatches of AA dated 5 August and 6th, 1921, announced that Mustafa Kemal Pasha was promoted to ''Chief Commander''}}</ref> The ensuing [[Battle of Sakarya]] was fought from 23 August to 13 September 1921 and ended with the defeat of the Greeks. The Allies, ignoring the extent of Kemal's successes, hoped to impose a modified version of the [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres]] as a peace settlement on Ankara, but the proposal was rejected. In August 1922, Kemal launched an all-out attack on the Greek lines at [[Afyonkarahisar]], the [[Battle of Dumlup<U+0131>nar]] and finally the Turkish forces regained control of [[Smyrna]] (modern day [[Izmir]]) on September 9, 1922.<ref>Greco-Turkish wars, Britannica CD 99</ref> On September 10 1922, Mustafa Kemal sent a telegram to the [[League of Nations]] saying that on account of the excited spirit of the Turkish population, the [[Ankara]] Government would not be responsible for massacres.<ref>James, Edwin L. "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DEED81039EF3ABC4952DFBF668389639EDE  Kemal Won't Insure Against Massacres]," ''[[New York Times]]'', [[September 11]], [[1922]].</ref>

The [[Conference of Lausanne]] began on 21 November 1922. Turkish representative [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty,<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 365</ref> major matters regarding the control of Turkish finances, the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulations]], the [[Turkish Straits]], justice, and the like. On 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed. The final outcome of the independence war came with the proclamation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923.

==Presidency==
:''For conceptual analysis, see [[Kemalist ideology]] and [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms]]''
[[Image:AtaturkwithMembersofParliament.jpg|thumb|In 1930 leaving the [[Turkish Parliament|parliament]] after the 7th year celebration meeting]]
With the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, efforts to modernise the country started. The institutions and constitutions of Western states such as France, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland were analyzed and adapted according to the needs and characteristics of the Turkish nation. Highlighting the public's lack of knowledge regarding Kemal's intentions, the public cheered: "We are returning to the days of the [[The first four Sunni Caliphs and the Sunnah|first caliphs]]".<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 394</ref> In order to establish [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms|reforms]], Mustafa Kemal placed [[Fevzi <U+00C7>akmak]], [[Kaz<U+0131>m <U+00D6>zalp]] and [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] in important political positions. Mustafa Kemal capitalized on his reputation as an efficient military leader and spent the following years, up until his death in 1938, instituting wide-ranging and progressive political, economic, and social reforms. In doing so, he transformed Turkish society from perceiving itself as Muslim subjects of a vast Empire into citizens of a modern, democratic, and secular nation-state.

===Domestic policies===
A basic political principle for Kemal was the complete independence of the country.<ref name=mango367>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 367</ref> He clarified his position:{{Quote|...by complete independence, we mean of course complete economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural independence and freedom in all matters. Being deprived of independence in any of these is equivalent to the nation and country being deprived of all its independence."<ref>Gerd Nonneman, Analyzing Middle East foreign policies and the relationship with Europe, Published 2005 Routledge, p. 204 ISBN 0714684279</ref>|Mustafa Kemal}} He led wide-ranging reforms in social, cultural, and economical aspects. As a result, the new Republic's backbone of legislative, judicial, and economic structures was put in place with these reforms.

Mustafa Kemal created a banner to mark the changes between the old Ottoman and the new Republican rule. Each change was symbolized as an arrow in this banner. The new citizens of the Republic, who had been subjects of the Ottoman Empire only a few years ago, carried this banner to remind them of the major concepts of this new establishment. This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the "Six Arrows" or [[Kemalist ideology]]. Kemalist ideology is based on Mustafa Kemal's conception of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[pragmatism]].<ref>Webster, ''The Turkey of Atat<U+00FC>rk: social process in the Turkish reformation'', 245</ref> The fundamentals of nationalism, populism and etatism were all defined under the Six Arrows. These fundamentals were not new in world politics or, indeed, among the elites of Turkey. What made them unique was that these interrelated fundamentals were formulated specifically for Turkey's needs. A good example is the definition and application of secularism; the Kemalist secular state significantly differed from predominantly Christian states.

====Emergence of the state, 1923<U+2013>1924====
[[Image:Mustafa Kemal golden scoop political caricature of single party system.png|thumb|A [[political satire]] from the [[Single-party period of Republic of Turkey|single-party period]] depicting Mustafa Kemal, the leader of [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|RPP]], choosing the party candidates for the [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]. In the [[single-party state]], the candidates had only one party's (RPP) list to join.]]
Mustafa Kemal's private journal entries dated before the establishment of the republic in 1923 show that he believed in the importance of the sovereignty of the people. In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Istanbul and its Ottoman heritage.<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 391<U+2013>392</ref> For instance, Ankara became the country's new capital. It was a provincial town deep in Anatolia that turned into the center of the independence movement. He wanted a "direct government by the Assembly"<ref name="Mango, Atat<U+00FC>rk, 362">Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 362</ref> and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.<ref name="Mango, Atat<U+00FC>rk, 362"/> However, in the following years, he took the position that the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that "direct government by the Assembly" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries regularly faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of relatively new ideologies such as [[communism]] and [[fascism]]. Mustafa Kemal saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.<ref>Landau, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252</ref> He prevented the spread of [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy.<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 501</ref> Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition, others believed it was a necessary means to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The heart of the new republic was the GNA. The GNA was established during the Turkish War of Independence by Mustafa Kemal.<ref name="single">Ko<U+00E7>ak, Cemil (2005) 'Parliament Membership during the Single-Party System in Turkey (1925-1945)', European Journal of Turkish Studies</ref> The elections were free and an egalitarian electoral system that was based on a general ballot was used.<ref name="single"/> The role of deputies at the GNA was to be the voice of Turkish society by expressing its political views and preferences. It had the right to select and control both the government and the Prime Minister. Initially, it also acted as a legislative power, controlled the executive and, if necessary, acted as an organ of scrutiny under the [[Turkish Constitution of 1921]].<ref name="single" /> But the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924]] set a loose [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislative]] and the [[executive (government)|executive]] organs of the state, whereas the separation of these two within the [[judiciary]] system was a strict one. Mustafa Kemal, then the President, occupied a powerful position in this political system.

The single-party regime was established de facto in 1925 after the adoption of the 1924 constitution. The only political party of the GNA was the "Peoples Party" that was founded by Mustafa Kemal in the initial years of the independence war. On 9 September 1923 it was renamed as the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (Turkish "Cumhuriyeti Halk Partis<U+0131>").

====Civic independence and the Caliphate, 1924<U+2013>1925====
[[Image:Ataturk-1924-Bursa-public.jpg|thumb|In 1924 during the [[Bursa]] speech.]]
Abolition of the [[Caliphate]] was an important dimension in Mustafa Kemal's drive to reform the political system and to promote the national sovereignty. The Caliphate was the core political concept of [[Sunni Islam]], by the consensus of the Muslim majority in the early centuries.<ref> John O. Voll: Professor of Islamic history at [[Georgetown University]] http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=13296</ref> Abolishing the [[sultanate]] was easier because the survival of the Caliphate at the time satisfied the partisans of the sultanate. This produced a two-headed system with the new republic on one side and an Islamic form of government with the Caliph on the other side. Kemal and <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC> worried that "it nourished the expectations that the sovereign would return under the guise of Caliph...<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 403</ref>" Caliph [[Abd<U+00FC>lmecid II]] was elected after the abolishment of the sultanate (1922). The Caliph had his own personal treasury and also had a personal service that included military personnel; Mustafa Kemal said that there was no "religious" or "political" justification for this. He believed that Caliph Abd<U+00FC>lmecid II was following in the steps of the sultans in domestic and foreign affairs: accepting and responding to foreign representatives and reserve officers, and participating in official ceremonies and celebrations.<ref name="Mango, Atat<U+00FC>rk, 401">Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 401</ref> He wanted to integrate the powers of the [[Caliphate]] into the powers of the GNA. His initial activities began on 1 January 1924.<ref name="Mango, Atat<U+00FC>rk, 401"/> He acquired the consent of <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>, <U+00C7>akmak and <U+00D6>zalp before the abolition of the Caliphate. The Caliph made a statement to the effect that he would not interfere with political affairs.<ref name="Calipinternational"/> On 1 March 1924, at the Assembly, Mustafa Kemal said {{quote|The religion of Islam will be elevated if it will cease to be a political instrument, as had been the case in the past."<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 404</ref> |Mustafa Kemal}}

On 3 March 1924, the Caliphate was [[Ottoman Caliphate#Abolishment|officially abolished]] and its powers within Turkey were transferred to the GNA. The debate as to the validity of Turkey's unilateral abolition of the Caliphate was taken up by other Muslim nations in order to decide whether they should confirm the Turkish action or appoint a new Caliph.<ref name="Calipinternational">Majid Khadduri (2006) War and peace in the law of Islam, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., ISBN 1584776951 page 290-291</ref> A "Caliphate Conference" was held in Cairo in May 1926 and a resolution was passed declaring the Caliphate "a necessity in Islam", but failed to implement this decision.<ref name="Calipinternational"/> Two other Islamic conferences were held in Mecca (1926) and Jerusalem (1931), but failed to reach a consensus.<ref name="Calipinternational"/> Turkey did not accept the re-establishment of the Caliphate and perceived it as an attack to its basic existence; while Mustafa Kemal and the reformists continued their own way.<ref>{{cite news |first=Oktay |last=Eksi |title=Paralardaki resimler |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=8711441&yazarid=1 |work=[[Hurriyet]] |quote=<U+0130>smet Pa<U+015F>a "kurumla<U+015F>ma" ile neyi kastetti<U+011F>ini de <U+015F><U+00F6>yle anlatt<U+0131>:<br />Biz Cumhuriyeti kurdu<U+011F>umuz zaman onu ya<U+015F>at<U+0131>p ya<U+015F>atamayaca<U+011F><U+0131>m<U+0131>z en b<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k sorun idi. <U+00C7><U+00FC>nk<U+00FC> Saltanat<U+0131>n ve Hilafetin la<U+011F>v<U+0131>na kar<U+015F><U+0131> olanlar<U+0131>n say<U+0131>s<U+0131> <U+00E7>oktu ve hedefleri de Cumhuriyetti.

The removal of the Caliphate followed with an extensive effort to establish the separation of governmental and religious affairs. Education was the cornerstone in this effort. In 1923, there were three main horizontal educational institutions. The first and most common institution was [[medrese]]s (local school) based on Arabic, the Qur'an and memorization. The second type of institution was idad<U+00EE> and sultan<U+00EE> which were the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era. The last group was the colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating pupils. The old medrese education was modernized.<ref name=dew/> Mustafa Kemal changed the classical Islamic education with a vigorously promoted reconstruction of educational institutions along the line of an enlightened pragmatism.<ref name=dew/> Kemal linked educational reform to the liberation of the nation from [[dogma]], which he believed was more important than the Turkish war of independence. {{quote|Today, our most important and most productive task is the national education [unification and modernization] affairs.

In the summer of 1924, Mustafa Kemal invited American educational reformer [[John Dewey]] to advise him for the reforms and recommendations.<ref name=dew>Wolf-Gazo, ''John Dewey in Turkey: An Educational Mission, 15<U+2013>42.</ref> His [[public education]] reforms aimed to prepare citizens for roles in public life through increasing the public literacy. He wanted to institute compulsory [[primary education]] for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the Republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the "public culture". The state schools established a common [[curriculum]] which became known as the "unification of education." Unification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, and organized and operated on a deliberate model of the civil community. It established a contemporary route to the traditional social structure by causing contemporary citizen consciousness. In this new design all schools submitted their curriculum to the "[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]." It was a government agency modeled after other Ministries of Education of its time. Concurrently, the Republic abolished the two ministries and subordinated the clergy to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]]. The change was one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum was the end of "clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire." It was not the end of religious schools in Turkey which were moved to higher education until consequent governments pulled them back to [[secondary education]] after Mustafa Kemal's death.

Beginning in the fall of 1925, Mustafa Kemal encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.<ref name=UNESCO><U+0130><U+011F>demir, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 165<U+2013>170</ref> He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].<ref name=UNESCO/> The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:<U+015E>apka <U+0130>ktisas<U+0131> Hakk<U+0131>nda Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western style hats instead of the fez. Mustafa Kemal first made the hat compulsory to civil servants.<ref name=UNESCO/> The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees (or , indeed, anyone, in public space controlled by the state) were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, Mustafa Kemal wore his "[[Panama hat]]" during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern suits instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Baz<U+0131> Kisvelerin Giyilemiyece<U+011F>ine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].

Even though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Mustafa Kemal never made specific reference to women<U+2019>s clothing in the law. In the social conditions of the period, he believed that women would adapt to the new way at their own will. He was frequently photographed on public business with his wife [[L<U+00E2>tife U<U+015F>akl<U+0131>gil]], who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition. He was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern clothes. But it was Atat<U+00FC>rk's adopted daughters like [[Sabiha G<U+00F6>k<U+00E7>en]] and [[Afet <U+0130>nan]] who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future. He wrote: "The religious covering of women will not cause difficulty ... This simple style [of headcovering] is not in conflict with the morals and manners of our society."<ref>Quoted in Atat<U+00FC>rkism, Volume 1 (Istanbul: Office of the Chief of General Staff, 1982), 126.</ref>

On 30 August 1925, Mustafa Kemal's view on religious insignia used outside places of worship was introduced in his [[s:tr:Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n Kastamonu Nutku|Kastamonu speech]]. This speech also had another position. He said: {{Quote|In the face of knowledge, science, and of the whole extent of radiant civilization, I cannot accept the presence in Turkey's civilized community of people primitive enough to seek material and spiritual benefits in the guidance of sheiks. The Turkish republic cannot be a country of sheiks, dervishes, and disciples. The best, the truest order is the order of civilization. To be a man it is enough to carry out the requirements of civilization. The leaders of dervish orders will understand the truth of my words, and will themselves close down their lodges [tekke] and admit that their disciplines have grown up.<ref name=mango367>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 435</ref> |Mustafa Kemal|[[s:tr:Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n Kastamonu Nutku|Kastamonu Nutku]]}} On September 2, the government issued a decree closing down all Sufi orders and the [[tekke]]s. Mustafa Kemal ordered their dervish lodges to be converted to museums, such as [[Mevlana Museum]] in Konya. The institutional expression of Sufism became illegal in Turkey, but a politically neutral form of Sufism, functioning as social associations, was permitted to exist.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The abolition of the Caliphate and other cultural reforms were met with fierce opposition. The conservative elements were not happy and they launched attacks on the Kemalist reformists.<ref name="Calipinternational"/>

====Opposition, 1924<U+2013>1927====
[[Image:Mustaf Kemal Anatolian tours.ogg|thumb|Atat<U+00FC>rk during one of his Anatolian tours]]
In 1924, while the "Issue of Mosul" was on the table, [[Sheikh Said Piran]] began to organize the [[Sheikh Said Rebellion]]. Sheikh Said Piran was a wealthy Kurdish hereditary chieftain ([[Tribal chief]]) of a local [[Naqshbandi]] order. Piran emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Piran stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered to be against Islam. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Piran's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of [[Elaz<U+0131><U+011F>]] and [[Diyarbak<U+0131>r]].<ref>Patrick Kinross, Atat<U+00FC>rk, ''The Rebirth of a Nation'', 397</ref> Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups (The law was eventually repealed on 4 March 1929).

There were also parliamentarians in the GNA who were not happy with these changes. There were so many members who were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) that Mustafa Kemal expressed his fear of being among the minority in his own party.<ref name="PRP"> Mango, Ataturk, 418</ref> He decided not to purge this group.<ref name="PRP"/> After a [[Censure|censure motion]] gave the chance to have a breakaway group, [[Kaz<U+0131>m Karabekir]], along with his friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924. The censure became a confidence vote at the CHP for Mustafa Kemal. On 8 November the motion was rejected by 148 votes to 18, and 41 votes were absent.<ref name="PRP"/> CHP held all but one seat in the parliament. After the majority of the CHP chose him<ref name="PRP"/> Mustafa Kemal said, "the Turkish nation is firmly determined to advance fearlessly on the path of the republic, civilization and progress".<ref name="PRP"/>

On 17 November 1924, the breakaway group officially established the [[Progressive Republican Party (Turkey)|Progressive Republican Party]] (PRP) with 29 deputies and the first multi-party system began. The PRP's economic program suggested [[liberalism]], in contrast to the [[state socialism]] of CHP, and its social program was based on [[conservatism]] in contrast to the [[modernism]] of CHP. Leaders of the party strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of [[secularism]].<ref>Weiker, ''Book Review of Z<U+00FC>rcher's "Political Opposition in the Early Turkish Republic: The Progressive Republican Party, 1924<U+2013>1925"'', 297<U+2013>298</ref> The RPR was not against Mustafa Kemal's main positions as declared in its program. The program supported the main mechanisms for establishing secularism in the country and the civic law, or as stated, "the needs of the age" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49).<ref name="PRP"> Mango, Ataturk, 419</ref> These principles were set by the leaders at the onset. The only legal opposition became a home for all kinds of differing views.

During 1926, a plot to assassinate Mustafa Kemal was uncovered in [[<U+0130>zmir]]. It originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the Caliphate and had a personal grudge. The trail turned from an inquiry of the planners of this attempt to an investigation carried out ostensibly to uncover subversive activities and actually used to undermine those with differing views regarding Kemal's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought before the tribunal a large number of political opponents, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including [[Mehmet Cavit Bey|Cavid]], Ahmed <U+015E><U+00FC>kr<U+00FC>, and Ismail Canbulat were found guilty of treason and hanged.<ref>Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Z<U+00FC>rcher, 2004, Men of Order: authoritarian modernization under Ataturk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, ISBN 1860644260, page 207</ref> During these investigations there was a link that was uncovered among the members of the PRP to the Sheikh Said Rebellion. The PRP was dissolved following the outcomes of the trial. The pattern of organized opposition, however, was broken. This action was the only broad political purge during Atat<U+00FC>rk's presidency. Mustafa Kemal's saying, "My mortal body will turn into dust, but the Republic of Turkey will last forever," was regarded as a will after the assassination attempt.<ref>http://www.tsk.mil.tr/eng/Anitkabir/p24.html TSK Anitkabir sayfa 24</ref>

====Modernization efforts, 1926<U+2013>1930====
In the years following 1926, Mustafa Kemal introduced a radical departure from previous reformations established by the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Daisy"/> For the first time in history, Islamic law was clearly separated from the secular law of the nation and confined to its religious domain.<ref name="Daisy">Daisy Hilse Dwyer, (1990), "Law and Islam in the Middle East", page 77, ISBN 9780897891516</ref> Mustafa Kemal said {{quote|We must liberate our concepts of justice, our laws and our legal institutions from the bonds which, even though they are incompatible with the needs of our century, still hold a tight grip on us.<ref>Atillasoy, Atat<U+00FC>rk : The First President and Founder of the Turkish Republic, 13.</ref>|Mustafa Kemal}} On March 1, 1926 the Turkish [[Criminal law|penal code]] was passed. It was modeled after the Italian Penal Code. On October 4, 1926, [[Islamic courts]] were closed. Establishing the civic law needed time, so Kemal delayed the inclusion of the principle of [[la<U+00EF>cit<U+00E9>]] until February 5, 1937.

Ottoman practice discouraged the social interaction between men and women aligned with the Islamic practice of [[sex segregation and Islam|sex segregation]]. Mustafa Kemal began to develop the concepts of his social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff constantly discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women to social life. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal on November 1915;{{quote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.<ref name=mango164>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 164</ref>|Mustafa Kemal}}
[[Image:Ataturk opens Ankara Museum of Fine Arts and Sculpture.gif|thumb|In 1927, during the opening of the [[State Art and Sculpture Museum]]]]

Mustafa Kemal needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On October 4, 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modeled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Mustafa Kemal did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with all its women and men together. He believed that it was scientifically impossible for him to achieve progress and to become civilized if the gender separation continued as in Ottoman times.<ref>T<U+00FC>fek<U+00E7>i, ''Universality of Atat<U+00FC>rk's philosophy''</ref> During a meeting he declaimed: {{Quote|''To the women'': Win for us the battle of education and you will do yet more for your country than we have been able to do. It is to you that I appeal.</br> ''To the men'': If henceforward the women do not share in the social life of the nation, we shall never attain to our full development. We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilizations of the West.<ref>Kinross, Ataturk, The Rebirth of a Nation, p. 343</ref>|Mustafa Kemal}}

In 1927, advocated by Mustafa Kemal, the [[State Art and Sculpture Museum]] ({{lang-tr|Ankara Resim ve Heykel M<U+00FC>zesi}}) opened its doors. The museum highlighted the art of sculpture, which had hardly been practiced in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Kemal believed that "culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic."<ref name=atillasoy15> Atillasoy, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15</ref> and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as "a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal." He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon the fact that, long before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations, the Turks have had a rich culture. He instigated the policy of studying the [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]] such as the [[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], foremost of which being the [[Sumerians]] and [[Hittites]]. To link the cultural signatures of the past into public attention, he personally named the "[[S<U+00FC>merbank]]" (1932) after the Sumerians, and the "[[Etibank]]" (1935) after the Hittites. He also stressed the folk arts of the countryside as a wellspring of Turkish creativity.

[[Image:Ataturk-September 20, 1928.jpg|thumb|October 1928 issue of [[L'Illustration]] showing Atat<U+00FC>rk introducing the new [[Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Sinop]]]]
On November 1, 1928, Mustafa Kemal introduced the [[Turkish alphabet]] as a replacement for [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]] and as a solution to the literacy problem. Literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population at the time. Dewey noted that learning how to read and write in Turkish with Arabic script took roughly three years with rather strenuous methods at the elementary level.<ref name=dew/> They used the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Language]] written in [[Arabic langueges|Arabic]] script with Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]] loan vocabulary.<ref name=dew/> The creation of the new Turkish alphabet as a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]] was undertaken by the ''Language Commission'' ({{lang-tr|Dil Enc<U+00FC>meni}}) with the initiative of Mustafa Kemal.<ref name=dew/> The tutelage was received from an Ottoman-Armenian calligrapher.<ref>{{cite news|title=T<U+00FC>rke<U+015F>, Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131> hat<U+0131>rlatt<U+0131>|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2005/04/25/yazar/dundar.html|quote=Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n imzas<U+0131>n<U+0131> bir Ermeni g<U+00FC>zel yaz<U+0131> hocas<U+0131>n<U+0131>n <U+00E7>izdi<U+011F>ini duymu<U+015F> muydun?|work=[[Milliyet]]|first=Can|last=Dundar|date=2005-04-25|language=Turkish}}</ref> The first [[Turkish newspapers|Turkish newspaper]] using the new alphabet was published on December 15, 1928. Kemal himself actively encouraged people and made many trips to the countryside in order to teach the new alphabet. The adaptation to the new alphabet was very quick. Beginning in 1932, the ''[[People's Houses]]'' ({{lang-tr|Halk Evleri}}) opened throughout the country. The older population of Turkey received help at People's Houses. There were congresses for discussing the issues of copyright, public education and scientific publishing. Literacy reform was also supported by strengthening the private publishing sector with a new law on copyrights.

Mustafa Kemal promoted modern [[teaching method]]s at the primary education level, and Dewey took a place of honour.<ref name=dew/> Dewey presented a paradigmatic set of recommendations designed for developing societies that are moving towards modernity in his "Report and Recommendation for the Turkish educational system."<ref name=dew/> He was interested in [[adult education]] for the goal of forming a [[Skill (labor)|skill base]] in the country. Turkish women were taught not only child care, dress-making and household management, but also the tools that they needed to use in becoming part of the general economy. Turkish education became a state-supervised system, which was designed to create a skill base for the social and economic progress of the country.<ref><U+00D6>zelli, ''The Evolution of the Formal Educational System and Its Relation to Economic Growth Policies in the First Turkish Republic'', 77<U+2013>92</ref> His "unified" education program was designed to educate responsible citizens as well as useful and appreciated members of society.<ref name=dew/> Turkish education became an integrative system, aimed to alleviate poverty and used [[female education]] to establish [[gender equality]].

Mustafa Kemal constantly tried to generate media to propagate modern education during this period. He instigated official education meetings called "Science Boards" and "Education Summits." The quality of education, training issues and certain basic educational principles were discussed at these meetings. He said, "our schools [curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve." He was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one was ''{{lang-tr|Vatanda<U+015F> <U+0130><U+00E7>in Medeni Bilgiler}}'' (1930). The second one was ''Geometry'' (1937), a text for high schools. The ''Vatanda<U+015F> <U+0130><U+00E7>in Medeni Bilgiler'' (''Civic knowledge for the citizens'') introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions.

====Opposition, 1930<U+2013>1931====
[[Image:Ataturk and Fethi Okyar.jpg|thumb|On 13 August 1930, [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] leader [[Ali Fethi Okyar]], his daughter and Atat<U+00FC>rk in [[Yalova]]]]
On August 11, 1930, Mustafa Kemal decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] to establish a new party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atat<U+00FC>rk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.

On December 23, 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.

In November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party after seeing the rising fundamentalist threat. Mustafa Kemal never succeeded in establishing a long lasting multi-party parliamentary system. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950 the RPP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Kemal did not promote [[direct democracy]] by dominating the country with his single party rule. The reason behind the failed experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Mustafa Kemal's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: "between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat<U+00FC>rk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime."<ref> Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 536</ref> Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of eventually building a [[civil society]]; a system of totality of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions that form the basis of a functioning society as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of his many speeches about the importance of democracy, Mustafa Kemal said in the year 1933: {{Quote|Republic means the democratic administration of the state. We founded the Republic, reaching its tenth year. It should enforce all the requirements of democracy as the time comes."''<ref><U+0130>nan, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk Hakk<U+0131>nda Hat<U+0131>ralar ve Belgeler'', 260</ref>|Mustafa Kemal}}

In 1931, Mustafa Kemal took the lead in establishing the [[Turkish Language Association]] for conducting research works in the [[Turkish language]] ({{lang-tr|T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu}}). The establishment of the [[Turkish Historical Society]] ({{lang-tr|T<U+00FC>rk Tarih Kurumu}}) was archived in 1932 for conducting research works on the [[history of Turkey]].

Beginning in 1932, several hundred "[[People's Houses]]" ({{lang-tr|Halk Evi}}) and "People's Rooms" (Halk Odas<U+0131>) across the country allowed greater access to a wide variety of artistic activities, sports, and other cultural events. The [[Visual arts|visual]] and the [[plastic arts]], whose developers had, on occasion, been arrested by some Ottoman officials claiming that the depiction of the human form was [[idolatry]], were now highly encouraged and supported by Atat<U+00FC>rk. Many museums were opened, architecture began to follow modern trends, and [[Classical period (music)|classical Western music]], [[opera]], and [[ballet]], as well as the [[theatre]], also took greater hold. Book and magazine publications increased as well, and the film industry began to grow.

In 1934, Mustafa Kemal commissioned the first Turkish operatic work, ''<U+00D6>zsoy''. The opera, which was staged at the People's House in Ankara, was composed by [[Adnan Saygun]] and performed by soprano [[Semiha Berksoy]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Selda | last=Paydak | title=Interview with Semiha Berksoy | url=http://www.deltur.cec.eu.int/english/guncel/ghaber-jan00_18.html | publisher=Representation of the European Commission to Turkey | date= January 2000 | accessdate=2007-02-11|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20030418082022/http://www.deltur.cec.eu.int/english/guncel/ghaber-jan00_18.html |archivedate=2003-04-18 }}</ref>

On December 5, 1934, Turkey moved to grant full political rights to women. It was well before [[Timeline of women's suffrage|several other European nations]]. The equal rights of women in marriage had already been established in the earlier Turkish civil code.<ref><U+00D6>m<U+00FC>r, ''[http://www.theturkishtimes.com/archive/02/12_01/c_women.html Modernity and Islam: Experiences of Turkish Women]''</ref> The place of women in Mustafa Kemal's cultural reforms was best expressed in the civic book which was prepared under his supervision.<ref>Atat<U+00FC>rk, ''Vatanda<U+015F> <U+0130><U+00E7>in Medeni Bilgiler''</ref> Mustafa Kemal said that {{quote|There is no logical explanation for the political disenfranchisement of women.

====Issue of Mosul====
[[Image:Abdullah I of Jordan and Mustafa Kemal on 1937.jpg|thumb|During the visit of [[Abdullah I of Jordan]]]]
The "Issue of Mosul" was one of the first foreign affairs-related controversies of the new Republic. It was a dispute with the [[United Kingdom]] over the control of the [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul Province]]. During the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], General Marshall followed the British War Office's instruction that "every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew" and captured Mosul three days after the signature of the [[Armistice of Mudros]] ([[30 October]] [[1918]]).<ref name="britainsoil">Peter Sluglett, "The Primacy of Oil in Britain<U+2019>s Iraq Policy", in the book "Britain in Iraq: 1914-1932" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103-116</ref> In 1920, the ''[[Misak-<U+0131> Milli]]'', which consolidated the "Turkish lands" based on a common past, history, concept of morals and laws, declared that the Mosul Province was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul, and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect their interests. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. Presumably, from a British perspective, if Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk succeeded in securing stability on his side, he would have turned his attention to recovering Mosul and penetrate into Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him. Thus, an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation would be brought up to the very gates of India. In 1923, Mustafa Kemal tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] over the Mosul did not mean giving up Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on both sides of the population. Later, it was claimed that Turkey began where the oil ends as the border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on the oil reserves. Atat<U+00FC>rk did not want this separation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.candundar.com.tr/index.php?Did=766 |title= Atat<U+00FC>rk ya<U+015F>asayd<U+0131> |accessdate= 2008-01-01 |author= Can Dundar |language= Turkish |quote=...

On 23 January 1923, Lord Curzon argued that the existence of oil was no more than hypothetical.<ref name="britainsoil" /> However, according to Armstrong, "England wanted oil. Mosul and Kurds were the key."<ref>Harold Courtenay Armstrong Gray Wolf, Mustafa Kemal: An Intimate Study of a Dictator. page 225</ref>

While three inspectors from the League of Nations Committee were sent to the region to oversee the situation in 1924, the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]], beginning in 1924 and escalating until 1927, broke out to establish a new government positioned to cut Turkey's link to Mesopotamia. The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, could not stand by itself.<ref>Olson, Robert W. (1989) The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880-1925, p.45</ref>

In 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.<ref> Kinross, 401</ref> As a result of these maneuvers, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atat<U+00FC>rk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate. Turkey was in ruins, reconstruction was difficult, poverty was everywhere and people were in pain, which easily fed separatist violence.<ref>ASD: Speeches and statements by Ataturk, volume I pages 361-363 published by Atatuk Culture, language and history Higher Institude, Ankara 1989</ref> Mustafa Kemal attributed the rebellion to certain notables rather than a section of the population, who had been found guilty by the courts (kanunen mucrim olan bazi muteneffizan) and who used the mask of religion to conceal the interests of landlords, feudal tribal leaders and other "reactionaries" on 7 March 1925.<ref name=mangokurds20>Andrew Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk and the Kurds'', Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20</ref>

====Soviet Union====
[[Image:Ataturk hosts kings and presidents.jpg|thumb|360|During a reception at the [[USSR]] Embassy in Ankara, on 7 November 1927]]
Mustafa Kemal wanted positive relations with his country's northern neighbor. He signed the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] with [[Bolshevist Russia]]. The relations were cordial but had a distinct character of the common interests. The basic character of their relationship during [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk's leadership of the independence war]] was based on the fact that they were fighting against a common enemy: Britain and the West.<ref name="Y<U+0131>lmaz"/> He cooperated with the Soviets during the [[Turkish war of independence|war of independence]] in order to establish the new state.

"Friendship with Russia," said Mustafa Kemal, "is not to adopt their ideology of communism for Turkey."<ref name="Y<U+0131>lmaz">Y<U+0131>lmaz Altu<U+011F>, Foreign Policy Of Atat<U+00FC>rk, Ataturk arastirma merkezi dergisi, Vol VI, No 16, November 1989</ref> He declared: "Communism is a social issue. Social conditions, religion, and national traditions of our country confirm the opinion that Russian Communism is not applicable in Turkey."<ref>Y<U+0131>lmaz Altu<U+011F>, T<U+00FC>rk Devrim Tarihi Dersim, 1919-1938, 1980 s. p. 136.</ref> On a 1 November 1924 speech he said: "Our amicable relations with our old friend the Soviet Russian Republic are developing and progressing every day. As in past our Republican Government regards genuine and extensive good relations with Soviet Russia as the Keynote of our foreign policy."<ref name="Y<U+0131>lmaz"/><U+201D>

These cordial relations were tested during the Issue of Mosul. Curzon insisted during the Lausanne Conference (1923) that Mosul belonged to Iraq, and it would be under the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. In 1923, Kemal refused to accept this position, and on the same day signed a non-aggression and security pact with Soviet Russia in Paris. This pact remained in effect until it was unilaterally abrogated by the Soviet Union in 1945{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

The visit was historically important, as no member of the [[Politburo]] or Steering Committee of Moscow's ruling Communist Party had ventured outside the Soviet Union since it was founded.<ref name="BalkanFed"/>.

During the second half of the 1930s, Mustafa Kemal tried to establish a closer relationship with Britain in an effort to improve relations with the West. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] quoted the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Soviet Union, [[Maxim Litvinov]]: "Litvinov told me that the most valuable and interesting leader in the world does not live in Europe but beyond the Straits in Ankara and that he was the President of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal."<ref>[http://www.tekadamdevrimi.com/tekadamdevrimi/tad_ingilizce/tad_ingilizce_03.htm Quotations on Atat<U+00FC>rk]</ref>"

====Turkish-Greek alliance====
[[Image:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|Hosting the Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] (at left) on October 1932]]
The post-war leader of Greece, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], was also determined to establish normal relations between the two states. The war had devastated the lands of [[Aegean Region|Western Anatolia]], and the financial burden of [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Ottoman Muslim refugees]] from Greece brought obstacles to the rapprochement. Venizelos moved forward with the agreement despite accusations of making too many concessions on the issues of the naval armaments, and the properties of the Ottoman Greeks from Turkey according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, p. 95-97</ref> Similarly, Kemal resisted the pressures of historic emnities or atrocity-mongering between the societies. In spite of Turkish animosity against the Greeks, Kemal showed acute sensitivity to even the slightest allusion to these tensions. Kemal at one instance ordered immediate removal of a painting showing a Turkish soldier plunging his bayonet to a Greek soldier by stating, "What a revolting scene!".<ref> Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, "Turkey's Diplomatic treaties", TTK, Ankara page 29</ref>

Ultimately, many Greeks consider the reconciliation with Turkey among the greatest foreign policy achievements of Venizelos' final term as Prime Minister. Greece renounced all its claims over Turkish territory and the two sides concluded an agreement on 30 April 1930. On 25 October, Venizelos visited Turkey, and signed a treaty of friendship.<ref>{{cite book

Indeed, Venizelos' successor [[Panagis Tsaldaris]] came to visit Atat<U+00FC>rk in September 1933 and signed a more comprehensive agreement, called the [[Entente Cordiale (Turkey-Greece)|Entente Cordiale]], a stepping stone for the [[Balkan Pact]]. 

Greek Premier [[Ioannis Metaxas]] said of Atat<U+00FC>rk and the Turkish-Greek alliance, that "...Greece, which has the highest estimation of the renowned leader, heroic soldier, and enlightened creator of Turkey. We will never forget that President Atat<U+00FC>rk was the true founder of the Turkish-Greek alliance based on a framework of common ideals and peaceful cooperation. He developed ties of friendship between the two nations which it would be unthinkable to dissolve. Greece will guard its fervent memories of this great man, who determined an unalterable future path for the noble Turkish nation."

====Treaty of Saadabad====
[[Image:Faisal I of Iraq and Mustafa Kemal Ankara Depot on 1931.jpg|thumb|During the visit of [[Faisal I of Iraq]] in 1931]]
One of the main goals of Mustafa Kemal was to establish security and peace on the eastern border of the new republic. These states had high stakes in preserving their common frontiers. Consulting together in all matters of common interest benefited them more than keeping diplomatic channels closed. Relations developed slowly during this period and eventually led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Saadabad]].

Mustafa Kemal was implementing [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's reforms|his reforms]], when he found cooperation with Afghanistan.{{Clarify|date=December 2008}} Afghanistan was in the midst of a reformation period under [[reforms of Amanullah Khan and civil war|Amanullah Khan]]. Afghan Foreign Minister [[Mahmud Tarzi]] was a follower of Mustafa Kemal's domestic policy. He encouraged [[Amanullah Khan]] in social and political reform but urged that reforms should be gradually built upon the basis of a strong government. During the late 1920s, Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fears of an Afghan-Soviet friendship. On 20 May 1928, Anglo-Afghan politics gained a positive perspective, when Amanullah Khan and the Queen were received by Mustafa Kemal in Istanbul. This meeting was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. Mustafa Kemal supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations. In 1934 Afghanistan's relations with the international community gained a huge boost when it joined the League of Nations.<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Journal of International Law |last=Jentleson |first=Bruce W. |coauthors=Paterson, Thomas G. |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195110552 |page=24 }}</ref> In 1937, King [[Zahir Shah]] became a signatory of the Treaty of Saadabad. Mahmud Tarzi received Mustafa Kemal's personal support until he died on 22 November 1933 in Istanbul.

Mustafa Kemal and [[Reza Shah]] had a common approach regarding [[British imperialism]] and its influence in their region. This climate created a slow but continuous rapprochement between Ankara and Tehran. Both governments sent diplomatic missions and messages of friendship to each other during the Turkish war of independence.<ref>Narli, Nil<U+00FC>fer (1993): "Turco-Iranian Relations from the Islamic Revolution to Gulf War and Beyond: Co-operation or Competition in the Muslim World".

Reza Shah visited him in 1934. In 1935 the draft of what would become the Saadabad Pact was paragraphed in Geneva, but the signing of it was delayed because of the [[Iran-Iraq border|border dispute between Iran and Iraq]]. Iran challenged the validity of both the Treaty of Erzerum and the Constantinople Protocol in 1934.

On 8 July 1937, the [[Treaty of Saadabad|Saadabad Pact]] was signed at [[Tehran]] by Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. The signatories undertook to preserve their common frontiers, to consult together in all matters of common interest and to commit no aggression against one another<U+2019>s territory. The treaty united common points between the Afghan king<U+2019>s call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern Cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free herself from Soviet and British influence, and Mustafa Kemal's foreign policy based on common interest to secure stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.<ref> Mango, Ataturk, page 510</ref>

====Turkish Straits====
[[Image:King Edward VIII and Mustafa Kemal.jpg|thumb|During the visit of [[King Edward VIII]]]]
On July 24 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign war vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and,  even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, the management of the waterway to be left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.

In March 1936, Hitler's reoccupation of the Rhineland gave Mustafa Kemal the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. "The situation in Europe", he declared "is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it".<ref> Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, "Turkey's Diplomatic treaties", TTK, Ankara page 493</ref> [[Tevfik R<U+00FC><U+015F>t<U+00FC> Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, Ismet In<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>. In<U+014D>n<U+00FC> was worried about harming the relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavorable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Mustafa Kemal demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.

On July 20 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument, a legal cornerstone, that governed the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936, and is still valid today.

====Balkan Pact====
[[Image:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]
Until the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Mustafa Kemal's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.

In the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Mustafa Kemal strongly believed that a close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries, and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize. In inter-Balkan relations, improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are worth mentioning.

The [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Mustafa Kemal with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. He thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.<ref>Yilmaz Altu<U+00F0>, "Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n Dis Politikas<U+00FD>," B.<U+00DC>. Uluslararasi Atat<U+00FC>rk Konferans<U+00FD> Tebligleri, 10-11 November 1980, Vol. II, Istanbul 1981, p. 486.</ref> Mustafa Kemal was particularly anxious to establish a region of security and alliances in the west of Turkey and in Balkan Europe, which would extend as far as [[Dobruja]].<ref><U+00DE>evket S<U+00FC>reyya Aydemir, Tek Adam, Vol. 3, <U+00DD>stanbul 1988, p. 331.</ref>

The Balkan Pact provided for regular military and diplomatic consultations. It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atat<U+00FC>rk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:{{Quote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this. The forces that defend our borders are a single and inseparable force.<ref> Atat<U+00FC>rk'<U+00FC>n Milli D<U+00FD><U+00FE> Politikas<U+00FD>, Vol. 2, p. 355</ref>"|Mustafa Kemal}} It was signed by GNA on Feb 28. The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the agreement a few days after. The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.

The Balkan Pact turned out to be an ineffective organization for reasons that were beyond Atat<U+00FC>rk<U+2019>s control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria<U+2019>s attempt to put the Dobruja issue into the agenda after a series of international events ended with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, ending with [[World War II]]. The goal of Atat<U+00FC>rk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atat<U+00FC>rk's Republic of Turkey.

====Issue of Hatay====
[[Image:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atat<U+00FC>rk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]
Turkish Prime-Minister [[Ismet Inonu]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atat<U+00FC>rk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The given risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atat<U+00FC>rk and Ismet.

In 1936 Atat<U+00FC>rk raised the "Issue of Hatay" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[<U+0130>skenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.

Mustafa Kemal instigated economic policies not just to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.<ref>Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347<U+2013>357</ref> Mustafa Kemal's vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[<U+0130>zmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of Mustafa Kemal's economic policies were a reflection of the realities of his period. After [[World War I]], due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Kemal's activities regarding the economy included the establishment of many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.

====State intervention, 1923<U+2013>1929====

Mustafa Kemal and [[<U+0130>smet <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>]] had a national vision in their pursuit of the state controlled economical polices. Kemal and <U+0130>smet wanted to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications. Istanbul, a trading port with international foreign enterprises, was deliberately abandoned and resources were channeled to other, relatively less developed cities, in order to establish a more balanced development throughout the country.<ref name=mango470>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 470</ref>

For Mustafa Kemal, as for his supporters, tobacco remained wedded to his policy in the pursuit of economic independence. [[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture were French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the "Regie Compagnie interessee des tabacs de l'empire Ottoman" and "Narquileh tobacco."<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232<U+2013>233.</ref> The Ottoman Empire gave the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the "[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with an unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm|title=T<U+00FC>t<U+00FC>n, <U+0130><U+00E7>ki ve Tekel|language=Turkish |date=2003-01-29 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |last=Aysu |first=Abdullah|publisher=B<U+0130>A Haber Merkezi}}</ref> In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named "[[Tekel]]". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's "[[nationalization]]" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey.

In 1924, with the initiative of Mustafa Kemal, the first Turkish bank [[<U+0130><U+015F> Bankas<U+0131>]] was established. He was the first member of <U+0130><U+015F> Bankas<U+0131>. The bank was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.

In 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Mustafa Kemal considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. The road network consisted of 13,885&nbsp;km of ruined surface roads, 4.450&nbsp;km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called "Sose ve Kopruler Reisligi" which would be the driving force of new roads after the World War II. However, in 1937 the 22,000&nbsp;km of roads in Turkey were mainly a system to aid the railways.

The national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Kemal as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was based on agriculture, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient; and the management of the economy was inefficient. The Great Depression brought many changes to this picture.

====Great Depression, 1929<U+2013>1931====
[[Image:Ataturk-Organized industrial complex.jpg|thumb|Atat<U+00FC>rk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[S<U+00FC>merbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]]]]
The young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Mustafa Kemal reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic polices, and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meager possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.<ref name=mango470/>

In 1929, Mustafa Kemal signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic. 

In 1931, Mustafa Kemals's intention to establish the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The main intention behind the bank was to have control over the exchange rate. The [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was slowly ceased. Later specialized banks such as the [[S<U+00FC>merbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded. 

From the [[political economy]] perspective, Mustafa Kemal had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed. He asked [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] to fulfill this need. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August, 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Mustafa Kemal supported <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>'s point of view: "it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development." In 1931, he proclaimed: "In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism."<ref>Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90</ref> However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano<U+011F>lu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Mustafa Kemal found a third way between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]].<ref>Mango, ''Atat<U+00FC>rk'', 478</ref>

====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931<U+2013>1939====

The first (1929-1933) and second five year economic plans were performed under the supervision of Mustafa Kemal. The first five year economic plan promoted consumer substitution industries. However, these economic plans changed drastically with the death of Kemal and the rise of [[World War II]]. Subsequent governments took measures that harmed the economic productivity of Turkey in various ways.<ref name=etatism>Barlas, ''Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies in an Uncertain World, 1929<U+2013>1939''</ref> The achievements of the 1930s were credited to early (1920s) implementation of the economic system based on the national policies of Mustafa Kemal and his team.<ref>Emrence, ''Turkey in economic crisis (1927<U+2013>1930): a panaromic vision. Journal Middle Eastern Studies''</ref>

In 1931, Mustafa Kemal watched the first national aircraft MMV-1. He realized the important role of aviation. In his words, "the future lies in the skies".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-11-26|url=http://www.thy.com/en-INT/skylife/archive/en/2000_1/konu10.htm#1|title=Skylife}}</ref> [[Turkish Aeronautical Association]] was founded in February 16, 1925 by his directive.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-11-26|url=http://www.thk.org.tr/yeni/tarihce/tarihceeng.htm|title=History of Turkish Aeronautical Association}}</ref> He ordered the establishment of the Turkish Aircraft Association Lottery. Instead of the traditional raffle prizes, this new lottery paid money prizes. The major part of its income was transferred to establish a new factory. The income from this lottery was used in funding aviation projects. Mustafa Kemal did not see the flight of the first Turkish military aircraft built at the factory. Operational American [[Curtiss Hawk]] fighters were being produced soon after his death and before the onset of World War II.

In 1932, liberal economist [[Celal Bayar]] became the Minister of Economy at Mustafa Kemal's request and served until 1937.<ref>Dilek Barlas, Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies p. 61</ref> During this period, the country moved toward mixed economy with first private initiatives. Textile, sugar, paper and steel factories (financed by a loan from England) were the private sectors of the period. Besides these government owned power plants, banks, and insurance companies were established.

In 1935, the first Turkish cotton print factory "Nazilli [[Calico (textile)|Calico]] print factory" opened. Cotton planting was promoted to furnish raw material for future factory settlements, part of the industrialization process.<ref>Webster, ''The Turkey of Atat<U+00FC>rk: Social Process in the Turkish Reformation'', 260</ref> One of the centers for factory settlements was [[Nazilli]]. Nazilli become a major center beginning with the establishment of [[cotton mill]]s and was followed by a calico print factory by 1935.<ref>Do<U+011F>an, ''Formation of factory settlements within Turkish industrialization and modernization in 1930s: Nazilli printing factory''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313679A66406202CCB09837F9A3538A2623 |title = Ayd<U+0131>n <U+2014> Historical Ruins |accessdate = 2007 |author = Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Culture and Tourism |publisher = T.C.

It is the "first Turkish cotton print factory" the foundation of which was laid on 25 August 1935 and which was opened by Atat<U+00FC>rk with great ceremony.}}</ref>

On 25 October 1937, Mustafa Kemal appointed [[Celal Bayar]] as the prime minister of the 9th government. Integrated economic policies reached their peak with the signing of the 1939 Treaty with Britain and France.<ref name=etatism/> This signaled a turning point in Turkish history.<ref name=etatism/> It was the first step towards an alliance with the "West".<ref name=etatism/> Celal Bayar served as prime minister until Mustafa Kemal's death. The differences of opinion between In<U+00F6>n<U+00FC> (state control) and Celal Bayar (liberal) came to the forefront after <U+0130>n<U+00F6>n<U+00FC> became president in 1938. On 25 January 1939, Prime Minister Bayar resigned.

Mustafa Kemal supported the establishment of the automobile industry. He wanted it to become a center in the region. The motto of the [[Turkish automobile association]] was: "The Turkish driver is a man of the most exquisite sensitivities."<ref>Stone, Norman "Talking Turkey". National Interest, Fall2000, Issue 61.</ref>

During 1935, Turkey was becoming an industrial society on the Western European model set out by Atat<U+00FC>rk.<ref name=5year>Eastham, ''The Turkish Development Plan: The First Five Years'', 132<U+2013>136</ref> At the time of his death, most regions of Turkey had viable micro-economic stability and some macro economic stability. These signs of sound economic policies were marked by the first-ever emergence of local banks. However, the gap between Mustafa Kemal<U+2019>s goals and the achievements of the socio-political structure of the country was not closed.<ref name=5year/>

====Dersim Massacre, 1937====
In 1937 Atat<U+00FC>rk headed the Dersim operation where (official 30'000) 70'000 people were killed in Dersim village. The name was changed just after the operation to Tunceli.

==Personal life==

On 29 January 1923, Mustafa Kemal married [[Latife U<U+015F>akl<U+0131>gil]]; they were divorced on August 5, 1925.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Crescent and the Couch: Cross-Currents Between Islam and Psychoanalysis |last= Akhtar |first= Salman |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2008 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |location= |isbn= 0765705745 |page= 68 |pages= |url= }}</ref> He never remarried. During his lifetime, Atat<U+00FC>rk adopted seven daughters and a son. 

In his leisure time, he enjoyed reading and writing (books and a personal journal), horseback riding, chess, and swimming. He was also an avid dancer and enjoyed both the waltz and traditional Zeybek folk dances.

==Illness and death==

During 1937, indications that Atat<U+00FC>rk's health was worsening started to appear. In early 1938, while he was on a trip to [[Yalova]], he suffered from a serious illness. He went to <U+0130>stanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]] of the liver due to heavy alcohol consumption.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1981, the centennial of Atat<U+00FC>rk's birth, the memory of Atat<U+00FC>rk was honored by the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]], which declared it ''The Atat<U+00FC>rk Year in the World'' and adopted the [[Atat<U+00FC>rk Centennial|Resolution on the Atat<U+00FC>rk Centennial]]. The Atat<U+00FC>rk Memorial in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] (which also serves as a memorial to the ANZAC troops who died at Gallipoli); the [[Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk Memorial, Canberra|Atat<U+00FC>rk Memorial in the place of honour on ANZAC drive]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]; the Atat<U+00FC>rk Forest in [[Israel]]; and the Atat<U+00FC>rk Square in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], are only a few examples.
