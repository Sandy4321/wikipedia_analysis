Born in California to a family of actors, he made it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination in [[1987]] for his performance in the revival of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[All My Sons]]''. After several [[TV movie]] appearances, Sheridan landed a starring role as lawyer Jack Shannon on ''[[Shannon's Deal]]'', which ran for one season in [[1990]]. His later television roles include Dr. John Sutton on ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' (from [[1995]]&ndash;[[1996]]).

Sheridan started his film career in the late 1980s with small roles. By the 1990s, he was playing the token family man, a role he would continue in both film and television. He was also capable of playing villains, such as [[Randall Flagg]] in the [[1994]] miniseries adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]''. Other roles include Marty Stouffer in ''Wild America'' and the psychotic neighbor in ''Video Voyeur: The Susan Wilson Story''. After a long history of performing [[Shakespeare]] on the stage, Sheridan appeared in [[Campbell Scott]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 2000 as well as the Hamlet-inspired modern [[film noir|noir film]] ''[[Let the Devil Wear Black]]'' (1999). He has also given fine supporting performances in ''[[The Ice Storm]]'', ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', ''[[Life as a House]]'', and numerous TV movies. 

More recently, Sheridan played [[James Deakins|Capt. James Deakins]] in the [[television series]] ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]''. Late in the 2004&ndash;2005 season, Sheridan began wearing an eyepatch as he began showing the symptoms of [[Bell's palsy]]. This was written into the show, but as of the 2005&ndash;2006 season, it is no longer an issue for Deakins nor, presumably, for Sheridan.  Deakins was written out of the series at the end of the 2005-2006 season, at Sheridan's request.
