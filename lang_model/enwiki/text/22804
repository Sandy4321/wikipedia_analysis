'''Quemerford''' is a suburb of the town of [[Calne]] in the county of [[Wiltshire]], [[South West England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==History of Quemerford==

Quemerford is in the parish of Calne, on the edge of Calne in Wiltshire, situated on the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4 road]] between [[Bristol]] and [[London]], and 28 miles north-west of [[Salisbury]]. The [[River Marden]] flows behind the village at the bottom of a slope, before passing through Calne into the Avon.<ref>National Gazetteer (London, 1868), i, p. 454; ii, p. 269. </ref>

In the mid-19th century, Quemerford had a population of 635 inhabitants.<ref>Samuel Lewis, Topographical Dictionary, iii, p. 602.</ref> According to etymologists, the name is derived from the Old English Cynemaeres-ford, meaning the ford at the royal (cyne) boundary (maere) or lake (mere).<ref name="Ekwall">Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English place-names (Oxford, 1936), pp. 359 and 296.</ref> The etymologist Ekwall notes the early variants of the name include Camerford (1204), Kemerford (1226-1228), Quemerford (1240-1245), Cameresford (1292), and Quemerforde (1294).<ref name="Ekwall"/>

Today, Quemerford is part of the town of Calne, which claims to be <U+201C>of very remote antiquity.<U+201D> The parish website claims the town has one of the longest histories in Wiltshire. The first recorded mention of the town was in the will of King Edred in 955. Calne was probably laid out as a deliberate settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period, when it was described as a villa regia, meaning a place on crown land. In 977, Archbishop Dunstan of Canterbury presided at a synod in Calne to settle a dispute between monks and secular clergy. During the synod, the floor of the chapter gave way, and several secular priests were killed although the monks escaped unhurt. Calne became famous for wool and bacon from then on, with extensive mill development in the town. 

Calne is currently a quickly expanding semi-industrial town, and an extremely important town in Wiltshire, despite the Harris Pork Factory closing in 1982. <ref>Lewis (i, 1842), pp. 468-469.</ref>
