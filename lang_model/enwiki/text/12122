As of 31 May 2008, the town had a [[population]] of 20,371<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.town.shiraoi.hokkaido.jp/default.htm|title=Shiraoi Official Web Page|date=2006-10-03|publisher=Shiraoi Town|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> The town was established in 1867 by the feudal lords of [[Sendai Domain|Sendai]]. Most of the area of the town is forested and parts lie within the [[Shikotsu-T<U+014D>ya National Park]].

==History==
Shiraoi like the rest of Hokkaid<U+014D> was populated by the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. According to the town's official website, the name, Shiraoi, means ''[[Rainbow]]s are frequent here'' in the [[Ainu language]].<ref name="Local Page"/> Other sources state that the name comes from ''Shiraunai'' meaning ''[[Horse-fly|Horse-flies]] are common here''.<ref>{{nihongo|Akagi Sanpei|<U+8D64><U+6728> <U+4E09><U+5175>}}, {{nihongo|Journey of Hokkaid<U+014D> Place Names<U+2014>Notes on Ainu Language Place Names|<U+5317><U+6D77><U+9053> <U+5730><U+540D><U+306E><U+65C5><U+2014><U+30A2><U+30A4><U+30CC><U+8A9E><U+5730><U+540D><U+89E3> |Hokkaid<U+014D> Chimei no Tabi <U+2014> Ainugo Chimei Kai}}, pg 65.</ref>

In 1867 the Sendai domain established a fort in Shiraoi and work began on {{nihongo|Shiogama Shrine|<U+5869><U+91DC><U+795E><U+793E>|Shiogama Jinja}}. The following year the [[Boshin War]] caused Sendai to retreat from Shiraoi and return to Sendai proper. After the revolt was put down the government dismantled the fort in 1870.

The end of the 19th century saw expansion of the town. A road was established connecting Shiraoi with [[Muroran]], [[Sapporo]], and [[Hakodate]] in 1873. Nineteen years later the first railroad station was established. The villages of Shadai and Shikiu were established. Two significant events occurred during this expansion: in 1874 [[Mount Tarumae]] eruped and in 1881 the [[Emperor Meiji]] visited.<ref name="History Page">{{cite web|url=http://www.town.shiraoi.hokkaido.jp/english/profile/history1.htm|title=History 1800|date=2006-10-03|publisher=Shiraoi Official Website|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>
