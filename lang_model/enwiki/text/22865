'''State Road 23''' is a partially-built western bypass of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. Its south end will be at [[State Road 21 (Florida)|SR 21]], and it is planned to continue south and east as a planned bridge over the [[St. Johns River]] (which will connect to [[State Road 9B (Florida)|SR 9B]]). The north end will be at [[State Road 8 (Florida)|SR 8]] ([[Interstate 10|I-10]]), with a possible extension as a northwest bypass to [[State Road 9 (Florida)|SR 9]] ([[Interstate 95|I-95]]). Currently it is a surface road, built on new right-of-way and a rebuilding of Branan Field Road, but there are plans for a full [[freeway]].

==History==
SR 23 was originally going to be built as a toll road by the [[Florida's Turnpike Authority]], but those plans fell through.

By 2003, the [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] section was open, and connected south to a local road (Branan Field Road) in [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]].

By late 2004, the [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]] section was added.

SR 23 was defined in the [[1945 Florida State Road renumbering|1945 renumbering]] as:
* From a point on [[State Road 25 (Florida)|SR 25]] and [[State Road 20 (Florida)|20]] approximately one mile Northwest of [[Paradise, Florida|Paradise]] in a Northwesterly direction to the intersection with [[State Road 235 (Florida)|SR 235]] in [[LaCrosse, Florida|LaCrosse]] and along [[State Road 235 (Florida)|SR 235]] for approximately .07 of a mile, then continuing Northwesterly via [[Santa Fe, Florida|Santa Fe]] to a junction with [[State Road 18 (Florida)|SR 18]] at [[Worthington Springs, Florida|Worthington Springs]] and along [[State Road 18 (Florida)|SR 18]] to a point approximately one mile north of [[Worthington Springs, Florida|Worthington Springs]], then Northeasterly to a junction with [[State Road 100 (Florida)|SR 100]] in [[Lake Butler, Union County, Florida|Lake Butler]] and East on [[State Road 100 (Florida)|SR 100]] to a point near the East City limits of [[Lake Butler, Union County, Florida|Lake Butler]] then Northeasterly via [[Raiford, Florida|Raiford]] to junction with [[State Road 10 (Florida)|SR 10]] in [[MacClenny, Florida|MacClenny]] and along [[State Road 10 (Florida)|SR 10]] to 5th St. then in a Northerly direction along 5th St. and to the [[St. Marys River (Florida-Georgia)|St. Mary's River]] at the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] State Line.

Prior to the renumbering, this had been:
* [[Pre-1945 Florida State Road 99|SR 99]] from northwest of [[Paradise, Florida|Paradise]] to [[Worthington Springs, Florida|Worthington Springs]]
* [[Pre-1945 Florida State Road 113|SR 113]] from northwest of [[Paradise, Florida|Paradise]] to [[LaCrosse, Florida|LaCrosse]]
* [[Pre-1945 Florida State Road 49|SR 49]] from [[Worthington Springs, Florida|Worthington Springs]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]

At some point, SR 23 was renumbered as part of [[State Road 121 (Florida)|SR 121]], probably to match [[Georgia State Road 121]]. Before that, however, SR 23 had been extended around the west side of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] to end at [[State Road 25 (Florida)|SR 25]] ([[U.S. Highway 441|US 441]]) at [[Rocky Point, Florida|Rocky Point]], and the southernmost part did not become part of [[State Road 121 (Florida)|SR 121]]. It was later given to the county, and may be [[Alachua County, Florida Road 23|CR 23]].
