==History==
Established in 1862 as a teacher training college for the [[Diocese of Lincoln]], it only gained full degree awarding powers in 2006.<ref name="profile">{{cite web | url=http://www.push.co.uk/Uni_Profile.aspx?id=66c8cba2-bb4b-405b-8baa-ae1daf9a23a8&type=profile | title=University profile: Bishop Grosseteste University College | publisher=Push.co.uk | accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> It attracts mature and local students, with 27% of the undergraduate body aged 21 or above at the start of their course, and 50% from  a 30 mile radius.<ref name="profile"/> The courses often include a vocational element and many, but not all, engage with teaching and education subjects <U+2013> of four foundation and nine honours degrees, eight include education-related studies or teaching.<ref name="website">{{cite web | url=http://www.bishopg.ac.uk/?_id=10146 | title=Bishop Grosseteste University College website | publisher=Bishop Grosseteste University College | accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref>

Before 2006, the [[University of Hull]] and later the [[University of Leicester]] validated its qualifications. It was originally known as the 'Diocesan Training School for Mistresses', then 'Lincoln Diocesan Training College' and then 'Bishop Grosseteste College' before becoming a [[university college]] in 2006, finally becoming Bishop Grosseteste University in 2012. The college initially occupied the premises of an earlier, unsuccessful training establishment for male teachers, built in 1842 and still in use.

The college takes its present name from [[Robert Grosseteste]], a 13th century [[Bishop of Lincoln]], theologian and scholar.

In 2008 Dame [[Judith Mayhew]] was made Provost of Bishop Grosseteste University College.

2012 saw a change in Government legislation regarding the use of the university title meaning that higher education establishments with more than 1,000 students can apply for the title. Bishop Grosseteste University College Lincoln applied for the University title in June 2012 and has now been approved to be renamed 'Bishop Grosseteste University'.

==Campus==
{{sect-expand|date=January 2013}}
The university is on a single campus on the outskirts of Lincoln.

An extension to the Library (the Cornerstone building) has recently been completed and has doubled study space available to students and incorporating Student Support services.

===Student accommodation===
There are only 180 places in [[hall of residence|halls of residence]]. although since there is a high proportion of [[mature student]]s and local students, few first years actually need to live in. Those that do tend to live in private houses. No second or third years live in halls.<ref name="profile"/>

The three halls are within a few minutes' walk of each other and the campus.

A new hall of residence, Crosstrend House, a short walk from the University, was refurbished in the summer of 2012, ready for the September 2012 new intake. An overhaul of some of the old halls will be complete by the 2013-14 year.
