'''Tropical Storm Barry''' was a weak and short-lived [[tropical cyclone]] that brought heavy rains to parts of [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]] in June 2013. Barry originated from a [[tropical wave]] that developed in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]]. The wave tracked northwestward and began to develop in marginally favorable conditions. On June&nbsp;17, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Two by the [[National Hurricane Center]]. Due to its close proximity to land, the system failed to intensify before crossing the southern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. The depression emerged over the [[Bay of Campeche]] late on June&nbsp;18 and became increasingly organized. During the afternoon of June&nbsp;19, data from [[Hurricane Hunter]]s revealed the system had intensified into a tropical storm. The newly named Barry attained peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) before making [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[Veracruz]], Mexico on June&nbsp;20. Once onshore, the storm quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low that night.

Areas from northern [[Nicaragua]] to [[South-Central Mexico]] experienced heavy rains from the storm, with notable flooding occurring in many areas. Swollen rivers displaced thousands in [[Veracruz]] and killed two people, while two others were killed by a river in [[Oaxaca]]. In [[El Salvador]], two people were killed by flooding.
