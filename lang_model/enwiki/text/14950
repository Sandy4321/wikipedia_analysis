'''''The Beacon Street Collection''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[USA|American]] [[ska]] and [[rock music|rock]] band [[No Doubt]], released in [[March]] [[1995]] (see [[1995 in music]]). It was [[Independent music|released independently]] by the band under their own record label, Beacon Street Records. It was produced by No Doubt themselves and recorded in a homemade recording studio in the garage of their house on Beacon Street in [[Anaheim]], [[California]], from which the album takes its name.

The album was released during a time in which the band were receiving little attention from their record label, [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], and were not getting a chance to record a second album. Interscope were disillusioned with the band after the commercial failure of their first album, ''[[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|No Doubt]]''. No Doubt had written large numbers of songs and knew that they would not make it onto any Interscope album, so they built their own studio and recorded the album there. Two singles were released from it: "Squeal" and "Doghouse" on 7-inch vinyl.

The album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over three times as many as their first album sold. This success ensured that Interscope financed the band's third album, ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'', which was a massive success, selling 16 million copies worldwide and attracting extensive interest in the band. ''The Beacon Street Collection'' was re-released in [[1997]] as part of the band's back catalog.

==Background==

No Doubt released [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|their self-titled debut album]] in 1992, a year after being signed to [[Interscope records|Interscope]]. The group's blend of upbeat brass-dominated songs and funk-style bass riffs came at a time when most of the [[United States|USA]] was in the thrall of [[grunge music]], a genre whose angst-ridden lyrics and dirty sound could not have contrasted more with the atmosphere of most of the songs on No Doubt's pop-orientated album.<ref name=allmusicalbum>{{allmusic|id=10:ief2zfgheh2k~T0|label=No Doubt (album)}}</ref> Not surprisingly, the band lost out to the now-ubiquitous grunge music and the album was a commercial failure, with only 30,000 copies sold<ref name="ocw">Vineyard, Jennifer.

In the words of the program director of [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], a Californian radio station on which it was one of the band's driving ambitions to be played: "It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio."<ref name=band/><ref>[[Tyrangiel, Josh]].

The band started to work on its second album in 1993 but Interscope, having lost faith in the band, rejected most of its material and so it was paired with producer [[Matthew Wilder]]. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording or rehearsing.  He left No Doubt in 1994 to pursue an animation career on the [[cartoon]] [[TV series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name="btm">"No Doubt".  ''[[Behind the Music]]''.  [[VH1]].

==Music==

A large number of songs on ''The Beacon Street Collection'' were written by [[Eric Stefani]], who left the group before their third album was recorded. This gave the album a similar sound to their first album, ''[[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|No Doubt]]'', in which Eric Stefani had collaborated in the writing of all the songs. Because the songs in ''Tragic Kingdom'' were written mainly by [[Gwen Stefani]] about her experiences in life, the style of music changed from what No Doubt had previously produced. [[Tom Dumont]] explained the change in sound in an interview for Backstage Online:

{{quote|Well, there is a reason that the sound of our music has changed and it's not because we've sold out, easy for me to say. Eric, our keyboard player used to write most of our songs. He was the main creative force in the band for many years. And at a certain point after that first album came out, he had this personal thing, like he didn't like touring, he didn't like all that stuff. He just liked to sit down and write songs. That's him. He's the artistic side, the total Mr. Creative.

Well what happened is when Eric decided to leave the band it left the song writing to us, me, Gwen, Tony, the rest of us and it's a really natural thing for our song writing style to be different than Eric's. Just we're different people. I mean we've learned a lot from him and he taught us a lot of things about song writing, but we write simpler music. We have a simpler style. We're not quite Genius like him I think. This album was our first attempt. it was Gwen's first time really writing all the lyrics herself so to me, it went the opposie from selling out we have done something that is even more personal. In the past, Eric was writing songs about his life and having Gwen sing them. Now we have Gwen singing and writing about her own experiences.<ref>[http://www.nodoubt.com/press/articles/10BackStage.asp Interview with Tom Dumont] by Evan Zelig for Backstage Online on [[October 31]] [[1996]].</ref>}}

===Production===

No Doubt became frustrated at the lack of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band.<ref name=interviewfirst> [http://www.nodoubt.com/press/articles/01Bam.asp Interview with the band], conducted by Wendy Hermanson for BAM magazine on [[November 17]] [[1995]], archived on [[No Doubt]]'s official website.

===Singles===

[[Image:Doghouse.jpg|thumb|right|Cover image for No Doubt's second single from the album, "Doghouse".]]

In 1994, before recording of the album had even began, No Doubt released two [[seven-inch]] [[single (music)|singles]] for their fans. The first was "Squeal", a song written by [[Gwen Stefani]], detailing a criminal's reaction to her partner's betrayal to the police. They had agreed to be "in this together" but, after he "[[plea bargain|squeals]]", she resolves to "kill the [[Informant|narc]] who wrote it and said it [that she was guilty of a crime]". The single's [[B-side]] was "My Room Is Still Clean", written by [[Tony Kanal]] and recorded live at the Icehouse in [[Fullerton, California]] on [[February 13]] [[1993]].<ref name=songs>[http://www.nodoubt.com/music/singles.aspx Squeal and Doghouse] at [[No Doubt]]'s official website.</ref>

The second single was "Doghouse", written by Gwen Stefani. It is about a man who is bullied and dominated by his girlfriend and is unwilling to force the situation to change. The song uses the metaphor of a [[dog]] and its master to illustrate the nature of the relationship, saying that she had got him "by the reins" and he has been "[[Dog training|conditioned]]" by her. The single's B-side was "You Can't Teach An Ol' Dog New Tricks", written by Gwen Stefani.<ref name=songs/>

==Reception==
===Significance===

On its original release in March 1995, ''The Beacon Street Collection'' was only available in local record stores in [[Orange County, California]] and at No Doubt's shows. Its rawer sound proved popular with the band's fans and the band's first batch of one thousand copies sold out within only a few month after its release.<ref name=band/> Interscope realised the band's potential and allowed them to record their third album, ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' in various [[Los Angeles]] [[recording studio|studios]], "wherever they could get a deal on a studio".<ref name=interviewfirst/> During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interesting in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label [[Trauma Records]], which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and ''Tragic Kingdom'' got the personal focus that comes from a small company.<ref name="variety">Sandler, Adam.  [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677862.html?categoryid=16&cs=1 "Interscope facing Trauma in $100 million lawsuit"].  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.  [[May 28]], [[1997]].  Retrieved [[December 30]], [[2006]].</ref>

By the end of the year, 100,000 copies of ''The Beacon Street Collection'' had been sold, over three times as many as their first album, ''[[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|No Doubt]]''.<ref name=band/> These sales were mostly due to the release of ''Tragic Kingdom'', which was released seven months after ''The Beacon Street Collection'' in [[October]] [[1995]]. ''Tragic Kingdom'' was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the [[USA]] and 16 million worldwide<ref name="vogue">Van Meter, Jonathan.

, peaking at number one on several charts and being [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] "diamond" in the US<ref name="RIAA">[http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=No%20Doubt&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 Tragic Kingdom] at [[RIAA certification|RIAA]].</ref> and [[Canada]]<ref>[http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php Tragic Kingdom] at [[Canadian Recording Industry Association|CRIA]].</ref> and "platinum" in the [[UK]]<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/ Tragic Kingdom] at [[BPI Certifications|BPI]].</ref> and [[Australia]]<ref>[http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-1997.htm Tragic Kingdom] at [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]].</ref>. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in [[October]] [[1997]], ''The Beacon Street Collection'' was re-released on [[Interscope Records|Interscope]].<ref name=band/>

In an interview with Axcess Magazine in [[April]] [[1996]], [[Gwen Stefani]] described the release of ''The Beacon Street Collection'' as "one of the best things [they] ever did because [they] were able to take some songs that would have probably gotten lost and document them".<ref name=axcess>[http://www.nodoubt.com/press/articles/07Axcess.asp Bursting into stardom] interview with Axcess Magazine on [[April]]/[[May]] [[1996]].</ref>

===Critical===

[[Allmusic]] called the album "finer than the [band's] [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|debut]]", and described it as containing more of a "raw sound inspired [...] by punk" than the style of No Doubt's first album, which was heavily "[[Sound synthesis|synth]] and [[New Wave music|new wave]]".<ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:vy2ibkg9jak9~T1 The Beacon Street Collection] at [[Allmusic]].</ref> [[Entertainment Weekly]], in 1997, called it "more focused than ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''" with "[[reggae]] frat-house grooves and perky horns", and complimented "[[Gwen Stefani|Gwen's]] feisty Kewpie-doll wail" and the "swaying ballads", attributing it to "the band's willing spirit".<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290280,00.html The Beacon Street Collection] at [[Entertainment Weekly]].</ref> Rock On The Net retrospectively called the album "a raw expression of their sound" and describing it as "80s [[punk rock|punk]] with 90s [[grunge music|grunge]].<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-n/nodoubt_main.htm No Doubt] at [[Rock on the Net]].</ref>
