The '''Royal Gold Cup''' or '''Saint Agnes Cup''' is a solid gold covered cup lavishly decorated with [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and pearls.  It was made for the French royal family at the end of the 14th century, and later belonged to several English monarchs, before spending nearly 300 years in Spain. Since 1892 it has been in the [[British Museum]], and is generally agreed to be the outstanding survival of late medieval French plate.  It has been described as "the one surviving royal magnificence of the [[International Gothic]] age",<ref>Lightbown</ref> and to [[Thomas Hoving]], former director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, "of all the princely jewels and gold that have come down to us, this is the most spectacular<U+2014>and that includes the great royal treasures."<ref>Hoving, 61, calling it the "Saint Agnes Cup"; in French it is always the ''Coupe de Saint Agnes''</ref>  

The cup is made of solid gold, and stands 23.6&nbsp;cm (9.25&nbsp;inches) high, with a diameter of 17.8&nbsp;cm (6.94&nbsp;inches) at its widest point;<ref>"British Museum collection database"</ref> it weighs 1.935&nbsp;kg (4.26&nbsp;lb).<ref>Dalton, 1; Steane, 135</ref>  It has a cover that lifts off, and once stood on a triangular stand, now lost.  The stem of the cup has twice been extended by the addition of cylindrical bands, so that it was originally a good deal shorter,<ref>There are illustrations of the original shape in Dalton's Figure 1 (drawing), and Cherry, p. 24 (edited photo, also in Henderson, 138)</ref> giving the overall shape "a typically robust and stocky elegance."<ref>Lightbown</ref> The original decorated knop or finial on the cover has been lost, and a moulding decorated with 36 pearls has been removed from the outer edge of the cover; a strip of gold with jagged edges can be seen where it was attached.  Presumably it matched the one still in place round the foot of the cup.<ref>Dalton, 1, and Lightbown. See [[Royal Gold Cup#Provenance|Provenance]] section for the missing parts.</ref> 

The gold surfaces are decorated with scenes in ''[[basse-taille]]'' enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have [[engraving|engraved]] and ''[[pointill<U+00E9>]]'' decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition.  This colour, known as ''rouge clair'', was the most difficult to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully.<ref>"British Museum Investigation"</ref> Scenes from the life of [[Saint Agnes]] run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body.  The [[Four Evangelists|symbols of the Four Evangelists]] run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel [[Tudor rose]]s on a [[Diapering|diapered]] pointill<U+00E9> background; this was apparently added under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.<ref>Dalton, 1<U+2013>4; "British Museum collection database"</ref>

The cup came to the British Museum with a custom-made [[hexagonal]] case of leather on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts.  This was either made at the same time or soon after the cup, and has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a [[blackletter]] inscription: ''YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS''.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=48782&partid=1 Wood and leather case] British Museum collection database, accessed June 16, 2010. Registration number:  1892,0501.2</ref>

==Provenance==
There is no firm evidence as to the date and circumstances of the creation of the cup.  It is first clearly documented in an inventory from 1391 of the valuables belonging to [[Charles VI of France]] (reigned 1380<U+2013>1422), surviving in two copies in the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France]].<ref>Dalton, 8<U+2013>9. The inventories are BnF Mss Fr 21445 (f.1b) and 21446 (f.45b)</ref> This lists: 
<blockquote>A [[hanaper|hanap]] of gold, all its cover well and richly enamelled on the outside with the life of Madame St Agnes; and the cresting of the foot is garnished with 26 pearls, and the crown around the cover with 36 pearls; and the finial of the said cover  (is) garnished with four sapphires, three [[Spinel|balas rubies]] and fifteen pearls. And it weighs 9 [[Mark (mass)|marcs]] 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold in the form of a tripod, and in the middle of the tripod is represented Our Lord in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of the tripod are formed by three winged dragons.  The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into [[Touraine]] in the year 91.<ref>Translation from Dalton, 8<U+2013>9. Crucially, the number of pearls around the foot agrees with the current number. A "marc" is approximately 249 [[gram]]s, so allowing for the changes to the cup, the weight given is consistent.  The stand weighed 3 marcs and 5 1/2 ounces.</ref></blockquote>
[[Image:Dzhon Lankasterskiy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], kneeling, was the first English owner of the cup. Detail from a miniature by the [[Bedford Master]]]]

[[John, Duke of Berry|Jean, duc de Berry]] (1340<U+2013>1416) was Charles VI's uncle and a powerful figure in the kingdom, as well as the most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day.  He is still best known for commissioning the ''[[Tr<U+00E8>s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', the famous International Gothic [[illuminated manuscript]], and also commissioned the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], now in the British Museum.<ref>Cherry, 39<U+2013>43</ref>  The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations.<ref>Dalton, 9</ref>  Lavish gifts among the [[House of Valois|Valois]] court circle were routine,<ref>The subject of Buettner's article; Cherry, 47, gives alarming statistics</ref> and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous. 

The cup next appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]] (1389<U+2013>1435), son of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].  How he acquired the cup is not known, but he would have received many gifts from Charles VI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the [[Louvre Palace|Palais du Louvre]], in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] his heir.  After the death of his brother Henry V, Bedford [[Hundred Years' War (1415<U+2013>1429)|struggled to stem]] the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by [[Joan of Arc]].  He died in [[Normandy]] in 1435, leaving Henry VI as his heir.<ref>Dalton, 10</ref>  The cup is the first item in a list of valuables received from Bedford's estate prepared for Henry VI's minister Cardinal [[Henry Beaufort]], although for some reason it does not appear in a royal inventory of 1441.<ref>Dalton, 8. It is the only surviving piece of metalwork from the list, according to Buettner</ref>  Perhaps this was because it had been pawned, as it was in 1449 and again in 1451, on both occasions to finance England's [[Hundred Years' War#French victory: 1429<U+2013>1453|increasingly unsuccessful efforts]] to hold on to French territory.<ref name="D8">Dalton, 8</ref>

It first appears in records of the new [[Tudor dynasty]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1521.  By now the cover had lost the finial "garnished with four sapphires, three balas rubies and fifteen pearls" described in Charles VI's inventory and had a new one of gold in the form of a closed, or "imperial" crown.  This matches a propaganda drive at this time by Henry to assert England as an "empire", a contemporary sense meaning a state recognising no superior.  Other uses had probably been found for the jewels of the old finial; it is assumed that the lower band with the Tudor roses was added in Henry's reign.<ref>Dalton, 1,8</ref>  The cup is described in inventories in 1532 and after Henry's death in 1547, and then under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] it was inventoried in 1574 and 1596.<ref name="D8" />

When [[James I of England|James I]] succeeded to the English throne in 1603, one of his first priorities was to end the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], which had been dragging on since 1585.  A Spanish delegation arrived for the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Somerset House Conference]], which concluded with a treaty signed in 1604.  The leader of the [[Habsburg]] diplomats was [[Juan Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Velasco, 5th Duke of Fr<U+00ED>as]] and [[Constable of Castile]].  The upper extension to the stem of the cup has a Latin inscription that translates as:
<blockquote>This cup of solid gold, a relic of the sacred treasure of England and a memorial to the peace made between the kings, the Constable Juan de Velasco, returning thence after successfully accomplishing his mission, presented as an offering to Christ the Peacemaker.<ref>Translation "British Museum collection database". Dalton has the reading "sacred (royal) treasure", p. 5.</ref></blockquote>

The gift of "some 70 items of silver and gold plate" by James to the Constable, of which the cup was the most notable item, is documented on both the English and Spanish sides;<ref>Ungerer, quoted here, has details and references</ref> the Constable wrote an account of his mission on his return, which mentions the gift from James.  The Constable had previously presented both James and the queen with elaborate cups, among other valuable gifts.<ref name="D6">Dalton, 6. Ungerer describes several surviving [[bills of exchange]]; most of the Spanish gifts were bought in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].</ref>  According to Pauline Croft, "With his usual over-generosity the king gave the departing envoys around half the large gold vessels from the royal possessions he had inherited from Elizabeth. The Constable himself received a stupendous gift of plate, including possibly the most venerable item in the collection, known as "the Royal Gold Cup of the Kings of France and England."<ref>Croft</ref>  In 1610 the Constable gave the cup to a convent in [[Medina de Pomar]], near [[Burgos]], as the inscription describes.  His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent.  A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained the permission of the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] for the cup to be used as a [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], or container for consecrated [[Sacramental bread|hosts]].  By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.<ref name="D6" />  
[[File:Royal Gold Cup base.jpg|thumb|left|The stem and foot of the cup, showing the added bands]]

The cup stayed in the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. They decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was entrusted to a priest who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current [[Duke of Fr<U+00ED>as]], who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.<ref name="D6" />  

The duke eventually lost his case in 1891, enabling a further sale that had been set up by Baron Pichon to proceed.  This was to the leading firm of Messrs. Wertheimer of [[Bond Street]] in London,<ref name="D6" /><ref>See also [http://jssgallery.org/Essay/Wertheimer_Family/JM_Intro.htm The Wertheimer Family], from the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]].</ref>  where the cup was seen by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], who had been Keeper of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography at the British Museum since 1866, and was president of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]].  Samson Wertheimer agreed "with much public spirit" to sell the cup to the British Museum for the <U+00A3>8,000 it had cost the firm.<ref name="D6" />  Franks was worried by the new American collectors such as [[J. P. Morgan]], and in 1891 wrote to Sir [[Henry Tate]], of [[Tate Gallery]] fame: "A very wonderful gold cup has appeared returned to this country after an absence of 287 years, and I am anxious to see it placed in the National Museum and not removed to America."<ref>Wilson, 175</ref>  He tried to get wealthy individuals to subscribe <U+00A3>500 each, but even with a grant of <U+00A3>2,000 from [[HM Treasury]] could not raise the price.  He was forced to put up <U+00A3>5,000 of his own money temporarily while he continued to try to get smaller amounts from others, and succeeded in 1892 when the Treasury agreed to contribute the final <U+00A3>830; "to Franks this was his greatest acquisition, and the one of which he was most proud."<ref>Wilson, 175<U+2013>176 (quotation, 176).</ref>  Apart from the Treasury, the <U+00A3>500 contributors were Franks and Wertheimer, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], [[Fortnum & Mason|Charles Drury Edward Fortnum]], the [[Algernon Percy, 6th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], [[John Savile, 1st Baron Savile of Rufford|Lord Savile]], [[Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Lord Iveagh]] and the [[James Ludovic Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]].<ref>Dalton, 6; he lists some donors of smaller amounts.  See also Wilson, 175<U+2013>176 for more detail on the timing. Samson Wertheimer died in 1892, and the sale was actually concluded by his son Asher and other heirs, and the donation by them in his memory.</ref>

==Creation, context and survival==
[[File:Les Tr<U+00E8>s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Berry at a feast for New Year, when gifts were exchanged among his court. To the left there is a ''buffet'' displaying plate, and two courtiers beside it seem to be comparing gifts. January from the calendar of ''[[Les Tr<U+00E8>s Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', by the [[Limbourg Brothers]].]]  
Much the most prominent decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes from the life of Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King [[Charles V of France]], Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father.  Charles V was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' [[feast day]], January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory).<ref>Lightbown, and Dalton, 10</ref>  Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381.  When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to Charles VI.<ref>Dalton, 10; Cherry, 25</ref>  

However in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the [[V&A Museum]], rejected this theory on stylistic grounds, considering that the cup must have been created only shortly before it appeared in Charles VI's inventory in 1391.<ref>Lightbown, in 1978.  The old view is presented in Dalton, 10</ref> He says that "in 1380 figure-style was a softly undulating, flowing style, with slender elongated figures and much use of serpentine or curving folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses ending in sinuous Gothic hem-lines"<ref>Lightbown</ref> <U+2014>a style that can be seen in the miniature of the coronation of Charles VI in 1380 illustrated above.  In contrast, Lightbown says "the figures on the cup are broad, some might even be called stocky, with soft drapery of cylindrical form, or of smooth, tight outlines. The folds are tubular and the hems of the robes are straight with no waving, trailing outlines. The style in fact is the 'Italianate' manner which developed in France as a result of contact with '[[trecento]]' art, and not the purely Northern Gothic International manner."<ref>Lightbown</ref>  Whether it was intended from the start as a gift to Charles, and why the life of Saint Agnes was chosen as a subject, are left unclear in this new theory.  John Cherry, the former Keeper of the medieval collections at the British Museum, still presents the older dating in a work of 2010.<ref>Cherry, 25, and biography on rear cover. The "British Museum Highlights" page says "about AD 1370<U+2013>80", while the "British Museum collection database" web page says "1390 (circa)"</ref>

Another traditional assumption, shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a ''buffet'' beside it;<ref>Sir Charles Hercules Read (see further reading), in 1904, quoted in Dalton, 1; Steane, 135; Lightbown; Buettner; and others.</ref>  The ''buffet'' of the period was more like a modern [[Welsh dresser]] or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use.<ref>Steane, 135</ref>  Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently.<ref>Lightbown</ref>  However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including those on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start.<ref>Cherry, 25</ref> It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the ''Saint Chapelle'' at his capital of [[Bourges]], intended to rival the king's ''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]'' in Paris and his brother's foundation at [[Champmol]] in [[Dijon]].<ref>Cherry, 41 on Berry's castles, and 43<U+2013>44 on the Bourges ''Saint Chapelle''.</ref> 

The four sons of King [[John II of France]]<U+2014>Charles V, [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou]] (1339<U+2013>1384), Berry and [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]] (1342<U+2013>1404)<U+2014>all spent huge sums on works in gold and silver, as well as on other works of art.  Although it is Berry who is especially remembered as a patron, partly because he specialized in illuminated manuscripts which have little value in their materials, his brother Louis of Anjou had over 3,000 pieces of plate at one point.  These included wholly secular pieces with sculptures in enamel that can only be imagined by comparison to the handful of [[reliquaries]], like the British Museum's [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], that have survived from the period.<ref>Henderson, 134<U+2013>139; Snyder, 16<U+2013>17, and chapter 3 on the patronage of the brothers</ref>  However in 1381 Anjou melted down almost all his plate to finance a war to pursue his claim to the [[Kingdom of Naples]].  According to the sculptor and goldsmith [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], writing seventy years later, one of Anjou's goldsmiths, called Gusmin and "a most skillful sculptor, of great talent", was so affected by the destruction of his life's work that he joined a [[Hermit|eremetic monastic order]] and lived out his days in silence.<ref>Henderson, 136, Buettner. Ghiberti does not make it entirely clear which Duke of Anjou Gusmin worked for; it might also have been Duke Louis I's son, [[Louis II of Naples]] or grandson [[Louis III of Naples]], who all pursued their claims to Naples, with Louis I and III dying in Italy.</ref> The Royal Gold Cup was "probably not exceptional as to size or decoration" in this milieu; once "but one member of a class, it now stands alone".  An inventory of Charles V records 25 gold cups weighing between five and fifteen ''marcs''; this is slightly over nine without its stand.<ref>Dalton, 11</ref>  Smaller gold cups are recorded in sets of a dozen, of which Charles V had three.  The largest items were the great table ornaments, in the shape of ships, called [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]], of which Charles V had five, the heaviest weighing over 53&nbsp;''marcs''.<ref>Dalton, 11. The duc de Berry has a nef on his table in the illustration above, and two of Charles V's can be seen on the table [[:File:Grandes Chroniques-entremet.jpg|here]]</ref>  

Berry died in 1416 with no male heir, and deeply in debt.  Those of his works in precious metal and jewels that had not already gone to his creditors were mostly seized by the English when they took Paris in July 1417.<ref>Cherry, 47<U+2013>48</ref>  This was the first of a number of periods that saw the large-scale destruction of goldsmiths' work that the cup escaped, but thousands of other pieces did not, a survival that Brigitte Buettner finds "almost miraculous".<ref>Buettner</ref>  In particular, the move to Spain in 1604 enabled it to avoid the dispersal and destruction of the [[English Crown Jewels]] and royal collection of plate under the [[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]].<ref name="D6" /> 
[[Image:M<U+00E9>rode Cup.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[silver-gilt]] [[M<U+00E9>rode Cup]], about 1400 ([[Victoria and Albert museum|V&A Museum]]).]]

As a secular piece the cup would be an almost unique survival at this level of quality, "the one representative left to us of medieval secular plate in its most sumptuous development".<ref>Sir Charles Hercules Read (see further reading), in 1904, quoted, Dalton, 1</ref>  Although French plate in silver and gold was made in great quantities, and at a high level of quality, "French silver made prior to the early 19th century is probably scarcer than that of any other European country."<ref>Osbourne, 726,</ref>  The cost of even very skilled labour was low compared to that of the materials, and in the absence of any reliable way of either depositing or investing money, it was turned into lavish objects, in the knowledge that it might well need to be sold or melted down to finance some future project.  If it survived long enough to become old-fashioned it was likely to be melted down and remodelled in a new style.<ref>Osbourne, 726; Campbell, 163; Steane, 134, writing about England</ref>  

There are only four other known survivals, secular or religious, of ''basse taille'' enamel on gold, one the small [[George Salting|Salting]] [[Reliquary]], also in the British Museum, and none as fine as the cup.<ref>Dalton, 11. The [http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/r/reliquary_pendant,_holy_thorn.aspx "Salting Reliquary"], British Museum Highlights, accessed, June 16, 2010.</ref>  The "King John Cup" in [[King's Lynn]], of ca. 1340, [[silver-gilt]] with transparent enamel, is the best example of ''basse-taille'' work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection."<ref>"Maryon (1971)"</ref> However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original.<ref>"Maryon (1971)", 187; ([http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/images/Regalia%2007.jpg Poor image of King John Cup from West Norfolk Council]). See Campbell, 435<U+2013>436, with good photo and full catalogue entry; Osbourne, 333.  Four restorations and re-enamellings between 1692 and 1782 are recorded in inscriptions under the base <U+2013> see Campbell.</ref>  The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt [[M<U+00E9>rode Cup]] of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of ''plique <U+00E1> jour'' enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass.<ref>Ward, 189</ref>

==Iconography==
[[File:Royal Gold Cup lid.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first scene on the cover; Procopius offers Agnes a casket of jewels. Parts of the next scene can be seen at right, and her martyrdom at left.]] 

The cycle of scenes from the life of Saint Agnes, and that of her foster-sister [[Saint Emerentiana]],  follows the traditional story of ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]]; the most popular compilation of [[hagiographies]] of the age, whose wording corresponds to some of the inscriptions in [[banderole]]s or scrolls that explain the scenes; others are quotations from the Latin [[Vulgate]] bible, mostly derived from the [[liturgy]] for St Agnes' feast day.<ref>Lightbown; Cowling, 32 note 30. See Caxton reference for an online English translation of the ''Golden Legend''.</ref>  It seems likely that [[clergy|clerical]] advice was taken, at least over the texts used in the inscriptions.<ref>Lightbown</ref>   It is tempting to relate the depiction of the story, with its "distinct and vivid tableaux, well suited to adaptation for performance" to [[medieval drama]], often a source for [[iconography]], but the fragmentary records mention no dramas on the life of St Agnes that are close in time or place to the origin of the cup.<ref>Quotation from Cowling, 27. On plays specifically about St Agnes, see Cowling, 19, 24, 27<U+2013>28.  On links between religious art and drama more generally, see Lane, especially 47<U+2013>59.</ref>  

Agnes and her sister were virgins of Rome in the time of the Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], yet all figures are shown in contemporary 14th-century dress.<ref>Lightbown; "British Museum collection database" has good images allowing all scenes to be seen, but they have no stable links.</ref>  The story begins on the inside of the bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]].  She holds a book inscribed ''Miserere mei Deus sancte'' ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says ''In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi'' ("Thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee". {{bibleverse||Psalms|119:11|KJV}}).<ref>Lightbown; the scene is of course not visible to visitors, but there is a photo on the "British Museum collection database", and in Lightbown, and Dalton's Figure 3 has a drawing. All biblical quotations are given in Latin and English per Lightbown (English version unknown), while the links are to the [[Authorized Version]] (aka "KJV"). The Vulgate text can be accessed via the link by changing the version at the top of the page.</ref>  The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' [[martyrdom]] in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function.  Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.  

[[File:British Museum Royal Gold Cup Detail.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The first scene underneath the bowl, in which Agnes is buried]]
In the first scene the two girls are returning from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning [[emblem|attribute]],<ref>The ''Golden Legend'' explains, in Caxton's version, "Agnes is said of agna a lamb, for she was humble and debonair as a lamb, or of agnos in Greek, which is to say debonair and piteous, for she was debonair and merciful. Or Agnes of agnoscendo, for she knew the way of truth, and after this [[Saint Augustine|St. Austin]] saith, truth is opposed against vanity, falseness, and doubleness, for these three things were taken from her for the truth that she had."</ref> a [[domestic sheep|lamb]] with a cruciform [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and carrying a martyr's [[Arecaceae|palm]].  They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the [[Prefect of Rome]], who has fallen in love with Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him.  The inside of the casket is white and the only area of opaque enamel in the original work.<ref>Apart from the tiny area of the host held by Christ on the inside of the cover.  Cherry, 26</ref>  Agnes, not being a Valois, rejects him, with the words ''Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt'' ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above.  The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a [[brothel]] for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].  She stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been struck dead and has a devil crouched over him; a banderole reads ''Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris'' ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12|KJV}}), and the Prefect looks on sadly.<ref>Lightbown</ref>

[[File:Royal Gold Cup with flash.JPG|thumb|300px|On the cover, the second scene with Agnes outside the brothel and Procopius lying dead. Below, the pagans stone [[Emerentiana]], and on the foot the winged [[ox]], symbol of [[Saint Luke]].]]

In the next scene Agnes has been moved by the Prefect's grief, and prays for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done.  The repentent Procopius kneels before her, while she leans down to tell him ''Vade amplius noli peccare'' ("Go forth and sin no more"; from {{bibleverse||John|8:11|KJV}}).  However the result of the miracle was that (in [[William Caxton]]'s translation) "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits".  The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from {{bibleverse||Luke|23:4|KJV}} ''Nihil invenio cause in eam'' ("I find no cause against her") above.  The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear.<ref>In fact a sword in the ''Golden Legend'', Lightbown.</ref>  Her last words, from {{bibleverse||Luke|23:46|KJV}}, are ''In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam'' ("Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").

The scenes continue on the underside of the bowl, starting with Agnes' burial.  A [[pall (funeral)|pall]] is being laid over her [[sarcophagus]], whose red enamel has significant losses, which reveal clearly the engraved lines beneath. A [[tonsure]]d priest with an [[Aspergillum|aspergil]] for sprinkling [[holy water]] and an [[acolyte]] with a cross attend, with Emerentiana with halo to the left, and Agnes' mother to the right.  The banderole above says ''Ecce quod concupivi iam teneo'' ("Behold what I have desired I now possess"). In the next scene pagans have arrived to disrupt the burial, and only Emerentia has stayed, kneeling in prayer as she is pelted with rocks. The inscription reads ''Veni soror mea mecum in gloria'' ("Come with me my sister into glory").  She dies, and the following scene shows the two martyrs, accompanied by two other unnamed female martyrs (in the source "a great multitude of virgins clad in vestments of gold and silver"),<ref>Lightbown and Caxton</ref> as they appear in a vision to Agnes' friends eight days after her death, as they gather round her sarcophagus, into which Emerentia's body has also been placed.  

The next scene shows the sarcophagus with [[Constantina]], the daughter of the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown.<ref>Constantina developed a medieval legend, and was venerated as a saint, Saint Constance in English. See Kleinhenz, Christopher, ed.; [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1piMMqjAf1MC&pg=PA251&dq=Vita+%22Saint+Agnes%22&hl=en&ei=u4IiTL0iw4g4tcbhiwU&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Vita%20%22Saint%20Agnes%22&f=false ''Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Volume 1]'', Routledge, 2004. ISBN 0-4159-3930-5</ref>  She has been afflicted with [[leprosy]], and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there.  The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying ''Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis'' ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source).<ref>Lightbown, who gives the Latin from the source.</ref>  In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription ''Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium'' ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").<ref>Lightbown</ref>

The inside of the cover has a circular enamel medallion with worked gold borders, showing a half-length Christ making a blessing gesture and holding a [[chalice]] with a host inside. Around him is a sun-like [[aureole]] in red.  Below the two added cylinders on the stem, the four traditional [[Evangelist's symbol|symbols of the Evangelists]] run round the sloping foot of the cup, in pairs facing each other, above a green ground area.  Lightbown notes this as "another sign of care for naturalistic effect".<ref>Lightbown</ref>

==Construction and techniques==

Each of the cover, main body, and foot of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the enamelled medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment.  The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings.  A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names.  Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou.<ref>Nash, 44</ref>   High quality courtly work like the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris in the absence of other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.<ref>Cherry, 25; Osbourne, 726; Lightbown</ref>   

[[File:Medallion bull St Luke MNMA Cl14719.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A 14th century silver plaque in ''[[basse-taille]]'' with translucent enamels, with considerable losses, showing the prepared metal surfaces beneath, and the tinting with different colours.]]

The process for creating the ''[[basse-taille]]'' enamel areas began by marking the outline of the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a "tracer".  Then the interior area was worked with [[Repouss<U+00E9> and chasing|chasing tools]], hammering and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel.  The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight.  In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly.  In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used.  Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way.  Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.<ref>Lightbown. Maryon (1951) <U+2013> see further reading <U+2013> and his colleagues established the method for making the recesses; Read and Dalton had thought they were all cut out with [[chisel]]s.  For other objects with translucent enamels, see Campbell, 458<U+2013>461.</ref>  

The enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired.  Different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of [[gum tragacanth]] before adding the next.  The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area.  This is especially used on "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees.  Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin.  The ''rouge clair'' or "ruby glass" red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of [[copper]], silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used.  After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal, which was presumably decorated last.  The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans, but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th&nbsp;century.  The added cylinders use opaque enamel.<ref>"British Museum Investigation"; Lightbown; Maryon (1971), 188; Osbourne, 333</ref>  Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.<ref>Osbourne, 333</ref>
