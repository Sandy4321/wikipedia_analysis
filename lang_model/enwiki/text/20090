==History==
The church is built of the site of a [[monastery]] which was established about 560 by St&nbsp;Dunawd, the first abbot of the monastery.  The monastery was destroyed in about 616 by [[<U+00C6>thelfrith of Northumbria]] when 1,200 monks were killed and only 50 escaped.  No trace of this monastery exists.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/FLN/Bangor/| title = Bangor Is-coed / Bangor-on-Dee (Bangor Monachorum)| accessdate = 15&nbsp;June 2009 | publisher = [[GENUKI]]}}</ref>

In about 1300 a [[sandstone]] church was built on the site of the monastery.  The chancel from this building is still extant.  The church was restored between 1723 and 1726 by Richard Trubshaw; this restoration included the [[bell tower]].  The north aisle was altered in 1832.<ref name=open>{{Citation | url = http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/assets/pdfs/open_church_network/st_dunawds.pdf| title = St Dunawd's Church| accessdate = 15&nbsp;June 2009| publisher = The Open Church Network}}</ref>  The architect [[John Douglas (architect)|John Douglas]] was married in the church in 1860 and in 1868 he carried out a restoration of the church.<ref name=hubb>{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard | coauthors = | title =The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd |edition= | publisher =Penguin | date = 1986| location =London | pages = 320&ndash;321 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0 14 071052 3 }}</ref> This included the extension of the south aisle to form a [[baptistery]]<ref name=open/> and restoration of the chancel.<ref name=bio>{{cite book | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard |  title =The Work of John Douglas |edition= | publisher =[[The Victorian Society]] | date =1991 | location =London | page = 240 | isbn =0 901657 16 6 }}</ref>  Douglas carried out a further restoration in 1877 which included the addition of a [[timber framing|half-timbered]] porch.<ref name=hubb/>  In 1913 the vestry was built and the organ was repositioned.<ref name=open/>
