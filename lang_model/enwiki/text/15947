'''Laurent''', [[Marquess|marquis]] '''de Gouvion Saint-Cyr''' ([[April 13]], [[1764]] &ndash; [[March 17]], [[1830]]) was a [[France|French]] a commander in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] who rose to the rank of [[Marshal of France]].

==Biography==
===Early life and Revolutionary Wars===
Born in [[Toul]], he went to [[Rome]] at the age of eighteen in order to study painting, but, although he continued his artistic studies after his return to [[Paris]] in [[1784]], he never adopted the profession of a painter. In [[1792]] he was chosen a [[captain]] in a volunteer battalion, and served on the staff of [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|General Custine]]. Promotion rapidly followed, and in the course of two years he became a general of division. In [[1796]] he commanded the centre division of [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]]'s army in the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1796|campaign of the Rhine]], aiding in the celebrated retreat from [[Bavaria]] to the [[Rhine]].

In [[1798]] he succeeded [[Andr<U+00E9> Mass<U+00E9>na]] in the command of the [[French Revolutionary Army|army of Italy]]. In the following year he commanded the left wing of [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]'s army fighting in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]]; when Jourdan was succeeded by Mass<U+00E9>na, he joined the army of Moreau in Italy, where he distinguished himself in face of the great difficulties that followed the [[Battle of Novi|defeat of Novi]]. When Moreau, in [[1800]], was appointed to the command of the army of the Rhine, Gouvion Saint-Cyr was named his principal lieutenant, and on [[May 9]] gained a victory over [[Baron P<U+00E1>l Kray|General Kray]] at [[Biberach an der Ri<U+00DF>|Biberach]]. He was not, however, on good terms with his commander and retired to France after the first operations of the campaign.

In [[1801]] he was sent to [[Spain]] to command the army intended for the invasion of [[Portugal]] (''see [[Peninsular War]]''), and was named grand officer of the [[Legion of Honour]]. When a treaty of peace was shortly afterwards concluded with Portugal, he succeeded [[Lucien Bonaparte]] as ambassador at [[Madrid]]. 

===Empire===
In [[1803]] he was appointed to the command of an army corps in Italy, in 1805 he served with distinction under Mass<U+00E9>na, and in 1806 was engaged in the campaign in southern Italy. He took part [[Fourth Coalition|1807 campaigns]] in [[Prussia]] and [[Poland]], and in 1808, in which year he was made a [[count]], he commanded an army [[corps]] in [[Catalonia]]; but, not wishing to comply with certain orders he received from [[Paris]], he resigned his command and remained in disgrace till [[1811]].

He was still a ''[[G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral|g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral de division]]'', having been excluded from the first list of marshals owing to his action in refusing to influence the troops in favour of the establishment of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. On the opening of the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], Saint-Cyr received command of an army corps, and on [[August 18]], [[1812]] obtained a victory over the Russians at [[Polotsk]], in recognition of which he was created a marshal. He received a severe wound in one of the actions during the general retreat. Saint-Cyr distinguished himself at the [[battle of Dresden]] (August 26-27, 1813) and in the defence of that place against the [[Sixth Coalition|Allies]] after the [[battle of Leipzig]], capitulating only on [[November 11]], when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had retreated to the Rhine.

===Last years===
On the [[Bourbon Restoration]] he was created a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]], and in July [[1815]] was appointed [[List of Defense Ministers of France|War Minister]], but resigned his office in the following November. In June [[1817]] he was appointed [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Navy Minister]], and in September again resumed the duties of War Minister, which he continued to discharge till November [[1819]]. During this time he initiated many reforms, particularly in respect of measures tending to make the army a national rather than a [[House of Bourbon|dynastic]] force. He made efforts to safeguard the rights of veteran soldiers of the Empire, organized the [[General Staff]], and revised the code of [[military law]] and the [[pension]] regulations. He was made a [[marquess]] in [[1817]].

Although Gouvion Saint-Cyr has been complimented by Napoleon for his "''military genius''", his initial lack of obedience meant that he was only assigned independent command in secondary theatres of war. He never lost a battle.
