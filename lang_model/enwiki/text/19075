'''Jennie Goldstien''' (1896-1960), Yiddish theater actress and singer.

==Early Life==
Goldstein was born in New York; her father was a butcher. When she was 6, actress Rosa Margulies noticed her pretty voice and drew her into child roles at the Windsor Theater, including ''Hanele di neytorin (Hannah the seamstress)'' with [[Bertha Kalish]]. Having made a good impression, Jennie was soon making $9 a week. She went to Kenny Liptsin in the Thalia Theater and played in [[Jacob Mikhailovich Gordin]]'s <U+05E9><U+05D4><U+05E8><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05DE><U+05E9><U+05E4><U+05D7><U+05D4> ''Family Purity'' -- for which [[Sigmund Mogulesko]] wrote her the song ''Oyf yener zayt (On the other side)'' -- and ''Der umbakanter (The stranger)''.<ref name=zalmen>Zalmen Zylbercweig, ''Leksikon fun Yidishn teater'', Book one, 378</ref>

At the age of 13 she began to play adult roles for Max R. Veyner, her first being [[Joseph Lateiner|Yoysef Lateyner]]'s ''Dos Yidishe harts (the Jewish heart)''. She moved to Clinton Street Vaudeville in 1909. She met Max Gabel (Gebil) there and married him when she was sixteen years old.<ref name=berger>http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/goldstein-jennie Bio by Shulamith Z. Berger</ref> 
Gebel wrote melodramas in which the couple starred, including ''Alts far libe (Everything for love)'' and ''Kol shofar (voice of the shofar)'', specially written for her. The shows were popular and the couple played in Winnipeg and then in the Lipson Theater and the Grand Music Hall and Peoples Theater where she and Gebil were co-directors. In 1924 she toured in London and the American provinces. She wrote lyrics for some of her songs, recording them for radio and phonograph recordings.<ref name=zalmen />

Goldstein and Gabel divorced in 1930; she subsequently managed the Prospect Theater in the Bronx in 1932<U+2013>1933. She married lawyer Charles W. Groll in May 1936. She starred in her only film role, ''Tsvey shvester (Two Sisters)'' in 1939.

==Later career==

Jennie Goldstein was known for playing unhappy heroines and, later, their mothers:

<blockquote>"There was the tragedienne Jennie Goldstein wringing her heart and wracking her sob-filled voice as she repeated the travails of the innocent immigrant girl seduced by the villainies of the cruel and heartless New York sweatshop world."<ref>Daniel Bell, New York Magazine March 8, 1971, p. 32</ref></blockquote>

However, during the 1940s she also became a comedienne. She played at Jewish organizational functions, performed in two Broadway shows in the 1950s, and appeared on television. Jennie Goldstein died in New York City on February 9, 1960.<ref name=berger />
