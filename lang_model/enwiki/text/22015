'''Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge''' ({{IPAc-en|local|k|e<U+026A>|p|<U+0259>n}} {{respell|KAY|p<U+0259>n}}), formerly known as '''South Branch Bridge''' and '''Romney Bridge''', is a historic [[Truss bridge#Whipple truss|Whipple truss]] bridge located off Carpers Pike ([[West Virginia Route 259]]) on the [[Cacapon River]] in [[Capon Lake, West Virginia|Capon Lake]], [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. The bridge formerly carried Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) over the Cacapon River, thus connecting [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]] with Capon Lake. Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is the oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge in West Virginia, and is the oldest extant metal truss bridge in the state.

The bridge's [[Truss bridge#Whipple truss|Whipple truss]] technology was developed by civil engineer [[Squire Whipple]] in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by designing the first truss bridge with pinned [[eyebar]] connections. The Whipple truss design of Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal cords, and is therefore considered a Whipple<U+2013>Murphy truss bridge. 

Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple truss bridge conveying the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] ([[U.S. Route 50]]) across the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]] near [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. The Whipple truss bridge replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1874, T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple truss bridge over the South Branch, and it served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937.

The Whipple truss bridge was dismantled in 1937 and relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was preserved in place by the West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 15, 2011.

== History ==
=== Whipple truss development === 
[[File:Squire Whipple.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Squire Whipple]]]]
The bridge's [[Truss bridge#Whipple truss|Whipple truss]] technology was developed by civil engineer [[Squire Whipple]] in 1847; the same year in which he received a patent for the design from the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]].<ref name = "Knoblock1">{{Harvnb|Knoblock|2012|p=33.}}</ref><ref name = "Fint5">{{Harvnb|Fint|2011|p=7 of the PDF file.}}</ref> Whipple was one of the inaugural structural engineers to utilize scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures for the development of bridge design, and his groundbreaking book ''A Work on Bridge Building'' (1847) had a significant influence on bridge engineering.<ref name = "Knoblock1"/><ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Fischetti1">{{Harvnb|Fischetti|2009|p=219.}}</ref> Whipple<U+2019>s truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard [[Truss bridge#Pratt truss|Pratt truss]], thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays.<ref name = "Fint5"/> Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned [[eyebar]] connections, which utilized pins instead of [[trunnion]]s.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Tyrrell1">{{Harvnb|Tyrrell|1911|p=169.}}</ref> Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges.<ref name = "Fint5"/> In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both [[wrought iron]] tension and compression components and [[cast iron]] joint blocks and pedestals.<ref name = "Johnson1">{{Harvnb|Johnson|Bryan|Turneaure|Kinne|1910|p=12.}}</ref><ref name = "Tyrrell2">{{Harvnb|Tyrrell|1911|p=33.}}</ref> Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Johnson2">{{Harvnb|Johnson|Bryan|Turneaure|Kinne|1910|p=13.}}</ref>

The technological design advances by Whipple and Murphy, in addition to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States.<ref name = "Fint5"/> The Whipple truss design of Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal cords, and is therefore considered a Whipple<U+2013>Murphy truss bridge.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Johnson2"/> At the time of the bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance.<ref name = "Fint3"/><ref name = "Knoblock3">{{Harvnb|Knoblock|2012|p=48.}}</ref> These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams.<ref name = "Knoblock3"/> Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible and more expedient to construct than stone bridges, and could also span longer distances and provide more durability than wooden bridges.<ref name = "Fint3"/> They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be disassembled and re-erected.<ref name = "Fint3"/> The technology utilized by Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia.<ref name = "Fint3"/> While the Whipple truss bridge lessened in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, as was the case with the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.<ref name = "Fint1"/><ref name = "Knoblock2">{{Harvnb|Knoblock|2012|p=34.}}</ref>

=== South Branch Bridge ===
[[File:1838 Romney Bridge 1874.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1838 covered bridge over the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]] destroyed during the [[American Civil War]], looking east toward [[Sycamore Dale]].]]
Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was originally constructed in 1874 as part of the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple truss bridge conveying the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] ([[U.S. Route 50]]) across the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]] {{convert|0.57|mi|km}} west of [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]].<ref name = "Fint1"/><ref name = "Fint3">{{Harvnb|Fint|2011|p=6 of the PDF file.}}</ref>

The 1874 Whipple truss bridge across the South Branch replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that had been chartered by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] during the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike.<ref name = "Fint3"/> Prior to the construction of the covered bridge in 1838, a public ferry conveyed traffic across the river. [[Isaac Parsons (Virginia politician)|Isaac Parsons]] (1752<U+2013>1796) operated the ferry, known as "Parson's Ferry," following an act of the Virginia General Assembly establishing the ferry in October 1786.<ref name = "VHD1">{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1828|p=56}}</ref><ref name = "Hening2">{{Harvnb|Hening|1823|pp=403<U+2013>404.}}</ref> The 1838 covered bridge remained in use until it was destroyed by retreating [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name = "Fint3"/> Throughout the course of the war, Romney reportedly changed hands 56 times between Confederate and [[Union Army|Union]] forces, and the crossing of the South Branch Potomac River served as a strategic point due to its position along the Northwestern Turnpike, an important east<U+2013>west route.<ref name = "Fint3"/><ref name = "FWP1">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=62.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=549.}}</ref>

Following the conclusion of the war, nearly all bridges along the Northwestern Turnpike had been destroyed, including the South Branch Bridge.<ref name = "FWP2">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=67.}}</ref> In order to restore local businesses and industry, Hampshire County citizens called a mass meeting and steps were taken at the local level to proceed with the construction of new bridges.<ref name = "FWP2"/> Local citizens and the ''South Branch Intelligencer'' newspaper of Romney campaigned for the immediate replacement of the bridge because of "continual risk, danger and inconveniences arising from want of the South Branch Bridge at [[Sycamore Dale|Col.

B. White and Sons, also known as Penn Bridge and Machine Works, in [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]] were charged with the bridge's construction.<ref name = "Fint3"/>

The T. B. White and Sons iron bridge construction company was established in 1868 by Timothy B. White, who had been working as a carpenter and contractor in New Brighton since the 1840s.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Jordan1">{{Harvnb|Jordan|1914|p=532.}}</ref> White had also operated manufacturing facilities for iron cars and woolen mill machinery until 1859, when he concentrated solely on bridge construction.<ref name = "Jordan1"/> White's bridge company operated from a factory on the [[Beaver River (Pennsylvania)|Beaver River]] in New Brighton, Pennsylvania until it was destroyed by fire in 1878, after which, the company relocated across the river to [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]] and restructured as the Penn Bridge Company.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Jordan1"/> The company produced a range of structural and architectural components, in addition to iron truss bridges, and continued to expand into the 20th century when it employed over 500 workers by 1908.<ref name = "Fint5"/> Penn Bridge Company fended off purchase by the [[American Bridge Company]] and continued to operate independently, unlike similar small bridge companies founded in the 19th century.<ref name = "Fint5"/> The company was most prolific of its kind in the [[Pittsburgh]] region, and was responsible for the construction of bridges throughout the United States.<ref name = "Fint5"/>

The ''South Branch Intelligencer'' published periodic updates on the progress of the South Branch Bridge's construction by T. B.

Because Whipple truss bridges were easily disassembled and re-erected, the remaining western span of the Whipple truss over the South Branch was dismantled in 1937 and relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to convey Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs.<ref name = "Fint5"/><ref name = "Knoblock2"/><ref name = "WVSRC2">{{Harvnb|West Virginia State Road Commission|1938|p=}}</ref>

According to Branson Himelwright, a Capon Springs resident who had been a construction worker involved in the re-erection of the Whipple truss span at Capon Lake, the only two ways to cross the Cacapon River to reach Capon Springs were to either cross a swinging footbridge or a ford.<ref name = "McKeown1">{{Harvnb|McKeown|1991|p=}}</ref><ref name = "Fint6">{{Harvnb|Fint|2011|p=8 of the PDF file.}}</ref> During the bridge's construction, a new pier and abutments were constructed to carry the Whipple truss span and a connected [[Truss bridge#Pratt truss|Pratt truss]] which had been salvaged from an unknown bridge.<ref name = "Fint1"/><ref name = "Fint6"/> Himelwright and Jacob "Moss" Rudolph, who had also participated in the bridge's construction, stated in interviews that both the site excavation and concrete work for the pier and abutments were completed by hand.<ref name = "McKeown1"/><ref name = "Fint6"/><ref name = "WVDOH5">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Division of Highways District 5|1991|p=}}</ref>
