'''Edward William "Eddie" Shore''' ([[November 25]], [[1902]] &ndash; [[March 16]], [[1985]]) was a [[Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] player in the [[National Hockey League]].

Born in [[Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan]], Shore played with the [[Regina Capitals]] of the [[Western Canada Hockey League]] in 1924-25. His team finished last in the league and folded at the end of the season. Shore moved to the league champion [[Edmonton Eskimos (hockey)|Edmonton Eskimos]] in 1925-26, where he converted from [[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]] to [[defense (sport)|defense]].

When the WCHL folded in 1926, Shore was sold to the [[Boston Bruins]] of the NHL. As a rookie, he scored 12 [[Goal (ice hockey)|goals]] and 6 [[Assist (ice hockey)|assists]] for a total of 18 points. This was during an era when defensemen scored few goals. Shore helped the Bruins win their first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1929.

Named to the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star]] team for eight of the team's first nine years, Shore was the only NHL defenseman to win the [[Hart Trophy]] as the league's most valuable player four times. A bruiser known for [[Violence in ice hockey|NHL violence]], Shore set an NHL record for 165 [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]] minutes in his second season. He frequently ran over players and skated in a trademark crouch so that it was hard for rivals to knock him down.

In the 1925-26 season, [[Billy Coutu]] and [[Sprague Cleghorn]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] were traded to the Boston Bruins. During their first practice with the Bruins, Shore strutted back and forth in front of Coutu and Cleghorn. Coutu body-slammed Shore, headbutting his skull and severing an ear. Shore visited several doctors who wanted to [[Amputation|amputate]] the ear, but found one who sewed it back on. After refusing [[Anesthesia|anaesthetic]], Shore used a mirror to watch the doctor sew the ear on. Shore claimed Coutu used his hockey stick to cut off the ear, and Coutu was fined $50. Shore later recanted and Coutu's money was refunded. Coutu said he always gave Shore a "limp hand" after that. Coutu was expelled from the NHL a year later for attacking a referee. On [[January 24]] [[1933]], during a game against Montreal, Shore accidentally punched NHL referee-in-chief [[Cooper Smeaton]] during a fight with [[Sylvio Mantha]] and was fined $100.

In Boston on [[December 12]] [[1933]], Shore ended the career of [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] star [[Ace Bailey]] when he charged Bailey from behind. Bailey was knocked unconscious and was in convulsions. In retaliation, Leafs tough-guy [[Red Horner]] punched Shore, whose head hit the ice as he fell from the blow. Shore was knocked out and required seven stitches but wasn't injured. Shore apologized to Bailey after the game. Bailey was hospitalized in critical condition with a fractured skull. He was operated on for more than four hours and there were fears he could die. Shore and Bailey shook hands at centre ice before a benefit game in Bailey's honor on [[February 14]] [[1934]].

Shore and the Bruins won their second Stanley Cup in 1939. Shore retired and bought the [[Springfield Indians]] of the [[American Hockey League]], where he was player-owner in 1939-40. He was persuaded to rejoin the Bruins and played four games for the team before being traded to the [[New York Americans]] on [[January 25]] [[1940]]. He stayed with the Americans through their elimination from the playoffs, and was simultaneously playing with the Indians in their playoff games.

He played two more seasons in Springfield and retired as a player. The Indians halted operations during [[World War II]], and Shore coached the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] of the AHL to the [[Calder Cup]] championship in 1943 and 1944. After the war, the Indians resumed play in the 1946-47 season. As an owner, Shore could be cantankerous and was often accused of treating players with little respect. During the 1966-67 season, the entire Indians team refused to play after Shore suspended without pay three players, including future NHL all-star [[Bill White (hockey)|Bill White]], for what he said was "indifferent play." When the team asked for an explanation, Shore suspended the two players who spoke for the team, one of whom was [[Brian Kilrea]]. [[Alan Eagleson]] was brought in to negotiate with Shore on the players' behalf. The battle escalated for months, ending with Shore giving up day-to-day operations of the club. Shore continued to be owner until he sold the team in 1976. 

On [[February 28]] [[1985]], Shore checked into a Springfield hospital. His condition gradually deteriorated, and he died on [[March 16]], [[1985]] at age 82.

Shore was elected to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1947. The Boston Bruins retired his number ''2''. The [[Eddie Shore Plaque]] is given annually to the AHL's best defenceman. Shore was also mentioned in the movie ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]''. In 1998, he was ranked number 10 on ''[[The Hockey News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, making him the highest-ranked pre-[[World War II]] player.
