'''Dick Wallen''' (born c. 1936) is a former [[American football]] player who was a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at the [[End (American football)|end]] position in 1957 while playing for [[UCLA]].  He was awarded the 1957 [[W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy]] as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast.  He was inducted into the [[UCLA Bruins#UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame|UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1996.

==Early years==
A native of [[Alhambra, California]], Wallen won 11 letters at [[Alhambra High School]], including letters in football, tennis, track and basketball.<ref name=Model>{{cite news|author=Al Wolf|title=Model Collegian: Wallen Tops on Campus as Well as on Gridiron|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-10-15}}</ref>  He was also voted the prep Player of the Year in the Pacific League.<ref name=Model/>  Wallen enrolled at UCLA in 1955.  He was converted by UCLA coach [[Red Sanders]] from a [[wingback]] to an end.  Wallen was a three-year starter at the end position for UCLA in 1956, 1957, and 1958.  As a sophomore, he caught 23 passes for 308 yards and two touchdowns.

==Consensus All-American in 1957==
Wallen's greatest success as a football player came in his junior year in 1957.  That year, Wallen caught 20 passes for 303 yards.<ref name=Grid/>  He was also a star on defense, intercepting four passes and recovering six opposition fumbles.<ref name=Grid/>  Wallen led the UCLA team in minutes played, playing 399 minutes out of a possible 600.<ref name=Grid>{{cite news|author=Al Wolf|title=Grid Coaches Honor Wallen|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-11-29}}</ref>  UCLA coach Sanders praised Wallen's skills:<blockquote>"'Wallen's got the best hands I ever saw in college ball,' says Sanders, 'and that includes fellows like [[Don Hutson]] when he was at Alabama.  He's a natural born receiver; you don't learn those finger-tip haul downs Dick makes.  His hand aren't big either.  But he just has an instinct for catching a football, plus intelligence, quick judgment and perfect balance.  It's a joy to coach a kid like that because he's eager to learn and never makes the same mistake twice."<ref name=Model/></blockquote>
Opposing coaches also praised Wallen. Stanford's Coach Joe Ruetz said, "Dick Wallen is as fine a receiver as I've ever seen."<ref name=Giant>{{cite news|author=Dick Hyland|title=Wallen Proves Giant on Defense, Too|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1947-10-13}}</ref>  After an October 1957 game against Washington, ''Los Angeles Times'' sports writer Dick Hyland called Wallen a "Giant on Defense," writing as follows:<blockquote>"Wallen was much more than a pass receiver.  True, he again jumped in the air and duplicated his Illinois game stunt of making an unbelievable one-handed catch of a ball thrown over his head.  ... His big contributions, however, were on defense.  Twice, acting with the quickness of a cat, the 175-pound Bruin junior backed away while rushing Washington Quarterback Al Ferguson and intercepted the latter's short lob passes aimed to go well over Wallen's head."<ref name=Giant/></blockquote>
For his performance in 1957, Wallen received numerous awards, including first-team All-American designations from the [[Associated Press]], [[American Football Coaches Association]], [[Football Writers Association of America]], Newspaper Editors Association, and Walter Camp Football Foundation.  He was the only junior selected to the 1957 AP All-America Team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wallen Lone Junior on AP All-America|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-12-05}}</ref>  He also received the American Legion Trophy as UCLA's most valuable player,<ref>{{cite news|title=Eight Bruins Get Awards at Grid Banquet|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-12-13}}</ref> and the [[W.J.

==1958 season==
As a senior in 1958, Wallen's eligibility was limited to five games under [[Pacific Coast Conference]] rules.  He had one of his finest games in an October 1958 loss to [[Florida Gators football|Florida]].  Wallen caught two touchdown passes (UCLA's only touchdowns) in his final home game, prompting Mal Florence to write the following:<blockquote>"Florida won the ball game, but Bruin end Dick Wallen won the acclaim of everyone in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]] who witnessed his spectacular pass-catching exhibition last night.  Wallen, a five-game senior playing his final local game, was the talk of both dressing rooms.  [[Bob Woodruff (American football)|Bob Woodruff]], whose Gators triumphed 21-14, said following the game, 'There's no pass defense against a great receiver like Wallen.'"<ref>{{cite news|author=Mal Florence|title=Great Receiver: Gator Coach Hails Wallen After Game|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1958-10-11}}</ref></blockquote>  The restriction on Wallen's playing time as a senior caused him to fall short of breaking UCLA's all-time pass receiving records.  In October 1958, the ''Los Angeles Times'' noted: "Had the Pacific Coast Conference not limited him to five games this season though, Wallen perhaps would have swept the slate clean."<ref>{{cite news|author=Al Wolf|title=Wallen's Chances for Record Slim: Five-Game Penalty Wrecks Bruin Star's Hopes of Setting 3-Year Receiving Marks|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1958-10-15}}</ref>

Wallen finished his collegiate career at UCLA with 62 receptions for 822 yards, nine touchdowns and an average of 13.3 yards per reception.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football Kickoff '86|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1986-09-17}}</ref>

==Wallen the "Model Collegian"==
Wallen excelled in the classroom as well as the football field.  A 1957 profile of Wallen in the ''Los Angeles Times'' bore the headline: "MODEL COLLEGIAN: Wallen Tops on Campus as Well as Gridiron."<ref name=Model/>  Wallen was a physics major who expressed no interest in playing professional football, stating his intent instead to attend law school and become a patent attorney.<ref name=Model/>  He spent his summers working in a patent law office, and the author of the ''Times'' profile opined that "if they were picking an All-America of model college students, this 21-year-old junior from Alhambra might be named captain of the first team."<ref name=Model/>

Wallen was inducted into the [[UCLA Bruins#UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame|UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame|publisher=UCLA Bruins|url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/ot/hof-inductees.html}}</ref>
