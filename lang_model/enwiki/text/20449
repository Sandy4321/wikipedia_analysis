'''Anonymous''' (used as a [[mass noun]]) is a loosely associated network of [[hacktivism|hacktivist]]s. A website associated with the group describes it as "an internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives".{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1678}} The group became known for a series of well-publicized hacks and [[DDoS attack|distributed denial-of-service]] (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites.

Anonymous originated in 2003 on the [[imageboard]] [[4chan]], representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an [[anarchy|anarchic]], digitized [[global brain]].<ref name="citypaper">{{cite web |url= http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 |publisher=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |title=Serious Business: Anonymous Takes On Scientology (and Doesn't Afraid of Anything) |last=Landers |first=Chris| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543| archivedate= June 8, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The group is also associated with the satirical open [[wiki]] [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Anonymous members (known as "Anons") can be distinguished in public by the wearing of stylised [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s.<ref>{{cite news | first = Rosie | last = Waites | title = V for Vendetta masks: Who | date = October 20, 2011 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate = October 20, 2011}}</ref> 

In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or "[[lulz]]". Beginning with 2008's [[Project Chanology]]&mdash;a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the [[Church of Scientology]]&mdash;the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative, international hacktivism. Anons undertook protests and other actions in retaliation against anti-[[Copyright infringement|digital piracy]] campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]; and corporations such as [[PayPal]], [[MasterCard]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], and [[Sony]]. Anons have publicly supported [[WikiLeaks]] and the [[Occupy movement]]. Related groups [[LulzSec]] and [[Operation AntiSec]] carried out cyberattacks on US government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers.

Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the US, UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey. Evaluations of the group's actions and effectiveness vary widely.

== Philosophy ==
Anonymous has no strictly defined philosophy, and internal dissent is a regular feature of the group.{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1678}} A website associated with the group describes it as "an internet gathering" with "a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives".{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1678}} [[Gabriella Coleman]] writes of the group, "In some ways, it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants, many of who don't even bother to leave a trace of their thoughts, motivations, and reactions. Among those that do, opinions vary considerably."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/what-its-like-to-participate-in-anonymous-actions/67860/ |title=What It's Like to Participate in Anonymous' Actions |author=Coleman, Gabriella |date=December 10, 2010 |work=The Atlantic |publisher= |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GJw0WdUd |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Broadly speaking, Anons oppose internet censorship and control, and the majority of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global [[Occupy movement]] and the [[Arab Spring]].{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1682}} Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious activism.{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1679}}{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=92}}

Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. [[Parmy Olson]] and others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; Olson writes, "There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt."{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=58&ndash;59}} Some members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=x}} Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective;{{sfn|Kelly|2012|p=1679}} 
[[Carole Cadwalladr]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' compared the group's decentralized structure to that of [[al-Qaeda]], writing, "If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/08/anonymous-behind-masks-cyber-insurgents |title=Anonymous: behind the masks of the cyber insurgents |author=Cadwalladr, Carole |date=September 8, 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GJhbVQFz |deadurl=no}}</ref> Olson, who formerly described Anonymous as a "brand", stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a "movement" rather than a group: "anyone can be part of it.

The group's few rules include not disclosing one's identity, not discussing the group, and not attacking media.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=7}} Members commonly use the tagline "We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.

Journalists have commented that Anonymous' secrecy, fabrications, and media awareness pose an unusual challenge for reporting on the group's actions and motivations.<ref name=Norton />{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=122&ndash;23}} [[Quinn Norton]] of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' writes that "Anons lie when they have no reason to lie.

=== 4chan raids (2004&ndash;2007) ===
{{main|4chan}}

[[Image:Anonymous Fox 11.jpg|thumb|[[KTTV]] Fox 11 investigative report on Anonymous. The report focused on what were then contemporary instances of internet bullying by Anonymous.<ref name="foxnewsanonreport"/>]]
The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on [[imageboard]]s, particularly the /b/ board of [[4chan]], dedicated to random content. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a "Forced_Anon" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=28}} As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an [[Internet meme]].<ref name="whipple">{{cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |title= Scientology: the Anonymous protesters. |work=The Times |location=UK |date=June 20, 2008 |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece }}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>

Users of 4chan's /b/ board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids. In a raid on July 12, 2006, for example, large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site [[Habbo Hotel]] with identical avatars; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the hotel's pool, stating it was "closed due to fail and AIDS".{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=49}} Future LulzSec member [[Topiary (hacktivist)|Topiary]] became involved with the site at this time, inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via [[Skype]].{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=48}} Due to the growing traffic on 4chan's boards, users soon began to plot pranks offline using [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC).{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=50&ndash;52}} These raids resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous, a report by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, California in the U.S. The report called the group "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", and an "Internet hate machine".<ref name="foxnewsanonreport">{{cite news |author=Shuman, Phil |title=FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous{{'-}} |url=http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=3894628&version=7&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=VSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |publisher=[[KTTV]] ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) |work=MyFOX Los Angeles |date=July 26, 2007 |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080522123812/http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=3894628&version=7&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=VSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1|archivedate=May 22, 2008}}</ref>{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=57&ndash;58}}

{{main|Encyclopedia Dramatica}}
Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DiGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to [[livejournal]], but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for satirical and other purposes. The [[not safe for work]] site celebrates a [[Counterculture|subversive]] "[[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] culture", and documents [[Internet memes]], [[cyberculture|culture]], and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, "raids", large scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of [[Internet communities]] that are accused of [[self-censorship]] in order to garner prestige or positive coverage from traditional and [[Old media|established media outlets]]. Journalist [[Julian Dibbell]] described Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Dramatica as the site "where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend."<ref name="assclown">

{{main|Project Chanology}}
[[File:Message to Scientology.ogv|thumb|300px|"[[Message to Scientology]]", January 21, 2008]]
Anonymous first became associated with [[hacktivism]]{{efn|A portmanteau of "hacking" and "activism"}} in 2008 following a series of actions against the [[Church of Scientology]] known as Project Chanology. On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog [[Gawker]] posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] praised the religion;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D8U6KGQG0.html |title=Cruise bio hits stores as video clip of actor praising Scientology makes it way to Internet |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> the Church responded with a [[cease-and-desist letter]] for violation of copyright.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15129123.html |title=Tom Cruise's Scary Movie; In Church Promo, the Scientologist Is Hard to Suppress |author=Tucker, Neely |date=January 18, 2008 |work=Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending [[black fax]]es designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching [[DDoS]] attacks against its websites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=63&ndash;65}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-174076065.html |title=Fair game; Scientology |date=February 2, 2008 |work=The Economist |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> 

The DDoS attacks were at first carried out with the applications [[Gigaloader]] and [[JMeter]]. Within a few days, these were supplanted by the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] (LOIC), a network stress testing application allowing users to flood a server with [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead to a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their [[IP address]]es.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=71&ndash;72, 122, 124, 126&ndash;29}} Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=206}}<ref name=Anon1012>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/anonymous-101-part-deux/all/ |title=Anonymous 101 Part Deux: Morals Triumph Over Lulz |author=Norton, Quinn |date=December 30, 2011 |work=Wired |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNd5B6lC |deadurl=no}}</ref>

=== Operation: Payback is a Bitch (2010) ===
By the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased. A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called "moralfags" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls).{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=93&ndash;94}} By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=102}}

In September 2010, however, Anons became aware of [[Aiplex Software]], an Indian software company that contracted with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites providing pirated content, such as [[The Pirate Bay]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11371315 |title=Activists target recording industry websites |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 27, 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=102}} Coordinating through IRC, Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex's website for a day. Primarily using LOIC, the group then targeted the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), successfully bringing down both sites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=103}} On September 19, future LulzSec member Mustafa Al-Bassam (known as "Tflow") and other Anons hacked the website of copyright alliance<!-- This website does not appear to capitalize its name -->, an anti-piracy group, and posted the name of the operation: "Payback Is A Bitch".{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=104}} Anons also issued a press release, stating:

<blockquote>Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people<U+2019>s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another.

In the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify. Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as [[Operation Tunisia]] in support of [[Arab Spring]] movements. Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers from government surveillance, while fellow future LulzSec member [[Hector Xavier Monsegur]] (alias "Sabu") and others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web-hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian government websites, taking them offline. Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer's computer to hack the website of Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]], replacing it with a message from Anonymous.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=141&ndash;45}} Anons also helped Tunisian dissidents share videos online about the uprising.<ref name=AJ19511>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/05/201151917634659824.html |title=Anonymous and the Arab uprisings |author=Ryan, Yasmine |date=May 19, 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNSzc9Ez |deadurl=no}}</ref> In Operation Egypt, Anons collaborated with the activist group [[Telecomix]] to help dissidents access government-censored websites.<ref name=AJ19511 /> Sabu and Topiary went on to participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, and Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=148}}

Tflow, Sabu, Topiary, and Ryan Ackroyd (known as "Kayla") collaborated in February 2011 on a cyber-attack against [[Aaron Barr]], CEO of the computer security firm [[HBGary Federal]], in retaliation for his research on Anonymous and his threat to expose members of the group. Using a [[SQL injection]] weakness, the four hacked the HBGary site, used Barr's captured password to vandalize his Twitter feed with racist messages, and released an enormous cache of HBGary's e-mails in a [[torrent file]] on Pirate Bay.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=10&ndash;24}} The e-mails stated that Barr and HBGary had proposed to [[Bank of America]] a plan to discredit WikiLeaks in retaliation for a planned leak of Bank of America documents,{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=200}} and the leak caused substantial public relations harm to the firm as well as leading one US congressman to call for a congressional investigation.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=161, 164}} Barr resigned as CEO before the end of the month.{{sfn|Olson|2012|p=164}}

Several attacks by Anons have targeted organizations accused of homophobia. In February 2011, an open letter was published on AnonNews.org threatening the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], an organization based in [[Kansas]] in the US known for picketing funerals with signs reading "God Hates Fags".{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=176&ndash;77}} During a live radio current affairs program in which Topiary debated church member [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]], Anons hacked one of the organization's websites.{{sfn|Olson|2012|pp=178&ndash;88}} After the church announced its intentions in December 2012 to picket the funerals of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] victims, Anons published the names, phone numbers, and e-mail and home addresses of church members and brought down GodHatesFags.com with a DDoS attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/anonymous-vows-to-destroy-westboro-baptist-church-over-sandy-hook-picket-plans/ |title=Anonymous vows to <U+2018>destroy<U+2019> Westboro Baptist Church over Sandy Hook picket plans |date=December 17, 2012 |work= |publisher=The Raw Story |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNRaFNcS |deadurl=no}}</ref> Hacktivists also circulated petitions to have the church's tax-exempt status investigated.<ref name=RT121712>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/usa/westboro-church-anonymous-group-233/ |title=Hacktivists strike Westboro Baptist Church over Newtown tragedy |date=December 17, 2012 |publisher=RT |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNRgykuW |deadurl=no}}</ref> In August 2012, Anons hacked the site of Ugandan Prime Minister [[Amama Mbabazi]] in retaliation for the [[Parliament of Uganda]]'s consideration of [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|an anti-homosexuality law]] permitting capital punishment.<ref name=BBC81612>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19281664 |title=Uganda prime minister hacked 'over gay rights' |date=August 16, 2012  |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNS8YurR |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In April 2011, Anons launched a series of attacks against [[Sony]] in retaliation for trying to stop hacks of the [[PlayStation 3]] game console. More than 100 million Sony accounts were compromised, and the Sony services [[Qriocity]] and [[PlayStation Network]] were taken down for a month apiece by cyberattacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-28794321.html |title=Sony caught up in cyber war with indignant hackers: ; Company with security once considered 'robust' now dealing with constant breaches |agency=Associated Press |date=May 30, 2011 |work=Charleston Daily Mail |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2011, the small group of Anons behind the HBGary Federal hack&mdash;including Tflow, Topiary, Sabu, and Kayla&mdash;formed the hacker group "Lulz Security", commonly abbreviated "LulzSec". The group's first attack was against [[Fox.com]], leaking several passwords, LinkedIn profiles, and the names of 73,000 X Factor contestants. In May 2011, members of Lulz Security gained international attention for hacking into the American [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) website.

Evaluations of Anonymous' actions and effectiveness vary widely.

In 2012, [[Public Radio International]] reported that the US [[National Security Agency]] considered Anonymous a potential national security threat and had warned the president that it could develop the capability to disable parts of the US power grid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/government/nsa-declares-anonymous-a-threat-to-national-security-8559.html |title=National Security Agency calls hacktivist group 'Anonymous' a threat to national security |date=February 27, 2012 |publisher=Public Radio International |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNedLTUQ |deadurl=no}}</ref> In contrast, CNN reported in the same year that "security industry experts generally don't consider Anonymous a major player in the world of cybercrime" due the group's reliance on DDoS attacks that briefly disabled websites rather than the more serious damage possible through hacking. One security consultant compared the group to "a jewelry thief that drives through a window, steal jewels, and rather than keep them, waves them around and tosses them out to a crowd ... They're very noisy, low-grade crimes."<ref name=Goldman/> In its ''2013 Threats Predictions'' report, [[McAfee]] wrote that the technical sophistication of Anonymous was in decline and that it was losing supporters due to "too many uncoordinated and unclear operations".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-threat-predictions-2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=2013 Threats Predictions |publisher=McAfee |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |archivedate=May 5, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GNeGDEao |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Graham Cluley, a security expert for [[Sophos]], argued that Anonymous' actions against child porn websites hosted on a [[Darknet (file sharing)|darknet]] could be counterproductive, commenting that while their intentions appear beneficial, the removal of illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/24/anonymous_fight_child_abuse_network/|title=Anonymous shuts down hidden child abuse hub|last=Leyden|first=John |date=October 24, 2011|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref> 
Some commentators also argued that the DDoS attacks by Anonymous following the January 2012 [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] protests had proved counterproductive. Molly Wood of [[CNET]] wrote that "[i]f the SOPA/PIPA protests were the Web's moment of inspiring, non-violent, hand-holding civil disobedience, #OpMegaUpload feels like the unsettling wave of car-burning hooligans that sweep in and incite the riot portion of the play."<ref name=CNET12>{{cite news | last = Wood | first = Molly | authorlink = Molly Wood | date = January 19, 2012 | title = Anonymous goes nuclear; everybody loses? | publisher = CNET | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/ | accessdate =January 21, 2012 }}</ref> Dwight Silverman of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' concurred, stating that "Anonymous' actions hurt the movement to kill SOPA/PIPA by highlighting online lawlessness."<ref>{{cite news | last = Jonsson | first = Patrik | date = January 21, 2012 | title = SOPA: Feds go after Megaupload as Congress reviews anti-piracy bills | work = The Christian Science Monitor | url = http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/sopa-feds-go-after-megaupload-congress-reviews-anti-piracy-bills | accessdate =January 22, 2012 }}</ref> The [[Oxford Internet Institute]]'s Joss Wright wrote that "In one sense the actions of Anonymous are themselves, anonymously and unaccountably, censoring websites in response to positions with which they disagree."<ref name=BBC120>{{cite news | last = Kelion | first = Leo | date = January 20, 2012 | title = Hackers retaliate over Megaupload website shutdown |publisher=BBC News | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16646023 | accessdate =January 21, 2012 }}</ref>

<blockquote>In some cases, yes, I think it has in terms of some of the stuff they did in the Middle East supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people -- I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.<ref name=Olson/></blockquote>

Quinn Norton of ''Wired'' wrote of the group in 2011:
<blockquote>I will confess up front that I love Anonymous, but not because I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's character V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change and the need for change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army <U+2013> that's Rule 44 <U+2013> yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.<ref name=Anon101/></blockquote>
