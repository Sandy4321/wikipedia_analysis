==Background==
After the end of her "[[Carnival Ride Tour]]", in February 2009, Underwood began writing songs for her new album ''Play On''. She collaborated with a number of producers which included [[Brett James]], one of the three co-writers of her hit single "[[Jesus, Take the Wheel]]",<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Marianne|date=2009-12-21|title=Sassy Groove = Smokin' Hit|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=45|pages=22|issn=1074-3235|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref> and [[Mike Elizondo]], who had collaborated with [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]].  Elizondo came up with the main melody of the song, to which James and Underwood set the lyrics.<ref name="weekly"/> James then suggested the title "Cowboy Casanova" off a list of potential titles that he had, and the  lyrics talk about a male character who is a "devil in disguise." In an interview with [[Country Music Television|CMT]] Underwood said,
{{Quote|"I think to every woman, this song would be telling a story about someone they know or met or has tried to pick them up in a bar".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625358/20091102/story.jhtml|title=Carrie Underwood Says 'Every Woman' Has Met A Cowboy Casanova|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=2009-11-03|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>  "We're not trashing this guy, we're just warning these other girls about him."<ref name="weekly"/>|}}

An unfinished version of the song leaked online on September 2, 2009 after receiving airplay from [[KMPS-FM]] in [[Seattle]]. The label then rush-released the official version to Underwood's [[YouTube]] channel on September 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267503/carrie-underwood-rushes-new-single-cowboy-casanova-after-unauthorized-leak|title= Carrie Underwood Rushes New Single 'Cowboy Casanova' After Unauthorized Leak|last=Herrera|first=Monica|date=2009-09-03|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref> It was officially made available for download on September 14, 2009.

==Critical reception==
The song has been met with generally favorable reviews. ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' reviewed the song favorably, stating that it "gives [Underwood] the chance to display the sassy side of her musical persona, which made previous hit "[[Before He Cheats]]" such an impact record. Blessed with a versatile set of pipes that make the best of any tune, Underwood shines on this steamy upbeat number".<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1070876/carrie-underwood-cowboy-casanova|title =Carrie Underwood, "Cowboy Casanova" Billboard.com|publisher =Billboard.com|accessdate =2010-10-14}}</ref> Matt Bjorke of ''Roughstock'' also gave a favorable review, saying, "Although the song borrows familiar melodic themes, the production is sparkling; Carrie sings the verses with rapid-fire precision and the hook is just infectious.

The video was directed by Theresa Wingert and it features Underwood and an entourage of attractive female dancers all wearing [[flapper]] party gowns.  She warns the video's audience, as well as her entourage, about smooth-talking attractive men and their true intentions.  An attractive man sporting a fancy outfit that consists of an [[overcoat]] and a [[fedora]] gazes at the scene with interest. The man, a well representation of the song's topic, seemingly has designs on Underwood and as the video progresses the dancers become dressed in revealing clothing, consisting of [[garter (stockings)|garters]] and [[corsets]]. Eventually Underwood, along with her empowered entourage, have a showdown with the man in a back-alley and defiantly spurn his advances, leading him to give up and walk away. The video also became Underwood's first [[choreography|choreographed]] video.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.nashvillegab.com/2009/09/carrie-and-her-choreographer-give-us-a-video-for-cowboy-casanova.html|title =NashvilleGab - Nashville news and country music gossip: Carrie and her choreographer give us a video for Cowboy Casanova|publisher =Nashvillegab.com|accessdate =2010-10-14}}</ref>
