The '''murder of Danielle Jones''' was an [[English people|English]] murder case [[Murder conviction without a body|where no body was found]] and the conviction relied upon [[forensic linguistics|forensic authorship analysis]] of [[text messaging|text message]]s sent on the victim's [[mobile phone]]. Danielle Sarah Jones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_7512.htm|title=High Court setting of minimum terms for mandatory life sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003|publisher=Her Majesty's Courts Service|date=December 9, 2005 |accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref> (16 October 1985 - [[Circa|c.]]&nbsp;18 June 2001), was last seen alive on 18 June 2001; her body has never been found.

Jones' uncle Stuart Campbell, a [[builder]], was [[Conviction|convicted]] of abduction and murder on 19 December 2002. Campbell was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for murder as well as 10 years for abduction.

After the trial, controversy arose when it was revealed Campbell had prior convictions for indecent assault on other girls of similar ages.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2590861.stm|title='Give us Danielle's body' say parents|publisher=BBC news|date=December 19, 2002 |accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref> The use of forensic authorship analysis of text messages in the case provoked research into its use in other cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3303637.stm|title=Mobile phones&nbsp;<U+2013> the new fingerprints|publisher=BBC news|date=December 18, 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-02 | first=Chris | last=Summers}}</ref>

==Disappearance and investigation==
Jones was last seen near her home in [[East Tilbury]], [[Essex]], on the morning of 18 June 2001, while walking to a bus stop.

Suspicion fell on Campbell almost immediately and he was first arrested on 23 June 2001, five days after Jones went missing.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1495815.stm Danielle police question uncle] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref> Detectives had delayed his arrest while weighing the possibility of endangering Jones's life, on the presumption she was still alive and being held against her will, against the possibility of Campbell leading the police to her.<ref name="BBC1">{{cite news|title=Uncle with a secret obsession|date=2002-12-19 |work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2562935.stm|author=Peter Gould}}</ref> During police interviews Campbell was described as "unco-operative". In one 20-minute interview with the police, Campbell refused to comment on 50 questions.<ref>{{cite news|date=2001-08-18 |title=Police arrest Danielle's uncle and hold him for questioning |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |author=Jason Bennetto|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-arrest-danielles-uncle-and-hold-him-for-questioning-662949.html | location=London}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2011}}

The investigation included several appeals to the public for information, including a reconstruction on the BBC television programme ''[[Crimewatch]]''.  During the investigation, over 900 police officers and support staff searched over 1500 locations for Jones' body.<ref>{{cite news |date=2001-07-11|title=Crimewatch appeal for Danielle|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1434531.stm}}</ref><ref name="withoutabody" />

==Murder trial==
The police who investigated Jones's disappearance were convinced within two months of her disappearance that she had been murdered, as on 17 August 2001 they had re-arrested Campbell on suspicion of murder, after finding "significant evidence" - an unusual step to take in the case of someone whose body has not been found.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1495815.stm | work=BBC News | title=Danielle police question uncle | date=2001-08-17}}</ref>

A police [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] said to the [[BBC]] that Campbell "developed a relationship with Danielle that was certainly inappropriate and probably unlawful." Jones apparently tried to disengage, but Campbell  resisted.  By 14 November 2001, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided that the police had enough evidence to [[prosecution|prosecute]] Campbell for murder even though it would be harder to secure a conviction without a body.<ref name="BBC1"/><ref name="withoutabody">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2562195.stm|title=Proving murder without a body|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2002-12-19|accessdate=2006-09-28 | first=Peter | last=Gould}}</ref>

On 14 October 2002, Campbell went on trial for abduction and murder, having spent 11 months on remand. The trial was unusual in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as prosecutions for murder without a body are rare{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. The Crown's case rested upon several pieces of evidence. Jones had disappeared without contacting her parents and had been seen talking to a man in a blue [[Ford Transit]] van resembling Campbell's on the morning of her disappearance. The testing of blood-stained stockings discovered in the loft of Campbell's house found DNA matching both himself and his niece; lip gloss used by Jones was also found in Campbell's home. A diary kept by Campbell revealed an obsession with teenage girls, with testimonies that Campbell had manipulated young girls into posing for topless photographs.

</div>
[[Mobile Switching Center]] records demonstrated that Campbell's [[Wiktionary:Alibi|alibi]] of being at a [[Do it yourself|D-I-Y]] store half an hour away in [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]] was false, and that Campbell's and Jones's mobile phones had been within the range of a single [[mobile phone mast]] at the time that a text message had allegedly been sent by Jones to Campbell. This along with forensic authorship analysis indicated that Campbell had written the message, not Jones, implying that Campbell had sent the message to himself using Jones's phone to make it appear that she was still alive.<ref name="BBC1"/><ref name="withoutabody"/>

Campbell was found guilty of both charges on 19 December 2002, and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder to run concurrently with a 10-year sentence for abduction. The [[High Court]] later ruled that Campbell should serve a minimum of 20 years before being considered for parole, meaning that he is set to remain imprisoned until at least November 2021 and the age of 63.<ref name="uncleconvicted">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2581739.stm|title=Danielle's uncle jailed for murder|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2002-12-19 |accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref>

==Aftermath of the trial==
After his trial, it was revealed that in 1989, Campbell received a 12-month [[suspended sentence]] for forcibly detaining a 14-year-old girl in his house and taking indecent photographs of her.<ref name="uncleconvicted"/>

The use of text messaging evidence in the trial inspired a group of researchers at the [[University of Leicester]] to begin studying text messaging styles, in the belief research into the forensic authorship analysis of such things would help with further criminal cases.<ref>{{cite news|date=2006-08-10|title=Text messages could solve crimes|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4779981.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=We will cu in court|work=Leicester Mercury|pages=21|date=2006-08-11|author=Ian Wishart}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2006-08-11|title=Texting study to catch criminals|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4780713.stm}}</ref>

In 2004, Campbell was granted leave to appeal his conviction on the grounds that evidence of his obsession with Jones, and of his interest in schoolgirls, should have been excluded at his trial, and on the further grounds that one of the jurors should have been discharged because they were the next door neighbour of a police officer involved in the case. The appeal was dismissed in 2005 by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].<ref>{{cite news|date=2004-04-23 |title=Danielle murder leave to appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3653405.stm |work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=2005-01-21|title=Danielle killer loses appeal bid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/4191321.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

On 28 July 2005, an [[inquest]] by the [[coroner]] was held into Jones' disappearance, returning a verdict of [[unlawful killing]]. Police interviews with Campbell in prison reported that Campbell had not had anything to say regarding the location of Jones's body.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police 'won't give up' search for body.|work=Western Mail|date=2005-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Danielle inquest to be held four years after murder|date=2005-07-14 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/13/udanielle.xml&sSheet=/portal/2005/07/13/ixportaltop.html | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Uncle refuses to reveal where Danielle's body can be found|author=David Sapsted|date=2005-07-29|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/07/29/ndani29.xml&sSheet=/news/2005/07/29/ixhome.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited | location=London}}</ref>

==Other cases==
Contrasts between this case and the [[murder of Hannah Williams]] have been drawn, citing the disparity in news media coverage of the two as an example of [[missing white woman syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding Homicide|author=Fiona Brookman|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-4755-8|page=257}}</ref> Jewkes cites the media coverage of the Jones case as an example of the news media's eroticization of the victim in such cases, pointing to the news media's reports of the "inappropriate" (i.e. abusive) sexual relationship between victim and murderer, and the news media's publication of photographs of the victim's stockings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Media and Crime|author=Yvonne Jewkes|pages=48<U+2013>49|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-4765-5}}</ref>
