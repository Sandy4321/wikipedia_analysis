'''Struthiosaurinae''' is a [[subfamily]] of [[ankylosauria]]n [[dinosaur]]s from the [[Cretaceous]] of [[Europe]]. It is defined as the most inclusive clade containing ''[[Europelta]]'' but not ''[[Cedarpelta]]'', ''[[Peloroplites]]'', ''[[Sauropelta]]'' or ''[[Edmontonia]]''. It was originally defined by [[Franz Nopcsa]] in 1923 as a subfamily of [[Acanthopholidae]], now a junior synonym of [[Nodosauridae]]. It includes ''[[Anoplosaurus]]'', ''[[Europelta]]'', ''[[Hungarosaurus]]'', and ''[[Struthiosaurus]]''.

==History==
[[Franz Nopcsa]], in 1902, proposed [[Acanthopholidae]], a clade of lightly-built [[thyreophora]]ns. It included ''[[Acanthopholis]]'', ''[[Polacanthus]]'', ''[[Stegopelta]]'', ''[[Stegoceras]]'', and ''[[Struthiosaurus]]''. In 1923 he divided the [[family (biology)|family]] into the two subfamilies [[Acanthopholinae]] and Struthiosaurinae. He then downgraded Acanthopholidae to a subfamily inside [[Nodosauridae]]. That clade included ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' and Acanthopholinae. In Acanthopholinae he placed ''Acanthopholis'', ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', ''[[Rhodanosaurus]]'', ''Struthiosaurus'', and ''[[Troodon]]''. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaurs now considered to be a [[polacanthidae|polacanthid]], a [[pachycephalosaur]] and ''Acanthopholis'', a [[genus]] that is now considered to be a [[nomen dubium]].<ref name="kirklandseuropelta">{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0080405}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Skeletal reconstruction of Europelta.png|thumb|left|Skeletal reconstruction of ''[[Europelta]]'', the most completely known [[ankylosauria]]n from [[Europe]]]] 
Struthiosaurinae has a group of defining characteristics that allow it to be set apart from other clade and exclude certain genera. The characteristics are, they have a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal unfused quadrate oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; mandibular condyles three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near predentary symphysis; a dorsally arched sacrum; an acromion process dorsal to the midpoint of the [[scapula]] to [[coracoid]] suture; a straight [[ischium]] with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and erect pelvic [[osteoderm]]s with flat bases.<ref name="kirklandseuropelta"/>

==Classification==
According to [[James Kirkland]] ''et al.'', Acanthopholinae was not acceptable for the new clade previously unrecognized nodosaurids, and the next published term for the clades name was Struthiosaurinae, so it was decided that it would be the name. To ensure the group was rendered valid, Kirkland ''et al.'' redefined Struthiosaurinae as "The most inclusive clade containing ''[[Europelta]]'' but not ''[[Cedarpelta]]'', ''[[Peloroplites]]'', ''[[Sauropelta]]'', or ''[[Edmontonia]]''". This definition includes the genera ''[[Anoplosaurus]]'', ''Europelta'', ''[[Hungarosaurus]]'' and ''[[Struthiosaurus]]'' in the new clade.<ref name="kirklandseuropelta"/>
