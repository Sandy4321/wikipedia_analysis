'''''The Adventures of Tintin''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Aventures de Tintin'''}}, {{lang-nl|'''De Avonturen van Kuifje'''}}) is a series of [[comic book]]s created by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[Herg<U+00E9>]], the pen name of Georges Remi (1907&ndash;1983). The series first appeared in French in a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me|Le Vingti<U+00E8>me Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} on [[January 10]], [[1929]]. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, ''The Adventures of Tintin'' presents a number of characters in distinctive settings. The series has continued as a favourite of readers and critics alike for over 70 years.

The hero of the series is the [[eponym]]ous character, [[Tintin and Snowy#Tintin|Tintin]], a young Belgian reporter and traveller. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful [[Wire Fox Terrier|fox terrier]] dog [[Tintin_and_Snowy#Snowy (Milou)|Snowy]] (''Milou'' in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy [[Captain Haddock]], the bright but tone deaf [[Professor Calculus]] (''Professeur Tournesol'' in French) and other colourful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] (''Dupond et Dupont'' in French).

The success of the series saw the serialised strips collected into a series of albums (23 in all), spun into a successful [[Tintin (magazine)|magazine]] and adapted for both [[film]] and [[theatre]]. The series is one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|author = Maev Kennedy|title = Museum aims to draw crowds with cartoon boy wonder aged 75|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1088427,00.html|publisher = The Guardian|date = 2003-11-19|accessdate = 2006-09-12}}</ref>

==Overview==

Tintin is a reporter, and [[Herg<U+00E9>]] uses this to present the character in a number of adventures which were contemporaneous to the period in which he was working (most notably, the [[Bolshevik]] uprising in [[Russia]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]]) and sometimes even prescient (the [[moon landing]]s). Herg<U+00E9> also created a world for Tintin which managed to reduce detail to a simplified but recognisable and realistic representation, an effect Herg<U+00E9> was able to achieve with reference to a well-maintained archive of images.<ref name="Farr">{{cite journal | last =Farr | first =Michael | authorlink =Michael Farr | coauthors = | year =2004 | month =March | title =Thundering Typhoons | journal =History Today | volume =54 | issue =3 | pages =62 | id = | url = | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Though Tintin's adventures are formulaic<U+2014>presenting a mystery which is then solved logically<U+2014>Herg<U+00E9> infused the strip with his own sense of humour,<ref name="Farr" /> and created supporting characters who, whilst being predictable, were filled with charm that allowed the reader to engage with them. This formula of comfortable, humorous predictability is similar to the presentation of cast in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' strip or [[The Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Rebecca Bengal| year=2006| title=Phoebe Glockner On Cartooning | format=html | work=Tintin and I | url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/tintinandi/sfartists_gloeckner.html | accessdate = 2006-08-21}}</ref> Herg<U+00E9> also had a great understanding of the mechanics of the comic strip, especially pacing, a skill displayed in ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]'', a work he meant to be packed with tension in which nothing actually happens.<ref name="Mills"/>
	 
Herg<U+00E9> initially improvised the creation of Tintin's adventures, uncertain how Tintin would escape from whatever predicament appeared. Not until after the completion of ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' was Herg<U+00E9> encouraged to research and plan his stories. The impetus came from [[Zhang Chongren]], a Chinese student who, on hearing Herg<U+00E9> was to send Tintin to China in his next adventure, urged him to avoid perpetuating the perceptions Europeans had of China at the time. Herg<U+00E9> and Zhang collaborated on the next serial, ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', which has been cited by critics as Herg<U+00E9>'s first masterpiece.<ref name="Mills" /> 	 
 		 
Other changes to the mechanics of creating the strip were forced on Herg<U+00E9> by outside events. The Second World War and the [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of Belgium]] by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s armies saw the closure of the newspaper in which Tintin was serialised. Work was halted on ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', and the already published ''[[Tintin in America]]'' and ''[[The Black Island]]'' were banned by the [[History of Belgium#World War II|Nazi]] censors, who were concerned at their presentation of [[United States|America]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. However, Herg<U+00E9> was able to continue with Tintin's adventures, publishing four books and serialising two more adventures in a [[Nazi Germany|German]]-licensed newspaper.<ref name="Mills" /> 

During and after the German occupation Herg<U+00E9> was accused of being a [[collaborator]] because of the [[Nazi]] control of the paper ({{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}}), and he was briefly taken for interrogation after the war. He claimed that he was simply doing a job under the occupation, like a plumber or carpenter. His work of this period, unlike earlier and later work, is politically neutral and resulted in classic adventure stories such as ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' and ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', but the apocalyptic ''[[The Shooting Star]]'' reflects the foreboding Herg<U+00E9> felt during this uncertain political period.
 		 
A post-war paper shortage forced changes in the format of the books. Herg<U+00E9> had usually allowed the stories to develop to a length that suited the story, but with paper now in short supply, publishers [[Casterman]] asked Herg<U+00E9> to consider using smaller panel sizes and adopt an arbitrary length of 62 pages. Herg<U+00E9> took on more staff (the first ten books having been produced by himself and his wife), eventually building a [[studio]] system.
		 
The adoption of [[color printing|color]] allowed Herg<U+00E9> to expand the scope of the works. His use of color was more advanced than that of American comics of the time, with better production values allowing a combination of the [[CMYK color model|four printing shades]] and thus a [[cinematography|cinematographic]] approach to lighting and shading. Herg<U+00E9> and his studio would allow images to fill half pages or more, simply to detail and accentuate the scene, using colour to emphasise important points.<ref name="Mills" /> Herg<U+00E9> notes this fact, stating "I consider my stories as movies. No narration, no descriptions, emphasis is given to images."<ref name="bbc">{{cite web | date= [[December 15]] [[2005]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4534602.stm|title=Faces of the week|work=[[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> 	 
	 
Herg<U+00E9>'s personal life also affected the series, with ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' heavily influenced by his [[nervous breakdown]]. His [[nightmare]]s, which he reportedly described as being "all white",<ref name="Mills" /> are reflected in the snowy landscapes. The plot has Tintin set off in search of [[Chang Chong-Chen]], previously seen in ''The Blue Lotus'', and the piece contains no villains and little moral judgement, with Herg<U+00E9> even refusing to refer to the [[Yeti|Snowman of the Himalayas]] as "abominable".<ref name="Mills" /> 	 
	 
The conclusion of Tintin's adventures was untimely. Herg<U+00E9>'s death on [[March 3]] [[1983]] left the twenty-fourth and final adventure, ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'', unfinished. The plot saw Tintin embroiled in the world of [[modern art]], and the story ended with him apparently about to be killed, encased in [[acrylic glass|perspex]] and presented as a work of art.<ref>[[Jean-Marc Lofficier|Lofficier]], Jean-Marc & Randy (2002) ''The Pocket Essential Tintin'' - ISBN 1-904048-17-X</ref>

==Characters==
===Tintin and Snowy===
{{main|Tintin and Snowy}}

[[Image:Tintin&Snowy.png|thumb|right|[[Tintin and Snowy]], detail of a panel from the book ''[[The Black Island]]'' by [[Herg<U+00E9>]], 1965]] 
<!-- FAIR USE of Tintin&Snowy.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tintin&Snowy.png for rationale -->
Tintin is a young Belgian [[journalist|reporter]] who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes [[hero]]ic action to save the day. Almost every adventure features Tintin hard at work at his [[investigative journalism|investigative reporting]], but he is rarely seen actually turning in a story without first getting caught up in some misadventure. He is a young man of more or less neutral attitudes and is less colourful than the supporting cast. In this respect, he represents the [[everyman]].

Snowy, a white [[Fox terrier]], is Tintin's four-legged companion. They regularly save each other from perilous situations. Snowy frequently "speaks" to the reader through his thoughts (often displaying a dry sense of humour), which are supposedly not heard by the characters in the story except in Tintin in America where he explains Tintin about his absence for a period of time in the book.

Like Captain Haddock, Snowy is fond of the ''[[Loch Lomond Single Malt|Loch Lomond]]'' brand of [[whisky]], and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble, as does his raging [[arachnophobia]]. The French name of Snowy, "Milou", has nothing to do with snow or the color white. It has been widely credited as an oblique reference to a girlfriend from Herg<U+00E9>'s youth, Marie-Louise Van Cutsem, whose nickname was "Milou".<ref name="Kuife75">{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/kuifje/12.asp| title=Achter de mythe van 'Kuifje in het land van de Sovjets'|language=Dutch|date=1999-02-06|accessdate = 1[[5 September]]|accessyear=2006|author=Jan Bex}}</ref><!--secondary source in Portuguese:http://a-arca.uol.com.br/v2/artigosdt.asp?sec=5&ssec=33&cdn=4344-->

Another explanation to the origins of the two characters is possible. The first 3 adventures of Tintin visit places originally visited by photographer-reporter Robert Sex<U+00E9>, recorded in the Belgian press from the mid to late 1920s. At that time Sex<U+00E9> had made numerous trips round the world on a motorcycle, in collaboration with Grand-Prix champion and motorcycle record holder Ren<U+00E9> Milhoux, and these trips were highly publicised at the time. Sex<U+00E9> has also been noted to have a similar appearance to Tintin, and the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]] in Belgium has admitted that it is not too hard to imagine how Herg<U+00E9> could have been influenced by the exploits of Sex<U+00E9>.<ref>"Writer tracks down Tintin's real life inspiration" ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Manchester); May 17, 1999; Paul Webster; p. 15</ref>  In 1996, a biography of Robert Sex<U+00E9> by Janpol Schulz was published, titled "Sex<U+00E9> au pays des Soviets" (Sex<U+00E9> in the Land of the Soviets) to mimic the name of the first Tintin Adventure. <ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.vendee.fr/vendee/actualites/default.asp%3Fart%3D1649&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=4&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Sex%25C3%25A9%2Bau%2Bpays%2Bdes%2Bsoviets%2522%2BJanpol%2BSchulz%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG/ The Vend<U+00E9>en Tintin], automated translation from Le journal de la Vend<U+00E9>e, 16 April 2007</ref>

===Captain Haddock===
{{main|Captain Haddock}}

[[Image:CaptainHaddock.png|thumb|100px|left|[[Captain Haddock]]]]
<!-- FAIR USE of CaptainHaddock.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CaptainHaddock.png for rationale -->
Captain Archibald Haddock, a seafaring captain of disputed ancestry (he may be of English, French or Belgian origin), is Tintin's best friend, and was introduced in ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]''. Haddock was initially depicted as a weak and [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] character, but later became more respectable. He evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, ''Sir Francis Haddock'' (''Fran<U+00E7>ois de Hadoque'' in French), in the episode ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]''. The Captain's coarse humanity and [[sarcasm]] act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic.
Captain Haddock lives in his luxurious mansion called [[Marlinspike Hall]] ("Moulinsart" in the original French).

Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as "billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles", "ten thousand thundering typhoons", "[[troglodyte]]s", "[[bashi-bazouk]]", "[[kleptomania]]c", "[[ectoplasm]]", "sea [[gherkin]]", "[[anacoluthon]]", and "[[pockmark]]", but nothing that is actually considered a [[profanity|swear word]]. Haddock is a hard drinker, particularly fond of ''[[Loch Lomond]]'' whisky, and his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect.<!--  ''See also: '' [[List of exclamations used by Captain Haddock]] -->

Herg<U+00E9> stated that Haddock's surname was derived from a "sad English [[fish]] that drinks a lot".<ref name="guardian" /><!--Can't find a reference that matches this exactly:Haddock's surname was derived from a conversation that Herg<U+00E9> had with his wife, in which she mentioned that the [[haddock]] was a "sad English fish that drinks a lot". Herg<U+00E9> chose this name accordingly.--> Haddock remained without a first name until the last completed story, ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]'' (1976), when the name ''Archibald'' was suggested.

===Supporting characters===
{{main|Secondary characters and settings in The Adventures of Tintin}}

Herg<U+00E9>'s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with a strength of character and depth of personality which has been compared with that of the characters of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name="ZeroHero">{{cite news | first=Tom | last=McCarthy | pages=4 | title=Review: From zero to hero | date=[[July 1]] [[2006]] | publisher=The Guardian | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1809827,00.html }}</ref> Herg<U+00E9> used the supporting characters to create a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. It has been speculated that the occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Herg<U+00E9> forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. The major supporting cast was developed during this period.<ref name=ninthart>{{cite web | last=Yusuf | first=Bulent|date=[[November 14]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=1123 | title=Alphabetti Fumetti: H is for Herg<U+00E9> | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

* '''[[Professor Cuthbert Calculus]]''' ({{lang|fr|Professeur Tryphon Tournesol}} {Prof. Sunflower} in French), an [[Absent-minded professor|absent-minded]] and half-deaf [[physicist]], is a minor but regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. Introduced in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', and based partially on [[Auguste Piccard]],<ref name=submarinehistory>{{cite web | last=Mauron | first=Pascal | url=http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&q=http://www.brazosport.cc.tx.us/~nstevens/patches/swiss_sub/Piccards.pdf |title=A small history of Swiss submarines | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> his appearance was initially not welcomed by the leading characters, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability he develops a lasting bond with them.

* '''[[Thomson and Thompson]]''' ({{lang|fr|Dupont et Dupond}}) are two bumbling [[detective]]s who, although unrelated,<ref name="FarrCompanion"/> look like [[twin]]s with the only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches.<ref name=thompson>{{cite web | url=http://tintin.eugraph.com/tqsect/feature/tvst|title=How to tell a Thompson from a Thomson |accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> They provide much of the [[comic relief]] throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic [[spoonerism]] and shown to be thoroughly incompetent. The detectives were in part based on Herg<U+00E9>'s father and uncle, identical twins who wore matching [[bowler hat|bowlers]]. 

* '''[[Bianca Castafiore]]''' is an opera singer whom Haddock absolutely despises. However, she seems to constantly be popping up wherever they go, along with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Her name means "white and chaste flower", something Prof. Calculus understands when he offers a white rose to the singer he's secretly in love with in ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]''. She was based upon opera [[diva]]s in general (according to Herg<U+00E9>'s perception), Herg<U+00E9>'s Aunt Ninie, and in the post-war comics on [[Maria Callas]].<ref name="Farr" />

* Other recurring characters include '''[[Nestor (Tintin character)|Nestor]]''' the butler, '''[[General Alcazar]]''' the South American dictator, '''[[Jolyon Wagg]]''' an insurance salesman, '''[[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah|Kalish Ezab]]''' the emir, '''[[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah|Abdullah]]''' the emir's son, '''[[Chang Chong-Chen|Chang]]''' the Chinese boy, '''[[Dr. J.W. M<U+00FC>ller|M<U+00FC>ller]]''' the evil German doctor, and '''[[Rastapopoulos]]''' the criminal mastermind.  Strangely, no young women feature as any main or side characters, and in fact only occasionally feature in the background.

==Settings==
The settings within ''Tintin'' have also added depth to the strips. Herg<U+00E9> mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, along with a base in [[Belgium]] from where the heroes set off. This is originally 26 Labrador Road, but later [[Marlinspike Hall]]. This is best demonstrated in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'', in which Herg<U+00E9> creates two fictional countries ([[Syldavia]] and [[Borduria]]) and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline.<ref name="Thompson250"/> Other fictional lands include [[San Theodoros]], [[San Paolo]] and Nuevo Rico in South America, the kingdom or [[administrative region]] of Gaipajama in India and Khemed in the Middle East. Along with these fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, England, Soviet Union, United States, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Sahara Desert, Indonesia, Tibet, China and Japan. Another setting was the [[Moon]], and in the first edition of ''Land of Black Gold'', [[Palestine]], though this was later replaced by the fictional Khemed.

==Creating the works==

===Research===
Herg<U+00E9>'s extensive research began with ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', Herg<U+00E9> stating: "it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers."<ref>{{cite book | last=Gravett | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Gravett | year=2005 | title=Graphic Novels: Stories to Change Your Life | edition= | publisher=Aurum | id=ISBN 1-84513-068-5 }}</ref>

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific [[politics|political]] cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Herg<U+00E9> saw [[monarchy]] as "the legitimate form of government", noting that [[democracy|democratic]] "values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip."<ref>Skilling, Pierre (2005). "The Good Government According to Tintin." In Jeff (EDT) McLaughlin (Ed.) ''Comics As Philosophy'' pp. 173<U+2013>234. University Press of Mississippi ISBN 1-57806-794-4</ref> Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Herg<U+00E9> creating a history, customs, and language. He set the country in the [[Balkans]], and it is, by his own admission, modeled after [[Albania]].<ref>Letter from Herg<U+00E9> to Charles Lesne, [[12 June]] [[1939]], cit. Assouline, Pierre (1996) ''Herg<U+00E9>'', Folio (p218)</ref> The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring [[Borduria]] with an attempted annexation appearing in ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]''. This situation parallels the [[Italian conquest of Albania]] and of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Austria]] by expansionist [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[World War II]].<ref name="defense">{{cite web|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/defence.html|title=In Defence of Herg<U+00E9>|publisher=Vicious magazine/tintinologist.org|author=Garen Ewing|date=1995|accessdate = 2006-09-15}}</ref>

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin's voyage to the moon in the two-part storyline spread across ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]'' and ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''. His research for the storyline was noted in ''[[New Scientist]]'': "[T]he considerable research undertaken by Herg<U+00E9> enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future [[Exploration of the Moon|Moon exploration]], although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark.". The moon rocket is based on the German [[V2 rocket]]s.<ref>"Welcome to the Moon, Mr Armstrong". Pain, Stephanie ''[[New Scientist]]''. Vol. 182, no. 2441, pp. 48<U+2013>49. [[3 April]]. 2004</ref>

===Influences===
In his youth Herg<U+00E9> admired [[Benjamin Rabier]] and suggested that a number of images within ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' reflected this influence, particularly the pictures of animals. [[Ren<U+00E9> Vincent]], the [[Art Deco]] designer, also had an impact on early Tintin adventures: "His influence can be detected at the beginning of the ''Soviets'', where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an 'S'...".<ref name=lc>{{cite web|url=http://www.chez.com/tintim/ligneclaire/ligne_1.htm|title=Herg<U+00E9> et la ligne claire|language=French|accessdate = 2006-09-15}}</ref> Herg<U+00E9> also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the round noses from [[George McManus]], feeling they were "so much fun that I used them, without scruples!"<ref name="TCJInterview">{{cite journal | last =Sadoul  | first =Numa  | authorlink =Numa Sadoul  | coauthors =trans.

During the extensive research Herg<U+00E9> carried out for ''The Blue Lotus'', he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and [[woodcut]]s. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.objectiftintin.com/whatsnew_Tintin_2868.lasso|title=Herg<U+00E9>, un grand dessinateur paysagiste|language=French|author=G.

Herg<U+00E9> also declared [[Mark Twain]] an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting [[Inca Empire|Incas]] as having no knowledge of an upcoming eclipse in ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'', an error attributed by T.F. Mills to an attempt to portray "Incas in awe of a latter-day '[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|Connecticut Yankee]]'".<ref name="Mills" />

==Criticisms of the series==
The earliest stories in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' have been criticised for [[racism|racist]], violent, [[colonialism|colonialist]], animal cruelty and even [[fascism|fascist]] leanings, including caricatured portrayals of non-[[Europe]]ans. The Tintin series originated as a comic strip in the "Petit Vingtieme" journal. Whilst the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation has presented such criticism as na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>,<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Harry | authorlink=Harry Thompson | year=1991 | title=Tintin: Herg<U+00E9> & His Creation | edition=First | publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|id=ISBN 0-340-52393-X }}</ref> and scholars of Herg<U+00E9> such as Harry Thompson have claimed "Herg<U+00E9> did what he was told by the [[Norbert Wallez|Abb<U+00E9> Wallez]]",<ref name="Thompson"/> Herg<U+00E9> himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice: "I was fed the prejudices of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society that surrounded me."<ref name="TCJInterview"/>

In ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', the [[Bolsheviks]] were presented as villains. Herg<U+00E9> drew on ''Moscow Unveiled'', a work given to him by Wallez and authored by [[Joseph Douillet]], the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the Soviet regime, although Herg<U+00E9> contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] nation, "Anything Bolshevik was [[atheism|atheist]]".<ref name="TCJInterview"/> In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated only by personal greed and Tintin discovers, buried, the "hidden treasure of Lenin and Trotsky". Herg<U+00E9> later dismissed the failings of this first story as "a transgression of my youth".<ref name="Thompson" /> But by 1999 some part of this presentation was being noted as far more reasonable, ''[[The Economist]]'' declaring: "In retrospect, however, the land of hunger and tyranny painted by Herge was uncannily accurate".<ref>"Moreover: Great blistering barnacles" ''[[The Economist]]'' (London); [[30 January]] [[1999]]; p. 79</ref>

''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'' has been criticised as presenting the [[Belgian Congo|Africans]] as na<U+00EF>ve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children. "Mes chers amis," he says, "je vais vous parler aujourd'hui de votre patrie: La Belgique" ("My dear friends, I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium"). Herg<U+00E9> redrew this in 1946 to a lesson in [[mathematics]]. Herg<U+00E9> later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it by noting: "I portrayed these Africans according to ... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time".<ref name="TCJInterview" /> The perceived problems with this book were summarised by Sue Buswell in 1988<ref>''Mail on Sunday'' Associated Newspapers 27.11.1988</ref> as being "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals" although Thompson noted this quote may have been "taken out of context".<ref name="Thompson" /> "Dead animals" refers to the fashion for big game hunting at the time of work's original publication. Drawing on [[Andr<U+00E9> Maurois]]' ''Les Silences du colonel Bramble'', Herg<U+00E9> presents Tintin as a [[big-game hunter]], bagging 15 [[antelope]] as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals did lead the Scandinavian publishers of Tintin's adventures to request changes. A page which presented Tintin killing a [[rhinoceros]] by drilling a hole in the animal's back and inserting a stick of [[dynamite]] was deemed excessive, and Herg<U+00E9> substituted a page which saw the rhino accidentally discharge Tintin's rifle whilst the erstwhile hunter snoozed under a tree.<ref name="FarrCompanion">[[Michael Farr]] ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', John Murray (2001) ISBN 0-7195-5522-1</ref> In 2007 the UK's [[Commission for Racial Equality]] called for the book to be pulled from the shelves after a complaint, stating that "it beggars belief that in this day and age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display 'Tintin In The Congo'."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6294670.stm |title='Bid to ban "racist" Tintin book' on the BBC News website |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0vq.RefLocID-0hg00900c002.Lang-EN.htm |title=CRE statement on the children's book 'Tintin In The Congo' on the CRE website |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> In August 2007, a complaint was filed in Brussels, Belgium, by a Congolese student, claiming the book was an insult to the Congolese people.

Some of the early albums were altered by Herg<U+00E9> in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers. For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the black characters in ''[[Tintin in America]]'' were re-coloured to make their race white or ambiguous.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/special/essays/tbibeng.htm|title = The Adventures of Tintin: A History of the Anglo-American Editions|author=T.F.Mills|date=1996-02-01|accessdate = 2006-09-14}}</ref> ''The Shooting Star'' album originally had an [[United States|American]] villain with the [[Jew]]ish surname of Mr. Blumenstein. This proved to be controversial, as the character looked very [[stereotype|stereotypically]] Jewish. Blumenstein was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]], in later editions and subsequently to a [[South America]]n of a [[fictional country]] - [[S<U+00E3>o Rico]]. Herg<U+00E9> later discovered that 'Bohlwinkel' was also a Jewish name.<ref name="defense" />

==Adaptations and exhibitions==
{{main|Tintin books, films, and media}}
''The Adventures of Tintin'' have been adapted in a variety of [[mass media|media]] besides the original comic strip and its collections. Herg<U+00E9> encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films. After Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]] became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.<ref name=tintin.com>{{cite web | url=http://tintin.francetv.fr/uk/ | title=Tintin.com | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

===Films===
There have been both [[live action|live-action]] and [[animation|animated]] film adaptations of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. 

*''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (1947) - animated, based on the book.
*''[[Tintin and the Golden Fleece]]'' (1961) - live action, developed from an original script. 
*''[[Tintin and the Blue Oranges]]'' (1964) - live action, developed from an original script. 
*''[[Tintin and the Temple of the Sun]]'' (1969) - animated, based on the book.
* ''Tintin et la SGM'' (1970), animated promotional short film by [[Belvision]] (10', see [http://www.lardc.com/zaire/divers/cs_tintin.php]).
*''[[Tintin and the Lake of Sharks]]'' (1972) - based on an original script and subsequently adapted into comic book form<!--looks to be true but can't find a source apart from this:http://perso.orange.fr/prad/themes/superheros/clown2.htm: , much to Herge's annoyance{{Fact|date=January 2008}}-->.

[[Steven Spielberg]] bought an option on the [[Tintin and Snowy|Tintin]] characters shortly before Herg<U+00E9>'s death in 1983. However, at that point Spielberg was not confirmed to be directing and hence Herg<U+00E9> refused to sign the contract.<ref>{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Cendrowicz |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003556086 |title = DreamWorks to film comic hero Tintin |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=[[2007-03-09]] |accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> In November 2002, Dreamworks bought the film rights to the Tintin series.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tintin 'to become movie hero' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2002-11-22]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2502495.stm |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> Spielberg is collaborating with [[Peter Jackson]] for a [[motion capture]] film trilogy, starring [[Thomas Sangster]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Brown|title=Blistering barnacles!

===Documentaries===
Two documentaries have been made about Tintin and his creator [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. 
* ''[[I, Tintin]]'' (1966), a French documentary
* ''[[Tintin and I]]'' ({{lang|fr|''Tintin et Moi''}}), by Danish director Anders H<U+00F8>gsbro <U+00D8>stergaard in 2003, a co-production of companies from [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], and [[Switzerland]]. This documentary was based on a taped interview with Herg<U+00E9> by [[Numa Sadoul]] from 1971. Although the interview was published as a book, Herg<U+00E9> was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised. <ref name=boyscout>{{cite web | last=Christensen | first=Af | date=November 2003 | url=http://www.dfi.dk/tidsskriftetfilm/32/boyscout.htm | title=Boy scout with strange dreams - "Tintin et moi"|accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> The documentary was broadcast in the United States as "Tintin and I" on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network, [[July 11]] [[2006]].<ref name=pbs>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/tintinandi/index.html | title=''Tintin'' and I at PBS | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

===Television===
Two animated television series have been made, both adaptations of the comic strips rather than original stories. 

The first was ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'', produced by [[Belvision Studios|Belvision]]. The series aired from 1958 to 1962, with 104 five-minute episodes produced. It was adapted by [[Charles Shows]] and then translated into French by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] (Michel Regnier), then editor-in-chief of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine. This series has been criticised for differing too greatly from the original books and for its poor animation.<ref name=pbs />

The second series was ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', featuring 21 of the stories. It ran for three seasons (from 1991 to 1992) and was co-directed by [[St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi]], and [[Peter Hudecki]], and produced by [[L<U+00E9> Studio Ellipse|Ellipse]] (France), and [[Nelvana Limited|Nelvana]] (Canada), on behalf of La Fondation Herg<U+00E9>. Traditional animation techniques were used on the series, adhering closely to the books  - some frames from the original albums were transposed directly to screen. The series has aired in over 50 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?languageParameter=en&pageid=contentPage&docId=25548

===Theatre===
Herg<U+00E9> helped to create two Tintin stage plays: ''Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond'' (1941) and ''The Disappearance of Mr. Boullock'' (1941&ndash;1942). These were written with [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]] and performed in [[Brussels]]. 

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays appeared at [[London]], adapted by Geoffrey Case for the [[Unicorn Theatre Company]]. They were: ''Tintin's Great American Adventure'', based on the comic ''[[Tintin in America]]'', which was shown 1976&ndash;1977; and ''Tintin and the Black Island'', based on ''[[The Black Island]]'', and shown in 1980. This second play later went on tour.

A [[musical theater|musical]] based on ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' and ''Prisoners of the Sun'' premi<U+00E8>red on [[15 September]] [[2001]] at the ''Stadsschouwburg'' (city theatre) in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. It was entitled ''[[Kuifje - De Zonnetempel (De Musical)]]'' and was broadcast on [[Canal Plus]], before moving on to [[Charleroi]] in 2002 as ''[[Tintin - Le Temple du Soleil - Le Spectacle Musical|Tintin &mdash; Le Temple du Soleil]]''.

The [[Young Vic]] theatre company ran a musical version of ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' at the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] in London from December 2005 to January 2006.<ref name=youngvic>{{cite web | url=http://www.youngvic.org/press-releases | title=Rufus Norris to direct World Premiere of Tintin the Young Vic Christmas production at the Barbican Theatre|accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> The production was directed by [[Rufus Norris]], and was adapted by Norris and [[David Greig (dramatist)|David Greig]].<ref name="youngvic" /> The Herg<U+00E9> Foundation organised the return of this show to the [[West End theatre|West End]] in December 2006 and January 2007 in order to celebrate the Herg<U+00E9> centenary (2007).

===Unofficial comic books===
{{main|List of Tintin parodies and pastiches}}

Various unofficial comics have also been released, ranging from illegal [[copyright infringement|pirated]] versions of original albums to [[pastiche]]s and [[parody|parodies]], including  the [[anarchy|anarchist]] ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free|Breaking Free]]'' and  the pornographic ''[[Tintin in Thailand]]'', which reportedly circulated from December 1999 onwards. <ref name=bbc2>{{cite web | date=[[February 14]] [[2001]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1170301.stm|title=Lewd ''Tintin'' shocks Belgium|work=[[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

[[Yves Rodier]] has produced a number of Tintin works, none authorised by the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation, including a 1986 "completion" of the unfinished ''Tintin and Alph-art''. 

===Exhibitions===

Herg<U+00E9>'s work on Tintin has formed the basis of many exhibitions, with the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation creating a mobile exhibition in 1991. "The World of Herg<U+00E9>" is described by the Foundation as being "an excellent introduction to Herg<U+00E9>'s work". Materials from this exhibition have also formed the basis for larger shows, namely "Herg<U+00E9> the Draughtsman", an exhibition to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Tintin's creation, and the more recent "In Tibet With Tintin". In 2001 the [[Mus<U+00E9>e de la Marine]] staged an exhibition of items related to the sea which had inspired Herg<U+00E9>. In 2002 the [[Bunkamura Museum of Art]] in Japan staged an exhibition of original drawings, as well as the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus. [[Barcelona]] has also hosted an exhibition on Tintin and the sea, "llamp de rellamp" at the Maritime Museum in 2003.<ref name="tintin.com" />

2004 saw exhibitions in Holland, "Tintin and the Incas" at the [[Royal Museum of Ethnology]]; the "Tintin in the City" exhibition in the [[Halles Saint G<U+00E9>ry]] in Brussels; and an exhibition focusing on Tintin's exploits at sea at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in London.<ref name="tintin.com" /> The latter exhibition was in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin's first adventure, and was organised in partnership with the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation.<ref name=nationalmaritime>{{cite web | url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.11356 | title=The Adventures of Tintin at Sea - a major new exhibition at the National Maritime Museum|accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref> 2004 also saw the [[Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art]] add an area dedicated to Herg<U+00E9>.<ref name="tintin.com" />

The 100th anniversary of Herg<U+00E9>'s birth is commemorated with a large exhibition at the [[Paris]] museum for contemporary arts, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], from [[December 20]] [[2006]] until [[February 19]] [[2007]], featuring a.o. all 120 original pages of ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061220/ts_afp/afpentertainmentfrancebelgiumexhibitioncartoontintin Yahoo News on Pompidou exhibition]</ref>

==Memorabilia and merchandise==
[[Image:Tintin's dog.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Soft toy versions of Snowy ''(Milou)'']]

Images from the series have long been [[license]]d for use on [[merchandise]]; the success of the ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine helping to create a market for such items.  Tintin's image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants.<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Conrad | pages= | title=He'll never act his age | date=Sunday [[March 7]] [[2004]]|publisher=The Observer|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1163706,00.html }}</ref> There are now estimated to be over 250 separate items related to the character available, with some becoming [[collectible|collectors]] items in their own right.<ref>"Tintin and the till bells; Shopping"

Since Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]] have maintained control of the licenses, through Moulinsart, the [[profit|commercial]] wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: "We have to be very protective of the property. We don<U+2019>t take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective ... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use."<ref>{{cite press release | title =Tintin praises volunteer efforts | publisher =Dyslexia International &mdash; Tools and Technologies | date = | url =http://www.ditt-online.org/Archives/DITT%20Newsletter%20No9.pdf|accessdate = 2006-09-02 }}</ref> However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as "trivialising the work of Herge by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising" in the wake of a move in the late nineties to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.<ref>"This life: That's Tintin on the far right A battle is raging for Tintin's soul.

[[NBC Universal]] acquired the rights to all of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' merchandise in [[North America]].

===Shops===
[[Image:Tintin Shop.jpg|150px|thumb|The Tintin Shop in Covent Garden, London]]

Tintin [[memorabilia]] and merchandise has allowed a [[chain store|chain]] of stores based solely on the character to become viable. The first shop was launched by Jane Taylor in 1984, located in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]], and there are now branches worldwide, including two in Belgium, located in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. The British bookstore chain, [[Ottakars]] was named after King Ottokar, from the Tintin book [[King Ottokar's Sceptre]], and their shops stock a large amount of Tintin merchandise.<ref>"Tintin Among The Geriatrics Kitty Holland celebrates the 70th birthday of Belgium's favourite son, and France's beloved adoptee, Tintin" ''[[Irish Times]]'' (Dublin); [[9 January]] [[1999]]; p. 62</ref> There are also a number of Tintin themed caf<U+00E9>s located around the world.

===Stamps===

{{main|Tintin on postage stamps}}

Tintin's image has been used on [[postage stamp]]s on numerous occasions,<ref>[http://www.rlambert.be/kuifje.htm Images of different Tintin stamps]</ref> the first issued by the [[Belgian Post Group|Belgian Post]] in 1979<ref>{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Kennealy | pages= | title=Comics Characters Beloved by Brussels | date=[[September 29]] [[1991]]|publisher=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9D0CE7DD143AF93AA1575AC0A967958260 }}</ref> to celebrate the day of youth [[philately]]. This was the first in a series of stamps with the images of [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic heroes]], and was the first stamp in the world to feature a comic hero.

In 1999, the [[TNT N.V.|Royal Dutch Post]] released two stamps on [[October 8]] [[1999]], based upon the ''[[Destination Moon]]'' adventure, with the stamps selling out within hours of release. The French post office, [[Poste Fran<U+00E7>aise]], then issued a stamp of Tintin and Snowy in 2001. To mark the end of the Belgian Franc, and also to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', two more stamps were issued by the Belgian Post on [[December 31]] [[2001]]. The stamps were also issued in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|The Congo]] at the same time. 2002 saw the French Post issue stamped envelopes featuring Tintin, whilst in 2004 the Belgian post-office celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'' and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the moon landings with a series of stamps based upon the ''Explorers on the Moon'' adventure.<ref>"Tintin celebrates 75th birthday in Belgium" ''[[Irish Times]]'' (Dublin); [[10 January]] [[2004]]; TIM KING; p. 9.</ref> In 2007, to celebrate Herg<U+00E9>'s centennial, Belgium, France and Switzerland all plan to issue special stamps in commemoration.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last=AP | pages= | title=Tintin creator's centenary|date=[[May 24]] [[2006]] | publisher=The Age | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/tintin-creators-anniversary/2006/05/24/1148150265203.html }}</ref>

===Coins===
Besides stamps, Tintin has also been [[Commemorative coins of Belgium|commemorated by coin]] several times. In 1995, [[Monnaie de Paris]] issued a set of 12 coins to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Herge's death, made of silver, and in a limited edition of 5000. Another coin was released to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'', in a limited run of 10,000. Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative coin to celebrate the 75th birthday of Tintin in January of 2004.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | pages= | title=Euro coin honours Tintin and Snowy | date=Thursday, [[8 January]] [[2004]] | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3379959.stm }}</ref> The coin, composed of silver and featuring Tintin and Snowy, was limited to a minting of 50 000. Although it has a face value of <U+20AC>10, it is, as with other commemorative euro coins of this type (i.e. not a commemorative issue of a standard [[euro coins|euro coin]]), only legal tender in the country in which it was issued (in this case, Belgium).

===Books===
{{main|List of books about Tintin}}

A large number of books have been published about Tintin.

==Translation into English==
The process of [[translating]] Tintin into English was a complex affair, commissioned in 1958 by [[Methuen|Methuen & Co. Ltd.]] of London. It was a joint-operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, who worked closely with [[Herg<U+00E9>]] to attain an accurate translation as true as possible to the original work.<ref name="trans">{{cite web|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/mt-llc-interview.html|title=Interview with Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper|author=Chris Owens|publisher=tintinologist.org|date=2004-07-10|accessdate = 2006-09-15}}</ref> The works were also sold in the [[United States|American]] market by [[Golden Books]], a branch of the [[Western Publishing Company]] in the 1950s. The albums were translated from French into [[American English]] with some blocks blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and racial stereotyping.<ref name="changes">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/TINTIN.html|title=TINTIN|author=|publisher=CWI| accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The albums were not very popular and only six were published in mixed order.<ref name="changes2">{{cite web|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/goldenpress.html|title=Tintin crosses the Atlantic: The Golden Press affair|author=|publisher=tintinologist.org| accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> The edited albums later had their blanked blocks redrawn by Herg<U+00E9> to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world. [[The Atlantic Monthly|Atlantic Monthly Press]], in cooperation with [[Little, Brown and Company]] beginning in the 1970s, published the albums again. This time, the text features the originally translated [[British English]] text with alterations to localized British words such as [[gaol]], [[tire|tyre]], [[sedan|saloon]] and [[spanner]]. Currently, they are being published under the Joy Street imprint of Little, Brown and Company.

Due in part to the large amount of language-specific [[wordplay]] (such as [[pun]]ning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on [[Professor Calculus]]' partial deafness, it was always the intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right; however, in spite of the free hand Herg<U+00E9> afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Herg<U+00E9>'s intentions.<ref name="trans" />

More than simple translations, however, the English versions were anglicised to appeal to British customs and values. Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators' discretion. Moreover, the translation process served to colour the imagery within the book; the opportunity was taken to make scenes set in Britain more true-to-life, such as ensuring that the British police were [[Uniforms and equipment of the British police#Firearms and weapons|free from firearms]], and ensuring scenes of the British [[countryside]] were more accurate for discerning British readers.<ref name="trans" /> Because the translated text was placed into the original [[speech balloon]]s without alteration to their original dimensions, the [[linguistics|linguistic]] differences between the two languages (meaning that certain phrases were either significantly shorter or longer in the English language) led to the unexpectedly empty or full balloons which can often be seen in the English versions of the books.<ref name=history />

==Legacy==
Tintin and his creator [[Herg<U+00E9>]] have inspired many artists within comics. Most notably, Herg<U+00E9>'s [[ligne claire]] style has proven influential. Contributors to the ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine have employed ligne claire, and more recently, [[Jacques Tardi]], [[Yves Chaland]], [[Jason Little (cartoonist)|Jason Little]], [[Phil Elliott]], [[Martin Handford]], [[Geoff Darrow]] and [[Garen Ewing]] have produced works utilising it.

Tintin's legacy includes the establishment of a market for comic strip collections; the serialisation followed by collection model has been adopted by creators and publishers in France and Belgium. This system allows for greater financial stability, as creators receive money whilst working. This rivals the American and British model of [[work for hire]]. [[Roger Sabin]] has argued that this model allowed for "in theory ... a better quality product."<ref>{{cite book | last=Sabin | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Sabin | year=1996 | title= Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels| edition=2005|publisher=Phaidon|id=ISBN 0-7148-3993-0  }}</ref> [[Paul Gravett]] has also noted that the use of detailed reference material and a picture archive, which Herg<U+00E9> implemented from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onwards, was "a turning point ... in the maturing of the medium as a whole."<ref name="STCYL"/>

In the wider art world, both [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] have claimed Herg<U+00E9> as one of their most important influences. Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin's comics, whilst Warhol utilised the ligne claire and even made a series of paintings with Herg<U+00E9> as subject. He declared: "Herge has influenced my work in the same way as [[Walt Disney]]. For me, Herge was more than a comic strip artist."<ref name=bbc3>{{cite web | date=[[January 10]] [[1999]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/252066.stm|title=Tintin's 70 years of adventure|work=[[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}</ref>

In music, Tintin has been the inspiration to a number of bands and musicians. A British technopop band of the 1980s took the name [[The Thompson Twins]] after the Tintin characters. [[Stephen Duffy]], a former member of [[Duran Duran]], performed the minor hit single "Kiss Me" under the name "Tintin"; he had to drop the name under pressure of a copyright infringement suit. Duffy would later release the album ''Designer Beatnik'' under the name "Doctor Calculus" in reference to [[Professor Calculus]]. An Australian [[psychedelic rock]] band and an American independent [[progressive rock]] band have used the name "[[Tin Tin]]", and British electronic dance music duo [[Tin Tin Out]] was similarly inspired by the character. South African singer/songwriter [[Gert Vlok Nel]] compares Tintin to God in his [[Afrikaans]] song "Waarom ek roep na jou vanaand", presumably because Tintin is such a morally pure character.  Australian cartoonist [[Bill Leak]] often portrays the bespectacled neophyte Australian [[prime minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] as Tintin.

Herg<U+00E9> has been lauded as "creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century's tortured history" through his work on Tintin.<ref name=pbs2>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/tintinandi/about.html | title=Tintin and I.
