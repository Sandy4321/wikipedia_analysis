Burke began dance classes at a very early age, and began singing when she was as young as five years old. She went onto to sing on stage at the [[Bahrain]] when she was only nine years old, where she sang with her mother, who was still in band [[Soul II Soul]].<ref name="xfactor.itv.com"/> When she was aged twelve, Burke entered the television talent show, ''Star for a Night'' she became the youngest person in the competition. Throughout the competition, she was the runner-up after she was beaten for the winners title by [[Joss Stone]].<ref name="xfactor.itv.com"/> Still at the age of twelve, her mother put her in contact with [[Stevie Wonder]] who rang Burke and she sang down the phone to him. Her mother, Bell, also asked her to sing to [[Jean Carne]] who was said to be very impressed by Burke's vocals that she asked her to perform with her at one of her shows the next night. Burke attended [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School]] in Islington, Angel where she worked for her [[Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], once she achieved her GCSEs Burke left school to pursue a career in the [[music industry]].

===2005<U+2013>09:''The X Factor'' era===
Burke auditioned for the second series of ''The X Factor'' in 2005 (which was eventually won by [[Shayne Ward]]). She made it through to the final seven in [[Louis Walsh]]'s 16<U+2013>24 category, effectively the top 21 of the competition; however, Walsh did not choose her for his final four as he felt that she was too young for the competition. Burke however did not give up and went on to seek professional singing lessons over the next three years, proving her dedication and commitment to becoming a popstar.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexandra Buke All Night Long Tour 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Burke performing during her tour.]] -->
Burke's second bid to win ''The X Factor'' came in 2008. Falling into the "Girls" category, she was mentored by [[Girls Aloud]]'s [[Cheryl Cole]] who selected her for the finals<U+2014>a series of ten weekly live shows in which contestants are progressively eliminated by public vote. On the first live show, Burke performed [[Whitney Houston]]'s classic "[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody]]". For the second live show she covered "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" by [[The Jackson 5]]. In week three, [[big band]] week, Burke performed [[Christina Aguilera]]'s "[[Candyman (Christina Aguilera song)|Candyman]]" and received her first standing ovation. For the [[disco]]-themed fourth live show, Burke performed [[Donna Summer]]'s "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]". During [[Mariah Carey]] week on 8 November, Burke and the other finalists met Carey for individual [[masterclass]]es, with Carey complimenting Burke on her voice. Burke performed "[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]" and received a standing ovation from the judges who all gave her positive comments. Cowell commented that "by any standard, that was just outstanding". Following the show Burke's performance was also praised by Carey who called her rendition of the song "absolutely amazing". In weeks 6 and 7, Burke received positive comments from the judging panel for her performances of "You are so Beautiful" and [[Dan Hartman]]'s "[[Relight My Fire]]" (the popularity of which in the UK is mostly a result of [[Take That]]'s 1993 revival thereof). Week 8 saw her replace [[Diana Vickers]] as the bookies' favourite after performing [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" and [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]]' "[[Listen (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Listen]]", for which she received yet another standing ovation. In week 9, Burke performed [[Rihanna]]'s hit song "[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]" and again received positive comments, with Louis calling her "the British Beyonc<U+00E9>" and Simon commenting "...We may be seeing the birth of a star here [...] you've got it all, that was a terrific performance".{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Burke was joined in the grand final by Irish teenager [[Eoghan Quigg]] and boyband [[Jack the Lad Swing|JLS]]. The three finalists were required to sing three songs <U+2013> a Christmas song, a duet with an established music artist, and the song from their favourite performance of the series. Her Christmas song was an adaptaition of "[[Silent Night]]".
