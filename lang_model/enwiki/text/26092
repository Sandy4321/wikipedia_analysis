'''''Edmontosaurus annectens''''' is a [[species]] of flat-headed or [[saurolophinae|saurolophine]] [[hadrosaurid]] [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] (a "duck-billed dinosaur") from the very end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], in what is now [[North America]]. Remains of ''E. annectens'' have been preserved in the [[Frenchman Formation|Frenchman]], [[Hell Creek Formation|Hell Creek]], and [[Lance Formation]]s. All of these formations are dated to the late [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, representing the last three million years before the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene boundary|extinction of the dinosaurs]] (between 66.8 to 65&nbsp;[[million years ago]]<ref name="Holtz2008">Holtz, Thomas R.

''Edmontosaurus annectens'' is known from numerous specimens, including at least twenty partial to complete skulls, discovered in the [[U.S.]] states of [[Montana]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]], and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Saskatchewan]].  It was a large animal, up to approximately {{convert|12|m|ft}} in length, with an extremely long and low [[skull]]. ''E. annectens'' exhibits one of the most striking examples of the "duckbill" snout common to hadrosaurs.  It has a long taxonomic history that includes the genera ''[[Anatosaurus]]'', ''Anatotitan'', ''[[Claosaurus]]'', ''[[Diclonius]]'', ''[[Thespesius]]'', and ''[[Trachodon]]''.

The skull of ''E. annectens'' is known for its long, wide muzzle.  Cope compared this feature to that of a [[goose]] in side view, and to a [[Platalea|short-billed spoonbill]] in top view.<ref name=EDC83/> The skull was longer and lower proportionally than in any other known hadrosaurid.

The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the [[quadrate bone]] that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length.

==Classification==
''E. annectens'' was a [[saurolophinae|saurolophine]] or "flat-headed" [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaurid]]; this group was historically known as Hadrosaurinae.<ref name=PM2010>{{cite journal |last=Prieto-M<U+00E1>rquez |first=Alberto |year=2010 |title=Global phylogeny of Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) using parsimony and Bayesian methods |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=435<U+2013>502 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00617.x}}</ref> Species now considered to be synonyms of ''Edmontosaurus annectens'' were long recognized as closely related to both the genus<ref name=LML20>{{cite journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1920 |title=The hadrosaur ''Edmontosaurus'' from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta |journal=Department of Mines, Geological Survey Memoirs |volume=120 |pages=1<U+2013>79}}</ref> and the species.<ref name=JBH02>{{cite journal |last=Hatcher |first=John B. |authorlink=John Bell Hatcher |title=The genus and species of the Trachodontidae (Hadrosauridae, Claosauridae) Marsh |journal=Annals of the Carnegie Museum |volume=1 |pages=377<U+2013>386 }}</ref> However, the skull of the sub-adult type specimen of ''E. annectens'' differs noticeably from fully mature remains, so many researchers had classified the two growth stages as different species or even genera. On the other side of the issue, other authors, from [[John Bell Hatcher]] in 1902,<ref name=JBH02/> to [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]], [[David B. Weishampel]], and [[Catherine Forster]] in 2004,<ref name=HWF04/> and most recently Nicol<U+00E1>s Campione and David Evans,<ref name=NCDE11/> have proposed that the large, flat-headed specimens most recently classified as ''Anatotitan copei'' belong to ''E. annectens''.

''E. annectens'' was also historically classified in an independent genus, ''Anatosaurus'', following the influential 1942 revision of Hadrosauridae by [[R. S. Lull|Richard Swann Lull]] and [[Nelda Wright]], until it was reclassified as a species of ''Edmontosaurus'' by [[Michael K. Brett-Surman]].<ref name=RCMBS90/> With the discovery that ''A. copei'' and ''E. annectens'' likely represent the same species, some paleontologists have proposed using ''Anatosaurus'' as a valid genus name for ''E. annectens''.<ref name="Holtz2008">Holtz, Thomas R.

==Discovery and history==
[[File:Anatotitan C.Knight.jpg|thumb|Outdated life restoration of "trachodonts" by [[Charles R. Knight]], based on specimens now classified as ''E. annectens'']]
''E. annectens'' has a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, with various specimens having been classified in a variety of genera. Its history involves ''Anatosaurus'', ''Anatotitan'', ''[[Claosaurus]]'', ''[[Diclonius]]'', ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'', ''[[Thespesius]]'', and ''[[Trachodon]]'', as well as ''[[Edmontosaurus]]''.<ref name=HWF04/><ref name=BSC07>{{cite book |last=Creisler |first=Benjamin S. |year=2007 |chapter=Deciphering duckbills: a history in nomenclature |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth (ed.) |title=Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=185<U+2013>210 |isbn=0-253-34817-X}}</ref> References predating the 1980s typically use ''Anatosaurus'', ''Claosaurus'', ''Diclonius'', ''Thespesius'', or ''Trachodon'' for ''E. annectens'' fossils, depending on author and date.

===Cope's ''Diclonius mirabilis''===
The history of ''E. annectens'' predates both ''Edmontosaurus'' and ''annectens''. The first good specimen, the former [[holotype]] (specimen on which a taxonomic name is based) of ''Anatosaurus copei'' (''Anatotitan''), was a complete skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill<ref name=DFG97/> for famous American [[paleontologist]] [[Edward Drinker Cope]].  This specimen, found in [[Hell Creek Formation]] rocks,<ref name=NGD95>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=M. A. |coauthors=Gaffney, E. S.; and Dingus, L. |title=Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=156<U+2013>158 |isbn=0-679-43386-4}}</ref> came from northeast of the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis and part of the torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a [[keratin|horny]] sheath with a tooth-like series of interlocking points on the upper and lower jaws.<ref name=HFO09a/> When describing this specimen [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]]&nbsp;5730, Cope assigned it to the species ''[[Diclonius mirabilis]]''.  This species name was created by combining ''[[Diclonius]]'', a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with ''[[Trachodon|Trachodon mirabilis]]'', an older name based on teeth and published by [[Joseph Leidy]]. Cope believed that Leidy had abandoned ''Trachodon'', so he assigned the old species to his genus.<ref name=EDC83/> Leidy had come to recognize that his ''Trachodon'' was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and had made some attempts to revise the genus, but had not made a formal declaration of his intentions.<ref name=BSC07/>

Cope's description promoted hadrosaurids as amphibious, contributing to this long-time image.<ref name=JHO64>{{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.262.8.975 |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |authorlink=John Ostrom |title=A reconsideration of the paleoecology of the hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=262 |pages=975<U+2013>997 |year=1964 |issue=8}}</ref> His reasoning was that the teeth of the lower jaw were weakly connected to the bone and liable to break off if used to consume terrestrial food, and he described the beak as weak as well.<ref name=EDC83/> Unfortunately for Cope, aside from misidentifying several of the skull bones,<ref name=OCM93>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel C. |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1893 |title=The skull and brain of ''Claosaurus'' |journal=American Journal of Science, 3rd series |volume=45 |pages=83<U+2013>86}}</ref> by chance the lower jaws were missing the walls supporting the teeth from the inside; the teeth were actually well-supported.<ref name=JHO64/><ref name=LW42d>Lull and Wright, ''Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America'', pp. 43.</ref> Cope intended to describe the skeleton as well as the skull, but his promised paper never appeared.<ref name=BSC07/> It was purchased for the American Museum of Natural History in 1899, where it acquired its present designation AMNH&nbsp;5730.<ref name=LW42b/>

[[File:Anatotitan species toes 01.jpg|thumb|left|The digits of a specimen from Montana. Photographed at Dinoday 2009.]] 
Several years after Cope's description, his rival [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] published on a sizable lower jaw recovered by John Bell Hatcher in 1889 from [[Lance Formation]] rocks in [[Niobrara County, Wyoming|Niobrara County]], [[Wyoming]].<ref name=LW42c/> Marsh named this partial jaw ''Trachodon longiceps''.<ref name=OCM90>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel C. |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1890 |title=Additional characteristics of the Ceratopsidae, with notice of new Cretaceous dinosaurs |journal=American Journal of Science, 3rd series |volume=39 |pages=418<U+2013>426}}</ref> It is cataloged as [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]&nbsp;616.  As noted by Lull and Wright, this long slender partial jaw shares with Cope's specimen a prominent ridge running on its side. However, it is much larger: Cope's specimen had a [[dentary]], or tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw, that is {{convert|92.0|cm|in}} long, whereas Marsh's dentary is estimated at {{convert|110.0|cm|in}} long.<ref name=LW42c/>

A second mostly complete skeleton (AMNH&nbsp;5886) was found in 1904 in Hell Creek Formation rocks at Crooked Creek in central [[Montana]] by Oscar Hunter, a [[rancher]]. Upon finding the partially exposed specimen, he and a companion argued about whether or not the remains were recent or fossil. Hunter demonstrated that they were brittle and thus stone by kicking the tops off the vertebrae, an act later lamented by the eventual collector [[Barnum Brown]]. Another cowboy, Alfred Sensiba, bought the specimen from Hunter for a [[pistol]], and later sold it to Brown, who excavated it for the American Museum of Natural History in 1906.<ref name=NGD95/> This specimen had a nearly complete [[vertebra]]l column, permitting the restoration of Cope's specimen. In 1907, these two specimens were famously mounted side-by-side in the American Museum of Natural History, under the name ''Trachodon mirabilis''. Cope's specimen is positioned on all fours with its head down, as if feeding, because it has the better skull, while Brown's specimen, with a less perfect skull, is posed bipedally with the head less accessible. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] described the tableau as representing the two animals feeding along a [[marsh]], the standing individual having been startled by the approach of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Impressions of appropriate plant remains and shells based on associated fossils were included on the base of the group, including [[ginkgo]] leaves, ''[[Sequoioideae|Sequoia]]'' cones, and [[Equisetum|horsetail]] rushes.<ref name=HFO09a/>

The species now known as ''Edmontosaurus annectens'' was named in 1892 as ''Claosaurus annectens'' by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].  This species is [[holotype|based on]] [[National Museum of Natural History|USNM]]&nbsp;2414, a partial skull-roof and skeleton, with a second skull and skeleton, [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]&nbsp;2182, designated the [[paratype]]. Both were collected in 1891 by [[John Bell Hatcher]] from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous [[Lance Formation]] of [[Niobrara County, Wyoming|Niobrara County]] (then part of [[Converse County, Wyoming|Converse County]]), [[Wyoming]].<ref name=OCM92a>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1892 |title=Notice of new reptiles from the Laramie Formation |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=43 |pages=449<U+2013>453}}</ref> This species has some historical footnotes attached: it is among the first dinosaurs to receive a skeletal restoration, and is the first hadrosaurid so restored;<ref name=BSC07/><ref name=OCM92b>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=Othniel Charles |authorlink=Othniel Charles Marsh |year=1892 |title=Restorations of ''Claosaurus'' and ''Ceratosaurus'' |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=44 |pages=343<U+2013>349}}</ref> and YPM&nbsp;2182 and UNSM&nbsp;2414 are, respectively, the first and second essentially complete mounted dinosaur skeletons in the United States.<ref name=FAL04/> YPM&nbsp;2182 was put on display in 1901,<ref name=BSC07/> and USNM&nbsp;2414 in 1904.<ref name=FAL04/>

In the first decade of the twentieth century, two additional important specimens of ''C. annectens'' were recovered. The first, the "[[Trachodon mummy]]" (AMNH&nbsp;5060), was discovered in 1908 by [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg]] and his sons in Lance Formation rocks near [[Lusk, Wyoming|Lusk]], Wyoming. Sternberg was working for the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]], but [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] of the American Museum of Natural History was able to purchase the specimen for $2,000.<ref name=NGD95>{{cite book |last=Norell |first=M.

===Canadian discoveries===
[[File:Horseshoe Canyon.jpg|thumb|left|The Horseshoe Canyon Formation near [[Drumheller, Alberta|Drumheller]]. The dark bands are coal seams.]]
''Edmontosaurus'' itself was coined in 1917 by [[Lawrence Lambe]] for two partial skeletons found in the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] (formerly the lower Edmonton Formation) along the [[Red Deer River]] of southern Alberta, Canada.<ref name=LML17>{{cite journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1917 |title=A new genus and species of crestless hadrosaur from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta |journal=The Ottawa Naturalist |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=65<U+2013>73 |url=http://ia360616.us.archive.org/2/items/ottawanaturalist31otta/ottawanaturalist31otta.pdf |format=pdf (entire volume, 18 mb) |accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is older than the rocks in which ''Claosaurus annectens'' was found.<ref name=NCDE11/> Lambe found that his new dinosaur compared best to Cope's ''Diclonius mirabilis''.<ref name=LML17/>

In 1926, [[Charles Mortram Sternberg]] named ''Thespesius saskatchewanensis'' for [[Canadian Museum of Nature|NMC]]&nbsp;8509, a skull and partial skeleton from the [[Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan|Wood Mountain]] plateau of southern [[Saskatchewan]]. He had collected this specimen in 1921, from rocks that were assigned to the Lance Formation,<ref name=CMS26>{{cite book|last=Sternberg |first=Charles M. |authorlink=Charles Mortram Sternberg |year=1926 |title=A new species of ''Thespesius'' from the Lance Formation of Saskatchewan |publisher=Department of Mines, Geological Survey of Canada |series=Bulletin |volume=44 |pages=77<U+2013>84}}</ref> now the [[Frenchman Formation]].<ref name=HWF04/> NMC&nbsp;8509 included an almost complete skull, numerous vertebrae, partial shoulder and hip girdles, and partial hind limbs, representing the first substantial dinosaur specimen recovered from Saskatchewan. Sternberg opted to assign it to ''Thespesius'' because that was the only hadrosaurid genus known from the Lance Formation at the time.<ref name=CMS26/> At the time, ''T. saskatchewanensis'' was unusual because of its small size, estimated at {{convert|7|to|7.3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length.<ref name=LW42a/>

===Early classifications===
Because of the incomplete understanding of hadrosaurids at the time, following Marsh's death in 1897 ''Claosaurus annectens'' was variously classified as a species of ''Claosaurus'', ''Thespesius'' or ''Trachodon''. Opinions varied greatly; textbooks and encyclopedias drew a distinction between the "''[[Iguanodon]]''-like" ''Claosaurus annectens'' and the "duck-billed" ''Hadrosaurus'' (based on Cope's ''Diclonius mirabilis''), while Hatcher explicitly identified ''C. annectens'' as synonymous with the hadrosaurid represented by those same duck-billed skulls,<ref name=BSC07/> the two differentiated only by individual variation or distortion from pressure.<ref name=JBH02>{{cite journal |last=Hatcher |first=John B. |authorlink=John Bell Hatcher |year=1902 |title=The genus and species of the Trachodontidae (Hadrosauridae, Claosauridae) Marsh |journal=Annals of the Carnegie Museum|issue= 14 |volume=1 |pages=377<U+2013>386}}</ref> Hatcher's revision, published in 1902, was sweeping: he considered almost all hadrosaurid genera then known as synonyms of ''Trachodon''.  This included ''[[Cionodon]]'', ''Diclonius'', ''Hadrosaurus'', ''[[Hadrosaurus|Ornithotarsus]]'', ''[[Pteropelyx]]'', and ''Thespesius'', as well as ''[[Claorhynchus]]'' and ''[[Polyonax]]'',<ref name=JBH02/> fragmentary genera now thought to be [[ceratopsia|horned dinosaurs]]. Hatcher's work led to a brief consensus until about 1910, when new material from Canada and Montana showed a greater diversity of hadrosaurids than previously suspected.<ref name=BSC07/> [[Charles W. Gilmore]] in 1915 reassessed hadrosaurids and recommended that ''Thespesius'' be reintroduced for hadrosaurids from the Lance Formation and rock units of equivalent age, and that ''Trachodon'', based on inadequate material, should be restricted to a hadrosaurid from the older [[Judith River Formation]] and its equivalents. In regards to ''Claosaurus annectens'', he recommended that it be considered the same as ''Thespesius occidentalis''.<ref name=CWG15>{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Charles W. |authorlink=Charles W.

===''Anatosaurus'' to the present===
This confusing situation was temporarily resolved in 1942 by [[Richard Swann Lull]] and [[Nelda Wright]]. In their [[monograph]] on hadrosaurian dinosaurs of North America, they opted to settle the questions revolving around the American Museum duckbills, Marsh's ''Claosaurus annectens'', and several other species by creating a new generic name. They created the new genus ''[[Anatosaurus]]'' ("duck lizard", because of its wide, duck-like beak; [[Latin]] ''anas'' = duck + [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''sauros'' = lizard) and made Marsh's species the [[type species]], calling it ''Anatosaurus annectens''.  To this genus, they also assigned Marsh's ''Trachodon longiceps'', a pair of species that had been assigned to ''Thespesius'' under Gilmore's "Lance Formation hadrosaurid" conception (''T. edmontoni'' from Gilmore in 1924 and ''T. saskatchewanensis''), and Cope's ''Diclonius mirabilis''.<ref name=LW42e>Lull and Wright, ''Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America'', pp. 154<U+2013>164.</ref> Lull and Wright decided to remove the American Museum specimens from ''Diclonius'' (or ''Trachodon'') because they found no convincing reason to assign the specimens to either. Because this left the skeletons without a species name, Lull and Wright gave them their own species, ''Anatosaurus copei'', in honor of Cope. Cope's original specimen (AMNH&nbsp;5730) was made the [[holotype]] of the species, with Brown's (AMNH&nbsp;5886) as the [[plesiotype]].<ref name=LW42b/> ''Anatosaurus'' would come to be called the "classic duck-billed dinosaur."<ref name=DFG82>{{cite book |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The New Dinosaur Dictionary |year=1982 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=Secaucus, NJ |isbn=0-8065-0782-9 |page=57 }}</ref>

This state of affairs persisted for several decades, until Michael K. Brett-Surman reexamined the pertinent material for his graduate studies in the 1970s and 1980s. He concluded that the type species of ''Anatosaurus'', ''A. annectens'', was actually a species of ''Edmontosaurus'', and that ''A. copei'' was different enough to warrant its own genus.<ref name=MKBS75>{{cite book |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1975 |title=The appendicular anatomy of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |series=M.A. thesis |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley}}</ref><ref name=MKBS79>{{cite journal |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1979 |title=Phylogeny and paleobiogeography of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=277 |issue=5697 |pages=560<U+2013>562 |doi=10.1038/277560a0}}</ref><ref name=MKBS89>{{cite book |last=Brett-Surman |first=Michael K. |year=1989 |title=A revision of the Hadrosauridae (Reptilia: Ornithischia) and their evolution during the Campanian and Maastrichtian |series=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, D.C. }}</ref> Although theses and [[dissertation]]s are not regarded as official publications by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]], which regulates the naming of organisms, his conclusions were known to other paleontologists, and were adopted by several popular works of the time.<ref name=DFG82b>{{cite book |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The New Dinosaur Dictionary |year=1982 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=Secaucus, NJ |isbn=0-8065-0782-9 |pages=49, 53}}</ref><ref name=DL83>{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |coauthors=and the Diagram Group |title=A Field Guide to Dinosaurs |year=1983 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-83519-3 |pages=156<U+2013>161}}</ref> His replacement name, ''Anatotitan'' ([[Latin]] ''anas'' ("duck") and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''[[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]'', meaning large), was known and published as such in the popular literature by 1990.<ref name=DL90>{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |coauthors=and the Diagram Group |title=The Dinosaur Data Book |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-75896-2 |pages=41}}</ref> Formal publication of the name ''Anatotitan copei'' took place the same year, in an article co-written by Brett-Surman with [[Ralph Chapman]] (although the name is sometimes credited as Brett-Surman ''vide'' Chapman and Brett-Surman because it came out of Brett-Surman's work).<ref name="RCMBS90"/> Of the remaining species of ''Anatosaurus'', ''A. saskatchewanensis'' and ''A. edmontoni'' were assigned to ''Edmontosaurus'' as well,<ref name=WH90>{{cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |authorlink=David B.

The conception of ''Edmontosaurus'' that emerged included three valid species: the type ''E. regalis'', ''E. annectens'' (including ''Anatosaurus edmontoni'', emended to ''edmontonensis''), and ''E. saskatchewanensis''.<ref name=WH90/> The debate about the proper taxonomy of the ''A. copei'' specimens continues to the present: returning to Hatcher's argument of 1902, Jack Horner, [[David B.

In a 2011 study by Nicol<U+00E1>s Campione and David Evans, the authors conducted the first-ever [[morphometric]] analysis of the various specimens assigned to ''Edmontosaurus''. They concluded that only two species are valid: ''E. regalis'', from the late Campanian, and ''E. annectens'', from the late Maastrichtian. Their study provided further evidence that ''Anatotitan copei'' is a synonym of ''E. annectens''; specifically, that the long, low skull of ''A. copei'' is the result of ontogenetic change and represents mature ''E. annectens'' individuals. ''E. saskatechwanensis'' represents young ''E. annectens,'' and ''Anatosaurus edmontoni'' specimens belong to ''E. regalis'', not ''E. annectens''. The reassessment of ''Edmontosaurus'' assigns twenty skulls to ''E. annectens''. Adult skulls can be distinguished from skulls of ''E. regalis'' by the elongate snout and other details of skull anatomy.<ref name=NCDE11/>

==Paleoecology==
True ''E. annectens'' remains are known only from latest [[Maastrichtian]]-age rocks of the [[Hell Creek Formation|Hell Creek]] and [[Lance Formation]]s from South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, USA and the [[Frenchman Formation]] of Saskatchewan, Canada.<ref name=NCDE11/>

The Lancian time interval was the last interval before the [[Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene extinction event]] that eliminated non-[[bird|avian]] dinosaurs. ''Edmontosaurus'' was one of the more common dinosaurs of the interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh of the large dinosaur sample, with most of the rest (five-sixths) made up of the horned dinosaur ''[[Triceratops]]''.<ref name=RTB86b>Bakker, Robert T.

[[File:Hell Creek.jpg|thumb|The Hell Creek Formation is well exposed in the badlands in the vicinity of Fort Peck Reservoir.]]
The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the [[Fort Peck, Montana|Fort Peck]] area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat forested floodplain, with a relatively dry [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[tree]]s, to conifers such as bald cypress, to [[fern]]s and [[ginkgo]]s. The coastline was hundreds of kilometers or miles to the east.  Stream-dwelling turtles and [[arboreal|tree-dwelling]] [[multituberculata|multituberculate]] mammals were diverse, and [[monitor lizard]]s as large as the modern [[Komodo dragon]] hunted on the ground.  ''Triceratops'' was the most abundant large dinosaur, and ''Thescelosaurus'' the most abundant small herbivorous dinosaur. Edmontosaur remains have been collected here from stream channel sands, and include fossils from individuals as young as a meter- or yard-long infant.  The edmontosaur fossils probably represent accumulations from groups on the move.<ref name=DAR89b>Russell, Dale A. (1989).

The Lance Formation, as typified by exposures approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]] in eastern Wyoming, has been interpreted as a [[bayou]] setting similar to the [[Louisiana]] coastal plain.  It was closer to a large delta than the Hell Creek Formation depositional setting to the north and received much more sediment.  Tropical [[Araucariaceae|araucarian]] [[pinophyta|conifers]] and [[arecaceae|palm]] trees dotted the [[hardwood]] forests, differentiating the flora from the northern coastal plain.<ref name=DAR89c>Russell, Dale A. (1989). ''An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America''. pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> The climate was humid and subtropical, with conifers, [[sabal|palmettos]], and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[live oak]], and [[shrub]]s in the forests.<ref name=KD94>{{cite book |last=Derstler |first=Kraig |year=1994 |editor=Nelson, Gerald E.

Small dinosaurs are not known in as great of abundance here as in the Hell Creek rocks, but ''Thescelosaurus'' once again seems to have been relatively common.

The Lance Formation is the setting of two edmontosaur "mummies".<ref name=DAR89c/>

==Paleobiology==
As hadrosaurids, individuals of ''Edmontosaurus annectens'' would have been large [[herbivore]]s, eating [[plant]]s with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to [[mastication|chewing]]. Their [[tooth|teeth]] were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by the broad beak, and held in the jaws by a [[cheek]]-like structure. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4&nbsp;meters (13&nbsp;ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, they could have moved both [[bipedalism|bipedally]] and [[quadruped]]ally.<ref name=HWF04/>

The extensive depressions surrounding its [[nostril|nasal openings]] may hosted nasal diverticula. These postulated [[Diverticulum|diverticula]] would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.<ref name=JAH75>{{cite journal |last=Hopson |first=James A. |year=1975 |title=The evolution of cranial display structures in hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=Paleobiology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21<U+2013>43 }}</ref>

===Growth===
In a 2011 study, Campione and Evans recorded data from all known "edmontosaur" skulls from the Campanian and Maastrichtian and used it to plot a morphometric' graph, comparing variable features of the skull with skull size. Their results showed that within both recognized ''Edmontosaurus'' species, many features previously used to classify additional species or genera were directly correlated with skull size. Campione and Evans interpreted these results as strongly suggesting that the shape of ''Edmontosaurus'' skulls changed dramatically as they grew. This has led to several apparent mistakes in classification in the past. The three previously recognized Maastrichtian edmontosaur species likely represent growth stages of a single species, with ''E. saskatchewanensis'' representing juveniles, ''E. annectens'' subadults, and ''Anatotian copei'' fully mature adults. The skulls became longer and flatter as the animals grew.<ref name=NCDE11/>

==Notes==
{{Ref|taxonomy|*}} Many of the original references deal with specimens or species that were not assigned to ''E. annectens'' until later. This is particularly true with the specimens long known, chronologically, as ''Diclonius mirabilis'', ''Anatosaurus copei'', and ''Anatotitan copei''.
