'''Barceloneta''' is a [[municipality]] in  [[Puerto Rico]] and is located in the north region, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, north of [[Florida, Puerto Rico|Florida]], east of [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]] and west of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manati]]. Barceloneta is spread over 3 wards and Barceloneta Pueblo (The downtown area and the administrative center of the city).

==History==
'''Barceloneta''' was founded by Don Bononcio Llenza Feli<U+00FA> on July 1, 1881. It was one of the last municipalities created by the Spanish government in Puerto Rico. Barceloneta was named in honor of Barceloneta, a neighborhood in [[Barcelona]], Spain where the founder was born.

Both Barceloneta and Florida were originally part of Manati. Because of its location next to the Manati River, and its natural bay in Palmas Altas, Barceloneta was for a while site of an important port activity, not only in the shipment of sugar from the first Sugar Cane Mill (La Catalana, or "the ''Catalonian''", but also as a passenger route to New York and Barcelona. Don Bonocio's son was the owner of a sail ship that made those routes.

Barceloneta is also known as the Industrial City, the Pineapple City, The Indian City or/and [[Sixto Escobar]]'s City

===Flag===
The flag is a rectangular adaptation of the former Coat of Arms, as are its colors, with the variation of omitting the flowers of "guajana" (sugar cane flower) and that the blazon's gold and silver are substituted by yellow and white, respectively.

===Coat of Arms===
The sugar cane flowers (guajanas) symbolize the source of life of the old agricultural economy of Barceloneta. The blue symbolizes the beaches and marine ports of great importance for industry and commerce. Its crown consists of three towers.
