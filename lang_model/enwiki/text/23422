The '''Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team''' is the [[college basketball|intercollegiate men's basketball]] program representing the [[University of Michigan]]. The school competes in the [[Big Ten Conference]] in [[Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). The [[Michigan Wolverines|Wolverines]] play home basketball games at the [[Crisler Arena]] in {{city-state|Ann Arbor|Michigan}} on the university campus. Michigan has won an NCAA Championship&mdash;under coach [[Steve Fisher]]&mdash;as well as two [[National Invitation Tournament]]s (NIT) and 12 [[Big Ten Conference]] championships. In addition, it has won an NIT tournament and a Big Ten Conference Tournament that were forfeited due to NCAA sanctions.<ref name=MB07-8p5>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=5|date=2007}}</ref> The team is currently coached by [[John Beilein]].

Michigan endured the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]], that the NCAA described as one of the biggest financial scandal in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned [[Chris Webber]], [[Robert Traylor]], [[Louis Bullock]], and [[Maurice Taylor]] a total of [[U.S. Dollar|$]]616,000.<ref name=AfFtrNtcMc>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/basketball/ncaa/03/17/amaker.fired/index.html|title=Amaker fired: Failure to reach NCAA tourney costs Michigan coach|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2007-03-17|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[SI.com]]}}</ref> Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 [[Final Four]], the 1992&ndash;93, 1995&ndash;96, 1996&ndash;97, 1997&ndash;98, and 1998&ndash;99 seasons have been vacated.

==History==
;Early years (1908&ndash;19)
As a result of public and alumni demand for a basketball team, Michigan fielded a team of members of the then-current student body and achieved a 1&ndash;4 record for the 1908&ndash;09 season. However, after three years of demanding a basketball program the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance.<ref name=MB07-8p190>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=190|date=2007}}</ref> Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of [[Varsity team|varsity]] basketball. The team was coached by [[Elmer Mitchell]] who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6&ndash;12 overall (0&ndash;10, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16&ndash;8 (5&ndash;5) record.<ref name=MB07-8p190/>

;Mather era (1919&ndash;28)
[[Edward Mather]] coached the team to three Big Nine titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10&ndash;13 overall (3&ndash;9, Big Ten) record during the 1919&ndash;20, he led the team to an 18&ndash;4 overall (8&ndash;4, Big Ten) record during the 1920&ndash;21 season.<ref name=MB07-8p190/> This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin Badgers]] and [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue Boilermakers]] for the Big Nine title.<ref name=MB07-8p10/> The team won back-to-back championships in 1925&ndash;26 and 1926&ndash;27.<ref name=MB07-8p190/> The 1926 squad, which was [[captain (sports)|captained]] by [[Richard Doyle (basketball)|Richard Doyle]] who became the team's first [[All-American]], tied with Purdue, the [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Iowa Hawkeyes]] and [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]] for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, [[Bennie Oosterbaan]], and won the schools first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14&ndash;3 overall (10&ndash;2, Big Ten) record.<ref name=MB07-8p10/><ref name=MB07-8p190/> Mather suddenly died in 1928.<ref name=MB07-8p190/>

;Veenker era (1928&ndash;31)
[[George Veenker]] compiled the highest overall and highest Big Ten winning percentages of any coach in school history during his three years as coach. He earned 1st(tied), 3rd and 2nd(tied) finishes during his three seasons, which included the 1928&ndash;29 conference championship. During Veenker's first season his team compiled a 13&ndash;3 overall (10&ndash;2, Big Ten) record to win the conference, and Veenker continues to be the only coach in school history to win a conference championship in his first season.<ref name=MB07-8p10/><ref name=MB07-8p191>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=191|date=2007}}</ref> The championship team, which finished tied with Wisconsin, was captained by the schools third All-American [[Ernie McCoy (athletic director)|Ernie McCoy]].<ref name=MB07-8p10/> Veenker resigned to become the [[Iowa State Cyclones football]] head coach.<ref name=MB07-8p191/>

;Cappon era (1931&ndash;38)
[[Franklin Cappon]] had a long history of association with Michigan athletics starting with his service as a four-time [[varsity letter|letterman]] in football and basketball from 1919 to 1923. In 1928, he became assistant football and basketball coach and in 1929 he served as [[Fielding Yost]]'s assistant Athletic Director.<ref name=MB07-8p192/> Although the highlight of Cappon's tenure as coach was a 16&ndash;4 (9&ndash;3) third place 1936&ndash;37 Big Ten finish, he coached [[John Townsend (basketball)|John Townsend]] who in his 1937&ndash;38 senior season became the last All-American for over a generation (until the arrival of [[Cazzie Russell]]).<ref name=MB07-8p192-3>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=192-3|date=2007}}</ref><ref name=MB07-8p13/> The team finished third in two other seasons with less impressive records (1932&ndash;33 10&ndash;8 overall (8&ndash;4, Big Ten) and 1935&ndash;36 15&ndash;5 overall (7&ndash;5, Big Ten)),<ref name=MB07-8p193>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=193|date=2007}}</ref> and Cappon's overall record was 78&ndash;57 overall (44&ndash;40, Big Ten).<ref name=MB07-8p192/> A notable captain during the Cappon era was 1933&ndash;34 captain [[Ted Petoskey]], a two-time [[American football|football]] All-American [[End (football)|end]] and eventual [[Major League Baseball]] player.<ref name=MB07-8p154>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=154|date=2007}}</ref>

;Oosterbaan era (1938&ndash;46)
In 1938 Michigan coaching duties were assumed by one of its greatest athletes. [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] had been an All-American in both football and basketball and held various coaching positions at Michigan in both of those sports as well as [[baseball]]. In basketball, he implemented a fast-paced attack as coach, and his teams' best overall record was 13&ndash;7 in 1939&ndash;40. That season he tied with his final season for his best Big Ten record at 6&ndash;6. He resigned after eight seasons to concentrate on his football coaching duties.<ref name=MB07-8p192>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=192|date=2007}}</ref>

;Cowles era (1946&ndash;48)

;McCoy era (1948&ndash;52)
[[Ernie McCoy (athletic director)|Ernie McCoy]] became the second former All-American Wolverine player to coach the team.<ref name=MB07-8p145/> Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a football and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under [[Fritz Crisler]]. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948&ndash;49 season when they finished 15&ndash;6 overall (7&ndash;5, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in [[Pete Elliot]] and captain [[Bob Harrison]] who were both selected to the first team.<ref name=MB07-8p194/> Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree.<ref name=MB07-8p147>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=147|date=2007}}</ref> McCoy served as a football [[Scout (sport)|scout]] at the same time.<ref name=MB07-8p194>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=194|date=2007}}</ref>

;Perigo era (1952&ndash;60)
[[Bill Perigo]] took over the Michigan coaching job after having served three seasons as [[Western Michigan Broncos men's basketball|Western Michigan]] basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre season.<ref name=MB07-8p194/> His best Big Ten records came in 1956&ndash;57 and 1958&ndash;59 when his teams compiled 8&ndash;6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15&ndash;7 overall (8&ndash;6, Big Ten).<ref name=MB07-8p195>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=195|date=2007}}</ref> It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in [[M. C. Burton]].<ref name=MB07-8p147/> Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American [[Ron Kramer]] was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.<ref name=MB07-8p147>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=147|date=2007}}</ref>

;Strack era (1960&ndash;68)
[[Dave Strack]], a former team 1945&ndash;46 captain, had become the freshman basketball team coach in 1948 and later had become a variety assistant to Perigo.<ref name=MB07-8p195-6/> He led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1963&ndash;66 and a third place finish in the 1964 NCAA tournament. During 1964&ndash;65 the team compiled a 24&ndash;4 overall (13&ndash;1, Big Ten) record while completing an undefeated 11&ndash;0 overall (7&ndash;0, Big Ten) home season. Strack earned [[United Press International]] (UPI) National [[Coach of the Year]] honors. The team ended the season listed number one in both the UPI and [[Associated Press]] (AP) national rankings.

In 1965, Buntin became the first Wolverine to be drafted by the NBA. In 1966, Russell led the team to its third straight conference championship and NCAA selection on his way to National [[Player of the Year]] honors.<ref name=MB07-8p11>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=11|date=2007}}</ref>

;Orr era (1968&ndash;80)
In [[Johnny Orr]]'s twelve seasons, he twice (1973&ndash;74 and 1976&ndash;77) earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors with Big Ten Champions. His teams earned four consecutive NCAA selections from 1974&ndash;77. The 25&ndash;7 overall (14&ndash;4, Big Ten) 1976 team lost to an undefeated Indiana team in the NCAA championship game, and Orr earned [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] Coach of the Year honors that season.

;Frieder era (1980&ndash;89)
[[Bill Frieder]], who had been an assistant coach for seven years, took over from Orr in 1980. He coached the school's first post-season basketball champions during the 1983&ndash;84 season and the following two teams were back-to-back conference champions. The 1983&ndash;84 team compiled a 24&ndash;9 overall (11&ndash;7, Big Ten) record on their way to a NIT championship victory over [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].

;Fisher era (1989&ndash;97)
[[Steve Fisher]] assumed the coaching position immediately before the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament from Frieder after having served and led the team to six straight victories and the championship. Fisher also signed the most famous recruiting class known as the [[Fab Five]] (Webber, [[Juwan Howard]], [[Jalen Rose]], [[Jimmy King]] and [[Ray Jackson]]).

;Ellerbe era (1997&ndash;2001)
[[Brian Ellerbe]] assumed the title of interim coach less than five months after becoming an assistant coach.

===Fab Five===
The Fab Five, the 1992 recruiting class of five freshman starters, were Chris Webber*, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having gone to the championship game of the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy [[gym shorts]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/2002-03-27-cover-fab5.htm|title=Fab Five anniversary falls short of fondness|accessdate=2008-08-10|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2002-03-28|author=Wieberg, Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/11/17/Columns/Fab_Five_glory_has_tu.shtml|title=Fab Five glory has turned into gloomy story at Michigan|accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2002-11-17|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|author=Mizell, Hubert}}</ref> which was later popularized by [[Michael Jordan]],<ref name=FFLHiaHL>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/sports/ncaabasketball/11fab.html?|title=Fab Five Legacy Hides in a Historical Library |accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2007-02-11|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> and for wearing black [[athletic socks]].<ref name=FFLHiaHL/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/reflecting-on-the-fab-five/?|title=Reflecting on the Fab Five|accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2008-03-27|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Ennis, Connor}}</ref> Due to the [[University of Michigan - Ed Martin scandal]], the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited.<ref name=FFLHiaHL/> Although Webber was the only member of the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE3DC1731F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63|title=Sports of The Times; Forgetting The Fab Five Is Impossible |accessdate=2008-08-10|date=2002-11-08|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Rhoden, William C.}}</ref> Webber (1993*), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans.<ref name=MB07-8p13-21/><ref name=MB07-8p145/> and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors.<ref name=MB07-8p147/> All but Jackson played in the NBA.<ref name=MB07-8p24-5>{{cite book|title=2007-08 Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=University of Michigan|page=24-5|date=2007}}</ref> They were the subject of [[Mitch Albom]]'s book entitled ''Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Fab-Five/Mitch-Albom/p/9780446601191|title=Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream|accessdate=2008-08-10|publisher=Barnesandnoble.com llc}}</ref> which at one point was under development by [[Fox Television]] as a made-for-television movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsontheweb.com/features/authormonth/0309albom/albom-mitch.asp|title=Author of the Month: Mitch Albom|accessdate=2008-08-10|date=September 2003|publisher=AuthorsOnTheWeb.com}}</ref>

===Ed Martin scandal===
{{mainarticle|University of Michigan basketball scandal}}
During the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Internal Revenue Service]], and [[United States Department of Justice]] investigated the relationship between the [[University of Michigan]], its men's basketball teams and [[Booster (sports)|basketball team booster]] Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to [[money laundering|launder money]] from an illegal [[gambling]] operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history.<ref name=SwkAfrM>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/columns/weeklyword/index/1425084.html|title=Scandal won't keep Amaker from rebuilding Michigan|accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2003-08-30|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Katz, Andy}}</ref> It was described as one of the three or first violations of NCAA [[bylaw]]s in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by [[ESPN]].<ref name=SwkAfrM/><ref name=CNBMFNP/>

The case began when the investigation of an automobile rollover accident during [[Mateen Cleaves]]' 1996 [[Michigan Wolverines]] recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players ([[Chris Webber]], [[Maurice Taylor]], [[Robert Traylor]] and [[Louis Bullock]]) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin.<ref name=SwkAfrM/> During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his [[perjury]] during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by [[National Basketball Association]] after performing public service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E0DB123DF93BA25751C0A9629C8B63|title=ROUNDUP: N.B.A.; Anthony Leads Nuggets To Victory Over 76ers |accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2004-02-18|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E5DA1731F932A3575AC0A9639C8B63|title=SPORTS BRIEFING: BASKETBALL - Finley Picks Spurs |accessdate=2008-08-09|date=2005-09-01|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

In 2002, the University punished itself when it became apparent that its players were guilty by declaring itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two year probation.<ref name=BMPBP>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4DD1731F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63|title=BASKETBALL; Michigan Punishes Basketball Program |accessdate=2008-08-08|date=2002-11-08|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Hakim, Danny}}</ref> The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012.<ref name=NpUb>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/basketball/index.ssf?/stories/wolverines/20030508ncaa_punishment.html|title=NCAA punishes U-M basketball: Case called 'one of the most serious ever,' which cheapens college athletics|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2003-05-08|publisher=MLive.com|work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|author=Heuser, John}}</ref><ref name=CNBMFNP>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4D6173FF93AA35756C0A9659C8B63|title=COLLEGES; N.C.A.A.

The punishment cost the 17&ndash;13 2002&ndash;03 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the [[1997 National Invitation Tournament]] and the 1998 [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] championships as well as [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] Final Four recognition. It cost Chris Webber his All-American 1993 honors, Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. [[Steve Fisher]] lost his job as Michigan [[head coach]] as a result of the scandal.<ref name=MB07-8p8/>
