'''Hurricane Erika''' was a weak [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|hurricane]] that struck extreme northeastern [[Mexico]] near the [[Texas]]-[[Tamaulipas]] border in mid-August of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Erika was the eighth [[tropical cyclone]], fifth [[tropical storm]], and third [[hurricane]] of the season. At first, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. It was not until later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category&nbsp;1 intensity in the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The storm developed from a non-tropical [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 14. Under the influence of a [[high pressure area|high pressure system]], Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under [[tropical cyclogenesis|favorable conditions]]. It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland.

While Erika's precursor disturbance was moving across [[Florida]], it dropped heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60&nbsp;mph (80 to 95&nbsp;km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind damage in the state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Erika 2003 track.png}}
A weak surface area of low pressure detached from a [[Surface weather analysis|frontal system]] on August 8 while 1,150&nbsp;miles (1,850&nbsp;km) to the east of [[Bermuda]]. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated [[convection]] as it passed beneath a cold-core [[Troposphere|upper-level]] [[low pressure area|low]]. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] while 440&nbsp;miles (700&nbsp;km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained near the center of the upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern [[Bahamas]], a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the [[troposphere]], coinciding with the development of an upper level [[anticyclone]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Franklin|year=2003|title=Hurricane Erika Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-09-24|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003erika.shtml}}</ref>

A closed low-level circulation nearly developed on August 14 to the east of [[Key Largo, Florida]], but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida.<ref name="tcr"/> After crossing Florida, [[Hurricane Hunters]] indicated a poorly defined circulation, but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength, and the system was designated as Tropical Storm ''Erika'' late on August 14 while located 85&nbsp;miles (135&nbsp;km) west of [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]].<ref name="erika1">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Erika Discussion One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-09-24|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al082003.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

With well-established [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and low levels of [[wind shear]],<ref name="erika1"/> Erika strengthened as the circulation became better defined. A high pressure system persisted over the south-central [[United States]], forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h). On August 15, convection organized into [[rainband|bands]], and as its winds approached hurricane strength, an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed within the storm. Erika turned to the west-southwest on August 16, and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near [[Boca San Rafael]], Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico, or about 40&nbsp;miles (70&nbsp;km) south of the [[United States<U+2013>Mexico border]]. The storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], and Erika dissipated early on August 17.<ref name="tcr"/> The mid-level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed Mexico, and led to the formation of a tropical disturbance after entering the [[Gulf of California]] on August 18. It turned to the northwest and weakened on August 20.<ref name="hpc">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2007|title=Rainfall Data for Hurricane Erika|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-01-04|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/erika2003filledrainblk.gif}}</ref>

Operationally Erika was never upgraded to hurricane status. Based on a persistent eye feature on radar and [[Doppler weather radar]]-estimated surface winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), the [[National Hurricane Center]] posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane.<ref name="tcr"/>

The threat of Erika's onslaught prompted the evacuation of 51&nbsp;[[oil platform]]s and 3&nbsp;[[Oil platform|oil rig]]s in the western Gulf of Mexico. The lack of production led to a loss of production of {{convert|8708|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day and {{convert|173.14|e6cuft|m3}} of [[natural gas]] per day. On the day of its landfall, the lack of production led to 1,979 less barrels of oil for the day, or about 0.12% of the total daily production for the Gulf of Mexico, while the loss of {{convert|32|Mcuft|m3}} of gas for the day was equivalent to 0.23% of the total production.<ref name="oil">{{cite web|author=U.S. Department of the Interior|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Erika Evacuation and Production Statistics|accessdate=2006-09-24|url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/030818s.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060829234102/http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/030818s.html| archivedate = August 29, 2006}}</ref> However, due to its rapid motion, the passage of the storm resulted in minimal effects on operations.<ref name="planetark">{{cite web|author=Deborah Tedford|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Erika Lashes Northern Mexico|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2006-10-15|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/21872/story.htm}}</ref>

While the storm was located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Watch|Hurricane Watch]] and [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|Tropical Storm Warning]] from [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] to [[Baffin Bay, Texas]]. The center also recommended a Hurricane Watch spanning from [[Soto la Marina]], Tamaulipas to the international border. Late that same day, when strengthening was underway, a Hurricane Warning was either issued or recommended from [[La Pesca]], Mexico to Baffin Bay, Texas, though the warnings for south Texas were dropped when a more southward motion occurred.<ref name="tcr"/> Just one month after [[Hurricane Claudette (2003)|Hurricane Claudette]] caused millions in damage in south Texas, the fast movement of Erika caught citizens by surprise as it was forecast to make landfall near Brownsville.
