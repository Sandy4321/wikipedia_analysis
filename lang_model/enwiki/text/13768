'''David Lovering''' (born [[December 6]] [[1961]]) is an [[United States|American]] musician and magician. He is best known as the drummer for the [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies]], which he joined in 1985. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with other acts, including former Pixies bandmate [[Joey Santiago]]'s band [[The Martinis]], [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]], [[Nitzer Ebb]] and [[Tanya Donelly]]. He also pursued a career as '''The Scientific Phenomenalist''', performing science-based experiments on stage and occasionally opening for former bandmates [[Frank Black]] and [[Kim Deal]]'s band [[The Breeders]]. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.

Inspired by bands from a variety of genres, such as [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Steely Dan]], Lovering's drumming technique, as part of the Pixies, was acclaimed by critics. Author Ben Sisario named him the "great unacknowledged anchor" of the band,<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 59</ref> and said that his unique influences gave him "a precision and versatility essential to following [[Frank Black|[Black] Francis]]' songwriting quirks".<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 15</ref> However, after the band's breakup, Lovering received fewer critical accolades for his musical output.

==Biography==
===Youth and college===
David Lovering was born in {{city-state|Boston|Massachusetts}} on [[December 6]] [[1961]]. Lovering had a mostly conventional childhood, although at the age of six he rode a unicycle through a Mormon church service for a bet. He learned to play drums during his teenage years, and joined the [[high school]] marching band.<ref name="pixieshist">Mico, Ted. "Hispanic in the Streets". ''Melody Maker''. September 1990.</ref> His favorite band during school was [[Rush (band)|Rush]]; according to his friend John Murphy, Lovering was "drum orientated as far as bands would go".<ref name="fg18">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 18</ref> In his high school yearbook entry, Lovering stated his three main ambitions: to be in a rock band, to be an electrical engineer and to tour with Rush.<ref name="misfits">{{cite web | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1552638,00.html | title=Misfits that fit | accessdate=2007-03-17 | author=Barton, Laura | publisher=The Guardian | date=2005-07-20}}</ref>

After leaving school, Lovering studied [[electronic engineering]] at the [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]] in Boston, and got a job working at a [[Radio Shack]] store with Murphy.<ref name="fg18" /> The pair often played practical jokes while on the job; one incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm.<ref name="lamagic">{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/rock-magicians/2578/ | title=Rock Magicians | accessdate=2007-09-15 | author=Albert, John | publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]'' | date=[[2003-07-13]]}}</ref> After graduating from Wentworth with a bachelor's degree, he took a job building [[laser]]s and continued to drum, playing in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff.<ref name="pixieshist" /> He cited bands from a number of genres, including [[jazz rock]] band [[Steely Dan]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] group [[Devo]] as influences on his style.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nofimagazine.com/e-m-int2.htm | title=Interview with Eeenie Meenie Part Two | accessdate=2007-11-24 | publisher=No-Fi Magazine}}</ref>

===Pixies===
{{main|Pixies}}
Lovering attended Murphy's [[wedding reception]] on [[Memorial Day]] 1984, where he met Murphy's wife, [[Kim Deal]]. Deal then joined the Pixies, an [[alternative rock]] band formed by [[Black Francis]] and [[Joey Santiago]], in January 1985 as bassist; Murphy suggested Lovering as a possible drummer for the band, so the Pixies invited Lovering back to their place. He had stopped drumming by this point and was initially not keen on their material, but after playing along to several of the band's songs, agreed to join the Pixies.<ref name="fg18" /> Lovering and the band began rehearsing throughout 1985 and 1986, and performed around Boston in late 1986 and 1987. The Pixies decided to record eighteen songs for [[The Purple Tape|a demo tape]] in 1987; Lovering co-wrote "Levitate Me" with frontman Black Francis and Francis' girlfriend, and appeared on the tape's front cover jogging naked with his back turned to the camera.<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 55</ref> The song later appeared on the band's first release, ''[[Come on Pilgrim]]'', along with seven other songs from the demo tape.

The Pixies entered the studio again to record 1988's ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. Lovering's drumming on songs such as "Bone Machine", which begins with a ten second drum solo, "Break My Body" and "River Euphrates" established his steady and accurate style. ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'', the band's major label debut, followed in 1989. During the album's recording sessions, Francis asked Lovering to sing on "La La Love You", a "dig at the very idea of a love song".<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 104</ref> After drinking several beers, Lovering agreed to do it; producer [[Gil Norton]] later commented on Lovering's vocals: "He went from not wanting to sing a note to I can't get him away from the microphone. He was such a showman".<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 113</ref> Lovering also played bass guitar on the album's penultimate track, "Silver".

After ''Doolittle'', the relationship between the band members became strained; the Pixies were constantly touring and had released three albums in two years. After the final date of the ''Doolittle'' "Fuck or Fight" tour, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus. During this time, Lovering traveled to Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/?page=3 | title=4AD <U+2014> Pixies Profile (page 3) | accessdate=2006-08-31 | publisher=4AD}}</ref> After the band reconvened in 1990, Lovering moved to [[Los Angeles]] and contributed to their later releases, 1990's ''[[Bossanova]]'' and 1991's ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''. He also sang lead vocals on the "[[Velouria]]" B-side "Make Believe", a song about his "obsession" with American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Debbie Gibson]].<ref>{{cite album-notes | title=Complete 'B' Sides | albumlink=Complete 'B' Sides | bandname=[[Pixies]] | year=2001 | last=Black | first=Frank | format=CD booklet | publisher=[[4AD]]}}</ref> The Pixies toured sporadically throughout 1991 and 1992. They eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Francis and Deal, although the breakup was not publicly announced until 1993.<ref>"Pixies' Bossa Says It's Nova". ''NME''. January 1993</ref>

===The Scientific Phenomenalist and other projects===
Following the Pixies' breakup, Lovering drummed with several artists, including with [[Nitzer Ebb]] in live performances, as well as studio work and auditioning for bands; he turned down an invitation to play with the [[Foo Fighters]] as they were forming.<ref name="fg183">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 183</ref> Lovering first joined [[The Martinis]], appearing on their song, "Free" (which appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Empire Records]]''), but left to become a touring drummer with [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wm04.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:jcfpxqwaldae~T1 | title=The Martinis > Biography | accessdate=2007-11-21 | author=Phares, Heather | publisher=[[All Music Guide]]}}</ref> Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with [[Tanya Donelly]]'s band on ''[[Lovesongs for Underdogs]]'' (1997) and Boston band Eeenie Meenie, unti opportunities for new work dried up. Eentually Lovering gave up the drums, and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.<ref name="fg183" />

Towards the end of 1990s, Lovering's friend [[Grant-Lee Phillips]] took him to a magic convention; Lovering was impressed by some of the tricks, later stating: "I had to learn how to do it". Carl Grasso, a friend of the pair, invited them to the [[Magic Castle]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="lamagic" /> He met [[Possum Dixon]] frontman [[Rob Zabrecky]], and the pair soon became friends; Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for membership of the Magic Castle.<ref name="lamagic2">{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/rock-magicians/2578/?page=2 | title=Rock Magicians - Page 2 | accessdate=2007-12-01 | author=Albert, John | publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]'' | date=[[2003-07-13]]}}</ref> After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as "The Scientific Phenomanalist", combining his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience, as he felt he "couldn't top the Pixies".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1992289,00.html | title=Spiritual (and other) rebirths | accessdate=2007-12-17 | author=Bainbridge, Luke | publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' | date=2007-01-21}}</ref>

Lovering became part of [[The Unholy Three]], a trio of magicians that resided at the Magic Castle.<ref name="lamagic2" /> He brought his act across the United States as the opener for Frank Black (the new stage name of former Pixies bandmate Black Francis),<ref name="fg184">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 184</ref> [[Grant-Lee Phillips]], [[The Breeders]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]. He also performed his act at the [[Shellac]]-curated [[All Tommorow's Parties]] music festival in 2002, later naming it "perhaps my greatest achievement".<ref name="lamagic" /> Lovering resumed drumming, appearing at some [[Frank Black and the Catholics]] shows. He also appeared on one track of [[The Martinis]]'s ''[[The Smitten Sessions]]'' (2004).

===Pixies reunion===
By the summer of 2003, Lovering "was bottoming out". In an 2004 interview, he commented: "I remember I was on the way to the bank, and I was just bummed out - everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm on the way to the bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe [Santiago]; he says, 'Guess what?'". Santiago had just received a call from Frank Black stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering "just jumped through the ceiling" at the news. He added "The saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved".<ref name="misfits" /> Lovering appeared on the band's 2004 reunion single, "[[Bam Thwok]]".

Lovering appeared in ''loudQUIETloud'' (2006), a film about the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father became increasingly frail and died during the tour; Lovering began drinking heavily as a result, and, according to Black, "messed up a couple of songs" during live shows. Black later commented on the incident: "It was all caught on film. But they re-edited this to look like it happened in the middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careered into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/24809 | title=Pixies to begin work on new albm | accessdate=2007-11-23 | publisher=''[[NME]]'' | date=2006-10-24}}</ref> He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for [[Wally Ingram]] as part of the Martinis,<ref name="nmemart">{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/garbage/26191 | title=Pixies men, Garbage, George Clinton play benefit show | accessdate=2007-10-07 | publisher=''[[NME]]'' | date=[[2007-02-01]]}}</ref> and formed a new band, The Hermetic Order Of The Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lsd&task=default&id=139797&tab=calendar&Itemid=571 | title=LA Weekly - Calendar Listings | accessdate=2007-12-03 | publisher=LaWeekly.com}}</ref>

==Magic performance==
Lovering dubs himself a "scientific phenomentalist", performing science and physics experiments in a lab coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and likes "things that are more mental, using mental powers". He later explained: "It's all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [the audience] going 'Is it [magic] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. So I do kinda weird things that other magicians don't do".<ref name="fg184" /> Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist [[Ricky Jay]], mind reader [[Max Maven]] and [[Eugene Burger]] as influences on his technique.<ref name="lamagic2" /> His performances often involve intricate self-built machines; one trick involves a device called a "Electronic Flux Amplifier".<ref name="lamagic3">{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/rock-magicians/2578/?page=3 | title=Rock Magicians - Page 3 | accessdate=2007-12-01 | author=Albert, John | publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]'' | date=[[2003-07-13]]}}</ref>

Lovering performs "a new-wave, alternative, avant-garde kind of magic" at the Magic Castle with The Unholy Three,<ref name="lamagic2" /> but has yet to appear in the Castle's main theaters. He has played a number of venues, including the California Institute of Abnormal Arts, a number of clubs in Los Angeles and music concerts and festivals. Lovering's bandmate [[Frank Black]] later commented: "I think acts like his are a really good thing because by the time you take the stage as the headliner, everyone still has fresh ears".<ref name="lamagic3" />
