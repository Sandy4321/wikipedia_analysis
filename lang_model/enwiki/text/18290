'''Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz''', as he is known in Europe (October 22, 1783 <U+2013> September 18, 1840), was a nineteenth-century [[polymath]] who made notable contributions to [[botany]], [[zoology]], the study of [[Mound builder (people)|prehistoric earthworks in North America]] and ancient [[Mesoamerican languages|Mesoamerican linguistics]].

Rafinesque was [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], and is often portrayed as an "erratic genius".<ref>{{harvnb|Flannery|1998}}</ref> He was an [[autodidact]] who excelled in various fields of knowledge, as a [[zoologist]], [[botanist]], [[writer]] and [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]]. He wrote prolifically on such diverse topics as [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[linguistics]], but was honored in none of these fields during his lifetime. Today, scholars agree that he was far ahead of his time in many areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|2005}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|1999}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Rafinesque was born on October 22, 1783<ref name="Belyi">{{harnvb|Belyi|1997}}</ref> in [[Galata]], a suburb of [[Constantinople]].<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p11">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=11}}</ref><ref name="appletons"/> His father F. G. Rafinesque was a [[French people|French]] merchant from [[Marseilles]]; his mother M. Schmaltz was of [[Germans|German]] descent and born in Constantinople.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p11"/> His father died in [[Philadelphia]] about 1793.<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=12}}</ref> Rafinesque spent his youth in Marseilles,<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p11"/> and was mostly self-educated, he never attended University.<ref>[http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=518 Discovering Lewis & Clark: biography of Rafinesque]; accessed : 17 November 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/4/1985_4_58.shtml American Heritage : The oddest of characters]; accessed 17 November 2010.</ref> By the age of twelve, he had begun collecting plants for a [[herbarium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=13}}</ref> By fourteen, he taught himself perfect Greek and Latin because he needed to follow footnotes in the books he was reading in his grandmothers' libraries. In 1802, at the age of nineteen, Rafinesque came to Philadelphia with his younger brother, and traveled through [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware]],<ref name="appletons">{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Rafinesque, Constantine Samuel|year=1900}}</ref> where he made the acquaintance of most of the young nation's few botanists.<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|pp=15<U+2013>17}}</ref> In 1805 he returned to Europe with his collection of botanical specimens, and settled in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]].<ref name="appletons"/><ref name="Fitzpatrick_p19">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=19}}</ref> He became so successful in trade that he could retire by age twenty-five and devote his time entirely to natural history. For a time Rafinesque also worked as secretary to the American [[consul]].<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p19"/> During his stay in Sicily he studied plants and fishes,<ref name="Belyi"/> naming many species of each.

===Career in the United States===
In 1815, after his son died, Rafinesque left his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] and returned to the United States. When his ship ''Union'' foundered near the coast of Connecticut, he lost all his books (50 boxes) and all his specimens (including more than 60,000 [[mollusc shell|shells]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Rafinesque |first=C. S. |year=1836 |title=Life of Travels |pages=46<U+2013>49}} Cited in {{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|pp=21<U+2013>22}}.</ref> Settling in [[New York]], Rafinesque became a founding member of the newly established "Lyceum of Natural History."<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|pp=22<U+2013>24}}</ref> In 1817 his book ''Florula Ludoviciana'' was strongly criticized by fellow botanists, which caused his writings to be ignored. By 1818, he had collected and named more than 250 new species of plants and animals. Slowly he was rebuilding his collection of objects from nature.

In 1819 Rafinesque became professor of [[botany]] at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where he also gave private lessons in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|pp=27<U+2013>28}}</ref> He started recording all the new species of plants and animals he encountered in travels throughout the state. He was considered an erratic student of higher plants. In the spring of 1826, he left the university<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=34}}</ref> after quarreling with its president.

Rafinesque traveled and lectured in various places, and endeavored to establish a magazine and a botanic garden, but without success. He moved to [[Philadelphia]] without employment. He published ''The Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge, a Cyclop<U+00E6>dic Journal and Review'',<ref>{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=38}}</ref> of which only eight numbers appeared (1832<U+2013>1833). He also gave public lectures and continued publishing, mostly at his own expense.

===Death===
Rafinesque died of stomach and liver cancer in [[Philadelphia]] on September 18, 1840.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p42">{{harvnb|Fitzpatrick|1911|p=42}}</ref> It has been speculated that the cancer may have been induced by Rafinesque's [[self-medication]] years before with a mixture containing [[maidenhair fern]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ambrose|2010}}</ref> He was buried in a plot in what is now Ronaldson's Cemetery.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_p42"/> In March 1924 what were thought to be his remains were brought back to Transylvania University and reinterred in a tomb under a stone inscribed, "Honor to whom honor is overdue."<ref>{{harvnb|Boewe|1987}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barefoot|2004|p=78}}</ref>

==Work==

===Biology===
Rafinesque published 6,700 [[binomial name]]s of plants, many of which have [[Principle of Priority|priority]] over more familiar names.<ref>{{harvnb|Boewe|2005|p=1}}</ref> The quantity of new taxa he produced, both plants and animals, has made Rafinesque memorable or even notorious among biologists.<ref>{{harvnb|Boewe|2005|p=2}}</ref> The standard [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|author abbreviation]] '''Raf.''' is used to indicate Rafinesque as the author when [[author citation (botany)|citing]] a [[botanical name]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/authorsearch?id=8096-1&query_type=by_id |title=Rafinesque, Constantine Samuel (1783<U+2013>1840) |work=Author Details |publisher=[[International Plant Names Index]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Mule Deer at Clearwater Pass 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Mule Deer]] is one of many species first named by Rafinesque.]]
Rafinesque applied to join the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], but was twice turned down by [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2004|p=98}}</ref> After studying the specimens collected by the expedition, he assigned scientific names to the [[black-tailed prairie dog]] (''Cynomys ludovicianus''), the [[White-footed Mouse|white-footed mouse]] (''Peromyscus leucopus'') and the [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'').

===''Walam Olum''===
In 1836 Rafinesque published his first volume of ''The American Nations''. This included ''[[Walam Olum]]'', a purported migration and creation narrative of the [[Lenape]] ("Delaware Indians"). It told of their migration to the lands around the [[Delaware River]]. Rafinesque claimed he had obtained wooden tablets engraved and painted with indigenous [[pictographs]], together with a transcription in the [[Lenape language]], from which he produced an English translation of the tablets' contents. Rafinesque claimed the original tablets and transcription were later lost, leaving his notes and transcribed copy as the only record of evidence.

For over a century after Rafinesque's publication, the ''Walam Olum'' was widely accepted by ethnohistorians as authentically Native American in origin. But, as early as 1849, when the document was republished by [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim G. Squier]], [[Henry Schoolcraft|Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] wrote to Squier saying that he believed the document might be fraudulent.<ref name=arc>{{harvnb|Jackson|Rose|2009}}</ref> In the 1950s the [[Indiana Historical Society]] published a "re-translation" of the ''Walam Olum'', as "a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture".<ref>''Walam Olum: or, Red Score, The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians.'' See {{harvnb|Voegelin|1954}}</ref>

Later linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological and [[textual analysis|textual analyses]], particularly from the 1980s and 1990s onward, suggested that the ''Walam Olum'' account was largely or entirely a fabrication, and described its record of authentic Lenape traditional migration stories as spurious.<ref name="Oestreicher"/> After the publication in 1995 of [[David Oestreicher]]'s thesis, ''The Anatomy of the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Anthropological Hoax'', many scholars concurred with his analysis, and concluded that Rafinesque had been either the perpetrator, or perhaps the victim, of a hoax.<ref name="Oestreicher">{{harvnb|Oestreicher|2005}}</ref> Other scholars, writers, and some among the Lenape continue to find the account plausible and support its authenticity.<ref name="Oestreicher"/>

===Study of prehistoric cultures===
[[File:Examples of how to calculate the value of Mayan numerals.gif|thumb|left|Examples of calculating the value of Mayan numerals]]
Rafinesque made a notable contribution to North American prehistory with his studies of ancient [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthworks]], especially in the [[Ohio Valley]]. He was the first to label these the "Ancient Monuments of America." He listed more than 500 such archaeological sites in [[Ohio]] and [[Kentucky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2004|p=91}}</ref> Rafinesque never excavated;<ref>{{harvnb|Boewe|2000|p=xxiii}}</ref> rather, he recorded the sites visited by careful measurements, sketches, and written descriptions. Only a few of his descriptions found publication, but his work was used by others. For instance, he identified 148 sites in Kentucky. All sites in Kentucky which were included by [[E. G. Squier]] and Davis in their notable ''Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley'' (1848), were originally identified by Rafinesque in his manuscripts.<ref>{{harvnb|Boewe|2000|p=xxv}}</ref>

Rafinesque also made contributions to [[Mesoamerica]]n studies. The latter were based on linguistic data which he extracted from printed sources, mostly those of travelers. He designated as ''[[Ta<U+00ED>no language|Taino]]'', the ancient language of the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hulme|1993}}</ref> Others later also used the term to identify the [[ethnicity]] of indigenous Caribbean peoples.

Although mistaken in his presumption that the ancient [[Maya script]] was [[alphabetical]] in nature, Rafinesque was probably first to insist that studying modern [[Mayan languages]] could lead to deciphering the ancient script. In 1832 he was the first to partly decipher ancient Maya. He explained that its [[Maya numerals|bar-and-dot symbols]] represent fives and ones, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Houston|Stuart|Chinchilla Mazariegos|2001|p=45}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chaddha|2008}}</ref>

[[File:Rafinesquia neomexicana capitulum 2005-04-01.jpg|thumb|The genus ''[[Rafinesquia]]'' was named in Rafinesque's honor.]]

===Legacy===
[[Thomas Nuttall]] named a new genus ''Rafinesquia'' after Rafinesque in 1841, feeling indebted to Rafinesque after he had given Nuttall's ''Flora'' a positive review.<ref>{{harvnb|Beidleman|2006|p=139}}</ref> It now contains two species, ''[[Rafinesquia californica]]'' Nutt. (California Plumeseed or California Chicory) and ''[[Rafinesquia neomexicana]]'' A. Gray (Desert Chicory or Plumeseed).<ref>{{harvnb|Morhardt|Morhardt|2004|p=71}}</ref>

In 1892 [[James Hall (paleontologist)|James Hall]] and J. M. Clarke proposed the genus name ''[[Rafinesquina]]'' in honor of Rafinesque for a number of fossil [[brachiopod]] species<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|Davis|2009|p=272}}</ref> then belonging to genus ''[[Leptaena]]''; the genus is now in the family Rafinesquinidae.
