'''Earl W. Bascom''' ([[June 19]], [[1906]] - [[August 28]], [[1995]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[painting|painter]], [[printmaking|printmaker]] and [[sculpting|sculptor]], raised in [[Canada]], who portrayed his own experiences cowboying and rodeoing across the [[American West|American]] and [[Canadian]] [[American Old West|West]].
== Childhood ==
Earl Bascom was born in a sod-roofed [[log cabin]] on the Bascom 101 Ranch in [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], [[Utah]].  His father, John W. Bascom, had been a deputy [[sheriff]] in Utah who chased [[Butch Cassidy]] and the Wild Bunch Gang.  Both sets of Earl's grandparents (Joel A. Bascom and C.F.B. Lybbert) were [[Mormons|Mormon pioneers]],<ref> [http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/library/pioneercompanysearch/  List of Mormon pioneers]</ref> ranchers and frontier lawmen. 

Earl Bascom's paternal ancestral background was a colorful aray of nationalities and ethnicities including [[Quaker]], French [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Huguenot]], as well as an American [[Colonial]] [[Governor]], John Webster, and a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] soldier, Oliver Greene.<ref>[http://hometown.aol.com/iplayvn/ "Earl's ancestors Herodius Long was a Quaker, Gilbertus Bask'omme was a French Basque nobleman and Robert Bascom was a Huguenot"]</ref>  His maternal family was of [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Holland|Dutch]] and [[Germany|German]] ancestry.<ref>[http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/k/e/r/Debbie-M-Kerkes/ "Earl's maternal grandmother, Antonette Marie Olsen Lybbert, was from Oslo, Norway; his maternal grandfather, C.F.B. Lybbert, was from Flade, Denmark but was of German, Prussian and Dutch ancestry"]</ref>  As a child growing up, he was sometimes affectionately addressed by his British-born aunts as "Lord Bascom - [[Monarch|King]] of the Canadian Cowboys," as he was a descendant of [[Europe]]an [[royalty]] back to [[Charlemagne]].  

While Bascom was still a child his family moved to the Bascom Bar-B-3 Ranch in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].  He quit school while in grade three to work on the Hyssop 5H Ranch.  Although he was soon marched back to school by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], Earl was reprieved to get the job of driving an old [[stagecoach]] each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from school.<ref>[http://www.cowboydirectory.com/B/b-arl.html "Earl's father got the contract to drive the school district's coach wagon using a team of horses from the Bascom Ranch"]</ref>

== Cowboy ==
Earl Bascom was known as the ''[[Cowboy]] of Cowboy Artists'' due to his wide range of western experiences as a professional [[bronc buster]], [[cowpuncher]], trail driver, [[blacksmith]], [[freighter]], [[wolf]] hunter, [[wild horse]] chaser, [[rodeo]] champion, cattle rancher, dude [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]], and [[Hollywood]] [[actor]].<ref>Roundup Magazine "Rodeo Champion - Cowboy Artist Earl W. Bascom" (December 1995, Volume III Number 2)</ref>  Bascom was among the last of those who experienced the [[American Old West|Old West]] before the end of free-range ranching.  Bascom reminisced:
{{cquote|I worked for some of the big open-range outfits from [[Taber, Alberta|Purple Springs]] to the [[Sweetgrass, Montana|Sweetgrass Hills]] and [[Kicking Horse River|Kicking Horse Creek]] to the [[Milk River Ridge]] and the [[Canadian Rockies]].  On one roundup some 7,000 horses were gathered in one bunch a mile wide.  And the Knight Ranch dipped 18,000 head of cattle.  What a sight to see.  The sight, the sounds, the smell I can still remember.<ref>"American Hero Earl W. Bascom". (Summer 1995), ''United Lumbee Nation Times'' </ref>}}

=== Professional Cowboy ===
For Earl [[Bascom]], ranch life and cowboy life was his life.  "The life of a cowboy and the West, I know," he stated.<ref>Alberta Beef "Cowboy Artist, Earl W. Bascom" (October 1995, page 30)</ref> Bascom worked on some of the largest horse and cattle ranches in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] <U+2014> ranches that ran thousands of [[cattle]] on a million acres (4000 km<U+00B2>) of land. He broke and trained hundreds of horses.  He worked on ranches where he chased and gathered [[horse]]s, [[cow]]s and even [[donkey]]s in [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Washington]], [[California]] and Canada.  He worked on cattle drives out of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and horse drives through the [[Teton Range]]. He took part on large roundups of horses and cattle, and brandings. He made [[Western saddle|saddles]] and [[stirrup]]s, [[quirt]]s, [[chaps]], [[spur]]s, [[bridle]]s and [[horse tack#Bits|bits]], [[rope]]s and [[hackamore]]s, and even patched his own [[cowboy boot|boots]].<ref>Buckle News "Rodeo Champion - Cowboy Artist, Earl W. Bascom, Rides into Sunset" (November 1995, pages 6 and 7)</ref> Earl's father, John W. Bascom, and Earl's brothers were all experienced ranch cowboys.

=== Rodeo Rider ===

A professional rodeo cowboy, Earl Bascom rodeoed from [[1916]] to [[1940]] in the rough stock events of saddle bronc riding, bareback riding and [[bull riding]], and in the timed events of steer decorating and [[steer wrestling]].<ref>ProRodeo Sports News "Bascom dies at 89" (September 13, 1995)</ref>  He also performed [[trick riding]].<ref>Smith, Norma, editor, ''Our Town 2002: Raymond Stampede Centennial'' (Raymond Historical Society, page 53) ISBN 0-9685225-4-8  "Earl and Weldon learned trick riding from their boyhood friend and world champion trick rider Ted Elder who gave one of his extra trick saddles to them to perform on."</ref>  He held memberships in the [[Cowboys Turtle Association]], the [[PRCA|Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]], the [[Canadian Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (now the [[Canadian Pro Rodeo Association]]) and the [[National Police Rodeo Association]].  An all-around rodeo champion, he has been inducted into several rodeo [[Hall of Fame|Halls of Fame]] in Canada and the United States.  He received international acclaim for his rodeo equipment [[invention]]s and [[design]]s.<ref>[http://www.vvdailypress.com/2005/112799882391592.html/ "Bascom's influence on European rodeo is acknowledged by the European Rodeo Cowboys Association"]</ref> Earl's brothers - Raymond "Tommy" Bascom, Melvin "High Pockets" Bascom and Weldon "Preacher" Bascom - were also professional rodeo cowboys and Hall of Fame inductees.

=== Mississippi Rodeo ===
During his college years, Earl and his brother Weldon produced the first rodeos in [[Columbia, Mississippi]] in 1935, 1936 and 1937 while working for Sam Hickman's B Bar H Ranch near Arm, Mississippi.  Hickman financed these rodeos.  Between rodeos of 1936 and 1937, Earl was a missionairy for the LDS Church in Mississippi serving under Mission President LeGrand Richards.

=== Marriage ===
In 1939, Earl married Nadine Diffey, who was part [[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. He met her in Mississippi while cowboying and rodeoing there. They were married in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and raised five children. Later in life, [[Nadine Bascom]] became a sculptor in her own right, creating [[bas-relief]] sculptures.

=== Rodeo Clown ===
Besides being a serious-minded rodeo contestant, Earl tried his hand as a [[rodeo clown]] and [[Rodeo Bullfighter|rodeo bullfighter]] during his rodeo career. Just after his 89th birthday, Earl was honored as the oldest living rodeo clown in the world.<ref>Vernal Express (August 30, 1995 "World's oldest living rodeo clown and bullfighter dies"</ref>

== Artist ==
=== Jim Thorpe's Influence ===
While working for the Nilsson Rafter-E-N Ranch, Earl happened to read a story in a western magazine about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Jim Thorpe]].  Thorpe had been working as a horse wrangler, but got fired.  The camp cook gave him some advice  - go to school.  Thorpe took that advice, went to school, excelled in sports and became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion.

Jim Thorpe<U+2019>s life touched Earl Bascom<U+2019>s.  "I felt like I had walked in his boots," Earl said.  "Like Jim Thorpe, cowboy life was the only life that I knew.  But what about my art, what about art school?"<ref> United Lumbee Nation Times, ibid. </ref>

=== Russell and Remington's influence ===
Wanting to be an artist since childhood, Earl Bascom filled the pages of his school books in the one-room school house he attended with cowboy scenes.  Earl Bascom<U+2019>s desire to be a cowboy artist was greatly enhanced after seeing art works of the two great icons of [[American Old West|Old West]] art, [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles M. Russell]] and [[Frederic Remington|Frederic S. Remington]] - both cousins to Earl<U+2019>s father (Remington and Russell were both related to Bascom through their mothers, Clarissa Bascom Sackrider Remington and Mary Elizabeth Mead Russell, respectively).  Charles Russell was on the Knight Ranch when Earl was working there, and had drawn a [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] on the bunkhouse wall and also finished a large [[oil painting]] of [[Raymond Knight]] on his favorite mount, Blue Bird, roping a [[steer]].<ref>[http://www.cowboydirectory.com/B/b-arl.html "The bridle headstall shown on C. M. Russell's depiction of the horse, Blue Bird, was the same one that Raymond Knight gave to Earl as payment for breaking a horse for him"]</ref>

Earl only completed one full year of school and never finished [[high school]], but he never lost his desire to be an artist.  He subscribed to a correspondence art course wherein both Russell and Remington gave instructions on their drawing techniques.  "Through those art lessons these two masters of western art were my first real art teachers," Earl recalled.  "In fact the only instructions I ever had in western art were from Remington and Russell."<ref>United Lumbee Nation Times, ibid.</ref>

=== College Art Training ===
Even though he had no high school diploma, the [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]] accepted him as a student in the fall of [[1933]].  <U+201C>There I was a 27 years old college freshman who hadn<U+2019>t been to school in years,<U+201D> Earl recalled.  <U+201C>I felt like a wild horse in a pen.<U+201D><ref> ibid </ref>  But his persistence was tough, taking every art course the college offered.  He studied painting and drawing under professors [[E.H. Eastmond]] and [[B.F. Larsen]], and sculpture under [[Torlief Knaphus]].  Earl graduated from [[Brigham Young University|B.Y.U.]] in [[1940]]. Later he attended classes at [[Long Beach City College]], [[Victor Valley College]] and the [[University of California Riverside]].

=== Hollywood ===
In 1917, Earl saw his first [[Hollywood]] movie "The Silent Man" with [[William S. Hart]].  Earl and his older brother Melvin were extras in a silent movie in 1920 being filmed in Lethbridge, Alberta.  In 1924, a team of [[palomino]] horses from the Bascom Ranch was used by [[Hoot Gibson]] in the movie "The [[Calgary Stampede]]." After graduating from college, Earl and his wife moved to [[California]]. Retiring from rodeo, he pursued his art career and ranched. He worked a bit in the movie industry with his brother Weldon Bascom in the [[Hollywood]] [[western (genre)|western]], "The Lawless Rider", starring Weldon's wife Texas Rose Bascom.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059679/ "Texas Rose Bascom"]</ref> Later Earl and his son-in-law Mel Marion did TV commercials with [[Roy Rogers]] for the Roy Rogers Restaurant chain. Earl and his son [[John Bascom]] were in the documentary "Take Willy With You" about the rodeo riding [[Greenough]] family.  When the Roy Rogers Riding Stables opened up in [[Apple Valley, California]], Earl and his son John worked there wrangling horses and driving the [[hay]] [[wagon]].

=== Art teacher ===
In 1966, after getting his teaching certificate, Earl taught art classes at John F. Kennedy High School and at Barstow High School.  He also served as president of the High Desert Artists, and later as president of the Buckaroo Artists of America.  Among his art associates were Bill Bender, Charles LaMonk. Leslie B. DeMille, Glen Turner and Cecil Smith.

=== International Artist ===
Earl Bascom became internationally known as a cowboy artist and sculptor.  His art has been exhibited in the United States, [[Canada]] and [[Europe]].  He was honored by the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Artists Association as the first rodeo cowboy to become a professional cowboy artist and sculptor.   He was the first cowboy artist to be honored as a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] of [[London]].  In the summer of [[2005]], the Earl W. Bascom Memorial Rodeo was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] where his cowboy art was exhibited as an honor by the European Rodeo Cowboys Association for Bascom's world-wide influence upon the sport of rodeo.

== Later Years ==
Always one who had deep thoughts and religious leanings, Earl Bascom was ordained a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] [[Bishop (Mormonism)|Bishop]] later in life.  As the late cowboy celebrity [[Roy Rogers]], who worked with Earl Bascom in TV commercials and was a collector of Bascom art, once said, <U+201C>Earl Bascom is a walking book of history.  His knowledge of the Old West was acquired the old fashioned way <U+2013> he was born and raised in it.<U+201D><ref> Johnston, Ron (2007). ''Famous Mormons, Interesting Profiles of Well-known Latter-day Saints'' (Spring Creek, pages 13-14). ISBN 978-1-932898-57-6 </ref>

Bascom died at the age of 89 on his ranch in [[Victorville, California]], [[August 28]], [[1995]].
