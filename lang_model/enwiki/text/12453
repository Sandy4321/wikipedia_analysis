In addition to the career steals record, Henderson also holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in {{by|1982}}) and is the only player in [[American League]] (AL) history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times.

Henderson was named the AL's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in {{by|1990}}, and he was the leadoff hitter for two World Series champions: the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|1989 Oakland A's]] and the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|1993 Toronto Blue Jays]]. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-year career elevated Henderson to the top ten in several other categories, including career [[at bat]]s, games, and outfield [[putout]]s and [[total chances]]. His high [[on-base percentage]], power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dynamic players of his era. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans.

When asked if he thought Henderson was a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]], [[sabermetrics|statistician]] [[Bill James]] replied, "If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballmusings.com/archives/003774.php |last=Pinto|first=David|title= Neyer On Sabermetrics and Race|publisher=Baseball Musings (via Internet Archive)|accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref>

In 1976, Henderson graduated from [[Oakland Technical High School]], where he played baseball, [[basketball]] and [[American football|football]], and was an [[All-America]]n [[running back]] with a pair of 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He received two dozen scholarship offers to play football, but turned them down on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Baseball Report.

==Major leagues==

[[Image:Baseball steal.jpg|thumb|left|Henderson steals third base for the New York Yankees in 1988.]]
Henderson was a [[Most Valuable Player]] candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135) and in steals (56). Finishing second to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Rollie Fingers]] in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only [[Gold Glove Award]]. He later became known for his [[Showboat#Showboating|showboating]] "snatch catches," in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Rickey|coauthors=John Shea|title=Off Base: Confessions of a Thief|pages=1<U+2013>10|publisher=HarperCollins|month=June | year=1992|isbn=0-0601-7975-9}}</ref>

In {{Baseball Year|1982}}, Henderson broke [[Lou Brock]]'s modern major league record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93. [[Tim Raines]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] had the next highest stolen base total in 1982, with 78.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Lou_Brock_1939 | title=The Ballplayers - Lou Brock | publisher=Baseball Library | year=2006 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season.  As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter. His increasing power-hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in {{by|1986}} and again in {{by|1990}}.<ref name="BBRef">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/henderi01.shtml |title=Rickey Henderson Statistics|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work= }}</ref>

Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his [[strike zone]] without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter [[Jim Murray (sportswriter)|Jim Murray]] described Henderson's strike zone as being "smaller than Hitler's heart".<ref name="sportsillustrated1">{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1029027/6/index.htm |title=The greatest leadoff hitter of all time is beating the - 06.23.03 - SI Vault |publisher=Vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com |author=Tom Verducci |date=June 23, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref> In 1982, he described his approach to ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'':
{{quote|I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year [[Ed Ott]] of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Angels]] got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, "Stand up and hit like a man."

===New York Yankees (1985&ndash;1989)===
[[Image:Rickey henderson.jpg|thumb|Henderson playing for the New York Yankees in 1988]]
In {{by|1985}}, Henderson was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] for five players.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/New_York_Yankees |title=New York Yankees - BR Bullpen |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref> That year he led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in the league in walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), and had 24 home runs while hitting .314.<ref name="1985 AL Leaders">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1985.shtml |title=1985 American League (AL) Statistics and Awards |accessdate=2008-08-16 |work= |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= }}</ref> He also won the [[Silver Slugger Award]], and was third in the voting for the MVP award.

Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did the Reds' [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]]; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the "80/20 club".<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="Eric Davis Statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/d/daviser01.shtml |title=Eric Davis Statistics |accessdate=2008-08-16 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |work=}}</ref>

Seattle's [[Harold Reynolds]] led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season:
:"The phone rings.  'Henderson here.'  I say, 'Hey, what's going on, Rickey?'  I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, '''Sixty'' stolen bases?  You ought to be ashamed.  Rickey would have 60 at the break.'  And then click, he hung up."<ref>Rickey Henderson: Leadoff Legend, 2009, MLB Network</ref>
 
In {{by|1988}}, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305.<ref name="BBRef" /> While only in New York for four and a half seasons, Henderson stole 326 bases, and on June 4, 1988 he broke the previous franchise record of 248 held by [[Hal Chase]].<ref name="Yankees SB Record">{{cite web |title=New York Yankees Batting Leaders|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/leaders_bat.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

===Back to Oakland (1989&ndash;1993)===
Following a mid-season trade to Oakland in {{by|1989}}, Henderson reasserted himself as one of the game's greatest players, with a memorable half-season in which his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the A's into the postseason;<ref name="BBRef"/> his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since {{by|1970}}. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the [[1989 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five [[runs batted in]] (RBI), seven walks and a 1.000 [[slugging percentage]]. Leading the A's to a four-game sweep over the [[San Francisco Giants]] and the franchise's first [[1989 World Series|World Series]] title since [[1974 World Series|1974]], Henderson hit .474 with a .895 slugging average (including two [[triple (baseball)|triples]] and a homer), while stealing three more bases.<ref name="BBRef"/>

A [[1990 in baseball|year later]], Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the [[Kansas City Royals]]' [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, his on-base percentage was a league-leading .439. With 119 runs scored, 28 homers, 61 RBI and 65 stolen bases, Henderson won the AL's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] (.333 batting, .667 slugging, three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/yr1990ws.shtml |title=1990 World Series by Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date= |work=}}</ref>

On May 1, {{by|1991}}, Henderson [[#Legacy|broke]] one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than [[Lou Brock]]'s total compiled from 1963 to 1979, mainly with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].<ref name="number939">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/261179/Rickey-Henderson#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Rickey%20Henderson%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Rickey Henderson |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2008-02-17|work= }}</ref>

===Toronto Blue Jays, 1993===
In July {{by|1993}}, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Herrera (1990s outfielder)|Jos<U+00E9> Herrera]].<ref name="BBRef"/> He was involved in the final play of the [[1993 World Series|World Series]] that year, as he and [[Paul Molitor]] scored on [[Joe Carter]]'s Series-ending [[walk-off home run]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Sweet Homer|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/1998/wsarchive/1993.html|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=1993-11-01|last=Rushin|first=Steve}}</ref> After winning his second World Series ring with Toronto, he re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.<ref name="BBRef"/>

===1994-2000===

In {{by|1994}} and {{by|1995}}, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/henderi01.php |title=Rickey Henderson |publisher=The Baseball Page |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref> His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.

He signed with the [[San Diego Padres]] in the offseason, where he had another respectable year in {{by|1996}}, again finishing in the top ten in the [[National League]] (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.<ref name=dailytex>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/04/25/Sports/Stolen.Base.King.Rickey.Henderson.Knots.Up.Ruths.Walk.Mark-700155.shtml|publisher=Daily Texan Online|title=Stolen base king Rickey Henderson knots up Ruth's walk mark|accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref> In August {{by|1997}}, he was traded by the Padres to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] for [[Ryan Hancock]] and [[Stevenson Agosto]];<ref name="BBRef"/> his brief stint as an Angel was uneventful.

A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the [[New York Mets]]. In {{by|1999}}, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage &mdash; his .423 OBP was his ninth year in a row above .400.<ref name="BBRef"/><ref>{{cite web|title=1999 On Base Percentage Leaders: Top 25 in the National League|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-25|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/top25.php?s=OBP&l=NL&y=1999}}</ref> Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. He broke with team tradition and wore number 24, which&mdash;although not officially retired&mdash;had not been worn by a Mets player since [[Willie Mays]]' retirement in 1973 (the number was accidentally issued to [[Kelvin Torve]] in 1990, and quickly changed).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faithandfear.blogharbor.com/blog/_archives/2007/5/18/2959967.html |title=Retire 24 |publisher=Faith and Fear in Flushing |accessdate=2008-12-02 |work= }}</ref> Following the Mets' loss in the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]], the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and [[Bobby Bonilla]].

===2001&ndash;2003===
A free agent in March {{by|2001}}, he returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, Henderson broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s record of 2,062 career walks,<ref name=dailytex/> [[Ty Cobb]]'s record of 2,246 career runs,<ref>{{cite web|title=Henderson Breaks Cobb's Record in Style|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-28|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E4D9173CF936A35753C1A9679C8B63|date=2001-10-05}}</ref> and [[Zack Wheat]]'s record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher [[John Thompson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EEDB133CF93BA35753C1A9679C8B63|title=Henderson: It's an Even 3,000 Hits|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=2001-10-08}}</ref> That final game was also Padre legend [[Tony Gwynn]]'s last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Credit to Cooperstown|first=Al|last=Doyle|publisher=Baseball Analysts|url=http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2007/01/a_credit_to_coo.php|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=2007-01-25}}</ref> After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup.  It is the first and only game in Major League History in which a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits (Gwynn had 3,141). 
[[Image:Rickeyhenderson2002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henderson with Boston in 2002]]
At the age of 42, in his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL;<ref name="BBRef"/> it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals.<ref name="BBRef"/> Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of {{by|2002}}, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bss.sfsu.edu/tygiel/hist490/statistics/stolen_base_leaders_19472002.htm |publisher=San Francisco State University|title=Stolen Base Leaders 1947<U+2013>2002 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work=Course Outline - History 490: The History and Literature of Baseball }}</ref>

In February 2002, he signed as a free agent with the [[Boston Red Sox]], where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play [[center fielder|center field]] in major league history when he replaced [[Johnny Damon]] for three games in April and another in July<!--April 26-27-29, July 24-->. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity. During the 22-1/2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. The Red Sox finally "passed" Henderson on April 30, 2002. At 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/Oldest_leagues.shtml | title=A Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records for Oldest Player | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com | date=2007-10-28 | accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref>

As the {{by|2003}} season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] with the [[Newark Bears]], hoping for a chance with another major league organization. After much media attention, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] signed him over the All-Star break.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE1DF1F3AF931A25751C1A96E958260 |title=BASEBALL; Mets and Henderson Are Closing In On Deal|author=Diamos, Jason|publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

===Retirement===
Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: 
{{quote|Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it.  We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7.  Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays.  You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career.  Instead, I think people want me to quit more than anything.<ref name=Manoloff />}}

Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return to major league action, his status continued to confound, as he publicly debated his own official retirement from professional baseball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/12/07/SPGALG46E51.DTL|title=Rickey's retirement plans: will he or won't he?|author=|accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the [[Newark Bears]] in the spring of 2004. In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.<ref name="Baseball Cube" /> On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the [[San Diego Surf Dawgs]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]], an independent league. This was the SurfDawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenbaseball.com/SanDiego/PlayersBio.aspx?PlayerID=280&SecID=397 |title=San Diego Surf Sawgs|publisher=Golden Baseball League|accessdate=2008-03-09 |work= }}</ref>

Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. [[NBC]] and [[ESPN]] reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off," adding, "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5417&mode=print |title=The Week In Quotes: August 7-13|last=Erhardt|first=John|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |work= }}</ref>

On May 8, 2007, Henderson again expressed his unquenchable desire to return to major league action: "I see [[Roger Clemens|Roger]] [Clemens] can come back and play. I can come back and play. They say I've done too much... I might come out with some crazy stuff, a press conference telling every club, 'Put me on the field with your best player and see if I come out of it.' If I can't do it, I'll call it quits at the end... I just want a spring training invite... I'm through, really. I'm probably through with it now. It's just one of those things. I thank the good Lord I played as long as I played and came out of it healthy. I took a lot of pounding."<ref name=McCauley>{{cite web|title=Henderson would like one more chance to make a big league team|author=McCauley, Janie|publisher=Associated Press via Yahoo!

On May 18, 2007, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that Oakland general manager [[Billy Beane]] was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not "infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season," so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Rickey Reunion?|last=Slusser|first=Susan|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 18, 2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/18/SPG11PTFL91.DTL|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum <U+2014> and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me...

Henderson finally conceded his "official retirement" on July 13, 2007: "I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired." Characteristically, he added, "If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/SPORTS/707140340 |title=Mets name Henderson new first-base coach; HoJo replaces Down as hitting coach |publisher=The Times Herald Record|agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref>

Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009 Hall of Fame vote]], in his first appearance on the ballot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/6187-the-class-of-2009-who-will-join-rickey |title=The Class of 2009: Who Will Join Rickey?|publisher=Bleacher Report |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work= }}</ref>  At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, <U+201C>I believe today, and people say I<U+2019>m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game."<ref>

===Coaching===
The [[New York Mets]] hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach basestealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on [[Jos<U+00E9> Reyes (shortstop)|Jos<U+00E9> Reyes]], the Mets' current leadoff hitter.<ref>{{cite news|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Untitled|page=57|publisher=Time Inc.|date=May 7, 2007}}</ref> "I always want to be around the game," Henderson said in May 2007. "That's something that's in my blood.  Helping them have success feels just as good."<ref name=McCauley />

On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]], who became the hitting coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ti-metshittingcoach071307&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Mets to name Johnson hitting coach |name=Tim Brown |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-10-03 |publisher=Yahoo Sports}}</ref> Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008.

==Illeism, malapropism and anecdotes==
[[Sports Illustrated]]'s [[Tom Verducci]] wrote in 2003, "There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: [[Johnny Appleseed]]. [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. [[Davy Crockett]]. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction."<ref>

Henderson was known for being an [[illeism|illeist]], referring to himself in the third person. Teammates reported seeing him standing naked in front of a mirror before a game, practicing his swing, and declaring, "Rickey's the best! Rickey's the best!"<ref name="marchman">{{cite journal|title=Rickey Henderson A Steal for the Mets|author=Marchman, Tim|journal=The New York Sun |page=1|date=July 17, 2007|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/58365|accessdate=2007-07-13|doi=10.1038/35046237|volume=408}}</ref> According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager [[Kevin Towers]] and left this message: "Kevin, this is Rickey.

But it's been blown way out of proportion. I say it when I don't do what I need to be doing. I use it to remind myself, like, `Rickey, what you doing, you stupid....'

There are many anecdotes about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as [[Steve Finley]] or [[Tony Gwynn]]) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had [[tenure]]. Henderson replied, "Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years."<ref name="tenure"/> Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Henderson's antics tarnish his brilliant career|author=Heyman, Jon|journal=The Sporting News via FindArticles|page=1|date=April 17, 2000|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_16_224/ai_61933906|accessdate=2007-06-24 | volume = 408 | doi = 10.1038/35046237}}</ref> In 2002, Henderson, in an argument with pitcher [[Orlando Hern<U+00E1>ndez]], stated, "He needs to grow up a little bit.

Olerud was reported to have replied, "That was me." The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays.

Verducci wrote, "Rickey is the modern-day [[Yogi Berra]], only faster."

On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass [[Lou Brock]] and become the sport's all-time stolen base leader.<ref name="number939"/> However, Henderson's achievement was somewhat overshadowed because [[Nolan Ryan]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], at age 44, set a record that same night by throwing his seventh career [[no-hitter]] in a game against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. One year earlier, Ryan had achieved glory at Henderson's expense by making him his 5,000th strikeout victim; Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, "If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smackbomb.com/nolanryan/art-imjustaman.html |title=The Nolan Ryan Express|publisher=The Nolan Ryan Express|agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-02-17 |work= }}</ref>

Henderson's speech (at right) after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was [[Muhammad Ali]], Henderson decided to use the words "greatest of all time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?mid=200808043235127 |title=MLB.com Rickey's 939 |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> These words have been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Real Rickey Henderson|author=Zingler, David|publisher=Simply Baseball Notebook|month=September | year=2002|url=http://z.lee28.tripod.com/sbnscoverstories/id12.html|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_62/ai_95915327|accessdate=2008-02-17 |title=One on one with Rickey Henderson: future Hall of Famer - Interview |work= Baseball Digest}}</ref>  Later that day, Brock amiably told reporters, "He spoke from his heart."  Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981.  Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, "How are we gonna break it?"<ref>Rickey Henderson: Leadoff Legend, 2009, MLB Network</ref>

Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments:
{{quote|As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.<ref name=Manoloff/>
}}

At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying, "In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was [[Muhammad Ali]]. He said at one time, 'I am the greatest.' That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am.... very, very humble. Thank you."

Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said:
{{quote|If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers?  That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.<ref name=Manoloff />}}

As it now stands, however, Henderson has 468 more stolen bases than Brock, one short of 50% more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Leaders & Records for Stolen Bases|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_career.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by [[Yutaka Fukumoto]] for the [[Hankyu Braves]] in Japan's [[Central League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/oak/history/timeline5.jsp |title=History: Athletics Timeline |accessdate=2008-03-09 |publisher=MLB.com }}</ref> In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_leagues.shtml|title=Year-by-Year League Leaders for Stolen Bases|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> when he missed part of the season due to a nagging [[hamstring]] injury,<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Henderson Placed on Disabled List|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=1987-08-02|publisher=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D7173CF931A3575BC0A961948260}}</ref> allowing Mariners second baseman [[Harold Reynolds]] to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader.<ref name="Cs1920">[http://www.baseball-statistics.com/Leaders/glossary.htm Glossary of terms; Baseball Statistics.com] - Caught stealing totals went largely unrecorded until 1920; it is therefore statistically likely that [[Eddie Collins]] (7th in steals) was thrown out more times than Henderson.</ref> However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. ([[Tim Raines]] ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6604|accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |title=Prospectus Q&A|work= }}</ref> On July 29, {{by|1989}}, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]], his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August {{by|1983}}, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games.

Longtime scout [[Charlie Metro]] remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/quohenr.shtml|accessdate=2008-02-17 |title=Rickey Henderson Quotes|publisher=Baseball Almanac }}</ref>  [[Baltimore Orioles]] third baseman [[Floyd Rayford]] described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.<ref name="sportsillustrated1" />

[[Joe Posnanski]] of the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote:
:"I<U+2019>m about to give you one of my all-time favorite statistics: Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning.
:He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, [[Roberto Clemente]], [[Luis Aparicio]], [[Ernie Banks]], [[Kirby Puckett]], [[Ryne Sandberg]] and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers...I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2008/12/09/oh-rickey-youre-so-fine/|title=Oh Rickey you<U+2019>re so fine <U+00BB> Joe Posnanski|publisher=joeposnanski.com|accessdate=2009-02-15

Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his basestealing technique at length with ''Sports Illustrated'':
:"I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting [[bruise|strawberries]] on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think."<ref>{{cite web

Padres closer [[Trevor Hoffman]] said, "I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with [[Babe Ruth]]."<ref name="sportsillustrated1"/> Padres general manager [[Kevin Towers]] said, "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has."<ref name="sportsillustrated1" />

[[Tony La Russa]], Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, "He rises to the occasion<U+2014>the big moment<U+2014>better than anybody I've ever seen."<ref name="sportsillustrated1"/> Coach [[Rene Lachemann]] said, "If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey."

A's pitching coach [[Dave Duncan (baseball)|Dave Duncan]] said of Henderson, "You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still." Sportswriter [[Tom Verducci]] wrote, "Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter century Henderson and [[Barry Bonds]] have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way [[Michael Jordan]] could a basketball game."<ref name="verduccei"/>
In July 2007, ''[[New York Sun]]'' sportswriter [[Tim Marchman]] wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: 
{{quote|He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain.  Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility.  And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline <U+2014> the discipline to work endless 1<U+2013>1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season.  Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.<ref name="marchman" />}}

===Career milestones===
{{As of|2008}}, Henderson ranks fourth all-time in career games played (3,081), tenth in at bats (10,961), twentieth in hits (3,055), and first in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406). His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by [[Barry Bonds]]; Henderson is now second. He also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; [[Alfonso Soriano]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] is tied for the second-most ever with [[Craig Biggio]], with 53. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from [[extra base hit]]s, walks, stolen bases, and times [[hit by pitch]]). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. [[Bill James]] wrote in 2000, "Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many ''important'' records, as Rickey Henderson."<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Free Press|year=2001|isbn=0-684-80697-5|pages=Unknown page|nopp=true}}</ref>

Henderson's eight steals during the [[1989 ALCS]] broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardinals postseason history|publisher=MLB|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20041002&content_id=879243&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=2004-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Position-by-position: Yanks in 6|publisher=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/00play/fs037.htm|date=2000-10-10|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by [[Kenny Lofton]]'s 34th career steal during the [[2007 ALCS]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenny Lofton sets postseason record for stolen bases|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&id=3066983|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Batting Postseason Leaders|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/leaders_career_bat.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref name="BBRef"/> Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season,<ref>{{cite web|title=Single Season Leaders for Stolen Bases in the American League|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2008-08-26|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisb2al.shtml}}</ref> and he is the all-time stolen base leader for two different franchises: the Oakland A's<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating 40 Years of Oakland Athletics|publisher=MLB|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/oak/fan_forum/anniversary.jsp|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref><ref name="BBRef"/> and the New York Yankees.<ref name="Yankees SB Record"/>

In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. In 2005, ''The Sporting News'' updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml|title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|author=|accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Baseball Almanac }}</ref> On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote.<ref name=Manoloff />

Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, "There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything." Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered." Of his various records and achievements, he values his career runs scored mark the most: "You have to score to win."<ref>
