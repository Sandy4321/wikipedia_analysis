'''Typhoon Muifa''' (international designation: '''''0425''''',<ref name="JMA best track">http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst2004.txt</ref> [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|JTWC]] designation: '''''29W''''', designated '''Typhoon Unding''' by [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name="PADNOV"/>) was a typhoon during the [[2004 Pacific typhoon season]]. The name Muifa is taken from the [[ume]] blossom.

A disturbance became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Muifa in the early of the 15th when centered east-southeast of [[Manila]], the [[Philippines]]. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knot]]s), still to the east of the Philippines. Unding, as [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]] named it, made landfall very late on the 19th near [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] with maximum winds of 80&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;knots). The storm briefly lost typhoon strength for a day until it regained typhoon intensity in the [[South China Sea]] on the 21st. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250&nbsp;nm south of [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Later that day Muifa turned northward into an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated {{convert|120|nmi|km}} south-southwest of Bangkok.

The highest 24&nbsp;hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4&nbsp;mm at [[Catanduanes]] between midday the 15th and 16th. The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for. A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged; total damage reached $1.0089&nbsp;billion pesos ($17.96&nbsp;million 2004 [[United States dollar|USD]]). The highest 24-hour rainfall amount reported in [[Thailand]] was 251.5&nbsp;mm at the [[Prachuap Khiri Khan]] airport between the afternoon of the 25th and 26th. Floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon killed about 40&nbsp;people, and 42 more people were reported missing.<ref name="PADNOV">[http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0411.htm Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary November 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Muifa 2004 track.png}}
The disturbance that was to become Muifa can be traced back to the afternoon of November 12, when a weak low-pressure system formed over the [[Mariana Islands|Western Marianas]].<ref name="naga city report">[http://www.typhoon2000.ph/stormarchives/2004/unding_report ::..Typhoon2000.com: Michael Padua's Full Detailed Report on Typhoon MUIFA (UNDING) ..::<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into a tropical storm while moving north-northwestward by early the 15th or late on the 14th when centered {{convert|550|mi|km|-1}} east-southeast of [[Manila, Philippines]]. PAGASA assigned the name Unding to the cyclone on the 14th as it passed the 135th meridian.<ref name="PADNOV"/>

The storm's forward speed suddenly decreased from 28&nbsp;km/h to 13&nbsp;km/h when it entered an area of weak steering flow in between a high-pressure ridge in development centered over China and a high-pressure ridge weakening south of Japan.<ref name="naga city report"/> On the 16th, the tropical cyclone started drifting north-northeast. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knot]]s) with a minimum central pressure of 955&nbsp;mbar (hPa), still to the east of the Philippines.<ref name="PADNOV"/>

Muifa made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;knots). The system ambled across the [[Philippines|Philippine Archipelago]], dropping down to tropical storm intensity on the afternoon of the 20th.<ref name="PADNOV"/> Shortly after Unding left the country, on the 22nd,<ref name="TRMM">[http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/publications_dir/philippine_16nov-2dec04.html TRMM<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Tropical Depression Merbok<ref name="ifrcstuff">[http://www.ifrc.org/cgi/pdf_appeals.pl?04/2604P.pdf Red Cross Red Crescent - Appeals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (Violeta)<ref name="ifrc">[http://www.ifrc.org/docs/news/04/04112201/ Over 30 killed as typhoon smashes into Philippines]</ref> passed over Luzon. Only five days after that,<ref name="TRMM"/> Typhoon<ref name="ifrcstuff"/> Winnie hit Luzon. Luzon was hit a third time by Typhoon Nanmadol on December 2. The Philippines being struck by four tropical systems so close together is a very rare event, and also very damaging.<ref name="TRMM"/>

On the 21st, Muifa regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea. Now moving west-southwest, early on the 22nd Muifa re-strengthened into a 105&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;knots) typhoon {{convert|440|mi|km|-1}} east of [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more.<ref name="PADNOV"/> At this point, it was forecast by the JTWC that Muifa would strike the southern tip of Vietnam with 65&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;knots) sustained winds. From there, it would restrengthen to typhoon strength and pass over [[Thailand]] and enter the [[Indian Ocean]], slowly weakening as it heads into the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name="dmha">[http://pdmin.coe-dmha.org/apdr/index.cfm?action=process3&Sub_ID=168&news=15919 Death toll rises from floods rises to 60 in northern Philippines in wake of Typhoon Muifa]</ref> This did not happen, though.

On the 25th, Tropical Storm Muifa accelerated westward at a 23&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;knots) clip. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250&nbsp;nm south of [[Bangkok]], Thailand.<ref name="PADNOV"/> It was still forecast by the JTWC that the depression would enter the [[Andaman Sea]], though much weaker than it was previously forecast, and later strike India as a 40&nbsp;mph (35&nbsp;knots) tropical cyclone.<ref name="alertnet">[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/TSR/29W.htm Typhoon Muifa]</ref> Once again, this did not occur. Later that day, Muifa turned northward instead and entered an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120&nbsp;nm south-southwest of Bangkok. But according to the [[Thailand Meteorological Department]] <!-- ? --> (TMD) advisories, Tropical Depression Muifa made landfall near [[Amphoe Tha Chana]], [[Surat Thani Province]] at around 1500 UTC on the 25th with winds of 35&nbsp;mph (30&nbsp;knots).<ref name="PADNOV"/>

==Preparations==
[[Clark Air Base]], an American air base on Luzon, had some 70 United States Marines and others evacuated to Okinawa via plane. Almost 3,000&nbsp;people were stranded in various places in the Philippines because the ferry crossings between [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and the central islands of the Philippines were forbidden to any vessel under 1,000 tons during the storm.<ref name="JTWC 2004 reports">[http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/2004atcr 2004 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Vietnamese government issued protective orders asking [[Petrovietnam]], an oil monopoly, to watch over oil drilling facilities. The facilities were also modified to withstand the typhoon. All but a few of the workers were evacuated before the storm came. Boats were also urged to return to shore somewhere else safe.<ref name="planet ark">[http://www.planetark.com/avantgo/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=28280 Planet Ark - Typhoon Muifa to Skirt Vietnam's Southern Coast<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Off-shore fishing also became forbidden. Youths in schools in [[C<U+00E0> Mau Province]] had as many days off as needed.<ref name="vnanet">[http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-11/25/Stories/04.htm Southern Viet Nam to bear the brunt of Typhoon Muifa]</ref>

Over 3,000&nbsp;people from [[Loi Quan Island]] in the [[Go Cong Dong District]] were evacuated to safer areas or shelters when asked by the government.<ref name="vnanet"/>

A United States-owned gas firm in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], [[Unocal Corporations]]s, was forced to shut down and evacuate at least 781&nbsp;people from the firm.<ref name="planet ark again">[http://www.planetark.com/avantgo/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=28284 Planet Ark - Typhoon Muifa Halts Unocal's Thai Drilling<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Impact==

===Philippines===
[[Image:Muifa partial rainfall.jpg|thumb|right|Rainfall from Muifa from November 13 to the 18th]]
There was an area of extreme rainfall measuring possibly {{convert|40|in|mm}} just east off the coast of southern Luzon. Much of southern Luzon and other portions of central Philippines received rainfall between 10 to {{convert|20|in|mm}}. [[Catanduanes]] and extreme southeastern Luzon might have been blanketed in as much as {{convert|35|in|mm}} of rain though.<ref name="earth observatory">[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=12583 EO Natural Hazards: Typhoon Muifa<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] only received a total of {{convert|8.26|in|mm}} of rainfall, but it was enough to flood some low-lying areas.<ref name="naga city report"/> The highest 24&nbsp;hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4&nbsp;mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th.<ref name="PADNOV"/> The passing of four cyclones in a short period of time as mentioned above caused a great deal of damage. Over 1,400&nbsp;people either died or were missing, mostly from Winnie. Rainfall from all systems was extremely high.<ref name="TRMM"/>

The lowest pressure at Naga City was 986.1 mb early on the 16th.<ref name="naga city report"/> Because of the high rainfall, over 3,000&nbsp;people had to be evacuated from the lowlands.<ref name="abc">http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1247867.htm</ref> A wind gust of {{convert|130|km/h|mph|disp=5|abbr=on}} coming from the north was measured in Naga City.<ref name="naga city report"/>

The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for.<ref name="PADNOV"/> Most of the casualties were adults, but two [[infants]] succumbed to [[hypothermia]],<ref name="ifrc"/> as did an elderly man in Catanduanes.<ref name="nidm">[http://www.nidm.net/disaster_updates-pdf/DISASTERS_UPDATE38.pdf Microsoft Word - DISASTERS_UPDATE38.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another twelve of those people were killed by a [[tornado]] associated with the storm that ripped through the coastal towns in [[Oriental Mindoro]] province.<ref name="unjobs">[http://unjobs.org/archive/8778526080746741813499793753865926092921 Philippines: GMA releases P5 M for typhoon victims in Oriental Mindoro]</ref> A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged,<ref name="PADNOV"/> with 40 of those homes being in Cataduanes.<ref name="nidm"/> Some areas reported 80% of the trees and electricity posts were destroyed.<ref name="ifrc"/> Total damage in the Philippines reached 1.0089&nbsp;billion pesos ($17.96&nbsp;million 2004 [[United States dollar|USD]], November 26, 2004 exchange rate).<ref name="PADNOV"/> At least fifteen provinces were affected by Unding.<ref name="abc"/>

===Vietnam===
Typhoon Muifa had a very devastating impact on Vietnam. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount reported was 251.5&nbsp;mm at Prachuap Khirikhan between the afternoon of the 25th and 26th.<ref name="PADNOV"/> Flooding from the torrential rains was seen in the low-lying places in and around the city of [[Hu<U+1EBF>]] and nearby districts.<ref name="Muifa passes with minimal damage">[http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-11/26/Stories/10.htm http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-11/26/Stories/10.htm]. ''Vietnam news''</ref>

The cyclone caused the 14 houses to collapse. An additional 85 home's roofs were blown off in [[C<U+00E0> Mau Province|C<U+00E0> Mau]]. Approximately 500&nbsp;square kilometres of [[paddy rice]], [[shrimp]], and [[fruit trees]] were annihilated. In the [[B<U+1EA1>c Li<U+00EA>u Province]], 34 houses fell, and another 90 or more were damaged to some degree. Five houses in the [[Kien Gian]] province were damaged and three fishing vessels sank off the coast.<ref name="Muifa passes with minimal damage"/> H<U+1ED9>i An, which is the town that was declared a world heritage site, was hit by the flood and submerged in more than 6&nbsp;feet (2&nbsp;meters) of water, and more than 83 old houses were in danger of collapse. In all, over 170,000 houses in five provinces were sumbmerged partially.<ref name="chinadaily">[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/29/content_395712.htm Vietnam flood kills 40]</ref>

Floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon killed about 40&nbsp;people, and 42 more people were declared missing.<ref name="chinadaily"/> At least three people were injured in the B<U+1EA1>c Li<U+00EA>u Province, while one fisherman was reported missing in [[Ki<U+00EA>n Giang]].<ref name="Muifa passes with minimal damage"/>

==Aftermath==
There were many relief operations setup throughout the Philippines very shortly after the cyclone moved into the South China Sea.<ref name="abc"/> The [[Philippine National Red Cross]] (PNRC) also mobilized 15 disaster response teams quickly. All together, there were about 1,000 volunteers helping the evacuation of the disaster-stricken families and in the initial relief operation.<ref name="ifrc"/> Two hundred sacks of rice and vegetables seeds were distributed by [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], president of the Philippines, throughout Oriental Mindoro.<ref name="unjobs"/>

The Philippine president also released a total of $5&nbsp;million pesos for cleaning up in Oriental Mindoro on November 25. $3&nbsp;million pesos went to rebuilding homes in [[Roxas]]. The other $2&nbsp;million pesos went to the provincial government's relief and rehabilitation efforts. A member of the country's congress also gave $10&nbsp;million pesos to be used for the hoped speedy rehabilitation of the province.<ref name="unjobs"/>

Residents that were evacuated in the coastal communities of Vietnam returned home on the morning of November 25. The families whose homes were damaged began to receive emergency relief aid.<ref name="Muifa passes with minimal damage"/> But there were also many villages in the mountains which needed urgent relief but which could not be quickly reached.<ref name="PADNOV"/>

The name that PAGASA gave to Muifa, Unding, was retired following this storm. The name selected to replace it was ''Ulysses''.<ref name="PAGASA Names">{{cite web|author=Typhoon 2000|year=2008|title=The Philippine Tropical Cyclone Names|accessdate=2008-06-05|url=http://www.typhoon2000.ph/names.htm}}</ref>
