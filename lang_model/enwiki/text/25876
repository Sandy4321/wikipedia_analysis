'''''The Great Milenko''''' is the fourth studio album released by [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Duet (music)|duo]] [[Insane Clown Posse]]. Released in 1997, it is the fourth entry in the group's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Cards]] series. 

The album was recorded and initially released by the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned [[record label]] [[Hollywood Records]].<ref name="Disney"/> The group altered the content of its lyrics at the label's request. The album was deleted by Hollywood hours after its release, in response to criticism from the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]] of decisions that the church believed did not reflect Disney's family-friendly image, although Disney claimed that the album was released due to an oversight by its review board.<ref name="Disney-controversy"/>

After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with [[Island Records]], which agreed to release the album as it was originally intended.<ref name="Island"/> "The Great Milenko" was eventually [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]].<ref name=RIAA/>

==Background==
In 1995, [[Insane Clown Posse]] attempted to obtain a contract with a major record label, signing with [[Jive Records]] sub-label Battery, which released its third studio album, ''[[Riddle Box]]'', but showed little interest in promoting the album.<ref name="BehindthePaint552">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=  |origmonth=August |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=552 |chapter=Complete Discography|year=2003 }}</ref> Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]-owned label [[Hollywood Records]], which reportedly paid US$1&nbsp;million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.<ref name="Disney">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

==Recording and production==
The group started recording ''The Great Milenko'' in 1996. Disney requested that the tracks "The Neden Game," "Under the Moon," and "Boogie Woogie Wu" be removed because of lyrics referencing abuse of women, rape and murder, and the slaughter of children, respectively. Disney also asked that the lyrics of other tracks be changed, threatening to not release the album otherwise.<ref name="BehindthePaint306">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=  |origmonth=August |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=306<U+2013>314 |chapter=Banned by a Filthy Rat|year=2003 }}</ref><ref name="Island">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430330/19970717/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Land on Island Records |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 17, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney's requests and planned to go on a national tour with [[House of Krazees]] and Myzery as its opening acts.<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/>

==Musical style==
''The Great Milenko'' featured more [[rock music|rock]] influences than previous Insane Clown Posse albums, including an introduction performed by [[Alice Cooper]]  and guitar tracks performed by [[Steve Jones]] (on "Piggie Pie"), and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (on "Halls of Illusions").<ref name="Liner"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote, in his review of ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]'' that, "''The Great Milenko'' [...] was targeted at white-boy, adolescent [[metalhead]]s -- really, how could any album that contained guest spots from Alice Cooper, Slash, Steve Jones and Legs Diamond be anything else?"<ref name="Erlewine">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:f9ftxqrkldje~T1 |title=Review of ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

==Lyrical themes==
{{cquote|From deep within the Nethervoids of shadow walkers comes yet anther exhibit of the Dark Carnival. He is the master of the art of using magic without magic. He is a Necromaster - the craft of using magic through the dead. Dead meaning both physically and mentally. This spectacle shall be witnessed only by those who are meant to see it. Look deep inside of your soul and ask yourself... Together you and he are the Great Milenko.<ref name="Liner"/>}}
According to the group's mythology, The Great Milenko is a [[Necromancer]] and [[Magic (illusion)|Illusionist]] who tries to trick individuals into [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|greed]] and other such [[sin]]s. He takes out the worst in an individual and creates powerful illusions in an attempt to cause them to become hedonistic and greedy. An honorable individual must fight his magic in order to make it to [[Heaven|Shangri-La]] (as revealed in the track "Pass Me By").<ref name="Liner">{{Cite music release notes| Name      = The Great Milenko| Artist    = Insane Clown Posse| Year      = 1997| Title     = The Great Milenko Liner Notes| Publisher = [[Island Records|Island]]/[[Psychopathic Records|Psychopathic]]

During a music-store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release,<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Browne">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of ''The Great Milenko'' |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=July 25, 1997 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 4, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref> The group was also informed that its in-store signings and nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the [[music video]] for "Halls of Illusions" (which had reached #1 on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label.<ref name="BehindthePaint306"/> It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist Church]] at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], in addition to producing and distributing the gay-themed television sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''.

After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, labels such as [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Death Row Records]] wanted to sign the group,<ref name="Disney-controversy"/> but [[Island Records]]' [[Chris Blackwell]] came to the group's rescue and agreed to release ''The Great Milenko'' as it was originally intended.<ref name="Island"/><ref name="BehindthePaint330">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=  |origmonth=August |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=09741846083 |pages=330<U+2013>335 |chapter=Disney's Hoe Tactics|year=2003 }}</ref> As part of the deal, Island also agreed to rerelease the group's first two Joker's Card albums. ''Milenko'' was released in four colors: red, green, purple, and gold. Each color had a different secret message that would help reveal the title of the fifth Joker's Card, ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''.<ref name="BehindthePaint556"/> [[Music video]]s were filmed for "Halls of Illusions," "How Many Times," and "Piggy Pie." An unofficial music video for "Down with the Clown" was featured on the home-video release ''Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling Volume 1''.<ref name="Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling Volume 1">{{cite video |date=2001 |title=Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling Volume 1 |medium=DVD |publisher=Psychopathic Video |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |accessdate=2008-06-06 |isbn=756504220092}}</ref> A music video for the Headhuntaz Remix of "Hokus Pokus" was produced after the release of the album.

Reviews were generally unfavorable. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' music critic [[David Browne]] gave the record a C-minus rating: "[With] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly [[rap metal|metal-rap]] tunes, the album feels oddly dated."<ref name="Browne"/> [[Allmusic]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called ''The Great Milenko'' "a better record than [its] predecessors, boasting a tougher sound and some actual hooks, without losing the juvenile vulgarity that pleased their following," but concluded that "although it is better than the rest of ICP's work, it's [...] the sort of record you wish they would take off the stereo at excruciating frat parties."<ref name="Erlewine"/> 

In ''The Great Rock Discography'', Martin Charles Strong gave the album five out of ten stars.<ref name="Strong"/> The album received two out of five stars in ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'', in which [[Ben Sisario]] identified it as the album in which "the group came into its own".<ref name="RSAlbumGuide"/> In 2009, ''[[Fangoria]]'' named it as an iconic [[horrorcore]] album.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Molgaard |first=Matt  |date=August 12, 2009 |title=''Rapped and Tagged: Horrorcore's Iconic Albums'' |journal=[[Fangoria]] |url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/reviews/3552-rapped-and-tagged-horrorcores-iconic-albums.html |accessdate=2009-08-19 |quote= }}</ref>
