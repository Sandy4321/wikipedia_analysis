'''Thomas Birch''', American portrait and marine painter; born in [[London]], England, in 1779; died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], January 3, 1851.

He came to the U. S. in 1794, and assisted his artist father, [[William Birch]], in preparing a 29-plate collection of engravings: "Birch's Views of Philadelphia" (1799).<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/birch/index.htm Birch's Views] from ushistory.org.</ref> Subscribers to the series included President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>William Birch, ''The City of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania as It Appeared in the Year 1800'', (1799), endpiece.</ref> This sold well and went into multiple editions, inspiring similar collected views of [[New York City]], and of suburban estates surrounding Philadelphia and [[Baltimore]]. The son's first major painting appears to have been a view of Philadelphia from the Treaty Elm in Kensington, which was also engraved and published in 1804.<ref>Munsing, ''Philadelphia: Three Centuries'', p. 229.</ref> He painted portraits until about 1807, when he took up marine-painting. Some of his most famous works depict naval battles of the [[War of 1812]].<ref>''[[Universal Cyclop<U+00E6>dia & Atlas]]'', 1902, New York, D. Appleton & Co.</ref> 

"Birch was the first American ship portraitist, and his paintings were copied by countless artists and craftsmen in America and Europe."<ref>Munsing, ''Philadelphia: Three Centuries'', p. 230.</ref> In addition to ships, they provide valuable images of bridges, lighthouses, docksides, and harbor fortifications in the Early Republic, especially those surrounding New York City and Philadelphia. His paintings of suburban mansions and rural snow scenes were often turned into engravings.

Historically, the Birches' most important work may be a circa-1801 engraving documenting the unfinished [[U.S. Capitol]]. Another, may be the son's painting depicting an 1812 naval battle between USS ''United States'' and HMS ''Macedonian'', that hung in the [[Oval Office]] of [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. It was sold at auction in 2008, setting a record price for the artist of $481,000.<ref>[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159437341 ''USS United States vs. HMS Macedonian'' (1813)] from Sotheby's Auction, 22 May 2008.</ref>

An assessment from 1867:
<blockquote>
''Marine landscapes were painted thirty years ago by an Englishman in Philadelphia &mdash; Thomas Birch. The freshness of his atmosphere and clearly-painted waves were a marked feature. His delineation of the engagement between the U.S. frigate ''Constitution'' and the British frigate ''Guerriere'', and that between the ''United States'' and the ''Macedonian'' &mdash; each four by two feet six inches &mdash; are fine specimens of this artist, and of rare historical value.''<ref>Henry T. Tuckerman, ''Book of the Artists'', (New York, 1867), p. 551.</ref>
</blockquote>

He exhibited regularly at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] for forty years, beginning in 1811, and managed the museum, 1812-17.<ref>Gerdts, Philadelphia Maritime Museum, pp. 12-13.</ref> His work is collected at [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|PAFA]]<ref>[http://www.pafa.org/Museum/The-Collection/View-All-Works/Artist/Collection-by-Artist/119/let__B/artistId__2592/ PAFA]; accessed January 29, 2007</ref>, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]],<ref>[http://www.librarycompany.org/artifacts/painters.htm LCP]; accessed January 6, 2010</ref> the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]],<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/222880.html?mulR=4754 PMA]; accessed January 6, 2010</ref> the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],<ref>[http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_artworks1.cfm?StartRow=1&ConID=6253&format=short&db=onlyart&LastName=&FirstName=&Title=&Accession=&Keyword= si.edu]; accessed January 29, 2007</ref> the [[U.S. Naval Academy]],<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/kn10000/kn10953.jpg USNA]; accessed January 6, 2010</ref> and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],<ref>[http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&id=258990&coll_keywords=&coll_accession=&coll_name=&coll_artist=Thomas+Birch&coll_place=&coll_medium=&coll_culture=&coll_classification=Watercolors&coll_credit=&coll_provenance=&coll_location=&coll_has_images=1&coll_on_view=&coll_sort=0&coll_sort_order=0&coll_view=0&coll_package=0&coll_start=1 mfa.org]; accessed January 29, 2007</ref> among others.
