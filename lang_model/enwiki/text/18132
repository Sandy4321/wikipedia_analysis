The Nissan Leaf employs an advanced [[telematics]] system called "Carwings" which originally was only available in Japan.<ref name=Carwings1>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/12/23/nissan-leaf-carwings-efficiency/|title=Nissan Leaf's CARWINGS keeps you up to speed, puts you in efficiency race|publisher=[[AutoblogGreen]]|author=Domenick Yoney|date=2010-12-23|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2008/01/28/nissan-carwings-telematics-system-gets-environmental-award-in-ja/|title=Nissan Carwings telematics system gets environmental award in Japan|publisher=[[AutoblogGreen]]|author=Sam Abuelsamid|date=2008-01-28|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> The system sends and receives data via a built-in [[GPRS]] radio similar to the connectivity of mobile phones.  Carwings is connected any time the car is in range of a cell tower and it makes possible several user functionalities, such as position and possible range on a map and which charging stations are available within range. The system also tracks and compiles statistics about distance traveled and energy consumption and produces daily, monthly and annual reports of these and several other operating parameters. All information is available in the Leaf's digital screens.<ref name=Carwings1/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/nissan-launches-carwings-connected-system-for-leaf-with-remote-control-and-rankings/|title=Nissan Launches CARWINGS Connected System for Leaf with Remote Control and Eco Rankings|work=[[Car and Driver]]|author=Michael Austin|date=2011-01-05|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  Users' mobile phones can be used to turn on the air-conditioner and heater, and reset charging functions even when the vehicle is powered down. This can be used to pre-heat or pre-cool the car prior to use. The advantage of doing this while still connected is so it does not discharge the battery and sets the climate before use. An on-board remote-controlled timer can also be pre-programmed to recharge batteries at a set time such as during off-peak rates.<ref name=LeafInfoSys>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/07/22/chelsea-sexton-nissan-leaf-uses-information-as-gateway-drug/|title=Nissan Leaf uses information as gateway drug|publisher=[[AutoblogGreen]]|author=[[Chelsea Sexton]]|date=2010-07-22|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> The Leaf's SL trim has a small solar panel at the rear of the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnettv.cnet.com/2011-nissan-leaf/9742-1_53-50080194.html|title=2011 Nissan Leaf - CNET |publisher=[[CNET]] CNET Car Tech|author=Brian Cooley|accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>

In October 2009, Nissan announced that it had reached an agreement with the local government of Mexico City, by which 500 units of the Leaf will be delivered by 2011 for use of government and corporate fleets. In exchange, [[charging station|recharging infrastructure]] will be deployed by the city government, and an exemption from the ownership tax is being pursued.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nissan alista puntos de recarga del Leaf|url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/negocios/2010/06/02/nissan-alista-puntos-de-recarga-del-leaf|publisher=CNN Expansion|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-09-26|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nissan aims to bring electric car to Mexico City in 2011|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nissan-aims-to-bring-electric-car-to-mexico-city-in-2011-2009-10-28|publisher=Market Watch|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref> This agreement will allow Mexico to become the first Latin American market where the Leaf will be available.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nissan Leaf heading south of the border to Mexico City |date=2009-11-03|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/11/03/nissan-leaf-heading-south-of-the-border-to-mexico-city//

==Reception==
Since the initial series of announcements in 2009, a former [[Tesla Motors]] marketing manager criticized Nissan about the cooling system chosen for thermal management in [[lithium-ion battery]] packs,<ref name=Wired/> which may be a factor to the long-term performance of the battery. There may also be an overestimation of the announced {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on|disp=flip}} range that was computed using LA-4 or "city" mode, which may underestimate the energy draw during highway driving conditions.<ref name=Wired>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/01/nissan-leaf-2/|title=In Race to Market, Nissan<U+2019>s Electric Car Takes Shortcuts|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)]]|author= Darryl Siry|date=2010-01-22|accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/ev-range-high-anxiety-normal-driving-may-cut-range-in-half/|title=EV Range High Anxiety: Normal Driving May Cut Range In Half|publisher=The Truth About Cars|author=Paul Niedermeyer|date=2009-12-18|accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref>

The American magazine ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' noted that while charger costs vary between {{USD|700}} and {{USD|1,200}}, an at-home charger and its installation cost more than {{USD|2,000}} even for simple installations.<ref name=ConsumerR/> Nissan estimates a typical charger installation costs {{USD|2,200}}. The article did not mention that home charger installations are eligible for a 50% [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#Charging Equipment|federal tax credit]] up to {{USD|2,000}}.<ref name=HC0310>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/incentives-laws/us-tax-incentives-plug-hybrids-and-electric-cars.html|title=US Tax Incentives for Plug-in Hybrids and Electric Cars|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2010-03-08|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> Consumer Reports noted that the first 5,700 Leaf buyers will get free chargers with federal support in 13 cities. The consumer group also reminded that many older houses with only a 60<U+2013>100&nbsp;amp supply may need a panel upgrade to install a 240-volt circuit, which can cost several thousand dollars.<ref name=ConsumerR>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/09/nissan-leaf-electric-car-charger-installation-cost-proves-shocking.html|title=Nissan Leaf electric-car charger installation cost proves shocking|work=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=2010-09-03|accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref> The additional 220<U+2013>240-volt charger is only required for countries (mainly the North / South American continent) that do not have a 220<U+2013>240-volt [[Mains electricity|domestic grid]] or want faster charging than under 110<U+2013>120-volt.

''Consumer Reports'' also called buyers' attention to the fact that the Leaf's total out-of-pocket costs include a {{USD|595}} acquisition fee and a {{USD|395}} disposition fee. The consumer group also emphasized that the announced lease price of {{USD|349}}-a-month applies only to buyers with good credit (Tier 1, or a [[FICO score]] of 700 or above); for those with less than optimum credit, the monthly rate would increase. They reminded buyers that the lease comes with a 23,000&nbsp;km/year (15,000-mile-per-year) allowance, but additional miles will cost extra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/09/nissan-leaf-lease-details-revealed.html|title=Nissan Leaf lease details revealed|work=[[Consumer Reports]]|date=2010-09-03|accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref>

The Leaf has been awarded by multiple organizations. Notable awards include the inclusion by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine as one of the 50 best inventions of 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934027_1934003_1933970,00.html|title=The 50 Best Inventions of 2009|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-11-13 | date=2009-11-12}}</ref> At the 2010 [[Washington Auto Show]], the Leaf was given the 2010 [[Green Car Vision Award]] by the [[Green Car Journal]] (GCJ), who noted that the Leaf "will provide the features, the styling, and the driving experience that will meet the needs of a sophisticated and demanding market, while producing zero localized emissions and requiring no petroleum fuels."<ref name=GreenAward>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencar.com/articles/nissan-leaf-electric-car-wins-2010-green-car-vision-award.php|publisher=[[Green Car Journal]]|title=Nissan Leaf Electric Car Wins 2010 Green Car Vision Award|author=Green Car Journal Editors| date=2010-01-26|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', upon awarding the Leaf its 2010 Breakthrough Award, explained that the Nissan Leaf is "not the first pure EV, but [...] hits the mainstream like none of its predecessors." ''Popular Mechanics'' also alluded to the Leaf's {{convert|100|mi|km|disp=flip}} range, which is said to be "enough for most commuters for the price of an average vehicle <U+2013> and with a much lower operating cost than gasoline-powered vehicles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Nissan-LEAF-Receives-Popular-prnews-2607695599.html?x=0&.v=1|title=Nissan LEAF Receives Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Award|publisher=[[Yahoo]] Finance|date=2010-10-05|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> Other awards received by the Leaf include the 2011 [[European Car of the Year]],<ref name=ECOTY>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/8167962/Nissan-Leaf-wins-Car-of-the-Year.html|title=Nissan Leaf wins Car of the Year |accessdate=2010-11-29|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> and being voted one of the three finalists for the 2011 [[North American Car of the Year]] award, to be announced at the 2011 [[North American International Auto Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/north-american-car-of-the-year-finalists-are-announced/?hpw|title=North American Car of the Year Finalists Are Announced|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref>
