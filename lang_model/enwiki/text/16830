'''Johnny Logan''' (born on [[13 May]] [[1954]] in [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]] near [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], real name '''Se<U+00E1>n Patrick Michael Sherrard''') is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[singer]] and [[composer]].

== Early life and Career ==

His father was an Irish [[tenor]], Patrick O'Hagen, who performed three times at The [[White House]], for [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Richard Nixon]]. The family moved back to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] when Johnny was aged three. He learned the [[guitar]] and began composing his own songs by the age of thirteen. On leaving school he apprenticed as an electrician, while performing in folk and blues clubs. His earliest claim to fame was starring as Adam in the 1977 Irish musical "Adam and Eve". <ref>[http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/johnnyloganf.htm Johnny Logan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Having adopted the stage name Johnny Logan, he released his first single in 1978 and took part in the [[National Song Contest]] in 1979. <ref>[http://www.irish-showbands.com/images/pop/johnnylogan5-78.htm Johnny Logan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.geocities.com/national_finals_70s_80s/Ireland1979.html IRISH NATIONAL FINAL 1979<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

== First Eurovision win ==

The following year, Logan entered the contest again with the Shay Healy song "[[What's Another Year]]" and won. <ref>[http://www.geocities.com/national_finals_70s_80s/Ireland1980.html IRISH NATIONAL FINAL 1980<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Representing Ireland in the Netherlands, Logan won the [[1980 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]] on April 19. <ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=296 Eurovision Song Contest 1980 | Year page | Eurovision Song Contest - Belgrade 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>The song became a hit all over Europe and reached No.1 in the UK. <ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=8792 Chart Stats - Johnny Logan - What's Another Year<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Due to a mix-up, two follow up single were released almost simultaneously; "Save Me" and "In London". With confusion by radio stations over which to play, both singles flopped. Another single released in late 1980, a cover of a recent [[Cliff Richard]] song, "Give A Little Bit More" was a more concerted effort and although it narrowly missed the chart, the momentum from Eurovision was now lost. Logan blames his lack of success in the UK on poor management and his inexperience. <ref>"Why Me" - 1992 documentary, RT<U+00C9> Television</ref>

In early 1983, Logan attempted a comeback in the UK with the song "Becoming Electric" with a new sound and image and promotional push, but was unsuccessful and again in 1986 when he rebranded himself ''Logan'' with the song "Stab In The Back".

== Second Eurovision win ==

In 1987, he decided to make another attempt at Eurovision and with his self-penned song "[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]", he represented Ireland at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|Eurovision Song Contest]] in Belgium. The song won the contest and again, Logan had a major European hit with the song and reached No.2 in the UK (although it outsold "What's Another Year"). <ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=303 Eurovision Song Contest 1987 | Year page | Eurovision Song Contest - Belgrade 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=14348 Chart Stats - Johnny Logan - Hold Me Now<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Keen to continue this success, Logan released a cover of the [[10cc]] song "[[I'm Not In Love]]", produced by [[Paul Hardcastle]] as a follow-up, and an album. Both single and album made the UK charts but were not significant enough to sustain a continued chart career. <ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=14598 Chart Stats - Johnny Logan - I'm Not In Love<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The following year, Logan released his next single, "Heartland" which became a hit in the Irish charts and from then on, concentrated on his career in Ireland and Europe. <ref>[http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement The Irish Charts - All there is to know<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Third Eurovision win ==

Having composed the Irish [[1984 Eurovision Song Contest]] entry for [[Linda Martin]], "[[Terminal 3]]" (which came 2nd), Logan repeated the collaboration in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992]] when he gave Martin another of his songs, "[[Why Me? (Linda Martin song)|Why Me]]". The song became the Irish entry at the finals in Sweden. The song took the title and cemented Logan as the most successful artist in Eurovision history with three wins. <ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=308 Eurovision Song Contest 1992 | Year page | Eurovision Song Contest - Belgrade 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in his book ''The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History'' that Logan is the only lead singer to have sung two winning entries and one of only five authors/composers (all men) to have written/composed two winning songs. <ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 ISBN 978-1-84442-994-3</ref>

He is sometimes referred to as "Mister Eurovision" by fans of the contest and the media at large. <ref>[http://www.balticsww.com/eurovision_johnny_logan.htm Johnny Logan Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Hold Me Now" has been adopted by fans of [[Bohemian FC]] as their very own "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" and is sung primarily at away games. 

"Hold Me Now" was voted as the 3rd most popular song in Eurovision history at the 50th anniversary concert in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] in October 2005. "[[What's Another Year?]]" was also nominated amongst the 14 finalists. It has sold over 3 million copies. "Hold Me Now" is also a million-seller.

== Recent career ==

Throughout his career, which spans four decades, Logan has issued no less than 40 [[single (music)|single]]s and 19 [[albums]]. He has continued his love of participating in [[musical theatre]], having toured [[Norway]] with ''Which Witch'', an [[operamusical]] originating in that country. In 2002 Logan took part in the UK TV Quiz show "[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]" as a team panelist in a Eurovision-special.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0658980/ "Never Mind the Buzzcocks" Episode #10.10 (2002)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

His performing and songwriting career continues. He also featured on the 2007 advertisement for [[McDonald's]] Eurosaver menu in Ireland, as well as having provided the song "A State of Happiness", used in the advertising campaign for [[Center Parcs]], [[The Netherlands]] in 2006.

He lives in [[Ashbourne, County Meath]], [[Ireland]].
