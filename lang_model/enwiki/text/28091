'''''Watchmen''''' is a twelve-issue [[comic book]] [[limited series]] created by writer [[Alan Moore]], artist [[Dave Gibbons]], and [[colourist]] [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]]. The series was published by [[DC Comics]] during 1986 and 1987, and has been subsequently reprinted in collected form. ''Watchmen'' originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring [[superhero]] characters that the company had acquired from [[Charlton Comics]]. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor [[Dick Giordano]] convinced the writer to create original characters instead.

Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to critique the superhero concept. ''Watchmen'' depicts an [[alternate history]] where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s, helping the United States to win the [[Vietnam War]]. The country is edging towards a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[Soviet Union]], freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement, and eventually leads them to confront a plot that would stave off nuclear war by killing millions of people.<!-- Wikipedia policy means that articles on fiction contain spoilers, so there is no reason to remove this information from the lead section. See [[Wikipedia:Spoiler]] for further information.-->

Creatively, the focus of ''Watchmen'' is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained [[smiley]]. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, a fictional pirate comic titled ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', which one of the characters reads. Structured as a [[nonlinear narrative]], the story skips through space, time and plot. ''Watchmen'' has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press, and is regarded by critics as a seminal text of the comics medium. After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' was released in 2009.

{{quote box|align=left|width=40%|quote="I suppose I was just thinking, 'That'd be a good way to start a comic book: have a famous super-hero found dead.'

In 1985, DC Comics acquired a line of characters from [[Charlton Comics]].<ref name="Giordano">Eury; Giordano, p. 124</ref> During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, as he had done in his ''[[Marvelman|Miracleman]]'' series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that [[MLJ Comics]]' [[Mighty Crusaders]] might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of [[Shield (Archie Comics)|The Shield]] in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them "so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was".<ref name="cba">Cooke, Jon B.

''The Comics Journal''. July 1987.</ref> and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor [[Dick Giordano]].<ref name="Giordano" /> Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but the editor opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters.<ref name="EW article 2">Jensen, Jeff. "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854_2,00.html Watchmen: An Oral History (2 of 6)]".

He said, "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work."<ref name="cba" />

Artist Dave Gibbons, who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects, heard the writer was working on a limited series treatment.

Both Wein and Giordano stood back and "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, "Who copyedits Alan Moore, for God's sake?"<ref name="Giordano" />

After receiving the go-ahead to work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter's house creating characters, crafting details for the story's milieu and discussing influences.<ref name="EW article 2" /> The pair was particularly influenced by a ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' parody of Superman named "[[Superduperman]]"; Moore said, "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees<U+2014>dramatic, instead of comedic".<ref name="EW article 2" /> Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take "familiar old-fashioned superheroes into a completely new realm";<ref name="Blather Moore Interview 2">Kavanagh, Barry.

Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately, but rather "did it at odd times ... spend[ing] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches."<ref name="TCJ116"/> Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw; Rorschach was his favorite to draw because "you just have to draw a hat.

== Story ==
''Watchmen'' is set in an alternate reality which closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The [[point of divergence]] occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of America is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name="Wright271">Wright, p. 271</ref> In keeping with the realism of the series, although the [[List of superheroes and villains without superpowers|costumed crimefighters]] of ''Watchmen'' are commonly called "superheroes", the only character who possesses obvious superhuman powers is Doctor Manhattan.<ref name="Wright272">Wright, p. 272</ref> The existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has increased tensions between the two nations. Eventually, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, which has led to the passage of legislation in 1977 to outlaw them. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents, and [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] continues to operate outside the law.<ref name="Reynolds106">Reynolds, p. 106</ref> 

=== Plot ===
In October 1985, [[New York City]] police are investigating the murder of Edward Blake. With the police having no leads, costumed vigilante Rorschach decides to probe further. Discovering Blake to be the face behind The Comedian, a costumed hero employed by the United States government, Rorschach believes he has discovered a plot to terminate costumed adventurers and sets about warning four of his retired comrades: Dan Dreiberg (formerly the second Nite Owl), the superpowered and emotionally detached Doctor Manhattan and his lover Laurie Juspeczyk (the second Silk Spectre), and Adrian Veidt (once the hero Ozymandias, and now a successful businessman).

After Blake's funeral, Doctor Manhattan is accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. In doing so, he throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's paranoid beliefs appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain.

Neglected in her relationship with Manhattan, and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they don their costumes and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take it upon themselves to break him out of prison.  Doctor Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars to make the case for emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Doctor Manhattan's interest in humanity.

On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach continue to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Doctor Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Adrian Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, and mails it to ''New Frontiersman'', a small, right-wing newspaper in New York. The pair then confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending Atomic war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and eventually staged Moloch's death to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Finding his logic callous and abhorrent, Dreiberg and Rorschach attempt to stop him but discover that Veidt had already enacted his plan.
	
When Doctor Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, they are confronted by mass destruction and wide scale death in New York City. Doctor Manhattan notices his abilities are limited by [[tachyon]]s emanating from the Antarctic, and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming the cessation of global hostilities and cooperation against a new threat; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing Veidt's truth from the public is in the best interests of the world to keep it united. Rorschach refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan. Rorschach tells him that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt and his actions, and Manhattan responds by vaporizing him. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks Manhattan if he did the right thing in the end. In response, Manhattan states that "Nothing ever ends" before leaving the Earth for a different galaxy. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance. Back in New York, the editor at ''New Frontiersman'' complains about having to pull a two page column about Russia due to the new political climate. He asks his assistant to find some filler material from the crank file, a collection of rejected submissions to the paper, many of which had not even been reviewed. The series ends with the young man reaching towards the pile of discarded submissions, near the top of which is Rorschach's journal.

{{Main|Characters of Watchmen}}
With ''Watchmen'', Alan Moore's intention was to create four or five "radically opposing ways" to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of "[cramming] regurgitated morals" down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, "What we wanted to do was show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws."<ref name="strange" />

'''Edward Blake / The Comedian''': One of two government-sanctioned heroes (along with Doctor Manhattan) who remains active after the Keene Act is passed in 1977 to ban superheroes. His murder, which occurs shortly before the first chapter begins, sets the plot of ''Watchmen'' in motion. The character appears throughout the story in flashbacks and aspects of his personality are revealed by other characters.<ref name="Reynolds106" /> The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]], with elements of the [[Marvel Comics]] spy character [[Nick Fury]] added. Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as "a kind of [[G. Gordon Liddy|Gordon Liddy]] character, only a much bigger, tougher guy".<ref name="cba" /> Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as "ruthless, cynical, and nihilistic, and yet capable of deeper insights than the others into the role of the costumed hero."<ref name="Reynolds106" /> Although he attempted to rape the first Silk Spectre in the 1940s, issue nine reveals that years later he fathered her daughter Laurie as part of a consensual sexual relationship.

'''Dr. Jon Osterman / Doctor Manhattan''': A superpowered being who is contracted by the United States government. Scientist Jon Osterman gained power over [[matter]] when he was caught in an "Intrinsic Field Subtractor" in 1959. Doctor Manhattan was based upon Charlton's [[Captain Atom]], who in Moore's original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat. However, the writer found he could do more with Manhattan as a "kind of a quantum super-hero" than he could have with Captain Atom.<ref name="cba" /> In contrast to other superheroes who lacked scientific exploration of their origins, Moore sought to delve into [[nuclear physics]] and [[quantum physics]] in constructing the character of Dr. Manhattan. The writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time with a linear perspective, which would influence the character's perception of human affairs. Moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', so he sought for Dr. Manhattan to retain "human habits" and to grow away from them and humanity in general.<ref name="strange" /> Gibbons had created the blue character [[Rogue Trooper]], and explained he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan as it resembles skin tonally, but has a different hue. Moore incorporated the color into the story, and Gibbons noted the rest of the comic's color scheme made Manhattan unique.<ref name=secrets>"[http://www.watchmencomicmovie.com/110308-watchmen-movie-dave-gibbons.php Watchmen Secrets Revealed]". WatchmenComicMovie.com. November 3, 2008. Retrieved on November 5, 2008.</ref> Moore recalled that he was unsure if DC would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude, which partially influenced how they portrayed the character.<ref name="TCJ116"/> Gibbons wanted to be tasteful in depicting Manhattan's nudity, selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him "understated" genitals<U+2014>like a classical sculpture<U+2014>so the reader would not initially notice it.<ref name="SeqTart"/>

'''Daniel Dreiberg / Nite Owl''': A retired superhero who utilizes owl-themed gadgets.  Nite Owl was based on the [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]] version of the [[Blue Beetle]]. Paralleling the way that Ted Kord had a predecessor, Moore also incorporated an earlier adventurer who used the name "Nite Owl," the retired crime fighter Hollis Mason, into ''Watchmen''.<ref name="cba" /> While Moore devised character notes for Gibbons to work from, the artist provided a name and a costume design for Hollis Mason he had created when he was twelve.<ref name="SeqTart">Kallies, Christy. "[http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/july99/gibbons.shtml Under the Hood: Dave Gibbons]". SequentialTart.com. July 1999.

'''Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias''': Drawing inspiration from [[Alexander the Great]], Veidt was once the superhero Ozymandias, but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises. Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet. Ozymandias was directly based on [[Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt]]; Moore liked the idea of a character who "us[ed] the full 100% of his brain" and "[had] complete physical and mental control".<ref name="cba" /> Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to "help the world", Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories, and in a sense he is the "villain" of the series.<ref name="Reynolds">Reynolds, p. 110</ref>  Gibbons noted "One of the worst of his sins [is] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity, scorning the rest of humanity."<ref>"[http://www.watchmencomicmovie.com/101608-watchmen-comic-dave-gibbons-interview.php Talking With Dave Gibbons]". WatchmenComicMovie.com. October 16, 2008. Retrieved on October 28, 2008.</ref>

'''[[Rorschach (comics)|Walter Joseph Kovacs / Rorschach]]''': A vigilante who wears a white mask that contains a symmetrical but constantly shifting ink blot pattern, he continues to fight crime in spite of his outlaw status. Moore said he was trying to "come up with this quintessential [[Steve Ditko]] character<U+2014>someone who's got a funny name, whose surname begins with a 'K,' who's got an oddly designed mask". Moore based Rorschach on Ditko's creation [[Mr. A]];<ref name="S&S116" /> Ditko's Charlton character [[Question (comics)|The Question]] also served as a template for creating Rorschach.<ref name="cba" /> Comics historian Bradford W. Wright described the character's world view "a set of black-and-white values that take many shapes but never mix into shades of gray, similar to the [[Rorschach test|ink blot tests]] of his namesake". Rorschach sees existence as random and, according to Wright, this viewpoint leaves the character "free to 'scrawl [his] own design' on a 'morally blank world'".<ref>Wright, p. 272<U+2013>73</ref> Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in him not surviving the story.<ref name="strange" />

'''Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre''': The daughter of Sally Jupiter (the first Silk Spectre, with whom she has a strained relationship), and The Comedian. She had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years. While Silk Spectre was based partially on the Charlton character [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], Moore was not impressed by the character and drew more from heroines such as [[Black Canary]] and [[Phantom Lady]].<ref name="cba" />

== Art and composition ==
Moore and Gibbons designed ''Watchmen'' to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that ''Watchmen'' was designed to be read "four or five times," with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings.<ref name="strange" /> Dave Gibbons notes that, "[a]s it progressed, ''Watchmen'' became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a [[macguffin]], a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn't the most interesting thing about ''Watchmen''. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in."<ref name="Salisbury">Salisbury, p. 82</ref>

Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of ''Watchmen'' so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and "not some other comic book".<ref name="Artists77">Salisbury, p. 77</ref> He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics.<ref name="Artists77" /> The artist tried to draw the series with "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" which he hoped "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line".<ref name="Artists80">Salisbury, p. 80</ref> In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former [[Surveying|surveyor]] for "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing".<ref>Rogers, Adam. "[http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/17-03/ff_moore_qa?currentPage=5 Legendary Comics Writer Alan Moore on Superheroes, The League, and Making Magic]." Wired.com. February 23, 2009. Retrieved on February 24, 2009.</ref> Gibbons described the series as "a comic about comics".<ref name="Pebbles116" /> Gibbons felt that "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [the presence of super-heroes] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding [[electric car]]s, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of [[fire hydrant]]s, which Moore said, "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.<ref name="TCJ116"/>

Colorist John Higgins used a template that was "moodier" and favored secondary colors.<ref name="EW article 3" /> Moore stated that he had also "always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an [[airbrush]] colorist", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color ''Watchmen'' in European-style flat color. Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes; in issue six, Higgins began with "warm and cheerful" colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling.<ref name="TCJ116"/>

=== Structure ===
[[File:WatchmenFearfulSymmetry.jpg|thumb|The middle two pages of ''Watchmen'' #5, titled "Fearful Symmetry". The whole of the issue's layout was intended to be symmetrical, culminating in this center spread, where the pages reflect one another. Art by Dave Gibbons.]]
Structurally, certain aspects of ''Watchmen'' deviated from the norm in comic books at the time, particularly the panel layout and the coloring. Instead of panels of various sizes, the creators divided each page into a nine-panel grid.<ref name="EW article 3" /> Gibbons favored the nine-panel grid system due to its "authority".<ref name="Artists80" /> Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which "gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn't had previously", according to Gibbons. "There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect."<ref name="Salisbury"/> [[Bhob Stewart]] of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' mentioned to Gibbons in 1987, that the page layouts recalled those of [[EC Comics]], in addition to the art itself, which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of [[John Severin]].<ref name="Pebbles116"/> Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the EC-style layouts "was a very deliberate thing", although his inspiration was rather [[Harvey Kurtzman]],<ref name="Comics Bulletin"/> but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look.<ref name="Pebbles116"/> The artist also cited Steve Ditko's work on early issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as an influence,<ref>Salisbury, p. 77<U+2013>80</ref> as well as ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', where "even at his most psychedelic [he] would still keep a pretty straight page layout".<ref name=illustrating/>

The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story. Gibbons said, "The cover of the ''Watchmen'' is in the real world and looks quite real, but it's starting to turn into a comic book, a portal to another dimension."<ref name="TCJ116"/> The covers were designed as close-ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present.<ref name="strange" /> The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents. Gibbons drew issue five, titled "Fearful Symmetry", so the first page mirrors the last (in terms of frame disposition), with the following pages mirroring each other before the center-spread is (broadly) symmetrical in layout.<ref name="TCJ116"/>

The end of each issue, with the exception of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various ''Watchmen'' characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of ''Watchmen'', which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory.<ref name="CBR Amaya 2008" /> Moore said, "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it."<ref name="TCJ116"/>

=== ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' ===
{{for|the direct-to-video supplement to the comic book's film adaptation|Watchmen (film)#Home media}}
''Watchmen'' features a [[story within a story]] in the form of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'', a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten and eleven. The fictional comic's story, "Marooned", is read by a youth in New York City.<ref name="Reynolds"/> Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of ''Watchmen'' experience superheroes in real life, "they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics."<ref name="Blather Moore Interview 3">Kavanagh, Barry. "[http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/watchmen3.html The Alan Moore Interview: Watchmen, microcosms and details]". Blather.net. October 17, 2000. Retrieved on October 14, 2008.</ref> Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is "a big [[Bertolt Brecht]] fan": the ''Black Freighter'' alludes to the song "[[Pirate Jenny|Seer<U+00E4>uberjenny]]" ("[[Pirate Jenny]]") from Brecht's ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]''.<ref name="TCJ116"/> Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as "objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent<U+2014>with EC riding the crest of the wave."<ref name="S&S116"/> Moore felt that "the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of ''Watchmen''".<ref name="S&S116"/> The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory.<ref>Salisbury, p. 80<U+2013>82</ref> The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of ''Tales of the Black Freighter'' at the end of issue five credits real-life artist [[Joe Orlando]] as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the ''Watchmen'' universe that DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]] might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were a page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.<ref name="S&S116"/>

In "Marooned", a young mariner (called "The Sea Captain") journeys to warn his home town of the coming of the Black Freighter, after he survives the destruction of his own ship. He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a make-shift raft. When he finally returns home, believing it to be already under the occupation of the Black Freighter's crew, he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home, mistaking her for a pirate. After realizing what he has done, he returns to the sea shore, where he finds that the Black Freighter has not come to claim the town; it has come to claim him. He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship. According to Richard Reynold, the mariner is "forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another." Just like Adrian Veidt, he "hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal".<ref>Reynolds, p. 111</ref> Moore stated that the story of ''The Black Freighter'' ends up specifically describing "the story of Adrian Veidt" and that it can also be used as a counterpoint to other parts of the story, such as Rorschach's capture and Dr. Manhattan's self-exile on Mars.<ref name="Blather Moore Interview 3" />

=== Symbols and imagery ===
Moore named [[William S. Burroughs]] as one of his main influences during the conception of ''Watchmen''. He admired Burroughs' use of "repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning" in Burroughs' only comic strip, "[[Ah Pook is Here|The Unspeakable Mr. Hart]]", which appeared in the British underground magazine ''Cyclops''. Not every intertextual link in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that "there's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read," while other "things ... turned up in there by accident."<ref name="strange" />

[[File:Galle crater.gif|left|thumb|The [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]] from the planet Mars appears in ''Watchmen'' as an example of the series' recurring [[smiley]] motif]]
A blood-stained [[smiley face]] is a recurring image in the story, appearing in many forms. In ''The System of Comics'', Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as a recurring motif that produces "rhyme and remarkable configurations" by appearing in key segments of ''Watchmen'', notably the first and last pages of the series. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a "recurrent geometric motif" and due to its symbolic connotations.<ref>Groensteen, p. 152, 155</ref> Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to "lighten" the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as "a symbol for the whole series",<ref name="Artists80" /> noting its resemblance to the [[Doomsday Clock]] ticking up to midnight.<ref name=illustrating/> Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of [[behaviorism]], explaining that the tests had presented the face as "a symbol of complete innocence". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that "the little plugs on the spark hydrants, if you turn them upside down, you discover a little smiley face".<ref name="strange" />

Other symbols, images and allusion that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that "[t]he whole thing with ''Watchmen'' has just been loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping up all over the place".<ref name="S&S116"/> Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic,<ref name="Comics Bulletin" /> citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship.<ref name="Pebbles116"/> In a book of the [[Impact crater|craters]] and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle crater]], which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, "We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the "[[Gordian Knot]] Lock Company".<ref name="S&S116"/>

== Themes ==
The initial premise for the series was to examine what superheroes would be like "in a credible, real world". As the story became more complex, Moore said ''Watchmen'' became about "power and about the idea of the superman manifest within society."<ref name="Craft">Whiston, Daniel. "[http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm The Craft]". EngineComics.co.uk. January 2005. Retrieved on October 14, 2008. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080307154513/http://www.enginecomics.co.uk/interviews/jan05/alanmoore.htm Archived] March 7, 2008 at the [[Wayback Machine]].</ref> The title of the series refers to the question "Who watches the watchmen?", although Moore said in a 1986 interview with ''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' he did not know where that sentence originated.<ref>Plowright, Frank. "Preview: Watchmen". ''Amazing Heroes''. June 15, 1986.</ref> After reading the interview, author [[Harlan Ellison]] informed Moore that the sentence is a translation of the question "[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?]]", posed by the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]]. Moore commented in 1987, "In the context of ''Watchmen'', that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them?'"<ref name="TCJ116" /> The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of ''Watchmen'' that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.<ref name="cba" />

[[File:Who Watches the Watchmen.jpg|thumb|Graffiti similar to that which appears in ''Watchmen''. Hemel Hempstead, May 2008.]]Bradford Wright described ''Watchmen'' as "Moore's obituary for the concept of heroes in general and superheroes in particular."<ref name="Wright272" /> Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of ''Watchmen'' were Moore's "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate." He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to "the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagans]], [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatchers]], and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process".<ref name="Wright273">Wright, p. 273</ref> Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing ''Watchmen'' to be "not anti-Americanism, [but] anti-[[Political positions of Ronald Reagan|Reaganism]]," specifically believing that "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable."<ref name="TCJ116"/> While Moore wanted to write about "power politics" and the "worrying" times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would "switch off" if he attacked a leader they admired.<ref name="EW article 2" /> Moore stated in 1986 that he "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy."<ref name="TCJ116"/>

Citing ''Watchmen'' as the point where the comic book medium "came of age", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay "Deconstructing the Hero" that the story accomplished this by "developing its heroes precisely in order to ''deconstruct'' the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground".<ref>Thomson, p. 101</ref> Thomson stated that the heroes in ''Watchmen'' almost all share a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook "as the simple, unvarnished truth" to "deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality".<ref>Thomson, p. 108</ref> He wrote that the story "develops its heroes precisely in order to ask us if we would not in fact be better off without heroes".<ref>Thomson, p. 109</ref> Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept "suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed", which he feels distinguishes "this postmodern work" from the deconstructions of the hero in the [[existentialism]] movement.<ref>Thomson, p. 111</ref> Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of ''Watchmen'' are forced to confront "more intangible social and moral concerns", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre.<ref>Reynolds, p. 115</ref> Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self awareness of the genre "all mark out ''Watchmen'' either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre".<ref>Reynolds, p. 117</ref>

Geoff Klock eschewed the term "deconstruction" in favor of describing ''Watchmen'' as a "revisionary superhero narrative." He considers ''Watchmen'' and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' to be "the first instances ... of [a] new kind of comic book ... a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature."<ref>Klock, p. 25<U+2013>26</ref> He elaborates by noting that "Alan Moore's realism ... performs a ''[[kenosis]]'' towards comic book history ... [which] does not ennoble and empower his characters ... Rather, it sends a wave of disruption back through superhero history ...  devalue[ing] one of the basic superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world".<ref>Klock, p. 63</ref> First and foremost, "Moore's exploration of the [often sexual] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate<U+2014>to revision<U+2014>every superhero in terms of Moore's ''kenosis''<U+2014>his emptying out of the tradition."<ref>Klock, p. 65</ref> Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself.<ref>Klock, p. 62</ref> The deconstructive nature of ''Watchmen'' is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, "[l]ike Alan Moore's ''kenosis'', [Veidt] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.'"<ref>Klock, p. 75</ref>

Moore has expressed dismay that "[t]he gritty, deconstructivist postmodern superhero comic, as exemplified by ''Watchmen'' ... became a genre". He said in 2003 that "to some degree there has been, in the 15 years since ''Watchmen'', an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these grim, pessimistic, nasty, violent stories which kind of use ''Watchmen'' to validate what are, in effect, often just some very nasty stories that don't have a lot to recommend them."<ref>Robinson, Tasha. "[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22543 Interviews: Alan Moore]". AVClub.com. June 25, 2003. Retrieved on October 15, 2008.</ref> Gibbons said that while readers "were left with the idea that it was a grim and gritty kind of thing", he said in his view the series was "a wonderful celebration of superheroes as much as anything else."<ref>Salisbury, p. 96</ref>

== Publication and reception ==
[[File:Alan Moore.jpg|thumb|[[Alan Moore]], co-creator of ''Watchmen'', severed his ties with DC Comics over contractual issues related to the work.]]
When Moore and Gibbons turned in the first issue of ''Watchmen'' to DC, their peers were stunned. Gibbons recalled, "What really clinched it ... was [writer/artist] [[Howard Chaykin]], who doesn't give praise lightly, and who came up and said, 'Dave what you've done on ''Watchmen'' is fuckin' A.'"<ref name="Duin-Gibbons">Duin, Steve and Richardson, Mike. ''Comics: Between the Panels''. Dark Horse Comics, 1998. ISBN 1-56971-344-8, p. 460<U+2013>61</ref> Speaking in 1986, Moore stated that "DC backed us all the way ... and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses."<ref name="TCJ116"/> To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained [[Smiley|smiley face]] badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold.<ref name="Pebbles116"/> Mayfair Games introduced a ''Watchmen'' module for its DC Heroes Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.<ref>Gomez, Jeffrey. "Who Watches the Watchmen?". ''Gateways''. June 1987.</ref>

''Watchmen'' was published in single-issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987. The [[limited series]] was a commercial success, and its sales helped DC Comics briefly overtake its competitor [[Marvel Comics]] in the comic book direct market.<ref name="Wright273" /> The series' publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six Len Wein believed were necessary. Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete.<ref name="CBR Amaya 2008" /> Bhob Stewart of ''The Comics Journal'' noted in Spring 1987 that issue 12, which DC solicited for April 1987, "looks like it won't debut until July or August".<ref name="S&S116"/>

After the series concluded, the individual issues were collected and sold in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] form. Along with [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 1986 ''[[The Dark Knight Returns|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' mini-series, ''Watchmen'' was marketed as a "[[graphic novel]]", a term which allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels, but dissociated them from comics.<ref>Sabin, p. 165</ref> As a result of the publicity given to the books like the ''Watchmen'' trade in 1987, bookstore and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them. Subsequently, new comics series were commissioned on the basis of reprinting them in a collected form for these markets.<ref>Sabin, p. 165<U+2013>167</ref> In 1987, Graphitti Design produced a special limited edition, slipcased hardcover volume that contained 48 pages of bonus material, including the original proposal and concept art. In 2005, DC released ''Absolute Watchmen'', an oversized slipcased hardcover edition of the series in DC's [[DC Comics Absolute Edition|Absolute Edition]] format.

''Watchmen'' received critical praise, both inside and outside of the comics industry. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which noted that the series was "by common assent the best of breed" of the new wave of comics published at the time, praised ''Watchmen'' as "a superlative feat of imagination, combining sci-fi, political satire, knowing evocations of comics past and bold reworkings of current graphic formats into a dysutopian {{sic}} mystery story."<ref>Cocks, Jay.

Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would possibly create a 12-issue prequel series called ''Minutemen'' featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story.<ref name="TCJ106"/> DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as ''Rorschach's Journal'' or ''The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary'', as well as hinting at the possibility of other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because ''[[The 'Nam]]'' was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" (in the manner of ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]''). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals.<ref name="CI65p61">"Watchmen Round Table: Moore & Gibbons". ''[[David Anthony Kraft]]'s Comics Interview''. Issue 65, 1988.</ref> Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of a ''Minutemen'' series, because it would have "[paid] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books<U+2014>with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting to see how we got to the conclusion."<ref name="Comics Bulletin" />

Disagreements about the ownership of the story ultimately led Alan Moore to sever ties with DC Comics.<ref name="NYC Itzkoff">Itzkoff, Dave.

March 12, 2006. Retrieved on October 7, 2008.</ref> Not wanting to work under a [[work for hire]] arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for ''Watchmen''. Speaking at the 1985 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Moore said "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we can make all the money from the [[Slurpee]] cups."<ref name="TCJ106" /> For ''Watchmen'', Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings.<ref name="strange" /> Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours."<ref name="TCJ116"/> Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them "a substantial amount of money" to retain the rights. Moore added, "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with."<ref name="TCJ116"/>

Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for ''Watchmen'' and his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' series with artist [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]]. Moore felt the reversion clauses were ultimately meaningless, because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print. He told ''The New York Times'' in 2006, "I said, 'Fair enough,' [...] 'You have managed to successfully swindle me, and so I will never work for you again.{{'"}}<ref name="NYC Itzkoff" /> In 2000, Moore publicly distanced himself from DC's plans for a fifteenth anniversary ''Watchmen'' hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from [[DC Direct]]. While DC wanted to mend its relationship with the writer, Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his [[America's Best Comics]] imprint (launched under the [[WildStorm]] comic imprint, which was bought by DC in 1998; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement). Moore added, "As far as I'm concerned, the 15th anniversary of Watchmen is purely a 15th Anniversary of when DC managed to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave [Gibbons]."<ref>"[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=34286 Moore Leaves the Watchmen 15th anniversary plans]".

DC Comics co-publishers [[Dan DiDio]] and [[Jim Lee]] responded, "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic characters if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves."<ref>Thill, Scott.

== Legacy ==
Since its release, ''Watchmen'' has garnered acclaim as a seminal work of the comic book medium. In ''Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History'', Robert Harvey wrote that with ''Watchmen'', Moore and Gibbons "had demonstrated as never before the capacity of the [comic book] medium to tell a sophisticated story that could be engineered only in comics".<ref name="Harvey150">Harvey, p. 150</ref> In his review of the Absolute Edition of the collection, Dave Itzkoff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the dark legacy of ''Watchmen'', "one that Moore almost certainly never intended, whose DNA is encoded in the increasingly black inks and bleak storylines that have become the essential elements of the contemporary superhero comic book," is "a domain he has largely ceded to writers and artists who share his fascination with brutality but not his interest in its consequences, his eagerness to tear down old boundaries but not his drive to find new ones."<ref>Itzkoff, Dave.

''Entertainment Weekly''. June 27/July 4, 2008.</ref> In 2009 Lydia Millet of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' contested that ''Watchmen'' was worthy of such acclaim, and wrote that while the series' "vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate", that "it's simply bizarre to assert that, as an illustrated literary narrative, it rivals in artistic merit, say, masterpieces like [[Chris Ware]]'s '[[Acme Novelty Library]]' or almost any part of the witty and brilliant work of [[Edward Gorey]]".<ref>Millet, Lydia.
