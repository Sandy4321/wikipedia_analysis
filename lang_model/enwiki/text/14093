'''''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events''''' is a {{fy|2004}} [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Brad Silberling]]. It is based on the first three novels, ''[[The Bad Beginning]]'', ''[[The Reptile Room]]'', and ''[[The Wide Window]]'', in [[Lemony Snicket]]'s book [[A Series of Unfortunate Events|series]]. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]], [[Emily Browning]], [[Liam Aiken]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Catherine O'Hara]] and [[Kara and Shelby Hoffman]], with narration by [[Jude Law]]. ''A Series of Unfortunate Events'' tells the story of Count Olaf, a mysterious theater troupe actor, who attempts to deceive three orphans over their deceased parents' fortune.

[[Nickelodeon Movies]] purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Daniel Handler]]'s book series in May 2000 and began development. [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] signed on to direct in June 2002. He hired Handler to adapt the screenplay and courted Jim Carrey for Count Olaf. Sonnenfeld eventually left over budget concerns in January 2003 and Brad Silberling took over. [[Robert Gordon (screenwriter)|Robert Gordon]] rewrote Handler's script, and [[principal photography]] started on November 2003. ''A Series of Unfortunate Events'' was entirely shot using [[sound stage]]s and [[backlot]]s at [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Downey Studios]]. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, grossed approximately $209 million worldwide, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]].

==Plot==
Inventive Violet Baudelaire, her intelligent younger brother Klaus, and their sharp-toothed, precocious baby sister Sunny are orphaned when a mysterious fire destroys their parents' mansion. Mr. Poe, in charge of the Baudelaire estate, entrusts them to their "closest relative," the obnoxious Count Olaf, who is only interested in the money Violet will inherit when she turns 18. He loses custody of the children after unsuccessfully killing them trying to stage a train accident.

Poe then sends the Baudelaires to live with their uncle, Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, a cheerfully eccentric [[herpetology|herpetologist]]. Planning a trip with the children to [[Peru]], their stay with Uncle Monty is cut short when Olaf appears in disguise as a man named Stephano, who murders Monty and frames a large and poisonous viper for the killing. As the disguised Olaf prepares to spirit the children away, Sunny reveals the snake's true gentle nature, and Olaf's plot is exposed. Poe accepts Olaf's guilt, though not his true identity. Olaf abandons his disguise and escapes.

The orphans are then sent to live in Lake Lachrymose, where their Aunt Josephine resides in a house perched precariously on the edge of a cliff overlooking the waters of the vast lake. She has numerous irrational fears, and yet lives in a house populated with many of those things of which she is terrified by - her fear of realtors prevents her from moving. A room of photographs and documents apparently contains clues to the cause of the fire that killed the orphans' parents. However, Olaf arrives once again, disguised as a sailor named Captain Sham, and quickly gains Josephine's confidence. A hurricane comes to Lake Lachrymose, and Olaf regains custody of the children after rescuing them and leaving Josephine to be eaten alive by deadly leeches. 

Olaf concocts his final plan involving a [[play (theatre)|play]] starring himself and Violet. In the play, his character marries Violet's character, but in such a way that the staged marriage is legal, gaining him access to her inheritance. This move is accomplished by Olaf's casting of Justice Strauss, as the supposed judge in the play; with her in this role, the marriage is technically legal. To ensure Violet's co-operation, he holds Sunny hostage. However, Klaus succeeds by incinerating Olaf's marriage certificate when he triumphantly climbs to a nearby tower, using the same light-focusing apparatus that Olaf used to set fire to the Baudelaire mansion. Olaf is arrested, but subsequently escapes. At the ruins of the Baudelaires mansion, the three orphans find a letter left to them by their parents before the Baudelaires became orphans, which contains words of hope and encouragement. The envelope also contains a spyglass, one of several that Klaus signifies to imply the presence of a secret society his parents and relatives belonged. The orphans are then sent to new "fortunate" guardians.

The film suffered setbacks in development in December 2002. Rudin left ''Unfortunate Events'' over budget concerns.

===Filming===
Filming was set to begin in October 2003, but it was pushed back.<ref name="direct"/> [[Principal photography]] for ''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'' began on November 10, 2003,<ref name="rubber">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,679412,00.html |title=Movie Preview: Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=August 10, 2004 |accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> using the [[sound stage]]s and [[backlot]] at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or [[chroma key]] effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount backlot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount,<ref name=woe/> production then moved to [[Downey Studios]], a former [[NASA]] facility,<ref>{{cite news|first=Marc |last=Graser |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117908190 |title='Burbs blossom on H'w'd backlots |date=July 25, 2004 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with [[forced perspective]] scenery, as well as a newly-constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Domocles Dock and Curdled Cave.<ref name=woe/> Filming for ''A Series of Unfortunate Events'' ended on May 29, 2004.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892463 |title=Just ticket for ''Snicket'' |date=September 13, 2003 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:ForcedMatte.jpg|thumb|325px|left|alt=The character Count Olaf, played by Jim Carrey, sports an idyllic top hat and black-striped overcoat, seen from his thighs and up.  Behind him shows a bleak cornfield on the left and a gas station on the right.  The station has a red- and white-striped awning and looks worn.   Olaf faces to the driver's side window of a car, and he positions his right hand as if he's pointing at something above him, while concentrating his eyes on the window and holding car keys in his left hand.|Some scenery was designed to accustom [[forced perspective]] techniques, combined with [[matte painting]]s.]]

Silberling, production designer [[Rick Heinrichs]] and costume designer [[Colleen Atwood]] all aimed for the film's setting to be ambiguous, giving it a "timeless" feel. Heinrichs also added [[steampunk]] designs to the period.<ref name=woe>''A Woeful World'', 2005, Paramount DVD</ref>  To contribute to the setting, Silberling hired [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] as the cinematographer because he was impressed with the trio's work on ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.<ref name="ASC">{{cite news|first=David E. |last=Williams |title=A Darker Side of Fantasy |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/dec04/lemony/index.html |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref>

Lubezki compared the cinematic similarities to ''Sleepy Hollow'', notably the [[monochrome|monochromatic]] look of both films. He also choose a specific color palette backdrop for ''A Series of Unfortunate Events''. "The story is very episodic, so we picked a different color scheme for each section. For example," Lubezki continued, "Count Olaf<U+2019>s house has a lot of greens, blacks and grays; the house of Uncle Monty has a lot of greens and browns and a bit of yellow; and the house of Aunt Josephine has blues and blacks."<ref name="ASC"/> The railroad crossing set was constructed on a [[cyclorama]], which was the most ambitious setpiece for the art department on using elements of "in house" special effects and matte paintings.<ref name=woe/>

[[Robert D. Yeoman]] replaced Lubezski as cinematographer when Lubezski had to leave the production to commit to ''[[The New World]]''. Yeoman mostly worked on the expansive harbor set at Downey.<ref name="ASC"/> The art direction was inspired by ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'', which also influenced Handler for the writing of his books.<ref name="re"/> Atwood commented that the Mr. Poe character was based on [[Edward Gorey]] paintings.<ref>{{cite video|people=Colleen Atwood, Timothy Spall |title=Costumes and Other Suspicious Disguises |year2=2005 |publisher=Paramount |format=DVD}}</ref>

===Visual effects===
[[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), supervised by [[Stefen Fangmeier]],<ref name="ASC"/> created the film's 505 visual effects-shots.<ref name=VFX/> The filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible,<ref name="ASC"/> though the train and smoke for the railroad crossing scene was entirely created using computer animation. ILM also used [[color grading]] techniques for the Lake Lachrymose scene, which required complete animation for the leeches. The digital animators studied footage of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]] to accurately depict Hurricane Herman, which was ILM's most ambitious use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) for the film.<ref name=VFX>{{cite video|title=Trains, Leeches & Hurricanes |year2=2005 |publisher=Paramount |format=DVD}}</ref>

[[Nexus Productions]] designed the opening "Littlest Elf" animated sequence by modeling it after [[stop motion]] animation and completing it with computer animation.<ref name="rubber"/> The snakes at Uncle Monty's house were a combination of real snakes and [[animatronics]]. The animatronics, primarily the Incredibly Deadly Viper, were used as reference models that ILM later enhanced using CGI.<ref name=woe/>

Because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film, four scenes involving Sunny Baudelaire required CGI with [[motion capture]] technology.<ref name="even">{{cite video|title=An Even More Alarming Conspiracy Involving Sunny |year2=2005 |publisher=Paramount |format=DVD}}</ref> Among these are the shot of Sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth, catching a spindle with her mouth and the scene where she is entangled with the Incredibly Deadly Viper. Animation supervisor Colin Brady used his baby daughter for [[motion capture]] recording.<ref name="even"/> A remote controlled animatronic of Sunny was also designed by [[Kevin Yagher]].<ref>{{cite video|title=An Alarming Conspiracy Involving Sunny |year2=2005 |publisher=Paramount |format=DVD}}</ref>

[[Ty Burr]], writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', observed, "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a [[Tim Burton]] movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], and ''Snicket'' has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're in the hands of people who know what they're doing.

How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket [[Happy Meal]]s. Yet."<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Ty Burr |first=Ty |last=Burr |url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=6976 |title=Artful direction makes ''Snicket'' a most fortunate event |date=April 17, 2004 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref>

Internet reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] felt that "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. ''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'' manages to remain witty throughout."<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=James Berardinelli |first=James |last=Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/l/lemony_snicket.html |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |work=ReelViews |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave a mixed review: "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', the best superhero movie ever made."<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041216/REVIEWS/41130004/1023 |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |date=April 17, 2004 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref> Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, "''A Series of Unfortunate Events'' suggests what ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime production designer Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] (Burton's ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'') contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes."<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Foundas |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925724.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |date=December 10, 2004 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref>

===Awards===
Makeup designer Valli O'Reilly and Bill Corso won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]]. Production designer [[Rick Heinrichs]] and set decorator Cheryl Carasik ([[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Art Direction]]), [[Colleen Atwood]] ([[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Costume Design]]) and composer [[Thomas Newman]] ([[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score|Original Music Score]]) were also nominated for their work at [[77th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1239426524794 |title=1994 (77) Academy Awards |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref> The film lost the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]] to ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', but was honored for its DVD special edition release. O'Reilly and Corso were also nominated the [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up]], but lost to ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |title=Past Saturn Awards |work=Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films |accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref>

==Planned franchise==
[[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]] hoped the film would become a franchise like the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref name="franchise"/> Jim Carrey was attracted to the film because he found it to be a good recurring franchise character that would still allow him each time to dive into a new role.<ref name="re"/> "I don't have a deal [for a sequel], but it's one that I wouldn't mind doing again because there are so many characters," the actor explained in December 2004. "I mean, it's just so much fun. It's so much fun being a bad actor playing a character..."<ref name="seq"/> In May 2005, producer [[Laurie MacDonald]] said "''Lemony Snicket'' is still something Paramount is interested in pursuing and we're going to be talking with them more."<ref>{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Otto |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/618/618877p1.html |title=Producers Talk Ring 3 and Snicket Sequel |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 25, 2005 |accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> In an October 2008 interview, Daniel Handler said that "a sequel does seem to be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few corporate shakeups, widely documented in articles I find too stupefying to finish, which has led to many a delay. Of course many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps."<ref>{{cite news|first=Ronnie |last=Scott |url=http://bookslut.com/features/2008_10_013548.php |title=An Interview With Daniel Handler |work=BookSlut.com |date=October 2008 |accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a [[stop motion]] film because the lead actors have grown too old. "In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now I'm afraid I<U+2019>m going to have to show you the real thing.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/06/03/lemony-snicket-director-brad-silberling-plans-to-do-each-film-in-different-medium/ |first=Eric |last=Ditzian |title=''Lemony Snicket'' Director Brad Silberling Plans To Do Each Film In Different Medium |work=[[MTV News]] |date=June 3, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2009}}</ref>
