The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] '''Siwanoy''' or '''Sinanoy''' were a band of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] people, the [[Wappinger]], in what is now the [[New York City]] area.  By the mid-17th century, when their territory became hotly contested between [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] and [[English colonial empire|English colonial]] interests, the Siwanoy were settled along the [[East River]] and [[Long Island Sound]] between [[Hell Gate]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]], a territory that included eastern parts of what became [[the Bronx]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] in [[New York]] and southwestern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] in [[Connecticut]].

==History==
The first European settler to the territory was [[Jonas Bronck]], who had arrived in [[New Netherland]] in 1639, and negotiated the purchase of 254 acres of land along the [[Harlem River]] in what is today's [[Mott Haven]].

They are known for their massacre of [[Anne Hutchinson]] and her family during [[Kieft's War]] in 1643.
In August 1643, a group of Siwanoy led by the [[sachem]] [[Chief Wampage|Wampage]] massacred Hutchinson's household of 16 people near [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], an ancient landmark.  The only survivor was Hutchinson's nine-year old daughter, [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]], who may have been spared because of her red hair.  The attack was in revenge for [[New Netherland]] governor [[Willem Kieft]]'s February massacres of Wappinger [[refugees]] from [[Wecquaesgeek]] at Corlaer's Hook and [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]. Like thousands of American Indians and numerous colonists, Hutchinson became caught up in the bloody reprisals which characterized the two year conflict. The Siwanoy attack killed Hutchinson, six of her children, and nine others.<ref name="Shorto">p. 160 of: {{cite book

On June 27, 1654, [[Thomas Pell]], a [[Connecticut]] physician, obtained title to a large amount of Siwanoy territory in New York through a treaty with a number of sachems, including Wampage. This included [[the Pelham Islands]] and parts of the mainland Bronx and coastal Westchester.  New Netherland authorities did not recognize his title.  They accused the [[New England]]ers of continued encroachment upon Dutch territory.  Pell's coup turned out to be decisive in New York history.  A militia of his colonists from [[City Island, Bronx|Minneford Island]] (present-day City Island) supported the [[Royal Navy|English naval]] invasion force that conquered [[New Amsterdam]] in 1664.
