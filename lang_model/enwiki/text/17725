"'''Treehouse of Horror XXII'''" is the third episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]] and the twenty-second [[Halloween]] episode of the animated comedy series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 30, 2011. The episode is part of the ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' series, which is an episode divided into three separate stories and an opening that is a parody of scary or Halloween themed stories. This episode's stories were primarily spoofs of the French film ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', the television series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', and the American film ''[[Avatar]]''. The opening was a parody of the autobiographical film ''[[127 Hours]]'', in which the subject Aron Ralston loses an arm.

The episode was written by [[Carolyn Omine]], directed by [[Matthew Faughnan]], and featured guest voices from [[Aron Ralston]] and [[Jackie Mason]]. In its original American broadcast, it was viewed by approximately 8.1 million people. The critical reception was very diverse, ranging from a plea to end the show to stating that the show is on top of its game and should not be cancelled. The episode featured a reference to the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. After watching the show, the producers of the musical released a press statement, in which they told how flattered they were when they show was mentioned on ''The Simpsons''.

==Plot==
===Opening===
When [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] come home from [[trick or treat]]ing, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] switches out the candy with vegetables and asks [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls to the bottom of the canyon with his arm pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out of reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had stolen back their candy in secret.

===The Diving Bell and the Butterball===
Homer begins to decorate the house for Halloween and is a reaching for decorations in a box. Unfortunately, there is a real [[Black Widow spider]] in the box and when Homer is grabbing for what he thinks is a plastic spider, he gets bitten by the spider. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and Homer is unable to move or talk. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through [[flatulence]].  Homer's communication by way of flatulence is strikingly reminiscent of [[Hector Salamanca]]'s use of a desk bell as a means of conveying information in the popular AMC program Breaking Bad. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by a another spider (a radioactive one), he spontaneously gains the ability to make spider webs and have the same abilities as [[Spider-Man]], even when still paralyzed.

===Dial D for Diddly===
After hearing who he thinks is God tell him to murder people, [[Ned Flanders]] becomes a [[serial killer|serial killing]] vigilante, targeting characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer is the one who has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and burns the radio receiver, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells him that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is having sex with Ned's deceased wife, [[Maude Flanders|Maude]].

===In the Na'Vi===
In the future, [[Krusty the Clown]] is still alive, but has trouble entertaining his [[Nazi]] audience. On the distant planet Rigel Seven there is a sacred extract called Hilarrium, which causes people to get in a better mood. Krusty desperately needs this sacred extract and uses military force to obtain it. The military recruits Bart and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] to befriend the alien race in [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] bodies. They succeed in this and Bart ends up getting [[Kang and Kodos|Kang]]'s daughter [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. It turns out that the extract Hilarrium, which is excreted by their queen, is primarily used by the natives to reduce the mood swings from pregnant women and Bart and Milhouse are shown where the alien race gets it from. Milhouse then reveals the location of the extract to the military, which then attacks the natives. In the battle, the natives are helped by all the animals of the planet, which eventually defeats the military. Kang and Kodos then admit that they would have just given the Hilarrium to the humans.

In the end, Lisa tells the audience that Halloween is over and that the people need to start Christmas shopping.

The episode marks the first time of all the ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes that an actual [[theramin]] was used for music cues. Previously, the show had trouble locating a theramin player, who could work under the time constraints of the show. Instead, the show used a [[synthesizer]] keyboard to play a theramin sample - much to creator [[Matt Groening]]'s displeasure.<ref name=Ledesma />  The situation turned when a scene in "[[Homer Scissorhands]]" was written to feature Milhouse playing the theramin. Now the crew had to find a suitable theramin player and Charles Richard Lester was hired for that episode as well as "Treehouse of Horror XXII".<ref name=Ledesma>{{cite web|last=Ledesma|first=Chris|title=Starting <U+201C>The Man In the Blue Flannel Pants<U+201D>|url=http://simpsonsmusic500.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/starting-the-man-in-the-blue-flannel-pants/|work=Simpsons Music 500|accessdate=November 5, 2011|date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> 

The opening segment had many parodies and references to films. When the segment opens, the [[Simpson family]] is dressed up for Halloween.

The last two segments were also parodies of [[popular culture]].

==Release==
===Broadcast===
"Treehouse of Horror XXII" originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 30, 2011, the night before [[Halloween]]. The release date was unusual for a ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode, because ever since Fox got the rights to the [[Major League Baseball]] playoffs, most of the Halloween specials aired in the first week of November. This only marks the second time Fox has aired a ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode in October since 1999 - in 2009 it aired nearly two weeks before Halloween.<ref>{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title=The Simpsons celebrates Halloween in a timely fashion for once|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-simpsons-celebrates-halloween-in-a-timely-fash,64213/|work=[[The A.V.

When [[The Wrap]] asked show runner [[Al Jean]] if he was satisfied with the airing the night before Halloween, Jean said: "Yes, and the perfect thing is, Halloween is actually a bad day to air it, because nobody watches TV that night. Especially if they have kids. So October 30th, it is our Halloween. People can watch it and then still go out the next night."<ref name="Jean">{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kimberly|title='The Simpsons' Halloween: Al Jean on Farting Homer, a 'Dexter' Spoof and Aron Ralston|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/28/idUS57925920520111028|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=October 31, 2011|date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Since airing, "Treehouse of Horror XXII" has received mixed from critics. Josh Harrison of [[Ology]] was positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections."<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Josh|title='The Simpsons' Recap: "Treehouse Of Horror XXII"|url=http://ology.com/tv/simpsons-recap-treehouse-horror-xxii|work=[[Ology]]|accessdate=November 2, 2011|date=October 30, 2011}}</ref>  At [[The A.V. Club]], Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly."<ref name="clubreview">{{cite news |last=Childs |first=Hayden |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/treehouse-of-horror-xxii,64214/ |title=The Simpsons, "Treehouse of Horror XXII" |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=October 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Meredith Woerner of [[io9]] though that "[t]he whole thing never quite achieved the same level of brilliance as some previous years <U+2014> even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster."<ref name=io9>{{cite web|last=Woerner|first=Meredith|title=The Absolute Best Scenes from The Simpsons Treehouse of Terror XXIII!|url=http://io9.com/5855051/the-absolute-best-scenes-from-the-simpsons-treehouse-of-terror-xxiii|work=[[io9]]|accessdate=October 31, 2011|date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Even more critical was [[CraveOnline]]'s Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" and further said that "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be."<ref name=Crave>{{cite web|last=Marnell|first=Blair|title=The Simpsons 23.03 'Treehouse of Horror XXII'|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/reviews/177235-the-simpsons-2303-treehouse-of-horror-xxii|work=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=November 1, 2011|date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in [[Calgary Herald]] and concluded that we should "[f]orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet."<ref>{{cite web|last=Strachan|first=Alex|title=It's trick or Treehouse time|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/trick+Treehouse+time/5629290/story.html|work=[[Calgary Herald]]|accessdate=November 5, 2011|date=October 30, 2011}}</ref> 

The first segment, "The Diving Bell and the Butterball", was met with mixed reactions. Marnell called the parody "wildly unfunny", while Childs was critical of Homer turning into a paralyzed Spider-Man and stated that it was "simply not very funny."<ref name=clubreview /> Tim Surette of [[TV.com]] was more ambivalent and said: "I found this sketch to be simultaneously awesome and terrible because I have the maturity of a 6-year old and the intelligence of an average man."<ref name=TV.com /> The reference to the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' was noticed by the producers of the musical. They  reacted by issuing a statement the following day: "Everyone at 'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' was extremely flattered by last night<U+2019>s tribute on 'The Simpsons.' 'The Simpsons' is an iconic American institution, and being part of last night's episode was an honor and dream come true."<ref name="LA Times">{{cite web|last=Ng|first=David|title='Simpsons' parodies Broadway's 'Spider-Man' in Halloween episode|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/10/the-simpsons-parodies-broadway-spider-man-in-halloween-episode.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 31, 2011|date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> Co-incidentally, the previous aired episode of ''[[South Park]]'', "[[Broadway Bro Down]]", also had a reference to the musical. Contrary to ''The Simpsons'', the spokesperson for the Broadway show did not want to comment on that episode.<ref name="LA Times" /> 

The response for "Dial D for Diddly" was that it started well, but then gradually declined. In Marnell's opinion, "[t]he best segment of the entire episode comes when Ned makes his normal routine look sinister and yet when he finally closes his hands to pray, he's actually holding a pair of severed hands", but as for the rest of the segment, he is disappointed: "[W]hen it seems like the short is heading for some darkly hilarious territory, the voice of God turns out to be Homer urging Ned to murder his enemies."<ref name=Crave /> Other reviewers agreed with his assessment. Surette concluded that the episode "[s]tarted off good, but got boring very quick."<ref name=TV.com /> Likewise, Childs commented that the "segment had a lot of promise for the funny, but it started to sag fast and then sank altogether."<ref name=clubreview /> 

Much of the criticism towards the Avatar spoof "In the Na'Vi" goes towards the timing of the episode. Surette thought that it was "[a]n Avatar spoof that came about two years too late. This sketch had no redeeming qualities and should be erased from the minds of all Simpsons fans immediately."<ref name=TV.com /> Similarly, Marnell commented that in the episode "The Simpsons' finally gets around to parodying 'Avatar' <U+2014> a movie picked to death by 'South Park' and other series a year or two ago" and further elaborated that "[i]t's almost a straight forward retelling of 'Avatar' without the biting satire that made the film parodies of previous years so much fun."<ref name=Crave /> In general, ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes take about a year to complete for the staff. This is because they have to do many original designs, such as characters and backgrounds. Prior to the airing of the episode, Jean revealed that the staff was already working on "Treehouse of Horror XXIII".<ref name=Jean />
