'''Wood End''' is an old [[Pit village|mining village]] in North [[Warwickshire]], England. It lies to the south east of [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and close to the border with [[Staffordshire]]. It grew around the former [[Kingsbury Colliery]] but now it serves as a commuter village to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. It has a church, a primary school, a co-operative store, a [[working men's club]] and a village hall. The population of Wood End is 2,205.

==History==
The land on which the village was built consisted of fields belonging to two small farms, Delves Farm and Poplars Farm, both of which exist today. There were two woods, Edge Hill Wood and Smith's Wood, but only the former survives today.  There was also a small settlement of several houses called Edge Hill, and a United Free Methodist Chapel, which closed in the late 1970s.

The first houses were built in 1890 to house workers for [[Kingsbury Colliery]], which opened in 1897. A working men's club opened in 1905, and still remains open in the original building (2011). Wood End became a village in 1906 with the opening of the parish church, [[St Michael & All Angels Church, Wood End|St Michael & All Angels Church]]. A village hall was later built in the 1960s. Also added to the housing stock was Glenville Avenue and Delves Crescent, which were council housing. In the late 1970s Birchfield close was constructed for private housing, and the village was expanded in 1985 when a new estate, Pinewood Avenue, was built to the west. A small school, [[Wood End Primary School]], was opened in 1911. The original school building no longer exists. In 1995 the school was expanded. On 13 August 1998 the older part of the school burnt down, but it has since been rebuilt.<ref>[http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/corporate/commarch.nsf/7b9d777ab230247680256acc003b3e88/80256aa7004ea8a1802566ab0048a408/$FILE/ATTMASM7/RES12.PDF Information On School Fire]</ref>

During the village's expansion over the years, parts of the village, such as Glenville Avenue (laid out during the 1950s), steadily ate into the surrounding woodland. Much of the village dates from the 1980s, with the old housing being demolished and replaced.

The older housing stock remains on one side of Wood Street, on the Working Mens Club side of Tamworth road (at the top of Wood Street), on Johnson Street, and on part of Smith Street. The most recent addition to the residential area is Meadow View, completed in 2005, which was built on scrub land previously occupied by [[Prefabricated building|prefabs]].

== Geography ==
===Geology and topography===
The village is {{convert|110|m}} above sea level and is situated on a small hill. The Warwickshire Coal Field underlies the village. Adjacent to Wood End is Kingsbury Wood, which is semi-ancient woodland in parts, part of the former [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]]. Kingsbury Wood has been designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. It is owned by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Mining tracks used to run through Kingsbury Wood, of which there is still evidence.

A small stream arises in Wood End, next to Glenville Avenue, and flows through the centre of the oldest part of the wood into Kingsbury village and eventually outflows into the [[River Tame, West Midlands|River Tame]]. At the lower end of Tamworth Road there is a small freight line, previously serving the mines at [[Dordon]] and [[Baxterley]], but which now serves the Birch Coppice Business Park in [[Dordon]].

===Boundaries===
The boundaries of Wood End are diamond-shaped, with the northern point at Edge Hill and the southern point at Glenville Avenue. To the northwest is Edge Hill Wood, to the north east are the fields of Delves Farm, and to the south is Poplars Farm. Wood End is {{convert|28|ha|acre|1}} in area. The original boundaries ran along Johnson Road and the ends of Smith Street and Wood Street, and enclosed {{convert|5.3|ha|acre|1}}.
