'''''The Outlaw Josey Wales''''' is a 1976 American [[revisionist Western]] film set during and after the [[American Civil War]]. It was directed by and starred [[Clint Eastwood]] (as the eponymous [[Josey Wales (gunfighter)|Josey Wales]]), with [[Chief Dan George]], [[Sondra Locke]], [[Sam Bottoms]], and [[Geraldine Keams]].<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; June 30, 1976.</ref>

The film was adapted by Sonia Chernus and [[Philip Kaufman]] from author [[Asa Earl Carter|Forrest Carter]]'s 1973 novel ''The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales'' (republished, as shown in the movie's opening credits, as ''Gone to Texas''). In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

==Plot==
[[Josey Wales (gunfighter)|Josey Wales]], a [[Missouri]] farmer, is driven to revenge by the murder of his wife and son by a band of pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Jayhawker]]s <U+2014> [[James H. Lane (politician)|Senator James H. Lane]]'s Redlegs from [[Kansas]].

Wales joins a group of pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Missouri [[Bushwhacker]]s led by [[William T. Anderson]]. At the conclusion of the war, Captain Fletcher persuades the guerrillas to surrender, saying they have been granted amnesty. Wales refuses to surrender. As a result, he and one young man are the only survivors when Captain Terrill's Redlegs massacre the surrendering men. Wales intervenes and guns down several Redlegs with a [[Gatling gun]]. 

Senator Lane puts a $5,000 bounty on Wales, who is now on the run from Union militia and bounty hunters. Along the way, despite wishing to be left alone, he accumulates a diverse group of companions. They include an old [[Cherokee]] named Lone Watie, a young [[Navajo people|Navajo]] woman, and an elderly woman from Kansas and her granddaughter Wales rescued from [[Comanchero]]s.

In Texas, Wales and his companions are cornered in a ranch house which is fortified to withstand Indian raids. The Redlegs attack but are gunned down by the defenders. Wales, despite being out of ammunition, pursues the fleeing Captain Terrill on horseback. When he catches him, Wales [[dry fire]]s his pistols through all twenty<U+2013>four empty chambers before stabbing Terrill with his own cavalry sword.

At the bar in Santa Rio, a wounded Wales finds Fletcher with two Texas Rangers. The locals at the bar, who refer to Wales as "Mr. Wilson," tell the Rangers that Wales was killed in a shoot-out in Monterrey, Mexico. The Rangers accept this story and move on. Fletcher refuses to believe that Wales is dead. He says that he will go to Mexico and look for Wales himself. Seeing the blood dripping on Wales's boot, Fletcher says that he will give Wales the first move, because he "owes him that." Wales rides off.

==Production==
[[File:Pahreah (Paria) Town Site, Utah1.jpg|thumb|right|Pahreah site in Utah, filming location of the film.]]
''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was inspired by a 1972 novel by [[Forrest Carter]], originally titled ''The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales'' and later retitled ''Gone to Texas''. The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer Bob Daley at Malpaso and Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights.<ref name="McGilligan257">McGilligan (1999), p. 257</ref> [[Michael Cimino]] and [[Philip Kaufman]] later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible and retained many of the mannerisms in Wales's character which Eastwood would display on screen, such as his distinctive lingo with words like "reckon", "hoss" (instead of "horse") and "ye" (instead of "you") and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims.<ref name="McGilligan257"/> The characters of Wales, the [[Cherokee]] chief, [[Navajo people|Navajo]] squaw and the old settler woman and her daughter all appeared in the novel.<ref name="McGilligan258">McGilligan (1999), p.258</ref>

Cinematographer [[Bruce Surtees]], [[James Fargo]], and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Oroville, California]] even before they saw the final script.<ref name="McGilligan258"/> Kaufman cast [[Chief Dan George]], who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Supporting Actor in ''[[Little_Big_Man_(film)|Little Big Man]]'' as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. [[Sondra Locke]], also a previous Academy Award nominee was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman's wishes,<ref name="McGilligan261">McGilligan (1999), p.261</ref> as the granddaughter of the old settler woman, Laura Lee. This marked the beginning of a close relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would last six films and the beginning of a romance that would last into the late 1980s. The film also featured his real-life seven-year old son [[Kyle Eastwood]], with [[Ferris Webster]] hired as editor and [[Jerry Fielding]] as musical composer. 

Principal photography began in mid-October 1975.<ref name="McGilligan261">McGilligan (1999), p. 261</ref> A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regards to their emerging relationship.<ref name="McGilligan262">McGilligan (1999), p. 262</ref> One evening Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene but whilst he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away, leaving Kaufman before he had returned.<ref name="McGilligan263">McGilligan (1999), p. 263</ref> Soon after filming moved to [[Kanab]], Utah. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.<ref name="McGilligan264">McGilligan (1999), p. 264</ref> The sacking caused an outrage amongst the [[Directors Guild of America]] and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production.<ref name="McGilligan264"/> Pressure mounted on Warner Brothers and Eastwood to back down, but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation.<ref name="McGilligan264"/> This resulted in the Director's Guild passing new legislation, known as 'the Clint Eastwood Rule' in which they reserved the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging a director and replacing that director with himself.<ref name="McGilligan264"/> From then on the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second in command, but with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team were able to finish making the film efficiently.

Upon release in August 1976, ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was widely acclaimed by critics. Many critics and viewers saw Eastwood's role as an iconic one, relating it with much of America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.<ref name="McGilligan266">McGilligan (1999), p.266</ref> The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] in a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''. Academics such as Bruce Jackson, critics such as [[Jay Cocks]] and [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] and directors such as [[King Vidor]], Henry King, [[William Wyler]] and [[Howard Hawks]] were invited to the screening.<ref name="McGilligan266"/> The film would later appear in ''Time'' magazine's Top 10 films of the year.<ref name="McGilligan267">McGilligan (1999), p.267</ref> Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his "[[Man with No Name]]" character in the [[Dollars Trilogy]] and praised the atmosphere of the film.
The film is seen by many as a Western masterpiece and has been awarded a 97% rating on the critical website Rotten Tomatoes.

''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]]. In 1996, it was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.

Clint Eastwood says on the 1999 DVD release that the movie is "certainly one of the high points of my career... in the Western genre of filmmaking."

==Meaning==
Eastwood has called ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' an [[anti-war film]].<ref name=WSJ>Judge, Michael (2011-01-29) [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703293204576106080298279672.html?KEYWORDS=clint+eastwood A Hollywood Icon Lays Down the Law], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he said:

<blockquote>
As for Josey Wales, I saw the parallels to the modern day at that time. Everybody gets tired of it, but it never ends. A war is a horrible thing, but it's also a unifier of countries. . . . Man becomes his most creative during war. Look at the amount of weaponry that was made in four short years of [[World War II]]<U+2014>the amount of ships and guns and tanks and inventions and planes and [[P-38]]s and [[P-51]]s, and just the urgency and the camaraderie, and the unifying. But that's kind of a sad statement on mankind, if that's what it takes.<ref name=WSJ/></blockquote>

==Historical basis==
Josey Wales' circumstances somewhat mirror those of a notorious [[bushwhacker]] named Bill Wilson, a folk hero in [[Phelps County, Missouri|Phelps]] and [[Maries County, Missouri|Maries]] counties in Missouri. During the war, loyalties in Missouri were divided. Bill Wilson maintained a neutral stance until a confrontation with Union soldiers on his farm on Corn Creek near [[Edgar Springs, Missouri]]. Wilson  became a wanted outlaw before leaving for Texas.<ref>Nichols, Bruce, "Bill Wilson of Phelps County in 1864," Historian's Missouri Civil War message board posting of sources</ref><!-- This assertion requires a better source. -->

The character Fletcher is loosely based on Capt. Dave Poole, one of [[Quantrill's Raiders]]. After the war, Poole assisted Federal authorities in convincing guerrillas to give up the fight and surrender.

This film is the first to confront the history of the Missourians who fell prey to Kansas-based Unionists who called themselves Redlegs (after their red-striped stockings and gaiters) and [[Jayhawker]]s.<ref>Shelby Foote, ''Civil War'', 1986; Paul I. Wellman, et al. ''A Dynasty of Western Outlaws''. University of Nebraska Press, 1986.</ref> It is a revisionist film in that it abandons the standard presentations of the Unionists that characterized Hollywood productions up to that time, along with the dark depictions of the Missouri riders.<ref>cf. ''Dark Command'', with [[Walter Pidgeon]] as William Quantrill and [[John Wayne]] as the "white knight" Unionist from Texas working to protect that hotbed of [[Jayhawker]] activity, Lawrence, Kansas: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032383/</ref> ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' reverses these stereotypes.

==Legacy==
[[Phish]] named an instrumental song as ''[[The Inlaw Josie Wales]]'' in their album [[Farmhouse (album)|Farmhouse]].
