'''Shamrock Rovers Football Club''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Cumann Peile Ruagair<U+00ED> na Seamr<U+00F3>ige'')  is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club in [[Dublin]] that plays in the [[Football League of Ireland]]. The club's colours are green and white hoops and they are known as The Hoops or Rovers. Shamrock Rovers originally played in green and white stripes. The green and white hooped jerseys were adopted after [[Belfast Celtic]] donated a set of their hooped jersies to Shamrock Rovers in the 1920s.
  
==History==
{{dablink|For further details on this topic, see: [[History of Shamrock Rovers F.C.]]}}
The club, founded in  [[1901]](though some sources suggest the club was founded in [[1899]]),originally hails from the inner Dublin suburb of [[Ringsend]]. From the early 1920s until [[1987]] they played at [[Glenmalure Park]], [[Milltown, Dublin|Milltown]] and became Ireland's most successful club. Shamrock Rovers have won more [[FAI Cup]]s (24) and leagues (15) than any other Irish club. For many years, Rovers were Ireland's most prestigious team. Famous achievements included the winning of six FAI Cups in a row in the 1960s and four consecutive league titles (including three "doubles") in the 1980s. In addition, they were also the first Irish club to play in the [[European Cup]], playing [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[1958]].  Further, the Shamrock Rovers were one of the European club teams which spent the 1967 season in the United States founding the [[North American Soccer League]], representing [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] as the [[Boston Beacons|Boston Rovers]]. 
Shamrock Rovers have also supplied more different players to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] (62 in all) than any other single club.  Famous players to have played for the club include: [[Jimmy Dunne]], [[Paddy Coad]], [[Jackie Jameson]], [[Frank O'Neill]], [[John Giles]], [[Mick Leech]], [[Pat Dunne]], [[Jim Beglin]], [[Paddy Mulligan]], [[Johnny Fullam]], [[Mick Smyth]], [[Liam O'Brien (footballer)|Liam O'Brien]],and [[Eamon Dunphy]]. Irish [[Rugby union|Rugby]] international [[Tony Ward (rugby player)|Tony Ward]] also played for the club for a period in the 1970s. Up until the 1970s, Shamrock Rovers were well supported, attracting over 20,000 people regularly to Glenmalure Park and up to 40,000 for Cup Finals and European matches at [[Dalymount Park]]. Ultimately a combination of poor results, competition from televised football and other attractions meant that by the 1980s the club's crowds averaged below 3,000.  However, prior to a severe crisis that began in the late 1980s, Shamrock Rovers were still, to many, considered the most prestigious club in Irish football.

In [[1987]], the club's home ground was sold by the then owners, the Kilcoyne family. It was subsequently demolished and developed for housing. Supporters waged a long and acrimonious but futile campaign to save the ground. Home games were boycotted ultimately forcing out the Kilcoynes as owners. The club has been without a home from that time until the present. The most stable period since was while playing at the [[Royal Dublin Society]]'s grounds in [[Ballsbridge]] between 1990 and 1996. During this time Rovers won a league trophy (in 1994) and attracted reasonable crowds. Since then the club have been trying to develop a stadium in [[Tallaght]] and have played their home matches at several venues all over the city including [[Tolka Park]], [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]] and the athletics venue at [[Morton Stadium]] in [[Santry]]. 

Shamrock Rovers experienced severe financial troubles during the 2005 season, due to overspending and an accumulation of massive debts and spent a period under [[Examinership]] (a form of financial [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]]). The supporters association, 'the 400 club', who had been bankrolling the club during the Examinership process assumed control of the club. 

=== The Present ===

Today, Shamrock Rovers not only have a senior team and an Under 21 team operating in the eircom League but also an intermediate team, sixteen schoolboy teams, a senior ladies team and three schoolgirl teams. Shamrock Rovers Schoolboys have teams from u7s to u18s playing in the Dublin & District Schoolboys League and there are currently sixteen teams with a total of 208 players and these are looked after by 35 managers and coaches. With the exception of the senior team all these teams are based in Tallaght.

Shamrock Rovers are active participants of the [http://www.theredcard.ie Show Racism the Red Card Ireland] initiative. This includes giving out 'Show Racism the Red Card' posters at some matches during the season. {{Quote|Football is great for bringing people of all nationalities together. We need to encourage this in our everyday lives. We also need to recognise that talent comes from within regardless of race, colour or creed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rovers help Show Racism the Red Card | url=http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/pressarchive/press_release_23_June_2006.php | publisher = Shamrock Rovers F.C | date = 2006-6-23 | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>|Pat Scully|Pat Scully, Manager, Shamrock Rovers F.C.}}

===2007 Season===
Shamrock Rovers were promoted to the premier division after the 2006 season. They will have Tolka Park as the venue for their home games for the 2007 season.

===2006 Season===
[[Image:BarryMurphy-LeagueTitle-Cobh2006.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Murphy holding the 1st Division Cup aloft in Cobh.]]
Tolka Park was home to the Hoops for the 2006 season. The early matches saw Rovers start very brightly, first battling with Limerick FC, then Galway United and Dundalk for Division 1 supremacy. On Friday the 10th of November Rovers beat Finn Harps 4-0 in the penultimate match of the season to effectively win the First Division title. On Saturday 19th November the Hoops came from behind to get a 1-1 draw with Cobh Ramblers to secure the title. Rovers were presented with the 1st Division trophy after the match. The Rovers defence was the best in league history with only 13 goals conceded in 36 league games and 24 clean sheets kept. The 2006 Player of the Year is captain Aidan price and the Young Player of the Year was awarded to Ian Ryan.

Three points were deducted by the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] from the team's [[League of Ireland]] standings on 16 August 2006 for fielding a suspended player illegally.
 
Shamrock Rovers' pursuit of a first [[FAI Cup]] since [[1987]] advanced to the semi final stage after a 2-0 victory over non-league Castlebar Celtic in May, then a 2-0 win over [[Bohemian F.C.]] at [[Dalymount Park]] in September 2006, facilitated by two goals from David Cassidy. The result (pursuant to a 1-1 draw in the initial fixture at Tolka Park on live TV) cost [[Gareth Farrelly]] his job as Bohemians player/manager. Rovers then won a quarter final tie away to fellow First Division club [[Athlone Town F.C.]] 2-1 with goals from Ger Rowe and Robbie Clarke again on live television.

Shamrock Rovers were eliminated by [[St. Patrick's Athletic]] at the semi-final stage, losing 2-0 at Tolka Park on Friday, 27th [[October]] 2006. During the half time break Rovers legend [[Derek Tracey]] was introduced to a thundering ovation from the Rovers crowd. The club's quest for a 25th [[FAI Cup]] now extends into a second decade.

===2005 Season===

2005 goes down as one of the worst yet one of the best years in Shamrock Rovers history. The club had serious financial problems. Following a period of examinership during the summer months of 2005 the supporters group, the 400 Club, successfully bid for ownership of the club. Financial irregularities arising from this caused Rovers to be deducted 8 points in the league table. Roddy Collins was sacked towards the end of the 2005 season with 12 months remaining on his contract. Collins took this dismissal to Employment Appeals Tribunal and a settlement was reached with the former manager in 2006. Terry Eviston and Alan O'Neill took charge of the team for the remaining matches of the 2005 season.

The Hoops lost a two leg relegation play-off 3-2 against Dublin City F.C. and were relegated for the first time in the history.

===The early 2000's===

Home games for the new millennium were played in the Morton Stadium in Santry. Work began on the Tallaght Stadium in 2000 however as the building got stalled the Hoops would call Dalymount Park and Tolka Park home later in the decade. 

The closest the hoops came to silverware in the early 2000's was the 2002 FAI cup final. Rovers lost 1-0 to Derry City.

===The 1990's===

From 1990 to 1996 Rovers played their home games in the [[Royal_Dublin_Society|RDS]], Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. This was the closest the Hoops had to a permanent home since the closure of Milltown. The highlight of the decade was the thrilling 1993/94 season which saw the Hoops win the league for the fifteenth time and for the first time since leaving Milltown. Stephen Geoghegan scored twenty-three league goals that season and came within four of equalling Bob Fullam's record set in 1926/27.

The club chairman John McNamara sold out his interest in 1996 to a new consortium who, within a few months, announced exciting plans to bring Rovers to a new stadium in Tallaght on Dublin's south side. The original plan was to have an all-seated stadium with a capacity of 10,000 but serious objections by a group of local residents held the project up for years and work only began in 2000.

==Other Teams==
===Schoolboys & Schoolgirls===
Shamrock Rovers F.C. and Tallaght Town A.F.C. merged in 1997 to form a new schoolboys section to serve the Tallaght area in South West Dublin. Tallaght Town A.F.C. remained in operation with three intermediate teams participating in the Leinster Senior League. Two of these teams remain in operation today but are now playing under the name of Shamrock Rovers. Shamrock Rovers Schoolboys have teams from u7s to u18s playing in the Dublin District Schoolboys League and have continued to grow each year since 1997. There are currently sixteen teams with a total of 208 players and these are looked after by 35 managers and coaches. 

In 2002 the Under 17 team came through eight rounds to beat off the best and lift the Football Association of Ireland All Ireland Youths Cup. In 2003/2004 the then Under 14 team won the DDSL Major Division unbeaten and added the Harmon Cup to make it a memorable double. In the 2005 Northern Ireland Milk Cup, Shamrock Rovers took on Barcelona and did the club and Tallaght proud with a superb performance in a game in which they were unlucky to lose 2-1. Barcelona went on to win the tournament.

Shamrock Rovers have three schoolgirl teams.

The Rovers youth team have been invited to take part in the prestigious international [http://www.dallascup.com/ Dr Pepper Dallas Cup] next April in Texas, USA. Rovers will be the first ever Irish club to take part.

==Tallaght Community Stadium==

In the 1990's Shamrock Rovers were granted land in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght to build a new stadium. On Thursday the 30th of March 2000 An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005 [[South Dublin County Council]] announced that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. They plan now to complete the stadium and will run it as a municipal stadium with Shamrock Rovers as the preferred [[tenants]]. However, this has been challenged by some figures in the local [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] club, [[Thomas Davis (GAA Club)|Thomas Davis]] who want the design of the stadium modified so that their games could be played there, in the event of it becoming a municipal facility. 

These people have appealed the construction of a football-only stadium to the [[High Court (Republic of Ireland)|High Court]] arguing that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to our club (Thomas Davis), our sport and the GAA culture<ref>{{cite news | title = Landmark Day on cards for Hoops (quoting the affidavit to the High Court) | author = Paul Hyland | publisher = Evening Herald | pages=106-107| date = 2006-11-23 | accessdate = 2006-11-23 }}</ref>'. However the stadium, with the existing design, can accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium. It is only senior GAA games that would not be facilitated.<ref>{{cite news | title = GAA at Tallaght ground ruled out | url=http://www.unison.ie/sportsdesk/stories.php3?ca=13&si=1749905|author = Cliona Foley| publisher = [[Irish Independent]]|  date = 2007-01-05 | accessdate = 2007-01-05 }}</ref>

The Minister for Sport, Arts and Tourism has consistently supported the government decision to support the Stadium with soccer pitch dimensions<ref>

The [[judicial review]] will begin on April 20th 2007.

The stadium construction has been stalled by this legal case brought by Thomas Davis for 13 months as of March 2007. This delay means that Shamrock Rovers will have been without a home ground for over 20 years.

==Shamrock Rovers Members Club==
The Shamrock Rovers members club was originally formed as the '''400 Club''' in 2002, whereby supporters donate a fixed amount of money each month to help finance the football club. The monthly amount is <U+20AC>40. Initially the 400 Club was intended to secure a [[mortgage]] for the construction of the [[Tallaght Stadium]]. However, it later developed into an independent supporters association that ended up taking over the club in 2005. The 400 Club played a crucial part in paying for Rovers' recent progress through Examinership. They paid off a portion of the club's debts and then assumed responsibility for the running of the football club. The SRFC Members club has a Board of Directors known as Trustees. The Board is elected once a year. Each person who donates has one vote in relation to this Board. After the Examinership period, the Board of Trustees also became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club. At the 2006 AGM of the 400 Club there was a vote to rename the club as the SRFC Members Club. Currently, there are about 470 members.

==Supporters==
