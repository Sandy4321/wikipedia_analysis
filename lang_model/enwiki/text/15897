'''Queen's Pier''', named after [[Queen Victoria]], was a public ceremonial pier in front of [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall]] in [[Edinburgh Place]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Hong Kong]].  Its two generations have served as a ceremonial pier as well as a public pier, and have witnessed the official arrival in Hong Kong of all of [[Governor of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's governors]] since 1925; [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] landed there in 1975, [[Prince Charles|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] in 1989.

The pier, built along the newly reclaimed waterfront, was designed in a [[Modernism|modern utilitarian]] style, and was opened by Maurine Grantham, wife of Governor [[Alexander Grantham]] in June 1954. 

On [[26 April]] [[2007]], the pier was officially closed by the government in order to facilitate [[land reclamation]], soon after the adjacent Star Ferry pier was closed. There was fierce opposition by conservationists, who carried over their campaign to preserve the landmark. Police officers evicted some 30 protesters from the site on 1 August 2007; activists filed for a judicial review, and the High Court hearing began on 7 August. On 10 August, the court dismissed the request.

==History==
There was once a wooden pier which bore the name "Queen's Statue Wharf", which was replaced in 1925<ref name=EIA1 />. It was a ceremonial landing area for the [[British Royal Family]] visiting Hong Kong, and for successive governors to assert their authority on arrival. The first governor to land there was [[Cecil Clementi]], in November 1925. The preceding governor, [[Reginald Stubbs]], boarded the ''Victoria'' from the pier at the end of his term on 31 October 1925<ref name=EIA1/>.

===1925 Pier===
[[Image:Queen's pier.gif|thumb|400px|Full length of Queen's Pier, c.1930]]
The 1925 pier was originally named "Statue Pier", but was officially renamed "Queen's Pier" in honour of Queen Victoria on 31 July 1924<ref name=EIA1>[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/AAB_Paper129_queen_annexb_e.pdf "A Historical and Architectural Appraisal of Queen<U+2019>s Pier, Central (Annexe B3)], Antiquities and Monuments Office, Government of Hong Kong SAR, accessdate=2007-12-15</ref>. It was a sheltered pier made of concrete and steel, with round pillars and arches, built on the waterfront at [[Pedder Street]] on the site of the present [[Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong|Mandarin Oriental Hotel]]<ref>Martin Wong, "Ship has sailed for another landmark", [[South China Morning Post]], 18 December 2006, page 1</ref> at a cost of [[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]20,000<ref>"Final stages of Central reclamation, new Queen's Pier gets a cover", <U+5DE5><U+5546><U+65E5><U+5831><U+FF0C>12 February 1954 {{zh icon}}</ref>. Intended to open in time for the arrival of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward Albert of Windsor]], the [[Prince of Wales]], construction delays postponed its completion until October 1925.<ref name=EIA1/> It was demolished in January 1955<ref name="Phillips"/>.

===1954 Pier===
Due to post [[World War II|war]] reclamation, work commenced in February 1954 on a new pier on the new waterfront designed in a [[Modernism|modern utilitarian]] style<ref name=EIA1/>. The structure was described as a U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing<ref name=EIA1/>. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west. 

The pier was considered "an integral part" of ceremonial cluster of the [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall]] and [[Edinburgh Place]] which was being formed at the time, and the entrance to the City Hall formed an axis with the Pier to lend a sense of occasion to visiting dignatories. The secondary design goal was to maximise public access to the very limited open space in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] in contrast with the city bustle<ref name="Phillips">Liz Heron, "Save Queen's Pier, says architect of City Hall complex", [[South China Morning Post]], 13 May 2007, page 4</ref>.

The pier was opened by Maurine Grantham, wife of Governor [[Alexander Grantham]] on 28 June 1954<ref>Sara Z Al-Sudairy, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=50379&sid=14752469&con_type=1&d_str=20070802&sear_year=2007 Royal landing site valued by public], [[The Standard]], 2 August 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.

==Function==
[[Image:Queen's Pier 1925.jpg|thumb|300px|Queen's Pier (right), Clementi's inauguration in 1925]]
The pier's primary r<U+00F4>le was ceremonial. It was the traditional landing place of successive Governors, who would arrive at Central on board the official Governor's yacht which would dock at Queen's Pier. From the 1960s, Governors would inspect the [[Guard of honour]] at [[Edinburgh Place]], followed by the official swearing-in at the City Hall<ref name=EIA1/>. 

[[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] officially landed there on 4 May 1975 on her first visit, after arriving by plane at [[Kai Tak International Airport|Kai Tak Airport]]<ref>Raymond Yao, [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/01_08.01/136293.pdf "The Royal seal of stability"], [[Far Eastern Economic Review]], 16 May 1975, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>, Charles and Diana, the Prince and [[Princess of Wales]], landed there in November 1989. 

The pier's secondary r<U+00F4>le was as a public pier, where pleasure craft were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering a view of the [[Kowloon]] side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was the winning line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area; some fished. 

On 26 April 2007, the pier was officially closed in order to facilitate land reclamation in Central<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/26/news/hong.php "In Hong Kong, no looking back at Britain"], [[International Herald Tribune]], 26 April 2007, accessdate=2007-05-08</ref>.

==The Pier's future==
From the outset, the fate of the pier has been intimately linked with the [[Central and Wan Chai Reclamation|central reclamation project]] which was unveiled in 1989 but not explicitly spelled out as such. However, the scale of reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles.

===The Government's position===
[[Image:Victoria Harbour from City Hall 14-Oct-2005 (1).jpg|thumb|450px|[[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier|Old Star Ferry Pier]] (front left) and Queen's Pier (front right) in 2005. The new piers (background left) now in full operation.]]Following the controversy and the demolition of the [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier|Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place]] in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] policy of the [[Government of Hong Kong]]. The criticism received over its handling of the Star Ferry Pier caused the [[Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands]] to propose a piece-by-piece relocation of the pier to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legco]] session on 21 March 2007<ref name="move">Winnie Chong, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=40705&sid=12771187&con_type=1&d_str=20070322&sear_year=2007 "New spot for pier at old location"], The Standard, 22 March 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. The Government later unveiled four design options for such relocation<ref name="historic">Diana Lee, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=43679&sid=13442728&con_type=1&d_str=20070504&sear_year=2007 "Harbor option for Queen's Pier"], The Standard, 4 May 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. The intended closure of the pier was 26 April 2007.

At the end of January 2007, the government declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects,  the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the [[Conservancy Association]] were held<ref name="Anger"/>. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, it was reported that after meeting the government, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by [[Winston Chu]], founder of the [[Society for Protection of the Harbour]]<ref name="backtrack"/>. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed<ref name=HKIArelease>Press Statement: [http://www.hkia.net/queenspier_2007.php Approval of Funding for Dismantling and Reassembling Queen's Pier  by LegCo Public Works Subcommittee at its Meeting held on 23 May 2007], Hong Kong Institute of Architects, 7 June 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.  

[[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] said that being overzealous in saving the past may hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness, and called on activists to take a more balanced view toward economic growth and conservation. Soon after Tsang's [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|re-election of as Chief Executive]], on 26 March, the Government pressed ahead with plans to dismantle and move the entire pier, piece by piece, enabling the reclamation to go ahead<ref>[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070326/html/070326en06004.htm Pier preservation plan proposed], HK Government, 26 March 2007</ref>.  

The government stated the in-situ preservation, though apparently viable on paper, would risk irreversible damage to the pier. Furthermore, it argued that important underground facilities such as the Airport Railway Extended Overrun Tunnel would be affected, saying a natural curvature of the track was required<ref name="move"/>. "Setting aside the technical difficulties and the huge risk involved in the works, underpinning for the construction of the extended overrun tunnel would cost about [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]500 million and take more than two years to complete"<ref name="move"/>.

Appearing before a public forum at the pier on 29 July, Secretary for Development Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor repeated the government's insistence that keeping the pier was not an option. She would not give the people false hope<ref name="death knell">Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=2&art_id=50121&sid=14706405&con_type=3&d_str=20070730&sear_year=2007 "Death knell on pier"], The Standard, 30 July 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. Although Lam's performance in  public debates was praised<ref name="debate">Scarlett Chiang & Anson Douglas, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=50123&sid=14706306&con_type=1&d_str=20070730&sear_year=2007 "Lam scores well in heated debate"], The Standard, 30 July 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>, the Secretary for Development's conflict of interest as the head of the Antiquities Authority was criticised. Lam said the AAB did not have governmental authority, and that it had not suggested keeping the pier in its totality<ref name="death knell"/>.

====Dismantling and storing====
At the end of July 2007, the Development Bureau issued a paper for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]'s lands and works panel. Hoardings to be erected by the end of July, and the target for completing "preservation works" by November. It was suggested for the pier's pitched roof to be disassembled into halves and the 34 concrete columns to be cut at roof and deck level. The pieces would be labeled and then lifted by a crane barge and transported to the government's explosives depot in [[Lantau]], where it would be stored under guard<ref name="cut up">Diana Lee & Scarlett Chiang, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=49343&sid=14544237&con_type=3&d_str=20070719&sear_year=2007 Queen's Pier to be cut up and stored at month's end], The Standard, 19 July 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. The paper suggested that reassembling it in the same location could take as long as December 2012, as re-alignment of the proposed Road P2 would be involved.

===Conservationists' position===
Ron Phillips, original designer of the pier, backed preservation, saying that any loss of the City Hall and the adjacent open space would be something "future generations will come to regret"<ref name="Phillips"/>. The Hong Kong Institute of Architects denounced the government's insistence that dismantling and reassembling of the Pier was the only feasible option, in disregard of the pier's "grade 1" status. The architects concluded that the "technical difficulties were not irresolvable, and the government<U+2019>s reasons for not revising the current infrastructural design were not at all convincing<ref name=HKIArelease/>."

[[Environmentalism|Environmental]] groups were angred by the Government's [[technobabble]], and for inflating the costs and technical difficulties of keeping the pier at the original site<ref name="Anger">Audrey Parwani, "Anger over plan to dismantle pier", South China Morning Post, 27 March 2007, page B1</ref>. The proposed 40 metre wide road, planned in the 1980s, was now "obsolete", and would make the waterfront "inaccessible to the public<ref name="don't kid">Audrey Parwani, "Don't kid the public on when the pier will be rebuilt, party says",  [[South China Morning Post]], 7 June 2007, page C4</ref>". Albert Lai, Chairman of the Hong Kong People's Council for Sustainable Development, drew attention to the fact that the budgeted spending for infrastructure over the past three years of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]90 billion contrasted poorly with HK$90 million spent on acquiring and renovating heritage sites<ref name="Tsang"/>. 

The [[Civic Party]] accused the Government of misleading the public: the development plans for the [[North Island Line]] precluded the restoration the pier before 2016<ref name="don't kid"/>. [[Christine Loh]] criticised Donald Tsang for failing to grasp the  economical, cultural and social importance of heritage<ref name="Tsang">Jonathan Cheng, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=2&art_id=37101&sid=11945933&con_type=1&d_str=20070129&sear_year=2007 "Protect heritage and growth, urges Tsang"], The Standard, 29 January 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.

===Preservation campaign battlefronts===
====Public and media====
In September 2004, legislator Law Chi-kwong took a swim in Victoria Harbour bearing a plaque saying "Goodbye to the Queen", to protest the [[Central and Wan Chai Reclamation]], particularly the loss of Queen's Pier<ref>[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=9508&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20040908&sear_year=2004 "Legislator in protest swim"], Associated Press, 8 September 2004, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.

[[Image:QP protest banners.jpg|thumb|250px|Banners erected by protesters, tents on the rooftop]]
Soon after the unsuccessful attempt to save the Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign to preserve the pier ''in situ'' was launched. Ahead of the closure, members of the public, environmentalists, and some lawmakers arrived to tie blue ribbons to indicate their desire to preserve [[Victoria Harbour|the harbour]]. On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in a last-ditch attempt to urge the Government to reconsider<ref name="backtrack">Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=42807&sid=13259364&con_type=1&d_str=20070423&sear_year=2007 "Groups accused of backtracking on Queen's Pier], The Standard, 23 April 2007</ref>: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected<ref name="protest">Joshua But, "Protest voyagers sail from pier", [[South China Morning Post]], C4, 23 April 2007</ref>. 

[[Image:QP Hungerstrike.jpg|thumb|250px|The hunger-strikers' encampment, day 3]]
An occupation of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted by the appearance of [[Chow Yun-fat]] early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters<ref name="yunfat">Chloe Lai, "Chow Yun-fat signs pier petition", [[South China Morning Post]], 29 April 2007, page 3</ref>.

On July 27, three students, as part of a group called ' ''Local Action''' started a hunger strike on the pier<ref name="hunger strike">"Pier protesters stage hunger strike", [[South China Morning Post]], 28 July 2007, page 1</ref>. Hunger-striker Chan King-fai said: "The government wasn't chosen by us. All we can do is to use our humble and limited voices<ref name="hunger strike"/>." The Government countered this with a communications offensive, announcing that Secretary for Development Carrie Lam would appear on [[RTHK]]'s City's Forum and at a public forum on 29 July at the pier<ref name="hunger strike"/>.

On 30 July, the Government ordered an end to the "unlawful occupation" of government land by midnight. Activists vowed to defy the order; a candlelight vigil held at the pier was attended by 200 sympathisers. The Government did not risk a violent confrontation immediately on the expiry of the eviction deadline<ref>Damon Pang, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=50293&sid=14736283&con_type=1&d_str=20070801&sear_year=2007 "Protesters spend one last night at Queen's Pier"], The Standard, 1 August 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.

====In Legco====
An application for HK$50 million to fund the dismantling and relocating of the pier was scheduled for debate by the Public Works sub-committee on 9 May 2007, the same day the Antiquities Advisory Board would hold a public hearing to decide on the historical grading of the pier<ref name="Anger"/>. Government stressed the timing was "a coincidence"<ref name=antiquities/>, and steadfastly refused to defer the vote pending an outcome of the AAB vote.

On 9 May, after an hour-long heated debate, the government was forced to withdraw its motion<ref name=antiquities>Damon Pang, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=44107&sid=13530773&con_type=3&d_str=20070510&sear_year=2007 "Antiquities backing to save Queen's Pier"], The Standard, 10 May 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref> due to the lack of support. Choy So-yuk, from the usually pro-Government [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong|DAB]], called for the vote to be postponed, and the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] equally did not back the Government<ref name="weak crab">Ambrose Leung, "Pier failure shows Tsang team 'like a weak crab'", [[South China Morning Post]], 11 May 2007, page 1</ref>. However, Government ministers declared that it had "no plans to list the pier as a [[declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monument]]", and insisted that there was "no direct relationship between the grading and whether we will demolish and relocate the pier"<ref name=antiquities/>. During the debate, the Director of [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department|Leisure and Cultural Services]] also said that even if the site was pronounced a first-class monument, there remained no legally binding prohibition against its demolition<ref name=antiquities/>. Liberal Party Chairman [[James Tien]] said that, in failing to muster support to implement its policies, "the Government is like a crab with weak legs"<ref name="weak crab"/>.

The government claimed that its handling of the issue had been "in line with pledges made by Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen during his recent re-election campaign" to regain the moral high ground regarding heritage preservation, following the mistakes of the Star Ferry saga<ref>Carrie Chan, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=44119&sid=13534026&con_type=1&d_str=20070510&sear_year=2007 "New policy aims will lead heritage debate"], The Standard, 10 May 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. Civic Party legislative councillor Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung said that there was "no sincerity [from the government] to preserve historic venues"<ref name=antiquities/>.

The public works subcommittee approved the Government's re-submitted request for funds to dismantle and relocate Queen's Pier on 23 May in a 10-7 vote<ref name=nod>Diana Lee, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=45173&sid=13752998&con_type=1&d_str=20070524&sear_year=2007 "Pier demolition cash bid gets nod"], 24 May 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>. Choy So-yuk, who voted against the appropriation on 9 May, abstained.

The Hong Kong Institute of Architects said it "regretted the funding approval"<ref name=HKIArelease/>.

====Antiquities Advisory Board grading vote====
The [[Antiquities Advisory Board]] (AAB) held a public hearing 9 May, and Board members voted a 'Grade 1' listing for the pier by a majority<ref name=antiquities/>. Twelve members voted for Grade 1 listing, and ten voted for Grade 2 listing. However, the status is not-binding on the Government<ref name="historic">"Historic status for pier, but future still in doubt", Chloe Lai, [[South China Morning Post]], 10 May 2007, page 1</ref>. 

After the hearing, an activist from 'Local Action' declared the AAB's decision a victory for the people, and warned the government "not to treat the voice of the people lightly"<ref name=antiquities/>. 

====Legal challenge====
As Lands Department officials arrived on 30 July to put up notices ordering an end to the "unlawful occupation" of government land, the activists filed for a judicial review<ref>Damon Pang,  [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=50212&sid=14718283&con_type=3&d_str=20070731&sear_year=2007 "Court challenge as tussle looms on pier"], The Standard, 31 July 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>, claiming that [[Secretary for Home Affairs]]' decision not to declare the structure a monument was unreasonable and illegal<ref name="Straits Times">[http://www.straitstimes.com/Asia/China/Story/STIStory_144415.html "Hong Kong court delays demolition of historic Queen's Pier"], [[The Straits Times]], 1 August 2007, accessdate=2007-8-07</ref>.
