'''Franklin Thompson Matthias''' (13 March 1908<U+2013>3 December 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[civil engineer]] who directed construction of the [[Hanford nuclear site]], a key facility of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]].

A graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]], Matthias joined the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) as a Junior Hydraulic Engineer in 1935, and worked on hydroelectric projects. In April 1941, he was called to active duty by the [[United States Army]], and joined the Construction Division of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. He was area engineer at the Manhattan Project's Hanford site from 1942 to 1945. As such, he supervised the an enormous construction effort that included three chemical separation plants so large that they were known as "Queen Marys", and the world's first three production-scale [[nuclear reactor]]s.

After the war Matthais went to Brazil where he helped build a hydroelectric facility. He joined the [[Aluminum Company of Canada]] (Alcoa) in 1951, and was involved in the construction of its [[Kemano]]-[[Kitimat]] [[Kenney Dam|hydroelectric dam]] and aluminum smelter project in northern [[British Columbia]] and the [[Passes-Dangereuses, Quebec|Chute-des-Passes]] project in Quebec. He was a vice president at Kaiser Engineering from 1960 to 1973.

On 1 August 1933, Matthias married Reva Baumgarten, a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin, who taught speech therapy in schools in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiclarkcountyhistory.org/1data/34/34176.htm |title=Baumgarten, Reva  }|accessdate=18 February 2015  |publisher=Clark County, Wisconsin History}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/wi/county/clark/2data/47/47944.htm |title=Baumgarten, Reva May #2 |accessdate=18 February 2015  |publisher=Clark County, Wisconsin History}</ref> In 1935 he was hired by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) as a Junior Hydraulic Engineer, and worked on hydroelectric and hydraulic problems and on construction, planning and plant design. He left the TVA in 1939, and spent a year working with a contractor on dredging the [[Tennessee River]]. In 1940 and 1941 he worked for the A. L. Johnson Construction Company, and  on tunnels and aqueducts for the [[Dravo Corporation]].<ref name="UW-Madison"/><ref name="Mary B. Coney">Mary B.

==World War II==
[[File:Hanford B-Reactor Area 1944.jpg|thumb|right|[[B reactor]] in June 1944]]
In April 1941, Matthias was called to active duty by the [[United States Army]] as a [[first lieutenant]], and joined the Construction Division of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], where he received rapid promotion.<ref name="UW-Madison"/> On 14 December 1942, as a 34-year-old [[lieutenant colonel]], he accompanied Colonel [[Kenneth Nichols]] to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], to discuss the location of a proposed [[plutonium]] production plant with representatives of [[DuPont]]. At this point, Matthias had not yet been assigned to the [[Manhattan Project]], whose mission was to build an [[atomic bomb]], but he had worked on some special studies for it, and had worked with its director, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], on the construction of [[The Pentagon]].{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=72<U+2013>74}} He was already Groves's choice for area engineer for the plutonium project.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=108<U+2013>110}}

Initially, the intention had been to locate the plutonium plant with the Manhattan Project's other production facilities at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], but concerns had arisen about the dangers of an atomic explosion, and [[Knoxville]] lay only {{convert|20|mi}} away. A larger site was required where facilities could be separated from each other. It had to be in a sparsely populated but accessible area with access to abundant water and electric power.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=108<U+2013>110}} When he returned from the meeting, Matthias was met by Groves, who instructed him to take a survey team and find a suitable site.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=72<U+2013>74}}  Matthias surveyed four sites in California and Washington, and chose the area around [[Richland, Washington]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=108<U+2013>110}}

Matthais later recalled that:{{quote|As far as my working relationship with Du Pont was concerned, of course, we had differences from day one. I was fortunate that Gil Church and Walt Simon (Du Pont's project construction manager and operations manager) were people I could deal with and respect, and we had a very good working relationship. I remember one time Granville Read (Du Pont's assistant chief engineer) called up Groves and said Matthias and Church were having a big argument about something and what should we do? Groves replied, "Well, if those two guys don't have some arguments, then neither of them are worth a damn."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/franklin-matthiass-interview-1986 |title=1986 Audio Interview with Col.

[[File:Hanford workers.jpg|thumb|left|Hanford workers awaiting paychecks at the Western Union office.]]
Because of the isolation of the site, known as the [[Hanford nuclear site|Hanford Engineer Works]], Matthias exercised more administrative autonomy than the Manhattan Project's other area engineers. The number of personnel assigned to his office grew to over 500 in 1944.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=108<U+2013>110}} Construction work commenced on the {{convert|400000|acre|adj=on}} site in April 1943.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=212, 453<U+2013>454}} The size of the construction work force eventually reached 44,900 in June 1944;{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=138}} over 150,000 workers were employed at the site between 1943 and 1946.<ref name="obit"/>

The scale of the task was enormous. Matthias supervised the construction of 554 buildings, {{convert|386|mi}} of roads, {{convert|158|mi}} miles of railroad track, three chemical separation plants and the world's first three production-scale [[nuclear reactor]]s.<ref name="obit"/> The {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}}-long chemical separation plants, where the plutonium was separated from uranium slugs that had been irradiated in the reactors, were so large that they were known as "Queen Marys", after the [[RMS Queen Mary|ocean liner]]. Because the slugs were dangerously radioactive, the Queen Marys had concrete walls {{convert|7|ft}} thick, and operations were by remote control.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=603<U+2013>604}}

The first production batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered the first batch of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where he handed it over to another courier, who took it to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]].{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=603<U+2013>604}}{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=141}} Plutnium from Hanford would be used in the [[Fat Man]] bomb used in the [[bombing of Nagasaki]].<ref name="obit"/> For his wartime services, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]].<ref name="UW-Madison"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/Famous/Matthias |title=Franklin Matthias |publisher= [[United States Department of Energy]] |date=30 July 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

==Later life==
Matthias left the Army in 1946 and went to Brazil as a project manager for the construction for a hydroelectric facility, eventually becoming the Manager of Engineering at Brazilian Traction. Late in 1951 he joined the [[Aluminum Company of Canada]] (Alcoa) as the Project Manager of Engineering and Construction of the [[Kemano]]-[[Kitimat]] [[Kenney Dam|hydroelectric dam]] and aluminum smelter project in northern [[British Columbia]].  In 1956 he moved to Montreal as its Director of Engineering, and worked on the [[Passes-Dangereuses, Quebec|Chute-des-Passes]] project. In 1960 he joined Kaiser Engineering in [[Oakland, California]], as its  Vice President for Heavy construction and Hydroelectric engineering, and  was its Vice President of Transportation Projects  from 1970 to 1973. He retired in 1973, at the age of 65.<ref name="Mary B. Coney"/><ref name="UW-Madison"/>

Matthias was a Registered Professional Engineer in Wisconsin, California, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and British Columbia.<ref name="UW-Madison"/> For some years after his retirement he remained active as a consultant, working for firms including Kaiser Engineering, [[Pacific Gas and Electric]], [[Louisiana Pacific]] and [[Bechtel]].<ref name="Mary B. Coney"/> He was a member of the Advisory Board of the California Water Resources Association, the Committee on Large Dams, Committee on Construction of Nuclear Facilities, and the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. He also wrote  the chapter on "Construction Services" in the ''Handbook of Heavy Construction'' (1971).<ref name="UW-Madison"/>      
    
In 1993, he was informed that he had cancer of the lungs, liver and pancreas. He died six week later, on 3 December 1993, at a nursing home in [[Walnut Creek, California]]. He was survived by his son Michael and younger brother Carl.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |title= F. T.
