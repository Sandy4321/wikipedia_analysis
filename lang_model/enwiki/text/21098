The following is a '''list of [[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the [[United States of America|U.S.]] state of [[Delaware]]'''. Since reliable records began, no [[tropical cyclone]] has struck the state while maintaining [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane intensity]], and only two storms since 1851 caused hurricane-force winds in the state.</onlyinclude><ref name="climo">{{cite web|author=Blake, Rappaport, Jarrell, & Landsea|year=2005|title=Frequently Requested Hurricane Facts|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-07-23|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/dcmifinal2.pdf}}</ref> The state often experiences the direct effects of landfalling [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclones]], such as rainfall or strong winds, as well as the effects of storms that remain offshore, such as rip currents or heavy surf. Since 1749, at least 96 tropical cyclones, some of which had become [[extratropical]], have affected the state, including 21 which passed over the state.
