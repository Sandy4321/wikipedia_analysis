}}'''Lewis Price''' (born [[July 19]], [[1984]] in [[Bournemouth]]) is a [[Wales|Welsh]] international [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] who currently plays for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].

Price, who graduated through the Ipswich Town youth system, is an agile performer who became known for stepping in for [[Kelvin Davis]] during the [[2004-05 in English football|2004-05]] season and saving a penalty against Coventry. After Davies returned from injury, Price played for [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] on loan for part of the season. Davis departed at the end of the 2004-5 season, with Price contesting [[Shane Supple]] to be first choice between the sticks. 

Price received his first call-up to the full [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international squad for a friendly against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] on [[17 August]] [[2005]], but missed out on his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] after he was forced to withdraw with a knee injury. He then made his debut against [[Cyprus]] on [[17 November]] [[2005]]. He now has 2 international caps

In August 2006 he revealed that he would like to go out on loan to get some more footballing experience but stated that he does not want to leave Portman Road. 

Since then he has started nearly every game ahead of first choice keeper Shane Supple. 

==Trivia==

Just a week after [[Petr <U+010C>ech]] and [[Carlo Cudicini]] sustained horrific injuries which brought up an argument that goalkeepers need more protection, Lewis was then injuried in Ipswich's 3-1 victory over [[Southend United]]. Price had to be stretchered off after colliding with [[Matt Harrold]].
