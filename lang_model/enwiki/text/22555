The resolution of the [[Comintern]] of January 11, 1934, was an official political document, in which for the first time, an authoritative international organization provided directions for recognizing of the existence of a separate [[Macedonian nation]] and [[Macedonian language]].<ref>Duncan Perry, "The Republic of Macedonia: finding its way" in Karen Dawisha and Bruce Parrot (eds.), Politics, power and the struggle for Democracy in South-Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 228-229.</ref> At that time there were a few ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed and among the majority of the Macedonian Slavs coexisted pro-Bulgarian ethnic sentiments and Macedonian regional identity.<ref>''During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.''

In June 1931 the registrar of the Comintern [[Otto Kuusinen]] in his report on the [[national question]] to the Executive Committee, suggested that the main weakness of the Comintern was the insufficient appreciation of the national questions.<ref><U+041A> <U+0443> <U+0443> <U+0441> <U+0438> <U+043D> <U+0435> <U+043D>, <U+041E>. <U+0421><U+043B><U+0430><U+0431><U+0438><U+044F><U+0442> <U+0443><U+0447><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+044A><U+043A> <U+043E><U+0442> <U+0444><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+041A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+043D><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430>. <U+2014> <U+041A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443><U+043D><U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E> <U+0437><U+043D><U+0430><U+043C><U+0435>, VIII. 1931, <U+2116> 9, <U+0441>. 19.</ref> Kuusinen called to discuss the national question in order to develop a new national program for each of the parties. Meanwhile, to the Balkan communist parties a directive was provided, for the gradual abandonment of the slogan of the [[Balkan Federation]], highlighting in its foreground the "''right of the distinct peoples of self-determination to a full separation''". The reason for this political turning, was the rising of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]]. Thus in 1932 a members of the Comintern sponsored [[IMRO (United)]], put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation.<ref><U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0438><U+0437><U+0445><U+043E><U+0434><U+044A><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043C><U+0430><U+043A><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> - <U+0421><U+0442><U+0435><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+0430> <U+043E><U+0442> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+041C><U+0430><U+043A><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+044F> <U+041D><U+0430><U+0443><U+0447><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0418><U+043D><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0442><U+0443><U+0442> <U+0432> <U+0421><U+043E><U+0444><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437> 1947 <U+0433>.</ref> This question was discussed among them, however, there was a split when Vasil Hadzhikimov and his group, refused to agree that the Macedonians are a separate people from the Bulgarians.
