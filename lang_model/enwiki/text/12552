'''Ricardo Elvio Pavoni C<U+00FA>neo''' (born July 8, 1943 in [[Montevideo]]) is an [[Uruguay]]an former [[football (soccer)]] [[defender (football)|defender]] who played the majority of his career for [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Independiente]] in the [[Argentine First Division]].

==Biography==
Elvio Pavoni was born in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] and began his footballing career with the Montevidean club [[Defensor Sporting|Defensor]]. Disillusioned with life as a footballer, he was on the point of abandoning the game completely and going to work in a [[casino]] as a [[croupier]] until he was convinced to play football for [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Independiente|Independiente]] of [[Argentina]]. Undeniably one of Independiente's all-time stars, the left-sided full-back has been described as a natural leader and the perfect man-marker. He was also responsible for scoring 57 goals.

He arrived to Independiente at age 21 to replace [[Tom<U+00E1>s Rolan]], another Uruguayan who had suffered a serious injury. No-one could have predicted that Pavoni would make people forget about Rolan and would be part of one of the most memorable periods in the club's history. His first match for Independiente was on March 24, 1965 in a [[Copa Libertadores]] match. Independiente beat [[Boca Juniors]] by two goals to nil.

For twelve seasons (1965<U+2013>1976) he was idolised by the Independiente fans. He was particularly remembered for his powering runs along the left wing, putting away free kicks with his left foot and for his frequent last-ditch efforts to clear the ball from the goal-line. He is considered by many to be the archetypal Uruguayan footballer.

Pavoni (affectively known as "el Chivo") won many honours during his career, including the [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n Argentina|Argentine first division]] championships three times, the [[Copa Libertadores]] 5 times, the [[Copa Interamericana]] on three occasions and one [[Copa Intercontinental]]. He was also a member of the Uruguayan squad that took part in the [[Football World Cup 1974|World Cup of 1974]], in [[West Germany]]. Since retirement, he has been involved with the club as a trainer with reserve and youth teams. He has also been caretaker manager of the first team on several occasions.
