==Plot ==
Set in the future, the novel follows the rise of a [[Lieutenant]] (known in the book only as "The Lieutenant") as he becomes dictator of [[England]] after a world war. The Lieutenant leads a ragtag army fighting for survival in a [[Europe]] ravaged by 30 years of atomic, biological and conventional warfare. As a result of the most recent war, a form of [[biological warfare]] called ''soldier<U+2019>s sickness'' has ravaged England, and [[United States of America|America]] was devastated by [[nuclear war]]. At the start of the novel, a [[quarantine]] placed on England due to the soldier<U+2019>s sickness prevents The Lieutenant from returning to from his encampment in [[France]]. The Lieutenant commands the Fourth Brigade, which is composed of one hundred and sixty-eight soldiers from multiple nations, leading them throughout France in search of food, supplies, arms and ammunition. Soon, Captain Malcolm informs The Lieutenant that all field officers are being recalled to General Headquarters (G.H.Q.) with their brigades to report to General Victor, the commanding officer at G.H.Q.

Upon the brigade's arrival at G.H.Q., The Lieutenant is informed by General Victor and his [[adjutant]] Colonel Smythe that he is to be reassigned and will be stripped of his command. He is confined to his quarters and is told his entire brigade will be broken apart and assimilated into another brigade. Meanwhile, in the [[barracks]] at G.H.Q., the Fourth Brigade learns of crucial news through back channels: a vaccine exists for the soldier's sickness, and General Victor<U+2019>s plans for their brigade. The men decide to rebel, and break through the defenses of the barracks, free The Lieutenant and kill Captain Malcolm. The Fourth Brigade successfully escapes G.H.Q. in France and begins to make their way to London, along with other soldiers who are dissatisfied with General Victor's command. A battle ensues between General Victor's men and The Lieutenant's troops. The Lieutenant and his expanded Fourth Brigade eventually successfully take control of London and subsequently all of England and Wales.

The Lieutenant's government runs smoothly for years, until the [[battleship]] ''U.S.S. New York'' arrives from the U.S. carrying two [[United States Senator]]s and Captain Johnson, captain of the ''New York'' and commander of the U.S. fleet. Under threat from the U.S. battleship, The Lieutenant negotiates terms to transfer power to the Senators' associates &ndash; General Victor and Colonel Smythe. If anything happens to General Victor and Colonel Smythe, the country would be controlled by its officer corps. chaired by the Lieutenants confidant Swinburne. In addition, The Lieutenant requests that immigration of Americans to England be kept to no more than 100,000 per month, and demands that a favorable price be set for the purchase of land from their English owners. After these terms are established, The Lieutenant opens fire on General Victor and his men and a battle ensues. General Victor, Colonel Smythe and The Lieutenant and several of his men are killed. Years later The Lieutenant<U+2019>s men still control England, and a flag flies honoring his memory. A memorial plaque at Byward Gate on [[Tower Hill]] reads: "When that command remains, no matter what happens to its officer, he has not failed."
