'''Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao''' (born [[December 17]], [[1978]]), simply known as '''Manny Pacquiao''' or '''Pac-Man''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[boxing|boxer]]. He is currently the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of WBC world champions#Lightweight|Lightweight Champion]] and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of WBC world champions#Super featherweight|Super Featherweight Champion]], and was the former world champion at [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Super Bantamweight]], and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[Flyweight]] divisions, therefore making him the first [[Filipino]] and [[Asian]] boxer to win four world titles in four weight divisions. He took over as the [[Ring Magazine pound for pound]] number 1 ranked boxer in the world on [[June 9]], [[2008]] after [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] announced his retirement from boxing.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Ring Ratings | publisher = ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' | url = http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/ratings2.html | accessdate = 2008-06-11 }}</ref>

==Biography==

Pacquiao started his professional boxing career in 1995 at 106 lbs (Light flyweight) at the age of 16 years. His early fights usually took place in small venues and were shown on [[Vintage Television's|Vintage Sports']] ''Blow by Blow,'' an evening boxing show. His professional debut was a 4-round bout against Edmund Ignacio on [[January 22]], [[1995]], which Pacquiao won via decision, becoming an instant star of the program. 

His weight increased from 106 to 113 lbs before losing in his 12th bout against [[Rustico Torrecampo]] via a third-round [[technical knockout]] (TKO). As what [[sportscaster]] [[Quinito Henson|Joaquin "Quinito" Henson]] observed, Pacquiao clearly had not made weight. So he was forced to use heavier gloves than Torrecampo, thereby putting Pacquiao at a disadvantage.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Shortly after the Torrecampo fight, Pacquiao settled at 112 lbs, winning the WBC Flyweight title over [[Chatchai Sasakul]] in the eighth round only to lose it in his second defense against [[Medgoen Singsurat]], or Medgoen 3K Battery, via a third-round knockout on a bout held at [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Thailand]]. Technically, Pacquiao lost the belt at the scales by surpassing the required weight of 112 lbs (51 kg).

Following his loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao gained weight anew, this time stopping at the superbantamweight division of 122 lbs (55 kg), where he picked up the WBC International Super Bantamweight title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came. 

Pacquiao's big break came on [[June 23]], [[2001]], against IBF Super Bantamweight champion [[Lehlohonolo Ledwaba]]. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and won the fight by technical knockout to become the IBF Super Bantamweight champion on a bout held at [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. He defended this title four times and fought to a sixth-round draw against [[Agapito Sanchez]] in a bout that was stopped early after Pacquiao received a headbutt.

===Pacquiao's rise===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Morales_pacquiao_fightposter.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A boxing poster of Morales vs. Pacquiao, II Trilogy.]] -->
Pacquiao went on to defend his title four times before the match that many consider to have defined his career, a bout against the [[Mexican]] boxing idol [[Marco Antonio Barrera]]. Pacquiao, moving up in weight and in his first fight ever in the featherweight division, brought his power with him and defeated Barrera via a TKO in the 11th round at the [[Alamodome]], [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Although this fight was not recognized as a title fight by any sanctioning bodies, Pacquiao was recognized as world champion by [[Ring Magazine]] after his victory <ref>http://philboxing.com/news/story-2824.html</ref>, and he held that title until relinquishing it in 2005.

Only 6 months removed from his win over Barrera, Pacquiao went on to challenge another respected Mexican counterpuncher, [[Juan Manuel M<U+00E1>rquez]], then holder of the [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) and International Boxing Federation (IBF) Featherweight titles. The fight held at the MGM Grand ended in a controversial draw after he knocked down M<U+00E1>rquez three times in the first round but lost most of the latter rounds. One of the judges later admitted to making an error in the scorecards because he scored the first round as "10-7" in favor of Pacquiao instead of the standard "10-6" for a three-knockdown round.

In a bout held at [[Taguig City]], Philippines, Pacquiao fought against Fahsan (3K-Battery) Por Thawatchai. Pacquiao sent 3K-Battery to the canvas three times en route to a [[knockout]] in the fourth round. A left uppercut to the jaw that lifted the Thai fighter's feet off the canvas ended the fight.

Manny once again moved up another division from 126 to 130 lbs to fight another Mexican legend, three-time division champion [[<U+00C9>rik Morales]] on [[March 19]], [[2005]], at the MGM Grand. However, this time around, at his first fight in the superfeatherweight division, Pacquiao lost the 12-round match by a unanimous decision from the judges. 

On [[September 10]], [[2005]], Manny Pacquiao knocked out [[H<U+00E9>ctor Vel<U+00E1>zquez]], capturing the WBC International Super Featherweight title in the process, in a fight held at [[Staples Center]], [[Los Angeles, California]].

Pacquiao defeated Morales via a 10th-round TKO in a much-anticipated rematch on [[January 21]], [[2006]] in Las Vegas at [[Thomas and Mack Center]]. <!--The result of the third match is given below, do not add it here for it will screw up the chronology.-->

===Newfound fame===
After the Morales bout, Pacquiao was in the limelight again during the first week of February 2006 when a waitress working in a Manila nightclub claimed that he was the father of her son, born out of a whirlwind affair with the boxer. The boxer, allegedly, was giving the child financial support, which was also kept secret from his wife, Jinkee, until she found out. This caused a problem in their marriage, but things were soon mended. 

Trainer [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]] had previously voiced concerns about the late- night lifestyle and warned that the boxer was in danger of losing both his edge and focus. Roach noted that there are too many distractions surrounding Pacquiao in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news

On [[July 2]], [[2006]], Pacquiao defeated another Mexican, [[Oscar Larios]], a two-time superbantamweight champion. Despite his camp's big promise of an early knockout, the fight went until the final round, with Pacquiao knocking down the Mexican two times during the 12-round bout for the WBC International Super Featherweight title held at the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], Philippines.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070309135644/newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=7812 Manny Pacquiao's tune up fight Philippines vs. Mexico]</ref>

In September 2006, Pacquiao signed a major deal with [[Golden Boy Promotions]] (GBP), headed by [[Oscar de la Hoya]], which was good for seven fights.<ref>{{cite news

With regard to profits made on each fight, Pacquiao would receive at least 90%, whereas the remaining 10% would go to Golden Boy Promotions.

Pacquiao and Morales fought for a third time (with the series tied 1-all) on [[November 18]], [[2006]]. Witnessed by a near-record crowd of 18,276, the match saw Pacquiao defeating Morales via a third-round knockout at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite news

After the Pacquiao-Morales rematch, Arum announced that Manny returned his signing bonus check back to Golden Boy Promotions, signaling intentions to stay with Top Rank. This resulted in GBP's decision to sue the famed fighter over contractual breaches.<ref>{{cite news

At the end of 2006, he was named by both [[HBO]] and [[Ring Magazine]] as the fighter of the year, with HBO also naming him as the most exciting fighter of the year. 

After a failed promotional negotiation with Marco Antonio Barrera's camp, [[Bob Arum]] chose [[Jorge Solis]] as his next opponent among several fighters that Bob Arum offered him to fight as a replacement. The bout was held in [[San Antonio]] on [[April 14]], [[2007]]. In the sixth round of the bout, an accidental headbutt occurred, giving Pacquiao a cut under his left eyebrow. The fight ended in the eight round when Pacquiao knocked Solis down twice; with Solis barely beating the count after the second knockdown, the referee (who was also a doctor) was prompted to stop the fight. The victory raised Pacquiao's win-draw-loss record to 44-3-2, with 35 KOs.

On [[June 29]], [[2007]], it was announced that [[Top Rank Boxing|Top Rank]] and GBP agreed to settle their lawsuit, meaning the long-awaited rematch with Marco Antonio Barrera will occur despite being the number 1 contender for the super-featherweight title of Juan Manuel Marquez.

Since Bob Arum was out on a vacation, GBP's chief executive Richard Schaefer politely declined to discuss Pacquiao<U+2019>s purse from the [[October 6]], [[2007]] rematch with Marco Antonio Barrera (at the Mandalay Bay Resort Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas). However, Pacquiao was likely to get a purse of $5 million, plus possibly a share of the pay-per-view rights.<ref>{{cite news

Two judges scored the bout 118-109, whereas the third scored it 115-112.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-pacquiaoearly100607&prov=yhoo&type=lgns  sports.yahoo.com, Pacquiao rolls past Barrera in rematch]</ref>

In [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] magazine, Pacquiao (45-3-2) remained at the top of the junior lightweight division (130 lbs). He had been in the ratings for 108 weeks. Pacquiao was also at No. 2 in the pound-for-pound category behind welterweight champ Floyd Mayweather.<ref>{{cite web

On November 18, 2007, the Manila Bulletin Online edition reported a possible bout between Pacquiao and Oscar de la Hoya.

On November 20, 2007, Jose Nunez, manager for [[WBO]] Superfeatherweight Champion [[Joan Guzman]], accused Pacquiao's handler Bob Arum of evading a match between the two boxers to protect Pacquiao.<ref>[http://www.fightnews.com/bates81.htm Boxing News - 24 hours/day - Reload often!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Guzman went as far as to directly call out Pacquiao at the postfight press conference of the Pacquiao-Barrera rematch in front of a stunned crowd at the [[Mandalay Bay]] Events Center's media room in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].<ref>[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/sports/view_article.php?article_id=101833 Guzman beats Soto, wants Pacquiao next - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Super Featherweight title===
On March 15, 2008, in a rematch against [[Juan Manuel Marquez]], Pacquiao won via a highly disputed split decision. Pacquiao won the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' superfeatherweight belts, making him the first Filipino to win three world titles in three different weight divisions (Pacquiao was a former WBC Flyweight Champion, IBF Super bantamweight, and now WBC Super featherweight). The fight was controversial, with some Filipino boxing analysts saying Marquez should have been the winner. 

During the postfight interview, Marquez<U+2019>s camp called for an immediate rematch. Richard Schaefer, GBP CEO, offered a $6-million guarantee to Pacquiao for a rematch. Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum, still stinging from the less-than-stellar revenue from Kelly Pavlik<U+2019>s immediate rematch with Jermain Taylor, said the fight will probably happen but only after there is time to <U+201C>put a little air under it.<U+201D> Pacquiao, for his part, said "I don't think so, this business is over" because he planned to move to lightweight (135 lbs) to challenge [[David Diaz]], the reigning WBC Lightweight Champion at the time. Diaz won a unanimous decision over Ramon Montano that night as an undercard of "Unfinished Business."<ref>

On [[June 28]], [[2008]], at the [[Mandalay Bay]] Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Pacquiao defeated [[David D<U+00ED>az (boxer)|David D<U+00ED>az]] via ninth-round knockout to become the WBC lightweight champion. With the victory, Pacquiao became the only Asian boxer to win four major titles in four weight classes and also became the first Filipino fighter to ever win a world title at lightweight.<ref>http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=16326&more=1</ref><ref>Natividad, Ivan.

Retrieved on [[2008]]-[[07]]-[[04]]</ref>  The fight ended at 2:23 of the ninth round and was viewed by 8,362 spectators. Bob Arum announced that Pacquiao is most likely to fight [[November 15]]<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=124860 abs-cbnnews.com, Nevada says Pacquiao-Valero fight set Nov.15]</ref> versus 130-lb [[Venezuela]]n champion [[Edwin Valero]] or [[Humberto Soto]] in [[Planet Hollywood]], and he also mentioned the name of [[WBA]], [[WBO]], and [[IBF]] lightweight champ [[Nate Campbell]]. "I can fight in November," Pacquiao stated, "Who I fight is the job of my promoter (Bob Arum)." Diaz had his best payday, [[U.S. dollar|$]]850,000, and Pacquiao earned at least $3 million.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=rafael_dan&id=3465794 sports.espn.go.com, All hail the new king]</ref><ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/29/sports/NA-SPT-BOX-Diaz-Pacquiao.php  iht.com, Manny Pacquiao stops David Diaz in 9th round to claim unprecedented fourth title]</ref>

[[Bob Arum]] reported that the Pacquiao-David Diaz fight which made $ 12.5-M (250,000  [[pay-per-view]] hits at $ 49.95 per hit), paled in comparison to the 400,000 in the Marquez showdown. The sales reached over $20 million. Pacquiao<U+2019>s 3 classic fights with [[Erik Morales]] earned a combined sales of 1 million pay-per-view hits. After [[HBO]] and [[Top Rank]] get their share, Pacquiao and Diaz will get theirs based on the contract, that is, in addition to the $ 3 million contract pay. Official records revealed an attendance of only 8,362 tickets of the seating capacity of 12,000, because of rising gasoline costs.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=124390 abs-cbnnews.com, Sales of Pacquiao-Diaz pay-per-view may hit $12.5-M]</ref>

Meanwhile, WBC president Don Jose Sulaiman clarified that Pacquiao is not a 5-division but 4-division world champion, because the November 2003 Barrera fight was a non-title bout.<ref>[http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=14827 boxingscene.com, Sulaiman's position on Pacquio title controversy]</ref>

A few days later, it was announced that he would be the flag bearer of the [[Philippines at the 2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/04/content_8489167.htm "Boxing icon to carry Philippine flag for Beijing Olympics"], Xinhua, July 4, 2008</ref>

==Upcoming fights==
<blockquote>
For his next fight set on Nov. 8, Pacquiao said he prefers to fight British superstar [[Ricky Hatton]] over Venezuelan knockout artist [[Edwin Valero]]. "''Kung ako ang papipiliin ng makakalaban, ang gusto ko si Hatton tapos si Valero.'' (If I'm made to choose for an opponent, I want Hatton first, and then Valero.)"
Like Pacquiao, Roach also wants Hatton next in line as that fight at 140 pounds would be a guaranteed moneymaker, to the tune of at least $10 million for each boxer. Top Rank president Bob Arum, Pacquiao's promoter, however, is keen on having Valero, (24-0 with 24 knockouts) as Pacquiao's next opponent.
''(source:[http://sports.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080704-146515/Pacman-wants-Hatton-first-Valero-next])
([[User:Jongie413|Jongie413]] ([[User talk:Jongie413|talk]]) 05:36, 11 July 2008 (UTC))''</blockquote>

Pacquiao's next fight is set for [[November 15]]. [[Bob Arum]] said: "So November 15th is the preferable date because both [[HBO]] and [[Showtime]] told us they'd rather go with [[pay-per-view]] on the 15th. The venue looks like it will be Planet Hollywood, in the Theater of the Performing Arts. It's beautiful, 7,400 seats, it's sensational. And the overflow can watch in on closed-circuit - 5,000 closed-circuit seats. Pacquiao will face either Edwin Valero or [[Humberto Soto]].

"Whoever offers us the better deal as far as working with us to publicize the fight is going to get it. In other words, as long as we get the use of their assets to promote the fight."<ref>[http://www.maxboxing.com/Kim/Kim071108.asp maxboxing.com, PLANET PACMAN]</ref> Boxing Confidential reported on [[July 11]] that Top Rank Promotions applied to promote the fight card at the [[Planet Hollywood]] in Las Vegas.

The [[World Boxing Council]] gave Pacquiao until [[July 28]] "to decide which between his 2 championships belts he would like to keep." WBC president [[Jose Sulaiman]] issued the statement: <U+201C>If Pacquiao decides to relinquish the lightweight division title and keep the super-featherweight title, [[Humberto Soto]] must fight Pacquiao for the WBC super-featherweight world title, with [[Francisco Lorenzo]] fighting the winner."<ref>[http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id=14949 boxingscene.com, Pacquiao given a deadline]</ref><ref>http://www.gmanews.tv/story/107094/Lightweight-or-not-Pacquiao-given-until-July-28-to-decide gmanews.tv/story, Lightweight or not?

==Politics==
Pacquiao ran for a [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|congressional]] seat to represent the [[Legislative districts of South Cotabato|1st district of South Cotabato]], but he was defeated by Darlene  Antonino-Custodio. Custodio had 139,061 votes, whereas Pacquiao received 75,908 votes.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zonio | first = Aquiles | title = Pacquiao files bid for South Cotabato<U+2019>s Congress seat  | publisher = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 2007-07-29 | url =http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=57725  | accessdate = 2007-04-17 | language = [[English language|English]]}}</ref>

Amidst all the scandals and clamors for the ousting of the president, rumors are ripe that the president herself was the one who pushed for the boxer's candidacy.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Now, Pacquiao himself said he will enter politics after he ends his boxing career. Although boxing is far from over for him, he admitted that he is thinking about starting a career in politics. He quietly visited the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], escorted by [[Ali Atienza|Arnold "Ali" Atienza]] (son of then Manila Mayor [[Lito Atienza]]), to transfer his residence from General Santos City to Manila.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}<!-- what happened to philstar links?<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/philstar/NEWS200608071604.htm Manny transfers residence]</ref> -->  This fueled speculations that he may seek an elective post in the nation's capital, which even gave him the title "Adopted Son" after he won his earlier bouts.

His name was once mentioned as a possible vice-mayoralty candidate to the younger Atienza when the latter sought the city's highest post in the 2007 elections, but this did not pan out after Sen. [[Panfilo Lacson]], then the leading candidate for Manila mayor, did the same after there were contentions regarding residency issues.  (Similarly, Pacquiao also had such issues).

Being known as an Arroyo supporter, his name is also being floated as a candidate of the [[Lakas-CMD]] party for the mayoralty race of [[General Santos City]] against incumbent Mayor Pedro Acharon.  Instead, he was recently sworn-in as a member of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] under the Atienza wing, thus further fueling his political ambition. 

On February 12, 2007, the famed boxer announced that he was running for congress representing South Cotabato.<ref>{{cite news

Aside from that, COMELEC commissioner Benjamin Abalos mentioned a possible legal entanglement could ruin Pacquiao's candidacy because he already registered himself as a Manila resident months before. 

Numerous sports personalities and analysts around the Philippines expressed that Pacquiao should think seriously and deeply about his sports career, which could potentially be destroyed by the dirty world of politics.

On August 1, 2007, Pacquiao filed a P30-million libel suit against four journalists of the [[Manila Bulletin]] - sports writer Nick Giongco, publisher Hermogenes P. Pobre, editor-in-chief Cris J. Icban Jr., and Sports section editor Ding Marcelo. The complaint stemmed from the article "Trouble in Paradise-Again?" written by Giongco and published July 25 in F-2 sports section of the Manila Bulletin. Pacquiao cited the alleged libelous fourth paragraph of the article - "Pacquiao, who spent millions in unsuccessful bid to win a congressional seat in his hometown in General Santos City, is reported to be a compulsive gambler and is known to bet hundreds of thousand in casinos, cockfighting, and billiards."<ref>{{cite news

==Other media==
With his popularity, various business sectors have solicited Manny Pacquiao's help in endorsing their products through commercial advertisements in print and in broadcast media. These include detergents, medicines, foods, garments, telecommunications, and even a political ad for [[Luis Singson|Chavit Singson]] during the [[Philippine general elections, 2007|May 14, 2007 elections]].

On [[April 12]], [[2007]], the COMELEC cancelled his commercial appearances in accordance with existing Philippine election laws. Airing of the commercials resumed after the elections.

In September 2007, he signed up with [[GMA Network]] as an actor.
