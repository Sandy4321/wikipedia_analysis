'''Manzanar''' is most widely known as the site of one of ten camps where over 110,000 [[Japanese American]]s were imprisoned during [[World War II]]. Located at the foot of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]'s [[Owens Valley]] between the towns of [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]] to the south and [[Independence, California|Independence]] to the north, it is approximately {{convert|230|mi|km}} northeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Manzanar (which means <U+201C>apple orchard<U+201D> in Spanish) was identified by the United States [[National Park Service]] as the best-preserved of the former camp sites, and was designated the '''Manzanar National Historic Site'''.<ref name = "NPSHistoryCulture">{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site: History & Culture (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/index.htm | accessdate = April 12, 2007 }}</ref>

Long before the first prisoners arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who mostly lived in villages near several creeks in the area. Ranchers and miners formally established the town of Manzanar in 1910,<ref name = "Chaffey">{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site <U+2013> Orchard Community (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/orchard-community.htm | accessdate = July 26, 2007 }}</ref> but abandoned the town by 1929 after the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]] purchased the water rights to virtually the entire area.<ref name = "NPSHistoryCulture"/> As different as these groups were, their histories displayed a common thread of [[forced relocation]].

Since the last prisoners left in 1945, former prisoners and others have worked to protect Manzanar and to establish it as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]] to preserve and interpret the site for current and future generations. The primary focus is the [[Japanese American Internment]] era,<ref name = "GMP13<U+2013>16">{{cite book | author = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | title = Manzanar National Historic Site: General Management Plan and Environmental Statement | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | pages = 13<U+2013>16 | month = August | year = 1996}}</ref> as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site.

==Terminology==

Dr. James Hirabayashi, Professor Emeritus and former Dean of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]], wrote an article in 1994 in which he stated that he wonders why euphemistic terms used to describe camps such as Manzanar are still being used.

{{quote|Let us review the main points of the debate. Over 120,000 residents of the U.S.A., two thirds of whom were American citizens, were incarcerated under armed guard. There were no crimes committed, no trials, and no convictions: the Japanese Americans were political prisoners. To detain American citizens in a site under armed guard surely constitutes a "concentration camp." But what were the terms used by the government officials who were involved in the process and who had to justify these actions? Raymond Okamura provides us with a detailed list of terms. Let's consider three such euphemisms: "evacuation," "relocation," and "non-aliens." Earthquake and flood victims are evacuated and relocated. The words refer to moving people in order to rescue and protect them from danger.

The official government policy makers consistently used "evacuation" to refer to the forced removal of the Japanese Americans and the sites were called "relocation centers." These are euphemisms (Webster: "the substitution of an inoffensive term for one considered offensively explicit") as the terms do not imply forced removal nor incarceration in enclosures patrolled by armed guards. The masking was intentional.<ref name = "Hirabayashi">{{cite journal | last = Hirabayashi, Ph.D. | first = James | title = "Concentration Camp" or "Relocation Center" <U+2013> What's in a Name? | journal =  Japanese American National Museum Quarterly | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | year = 1994 | url = http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2008/4/24/enduring-communities | accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}</ref>}}

Hirabayashi went on to describe the harm done by the use of such euphemisms and also addressed the issue of whether or not only the Nazi camps can be called "concentration camps."

{{quote|The harm in continuing to use the government's euphemisms is that it disguises or softens the reality which subsequently has been legally recognized as a grave error. The actions abrogated some fundamental principles underlying the Constitution, the very document under which we govern ourselves. This erosion of fundamental rights has consequences for all citizens of our society and we must see that it is never repeated.

Some have argued that the Nazi Germany camps during the Holocaust were concentration camps and to refer to the Japanese American camps likewise would be an affront to the Jews. It is certainly true that the Japanese Americans did not suffer the harsh fate of the Jews in the terrible concentration camps or death camps where Nazi Germany practiced a policy of genocide. Although the loss of life was minimal in America's concentration camps, it does not negate the reality of the unconstitutional incarceration of Japanese American citizens. Michi and Walter Weglyn's research concerning Nazi Germany's euphemisms for their concentration camps revealed such phrases as "protective custody camps," "reception centers," and "transit camps." Ironically, two Nazi euphemisms were identical to our government's usage: "assembly centers" and "relocation centers." It might be well to point out, also, that the Nazis were not operating under the U.S. Constitution. Comparisons usually neglect to point out that Hitler was operating under the rules of the Third Reich. In America all three branches of the U.S. government, ostensibly operating under the U.S. Constitution, ignored the Bill of Rights in order to incarcerate Japanese Americans.<ref name = "Hirabayashi"/>}}

In 1998, use of the term "concentration camps" gained greater credibility prior to the opening of an exhibit about the American camps at [[Ellis Island]]. Initially, the [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC) and the National Park Service, which manages Ellis Island, objected to the use of the term in the exhibit.<ref name = "NYTimes-Debate">{{cite news | last = Sengupta | first = Somini | title = What Is a Concentration Camp?

{{quote|A concentration camp is a place where people are imprisoned not because of any crimes they have committed, but simply because of who they are. Although many groups have been singled out for such persecution throughout history, the term 'concentration camp' was first used at the turn of the century in the [[Spanish-American War|Spanish American]] and [[Boer Wars]]. During World War II, America's concentration camps were clearly distinguishable from Nazi Germany's. Nazi camps were places of torture, barbarous medical experiments and summary executions; some were extermination centers with gas chambers. Six million Jews were slaughtered in the [[Holocaust]]. Many others, including Gypsies, Poles, homosexuals and political dissidents were also victims of the Nazi concentration camps. In recent years, concentration camps have existed in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. Despite differences, all had one thing in common: the people in power removed a minority group from the general population and the rest of society let it happen.<ref name = "JANM-AJC">{{cite press release | title = American Jewish Committee, Japanese American National Museum Issue Joint Statement About Ellis Island Exhibit Set To Open April 3 | publisher = Japanese American National Museum and American Jewish Committee | url = http://www.janm.org/press/release/52 | date = March 13, 1998 | accessdate = December 30, 2007}}</ref><ref name = "NYTAccord">{{cite news | last = Sengupta | first = Somini | title = Accord On Term "Concentration Camp" | publisher = New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/10/nyregion/accord-on-term-concentration-camp.html | date = March 10, 1998 | accessdate = June 13, 2010}}</ref>}}

The Owens Valley had received scant attention from European Americans before the early 1860s, as it was little more than a crossroads of the routes through the area. When gold and silver were discovered in the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains, the resulting sudden influx of miners, farmers, cattlemen and their hungry herds brought conflict with the Owens Valley Paiute, whose crops were being destroyed.<ref name = "MillitaryMuseum">{{cite web | title = California and the Indian Wars: The Owens Valley Indian War, 1861<U+2013>1865 | publisher = The California Military Museum | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/OwensValley.html  | year = 1979 | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}</ref> The Owens Valley Indian War of 1861<U+2013>1863 ensued; at the end the Owens Valley Paiute, along with other native peoples in the region, were forced at gunpoint by the [[United States Army]] to walk almost {{convert|200|mi|km}} to [[Fort Tejon]],<ref name="OWPaiute"/> in one of the many forced relocations or <U+201C>[[Trail of Tears|Trails of Tears]]<U+201D> inflicted upon Native Americans in the United States.<ref name="NAConsultations3<U+2013>4">{{cite book | author = Van Horn, Lawrence F. | title = Native American Consultations and Ethnographic Assessment: The Paiutes and Shoshones of Owens Valley, California | publisher = Western Archaeological and Conservation Center, National Park Service, US Department of the Interior, Denver Service Center | year = 1995 |pages = 3<U+2013>4}}</ref><ref name = "FortTejon">{{cite web | title = Fort Tejon, California | publisher = CivilWarAlbum.com | url = http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc/tejon.htm | date=September 9, 2002 | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}</ref>

In 1920, they began to purchase more of the water rights on the Owens Valley floor.

"When this happened, the children took off their shoes and socks to walk home. In the early 1900s the City of Los Angeles started to purchase ranches in the Owens Valley for the sole purpose of supplying water to the people in Los Angeles. People started to sell their land to the City; the City put in wells to drain the water out of the ground; the trees began to die; and the land finally turned to vacant dirt. This ended the Land of the Big Red Apples.<ref name = "DeBoer"/>}}

After the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States Government swiftly moved to begin solving the <U+201C>[[Japanese people|Japanese]] Problem<U+201D> on the West Coast of the United States.<ref name = "Reflections2">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 2}}</ref>  In the evening hours of that same day, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) arrested selected <U+201C>enemy<U+201D> [[alien (law)|aliens]], including 2,192 who were of Japanese descent.<ref name = "DenshoCauses">{{cite web | title = Densho: Causes of the Incarceration | publisher = Densho | url = http://www.densho.org/causes/default.asp | accessdate = April 17, 2007 }}</ref> The California government pressed for action by the national government, as many citizens were alarmed about potential activities by people of Japanese descent.

On February 19, 1942, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] to designate military commanders to prescribe military areas and to exclude <U+201C>any or all persons<U+201D> from such areas. The order also authorized the construction of what would later be called <U+201C>relocation centers<U+201D> by the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA) to house those who were to be excluded.<ref name = "Reflections3">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 3}}</ref>  This order resulted in the forced relocation of over 120,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of whom were native-born [[United States nationality law|American citizens]].

The Owens Valley Reception Center was transferred to the WRA on June 1, 1942, and officially became the "Manzanar War Relocation Center".

===Climate===
The weather at Manzanar caused suffering for the prisoners, few of whom were accustomed to the extremes of the area's climate. The temporary buildings were not adequate to shield people from the weather. The Owens Valley lies at an elevation of about {{convert|4000|ft|m}}.<ref name = "ManzanarWeather">{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site <U+2013> Weather (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/planyourvisit/weather.htm | date = July 26, 2006 | accessdate = August 4, 2007 }}</ref> Summers on the desert floor of the Owens Valley are generally hot, with temperatures exceeding {{convert|100|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} not uncommon.<ref name = "ManzanarWeather"/>  Winters bring occasional snowfall and daytime temperatures that often drop into the {{convert|40|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} range.<ref name = "ManzanarWeather"/> At night, temperatures are generally 30 to 40&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (17 to 22&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) lower than the daytime highs, and high winds are common day or night.<ref name = "CAE162"/><ref name = "ManzanarWeather"/>  The area's mean annual precipitation is barely five inches (12.7&nbsp;cm). The ever-present dust was a continual problem due to the frequent high winds; so much so that prisoners usually woke up in the morning covered from head to toe with a fine layer of dust, and they constantly had to sweep dirt out of the barracks.<ref name = "Reflections8">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 8}}</ref>

"In the summer, the heat was unbearable," said former Manzanar prisoner Ralph Lazo (''see'' Notable Manzanar prisoners section, below).  "In the winter, the sparsely rationed oil didn't adequately heat the tar paper-covered pine barracks with knotholes in the floor.

===Camp layout and facilities===

The camp site was situated on {{convert|6200|acre|ha}} at Manzanar, leased from the City of Los Angeles,<ref name = "NPSHistoryCulture"/> with the developed portion covering approximately {{convert|540|acre|ha}}.<ref name = "CAE163">{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 163}}</ref> The residential area was about one square mile (2.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), and consisted of 36 blocks of hastily constructed,<ref name = "JAsAtManzanar">{{cite web | title = Manzanar National Historic Site <U+2013> Japanese Americans at Manzanar (U.S. National Park Service) | publisher = National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior  | url = http://www.nps.gov/manz/historyculture/japanese-americans-at-manzanar.htm | accessdate = November 18, 2010 }}</ref> {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tarpaper barracks, with each prisoner family living in a single {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} <U+201C>apartment<U+201D> in the barracks.

<U+201C>...One of the hardest things to endure was the communal latrines, with no partitions; and showers with no stalls,<U+201D> said former Manzanar prisoner Rosie Kakuuchi.<ref name="JAsAtManzanar"/>

Each residential block also had a communal mess hall, a laundry room, a recreation hall, an ironing room, and a heating oil storage tank, although Block 33 lacked a recreation hall.<ref name = "CAE167"/>  In addition to the residential blocks, Manzanar had 34 additional blocks that had staff housing, camp administration offices, two warehouses, a garage, a camp hospital, and 24 firebreaks.<ref name = "CAE163"/>  The camp also had school facilities, a high school auditorium, staff housing, chicken and hog farms, churches, a cemetery, a post office, a cooperative store, other shops, a camp newspaper, and other necessary amenities that one would expect to find in most American cities.<ref name = "Reflections16"/>

Manzanar also had a camouflage net factory, an experimental plantation for producing [[natural rubber]] from the [[Guayule]] plant, and an orphanage called Children's Village, which housed 101 Japanese American orphans.<ref name = "Reflections16"/><ref name = "DenshoManzanar">{{cite web | title = Densho: Sites of Shame: Manzanar | publisher = Densho | url = http://www.densho.org/sitesofshame/facilities.xml | accessdate = April 23, 2007 }}</ref>  The camp perimeter had eight watchtowers manned by armed [[Military Police]], and it was enclosed by five-strand barbed wire.

After being uprooted from their homes and communities, the prisoners found themselves having to endure primitive, sub-standard conditions,<ref name = "JAsAtManzanar"/> and lack of privacy. They had to wait in one line after another for meals, at latrines, and at the laundry room.<ref name = "Reflections7">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 7}}</ref>  Each camp was intended to be self-sufficient, and Manzanar was no exception.

[[File:Mess Hall Line.jpg|thumb|left|Waiting for lunch outside a mess hall at noon July 7, 1942]]

Food at Manzanar was based on military requirements. Meals usually consisted of hot rice and vegetables, since meat was scarce due to [[rationing]].<ref name = "Reflections7"/>  In early 1944, a chicken ranch began operation, and in late April of the same year, the camp opened a hog farm. Both operations provided welcome meat supplements to the prisoners' diet.<ref name = "CAE171">{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 171}}</ref>

Most prisoners were employed at Manzanar to keep the camp running. Unskilled workers earned [[United States dollar|US$]]8 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|8|1942|r=1}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), semi-skilled workers earned $12 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|12|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), skilled workers made $16 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|16|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and professionals earned $19 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|19|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). In addition, all prisoners received $3.60 per month (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3.6|1942|r=0}}}} per month as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) as a clothing allowance.<ref name = "Reflections7"/>

[[File:Ansel Adams, Baseball game at Manzanar, 1943.jpg|thumb|right|A [[baseball]] game at Manzanar, 1943.]]

The prisoners made Manzanar more livable through recreation. They participated in sports, including [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]], and [[martial arts]].<ref name = "Reflections8"/>  They also personalized and beautified their barren surroundings by building elaborate [[Japanese garden|gardens]], which often included pools, waterfalls, and rock ornaments. There was even a nine-hole golf course.<ref name = "Reflections7"/><ref name = "CAE168">{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 168}}</ref>  Remnants of some of the gardens, pools, and rock ornaments are still present at Manzanar.

===Resistance===
Although most prisoners quietly accepted their fate during World War II, there was some resistance in the camps.  [[Poston War Relocation Center|Poston]], [[Heart Mountain War Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]], [[Topaz War Relocation Center|Topaz]], and [[Tule Lake War Relocation Center|Tule Lake]] each had civil disturbances about wage differences, [[black market]]ing of sugar, intergenerational friction, rumors of <U+201C>informers<U+201D> reporting to the camp administration or the FBI, and other issues.<ref name = "Reflections8"/> However, the most serious incident occurred at Manzanar on December 5<U+2013>6, 1942, and became known as the Manzanar Riot.<ref name = "CAE172">{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 172}}</ref>

After several months of tension between prisoners who supported the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] (JACL) and a group of ''[[Kibei]]'' (Japanese Americans educated in Japan), rumors spread that sugar and meat shortages were the result of black marketing by camp administrators.<ref name = "Reflections8"/>  To make matters worse, prisoner and JACL leader Fred Tayama was beaten by six masked men. Harry Ueno, the leader of the Kitchen Workers Union, was suspected of involvement and was arrested and removed from Manzanar.<ref name = "CAE172"/>  Soon after, 3,000 to 4,000 prisoners gathered and marched to the administration area, protesting Ueno's arrest. After Ueno's supporters negotiated with the camp administration, he was returned to the Manzanar jail.<ref name = "CAE172"/>  A crowd of several hundred returned to protest, and when the people surged forward, military police threw [[tear gas]] to disperse them. As people ran to avoid the tear gas, some in the crowd pushed a driverless truck toward the jail. At that moment, the military police fired into the crowd, killing a 17-year<U+2013>old boy instantly. A 21-year<U+2013>old man who was shot in the abdomen died days later. Nine other prisoners were wounded, and a military police corporal was wounded by a ricocheting bullet.<ref name = "Reflections8"/><ref name = "CAE173">{{cite book | author=Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites | page = 173}}</ref>

===Closure===

On November 21, 1945, the [[War Relocation Authority|WRA]] closed Manzanar, the sixth camp to be closed. Although the prisoners had been brought to the Owens Valley by the United States Government, they had to leave the camp and travel to their next destinations on their own.<ref name = "CAE172"/><ref name = "Reflections11">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 11}}</ref>  The WRA gave each person $25 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1945|r=0}}}} today), one-way train or bus fare, and meals to those who had less than $600 (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600|1945|r=0}}}} today).<ref name = "Reflections11"/>  While many left the camp voluntarily, a significant number refused to leave because they had no place to go after having lost everything when they were forcibly uprooted and removed from their homes. As such, they had to be forcibly removed once again, this time from Manzanar. Indeed, those who refused to leave were generally removed from their barracks, sometimes by force, even if they had no place to go.<ref name = "Reflections11"/>

146 prisoners died at Manzanar.<ref name = "IReiTo5">{{cite book | author = Burton, Jeffery F., Haines, Jeremy D., Farrell, Mary M. | title = I Rei To: Archaeological Investigations at the Manzanar Relocation Center Cemetery, Manzanar National Historic Site, California | publisher = Western Archeological and Conservation Center, National Park Service, US Department of the Interior | year = 2001 | id = Publications in Anthropology 79 | page = 5}}</ref>  Fifteen prisoners were buried there, but only five graves remain, as most were later reburied elsewhere by their families.<ref name = "IReiTo18">{{cite book | author = Burton, Haines, Farrell | title = I Rei To: Archeological Investigations at the Manzanar Relocation Center Cemetery, Manzanar National Historic Site, California | page = 18}}</ref>

The Manzanar cemetery site is marked by a monument that was built by prisoner stonemason Ryozo Kado in 1943.<ref name = "Reflections28">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 28}}</ref>  An inscription in Japanese on the front of the monument reads, {{lang|ja|<U+6170><U+9748><U+5854>}} (Soul Consoling Tower).<ref name = "IReiTo5"/> The inscription on the back reads "Erected by the Manzanar Japanese" on the left, and "August 1943" on the right.<ref name = "IReiTo5"/>  Today, the monument is often draped in strings of ''[[origami]]'', and sometimes survivors and other visitors leave offerings of personal items as mementos. The National Park Service periodically collects and catalogues such items.

After the camp was closed, the site eventually returned to its original state. Within a couple of years all the structures had been removed, with the exception of the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the [[Inyo County, California|County of Inyo]]. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], who used it as a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as a maintenance facility by the Inyo County Road Department.<ref name = "CAE172"/><ref name = "Reflections18">{{cite book | author = Manzanar Committee | title = Reflections: Three Self-Guided Tours Of Manzanar | page = 18}}</ref>

As of 2007, the site also retains numerous building foundations, portions of the water and sewer systems, the outline of the road grid, remains of the landscaping constructed by prisoners, and much more.<ref name = "Reflections18"/>  Despite four years of use by the prisoners, the site also retains evidence of the ranches and of the town of Manzanar, as well as artifacts from the days of the Owens Valley Paiute settlement.<ref name = "Reflections19"/><ref name = "CAE173<U+2013>200">{{cite book | author = Burton, Farrell, Lord, Florence B., Lord, Richard W | title = Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Site | pages = 173<U+2013>200}}</ref>

Yoshinaga-Herzig and her husband, John "Jack" Herzig, pored over mountains of documents from the War Relocation Authority, a task that "was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a card catalog that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors."<ref name = "TomFujita"/>  Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1944 cases ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]],'' and ''Yasui v. United States'' which challenged the constitutionality of the relocation and internment.
