"'''Who Says'''" is a song performed by American band [[Selena Gomez & the Scene]]. It was written by [[Priscilla Renea]] and [[Emanuel Kiriakou]], with the latter also producing the track. The song was released on March 14, 2011, as the lead single from the band's upcoming third album, ''[[When the Sun Goes Down (Selena Gomez & the Scene album)|When the Sun Goes Down]]''. At first Gomez intended to wait until the release of the band's third album, but wanted to put the album together after hearing "Who Says." 

The song follows a succession of several self-empowerment anthems released around the same time, including "[[Firework (Katy Perry song)|Firework]]", [[We R Who We R]] and "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]." According to Gomez, the song was intended to inspire people, and fire back at the "haters", particularly those involved in [[cyberbullying]]. Several critics said that Gomez alluded to the hate she received online, specifically on [[Twitter]], after she began dating singer [[Justin Bieber]]. "Who Says" marks a distinct departure in sound for the band, as it has an acoustic and organic feel, compared to their dance-pop and club-oriented previous singles. The song is a [[teen pop]] number with inspirational lyrics about embracing yourself and not letting anyone bring you down. 

"Who Says" received generally positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its message and the change of pace for the band. The song charted in the top thirty in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, and it either became their highest charting single on these charts, or matched their previous peak. It also reached the lower regions of numerous other European charts. "Who Says" was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The song's music video features Gomez frolicing around a city, removing makeup, and performing with the band on a beach. Gomez & the Scene performed the song numerous times, including on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 12)|the twelfth season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[So Random!]]''.

==Background and inspiration==
[[File:DSC00942.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Due to comments made by Gomez, critics said that the song's inspiration was partly due to the attention she received with boyfriend Justin Bieber ''(pictured)''.]]
In 2009, the band released their debut album, ''[[Kiss & Tell (Selena Gomez & the Scene album)|Kiss & Tell]]'', and quickly followed-up with 2010's ''[[A Year Without Rain]]''.<ref name="Vena2"/> After the release of the latter Gomez said that she was not in a rush to release another album, but after hearing "Who Says", she decided to begin another release, calling the song "amazing" and crediting it for inspiring her.<ref name="Vena2"/> Gomez would later call the song "fun and empowering," commenting "Every time I sing this song, I'm like, 'I feel better already!"<ref name="Vena2"/> When talking about the song's message, Gomez commented that she thought of it as "sweet," going on to say, "with bullying, with cyberbullying, with all the negativity that is in high school and dealing with things, you're already trying to figure out who you are; it doesn't help when people are constantly trying to tear you down."<ref name="Vena2"/> She then said that she was "dealing with it, of course" and was "going through it as well."<ref name="Vena2"/> After debuting the single on ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'', Gomez mentioned the criticism received on Twitter and Facebook due to being a celebrity, and critics such as Nardine Saad of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' inferred this as firing back at the hate received after she started dating Canadian recording artist [[Justin Bieber]] earlier in the year.<ref name="Saad">{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/03/selena-gomez-new-song-who-says-justin-bieber.html|title=Selena Gomez debuts song 'Who Says,' misses Justin Bieber|first=Nardine|last=Saad|accessdate=2011-05-30|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

The song is a departure in her previous singles such as "[[Round & Round (Selena Gomez & the Scene song)|Round & Round]]" and "[[Naturally (Selena Gomez & the Scene song)|Naturally]]", as in whereas the previous were [[dance-pop]] and club-oriented, "Who Says" draws from the [[teen pop]] genre, and has an "organic" and "acoustic" feel.<ref name="Vena1"/> According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing Co., Inc., "Who Says" is set in common time in a "moderate" tempo of 100 beats per minute.

According to Brian Voerding of [[AOL Music|AOL Radio Blog]], "Gomez sings about staying true to herself, particularly in the face of doubt that comes from others telling her she can't live up to her dreams." In the song she refers to her criticisms as "the price of beauty."<ref name="Voerding">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2011/03/08/selena-gomez-who-says/|title=Selena Gomez & the Scene, 'Who Says' -- New Song|work=''[[AOL Music|AOL Radio Blog]]''|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=2011-03-17|date=2011-03-08|first=Brian|last=Voerding}}</ref> Bill Lamb of About.com said the song's positive message is "all about recognizing yourself as a beautiful person despite what others might say or think."<ref name="Lamb"/>

===Critical reception===
Jocelyn Vena of [[MTV News]] complimented the song, commenting that "[[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] has a new empowerment anthem."<ref name="Vena1"/> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] said Gomez "has become the most consistent Disney pop hitmaker in recent years" and that "she has not reached these achievements through gimmickry or pandering to an audience. She has succeeded with quality, straightforward pop songs."<ref name="Lamb"/> Lamb went on to say that "Who Says" was no exception, complimenting Gomez's "winning vocals," and the song's "bright, catchy instrumental arrangement" and the "irresistible chorus."<ref name="Lamb"/> However, Lamb commented that the song was lacking in originality, and said that it was another pop song with a theme of self-esteem.<ref name="Lamb"/> Although a writer from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' called the song "superfluous" and like many feel-good anthems, "a little bit tepid," the writer said it was "cute" and an "ode to self worth" which "exudes bubblegum confidence in the manner of her man (boy) Bieber's tune "[[Never Say Never (Justin Bieber song)|Never Say Never]].'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/09/selena-gomez-releases-new_n_833705.html|title=Selena Gomez Releases New Single 'Who Says?'
