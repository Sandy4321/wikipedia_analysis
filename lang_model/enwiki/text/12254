'''George Adamski''' ([[April 17]], [[1891]] <U+2013> [[April 23]], [[1965]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-born [[United States|American]] who claimed to have seen and photographed ships from other [[planets]], met people from other planets (whom he called "[[Space Brothers]]"), and to have gone on flights with them.  He considered himself to be a "philosopher, teacher, student and saucer researcher." <ref name="tm1">{{cite web| title =The Queen & the Saucers| publisher =Time (magazine)| date =June 1, 1959| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811123,00.html| accessdate =2007-04-27}}</ref>

== Early years ==
Adamski was born on [[April 17]], [[1891]] in [[Poland]]. <ref name="sosd1">{{cite web| last =Scott-Blair| first =Michael| title =UFO pioneer inspires site's astronomy theme| publisher =Sign On San Diego|date=August 13, 2003| url =http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20030813-9999_7m13ufo.html| accessdate =2007-04-27  }}</ref>  At the age of 2, Adamski and his family emigrated from Poland to [[New York City]]. <ref name="sosd1" />  He and his parents claimed they were contacted by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]  when Adamski was very young, which led to his lecturing on the "cosmic philosophy" of ETs.  At the age of 22 <ref name="ps1">{{cite book| last =Solomon| first =Professor| title =How to Make the Most of a Flying Saucer Experience  | publisher =Top Hat Press| date =1998| location =Baltimore| pages =54-56 | chapter =It Can Happen to Anyone | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oyE5I4afNhoC&dq=George+Adamski&as_brr=1| doi =| id = | isbn = ISBN 978-0-91-250907-5}}</ref>, from 1913 to 1916, he was a soldier in the 13th [[United States Cavalry|US Cavalry]] Regiment K-Troop fighting at the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. <ref name="sosd1" />  In 1917, he married. <ref name="ps1" />  Adamski then moved west, working as a maintenance worker in [[Yellowstone National Park]], as a worker in an Oregon [[flour mill]]. <ref name="sosd1" />  While in [[w:Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], Adamski founded the "Royal Order of Tibet," which held its meetings in the "Temple of Scientific Philosophy." <ref name="ps1" />  In 1940, Adamski and some close friends of his moved to a ranch near [[California]]'s [[Palomar Mountain]] where they dedicated their time to studying and farming. <ref name="ps1" />   In 1944, with funding from Mrs. Alice K. Wells - a student of Adamski - they purchased 20 acres of land on Palomar Mountain, where they built a new home called Palomar Garden and a new restaurant called Palomar Gardens Cafe. <ref name="ps1" /><ref name="sosd1" /><ref name="tm1" />

== Alleged encounters ==
On [[October 9]], [[1946]], during a [[meteor shower]] , Adamski and some friends said that while they were at the Palomar Gardens' campground, they witnessed a large cigar-shaped "mother ship." <ref name="sosd1" />  In 1947, Adamski took a photograph of the 1946 cigar-shaped "mother ship" crossing in front of the moon over Palomar Gardens. <ref name="sosd1" />  On [[May 29]], [[1950]], Adamski reported that he had photographed six UFOs flying in formation.<ref name="sosd1" />

[[Image:George Adamski ship 1.jpg|right|thumb|Adamski's UFO photograph taken on [[December 13]], [[1952]] using his 6-inch telescope.]]
On [[November 20]], [[1952]] Adamski and several friends were in the [[Colorado Desert]] near [[Desert Center]], [[California]] when they saw a large submarine-shaped object hovering in the sky. Adamski said he believed that the ship was looking for him, so he left the group and went away from the main road. He claimed that a scout ship, made of a type of translucent metal, landed nearby. Adamski claimed that there he meet a [[Venusian]] called Orthon.  <ref name="tcu1">{{cite web| title =Common sense abducted| publisher =Telegraph.co.uk| date =March 6, 2005|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/03/06/boapp206.xml&site=6| accessdate =2007-04-27}}</ref>  He described Orthon as a medium height [[humanoid]] having long-blond hair, a [[Tan (color)|tan]] skin color, and wearing reddish-brown shoes with a trouser: "his trousers were not like mine". <ref name="sosd1" /><ref name="tcu1" /><ref name="tm2" /><ref name="s1">Colin Groves in ''Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, ISBN 0731657942, p3</ref>  During their contact, Adamski said they communicated [[telepathy|telepathically]] and through hand signals. <ref name="tm2" /><ref name="s1" /><ref name="tcu1" />  During their conversation, Orthon talked about the dangers of nuclear war and arranged for Adamski to be taken on a trip to see the [[Solar System|solar system]] including the planet [[Venus]], the location where Mrs. Adamski had been [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]]. <ref name="sosd1" /><ref name="tcu1" />  Adamski said that Orthon had refused to have a photograph of himself taken, but instead requested Adamski provide him with a photographic plate, which Orthon received three weeks later. <ref name="sosd1" />  On [[December 13]], [[1952]], Orthon returned the photographic plate to Adamski containing new strange symbols, and it was during this meeting that Adamski took his famous UFO photograph using his 6-inch telescope. <ref name="sosd1" /><ref name="p1">{{cite web| title =George Adamski and the Flying Saucers from Venus| url =http://www.algonet.se/~hermesat/adamski.htm| accessdate =2007-04-27}}</ref>

Adamski claimed that he and George Hunt Williamson were able to take plaster casts of what he claimed were the Orthons footprints from the [[November 20]], [[1952]] meeting, and that the prints contained mysterious symbols. [[Ufology|Ufologists]] claim some of these casts are located today at [[Castle Leslie]] in [[Ireland]] but no evidence of this has been produced.  Several Adamski supporters <U+2014> Alice Wells, Lucy McGinnis, Alfred & Betty Bailey, and [[George Hunt Williamson|George & Betty Hunt Williamson]] <U+2014> later signed an affidavit claiming to have witnessed the event.

In 1954, [[Desmond Leslie]] witnessed several UFOs with Adamski while visiting Adamski in California, and described one of them in a letter he sent to his wife while he was in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]: <ref name="tcu2">{{cite web | title =Desmond Leslie| publisher =Telegraph.co.uk | date =November 22, 2001 | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/03/20/db02.xml| accessdate =2007-04-27}}</ref>

In May 1959, Adamski received a letter from the lady head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society informing him that she had been contacted by Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]]'s palace and "that the Queen would like to receive you." <ref name="tm1" />  Adamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her meeting with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the meeting saying that, "A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests." <ref name="tm1" />  After the meeting, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said, "The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject." <ref name="tm1" />

Adamski later claimed to have met other people from other planets (mostly from Venus but also from [[Mars]] and [[Saturn]]) and said he was taken on flights by them, including one around to the back side of the Moon where he saw cities, UFO landing strips, and mountains covered with trees and snow.

Adamski said that the 1959 photographs, taken by the Soviet lunar probe [[Luna 3]], of the [[far side of the Moon]] were fake, and that instead there were cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains there. <ref name="nro1">{{cite web| last =Stuttaford| first =Andrew| title =Spirits in the Sky| publisher =National Review Online| date =January 17, 2003| url=http://www.nationalreview.com/script/printpage.p?ref=/stuttaford/stuttaford011703.asp| accessdate = 2007-04-27}}</ref>  Adamski also claimed that he had a secret meeting with [[Pope John XXIII]]. <ref name="nro1" />  Adamski, at the request of the extraterrestrials he was in contact with, left for a meeting with the Pope where Adamski was to request a "final agreement" with the Pope because of the Pope's decision not to communicate directly with any extraterrestrials, and also to provide the Pope with a liquid substance in order to save the Pope from gastric [[enteritis]] that he suffered from, which would later become acute [[peritonitis]]. <ref>{{cite web| last =Barbato| first =Cristoforo| title =The Omega Secret| publisher =UFO Digest| date =2006| url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/1206/omegasecret3.html | accessdate =2007-04-30}}</ref>

In 1962, Adamski's reputation began to decline after he announced that he would be going to a conference on the planet [[Saturn]]. <ref name="sosd1" />  On [[April 23]], [[1965]] at the age of 74, Adamski died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Maryland]]. <ref name="sosd1" />
