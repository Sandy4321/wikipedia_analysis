'''Rosario Strait''' is a [[strait]] in northern [[Washington|Washington state]], separating [[Island County, Washington|Island]] and [[San Juan County, Washington|San Juan Counties]]. It extends from the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] about {{convert|23|km|mi}} north to the [[Strait of Georgia]]. The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] defines its southern boundary as a line extending from Point Colville on [[Lopez Island]] to Rosario Head on [[Fidalgo Island]], and its northern boundary as a line from Point Migley on [[Lummi Island]] to the east tip of Puffin Island (just east of [[Matia Island]]) and then to Point Thompson on [[Orcas Island]]. Rosario Strait runs north-south between [[Lopez Island|Lopez]], [[Decatur Island|Decatur]], [[Blakely Island, Washington|Blakely]], and [[Orcas Island|Orcas]] Islands on the west, and  [[Fidalgo Island|Fidalgo]], Bypress, [[Sinclair Island (Washington)|Sinclair]], and [[Lummi Island|Lummi]] Islands on the east.<ref>{{gnis|1507915|Rosario Strait}}</ref>

==History==
In 1791 the Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Eliza]] gave the name ''Gran Canal de Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora del Rosario la Marinera'' to what it now the [[Strait of Georgia]]. He named today's Rosario Strait ''Boca de Fidalgo''. In 1792, [[George Vancouver]] explored the region and gave the Strait of Georgia its present name. He did not provide a name for Rosario Strait. In 1847 [[Charles Wilkes]], during the [[United States Exploring Expedition|Wilkes Expedition]], gave Rosario Strait the name ''Ringgold Channel'' after one of his officers. Then in 1847 the British Captain [[Henry Kellett]] reorganized the British Admiralty charts, in the process removing the "pro-American" names given by Wilkes and affirming pro-British names and Spanish names. He affirmed the name ''Gulf of Georgia'' (Strait of Georgia) given by [[George Vancouver]] and used a shortened version of Eliza's name for the Strait of Georgia to replace both Wilkes' and Eliza's original names for Rosario Strait.<ref>{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}</ref>

Following the Oregon Treaty it was assumed by the British to be the route of the deepest channel to the open sea from the 49th Parallel boundary's terminus in the middle of the [[Georgia Strait]], and is in fact the shortest shipping route.  Haro Strait, west of the San Juan Islands, which is wider though somewhat longer, was the American preference for the boundary and its eventual location following the arbitration of the dispute over the San Juan Islands, known as the [[Pig War]].
