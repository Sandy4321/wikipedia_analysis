A '''pidgin''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|p|<U+026A>|d<U+0292>|<U+026A>|n}}), or '''pidgin language''', is a simplified language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. It is most commonly employed in situations such as [[trade]], or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between groups of people.  A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language.<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Todd|1990|p=3}}</ref><ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=169}}</ref> A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures.  Pidgins usually have low [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] with respect to other languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p= 27}}</ref>

Not all simplified or "broken" forms of a language are pidgins. Each pidgin has its own norms of usage which must be learned for proficiency in the pidgin.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p=26}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word ''pidgin'' is uncertain. ''Pidgin'' first appeared in print in 1850 and there are many sources to which the word may be attributed. For example:
* The [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] pronunciation of the English word ''business''.<ref name=etymonline>{{citation | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pidgin}}</ref>
* English ''[[pigeon]]'', a bird sometimes used for [[messenger pigeon|carrying brief written messages]], especially in times prior to modern telecommunications.<ref>{{Citation |title=pidgin|encyclopedia= ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1997}}</ref>

== Terminology ==
The word ''pidgin'', formerly also spelled ''pigion'',<ref name=etymonline/> originally used to describe [[Chinese Pidgin English]], was later generalized to refer to any pidgin.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|p=25}}</ref> ''Pidgin'' may also be used as the specific name for local pidgins or [[Creole language|creole]]s, in places where they are spoken. For example, the name of the creole language [[Tok Pisin]] derives from the English words ''talk pidgin''.  Its speakers usually refer to it simply as "pidgin" when speaking English.<ref>Smith, Geoff P. Growing Up with Tok Pisin: Contact, creolization, and change in Papua New Guinea's national language. London: Battlebridge. 2002. p. 4</ref><ref>Thus the published court reports of Papua New Guinea refer to Tok Pisin as "Pidgin": see for example Schubert v The State [1979] PNGLR 66.</ref> Likewise, [[Hawaiian Creole English]] is commonly referred to by its speakers as "Pidgin".

The term ''[[jargon]]'' has also been used to describe pidgins, and is found in the names of some pidgins, such as [[Chinook Jargon]]. In this context, linguists today use ''jargon'' to denote a particularly rudimentary type of pidgin;<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bakker|1994|pp25<U+2013>26}}</ref> however, this usage is rather rare, and the term ''jargon'' most often refers to the words particular to a given profession.

Pidgins may start out as or become trade languages, such as [[Tok Pisin]].  Trade languages are often full blown languages in their own right such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Trade languages tend to be "vehicular languages", while pidgins can evolve into the [[vernacular]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

== Common traits among pidgin languages ==
Since a pidgin language is a fundamentally simpler form of communication, the [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] are usually as simple as possible, and usually consist of:{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

* Uncomplicated [[clause|clausal]] structure (e.g., no [[subordinate clause|embedded]] clauses, etc.)
* Reduction or elimination of [[syllable coda]]s
* Reduction of consonant clusters or breaking them with [[epenthesis]]
* Basic vowels, such as {{IPA|[a, e, i, o, u]}}
* No [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], such as those found in West African and Asian languages
* Use of separate words to indicate [[Grammatical tense|tense]], usually preceding the [[verb]]
* Use of [[reduplication]] to represent [[plurals]], [[superlatives]], and other parts of speech that represent the concept being increased
* A lack of [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic variation]]

== Pidgin development ==
The creation of a pidgin usually requires:
* Prolonged, regular contact between the different language communities
* A need to communicate between them
* An absence of (or absence of widespread proficiency in) a widespread, accessible [[interlanguage]]

Also, Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others.

It is often posited that pidgins become [[creole language]]s when a generation of children learn a pidgin as their first language, a process that regularizes speaker-dependent variation in grammar.  Creoles can then replace the existing mix of languages to become the native language of a community (such as the [[Chavacano language]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Sierra Leone Krio language|Krio]] in [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Tok Pisin]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]).  However, not all pidgins become creole languages; a pidgin may die out before this phase would occur (e.g. the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]]).

Other scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged among trade colonies among "users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions". Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |title=Salikoko Mufwene: "Pidgin and Creole Languages" |publisher=Humanities.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>
