'''"Nous les amoureux"''' ("We lovers") was the winning [[song]] of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]], performed in [[French Language|French]] for [[Luxembourg]] by [[Jean-Claude Pascal]].

The song is a return to the more serious style of entry, with Pascal singing about himself and another (rumoured to be another man) who others want to separate. He sings, however, that "Heaven is with us lovers", a declaration of hope in spite of the difficulties.

The song was performed fourteenth on the night (following [[Denmark]]'s [[Dario Campeotto]] with "[[Angelique (song)|Angelique]]" and preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Allisons|The Allisons]] with "Are You Sure?"). By the close of voting, it had received 31 points, placing it first in a field of 16 and thus helping Luxembourg to achieve the rare feat of moving from last to first in successive years.

The song was succeeded as contest winner in 1962 by [[Isabelle Aubret]] singing "[[Un premier amour]]" for [[France]].

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1962|1962 Contest]] by [[Camillo Felgen]] with "[[Petit bonhomme]]".
