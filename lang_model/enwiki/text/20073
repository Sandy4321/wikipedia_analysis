He investigates the possibilities of the culprit being whirlpools or crocodiles, but determines neither fit. Wade eventually finds out of a little-known catfish species that can grow to  a large size: the Goonch, or Giant Devil Catfish. He reasons that, since funeral pyres are done at the shore of the river, the fish feed off the burnt human remains. This would allow them to reach man-eating size, as well as giving them a taste of people. Jeremy then must face off against a large goonch which may prove there are monster goonch ready to eat people. When going after this fish Jeremy spends weeks trying to catch the goonch, but the time eventually came when he had to take a risk and catch this elusive fish

The Amazon has many river monsters. Anacondas, Caimans, Piranha, and Jaguars all call this place home. Years ago, Jeremy Wade traveled here looking for Arapaima: a 10 foot long fish that has been known to ram predators with the force of a car crash. The trip resulted in Jeremy feeling the full force of one of these blows. Now, Wade has returned to Brazil to once again face off against this fish and determine if the Arapaima deserves to be on the Amazon's already large list of monsters. Journeying to the few spots where fishing for these fish is allowed, he encounters an Arapaima farm where the fish do something surprising. Jeremy then hears stories of the Amazon's other killers, the caiman. He searches for these, as well as a mysterious legend with its roots buried deep in folklore. Then, after finding the perfect spot, he finally comes face to face with the legendary giant, whose body could become a living missile.

He finds the Candiru, a small blood-sucking catfish that has entered a man's body in the most horrifying of places, and the Candiru-Ac<U+00F9>, a small catfish that swarms around and drills holes in dead or dying animals (including humans), eating them from the inside.

Jeremy Wade follows reports of attacks in rivers to Australia to find out why and how far these fish swim upstream. He traces the trail of blood left by these monsters from bays to lagoons to rivers, until he finally zeros in on the lair of these sea monsters. While fishing for one, Wade finds something even more shocking and terrifying than a full grown shark.

Jeremy Wade travels deep into the jungles of the Congo in search of a little-known predator that may be the most terrifying monster of all: the Goliath Tigerfish. This creature combines everything that made all previous river monsters deadly, and then some. Growing to 6 feet long with the jaws and teeth of a crocodile, this beast is covered in armor plating and thick muscle. Basically a giant piranha, the tigerfish is believed to be responsible for gruesome deaths, both in and out of water. The  search for the elusive tigerfish pushes Jeremy to his mental limit as he uses everything he knows as a fisherman, as well as some luck from a witch doctor, to find this terrifying monster and uncover the truth behind a number of violent attacks.

Unlike South American freshwater stingrays (which usually don't get very big and deadly), this creature is a true monster. As this behemoth can nearly glue itself to the bottom of the river, once Jeremy hooks one, it may be his biggest challenge yet.

Journeying to Florida, Jeremy Wade encounters the Bullseye Snakehead, which were introduced to the state from Southeast Asia. With razor-sharp teeth and the abilities to breathe air and "walk" on land, these aggressive predators soon spawned numerous rumors of being man-eaters. Proving to be incredibly violent and vicious, Wade gets to the bottom of their monstrous rumors, only to be unconvinced of their lethality. That is, until he learns of another species, the Giant Snakehead, which is reported to be the largest and most dangerous of the snakeheads. Meanwhile, he travels up to [[Illinois]] and gets a taste of how much of an impact an invasive species such as the [[silver carp]] can have on humans. Arriving at [[Vajiralongkorn Dam|Khao Laem Dam]] along the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]] in Thailand, Wade uncovers stories of attacks, one being fatal. With no luck in reeling one in with a line, he then dives deep into a murky river right in the middle of a school of young snakehead, hoping to find their murderous parents.

Now he's back, investigating reports of fishermen being dragged to their death by a malevolent river spirit. Wade suspects the Tsuni catfish, Vundu Catfish or the Kamba Catfish, which are known to grow to large sizes. While staying with local villagers, he faces their superstitious beliefs as they blame his arrival for the disappearance of the chief's brother. After using traditional Congolese fishing methods, hearing of how one fisherman died, and finally facing a Catfish, Jeremy begins to wonder if the real danger isn't the fish itself.

Investigating the identity of this creature, Jeremy Wade faces cold-water fishing for the first time. He investigates the possibility of the monster being a Pike or a Beluga whale, but none would match the description. Wade then tries to find out a possible food source: Salmon. This results in the first salmon he has on the end of his line, only to have it stolen by a bear. After hearing an eyewitness' encounter, Jeremy is able to determine the identity of the monster: a White Sturgeon. These fish grow to 20 feet long and are known to leap out of the water, which could result in people going missing. Fishing for sturgeon, Wade faces what may be the biggest fish he's ever caught.

One year ago, Jeremy Wade was investigating the Bull Shark in Australia and caught a small pup, proving that the sharks were breeding in the local rivers. Around the same time, a group of scientists in South Africa made a shocking discovery: the largest Bull Shark ever caught, and it was found in a river. Now the team is back, and they've brought Jeremy with them in hopes of finding out if this was a horrifying fluke, or if the sharks have made the river their homes. Jeremy discovers that the largely populated river is full of sharks, yet nobody has ever been attacked. Wade realizes the reason why these fish are in this river as well as why there have been no attacks, and lands two of his biggest catches yet.

Jeremy Wade travels to this unexplored river to uncover the creature responsible. While fishing for a possible food source, Wade makes an unusual discovery: a Pacu. These fish are related to the Piranha and are from South America, where they use their strange human-like teeth to eat nuts and fruits.

Captain [[James Cook]]'s memoirs and [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] folklore's tell of man-eating snake-like creatures. He treks into the [[Waitomo Caves]] and [[Lake Manapouri]] and discovers just how savage and dangerous these "devourers of men" can be. Armed with razor-sharp teeth which prevent escape, these eels spin and tear off bits of flesh like a crocodile. Although he already knows they have the ability to cause serious harm, Wade still must determine if they have the attitude to attack a human in order to find out if they deserve their reputation. The only way to do this is to put himself on the menu.

Venturing to a country he's never been to before, to face a fish he's never heard of before, Jeremy travels to this river in order to find the killer: the Shorttail River Stingray, which grows to 6 feet across.  Unlike Thailand's Giant Freshwater Stingray, this fish isn't long or wide. Instead it is thick and heavy, with a short, clublike tail with which it delivers its venomous sting. After hearing many more reports of attacks, Jeremy becomes determined to face this beast, which can glue itself to the river bottom like a suction cup. Its strength is then proven as Wade hooks into this tank-like fish in what is his longest battle to date.

25 years ago, Jeremy Wade was in a hardware store in the Amazon when he came across a weapon more sinister than any he had seen before. It was a yard long and studded on each side with 2 inch long teeth. This strange weapon was the snout of a Sawfish: a 20-foot relative of the rays which has been known to swim hundreds of miles upriver. Reports claim this shark-like fish hacks boats apart and saws people in half, feasting on their flesh. Wade travels to the Fitzroy River in Australia in order to find out if this critically endangered creature deserves its reputation as a river monster and why it swims so far up rivers. After being plagued by crocodiles and sharks, (which, ironically, he had previously traveled to Australia to find, yet didn't catch one for weeks) Wade hooks into this bladed beast and reels in a 7-foot monster. The episode is dedicated in memory of wildlife expert Malcolm Douglas, who died in a car accident shortly after filming.

Jeremy Wade returns to the Amazon to search for a mysterious and deadly killer with a reputation to match its awesome ability. Hearing the stories of three cowboys in [[Par<U+00E1>]] dying at the same time without any bite marks on them, he rules out piranhas and stingrays. After hearing a witness' claim, he concludes that the killer was an Electric Eel: an 8-foot, snake-like fish that possesses the bizarre ability to produce up to 600 volts of electricity. Following stories of "invisible powers", he journeys all over Brazil, searching for the elusive fish. Jeremy then comes across a story that confirms the eel's ability to kill a man, but he still tries to find out if it can kill three as the story claims. After searching through the smallest of ponds he can find in the dry season, he finally finds a large eel in little more than a mud-puddle. After fishing it out, Wade makes a  startling discovery that could possibly explain three men dying at once.

For the first time in his life, Jeremy Wade travels to [[Japan]] to learn more about its legendary river monsters. In a Tokyo fish market, he interviews many fisherman and uncovers two seemingly unbelievable stories: the [[Namazu (Japanese mythology)|Namazu]], an enormous catfish that supposedly causes the numerous earthquakes in Japan whenever it wriggles its huge body; and the [[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]], a gremlin-like beast that drags children underwater and devours their souls. On [[Lake Biwa]], Wade investigates the origin of the namazu legend as well as searches for a connection between catfish and earthquakes. After finding a reasonable explanation, he turns his attention to the Kappa. After visiting a shrine to the creature, he finds an alleged mummified kappa and starts wondering if the kappa isn't a fish, but something else entirely. Wade speaks with a scientist about what other creatures live in Japanese rivers, and he learns of a creature known as the ''[[Hanzaki]]'', which can grow to 6 feet. Diving into a swift-moving stream, Jeremy comes face-to-face with the strangest and most unexpected river monster he's ever met.

Everyone knows the piranha is the deadliest fish in South America, but is there a little-known fish that is even more vicious and aggressive than the supposed "flesh-eating piranha"? After receiving a report of a diver being brutally attacked, Jeremy Wade travels to [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] in the remote jungles of [[Suriname]], where he interviews the victim and hears his idea of the culprit. The man claims the fish was the much-feared "[[anjumara]]", a Wolf Fish: a large, aggressive predator with razor-sharp teeth. Wade travels deep into the jungle in search of a monster fish and uncovers more reports of their savagery, attacking people and animals on both land and sea. After a "shocking" event and a plague of piranha and caiman, Jeremy comes face-to-face with what is perhaps South America's most vicious fish.

Jeremy Wade has travelled all over the world looking for killer freshwater fish. He has been down the Amazon, deep in the heart of Africa, in the murkiest swamps, in the Alaskan subarctic, and everywhere in between. But are there dangerous killers lurking in the lakes and rivers of the United States? Travelling to Florida, Jeremy once again encounters the bull shark, a species known to swim in freshwater, which he has faced before in Australia and South Africa. Bull sharks are believed to have been responsible for the [[Jersey Shore Shark Attacks of 1916]], which inspired the 1974 novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Three of the five attacks that occurred took place in a freshwater river. Following reports of sharks prowling the freshwater canals of Florida, Jeremy once again reels in a monster shark, as well as a little extra.

Next, Wade returns to Texas' [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], for a rematch with the alligator gar. In season 1, he had caught a 7-foot female gar and concluded that the fish had no interest in attacking people. Now, reports have surfaced that gar in Texas are once again reaching lengths of up to 14 feet, the perfect size for a potential killer. Having already experienced their impenetrable armour and razor sharp teeth, Jeremy follows reports of giant gar all over the Trinity, only to find possible evidence of giant gar in a very unexpected place.

Then, Jeremy turns his attention to the [[Lake of the Ozarks]], America's 3rd most dangerous lake, to investigate stories of catfish growing to man-eating proportions. Local divers have allegedly witnessed giant catfish and been too scared to dive in the lake again. Jeremy uncovers unbelievable stories of catfish eating already deceased humans, but he wonders if a catfish could ever be big enough or strong enough to kill a person. He finds his answer in [[Oklahoma]], where people catch catfish in a very unusual and dangerous method.

In the [[Okavango River]] delta in [[Botswana]], a ferry tips over. All the passengers die, and their bodies are retrieved stripped of flesh. Authorities write it off as crocodiles, but Jeremy Wade isn't so sure. The corpse resemble those devoured by piranha and beggars the question if this was another case of an [[introduced species]] running amok. Travelling to the murky swamps of the delta, he is informed of a fish known locally as the ''[[ndweshi]]'', which swarms in packs and is greatly feared. Described as long and muscular, with large teeth and horizontal black stripes, Jeremy goes hunting for a fish to match the description. Following a flock of birds, he finds a group of large predatory fish causing a commotion in the water. Casting out, he lands an African Tigerfish, a smaller cousin of the Goliath Tigerfish he caught in season 2. Believing to have found the ''ndweshi'', he tries to discover if they really are pack-hunting killers. Hearing of a rare event believed to attract large numbers of tigerfish, Wade sets out only to find himself in the middle of a feeding frenzy.

After hearing reports of fishermen disappearing in the [[Zambezi River]] in [[Zambia]], Jeremy Wade journeys there to uncover the truth behind their deaths. He hears tales of a man getting pulled in and drowning in the rapids after hooking into a monster fish. The natives believe it to be the work of a large, serpentine fish the size of a man. They also tell Wade of a snakelike river spirit called ''[[The legend of Nyaminyami|Nyaminyami]]'', who is angry at the [[Kariba Dam]] for blocking its river. Believing Nyaminyami to be inspired from the killer fish, he travels to Lake Kariba to find the beast. After nearly being capsized in a storm, Jeremy hears reports of small toddlers and children being eaten by the fish, known locally as "Mazunda," as well as a fisherman being dragged to the depths beneath the dam. Interviewing a witness of the "Mazunda," Wade learns of the Vundu Catfish, southern Africa's largest fish. Travelling all over the Zambezi, Jeremy gains access to the prohibited waters directly beneath the dam, where he finally hooks into a monster.

Note* The Vundu catfish was also featured in the Season 2 episode "Congo Killers," no mention was made in this episode of ever having caught it before.

Jeremy Wade's journey into extreme fishing started in India, where he caught large Mahseer, and where he later caught a massive [[Bagarius bagarius|Goonch]] that had been killing bathers. Now, he returns following reports of a new predator, capable of taking pets and small children. Looking around, he uncovers its identity: the Sareng Catfish, a streamlined predator with long jaws and sharp teeth. He also finds a problem: the sareng is sacred in India's Hindu religion and harming it is believed to curse you with bad luck. Almost immediately he encounters problems when the lake where he is fishing is closed and tries his luck in the wilderness of [[Corbett National Park]], sharing the territory with man-eating tigers and wild elephants. The [[monsoon]] comes early and the fish are not biting, forcing him to leave the river. In order to escape what appears to be the wrath of the gods, he travels to Thailand to a lake inhabited by sareng, as well as countless other introduced river monsters. Despite not being a Hindu country, Thailand offers no protection from the gods as Jeremy seemingly catches every fish, especially Red-tailed catfish, in the lake but the sareng. Deciding to face his demons instead of running from them, he returns to India to take part in a Hindu blessing, in order to appease the gods and convince them he means the fish no harm. Returning to the river, Jeremy finds he may have finally met his match.

Note* The Sareng was caught in the Lost Reels episode: Himalayan Giants, but was not mentioned here.

Chasing reports of three fishermen disappearing without a trace, Jeremy Wade ventures to the far east of Russia to investigate the [[Amur River]]. There, he interviews some of the locals. They mention that there is some kind of large fish in the river, but they don't tell him anything else. Believing that they are keeping some sort of secret, he talks to a local biologist, who tells him of an encounter with the Kaluga: a predatory freshwater sturgeon species known to grow up to 18 feet long. Armed with an enormous mouth, this fish could easily drag people in the water when hooked. After the fall of the Soviet Union, a sudden surge of fishing nearly wiped them out, as they produce delicious [[caviar]]. Now, people keep up illegal fishing for them and tell nobody, explaining the locals' secretive behaviour involving the fish. Journeying with a team of biologists who can legally catch the fish for research, Jeremy sets out to catch what may be the last of these monstrous fish.

Jeremy Wade had wanted to catch large fish since he was a child. One fish that interested him was the Taimen: a very large relative of the trouts and a very popular game fish with tourists. Due to heavy fishing for these trophies, their numbers have greatly declined. When new reports surface of violent attacks on people, Jeremy seizes the opportunity to reel in one of the last giant Taimen and travels to the wild frontiers of northern Mongolia, the Taimen's last stronghold. Upon his arrival he immediately runs into a big problem: Mongolians are not keen fishers and believe that killing fish brings ill fortune. Trekking deep into the wilderness to the [[Delgerm<U+00F6>r<U+00F6>n|Delger-Moron River]], he braves venomous vipers, violent gangs of gold prospectors and dangerous rapids. The legendary Taimen proves elusive and his Mongolian guide brings in a [[shaman]] in hopes of appeasing the river spirit.

Most people think sharks and rays are purely sea creatures, but Jeremy Wade knows different. He's caught large freshwater stingrays in Argentina and Thailand, and a Sawfish that could live in freshwater in Australia. He has also caught Bull Sharks in South Africa, Australia and Florida. Bull Sharks are salt water fish that have an unusual ability to tolerate freshwater, but are there other sharks with this same ability? Not 10 years ago, scientists discovered a new genus of rare sharks known as [[River shark|Glyphis sharks]] who can not only tolerate freshwater, but are purely freshwater fish. When a report of an unidentified attack on a person in Australia's Fitzroy River emerges, Jeremy wade journeys down under, wondering if the attacker was a Northern River Shark, a species of Glyphis Shark, and be one of the few people to catch one. Ruling out crocodiles and Bull Sharks, Jeremy determines that the little-known shark just might be the culprit. Joining a group of scientists, he sets out to a very dangerous body of water, only to make a discovery that could reveal the truth behind the attack. Then, battling both the odds and the tides, Jeremy hooks into a mysterious predator and becomes the first man to film it alive.

The season four finale episode is a two-hour look into one of the most challenging expeditions of Jeremy Wade's life. He'll travel to the isolated and untouched jungles of [[Guyana]], South America, where early explorers wrote about a river system filled with mysterious giants. Armed with only old journals and his rod, Wade embarks on an epic journey where he'll tackle the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] <U+2014> South America's third largest and largely unconquered river. He immerses himself in the culture of the [[Macushi people|Mucushi]] and must earn the trust of these native people in order to gather their knowledge and hear their stories. Once again he'll set out to separate fact from fiction. His last and greatest catch turns out to be a species of Arapaima new to science.

When a story surfaces of a man in Bolivia who had his face ripped off by something in the water, Jeremy Wade ventures deep into the South American jungle to find out what kind of horrible monster could be capable of this. Casting his line out, he catches nothing but piranha, but his previous experiments in Season 1 proved that piranha won't attack unless under special circumstances, so he immediately dismisses them as the culprit. But then, an interview with the doctor who performed the post-mortem on the victim reveals piranhas as the victims. Intrigued by this change in behaviour, Jeremy assumes it must be some new species. Travelling to a flooded forest, he is once again surprised to find Black Piranha, which are usually solitary hunters, engaging in very aggressive pack behaviour. Jeremy assumes these newly aggressive Black Piranha must be the culprit, until an interview with a witness reveals that it was Red Bellied Piranhas that ate the man's face. As this goes against his previous findings on piranha behaviour, Jeremy suspects that there must be some introduced predator in the river system that is making the piranha turn to man-eating tendencies. Investigating, Jeremy finds himself once again going face to face with what is perhaps his greatest adversary.

Following tales of a massive fish in Ukraine said to have tried to drag a man to his death, Jeremy Wade heads to the rural lakes of the former Soviet Union chasing the culprit. Asking around, he learns that there is indeed a large fish in the lake, but the local name is not familiar to him. Interviewing more locals, Jeremy learns of another attack, in which a repairman was diving in a cooling pool at a nuclear power plant when his arm was ripped off by a massive fish. When he asks for the name of the power plant, Jeremy's fears are realised: Chernobyl, home of the worst nuclear accident in history. Believing the contaminated waters to be the home to some kind of mutant monster, Jeremy travels to the abandoned and radioactive city of Pripyat to hunt down the beast. There, he finds a picture of the beast, and discovers it to be the massive Wels Catfish, a monster Jeremy has battled before. Putting himself in danger of radiation exposure, Jeremy fishes right in the shadow of the nuclear reactor and he comes face to face with a mutant river monster.

Not only are the arapaima in the area far bigger and more aggressive than those he has ever battled before, they are illegal to fish for. Through contact with a local chief, Wade manages to secure permission to fish for arapaima, but must do so in a way he has never done before - by [[fly fishing]]. Feeling outgunned due to this handicap, Wade soon finds himself locked in combat with the largest arapaima he has ever caught.

Jeremy arrives at the Kali River in India, where a number of mysterious drownings have occurred. He investigates the possibilities of the culprit being whirlpools or crocodiles, but determines neither fit. Wade eventually finds out of a little-known catfish species that can grow to a large size: the Goonch, or Giant Devil Catfish. He reasons that, since funeral pyres are done at the shore of the river, the fish feed off the burnt human remains. This would allow them to reach man-eating size, as well as giving them a taste of people. Jeremy then must face off against a large goonch which may prove there are monster goonch ready to eat people. Believing to have proven his point, he prepares to leave. Casting his line one last time, Jeremy hooks an even bigger monster and has a brief encounter with what may just be the Kali Killer.
