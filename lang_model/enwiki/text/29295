==Personal history==
Talovi<U+0107> was a [[Permanent residency|permanent resident]] who emigrated with his family from Bosnia to the United States in [[1998]]. Talovi<U+0107> received a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] in [[2005]]<ref name="More details emerging on Trolley Square gunman and victims"/> and lived with his mother in Salt Lake City.<ref name=" Chief: Teen gunman set out to kill many"/> He had a record of minor juvenile incidents and had [[Dropout|dropped out]] of [[high school]] at age 16.<ref name="Police: Off-Duty Cop Saved Lives In Mall">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/13/national/main2466711.shtml|title=Police: Off-Duty Cop Saved Lives In Mall|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>. Talovi<U+0107> often attended Friday prayers at the Al-Noor [[mosque]] in Salt Lake City.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_5230906 Salt Lake Tribune: Trolley Square: A search for answers]</ref>

==Motive==
Talovi<U+0107>'s aunt, Ajka Omerovi<U+0107>, emerged briefly from the family's house to say relatives had no idea why the young man attacked so many strangers. She said that Talovi<U+0107> had lived in the Sarajevo area as a child, and that his family moved to Utah from Bosnia. "He was such a good boy. I don't know what happened," she told Salt Lake City television station [[KSL-TV]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070214/ap_on_re_us/utah_shooting;_ylt=ArEZTRKdxu2AU.NfmvrEx2us0NUE "Off-Duty cop helped end Utah mall rage"], [[Associated Press]], Feb. 13, 2007</ref>

In another KSL interview, with Omerovi<U+0107>, and Talovi<U+0107>'s father, Suljo Talovi<U+0107>, the two indicated concern that some outside influence might have induced Sulejman to commit the killings. "I think this [Sulejman] did. I think somebody (is) behind him, I think, but I am not sure...."<ref>[http://www.ksl.com/?nid=459&sid=900702 "Trolley Square Shooter's Family Speaks to the Media"], KSL-TV, Feb. 18, 2007</ref>

The father suggested that the US government bears some responsibility for his son's actions, saying "The authorities are guilty for not alerting us that he bought a gun. In the US, you cannot buy cigarettes if you are underaged, but you can buy a gun."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/03/03/mall.shooter.ap/index.html "Utah mall shooter buried in native Bosnia"], CNN.com, Mar. 3, 2007</ref> Contrary to Mr. Talovi<U+0107>'s statement, federal law prohibits the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition to those under 21; shotguns and shotgun ammunition are prohibited to those under 18.<ref>[http://www.nraila.org/Issues/FactSheets/Read.aspx?ID=43 Gun laws in the US</ref>

In the light of the American [[War on Terrorism]] some [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], including commentator [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]]<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,253201,00.html Why No Mention That Salt Lake Shooter Was Muslim?], Fox News</ref> and congressman [[Chris Cannon]]<ref name="Cannon Takes Back">{{cite news|title= Cannon Takes Back 'Allah' Quote |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660197676,00.html| last=Speckman | first=Stephen |date=[[2007-02-22]]|publisher=Deseret Morning News}}</ref> have suggested that Talovi<U+0107> repeatedly shouted "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" prior to his death, suggesting a religious motive. Some sources reach this conclusion by listening to online video of the rampage, which supposedly captures Talovi<U+0107>'s religious shouting.<ref>[http://www.kcpw.org/article/3006 [Burbank Says Evidence Does Not Support 'Personal Jihad' in Mall Shooting"], [[KCPW]], Feb. 22, 2007.
