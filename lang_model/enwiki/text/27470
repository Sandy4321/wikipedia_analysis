'''New York State Route 285''' was a state highway that once connected [[New York State Route 69]] to Thompson Corners in the northeast. There, it terminated at an intersection with Oneida County Routes 67A and 70. The route was assigned by 1936 to the routing and remained intact for at least 52 more years until a maintenance swap between the state of New York and [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], where NY 285 was located.<ref name=law/> The route was decommissioned from a state touring route and downgraded to '''Oneida County Route 95'''. The designation has not been used since.

== History ==
Route 285 was assigned as early as 1936, from NY 69 to Thompson Corners, and remained as such for approximately the next 52 years.<ref name="1936map">{{cite map|publisher=[[Esso]]|title=Happy Motoring in New York|year=1936|cartography=General Drafting Inc.}}</ref> This was until the next in a series of maintenance swaps came to Oneida County in 1988. At that point, Route 285 was traded to the county on September 1. This was the only route assumed into the county system, being traded for County Route 32, which became [[New York State Route 922E]], a reference route that connects [[New York State Route 49]] with [[New York State Route 69]].<ref name=law>{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Route 285 was decommissioned by the state on November 4, 1988, two months after the swap was official, and Oneida County assumed responsibility for the highway.<ref name="dot"/> The route, which no longer kept its NY 285 designation, is now County Route 95. The NY 285 designation has not been used since the 1988 decommissioning.<ref name="nymap07">{{cite map|title=1977-2007 I love New York state map|date=2007|publisher=[[I Love New York]]}}</ref> The orders were written as followed:
<blockquote>
"...to transfer to the county  of
  Oneida  for  future  maintenance as part of the county highway system in
  Oneida and to issue official orders of abandonment of those portions  of
  highway  described  as  follows:  "beginning at a point on or near state
  highway five thousand one hundred thirty-nine, west  of  the  hamlet  of
  Taberg, thence running generally northwesterly to a county highway in or
  near the hamlet of Thompson Corners." - New York State Law, New York State Assembly <ref name=law/>

== Route description ==
Route 285 began at an intersection with [[New York State Route 69]] in Pine Hill. The route then traveled northward, intersecting with Main Street, which went into [[Taberg, New York|Taberg]]. There, Route 285 gained the moniker as the ''Taberg&ndash;Florence Highway'' and turned to the northeast. The route passed Saint Patrick's Cemetery and the remains of an old [[Protestant]] cemetery (directly across Route 285). As it continued northeastward, Route 285 passed a junkyard near the intersection with Pond Hill Road. The route made a curve to the north and passed a nearby spring. The route continued farther, making another curve soon after. After an intersection with Carlisle Road, Route 285 then entered a [[reforestation area]]. Near the center of the reforestation area, the highway intersected with County Route 88. After passing over Corkin Hill, Route 285 headed downhill into the town of Florence.<ref name="camdeneast">{{cite web|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=n33|title=Camden East, New York quadrangle|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|date=1978|cartography=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>

After crossing into Florence, Route 285 remained in the reforestation area, and continued towards Thompson Corners in a straight, northeastern direction.<ref name="camdeneast"/> After passing Greely Cemetery, Route 258 continued along State Highway 1158 until terminating at an intersection with County Route 67A, which headed to Empeyville, and County Route 70, which went to Camden and the hamlet of Florence.<ref name="florence">{{cite web|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=m33|title=Florence, New York quadrangle|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|date=1968|cartography=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>
