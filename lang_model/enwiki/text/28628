"'''Something'''" is a song released by [[The Beatles]] in 1969. It was featured on the album ''[[Abbey Road]]'', and was also the first song written by [[George Harrison]] to appear on the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]] of a Beatles single. It was one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on a [[long playing]] (LP) [[album]], with both "Something" and "Come Together" having appeared on ''Abbey Road''. "Something" was the only Harrison composition to top the American charts while he was in The Beatles.

[[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]<U+2014>[[Lennon/McCartney|the two principal songwriting members of the band]]<U+2014>both praised "Something" as among the best songs Harrison had written. As well as critical acclaim, the single achieved commercial success, topping the [[Billboard charts]] in the United States, and entering the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The song has been covered by over 150 artists including [[Elvis Presley]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[James Brown]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Joe Cocker]], and is the second-most covered Beatles song after "[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]".<ref name="Time">{{cite new |last=Sullivan |first=Michael |year=2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001409-4,00.html |title=His Magical, Mystical Tour |work=[[Time Magazine|Time]] |date=10 December 2001 |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

==Writing==
During the 1968 recording sessions for ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also referred to as the ''White Album''), Harrison began working on a song that eventually became known as "Something". The song's first lyrics were adapted from the title of an unrelated song by fellow [[Apple Records|Apple]] artist [[James Taylor]] called "[[James_Taylor_(album)#Track_listing|Something In The Way She Moves]]" and used as filler while the melody was being developed.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Ian|title=Revolution in the Head:The Beatles' Records and the Sixties|publisher=Pimlico|year=2003|edition=Second Revised|pages=348|isbn=9781844138289}}</ref> The song's second line, "Attracts me like no other lover," was the last to be written; during early recording sessions for "Something", Harrison alternated between two placeholder lyrics: "Attracts me like a [[cauliflower]]" and "Attracts me like a [[pomegranate]]."<ref name="pauldunoyer">Paul Du Noyer article: "[http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=238 George Harrison's Uncertain Something]."</ref>

Harrison later said that "I had a break while Paul was doing some overdubbing so I went into an empty studio and began to write. That's really all there is to it, except the middle took some time to sort out. It didn't go on the ''White Album'' because we'd already finished all the tracks."<ref name="quotes">[http://www.geocities.com/~beatleboy1/dba11road.html "Album: Abbey Road"]. Retrieved 30 March 2006.</ref> A [[Demo (music)|demo recording]] of the song by Harrison from this period appears on the ''[[Anthology 3|Beatles Anthology 3]]'' collection, released in 1996.

Many believe that Harrison's inspiration for "Something" was his wife at the time, [[Pattie Boyd]]. Boyd also claimed that inspiration in her 2007 autobiography, ''Wonderful Tonight'', where she wrote: "He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me."<ref>{{cite book | title= Wonderful Tonight  | author= Boyd, Pattie| coauthors= Penny Junor | year= 2007 | publisher= Harmony Books  | isbn= 0-307-39384-4 |pages= 117}}</ref>

However, Harrison has cited other sources of inspiration to the contrary. In a 1996 interview he responded to the question of whether the song was about Pattie: "Well no, I didn't [write it about her]. I just wrote it, and then somebody put together a video. And what they did was they went out and got some footage of me and [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie]], Paul and [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], Ringo and [[Maureen Cox|Maureen]], it was at that time, and John and [[Yoko Ono|Yoko]] and they just made up a little video to go with it. So then, everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie, but actually, when I wrote it, I was thinking of [[Ray Charles]]."<ref>Paul Cashmere (1996). [http://abbeyrd.net/harrison.htm "George Harrison Gets "Undercover"]. Retrieved 1 January 2008.</ref>

The original intention had been for Harrison to offer the song to [[Jackie Lomax]], as had been done with the previous Harrison composition, "[[Sour Milk Sea]]." When this fell through, the song was given to [[Joe Cocker]] (who had previously covered The Beatles' "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]"); his version came out two months before that of The Beatles. During the ''[[Let It Be#Recording sessions|Get Back]]'' recording sessions for what eventually became ''[[Let It Be]]'', Harrison considered using "Something," but eventually decided against it due to his fear that insufficient care would be taken in its recording; his earlier suggestion of "[[Old Brown Shoe]]" had not gone down well with the band.<ref>Cross, Craig (2006). [http://www.beatles-discography.com/day-by-day/?d=january-1969 "Beatles History - 1969"]. Retrieved 1 April 2006.</ref> It was only during the recording sessions for ''[[Abbey Road]]'' that The Beatles began seriously working on "Something."

==Production notes==
{{Main|Abbey Road (album)}}

"Something" was recorded during the ''Abbey Road'' sessions. It took 52 takes in two main periods, the first session involved a demo take on Harrison's 26th birthday, 25 February 1969, followed by 13 backing track takes on 16 April. The second main session took 39 takes and started on 2 May 1969 when the main parts of the song were laid down in 36 takes, finishing on 15 August 1969 after several days of recording [[overdub]]s.<ref>[http://www.norwegianwood.org/beatles/disko/uklp/abbey.htm norwegianwood.org] 1969: Abbey Road. retrieved 2 October 2008</ref>

The original draft that the Beatles used lasted eight minutes, with Lennon on the [[piano]] towards the end (which was recorded later as Lennon was not present during the first few sessions). The middle also contained a small [[counter-melody]] section in the draft. Both the counter-melody and Lennon's piano piece were cut from the final version. Still, Lennon's piano was not erased totally. Some bits can be heard in the middle eight, in particular the line played downwards the C major scale, i.e. the connection passage to Harrison's guitar solo. The erased parts of Lennon's piano section later became the basis for Lennon's song "[[Remember (John Lennon song)|Remember]]."

The promotional video for "Something" was shot shortly before the [[The Beatles breakup|breakup of the band]]. By this time, the individual Beatles had drawn apart and so the film consisted of separate clips of each Beatle walking around his home, accompanied by his wife, edited together.<ref name="b_s"/>

==Composition==

The lead vocalist for "Something" was [[George Harrison]]. The song runs at a speed of about sixty-six [[beats per minute]] and is in [[common time]] throughout. The [[melody]] begins in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[C major]]. It continues in this key throughout the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] and the first two [[Verse (popular music)|verses]], until the eight-measure-long [[bridge (music)|bridge]], which is in the key of [[A major]]. After the bridge, the melody returns to C Major for the [[guitar solo]], the third verse, and the [[outro]].<ref>Pollack, Alan W. (1999). [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/s.shtml "Notes on 'Something{{' "}}]. Retrieved 27 August 2009.</ref> Although The Beatles had initially attempted an edgier [[acoustic music|acoustic]] version of the song, this was dropped along with the counter-melody. A demo of the acoustic version with the counter-melody included was later released as part of ''[[Anthology 3]]''. On the final release, the counter-melody was replaced by an [[instrumental break]], and the song was given a softer tone with the introduction of a string arrangement by [[George Martin]], The Beatles' producer.<ref name="amg">{{cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |year=2006 |year=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:t9ec9jijkrht |title="Something" |accessdate=30 March 2006}}</ref>

Simon Leng said the song's theme is doubt and uncertainty.<ref>{{cite book | title= While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison  | author= Leng, Simon | year= 2006 | publisher= Hal Leonard  | isbn= 1-4234-0609-5 | url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NRoFPFvI1joC&pg=PA41&dq=something+george+harrison&as_brr=3&ei=P-vkSNnFI4LwsQPKm5W-Dw&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U2d2GNLPweZh1srzMHRNDQ0h2uebw#PPA41,M1 <!--google books accessed 2 Oct 2008 --> | pages = 41}}</ref>  [[Richie Unterberger]] of [[All music]] described it as "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" at a time "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".<ref name="amg"/>

==Reception==
The ''Abbey Road'' album was the first Beatles release to feature "Something"; it was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, with the United States' release following on 1 October, and performed well, topping the charts in both countries.<ref>Cross, Craig (2006). [http://www.beatles-discography.com/record-by-record/?uk-album=abbey-road "British Albums"]. Retrieved 2 April 2006.</ref><ref>Cross, Craig (2006). [http://www.beatles-discography.com/record-by-record/?us-album=abbey-road "American Albums"]. Retrieved 2 April 2006.</ref>

A few days later on 6 October, "Something" was released as a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] single with "[[Come Together]]" in the United States, becoming the first Harrison composition to receive top billing on a Beatles single.<ref name="a_s">Cross, Craig (2006). [http://www.beatles-discography.com/record-by-record/?us-singles=something "American Singles"]. Retrieved 30 March 2006.</ref>

Although it began charting a week after its release on 18 October, doubts began to arise over the possibility of "Something" topping the American charts. It was the prevailing practice at the time to count sales and airplay of the A- and B-sides separately, which allowed for separate chart positions.  With "Come Together" rivaling "Something" in popularity, it was hardly certain that either side of the single would reach number one. However, on 29 November, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' started factoring the combined performance of both A- and B-sides into their calculations, as one single.  The result was that "Come Together"/"Something" topped the American charts for a week, before eventually falling out of the charts about two months later (on the concurrent [[Cash Box]] singles chart, which continued to measure the performance on both sides of a single separately, "Something" peaked at number two while "Come Together" spent three weeks at number one). The single was certified [[Gold single|Gold]] just three   weeks after its initial release, but was not heard of again in terms of sales until 1999, when it was declared [[Platinum single|Platinum]].<ref name="a_s"/>

In the UK, "Something" came out on 31 October. It was the first Beatles single to have a Harrison song on the A-side, and it was also the Beatles' first single to feature songs already available on an album.<ref name="priorsingles">The Beatles released some singles and then included them on albums, but "Something" was issued on ''[[Abbey Road]]'' before its release as a single.</ref> "Something" first entered the chart on 8 November, eventually peaking at number four, before falling out of the charts three months after its initial release. In the UK [[Shirley Bassey]]'s version also reached #4.<ref name="b_s">Cross, Craig (2006). [http://www.beatles-discography.com/record-by-record/?uk-singles=something "British Singles"]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}. Retrieved 30 March 2006.</ref>

Although Harrison himself had been dismissive of the song<U+2014>he later said that he "put it on ice for about six months because I thought 'that's too easy{{' "}}<ref name="bbc">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/something.shtml "Something"]. Retrieved 2 April 2006.</ref><U+2014>Lennon and McCartney both stated that they held "Something" in high regard. Lennon said "I think that's about the best track on the album, actually", while McCartney said "For me I think it's the best he's written."<ref name="quotes"/> Both had largely ignored Harrison's compositions prior to "Something", with their own songs taking much of the limelight. Lennon later explained:

{{cquote|There was an embarrassing period when George's songs weren't that good and nobody wanted to say anything. He just wasn't in the same league for a long time<U+2014>that's not putting him down, he just hadn't had the practice as a writer that we'd had.<ref name="b_s"/>}}

===Awards===
In 1970, the same year the Beatles announced they had split, "Something" received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.<ref>[http://www.britishacademy.com/ivorsmenu/1970.htm "The Ivor Novello Awards for the Year 1970"]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}. Retrieved 2 April 2006.</ref>
"Something" continues to garner accolades from the musical establishment decades after its release, with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) website naming it as the 64th-greatest song ever. According to the BBC, "Something" shows more clearly than any other song in The Beatles canon that there were three great songwriters in the band rather than just two."<ref name="bbc"/> The Beatles' official website itself said that "Something" "underlined the ascendancy of George Harrison as a major song writing force".<ref name="something">{{cite web |url=http://www.beatles.com/html/something/ |title="Something" |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030206173346/http://www.beatles.com/html/something/ |archivedate=2003-02-06 |accessdate=2003-02-06}}</ref> In 1999, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI) named "Something" as the 17th-most performed song of the 20th century, with five million performances in all. Other Beatles songs on the list were "[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]" and "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]", both written by Paul McCartney (though attributed to Lennon and McCartney).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/awards/1999/top100.asp |title=Awards: The BMI Top 100 Songs |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040211190114/http://www.bmi.com/awards/1999/top100.asp |archivedate=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2004-02-11}}</ref> {{RS500S|273|"Something"}}

==Cover versions==
With more than 150 versions, "Something" is the second most covered Beatles song after "Yesterday".<ref name="Time"/> It began accumulating [[cover version]]s from other artists almost immediately after its release by the Beatles.  [[Lena Horne]] recorded a cover version in November 1969 for the album she recorded with guitarist [[Gabor Szabo]], ''Lena and Gabor''.  Other cover versions soon appeared, including versions from Presley (who included it in his [[Aloha from Hawaii]] TV special), Sinatra, [[The O'Jays]], and Charles, who Harrison originally had in mind as the singer when he wrote "Something." Harrison nevertheless later said that his favourite cover versions were those by Brown and Robinson. 

[[Frank Sinatra]] was particularly impressed with "Something;" calling it "the greatest love song ever written," he sang it hundreds of times at various [[concert]]s. However, he once made the comment that "Something" was his all-time favourite [[Lennon/McCartney]] song (knowing neither composed the track), and frequently introduced it as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2006/12/sinatra_elvis_a.html |title=The Movable Buffet: Los Angeles Times |publisher=Vegasblog.latimes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> Harrison did not appear to mind this, and instead borrowed an alteration to the lyric that Sinatra had made. Where the original song was "You stick around now it may show," Sinatra sang "You stick around, Jack, she might show." This change was adopted by Harrison, who used the same lyrics whenever he performed "Something" as part of his touring repertoire.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marck |first=John T. |year=2006 |url=http://www.iamthebeatles.com/article1029.html |title=Oh Look Out!

A version by country singer [[Johnny Rodriguez]] reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in the spring of 1974.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, "Top Country Songs: 1944-2005," 2006</ref> The song also appeared on the 1995 Beatles tribute album ''[[Come Together: America Salutes The Beatles]]'', performed by [[Tanya Tucker]]. [[Musiq Soulchild]] also covered the song.

In 2002, after Harrison's death, McCartney and [[Eric Clapton]] performed "Something" at the [[Concert for George]]. Their performance was nominated for the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].<ref>[http://www.stuck-inside-a-cloud.net/CFGwinsGrammy.html "Grammy Win For 'The Concert For George{{' "}}]. Retrieved 2 April 2006.</ref> [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]] also performed the song using just a [[ukulele]] on his "Back in The US" and "Back in the World" tours. The song was also performed as a tribute to Harrison by McCartney in 2008 at the Liverpool Sound Concert, where he performs the song in a similar fashion to that of the Concert for George, starting off with only a ukulele for accompaniment, then after the bridge, being joined by the full band to conclude the song similarly to that of the original recording.<ref>[http://www.dvdmg.com/mccartneybackinus.shtml Paul McCartney Back in the US DVD review].
