==Plot==
After finding out that all of the nuclear plant's staff members had been informed of the plant's maintenance via e-mail, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] decides to buy a [[computer]]. After he gives up on learning how to use it, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] sets up the computer. Homer eventually catches on and starts his own [[webpage]], which contains copyrighted material from other pages. To avoid getting sued, Homer calls himself "Mister X". Late at night, unable to sleep until someone visits his page, Homer hears a rumor from [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] started by either [[Nelson Muntz]] or [[Jimbo Jones]] that [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] [[Embezzlement|spent the street repair fund]] on a secret swimming pool. He posts this rumor on his page, which is seen by several of Springfield's citizens. Mayor Quimby is the subject of a city-wide scandal when a barrage of reporters find a luxurious pool along with many scantily dressed women in Quimby's office. Homer keeps his anonymity while posting more rumors. Eventually, Mr. X wins the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his journalistic achievements, despite nobody knowing who he is. When he hears that the prize money will be given to starving children, Homer reveals that he is Mr. X. With the whole town aware of Homer<U+2019>s [[alter ego|double identity]], no one wants to talk near him and his Internet fame plummets. To boost his popularity, Homer begins posting outrageous stories on his webpage. His fame back, Homer celebrates by going to the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] and ends up getting kidnapped.

Homer wakes up on the "Island", a place where the inhabitants are people who have been exiled from society for harboring dangerous secrets. Homer learns from the organization's leader, [[Number Two (The Prisoner)|Number Two]], that a story he wrote about flu vaccinations containing mind-control serum was true. The mind control drug is calibrated to drive people into a frenzy of shopping, which is why flu shots are administered shortly before [[Christmas]]. While he is trapped, Homer is replaced at home by a doppelganger with a thick German accent. [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]] tells Homer about a makeshift boat he spent thirty-three years making, which Homer steals and escapes the "Island" with, popping the [[Rover (The Prisoner)|Rover]] to emerge from the water to trap him. When he gets home, Homer tries to send out a message to the police through his computer, but is stopped by Number Two taking over the computer and is caught by his doppelganger. Homer fights his double and defeats him by kicking him in the crotch. [[Simpson family|The family]] is happy the real Homer is back and [[Santa's Little Helper]] spouts a gas that drugs the entire family. The episode ends with everyone in the family enjoying their strange, new life on the "Island".

When he looked at the couch gag however, he was pleased with it and ordered the animators to "go with it".<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2009).

According to Kirkland, none of the animators knew what the prize looked like and had to do some research in order to make it accurate.<ref name="Kirkland" />

The third act of "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" is a pastiche of the 1967 science fiction television series ''[[The Prisoner]]''.<ref name="Scully" /> In order "get the feel" of ''The Prisoner'', the writers watched its opening sequence, which summarizes the story of the series. Kirkland, who had seen a couple of episodes as a child, watched several episodes of the series with ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> animators in order to make "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" resemble it. They were also influenced by 1960's [[modernism]] and furniture designs from the 1971 science fiction film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref name="Kirkland" /> The episode features American-born actor [[Patrick McGoohan]] as [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]], the central character in ''The Prisoner'', which McGoohan created. Aside from ''The Prisoner'', McGoohan did not do a lot of television work,<ref name="aoltv">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/01/14/patrick-mcgoohan-dead-at-80-video/ |title=Patrick McGoohan dead at 80 |date=January 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |last=Sassone |first=Bob |publisher=[[AOL]]}}</ref> and "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" was the only time he reprised his role as Number Six.<ref name="thetimes">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5519163.ece |title=Patrick McGoohan, creator and star of The Prisoner, dies |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |last=Burgess |first=Kaya |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] }}</ref> In the DVD commentary for the episode, Payne said that McGoohan was "very funny", and that all the writers wanted to meet him when he came to record his dialogue for the episode.<ref name="Payne" /> McGoohan was reportedly very pleased with his role in the episode; when his wife Joan McGoohan, who is a [[real estate broker]], helped staff writer [[Max Pross]] buy a house, she told him that Patrick McGoohan was as proud of the episode as anything in his career.<ref name="Pross">Pross, Max.

==Cultural references==
"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" makes fun of use of the Internet, which was rapidly growing in popularity at the time. "[...] The Internet was just starting to turn into a serious waste of time around this point in history", staff writer [[Matt Selman]] said in the episode's DVD commentary.<ref name="Selman" /> The episode was also written at a time when several ''The Simpsons'' producers invested in an animated web series' company called [[icebox.com]], which was co-created by two former ''The Simpsons'' writers.<ref name="Gammill">Gammill, Tom. (2009). Commentary for "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Although the title of the episode is a reference to the 1969 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes]]'', the episode itself has "essentially nothing" to do with the film, according to M. Keith Booker in his book ''Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy.''<ref name="drawnto">{{harvnb|Booker|2006|p=59}}</ref> In the episode, the slogan of Homer's webpage is "All the muck that's fit to rake". This is a reference to the American newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'', whose slogan is "All the News That's Fit to Print". The word "muck" refers to [[muckrakers]], a term closely associated with reform-oriented journalists who wrote largely for popular magazines after 1900.<ref name="contracostatimes">{{cite news |title=Why 'The Simpsons' still rules |date=March 29, 2001 |page=D01 |work=[[Contra Costa Times]] |publisher=David Rounds |author=Ben Golze |coauthors=|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

The episode's third act, which serves as a parody of ''The Prisoner'', features several references to the series. When the secret organization find out about Homer's discovery, he is taken to a secret location called the "Island". The "Island" is modeled after the "[[The Village (The Prisoner)|Village]]", where Number Six is taken in ''The Prisoner''.<ref name="drawnto" /> While he is in the "Island", Homer is repeatedly gassed by unexpected objects, a reference to the way Number Six would often be gassed in ''The Prisoner''. "George [Meyer] and I used to laugh a lot about how often [Number Six] would be gassed by unexpected devices in the show", Scully said in the episode's DVD commentary. "And we wanted to cram as many in as we could."<ref name="Scully" /> While escaping the "Island", Homer is chased by a "big balloon". The balloon is a reference to [[Rover (The Prisoner)|Rover]], a floating white ball in ''The Prisoner'' that was created to keep inhabitants in the "Village",<ref name="Kirkland" /> which was also featured in the season 9 episode ''[[The Joy of Sect]]''. The music heard in the scene is based on ''The Prisoner''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s theme music.<ref name="Scully" />

==Release and reception==
In its original American broadcast on December&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2000, "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" received a 9.0 rating, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], translating to approximately 9.1&nbsp;million viewers. The episode finished in 28th place in the ratings for the week of November&nbsp;27-December&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2000, tying with an episode of the [[news magazine]] ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' and the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''.<ref name="press-telegram">{{cite news |title=TV's top, and bottom, shows |date=December 6, 2000 |page=A14 |work=[[Press-Telegram]] |publisher=[[MediaNews Group]] |author=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref> After the episode was released, ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> writers created a website called mrxswebpage.com, which was made to resemble Homer's website in the episode. This was at a time when many television shows created websites to promote episodes;<ref name="Selman" /> earlier that year, Fox created a website called whatbadgerseat.com in conjunction with the [[A Tale of Two Springfields|season premiere]], in which badgers played an important role.<ref name="Payne" /> On August&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2009, the episode was released as part of a [[DVD]] set called ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season''.

Cohen participated in the audio commentary for the episode.<ref name="Scully" />

Following its broadcast, "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Giving it a positive review, [[DVD Talk]]'s Jason Bailey described the episode as a "smart piece of social satire". He especially enjoyed Homer's part in the episode, and found that his incompetence at handling computers is "comedic gold".<ref name="dvdtalk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38345/simpsons-the-complete-twelfth-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons: The Twelfth Season |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |last=Bailey |first=Jason |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] }}</ref> Casey Burchby, another reviewer for DVD Talk, also enjoyed the social satire in the episode, and although he found the parody of ''The Prisoner'' "bizarre", he maintained that it was "bold".<ref name="dvdtalk2">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38338/simpsons-the-complete-twelfth-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons: The Twelfth Season |date=August 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |last=Burchby |first=Casey |publisher=DVD Talk }}</ref> Writing for [[DVD Verdict]], Mac MacEntire argued that the episode is "hilarious", provided one has seen ''The Prisoner''.<ref name="dvdverdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsons12.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011|last=McEntire |first=Mac |publisher=[[DVD Verdict]]}}</ref> DNA Smith described the episode as "memorable".<ref name="pilot-news">{{cite news |title=Couch theater DVD previews |date=August 7, 2009 |page=B4 |work=Pilot-News |publisher=Horizon Publications |author=DNA Smith |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref> The episode is also often considered to be a fan favorite, according to Matt Haigh of Den of Geek.<ref name="denofgeek">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/Reviews/329775/the_simpsons_season_12_dvd_review.html |title=The Simpsons Season 12 DVD review |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011|last=Haigh |first=Matt |publisher=Den of Geek }}</ref> On the other hand, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson was less impressed with the episode. In his review of ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season'', Jacobson wrote that he enjoyed the episode's take on "Internet idiocy". He wrote, "Some parts of it feel dated, but the web features even more ill-informed opinions today than it did nine years ago, so much of it remains timeless and on target." However, he was critical of the episode's third act. "The side of the show feels like it was intended to amuse a few fans and it doesn<U+2019>t show a lot of real cleverness or wit", he wrote. He summarized the episode as being decent, but inconsistent.<ref name="dvdmovieguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasontwelve.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season (2000) |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011|last=Jacobson |first=Colin |publisher=DVD Movie Guide }}</ref>
