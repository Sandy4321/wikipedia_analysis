Although there is no known definitive cure, several '''therapies for multiple sclerosis'''  have proven to be helpful. [[Multiple sclerosis]] (abbreviated MS) is a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Inflammation|inflammatory]], [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system (CNS)]]. 

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype and is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years many of the people who have this subtype begin to have neurologic decline without acute relapses being the secondary progressive subtype. Other courses are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks); but they are not so common. Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a [[diagnosis]] of MS who have a [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating]] event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. 

Therapy is aimed at returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatments]] are followed by many patients, despite a paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; [[idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|borderline forms of MS]] have particular treatments that are excluded.

== Management of acute attacks ==
[[Image:Methylprednisolone.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses.]]

During symptomatic attacks, patients may be hospitalized. As of 2007, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]],<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682795.html Methylprednisolone Oral.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-04-01]]).

Retrieved on [[2007-09-01]].</ref> is the routine therapy for acute relapses. These are given over a period of three to five days; having a well established [[efficacy]] promoting a  better recovery of [[disability]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, ''et al'' |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

The aim of this kind of treatment is to end the attack sooner and leave fewer lasting deficits. Although generally effective in the short term for relieving [[symptom]]s, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery: steroids produce a rapid improvement in disability, but this improvement only lasts up to thirty days following the clinical attack, is not evident thirty-six months after the attack, and does not reduce the number of patients who would subsequently develop a clinical [[relapse]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brusaferri F, Candelise L |title=Steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=J.

Recent studies suggest that oral steroid pills are just as effective at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. However, short term treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids does not seem to be attended by [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]]s; on the contrary, [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms and psychiatric disorders are more common with oral corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filippini G, Brusaferri F, Sibley WA, ''et al'' |title=Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD001331 |year=2000 |pmid=11034713 |doi=}}</ref>

== Management of relapsing-remitting MS ==
[[Image:Injection 23.JPG|left|thumb|Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and require frequent injections.]]

As of 2006, six [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)-approved treatments for patients with relapsing-remitting MS were available in the United States. Three were [[interferon]]s: two formulations of [[interferon beta-1a]] (trade names ''Avonex'' and ''Rebif''; the first given weekly, the latter three times a week),<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a693040.html Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2006-04-01]]).

A fourth medication is [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone''),<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a603016.html Glatiramer injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-07-01]]).

The fifth medication, [[mitoxantrone]], is an [[immunosuppressant]] also used in [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]]. Finally, the sixth medication is [[natalizumab]] (marketed as ''Tysabri'').<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a605006.html Natalizumab Injection.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2006-10-01]]). Retrieved on [[2007-09-02]].</ref> Natalizumab was finally approved in May 2006 after a long process.

All six medications have been proven to be modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks and slowing progression to disability, although they differ in their efficacy rate. Comparisons between immunomodulators (all but glatiramer) show that the most effective is natalizumab, but studies of its long-term effects are still lacking.<ref name="pmid17350652">{{cite journal |author=Johnson KP |title=Control of multiple sclerosis relapses with immunomodulating agents |journal=J.

Mitoxantrone is probably the most effective of them all;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gonsette RE |title=Compared benefit of approved and experimental immunosuppressive therapeutic approaches in multiple sclerosis |journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=1103<U+2013>16 |year=2007 |pmid=17516874 |doi=10.1517/14656566.8.8.1103}}</ref> however, its use is limited by severe [[cardiotoxicity]].<ref name="pmid16503747">{{cite journal |author=Murray TJ |title=The cardiac effects of mitoxantrone: do the benefits in multiple sclerosis outweigh the risks? |journal=Expert opinion on drug safety |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=265<U+2013>74 |year=2006 |pmid=16503747 |doi=10.1517/14740338.5.2.265}}</ref> This is the reason why its mainly used to treat MS patients who have worsening relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis despite prior therapy with interferons or glatiramer acetate.

Medications also differ in ease of use, price and side effects. All of these therapies are expensive and require frequent [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s, with Tysabri given as [[intravenous]] infusions every four weeks, Avonex requiring weekly injections and Copaxone daily injections. Mitoxantrone is intravenously administered every three months as a slow [[Infusion (disambiguation)|infusion]] over at least thirty minutes (in order to reduce cardiac toxicity).

Even with appropriate use of medication, most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and subsequent disability.

== Management of progressive MS ==
[[Image:Mitoxantrone skeletal.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of mitoxantrone. In 2007 it was the only approved treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.]]

Treatment of progressive MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS, and many patients do not respond to any therapy. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of disease.  

[[Mitoxantrone]] has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the disease progression and the frequency of relapses in patients in the short-term follow-up.<ref name="pmid16235298">{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2}}</ref> In 2007, it was the only medication approved was for secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; but causes dose-dependent [[cardiac]] [[toxicity]] which limits its long-term use. Interferon-beta-1b slowed progression of the disease in a clinical trial for secondary progressive MS, but not in another. In both studies however interferon recipients had fewer relapses and less  disease activity, assessed by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Therefore interferons show promise in secondary progressive MS, but more data is needed to support widespread use.<ref name="pmid15182221">{{cite journal |author=McCormack PL, Scott LJ |title=Interferon-beta-1b: a review of its use in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis |journal=CNS drugs |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=521<U+2013>46 |year=2004 |pmid=15182221 |doi=}}</ref>

Several trials have been designed specifically for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), including trials with [[interferon]]s and [[mitoxantrone]], a phase III trial of [[glatiramer acetate]], and an open-label study of [[riluzole]].<ref> [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a696013.html Riluzole.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) ([[2003-04-01]]).

== Management of demyelination without a diagnosis of MS ==
The earliest clinical presentation of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of [[demyelination]] but the person doesn't fullfill the [[McDonald criteria|criteria]] for multiple sclerosis.<ref name="pmid15847841">{{cite journal |author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5}}</ref> Several studies have shown that starting treatment with [[interferon]]s during the initial attack can decrease the chance that a patient will develop MS.

==Side effects of disease-modifying treatments==
Both the [[interferon]]s and [[glatiramer acetate]] are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause irritation at the injection site. 

[[Interferon]]s are produced in the body during illnesses such as [[influenza]] in order to help fight the [[infection]].<ref name="pmid17131933">{{cite journal |author=Sl<U+00E1>dkov<U+00E1> T, Kostolansk<U+00FD> F |title=The role of cytokines in the immune response to influenza A virus infection |journal=Acta Virol. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=151<U+2013>62 |year=2006 |pmid=17131933 |doi=}}</ref> They are responsible for the [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and [[headache]] common during influenza infections.

However the clinical consequences of the presence of antibodies are presently unclear: it has not been proved that these antibodies reduce efficacy of treatment.

[[Glatiramer acetate]] is generally considered to be better tolerated than the interferons although some patients taking glatiramer acetate experience a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart [[palpitation]]s, breathlessness, and anxiety; which usually lasts less than thirty minutes.<ref name="pmid14974077">{{cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678}}</ref>

[[Mitoxantrone]] therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and [[liver]] damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related [[cardiac]] [[toxicity]]. Therefore careful adherence to the administration and monitoring [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] is essential; this includes obtaining an [[echocardiogram]] and a [[complete blood count]] before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, [[infection]] or liver malfunction during therapy.<ref name="pmid16750460">{{cite journal |author=Fox EJ |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clinical therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461<U+2013>74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}</ref>

In [[clinical trial|phase III studies]], [[natalizumab]] was highly effective and well tolerated; however, three cases of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) were identified in patients who had taken it in combination with interferons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Tyler KL |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy complicating treatment with natalizumab and interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=353 |issue=4 |pages=369<U+2013>74 |year=2005 |pmid=15947079 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051782}} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/353/4/369 Free full text with registration]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Langer-Gould A, Atlas SW, Green AJ, Bollen AW, Pelletier D |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient treated with natalizumab |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=353 |issue=4 |pages=375<U+2013>81 |year=2005 |pmid=15947078 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051847}} [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/353/4/375 Free full text with registration]</ref> PML is a rare and progressive [[demyelinating]] disease of the [[brain]] that typically causes permanent disability or death.

== Management of the effects of MS ==
Disease modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but don't stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses the symptomatology tends to increase; being MS associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[handicap]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. 

Both different medications and [[neurorehabilitation]] even though not having influence on disease progression have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.<ref name="pmid16168933">{{cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643<U+2013>52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}</ref>

===Neurorehabilitation===

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty to move; difficulties with coordination and balance; problems in speech ([[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain]] syndromes, [[bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, [[cognitive]] impairment, or emotional symptomatology (mainly [[depression]]). The main clinical measure of disability progression and severity of the symptoms is the [[Expanded Disability Status Scale]] or EDSS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurtzke JF |title=Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) |journal=Neurology |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1444<U+2013>52 |year=1983 |pmid=6685237 |doi=}}</ref> At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Therefore treatments should be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician.

== Therapies under investigation ==
{{Main|Therapies under investigation for multiple sclerosis}}

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. There are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis; such as the combination of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[glatiramer acetate]] (Copaxone).<ref> [http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial.] Onyx Healthcare ([[2006-01-01]]). Retrieved on [[2007-09-02]].</ref> However most treatments already in clinical trials involve drugs that are used in other diseases. These are the cases of [[alemtuzumab]] (trade name Campath),<ref> [http://www.genzyme.com/corp/media/GENZ%20PR-050207.asp Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Announce Detailed Interim Two-Year Alemtuzumab in Multiple Sclerosis Data Presented at AAN.] Genzyme ([[2007-02-01]]).

[[Image:Cannabis sativa.jpg|right|thumb|Many patients use medical marijuana as an alternative treatment to help them alleviate some symptoms.]]

Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] regimens, particularly those including [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s, and [[vitamin]]s might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schreibelt G, Musters RJ, Reijerkerk A, ''et al'' |title=Lipoic acid affects cellular migration into the central nervous system and stabilizes blood-brain barrier integrity |journal=J.

Many diets have been proposed for treating the symptoms of the disease. Patients have reported a decrease of symptoms after long-term application of the diets; however no controlled trials have been able to proof their efficacy.<ref name="pmid17253500">{{cite journal |author=Farinotti M, Simi S, Di Pietrantonj C, ''et al'' |title=Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004192 |year=2007 |pmid=17253500 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004192.pub2}}</ref>
Even if these diets really are beneficial for people with MS, it is uncertain whether this fact is due to some special traits of the diets or simply that they are beneficial for whole body health. Some examples of these kind of diets are the [[Swank Multiple Sclerosis Diet]] or the [[The Optimal Diet]].<ref>http://thincs.org/discuss.highfat-lowcarb.htm (retrieved Jan 18, 2007)</ref>

[[Herbal medicine]] is another source for alternative treatments. ''[[Andrographis paniculata]]'', ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'' and ''[[Forsythia suspensa]]''; three medicinal plants traditionally used in China for treating conditions associated with inflammation and viral infection reduced the inflammation of [[epithelial]] cells infected by [[influenza A]] virus. Since inflammation is crucial in MS in the future these plants could be utilized to ease the progression of the disease.<ref name="pmid16621378">{{cite journal |author=Ko HC, Wei BL, Chiou WF |title=The effect of medicinal plants used in Chinese folk medicine on RANTES secretion by virus-infected human epithelial cells |journal=Journal of ethnopharmacology |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=205<U+2013>10 |year=2006 |pmid=16621378 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2006.03.004}}</ref> Many patients also use medical [[marijuana]] to help alleviate symptoms; however, the results of experimental studies are scarce; but at least a subgroup with greater disability appears to derive some symptomatic benefit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chong MS, Wolff K, Wise K, Tanton C, Winstock A, Silber E |title=Cannabis use in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Mult.
