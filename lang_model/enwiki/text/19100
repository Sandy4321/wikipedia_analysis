'''Mellitus''' (died 24 April 624) was the first [[Bishop of London]] and the third [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and was one of the members of the [[Gregorian mission]] sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons. He was sent to England in 601 AD, and was accompanied by other clergy to agument the missonaries already there. In 604 he was consecrated as Bishop of London, but in 616 after the death of his patron he was forced to leave London and take refuge in Gaul. He returned to England within the next year, but was never able to return to London as the inhabitants remained pagans. In 619 he was consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury. While archbishop he was alleged to have saved the cathedral and much of the town of Canterbury from a fire. After his death in 624, he was reverred as a saint.

==Early life==

The medieval chronicler [[Bede]] describes Mellitus as being of noble birth and [[Pope Gregory I]] describes him as an [[abbot]].<ref name=DNB>Brooks "Mellitus (d. 624)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Mellitus was sent to England in June 601 by Gregory<ref name=Coming64>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 64</ref> in response to an appeal from [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the first Archbishop of Canterbury, for more clergy to join the [[Gregorian mission]] which was converting the kingdom of Kent under King [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent]].<ref name=Brooks9>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 9</ref> Accompanying the group of new missionaries was a present of books and "all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church."<ref name=Bede85>[[Bede]] ''A History of the English Church and People'' p. 85<U+2013>86</ref><ref name=Coming62>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 62</ref> A 15th century Canterbury chronicler claimed that there were a number of books brought to England by Mellitus still at Canterbury in his day, but examination of the remaining manuscripts has determined that the only possible survivor of Mellitus' books is the [[St. Augustine Gospels]], now Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 286.<ref name=DNB/>

The historian Ian Wood feels that the journey Mellitus made through Gaul probably traveled through Vienne, Arles, Lyons, Toulon, Marseilles, Metz, Paris, and Rouen, among other bishoprics. The evidence for this is the letters that Gregory wrote to various bishops soliciting their support for Mellitus' party. Gregory also wrote to the Frankish kings [[Chlothar II]], [[Theuderic II]], [[Theudebert II]], along with [[Brunhild]], Theudebert and Theuderic's grandmother who was their regent. Wood feels that this wide appeal to the Frankis episcopate and royalty was an effort to secure more support for the Gregorian mission.<ref name=Wood6>Wood "Mission of Augustine" ''Speculum'' p. 6</ref>

==Bishop of London==

Mellitus was consecrated in 604 by Augustine as [[bishop]]<ref name=Hanbook219>Fryde, et. al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 219</ref> in the province of the [[East Saxon|East Saxons]], which had a capital at London, making him the first [[Bishop of London]].<ref name=Brooks11>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 11<U+2013>13a</ref> Mellitus baptised [[Saebert of Essex]], <U+00C6>thelberht's nephew, and Saebert then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church which was built in London was probably founded by <U+00C6>thelberht, rather than Saebert, but a charter that claims to be a grant of lands from <U+00C6>thelberht to Mellitus is a forgery.  Mellitus attended a council of bishops in Italy in February 610, held by Pope [[Boniface IV]].<ref name=DNB/> Boniface had him bring back two papal letters to England, one to <U+00C6>thelbert and his people, and another to [[Laurence of Canterbury|Lawrence]], the archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=Brooks13>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 13</ref> He also brought back the synod's decrees to England.<ref name=Blair86>Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 86<U+2013>87</ref> No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> While he was bishop, Mellitus and [[Justus]], the bishop of Rochester, subscribed a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of [[Easter]].<ref name=ASE112>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 112</ref>

Mellitus was driven from London by Saebert's heathen sons in 616,<ref name=Hindley36>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 36</ref> which Bede says happened because he refused the brothers request for a taste of the sacramental bread. This was after the death of Saebert, as well as <U+00C6>thelberht of Kent, which left the Gregorian mission without strong patrons.<ref name=DNB/> He fled to [[Gaul]] but was recalled to Britain by [[Laurence of Canterbury|St. Laurence of Canterbury]], the second Archbishop of Canterbury. However, he did not return to London,<ref name=ASE>Lapidge "Mellitus" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> because the East Saxons remained pagan.<ref name=DNB/>

==Archbishop and death==

Upon Laurence's death in 619, Mellitus succeeded him as the third Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=Handbook213>Fryde, et. al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 213</ref> Gregory addressed a letter to Melitus that dealt with the issue of pagan temples and festivals, urging the reuse of temples.<ref name=DNB/> It was while he was archbishop that he supposedly performed a miracle in 623 by diverting a fire that had started in [[Canterbury]] and was threatening the church. Mellitus was carried into the flames, which caused the winds to change direction, saving the church.<ref name=Brooks30>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 30</ref> Other than the miracle, little happened during his time as archbishop, with Bede praising his sane mind.<ref name=Hindley43>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 43</ref>

He died on 24 April 624<ref name=Handbook213/> and was buried at [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in Canterbury on the same day.<ref name=DNB/> After his death, he was revered as a saint, with a feast day of 24 April.<ref name=Walsh420>Walsh ''A New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 420</ref> He was still venerated in 1120 at St Augustine's, along with a number of other local saints.<ref name=Father>Hayward "An Absent Father" ''Journal of Medieval History'' p. 217 footnote 72</ref> Bede praised Mellitus, even though he says that Mellitus suffered from gout.<ref name=Blair86/>
