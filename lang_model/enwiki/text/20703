'''''St. Anger''''' is the eighth studio album by [[United States|American]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]], released on [[June 5]], [[2003]] (see [[2003 in music]]). The album was originally to be released on [[June 10]], [[2003]], but because of fears of extended [[music piracy]] over [[filesharing]] networks {{Fact|date=April 2007}}, ''St. Anger'' was released five days earlier. The album hit number 1 in 30 countries,<ref>''Some Kind of Monster'' Documentary, (2004), Chart Details for St. Anger</ref> including the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and Canadian Albums Chart. Sales did not remain stable in the US, however, with the album selling only two million copies, the band's lowest-selling album there. In 2004 lead single "[[St. Anger (song)|St. Anger]]" earned a [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]]".

''St. Anger'' represents the last collaboration between Metallica and their longtime producer [[Bob Rock]], with the announcement in early 2006 that [[Rick Rubin]] would assume production duties on their forthcoming album.

==History and reception==
Five and a half years elapsed between the release of the band's previous studio album, ''[[ReLoad]]'', and the recording of ''St. Anger'', which began in 2002. Many factors contributed to this delay, including the departure of bassist [[Jason Newsted]], the band's feud with file-sharing service [[Napster]], and vocalist/guitarist [[James Hetfield]]'s several months in rehab for [[alcoholism]] and other unspecified substance abuse. The film ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' documents that relationships between the band members in the lead-up to the album's recording were at an all-time low.

The band began initial writing for the album in April 2001, when they rented out and converted an army barrack in the [[Presidio of San Francisco|The Presidio]] in [[San Francisco, California]], converting it into a makeshift studio.<ref>''Some Kind of Monster'' Documentary, (2004)</ref> Uncomfortable with the idea of bringing in an immediate replacement for Newsted, the band opted to have producer [[Bob Rock]] play [[bass guitar]] for the recording of the album, with plans to find a fulltime bass player upon the record's completion. Recording came to a halt in July 2001 when the band announced via its website that James Hetfield had entered a rehab center for treatment of alcoholism and other addictions. Prior to the album's release, [[Lars Ulrich]] would leave videos and audio of himself discussing the new album on the band's blog, jumpinthestudio.com (no longer working).

The album met mixed reviews. Fans posting on an online website devoted to heavy metal considered the album a disaster <ref>[[Encyclopaedia Metallum]] St. Anger Reviews [http://www.metal-archives.com/review.php?id=19333]</ref>. One review stated that the album was unpolished and seemed under-produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/19856-st-anger?artist_title=19856-st-anger

}}</ref> The band adopted a different approach to the recording process, opting for an extremely stripped down and raw production quality. Producer Bob Rock noted that the aim was to capture the atmosphere of a band jamming together in a garage for the first time and the band just happened to be Metallica.<ref>''Some Kind of Monster'' Documentary, (2004)</ref> Drum rattles gave listeners a challenging sound, different from previous Metallica albums and unheard of from such an established act. The album also had a complete absence of guitar solos. Some critics praised the album for its aggression, with one critic noting that "while it's an ungodly mess at times", "what you hear on this album is a band playing with the passion for the first time in years".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/22409/metallica-stanger/

}}</ref> Longtime artist [[Pushead]] designed the cover artwork, marking the first album cover he'd done for the band, although his work had been featured previously inside the ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice For All]]'' booklet, several single covers, and numerous T-shirt designs.

After Summer Sanitarium, the year-long [[Madly in Anger with the World Tour]] followed, finishing near the end of 2004. The songs "[[Frantic (song)|Frantic]]", "[[St. Anger (song)|St. Anger]]", "Dirty Window", and "[[The Unnamed Feeling]]" were performed frequently during the tour. "Sweet Amber" and "[[Some Kind of Monster (song)|Some Kind of Monster]]" were also played live, but not as often as the other St.Anger material. The album tracks were altered when played live. Sometimes shortened, or in some cases a guitar solo was added ("Sweet Amber", "Dirty Window", "Frantic") However, in some cases only one song from the album was played live, and in 2006 the album had almost completely been removed from live sets with most shows not including any songs from St. Anger, [[Load (album)|Load]] or [[ReLoad]] (with the exception of [[Fuel (song)|Fuel]] from ReLoad).
 
In May 2007, the album was featured in Q magazines "10 Most Insane Albums Ever"; due to James Hetfield's recording hours, alcohol problems and the departure of Jason Newsted, then underneath a section of the article with the heading: "Is It Any Good?"; it says the production is "tinny" and that the songs "just aren't good enough" and says that Hetfield's singing is out of key.

A film called ''[[Some Kind of Monster (film)|Some Kind of Monster]]'' was released after St. Anger which recorded the production of the album, offering insight into how the band produced the music and how they got along during its creation.
