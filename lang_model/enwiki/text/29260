'''Harald V''' (born 21 February 1937) is the [[king of Norway]]. He succeeded to the throne of [[Norway]] upon the death of his father [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]] on 17 January 1991. The son of the then-[[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] and of [[M<U+00E4>rtha of Sweden|Princess M<U+00E4>rtha of Sweden]], Harald was born at the Crown Prince Residence at [[Skaugum]], [[Asker]].

A member of the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg]], originally from Northern Germany, Harald became the first [[Norway|Norwegian]]-born prince since [[Olaf IV of Norway|Olav IV]], who was born in 1370. Harald V is the formal head of the [[Church of Norway]] and the [[Norwegian Defence Force|Norwegian Armed Forces]].

Harald has two sisters: [[Princess Ragnhild of Norway|Princess Ragnhild]] (born 1930), who lives in [[Brazil]], and [[Princess Astrid of Norway|Princess Astrid]] (born 1932), who lives in Oslo.

He's 8th in line in the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg line of succession|line of succession]] to the headship of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl<U+00FC>cksburg.

As he is the great-grandson of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], he is also in the [[line of succession to the British throne]] (as of 2009, the 63rd in line). He is a second cousin to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] and also a maternal first cousin to [[Albert II of Belgium]].

==Childhood and education==
When Prince Harald was born in Skaugum he was the first heir to the throne of Norway to be born in Norway for several hundred years. The young prince was baptised in the Royal Chapel in the Royal Palace in Oslo on 31 March by bishop Johan Lunde.

In 1940 the entire royal family had to flee their homes because of the [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|German invasion]]. The dramatic journey northbound was marked by the Germans' repeated attempts to kill the King through bombing. It was deemed safer for the family to split up. The King and Crown Prince Olav would remain in Norway and the Crown Princess was to make her way to Sweden with the three children. The latter party reached Sweden on the night of 10 April, but although Crown Princess M<U+00E4>rtha was Swedish-born, they encountered problems at the border station. According to Princess Astrid and others who were present, they were admitted only after the driver threatened to ram the border gate. Another account does not describe the escape so dramatically.<ref name="Hegge">Hegge, Per Egil; Harald V, En biografi; N.W. Damm & S<U+00F8>n AS; 2006</ref> However when the King and Crown Prince inquired of Swedish foreign minister [[Christian G<U+00FC>nther]] whether they could sleep one night in Sweden without being interned, they were denied.<ref name="Hegge" />

Prince Harald spent the following days in [[S<U+00E4>len]] before relocating to [[Prince Carl, Duke of <U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland|Prince Carl Bernadotte's]] home in [[Fr<U+00F6>tuna]] on 16 April. On 26 April the group moved to [[Drottningholm]] in Stockholm. Accounts tell us that [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V]] had an amicable relationship with his Norwegian guests, but the topic of the war in Norway was not to be raised. However, influential Swedish politicians including Minster of Justice [[Karl Gustaf Westman|Westman]] wanted the Crown Princess and Prince Harald to be sent back to Norway so he could be proclaimed King by the Germans.<ref name="Hegge"/><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kidnapper Foiled? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764542,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher= |date= 2 September 1940 |accessdate=17 January 2009 }}</ref> After the King and Crown Prince had to leave Norway on 7 June they felt Sweden might not be the best place for the rest of the family. They started planning for them to be relocated to the USA. On 17 August the Crown Princess and her children left for the USA from [[Petsamo]], [[Finland]] aboard the ship ''[[USS American Legion (APA-17)|American Legion]]''.<ref name="Hegge" />

Harald and his mother and sisters lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] during the war,<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Non-Political Campaign |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764591-2,00.html |work=Time Magazine |publisher= |page=2 |date=9 September 1940 |accessdate=17 January 2009 }}</ref> while his father, Prince Olav, and his grandfather,  King Haakon, stayed in London with the Norwegian government-in-exile. One of the notable events he remembers from that time is standing behind [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] when he was sworn in for his fourth term on the South Portico of the [[White House]] in 1945. Such childhood experiences are reflected in a trace of an American accent when he speaks English.<ref name="nyt1971">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C14F83D591A7493C6A8178AD95F458785F9&scp=1&sq=akihito%20%20and%20Windsor&st=cse "Those Apprentice Kings and Queens Who May -- One Day -- Ascend a Throne,"] ''New York Times.'' November 14, 1971.</ref> The Doris Kearns Goodwin book ''No Ordinary Time: Franking and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Home Front in World War II'' contains a picture of the King (Then Prince) playing with FDR's dog, Fala, on the North Lawn of the White House in 1944.

Prince Harald visited Norwegian servicemen on training in the United States.  The prince also visited outside America, travelling north to visit Norwegians training in Canada's "Little Norway" in Ontario, Canada. He attended The [[White Hall Country School]] from 1943. Prince Harald returned to Norway along with his family at the war's end in 1945.

In the autumn of 1945 he was enrolled in third grade of [[Smestad skole]] as the first royal to attend a public school. In  1955 he graduated from [[Oslo katedralskole]] and in the autumn of that year, Harald began studies at the [[University of Oslo]]. Later he attended the Cavalry Officers' Candidate School at [[Trandum]]<!--in [[Ullensaker]], but we should write a small article about Trandum as well-->, followed by enrollment at the [[Norwegian Military Academy]], from which he graduated in 1959.

In 1960, Harald entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]] where he studied history, economics and politics.<ref name="nyt1971"/>  He was a keen rower during his student days at Oxford. In 1960 he also made his first official journey abroad, visiting the [[United States]] in connection with the fiftieth anniversary of the [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation|American Scandinavian Foundation]].

The Crown Prince of Norway serves as deputy of the King from the day he is 18 years of age. Crown Prince Harald attended Council of State for the first time on 27 September 1957 and took the oath to the Constitution of Norway on 21 February 1958. In the same year he also served as regent in the King's absence for the first time.

Harald married a [[commoner]], [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Sonja Haraldsen]], at [[Oslo Domkirke]] in [[Oslo]] on 29 August 1968, a marriage that sparked much public controversy. The couple have two children, [[Princess M<U+00E4>rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M<U+00E4>rtha Louise]] and His Royal Highness [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon]], heir to the Norwegian throne. 

The King heads the government meetings at Oslo Palace every Friday (Council of State). He also has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. He receives foreign envoys, and opens parliament every September. According to the Norwegian constitution, he appoints his government. Since 1884 parliamentarism has been in place in Norway, so the government has to have support from Parliament. The King appoints the leader of the parliamentary block with majority as prime minister. When the parliamentary situation is unclear the king relies on the advice of the president of Parliament and the sitting prime minister. He travels extensively throughout Norway and makes official [[List of state visits made by King Harald V of Norway|state visits]] to other countries. He is the source of all honours in the kingdom, and is the Grand Master of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]].

With his sailing crew he won World Championship bronze, silver and gold medals, in 1988, 1982, and 1987, respectively. In July 2005, the King and his crew aboard the royal sailboat ''Fram XV'' won the gold medal at the European Championships in Sweden. In the 2007 World Championship the King obtained a sixth place.<ref>[http://www.sb.no/article/20070818/NTBS/2098715440 Sandefjords Blad on the King's performance in the World Championship] {{no icon}} Retrieved 10. September 2007</ref>

Twice during recent years King Harald has been absent as ruler owing to hospitalization and convalescence: in December 2003 to mid-April 2004 due to urinary bladder cancer, and in April to early June 2005 due to aortic stenosis (for details see "The King's health", below). Crown Prince Haakon served as the country's [[regent]] on both occasions.

==Health==
<!-------->
<!--Note--"Infobox UKkingstyles" creates far too much clutter to be included in this article!-->
<!-------->
On 1 December 2003, King Harald was announced to be suffering from [[bladder cancer]].  A successful operation took place on 8 December at Norway's National Hospital, ''[[Rikshospitalet]]'', in Oslo: his bladder was removed and a new one constructed. The King was then on sick leave from all official duties.  [[Crown Prince Haakon]] was Norway's [[regent]] during King Harald's illness and convalescence.  The King resumed his duties on 13 April 2004.

[[Image:Harald of Norway.jpg|left|thumb|240px|The King and Queen, greeted by [[Laura Bush|Laura]] and [[George W. Bush]] at the [[White House]] during the March 2005 State Visit to the U.S.]]
The King was once known to be a [[tobacco smoking|chain-smoker]], but quit that habit entirely when he was diagnosed with cancer.

On 1 April 2005 Harald underwent successful [[cardiac surgery|heart surgery]], an aortic valve replacement, correcting his [[aortic stenosis]]. It had been known for some time that he had this condition; however, until early 2005 it had only been of a moderate degree. During the three-hour operation at ''Rikshospitalet'' the doctors also performed a [[coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]] procedure on the King. On 10 April it was announced that the King had also undergone a [[pericardiocentesis]] to treat a complication of surgery, a pericardial effusion (an accumulation of fluid around the heart).

After the two operations in the spring of 2005, King Harald remained on sick leave for almost two months, Crown Prince Haakon again substituting as the country's regent. The King returned to work on 7 June, a date which carried particular significance in 2005, with Norway celebrating the [[centennial]] of the [[Union Dissolution Day|dissolution]] of the [[union between Sweden and Norway|1814&ndash;1905 union with Sweden]]. The King recuperated well enough to win the European Championships in ocean sailing just three months after his latest operation.

Following advice from his personal physician, King Harald finally decided in late 2005 to scale down his official duties, primarily effected by taking Wednesdays off and trying to keep weekends free as much as possible. However, he planned to continue attending weekend sports events of interest, and to lead Friday Cabinet meetings and carry out other constitutional duties.

==Patrilineal descent==
Harald's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

[[Patrilineal descent]] is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Harald V were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.
