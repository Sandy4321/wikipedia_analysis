[[Image:I-90 Seattle terminus.svg|right|300px|thumb|Safeco Field location near I-90 terminus]]'''Safeco Field''', sometimes referred to as '''Safeco''' or '''the Safe'''{{Fact|date=April 2009}}, is a [[retractable roof]] [[baseball stadium]] located in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[United States of America|USA]]. It is the home stadium of the [[Seattle Mariners]] [[Major League Baseball]] club, seating 47,116 for baseball. The name is sometimes written as '''SAFECO Field''', as its [[Safeco|namesake corporation's]] name was actually an [[acronym]] and was rendered in all [[capital letters]] until 2000. 

Safeco Field is one of 2 stadiums built to replace the [[Kingdome]], with the other being [[Qwest Field]], home of the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Seattle Seahawks]], which occupies the former Kingdome site. 

Major non-baseball events that have been held at Safeco Field include the 2001 college football [[Seattle Bowl]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] [[WrestleMania XIX]], which set Safeco Field's attendance record of 54,097 in 2003.

==Location and transportation==
Safeco Field is located in the [[SoDo, Seattle, Washington|SoDo]] district of downtown Seattle, bounded by First Avenue S. to the west, and [[Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez]] Drive S. (formerly S. Atlantic Street)<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/193302_edgarstreet01.html Seattle to rename street after Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to the south, S. Royal Brougham Way to the north, and [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] [[railroad tracks]] to the east. The stadium is located near the western terminus of [[Interstate 90]]. 

Parking is available at the stadium's parking garage is located across Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez Drive, as well as other privately operated lots in the area. Public transportation is available along the arterial streets surrounding the stadium. Additionally, the Mariners sponsored a bus shuttle service operated by [[King County Metro]] before and after most games through 2008, as well as [[Sounder commuter rail]] service to nearby [[King Street Station (Seattle)|King Street Station]] before and after weekend afternoon games.  The Metro shuttle service was suspended in 2009 due to a new [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA) rule  <ref>http://metro.kingcounty.gov/up/spclevent/mariners-regservice.html</ref>. [[Sound Transit|Sound Transit's]] [[Central Link]] [[light rail]] system is scheduled to begin service to the stadium area on July 18, 2009 <ref>http://www.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/Project-Updates/Link-Grand-Opening.xml</ref>.

==History==
On March 30, 1994, [[King County, Washington|King County]] executive [[Gary Locke (politician)|Gary Locke]] appointed a task force to assess the need for a new baseball stadium to replace the rapidly-deteriorating [[Kingdome]]. Many feared that the Mariners would leave Seattle if a new stadium was not built. In January 1995, the 28-member task force recommended to the King County Council that the public should be involved in the financing of the stadium. The task force concluded that a sales tax increase of .01% would be sufficient to fund the stadium. King County held a special election in September 1995, asking the public for this sales tax increase. The measure was narrowly defeated.

On the baseball field that same month, the Mariners mounted a late-season comeback after being as many as 13 games out of first place and won their first [[American League West]] division title after winning a [[1995 American League West tie-breaker game|one-game tiebreaker]] against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]. They went on to defeat the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1995 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]], a series that was clinched on a memorable 11th inning [[double (baseball)|double]] by [[Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez]]. Despite the Mariners' subsequent loss to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1995 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], the late-season comeback and postseason run renewed the public's interest in keeping the team in Seattle. In particular, Martinez' double is known in Seattle today simply as "[[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|The Double]]" (<U+00E0> la [[Willie Mays]]' "[[The Catch (baseball)|The Catch]]") and is regarded by many as having "saved baseball in Seattle".

A special session of the [[Washington State Legislature]] was called, and on [[October 14]], a new revenue package was authorized. The stadium would be funded by a credit against the state sales tax, [[Washington's Lottery]] funds, a .5% restaurant and bar tax, special license plates, and stadium admissions tax. The next week, the King County Council voted to approve this measure and created the Public Facilities District, which would own the stadium and oversee its construction.

On September 9, 1996, the site was selected for the new stadium, just south of the Kingdome. In late fall, several members of the King County Council wrote a letter to the Seattle Mariners, stating that they did not believe that public money should fund this project. In response, the Seattle Mariners held a news conference stating that they would either sell the team, or move the team from Seattle. After a public outcry, the King County Council voted to reaffirm their cooperation with the Mariners in building a new stadium.

Construction officially began on [[March 8]], [[1997]] with a groundbreaking ceremony featuring Mariners star [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]  The construction continued until July [[1999]].  The first game in the new stadium was played on [[July 15]], [[1999]] against the [[San Diego Padres]]. The Padres won 3-2.

Before the stadium was initially christened, the [[naming rights]] to the stadium were sold for advertising.  Seattle-based [[Safeco]] [[insurance]] company paid $2 million for the naming rights for the ballpark's first 20 years.  However, the acquisition of the Safeco company by [[Boston]]-based [[Liberty Mutual Group]] has opened the distant possibility that the name could be changed before the contract expires in [[2019]].  However, experts speculate this will only happen if Liberty Mutual retires the Safeco name during that time.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2004369897_safecofield24.html "Mariners expect Safeco Field's name will not be changed"]</ref>

When Ken Griffey, Jr., returned to Safeco in 2007 with the [[Cincinnati Reds]], he came to a hero's welcome, receiving gifts from the Mariners organization, and fellow former players [[Jay Buhner]] and [[Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez]]. They unveiled a new poster that declared Safeco Field "The House That Griffey Built." The series was also noteworthy for the beginning of the Rally Fries tradition at Mariners games.

==Features==
[[Image:View from the top row, Safeco Field.JPG|right|250px|thumb| View of Safeco Field from the top left-field.]]
Like most ballparks built from the 1990s onward, Safeco Field is a 'retro-modern' style ballpark that incorporates many of the features of ballparks built in the 1950s and earlier with modern amenities. In contrast with the Kingdome and the other [[multi-purpose stadium]]s built primarily during the 1960s and 1970s, Safeco Field featured a brick fa<U+00E7>ade, an asymmetrical field dimension, a natural grass field, and spectator sightlines more suited for baseball, and is surrounded by city streets and/or buildings. On a modern note, the ballpark features a retractable roof, [[luxury suite]]s, extensive food and beverage selection beyond traditional ballpark fare, and modern clubhouse amenities for players, as well as technology that allows spectators to order food delivered to their seat from their cell phone or [[Nintendo DS]], and is fully [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]]-accessible.

Unlike the Kingdome, whose small dimensions gave it a reputation as a hitter's park, Safeco Field has a reputation for being very friendly to pitchers.  

===Layout===
The stadium has four main gates open to all ticket holders during Mariners games, located at the southwest, northwest, northeast, and southeast corners. These are identified as Home Plate, Left Field, Center Field, and Right Field, respectively. Entry to all ticket holders is also available through the Mariners Team Store off First Avenue. Special entrances for media and holders of certain ticket levels are located on the southwest and south sides of the stadium.

There are five main levels to the stadium: Field (or Street), Main Concourse (100 level), Club Level (200 level), Suite Level, and Upper Concourse (300 level). As the field is approximately at street level, entry into any of the main gates requires visitors to ascend a flight of stairs, escalator, or elevator to access the main concourse, with the exception of Right Field, which opens onto the main concourse. Stairs, escalators, elevators, and ramps located around the ballpark provide access to all levels.

===Food service===
Safeco Field has an extensive food and beverage selection above and beyond the traditional ballpark fare of hot dogs, pizza, soda, and beer. Concession stands selling traditional ballpark fare are plentiful on the main and upper concourses. Food courts behind home plate on the main concourse, as well as in the Bullpen Market located on the street level inside the Center Field gate, sell items such as [[sushi]] (including the "Ichiroll"), burritos, teriyaki, and barbecue. An extensive selection of beer can also be found in those locations, as well as a location on the upper concourse. 

Several restaurants and food services are available exclusively for fans purchasing certain ticket levels:
*The Diamond Club is located on the field level behind home plate. Diamond Club seats are located in the first eight rows behind home plate; holders of these seats are entitled to VIP parking in the Safeco Field garage, a private entry to the ballpark on the field level, and access to the Diamond Club Lounge with buffet and bar. The lounge is decorated with [[Babe Ruth]] memorabilia. Diamond Club seats are only sold on a full-season basis.
*70 group and individual suites occupy an entire level of the ballpark. Open only to holders of suite level tickets, each suite features a private wait staff and concierge service. Holders of suite level tickets are also entitled to a private entry to the ballpark. Suite level tickets are available on a full-season, partial season, or individual game basis.
*The Wells Fargo Terrace Club occupies another entire level of the ballpark. Open only to holders of Terrace Club seats and certain other ticket levels, the club features two lounges and wait service to each seat. As with suite level tickets, holders of Terrace Club seats are also entitled to a private entry to the ballpark. Terrace Club seats are also available on full-season, partial season, or individual game basis.
*The Hit it Here Caf<U+00E9> is located in right field, on the same level as the Terrace Club. Open to all visitors before game time on a first-come, first-served basis (though season ticket holders may make reservations), the caf<U+00E9> is only open to holders of tickets in the caf<U+00E9> during games. Hit it Here Caf<U+00E9> tickets are only sold on an individual game basis.

Safeco Field will be making certain sections a peanut free zone on Aug. 5, 2008 and Sept. 9, 2008. The stadium staff there is planning to make two sections "peanut-controlled" zones, cleaning each before the game and banning the sale of peanuts at nearby concession stands so those afflicted by the food allergy can watch the game without worry. The St. Louis Cardinals and Minnesota have also set aside peanut-free sections during the 2008 season, but the concept is not limited to the big leagues. A minor league team in suburban Chicago has made its entire stadium peanut-free partway through the current season and the Nashua Pride in New Hampshire have been peanut-free for the entire year.

===Retractable roof===
[[Image:Retractable roof open, Safeco Field.JPG|right|250px|thumb| View of Safeco Field with retractable roof open.]]
Safeco Field has a unique retractable roof that only acts as an "[[umbrella]]" for the stands and field rather than forming a complete climate-controlled enclosure, as is the case with all other retractable roofs in MLB. Seattle's relatively mild climate means the park rarely needs to be heated or cooled, but frequent precipitation necessitated a roof. The only other covered baseball stadium in the world with permanent openings is the fixed-roof [[Seibu Dome]] in [[Tokorozawa, Saitama|Tokorozawa]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Japan]], home of the [[Saitama Seibu Lions]]. 

In the open position, the roof rests over the BNSF Railway tracks that bound the stadium to the east, with part of it hanging over the stands in right field. This has the effect of echoing the horns from passing trains into the stadium, a frequent occurrence with an [[at-grade intersection|at-grade]] [[railroad crossing]] at the northeast corner of the stadium and a working [[King Street Station|passenger train station]] and rail yards nearby. Consequently, train horns have become a fixture of the Safeco Field baseball game experience, for spectators and players alike. 

The roof consists of three major sections that extend into the closed position in a [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] manner, with the two outer sections resting under the larger center section. Each section rests on a set of parallel tracks located on the north and south sides of the stadium, with the outer sections moving along the inner set of tracks, and the center section moving along the outer set. Each section is structurally independent; i.e., no section depends on another for structural stability. "Welcome to Safeco Field, Seattle" is painted on top of the center section, visible from aircraft whether the roof is open or closed. A lighted "Safeco Field" sign was added to the east side of the roof in 2007, presumably to aid in identification of the stadium from the freeways to the east. 

Each section is independently powered by electric motors that move the respective sections along the tracks. It is controlled from a central control room located under the center field scoreboard. Depending on wind and weather conditions, the roof takes approximately 10 minutes to move from the fully open to the fully closed position, and vice-versa. During normal operation, the movement of each section is governed by computers, with all three sections moving at the same time. During an emergency or maintenance operation, each section can be independently moved. A working spare motor and wheel assembly for the roof can be found inside the center field gate. In its present state, it serves to educate visitors on how the roof operates, but if needed, it can be used to replace a similar part on the roof should one become damaged or defective. 

=====Ground rules surrounding the Safeco Field retractable roof=====
Batted ball striking the roof or roof [[truss]]es:
* A ball striking the roof or roof truss in fair territory is judged [[fair ball|fair]] or [[foul ball|foul]] in relation to where it lands.
* A ball striking the roof or roof truss in foul territory is a foul ball, regardless of where it lands.
* A ball striking the roof or roof truss is still considered [[in flight]], and the [[batter (baseball)|batter]] is [[out (baseball)|out]] if legally caught by a fielder, regardless of where it struck. 
Movement of the roof:
* If the game starts with the roof open, it may be closed during the game if weather conditions warrant, and at the discretion of the home team. Play may continue during closure, unless the [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] determine it is necessary to stop play. 
* If the game starts with the roof closed, it may be opened during the game if weather conditions warrant. Opening the roof can only start between innings, after notification of the umpire [[Umpire (baseball)#Duties and positions|crew chief]]. The visiting team may challenge the decision to open the roof, but final decision over whether to open the roof lies with the crew chief. The roof may only be opened once during a game.

===Scoreboards===
Safeco Field features a manual [[scoreboard#baseball|scoreboard]], a color [[LED]] video screen, a main [[monochrome|monochromatic]] matrix board, and several monochromatic information boards.
* The old-fashioned manually operated scoreboard is located in left field, and is part of the outfield fence. Signs used in the scoreboard are available for sale after use in the team store.
* Also in left field is a monochromatic out-of-town scoreboard, located above the bullpens. This scoreboard displays pitcher information when a [[relief pitcher]] enters the game, and identifies any pitchers that may be warming up.
* The main scoreboard in center field contains the LED video screen and large monochromatic matrix board. The matrix board shows each team's [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]], batter's statistics, [[line score]], and [[count (baseball)|count]].
* Smaller monochromatic information boards in right field display advertisements and other pertinent information, usually pertaining to pitchers.
* Monochromatic scoreboards and fixed billboards are installed on the Terrace Club fascia, from near home plate down the left and right field lines. The scoreboards display the same information down the left and right field lines. They show, in order from home plate:
** Score (runs only) and inning
** Batter information and [[Count (baseball)|count]]
** Outcome of previous at-bats of the current inning (this board shows the Safeco Field logo and time of day for the first at bat of the inning)
** Pitcher name, pitch count, and pitch speed.
** Time of day
* A monochromatic numerical display in the left field corner shows the distance of a home run after one is hit.
Additionally, television screens showing the local telecast of the game hang from the bottom of the Terrace Club level, for spectators seated in the last several rows of the main concourse seating areas, as well as those standing on the main concourse. Though fans in these areas have a full view of the field, their view of the scoreboards is obstructed by the overhang of the Terrace Club level. These screens display the content shown on the video board between innings or when the telecast is on a commercial break.

===Art in the Park===
Safeco Field and its adjoining parking garage feature extensive public art displays, including:
*[[Chandelier]] made of 1,000 resin baseball bats
*"Quilts" depicting each MLB team logo, made from recycled metal including [[Vehicle registration plates of the United States|license plates]] from the respective teams' states.
*[[Stainless steel]] cutouts of players in various poses while [[catcher (baseball)|catching]], [[batter (baseball)|batting]], [[baseball positions|fielding]], and [[pitcher (baseball)|pitching]], integrated into the fences at the stadium's four main gates. 
*Sculptures depicting hands gripping baseballs for various types of [[pitch (baseball)|pitches]].
*Nine-foot tall bronze [[baseball glove]] that has become an icon for Safeco Field.
* Mural depicting [[Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez|Edgar Mart<U+00ED>nez']] famed "[[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|The Double]]".
*[[Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Seattle)|Children's Hospital]] [[Wishing Well]] which features a bronze statue of a child in batting position, and includes a geyser effect used at the beginning of games and when the Mariners hit a home run.

===Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest===
The Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest pays homage to now-defunct [[professional baseball]] teams that played in [[Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], and [[British Columbia]] before the establishment of the Mariners in {{by|1977}}. Additionally, it features hands-on displays explaining the composition of [[baseball (ball)|baseballs]] and [[Baseball Bat|bats]], and the different types of [[Baseball glove|gloves]], as well as a replica [[outfield]] fence with props to allow fans to photograph themselves pretending to be [[outfielder]]s.

===Mariners Hall of Fame===
Co-located with the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest, the [[Seattle Mariners#Mariners Hall of Fame|Mariners Hall of Fame]] features bronze plaques of the four inducted members describing their contributions to the franchise, as well as murals and television screens showing highlights of their careers with the Mariners.

===Other Features===
The flagship Mariners Team Store is located on the west side of the stadium. The first level of the store, on the street level, sells a comprehensive assortment of Mariners merchandise, while the upper level, on the main concourse, displays game-used items for sale, as well as a custom jersey embroidery station. Other stores include the Kids' Clubhouse at the northeast corner on the main concourse, a walk-in store at the southwest corner on the upper concourse, and kiosks throughout the ballpark.

[[Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Seattle)|Children's Hospital]] Playfield is a playground for children located at the northeast corner of the stadium on the main concourse. Also located in this area is "Moose's Munchies", a concession stand selling ballpark fare in child-sized portions.

The Moose Den, located on the main concourse near the Children's Hospital Playfield, is a meet-and-greet area for the [[Mariner Moose]], the team's mascot. 

The stadium houses a [[Ben & Jerry's]] ice cream shop facing First Avenue near the northwest corner of the stadium. The entire interior of the shop is only accessible from outside the stadium gates; however, service is provided inside the stadium through a window on the street level just inside the Left Field gate.

An [[clock#analog clocks|analog clock]] is integrated into the Mariners' [[compass rose]] logo above the left field [[bleachers]]. 

Safeco Field also gives walking tours of the stadium for a small fee. Departing from the main Team Store, the tour includes information about the stadium not generally provided at games, as well as entry into areas not open to the general public during games, including the visitors' clubhouse, playing field and dugouts, press box, and a luxury suite.
