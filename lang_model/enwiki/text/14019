In 1940 and 1941, Shaughnessy had coached at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]. There he installed a pass-oriented version of the [[T-formation]] and, in his first year, engineered a turnaround from a 1<U+2013>7<U+2013>1 record to a perfect 10<U+2013>0 season and [[Pacific Coast Conference]] championship.<ref>[http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=40060 Clark Shaughnessy Member Biography], [[College Football Hall of Fame]], retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> While Maryland's head coach, Shaughnessy also worked concurrently as an advisor for the [[Washington Redskins]], with that club and Maryland sharing the cost of his salary.<ref name="tales"/> Shaughnessy helped develop Mont into a high-quality quarterback.<ref>Edwin Pope, [http://www.archive.org/stream/footballsgreates010566mbp/footballsgreates010566mbp_djvu.txt Football's Greatest Coaches], 1955, Tupper and Love, Inc., ASIN: B000NVD09E.</ref> In 1942, with Mont under [[center (American football)|center]], the Terrapins posted a 7-2 record.<ref name="results"/> That year, Mont was named an honorable mention [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] and ranked as the number-three passer in the nation.<ref name="mdhof"/><ref>[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/md/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/191-196.pdf All-Time Honors] (PDF), ''2001 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide'', CBS Sports, retrieved 8 December 2008.</ref> Mont also played [[field lacrosse|lacrosse]] for [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]] for the 1942 season.<ref name=lax>''2009 Maryland Men's Lacrosse Media Guide'', p. 65, University of Maryland, 2009.</ref>

==Military service==
Mont put his college career on hold in order to join the [[United States Army]] as an infantryman and served in the [[Second World War]]. In 1945, he coached the [[3rd Infantry Division]] football team which won the [[Seventh United States Army|7th Army]] championship. After returning to the United States, he coached the basketball and football teams at {{city-state|Fort Benning|Georgia}}.<ref name="hired"/> 

==Return to college==
After his military service, Mont returned to Maryland and played football for another season in 1946.<ref name="results"/> That season, Shaughnessy, one-time Maryland head coach in 1942, also returned from [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. Shaughnessy again worked part-time as an advisor for the [[Washington Redskins]], and he had some of the Maryland players assist him. Under the arrangement, Mont and [[Vic Turyn]] even called plays for the Redskins.<ref name="tales">David Ungrady, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kty1Jvi1j0IC Tales from the Maryland Terrapins], Sports Publishing Inc, 2003, ISBN 1582616884.</ref>

Mont graduated from Maryland with a [[bachelor of science]] degree in 1947.<ref name="hired"/> He played a second season on the lacrosse team in 1948.<ref name=lax/>

==Professional playing career==
Mont had been selected in the 12th round of the [[1944 NFL Draft]] (114th overall) by the [[New York Giants]].<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?season=1944 NFL Draft History: Full Draft], National Football League, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref><ref name="pro"/> In 1947, he went to play for the [[Washington Redskins]].<ref name="pro">[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MontTo20.htm Tommy Mont Statistics], Pro Football Reference, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> He played as a back-up quarterback for three seasons, and at one point was the number-two behind the legendary [[Sammy Baugh]].<ref name="hired">[http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=18240 Maryland's Tommy Mont Named Head Grid Coach at DePauw], DePauw University, April 29, 1959, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> In his first season, he saw action in four games, and recorded one interception on defense with a seven-yard return.<ref name="pro"/>

In 1948, he played in 11 games including two starts. He recorded 12 completions on 28 attempts for 157 yards and two touchdowns and two interceptions. He also had 11 carries for 103 yards and one touchdown. On defense, he had two interceptions for 21 yards. That season, he was the Redskins' second leading passer behind Baugh.<ref name="pro"/>

In 1949, he played in 12 games and made three of seven completions for 44 yards. He also recorded rushed 14 times for 75 yards and made eight receptions for 105 yards and two touchdowns. On defense, he recovered one fumble for a 45-yard return. That season, he was the Redskins' third leading passer behind Baugh and [[Harry Gilmer]].<ref name="pro"/>

==Coaching career==
===Early positions===
In 1949, Mont assisted at the [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga#Athletics|University of Chattanooga]], where he helped install a [[T-formation]] offense. In 1950, he served as an assistant coach with the Washington Redskins.<ref name="mdhof"/>

Mont returned to his [[alma mater]] in [[1951 Maryland Terrapins football team|1951]] to become the Maryland backfield coach under [[Jim Tatum]], and he held that position through the [[1955 Maryland Terrapins football team|1955 season]]. During that time, he also worked with the [[United States Marines Corps|U.S. Marine Corps']] [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]] football team, where he helped implement a [[split-T]] offense in 1954. Mont worked summers with [[<U+00C1>guilas Blancas|the football team]] of the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Mexico City]] from 1953 to 1955. In 1955, he also worked for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]]. In December 1958, he was a coach for the Blue team in the [[Blue-Gray Football Classic]].<ref name="hired"/>

===Maryland===
After Tatum resigned to coach at his own alma mater, [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]], Mont was appointed as his replacement in 1956.<ref>[http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/University_Maryland_Reveille_Yearbook/1959/Page_54.html Text from Page 54], ''Reveille'', University of Maryland Yearbook, p. 54, 1959, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2<U+2013>7<U+2013>1 record.<ref name="results"/><ref name="si"/> Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had,<ref>K. Adam Powell and [[Woody Durham]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=NkWTt9D_UMcC Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football], 2004, Scarecrow Press, ISBN 0810848392.</ref> but managed to secure [[Rod Breedlove]], a highly-touted [[guard (American football)|guard]] prospect.<ref name="si">[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133140/index.htm Atlantic Coast Conference], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', September 23, 1957.</ref> Breedlove later went on to play eight years in the NFL and made a [[Pro Bowl]] appearance.

In 1957, the Terrapins improved to a 5-5 record. The highlight of the season was a game featuring Jim Tatum's return to {{city-state|College Park|Maryland}}. On October 19, at [[Byrd Stadium]], Maryland met the North Carolina team led by their former head coach. The game also had in attendance [[Queen Elizabeth II]] who had expressed a wish to see her first game of American football. The Tar Heels were ranked 6th in the nation and possessed a 3<U+2013>1 record. The Terrapins, on the other hand, were 1<U+2013>3.<ref name="queen"/> In the first quarter, Maryland [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] Howard Dare [[fumble]]d and North Carolina [[linebacker]] Jack Lineberger recovered the ball on the Terrapins' 44-yard line. North Carolina was subsequently forced to [[Punt (football)|punt]], but recovered it at the Maryland 35. On the ensuing possession, Tar Heel halfback Daley Goff rushed 11 yards for a [[touchdown]]. In the third quarter, Maryland gained excellent field position when Goff received a bad punt snap and the Terps took over on the Carolina 38-yard line. Maryland quarterback Bob Rusevlyan later scored on a one-yard [[quarterback sneak|sneak]]. In the fourth quarter, [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] Ted Kershner broke away for an 81-yard touchdown run. [[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]] Jim Joyce capped a 67-yard drive with a 13-yard rush for a score. With a final result of 21<U+2013>7, the Maryland players carried Mont to the Queen and [[Prince Philip]]'s box.<ref>Bob Boyles and Paul Guido, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk976QOd-jkC 50 Years of College Football: A Modern History of America's Most Colorful Sport], 2007, Skyhorse Publishing Inc., ISBN 1602390908.</ref> Mont said it was a day that "I will revel in for the rest of my life."<ref name="queen">[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/oct/19/marylands-queen-for-a-day/ Maryland's queen for a day], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', October 19, 2007, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref>

In 1958, however, Maryland again backslided with a 4<U+2013>6 record and Mont subsequently resigned.

===DePauw===
In 1959, Mont accepted a job as head coach and a professor of physical education at [[DePauw University]].<ref name="hired"/> While there, he compiled a 67<U+2013>94<U+2013>4 record.<ref name="cfb">[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=1655 Thomas A. "Tommy" Mont Records by Year], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref> In the rivalry with [[Wabash College]], the [[Monon Bell Classic]], Mont's teams posted a 12<U+2013>5<U+2013>1 record. He was twice bestowed most outstanding conference coach honors, including in 1967, when he was named the Indiana Collegiate Conference Coach of the Year.<ref name="mdhof"/><ref name="retired">[http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=17836 Tom Mont Steps Down as Football Coach], DePauw University, February 1, 1977, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref>

==After football==
In 1972, he was appointed as the DePauw athletic director and the chairman of the department of physical education.<ref name="mdhof"/> In 1977, Mont retired as head coach to devote his full energy to his duties as athletic director.<ref name="retired"/> In 1987, he retired as athletic director.<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/news/index.asp?id=20093 Longtime Football Coach Tom Mont Still Wisecracking, Reports Phoenix Newspaper], DePauw University, September 26, 2007, retrieved January 28, 2009.</ref>
