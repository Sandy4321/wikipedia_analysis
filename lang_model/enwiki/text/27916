The 10 barangays are grouped into three (3) zones:
* Zone 1: Poblacion (Mayabo), Wayangan and Supo
* Zone 2: Tiempo, Kili, Tabacda and Amtuagan 
* Zone 3: Alangtin-Batayan, Tubtuba and Dilong

==History==

The inhabitants belong to the Maeng tribe and speak the dialect of the same name.  There is however one barangay, Tabacda, that speaks a different dialect.  This is because they are believed to have originated from Kalinga.  Everyone can understand and speak the common dialect though.

Agriculture is the main source of livelihood but various industries are starting to grow. Slash and burn farming is now less done while tree planting for commercial purposes is gaining ground.

While almost all barangays are now interconnected with a one way road network and have electricity; the others still can only be reached by foot and are using either an electric generator and or gas to light up the night.
