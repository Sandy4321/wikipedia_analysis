The '''Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department''', or '''PAPD''', is a [[law enforcement agency]] in [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. Its duties are to protect all facilities owned by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], and to enforce state and city laws at all the facilities. The PAPD is one of the largest police departments in the United States, with approximately 1,600 officers, sergeants, lieutenants, and detectives. The PAPD is owned and operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], a bi-state agency running the [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[seaport]]s along the [[New York]] - [[New Jersey]] border. 

==History==  

The Port Authority Police Force was created in June 1928 when 40 men were selected to police the [[Goethals Bridge]] and [[Outerbridge Crossing]] (then known as the Arthur Kill Bridge).
These original officers were known as Bridgemen, nine of whom were later promoted to the rank of Bridgemaster, or Sergeants

As the Port Authority facilities increased in number, so did its police force. With the opening of the [[Holland Tunnel]] in 1927, three Metropolitan Airports and a Marine Terminal in the 1940s, the force grew. In the 1950s the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] opened. The Port Authority also assumed control of the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] system, formerly known as The Hudson and Manhattan Tubes.

==Airports==

The Port Authority's police force protects three major airports,  [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International]], and [[LaGuardia Airport]], which handle over 80 million air passengers, over 1.1 million aircraft movements, and over 2.5 million tons of air cargo annually. Policing these aviation facilities involves a wide variety of duties. Police personnel cover screening points, respond to all aircraft incidents, and aid travelers from all parts of the world. Escorting and protecting visiting dignitaries is provided for on a daily basis. The PAPD also patrols the Port Authority-owned [[Teterboro Airport]] in New Jersey, which is much smaller than the other three and operates only general aviation aircraft.

The Port Authority Police are also responsible for fire fighting and crash emergency rescue at the three airports and for all other aircraft emergency incidents. Police personnel assigned to fire and rescue duty are highly trained in all phases of these functions including the operation of sophisticated and complex equipment.

==Marine terminals==

Brooklyn-Port Authority Marine Terminal facilities handle thousands of ships, and over 14.5 million tons of cargo per year. Police operations at [[Newark, New Jersey|Port Newark]]/[[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], and the [[Brooklyn]] Piers include traffic control and the prevention and investigation of cargo thefts. PAPD officers are stationed at all ports.

==Structure==

The Department's headquarters is located in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. 
The nerve center of the force is the Central Police Desk, which is located at Journal Square. It is staffed around-the-clock and is the hub of the communications network. There, personnel are assigned to needed areas, all radio transmissions are monitored, and computer terminals are integrated into the NY & NJ Intelligence and Crime Information Systems as well as the [[National Crime Information Center]] (NCIC) in [[Washington, D.C.]] Information received from these sources is supplied to officers in the field when needed.

The PATH system is one of the most intensively policed rail transit systems in the world. Approximately 200,000 passengers use the PATH system daily. The system's stations are monitored by closed circuit T.V. to aid police personnel in their patrol.

At the Holland and [[Lincoln Tunnel]]s, the Bayonne, Goethals, and [[George Washington Bridge]]s, and the Outerbridge Crossing, the Port Authority Police Officers' duties are patrol, traffic control, hazardous cargo inspections, truck weigh and emergency services, as well as enforcement for violations of motor vehicle laws. Police at these crossings have also instituted programs that maintain a constant campaign against drunk driving. The Port Authority operates the largest and busiest [[Port Authority Bus Terminal|Bus Terminal]] in the nation, accommodating 57 million bus passengers and over 2.2 million bus movements in 2001. Police assignments demand a broad range of functions, everything from locating lost children to aiding everyday commuters. They are responsible for the general security of the facility utilizing a variety of patrol tactics. Police Officer/Social Worker teams patrol the Bus Terminal and identify youngsters that may be runaways, throwaways, or missing persons. They provide crisis intervention counseling, placement with social service agencies, and reunions with families when appropriate. Port Authority Police Academy recruits typically receive 23 weeks of intensive training in New York and New Jersey law, behavioral sciences, public relations, police practices and procedures, laws of arrest, court procedures and testimony. They are also trained in rules of evidence, defensive tactics, first aid, fire fighting, police patrol and traffic duty, firearms training, defensive and pursuit driving, water safety and rescue.
Throughout their careers, Port Authority Police Officers return to the Academy both for refresher courses and for training in new techniques added to the curriculum.

The Koebel Memorial Police Firearms Training Center is dedicated to the memory of Police Officer Henry J. Koebel, who was killed in the line of duty in May of 1978. The Police Academy utilizes state-of-the-art equipment where the staff operates eighteen shooting ports within this computerized firearms training facility. Features include moveable target lights and noise controls, shoot/don't shoot situations, as well as standard marksmanship instruction.

===Criminal Investigations Bureau===

The Criminal Investigations Bureau consists of over 100 detectives and supervisors that are specifically trained for crimes occurring at transportation facilities. During the past year the Criminal Investigations Bureau has worked on computerized airline ticket fraud, and property and drug interdictions. They have seized over 10 million dollars of goods including 35 kilograms of narcotics. Additionally, the Criminal Investigations Bureau has worked cooperatively with Local, State, and Federal agencies in the fight against crime. Some of these agencies include the New Jersey State Police, the New York City Police Department, United States Customs and Border Patrol and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. Members of the Criminal Investigations Bureau also work as part of the FBI [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] to prevent terrorist activities in the region.

===Emergency Services Unit===

The Port Authority Police Emergency Services Unit was founded in 1983, ''over the objections'' of the Port Authority Police management at that time.  Working with the non-police PATH railroad personnel and railroad management, who clearly recognized the need for a rapid response to PATH railroad emergencies and fires, a small group of Port Authority Police Officers assigned to the PATH Command asked for, and got, a stock Port Authority utility truck which was converted for police emergency use. Despite the continued objections of P.A. Police management, the PATH railroad management's goal of having an "Emergency Response Vehicle" operated by the police bore fruit. The initial team members were trained in underground rescue, extrication of passengers from PATH train cars and first aid, with emphasis on the procedure of lifting railroad cars from trapped persons by use of Vetter air bags.   Prior to the PATH Emergency Unit, emergencies which occurred on the PATH train were handled by  the local police within the jurisdictions around the PATH train (Jersey City, New York, Newark, etc). 
 
Emergency Services Unit Members, who have received specialized training to respond to emergency and rescue operations that arise at Port Authority facilities or in other jurisdictions when their expertise is requested are currently assigned to various facilities throughout the Port Authority. Emergency Services Unit members may receive training in the following areas; animal control, hazardous material response, heavy weapon use, bridge and water rescue and tactical operations.
Noteworthy cases that the Emergency Services Unit has handled or other jurisdictions in handling include:
* The collapse of the World Trade Center on [[September 11, 2001]]
* The 1993 [[World Trade Center bombing]]
* The rescue of an emotionally disturbed person from a water tower in West New York, N.J.
* A General Aviation crash in the City of Newark
* The rescue of homeowners in Bound Brook, N.J. trapped by rising floodwaters caused by Hurricane Floyd in 1999
* A ceiling collapse at the Journal Square Transportation Center
* Water rescues from the PATH system in 1992
* A NJ Transit train accident in the Hackensack Meadowlands in 1996

===K-9 Unit===
The Port Authority Police Department formed its first K-9 unit with three patrol dogs; Prince, Bear, and Rex, and three police officer handlers in September 1985. There were two assigned to P.A.T.H. and one assigned to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. They were trained by the NYC Transit Police K-9 unit located in Brooklyn N.Y.They began patrol in December 1985.
The Port Authority Police Department formed its K-9 ([[police dog]]) Explosive Detection Unit in the fall of 1996 in response to the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island that summer. The department subsequently expanded the unit to include a K-9 Narcotics Detection Unit.
The K-9 unit, which consists of 45 police officers, three sergeants, one inspector and 48 dogs, patrols all Port Authority facilities on a 24-hour basis.
Port Authority Police officers who are members of the K-9 unit must pass a challenging and demanding physical, a physical agility course, participate in a group interview and complete a minimum of 400 hours of K-9 training.
The most popular dog in the unit is the German Shepherd. The unit also has Labradors, a Belgium Shepherd and a Golden Retriever. The dogs are trained to detect either explosives or narcotics, but not both.
The unit currently has 40 dogs trained to detect explosives, including 22 certified by the federal Transportation Security Administration. There are eight dogs trained in narcotics detection.
The K-9 explosive detection teams patrol and search aircraft, airline and cargo buildings, bus terminals, subway stations, vehicles, and unattended luggage and packages. The K-9 narcotic detection teams patrol and perform a variety of searches at Port Authority facilities and are also used by many other government agencies.
This unit experienced what might be the first loss ever of an American police dog due to international terrorism when Sirius[http://www.portauthoritypolicememorial.org/sirius.htm], PAPD Badge #17, died in the collapse of the World Trade Center on [[September 11, 2001]].

===Motorcycle Unit===

The Port Authority Police Department operates a motorcycle unit that consists of a sergeant and 13 police officers.
The unit is responsible for patrolling Port Authority tunnels and bridges, with the primary duties of traffic enforcement, truck checks, VIP movements and funeral details.
Each member of the unit is assigned his own motorcycle. Before joining the unit, each member must complete the Northwestern University/Harley Davidson Police Officer Training Program.

The original motorcycle unit was disbanded back in 1956 after Police Officer James Calandra was struck and killed while on motorcycle patrol.

===Firefighting and Crash Emergency===

In June 1998, the Port Authority Police Department opened a state-of-the-art Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Fuel Spill Trainer Facility at John F. Kennedy International Airport.
The facility, one of the largest of its kind in the nation, is used to train Port Authority Police officers in aircraft rescue and firefighting techniques. It allows officers to train for emergency situations in a controlled environment.
The centerpiece of the training center is a 125-foot diameter pit that uses clean-burning propane to simulate a fire. It also features a 75-foot-long aircraft mockup with a broken wing section. Computer controls allow for the creation of firefighting scenarios that vary in size, difficulty and intensity.
Each year, more than 600 Port Authority officers are cross-trained as aircraft rescue firefighters for the region's three major airports - John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, and LaGuardia airports.
Port Authority Police assigned to aircraft rescue and firefighting undergo rigorous training twice a year to achieve and maintain Federal Aviation Administration certification.

==Power and Authority==

Port Authority Police Officers are classified as [[Police Officer]]s in both [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. With the status of police officer, they are permitted to make arrests, use physical and deadly force, carry and use [[firearm]]s, carry and use [[handcuffs]], issue [[Summons|summonses]], and use physical and deadly force.

==Salary==

The PAPD is one of the highest paid police forces in the northeastern United States, thus making it one of the most coveted law enforcement jobs in the region. Under the current contract, the starting salary of police officer is $32,361, and after five years of service, the salary is $83,141, not including promotions or overtime.

With such a high salary, the PAPD has attracted many officers from neighboring departments, most specifically officers from the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref>NYPD Officers try to join PAPD http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=investigators&id=3711539</ref>

==Line of Duty Deaths==

Since the establishment of the Port Authority Police Department, 45 officers have died in the line of duty. <ref>The Officer Down Memorial Page http://www.odmp.org/agency/3173</ref>

==Terrorist attacks==

On [[February 26]], [[1993]] the Port Authority's [[World Trade Center]] complex was the target of [[World Trade Center bombing|terrorist attacks]]. On [[September 11]], [[2001]], the complex was the target of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] for a second time. 

The complex housed over 50,000 employees and accommodated 70,000 visitors per day; the efforts of the Port Authority Police, the [[New York City Police]], the [[New York City Fire Department]], New York City EMS, along with countless others helped to minimize the loss of life. The Port Authority Police suffered the worst loss of police personnel in a single event in American history: 37 police officers along with one police K-9 were killed on September 11th.
