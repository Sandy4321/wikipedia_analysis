The '''A16 road''' is a principal road of [[Lincolnshire]] in the [[East Midlands]] [[region of England]], connecting the port of [[Grimsby]] and [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]], where it meets the [[A1175 road|A1175]], [[A47 road|A47]] & [[A1139 road|A1139]] then on to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and the [[A605 road|A605]] the latter, in turn, giving a through route to [[Northampton]] and the west, and south west of England. Its length is {{convert|85|mi}}.

From north to south its route is:
*[[Grimsby]]
*[[Utterby]]
*[[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] (now bypassed)
*[[Burwell, Lincolnshire|Burwell]]
*[[Walmsgate]]
*[[Dalby, Lincolnshire|Dalby]]
*[[Partney]] (now bypassed)
*[[Spilsby]]
*[[East Keal]]
*[[Keal Cotes]]
*[[Stickford]]
*[[Stickney, Lincolnshire|Stickney]]
*[[Sibsey]]
*[[Hilldyke]]
*[[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]
*[[Wyberton]]
*[[Kirton, Lincolnshire|Kirton]] (now bypassed)
*[[Surfleet]]
*[[Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire|Pinchbeck]] (now bypassed)
*[[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] (now bypassed)
*[[Crowland, Lincolnshire]]
*[[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]]

Although it has 'primary route' designation for its entire length virtually none of the A16 is [[dual carriageway]] and there are speed restrictions on much of it.

The {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} <U+00A3>1.2&nbsp;million [[Ludborough]] Bypass opened in November 1992. The {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} [[Fotherby]] Bypass opened in 2004. The {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} <U+00A3>6.6&nbsp;million Louth Bypass opened in August 1991. The {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} Partney Bypass opened in August 2005. From [[West Keal]] to Boston, the road is very flat. The {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million [[Stickford]] Bypass opened in October 1992. The <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;million Boston Inner Relief Road opened in early 1978. There are demands for Boston to be bypassed. The {{convert|6|mi|adj=on}} <U+00A3>11.5&nbsp;million Boston-[[Algarkirk]] Diversion opened in October 1991. The {{convert|11|mi|adj=on}} <U+00A3>23&nbsp;million Spalding-[[Sutterton]] Improvement (the Spalding Bypass) opened in August 1995.

==Spalding-Peterborough route change==

The route of the A16 has changed following the completion of the new Spalding-Peterborough link road. The section between Spalding to the south of Crowland only, opened in August 2010; the remainder was completed in October 2011. The new route has taken the number A16, effectively linking the route with Peterborough, with the current road from Spalding to Stamford becoming the [[A1175 road|A1175]].<ref name="A1175">[http://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/Chance-to-see-route-of.4524659.jp Chance to see route of <U+00A3>69.8 million road from Spalding to Eye], Lincs. Free Press, 25 September 2008</ref>

This new section replaced the A1073 road, a road that ran between the former A16 at {{coord|52|45.5262|N|0|9.6174|W|region:GB}} {{convert|1.3|km|mi|disp=flip}} south of [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] in [[Lincolnshire]] and the [[A47 road (Great Britain)|A47]] between [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]] and [[Eye Green]] at {{coord|52|36.7206|N|0|11.1378|W|region:GB}} in [[Cambridgeshire]].

The A1073 route had become increasingly dangerous over the years because traffic usage had increased. It was narrow with many blind corners and slopes, and much of it was on an embankment with deep ditches either side and no run-off areas. There were dangerous junctions, particularly with the B1443 between [[Peakirk]] and [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]], which formed a staggered [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]]. The road was a principal route servicing the food-processing industry in Spalding, bringing in supplies and moving products to the [[supermarket]] distribution system to the south.

An upgrade to the route had been under discussion for many years. The main hold-up was arguments over funding between Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and the [[Department for Transport]], exacerbated by the actions of a former Leader of Lincolnshire County Council who went to jail for seeking to influence the route to his own financial advantage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/leicestershire/3594421.stm|title=BBC report of trial of council leader | work=BBC News | date=2004-04-02}}</ref> Eventually a route was agreed, avoiding [[Cowbit]] and [[Crowland]] and joining the A47 west of [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]], and in 2008 construction work began, originally due to be completed by Autumn 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/7264253.stm |title=Work starts on <U+00A3>80m road scheme | work=BBC News | date=2008-02-26 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fsd.lincolnshire.gov.uk/section.asp?sectiontype=listmixed&catid=15020|title=A1073 - Spalding to Eye Improvement Scheme|work=Lincolnshire County Council|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>

The Northern {{convert|13.4|km|mi||disp=flip}} of the new route opened between Spalding and the roundabout south of Crowland in Autumn 2010, with the opening of the Southern {{convert|7.7|km|mi||disp=flip}} delayed due to structural problems at the embankment at [[Car Dyke]] Bridge. On completion of remedial repairs and the opening of the Southern portion on 16 October 2011, the new road was renumbered to form part of the A16; the original A1073 alignment between Spalding and Eye Green became an unclassified [[local road]].<ref name="A1175">[http://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/Chance-to-see-route-of.4524659.jp Chance to see route of <U+00A3>89 million road from Spalding to Eye], Lincs.
