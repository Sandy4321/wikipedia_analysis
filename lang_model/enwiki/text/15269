Each year, [[record company|record companies]] compete for the '''[[Christmas]] [[List of number-one singles (UK)|number one single]]''' spot on the [[UK Singles Chart|British charts]]. Having the UK Christmas number one is very prestigious and leads to a lot of media coverage. Since people are buying gifts for the Christmas period, single sales are extremely high in the week before Christmas, and since the Christmas number one is the single with the highest sales, record companies can make sizable profit from trying to get their single to Number One. Many people place bets at a [[bookmaker|bookmaker's]] on who will be Christmas number one.

It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when the subject of the Christmas number one began to excite significant media coverage. However some believe it dates back to [[1973]], when two of the most successful bands of the day - [[Slade]] and [[Wizzard]] - both released Christmas-related singles ("[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]" and "[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday]]" respectively) in an attempt to clinch the festive chart-topper, with Slade ultimately coming out on top.

The definition of the Christmas number one single is the entry at the top of the official UK singles chart released on the Sunday before Christmas Day, or Christmas Day itself if it falls on a Sunday. (The weekly charts are announced on Sundays covering the sales from the previous week.) Therefore, if Christmas Day falls at the end of the week, records bought in the last few days before Christmas do not play a part in determining the "Christmas Number One".  

The Christmas number one formerly went most often to sentimental, Christmas-related or [[novelty songs]] - a fact parodied in the plot of the movie ''[[Love Actually]]'' - although this has become rarer in recent years.

The race for the Christmas number-one of 2002 was focused on by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV]] television programme ''[[Popstars|Popstars: the Rivals]]'', a reality TV show that formed an all-male and an all-female pop group - [[One True Voice]] and [[Girls Aloud]] respectively - and made them compete for the Christmas number-one spot. Girls Aloud, a band that still achieves huge success in the [[UK]] today, obtained the spot with their single "[[Sound of the Underground]]" and therefore ultimately won the contest. This has been further continued with ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'', also broadcast on ITV in the UK, in which the winner's single is released the week before Christmas in order to contend the number one spot. Many have criticised this and its proponents, such as Simon Cowell, for hijacking the charts and eliminating any element of surprise in awaiting for the number one single. Also, many of these songs do not revolve around Christmas at all. This is likely to continue into 2007, as a fourth series of ''The X Factor'' is currently in production, due to end around Christmas 2007.
