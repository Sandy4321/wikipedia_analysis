Of the rest of the land, 21.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.8%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).<ref name=SFSO/>

Cham is located on the northern shore of [[Lake Zug]], {{km to mi|5.5|abbr=on}} to the north-west of the cantonal capital of [[Zug]].  Surrounding Cham, [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] is the east, [[H<U+00FC>nenberg]] is to the west, Lake Zug is south, and [[Knonau]] in the [[Canton of Z<U+00FC>rich]] is to the north.

The town is located at the mouth of the Lorze river, with two sections (Kirchb<U+00FC>hl and St<U+00E4>dtli) located on both sides of the river.  Cham also includes a number of smaller villages; Enikon, Lindencham, Friesencham, Hagendorn, Rumentikon, Niederwil, Oberwil and Bibersee.

==History==
[[File:Zugersee Cham.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Zug, near Cham]]
The shores of Lake Zug were populated at least 6000 years ago with several sites in Cham<ref name="HDS"/>.  A number of finds in the Oberwil village of Cham show that there were a number of middle and late [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] settlements in Cham.  In 1944-45 a large, unique Roman [[watermill]] with multiple [[waterwheel]]s was found in Hagendorn village.  A Roman warehouse from the same era has been discovered in Heiligkreuz village.

The city's name, Cham, translates as village and refers to a large [[Celts|Celtic]] settlement on the shore of Lake Zug.  Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, there was also an [[Alamanni]]c settlement, but only placenames remain.  The first mention of the town (as ''Chama'') occurred on April 16, 858 when King [[Louis the German]] gave the town to his daughter, Hildegard, the abbess of the [[Fraum<U+00FC>nster]] Abbey in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]]<ref name="HDS"/>.  The town was administered by a variety of nobles and bailiffs over the following centuries.  

In 1360 the town was granted a [[charter]] as well as the rights to hold a market and enroll citizens<ref name="HDS"/>.  This charter, granted by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], was given to Gottfried von H<U+00FC>nenberg as the ruler of the city.  The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], attempting to maintain their influence in the region following the loss of Zug to the Swiss Confederation in 1364, bought part of the town in 1366 and completely bought the H<U+00FC>nenberg family out in 1370.  However, following the decisive Habsburg defeat in the [[Battle of Sempach]] in 1386, Cham was taken by Zug and Schwyz.  The Habsburgs had pawned the town to a citizen of Z<U+00FC>rich, G<U+00F6>tz M<U+00FC>lner, and so Zug was not able to completely own the city until the loan was repaid in 1415<ref name="HDS"/>.  The city would remain under the control of the [[vogt]] or bailiff of Zug until the [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|French invasion]] of 1798.

In the 16<sup>th</sup> Century the reform-minded preacher Jost M<U+00FC>ller unsuccessfully attempted to bring the [[Swiss Reformation|Reformation]] to Cham. 

Following the 1798 invasion of Switzerland the collapse of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], Cham finally became an independent town.  Though the citizens still paid some taxes and tithes to Zug until 1816 when most were abolished and 1872 when the last one ended. 

The rapid industralization of the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century caused a population boom in Cham and the surrounding villages.  The population doubled between 1850 and 1880 and continued to grow at a slightly slower rate afterward.  The first urban plan and construction ordinances came into being in 1950.  A goal of the planning was to maintain the character of the industrial part of the city, becomes a center for the surrounding villages and preserve the parkland along the lake.  In 1991 the town was awarded the [[Wakker Prize]] for the preservation of its architectural heritage.  By 1990 Cham was the third largest city in the Canton of Zug.

For most of Cham's history, farming and light industry were the main sources of income.  The Lorze River has always been a key for the development of the city.  The first recorded watermill in Cham was built in 1279.  About 1641 a [[dyeing]] and bleaching operation was built along the river.  In 1657 a paper mill was built, which partly mechanized in the 1720s and had the first paper machine in 1840.  Following several mergers and expansions, this factory became the first Swiss [[wood pulp]] factory.  In the 20<sup>th</sup> Century it became ''Papierfabrik Cham AG'' the largest company in Cham.  

In 1863 a [[cotton]] spinning and weaving company opened in Cham.  Following a major fire in 1888 the factory closed, but the [[Dormitory|dormitories]] for child laborers for the factory are now a children's home.

In 1864 Cham was connected to the Z<U+00FC>rich-Lucerne train line.  In 1866 the American Page family founded the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co. in Cham to take advantage of this new rail line.  The company initially produced only condensed milk, but soon grew to produce other milk products.  In 1905 it merged with the [[Farine Lact<U+00E9>e Henri Nestl<U+00E9> Company]] to form [[Nestl<U+00E9>]].  The company expanded rapidly and by 1907 they had over 1000 [[milkmen]] in 44 locations.  In 1913 a conflict over money between the factory and the milkmen led to a strike and weakened the company.  Following World War I, the company faced financial crisis and began to shut down production in Cham.

In 1905 one-third of the population worked in agriculture, while half worked in industry.  By 1955 nearly two-thirds of the population worked in industry.  In the following year industrial jobs decreased while the central location and low taxes encouraged a growth in service industries.  In 2001 80% of the businesses and 58% of the jobs are in service industries, while 40% are in manufacturing<ref name="HDS"/>.
