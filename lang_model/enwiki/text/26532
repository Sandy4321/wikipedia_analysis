'''School head lice policy''' is a set of rules and guidelines designed to minimize [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] and [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[head-louse infestation]] in [[school]] settings.  Similar [[policies]] are implemented at [[summer camps]], [[day care]] facilities, and other locations where large numbers of children come into close contact.  The most well-known aspect of school head lice policy is the "no-nit policy".  This policy bars children from attendance if they are found to have [[Head_louse#Nits|nits]] in their hair -- a [[Medical sign|sign]] of [[head-louse infestation]] ([[pediculosis]]).<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006">{{cite journal

School head lice policy involves a number of issues:
*Circumstances under which children will be inspected
*Criteria to infer infestation
*Procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery
*Criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school (e.g., the no-nit policy)

These issues are controversial.  In particular, a number of health researchers and organizations object to the required removal of nits (i.e., the no-nit policy).<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/><ref name="Frankowski2002">{{cite journal

</ref> so minimizing [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] in this age group is potentially the most cost-effective way of controlling head lice [[epidemics]].

To this end, schools have implemented policies designed to identify, isolate, and treat students.  Unfortunately, this basic outline is complicated by a number of controversial issues.  As of 2008, no uniform school head lice policy is implemented worldwide, and researchers disagree as to the most appropriate policies.  Contributing to this controversy is a lack of data on fundamental questions concerning communicability of head lice in school settings, and the efficacy of particular school policies.

School head lice policies deal with a number of issues, most of which are controversial:
*Circumstances under which children will be inspected 
*Criteria to infer infestation 
*Procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery 
*Criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school (e.g., the "no-nit" policy)

For these reasons, routine screening of asymptomatic children is advocated by a variety of nurses, researchers, organizations, and governments.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/><ref name="CA2007"/><ref name="NPA"/><ref name="Clore1990">{{cite journal

===Screening prevalence and frequency===
[[Image:Headlice.jpg|thumb|right|Adult male (left) and female (right) head lice]]
Despite these recommendations, routine screening at schools is uncommon.  A 1991 survey of American nurses reported that only 27% have regular screening programs in place at their schools.<ref name="Donnelly1991"/>  This being despite the fact that 65% bar students with nits from returning to school.<ref name="Donnelly1991"/>  85% reported screening on an "as-needed" basis.<ref name="Donnelly1991"/><ref name="Hootman2002"/><!-- Hootman (2002) lists some of the reasons for screens that might be considered "as-needed".

The California Department of Public Health encourages screenings to be performed on Fridays.<ref name="CA2007"/>  This allows infested students to be treated over the weekend, potentially minimizing student absenteeism.

===Screening controversy===
Some health researchers oppose asymptomatic screening.<ref name="Frankowski2004"/><ref name="NASN2004"/>  This opposition to school screening coincides with opposition to no-nit policies, and is based on similar reasoning (i.e., that they are ineffective).<ref name="Frankowski2002"/>

==Criteria to infer infestation==
===What is a "nit"?===
{{wiktionary|nit}}
{{seealso|Nits (lice)}}
A nit is generally known as the egg of a louse.  However, with respect to the communicability of head lice, whether an egg contains a viable embryo or not is eminently relevant.  Extinct infestations may leave a host with hundreds of eggshells that are empty (or will never hatch) attached to the host's hair.  This holdover from prior infestation will remain until physically removed, but poses no risk of transmission or re-infestation.<ref name="Burgess1995"/>

[[Image:Head louse egg.jpg|thumb|right|The egg of a head louse still attached to a hair.  The head of a match is included for scale.]]

These difficulties have, at times, lead to the recommendation that the presence of nits alone be used to infer infestation:[[Image:Fig. 5. Louse nits.jpg|thumb|right|Head louse nits on human hair]]

But in terms of school policy, the general questions regarding nits-only students remain:
*Should these students be excluded?
*Should schools require these students be treated?

===Significance of nits===
A 1998 American study attempted to clarify the infestation risk associated with a "nits-only" diagnosis.  They found that 18% of children with nits (but no apparent lice) became infested (i.e., lice appeared) 14 days later.<ref name="Williams2001"/>  Whether these new lice came from viable eggs or via transmission from other hosts was not clear.<ref name="Williams2001"/>  Transmission from other hosts would tend to overestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  In addition, some children were treated with [[pediculicide]]s during this 14 day period.<ref name="Williams2001"/>  Successful treatments (i.e., killing eggs or recently-hatched nymphs) would tend to underestimate the infestation risk associated with nits.  These limitations of the study notwithstanding, the authors concluded:

{{quote|Most children with nits alone will not become infested; therefore, excluding these children from school and requiring them to be treated with a pediculicide is probably excessive.|L. Keoki Williams and others (2001)<ref name="Williams2001"/>}}

===Benefits of nit-free population===
Although "nits-only" children are unlikely to become infested, this is not to say that a nit-free population is without value.  Much of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing head lice stems from the possibility that observed nits are due to an extinct infestation.  However, if a policy of required nit removal is enforced, this is no longer an issue.  Against a background of nit-free children, spotting new infestations through routine screening becomes as easy as spotting the nits.<ref name="Brainerd1998">{{cite journal

</ref>  This ease in screening comes at a price, though, namely the effort expended (typically by parents) in removing nits.  And to the extent that no-nit policies result in absenteeism, the child's education suffers, and the school's funding (e.g., from government sources) may be reduced.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/><ref name="EdSource">{{Cite web

==Discovery of infested students==
===Immediate exclusion from school===
Discovery of infested students typically occurs during a school day.  Assuming the presence of live lice is the criteria used to infer infestation, an ethical dilemma is presented to school nurses and administrators.  Should this student, now known to be infectious, be returned to class where transmission to other students could occur?  Or alternatively, should the student be immediately removed from the group setting?  Schools have very limited capacity to individually supervise students outside of the classroom, so removal from the classroom means requesting that the child's parents pick up their child.

Parents often become upset when the school nurse telephones their place of employment to inform them of their child's infestation and to request they come and collect their child.<ref name="Clore1990"/>  Nonetheless, immediate exclusion policies are explicitly advocated by some nurses.<ref name="Clore1990"/>  A 1998 survey revealed that almost all (96%) American [[School nursing|school nurses]] send home infested students upon discovery.<ref name="Price1999">{{cite journal

Opponents to immediate exclusion policies point out that the discovery of infestation is merely recognition of what has been an infectious condition for a number of months.<ref name="Maunder1983"/><ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>  Given that context, they argue, one more day of group contact is unlikely to result in more transmission than has already occurred.<ref name="Maunder1983"/><ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>  This contrasts with more short-term and highly communicable [[virus|viral]] diseases such as [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]], or [[measles]] where immediate exclusion might reasonably reduce disease spread within the school.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

The value of immediate exclusion for lice depends to some extent on the frequency of asymptomatic screening at the school.  More frequent screening would tend to decrease the average time between infestation and discovery of that infestation.  This would make the one day associated with immediate exclusion a more significant fraction of the total time the student was infectious.  But even ardent supporters of asymptomatic screening do not advocate screenings more than once every three months.<ref name="Clore1990"/>  This suggests that the effect of immediate exclusion might be an exposure time reduction of as little as 1.6%, even under strict screening guidelines.<ref>Three months includes approximately 90 days, which in turn includes approximately 64 weekdays.  One out of 64 days is 0.0156 or 1.6%.</ref>

These changing attitudes on immediate exclusion appear to be affecting public policy.  For example, in Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that infested children need not be sent home upon discovery.<ref name="Australia2005"/>  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a head lice policy that does not immediately exclude infested children.<ref name="CA2007">{{cite web

===Communicability in school settings===
Evaluating immediate exclusion policies is difficult, because {{as of|2008|lc=on}} the communicability of head lice in school settings has not been carefully studied.<ref name="Hootman2002"/>  This has not, however, prevented authors from confidently asserting their opinion:

{{quote|In some areas... crowded conditions at home may predispose persons to head lice.  Nevertheless, evidence indicates that most transmission actually occurs at school.|Norman G. Gratz, 1997<ref name="Gratz1997"/>}}

   | volume = 38
   | pages = 285-290
   | publisher = International Society of Dermatology}}
</ref>  However, the authors differ in their interpretation of this clustering.  In 1997, Richard Speare and Petra Buettner noted prevalence ranges of 0% to 72.2% across classrooms in the same grade (3rd) and in the same Australian school.  This led them to favored the idea that "opportunities for transmission are prominent within the classroom".<ref name="Speare1999"/>  Indeed, their data suggest that classrooms synchronize in terms of infestation status.

In contrast, Janis Hootman suggests that school communicability is low.<ref name="Hootman2002"/>  In 1998 she found that infestations within American classrooms were restricted to a minority of chronically-infested students.  Hootman concluded that the infested students have access to an infectious source that their classmates do not.  Similarly, she found that clusters of pediculosis within classrooms were associated social interactions outside school (e.g., [[sleepover]]s).<ref name="Hootman2002"/>  This indicates that transmission can occur between classmates, but again, these transmission events may be occurring away from school grounds.

==Barring return to school==
[[Image:<U+00C9>pouillage2.jpg|thumb|Detail of a woman picking lice from a child's head.  From ''Cour de ferme'' (1662) by [[Jan Siberechts]]]]
After identifying and isolating an infested student, school policy typically requires some sort of verification that the student is no longer infectious before being readmitted to the school.  Typically, this involves inspecting the child for evidence of continued infestation (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  Schools commonly enforce either a "no-nit" policy or a "no-lice" policy.

===The no-nit policy===
No-nit policies bar readmission of students found to have lice, eggs, or nits.  This policy is popular with health authorities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]].<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>  A 1998 survey revealed that a majority (61%) of American [[School nursing|school nurses]] prevent return of treated students to school if they are not (also) nit-free.<ref name="Price1999"/><ref name="Donnelly1991"/>  A similar percentage (60%) felt that "forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea."<ref name="Price1999"/>  Data from a primarily American study during 1998-1999 revealed even higher prevalence -- no-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation.<ref name="Pollack2000">{{cite journal

</ref>

James H. Price and colleagues estimate that infested students lose two to four days of school for treatment and nit removal.<ref name="Price1999"/>  Based on their 1998 survey of American school nurses, they estimate that approximately 6 million U.S. children lose 12 to 24 million child-schooldays annually due to lice infestation under no-nit policies.<ref name="Price1999"/>

====Controversy surrounding no-nit policy====
{{Rquote|right|The no-nit policies may appeal to laypersons, and it is difficult to explain why they are not effective, particularly when some consumer organizations strongly support them.  Nevertheless, there is no scientific basis to confirm the effectiveness of such programs...|Barbara L. Frankowski (2004)<ref name="Frankowski2004"/>}}

Although the no-nit policy has the appearance of a simple and popular tool against pediculosis transmission, its implementation has been opposed by a number of health researchers and organizations.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/><ref name="Frankowski2002"/><ref name="Frankowski2004"/><ref name="NASN2004"/>  Opponents argue that enforcement of no-nit policies has not significantly reduced head lice incidence in school settings,<ref name="Frankowski2002"/> and that the risks and disadvantages of the no-nit policies outweigh their associated benefits.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>

As is the case in assessing school screening efforts (see [[School head lice policy#Screening|Screening]] above), assessing the effectiveness of no-nit policies is complicated by the sparseness of head lice prevalence data.<ref name="Donnelly1991"/><ref name="Billstein1979"/>  To the extent that no-nit policies increase the efficiency of school screening programs (see [[School head lice policy#Benefits of nit-free population|Benefits of nit-free population]] above), no-nit policies may lead to more rapid containment of head lice outbreaks.  However, {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, the [[correlation]] between no-nit policies and head lice [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] has not been examined.

====Inherent conflict over no-nit policy====
Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and colleagues indict required nit removal policies as an attempt to minimize the effort expended by school nurses on differentiating active and extinct infestations.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>  They further argue that this minimization comes at the expense of excessive efforts on the part of parents to remove signs of previous infestations (i.e., the nits), which have no clinical importance.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>

The difficulty parents face in advocating more lax attitudes towards children with nits, is that the parents have no concomitant guarantee from school administrators that those admitted children will truly be lice-free.  Indeed, admitting children with nits ''increases'' the difficulty in identifying actively infested students (see [[School head lice policy#Criteria to infer infestation|Criteria to infer infestation]] above).  In contrast to diseases such as [[measles]] or [[influenza]], pediculosis does not inherently prevent school attendance.  The financial incentive for schools, therefore, is to minimize expenditures on lice control and screening programs because (absent a no-nit policy) they have little effect on attendance.<ref name="Sciscione2007"/>  This is a formula for maximizing lice infestation within the student body, not minimizing it.  Thus, while the no-nit policy may be seen as off-loading school nurse responsibilities to parents,<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/> it is perhaps more correctly viewed as imposing parental priorities on school administrators.

In the absence of such policies, school and parental priorities with respect to lice are inherently at odds.  The parents wish to minimize lice transmission. In contrast, schools wish to maximize attendance, which is largely unaffected by lice transmission.  Barring return of children until nits are removed has the effect of transforming the pediculosis "problem" for which schools have no inherent incentive to solve, into an attendance "problem" for which schools have a direct financial interest.  Unfortunately, the solution advocated by many to this attendance "problem" is to simply remove the no-nit policy,<ref name="Frankowski2002"/> leaving the inherent conflict between parents and school administrators unaddressed.

===The no-lice policy===
The no-lice policy bars readmission of students with crawling lice, but are indifferent to the presence of eggs and nits.  These policies are advocated by a number of government agencies, but {{as of|2008|lc=on}}, no data on the overall prevalence of no-lice policies exists.  In Australia, the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] states that treated children can return with nits so long as they are lice-free.<ref name="Australia2005"/>  Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a policy that permits students to return to school with nits.<ref name="CA2007"/>
