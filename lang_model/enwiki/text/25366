'''Andrew Dessler''' PhD is a [[professor]] at [[Texas A&M University]] in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.  He has produced theories of the role of water vapor<ref>Sherwood, S.C., and A.E. Dessler. 2000. On the control of stratospheric humidity. [[Geophysical Research Letters]] 27:2513-2516]</ref> which provide a scientific counter-argument to conventional [[global warming]] theory; his research subject areas are climate systems research and [[climate change]] policy.  He has a BA degree from [[Rice University]] and a PhD degree from [[Harvard University]]. 

Dessler spent the year 2000 as a senior policy analyst in the [[White House]] [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]]. While there, he became aware of that policymakers and the general public often lack an understanding of how science works and how to interpret the conflicting claims in policy debates. Dessler<U+2019>s focus is on understanding the Earth<U+2019>s climate; he has also produced original research on [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[chemistry]].   

He has served as an Associate Editor for the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'', and editor for the [[American Geophysical Union]].  As further evidence of his standing among scientific peers, Dessler was selected as [[keynote speaker]] at a technical conference of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/electricpower-sf6/pdf/nov06/Final_SpeakerBios.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Fourth International Conference on Sulfur Hexafluoride and the Environment]</ref>

==Principal policy work==
Dessler's principal policy [[monograph]], ''The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change: a Guide to the Debate'',  conveys the complexity of the current global climate change.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521539412&ss=exc Andrew E. Dessler and Edward A. Parson, ''The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change: a Guide to the Debate'' ISBN-13: 9780521539418]</ref>  His work gives competing views a balanced treatment and uses scientific reasoning to test the merits of alternative theories of the status of global warming and climate change.  His book details the significance of earth surface [[temperature]] change versus [[troposphere]] change.  In addition he provides insights to the [[geological]] time scale of global warming. 

[[Danny Yee]] characterises the Dessler work as solid and emphasizes the balance and scientific basis of Dessler's work; Yee says that "every general library should have a copy".<ref>[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Global_Climate_Change.html Danny Lee review of ''The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change: a Guide to the Debate'']</ref>

==Research==
The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) featured<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/missions/earth/f_vapor.html Will Runaway Water Warm the World?]</ref> research by Dessler and Minchwaner questioning the degree of global warming, given the pair's discovery of a new theory of the trend in planetary atmospheric water vapor using NASA's [[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]]. The [[University of Maryland]]<ref>[http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/facts/mm/03_04/mar.cfm Satellite Finds Warming 'Relative' to Humidity
]</ref> noted the same study that the role of [[water vapor]] trends provide a tangible scientific premise that [[global warming]] may be overestimated.<ref>[http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/002002.html Randall Parker, March 18, 2004,
