The '''1995 Pacific Grand Prix''' (formally the '''II Pacific Grand Prix''') was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on October 22, 1995 at the [[Okayama International Circuit|TI Circuit]], [[Aida, Okayama|Aida]], [[Japan]]. It was the 15th race of the [[1995 Formula One season]].<ref name=pg214-215/> The race, contested over 83&nbsp;laps, was won by [[Michael Schumacher]] for the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team after starting from third position. [[David Coulthard]], who started the Grand Prix from [[pole position]], finished second in a [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] car, with [[Damon Hill]] third in the other Williams.<ref name=formula1.com-officialresult>{{cite web | url = http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1995/128/ | publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website |title = 1995 Pacific Grand Prix | accessdate = 2008-04-25}}</ref> Schumacher's win confirmed him as [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|1995 Drivers' Champion]] as Hill could not pass Schumacher's points total with only two races remaining.<ref name=gp-schumi>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00331.html | title = Schumacher is World Champion | date = [[1995-10-23]] | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1}}</ref>

=== Background ===
The race, originally scheduled to be held as the third round of the [[1995 Formula One season|season]] on April 16, 1995, was moved to October as the local infrastructure and communications were badly damaged from the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]].<ref name=grandprix-009>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00009.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = Formula 1 calendar rethink | date = 1995-02-06 | accessdate = 2008-04-26}}</ref><ref name=sundaytimes>{{cite journal | last = Roebuck | first = Nigel | authorlink = Nigel Roebuck | date = [[1995-10-22]] | title = Schumacher prepares countdown to title - Motor Racing | journal = [[The Sunday Times]] | pages = p. 2/19 | publisher = [[Times Newspapers]] | location = [[London]], [[England]] <!-- | url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=UKNB&p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200F929F41E7EBE692%20)&p_docid=0F929F41E7EBE692&p_theme=aggregated5&p_queryname=0F929F41E7EBE692&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=M58A5COSMTIyMDYzMzA5MC45ODc1MTI6MTo4OnJmLTE5MDcy&&p_multi=LSTB | accessdate = 2008-09-04-->}}</ref>

Heading into the 15th race of the season, [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] was leading the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 82&nbsp;points; [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] driver [[Damon Hill]] was second on 55&nbsp;points, 27&nbsp;points behind Schumacher. A maximum of 30&nbsp;points were available for the remaining three races, which meant that Hill could still win the title. Schumacher only needed a fourth place finish to become Drivers' Champion as, even if Hill won, Schumacher would be more than 20&nbsp;points ahead of Hill with two races remaining. Behind Hill and Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship, [[David Coulthard]] was third on 43&nbsp;points in a Williams, with [[Johnny Herbert]] and [[Jean Alesi]] both on 40&nbsp;points.<ref name=grandprix-322>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00322.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = Champion in all but name | date = 1995-10-16 | accessdate = 2008-04-26}}</ref> In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] were leading on 112&nbsp;points and [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] were second on 92&nbsp;points, with a maximum of 48&nbsp;points available.<ref name=pg214-215/><ref name=grandprix-322/> In the two weeks leading up to the race, there was heavy criticism towards Damon Hill, with pundits feeling that Hill had not been "forceful" enough in his battle at the [[1995 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] against Schumacher.<ref name=walker-hill/><ref name=pg209/> In an interview leading up to the race, part-time [[Ligier]] driver [[Martin Brundle]] said:

[[Image:Damon Hill juillet 1995.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Damon Hill]], who was criticised by pundits leading into the race]]
Schumacher, his title-rival, said that Hill made "half-hearted attempts" to overtake, which led to him "getting into trouble".<ref name=pg209/> The comments were prompted after a series of battles between Hill and Schumacher in previous race meetings, most notably at the [[1995 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], where Hill accused Schumacher of blocking him.<ref name=grandprix-belgium>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr575.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = Grand Prix Results: Belgium GP, 1995 | accessdate = 2007-03-20}}</ref> At a [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) [[FIA World Motor Sport Council|World Motor Sport Council]] meeting on October 19 to discuss driver etiquette, they opted against introducing new rules on the issue.

Williams were favourites to win the race due to the nature of the track<U+2014>their [[Williams FW17]] car was more suited to [[downforce|high-downforce]] tracks like Aida, and thus had the advantage over Benetton. In an attempt to match the pace of the Williams cars, Benetton introduced a revised [[rear suspension]] geometry to the [[Benetton B195]] for the race.<ref name=pg209>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Henry | title = [[Autocourse]] 1995-96 | origyear = 1995 | origmonth = December | publisher = Hazelton Publishing | isbn = 1-8745-5736-5 | pages = p. 209}}</ref>

There were five driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Ligier cars since the tenth&nbsp;race of the season at [[1995 German Grand Prix|Germany]], Martin Brundle was replaced by [[Aguri Suzuki]] as part of the two sharing the drive for the season.<ref name=times-oct20/><ref name=grandprix-r>{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Saward | authorlink = Joe Saward | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00204.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = News Feature - 1995 Formula 1 Review | date = 1995-12-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> [[Jan Magnussen]] was drafted into the [[McLaren]] team to replace [[Mika H<U+00E4>kkinen]] because of the Finn's operation for [[appendicitis]].<ref name=grandprix-hakkinenappendicitis>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00336.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = Magnussen impresses for McLaren | date = 1995-10-23 | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> The third driver change was [[Ukyo Katayama]]'s return to [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] after missing the European Grand Prix due to a crash at the [[1995 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]].<ref name=grandprix-katayama>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00310.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | title = Tyrrell drive up for grabs | date = 1995-10-02 | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> [[Gianni Morbidelli]] returned to the [[Footwork Arrows|Footwork]] team replacing [[Max Papis]], while at [[Pacific Racing|Pacific]], [[Bertrand Gachot]] came back to replace [[Jean-Denis D<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>traz]], both men having driven for these teams at the start of the season.<ref name=pg232>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Henry | title = [[Autocourse]] 1995-96 | origyear = 1995 | origmonth = December | publisher = Hazelton Publishing | isbn = 1-8745-5736-5 | pages = p. 232}}</ref>

=== Practice and qualifying ===
{{quote box|quote="For me it was just a case of going out for my last run and trying to do better just in case Michael improved.

Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1&nbsp;hour and 45&nbsp;minutes with weather conditions dry throughout.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.galeforcef1.com/f1/95/pacific/ | title = Pacific Grand Prix - 95 | publisher = Gale Force F1 | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:16.057, three-tenths of a second quicker than Hill and Coulthard, in second and third places respectively. The [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] cars were fourth and fifth fastest; [[Gerhard Berger]] ahead of [[Jean Alesi]], with McLaren driver [[Mark Blundell]] rounding out the top six.<ref name=pg214-215/> Coulthard lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1:15.730. Hill was second in the Williams, three-tenths of a second behind Coulthard. [[Eddie Irvine]] in the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] car was fourth, seven-tenths behind Coulthard. He was split by the Ferraris who were third and fifth; Alesi in front of Berger. The Benetton cars were sixth and seventh; Schumacher in front of Herbert. [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] and [[Jean-Christophe Boullion]] were eighth and tenth in the [[Sauber]]s, with [[Rubens Barrichello]] ninth in the Jordan, two&nbsp;seconds off the pace.<ref name=pg214-215/>

Coulthard clinched his fourth consecutive [[pole position]], in his Williams, with a time of 1:14.013.<ref name=pg214-215/><ref name=formula1.com-coulthard1995>{{cite web | url = http://www.formula1.com/results/driver/1995/11.html | publisher = The Official Formula 1 Website | title = 1995 > Coulthard, David | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}</ref> He was joined on the front row by team-mate Hill, who was two-tenths of a second behind.<ref name=pg214-215/> Schumacher was third in the Benetton, edging closer to the Williams drivers throughout both days of qualifying by steadily reducing the [[downforce]] on his car.  His last run, right at the end of the second session on Saturday afternoon, pressured Coulthard into leaving the pits to cover the German. The pole position man thus used an additional set of [[slick tyres]], meaning that out of the allocation of seven-sets of slick tyres as set out by the FIA, he had only two sets of brand-new rubber for the race, whereas Schumacher had the advantage of three sets of new rubber. Hill, concerned about starting from the dirty side of the track (the side of the track that is opposite to the [[racing line]]), had only two sets of brand new tyres for the race.<ref name=pg209/>

The conditions for the race were dry with the [[air temperature]] {{convert|21|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}.<ref name=pg214-215/> The drivers took to the track at 09:30&nbsp;[[Japan Standard Time|JST]] ([[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] +8) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest on a time of 1:16.831.

[[Olivier Panis]] completed the top four in a [[Ligier]] car, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill.<ref name=pg214-215/> Hill drove the spare Williams car along the inside of the start-finish straight in an effort to clean up his grid position on the dusty side of the track.<ref name="pg209"/> Schumacher finished the session in eighth, despite going off the track, damaging his race car in the process.<ref name=bbc>{{cite video | people = [[Murray Walker|Walker, Murray]] (Commentator) | date2 = 1995-10-29 | title = Grand Prix | medium = Television production | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = [[London]], [[England]] | time = 13:30<U+2013>14:00 | accessdate = 2008-08-17 | quote = And this morning, Michael Schumacher went off the track and damaged his race car tore off the barge board part of the aerodynamics on the left side of the car.}}</ref>

Alesi, Hill and Schumacher all pitted for their first of three&nbsp;stops on lap&nbsp;18. The Benetton [[Pit stop#List of Formula One Pit Crew|pitcrew]] made a quick stop for Schumacher, allowing him to get out ahead of Alesi and Hill.<ref name=pg209/> Hill lost additional time with a sticking refuelling valve, causing his stop to last almost twice as long as Schumacher's.<ref name="pg211"/> Schumacher exited the pit stop in fourth place (behind Coulthard, and the yet-to-stop Berger and Herbert), with Alesi in seventh place (split from Schumacher by Irvine) and Hill in tenth place (separated from Alesi by Frentzen and Blundell).<ref name="pg214-215"/> With Alesi and Hill held up by the slower runners on two-stop strategies in front, Schumacher pulled away and closed in on Coulthard.

After the race, it was revealed that Schumacher endured a [[Transmission (mechanics)|downshift]] problem after his final stop, and that he was lucky to complete the final&nbsp;lap as warning lights had activated on his steering wheel.<ref name=grandprix-pacific/> Schumacher praised his pitcrew for doing a "perfect" first&nbsp;stop which helped him move in front of Alesi and Hill. He said he "never saw anything like this team and its ability to come up with strategies" and that they never made "one mistake this season".<ref name=pg211/> Off-camera while going through [[parc ferm<U+00E9>]], Schumacher and Hill renewed their argument from the [[1995 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]] over what degree of blocking was acceptable after their first corner incident.<ref name=grandprix-pacific/> Schumacher told Hill that he was unhappy with Hill's driving throughout the race, most notably during Schumacher's overtaking attempts on lap&nbsp;one and lap&nbsp;eleven where Schumacher felt Hill had "brake tested" him.<ref name=times-oct23-1/> Hill refuted Schumacher's claims, saying:

{{quote|Michael wasn't happy with what I did a couple of times in the race and he has told me that he is unhappy with my driving. I find that extraordinary. The situation now is that we are completely free to drive as we like as long as it is not deliberately dangerous, So I drove in that style and he didn't like it. He should have no complaints&nbsp;... somehow or other, when we got into the braking area at the end of the back straight I did something wrong. But I can't see what I did wrong. It seems that there is one rule for him and another for everybody else at times. I just think that either you agree to that, and there should be no complaints, or there are rules and you should stick to them. I think that I am a better, stronger driver this year than I was last year and can build on that for next year. Clearly Michael has an advantage over everyone and if I want to win, then I am going to have to overhaul him.<ref name=pg211/>}}

Despite Hill's comments, he endured continued criticism by the British media after the poor performance; speculation brewed that Williams were going to replace him with Frentzen for the 1996 season.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hill | first = Damon | authorlink = Damon Hill | title = [[Damon Hill]]: My Championship Year | origyear = 1996 | origmonth = November | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | isbn = 1-8745-5736-5 | pages = p. 163<U+2013>168}}</ref> Despite the rumours, Williams team boss [[Frank Williams]] gave Hill "an unequivocal vote of confidence" heading into the next race, the [[1995 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]].<ref name=pg218>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Henry | title = [[Autocourse]] 1995-96 | origyear = 1995 | origmonth = December | publisher = Hazelton Publishing | isbn = 1-8745-5736-5 | pages = p. 218}}</ref> Schumacher subsequently changed his opinion of the incident after watching video footage prior to the Japanese race and no longer blamed Hill for it.<ref name=pg218/>

During an interview Coulthard, who finished second, revealed that it was his decision to change to a two-stop strategy from a three-stop strategy, telling the Williams pitcrew to delay his stop. Afterwards, he said that in hindsight he would have stayed on a three-stop strategy, and wished he could "blame someone else for this decision, but I can't".<ref name=pg211/> The 1995 race was the last held at the Aida circuit, and the last Formula One race to date held under the Pacific Grand Prix banner, with the manager of the [[Okayama International Circuit|TI Circuit]] unable to keep the venue financially profitable.<ref name=sundaytimes/><ref name=1996calendar>{{cite web | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00324.html | date = 1995-10-16 | accessdate = 2008-08-26 | title = Finally a 1996 Formula 1 calendar! | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1}}</ref>
