The '''Battle of the Ice''' ({{lang-ru|<U+041B><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0431><U+043E><U+0438><U+0449><U+0435>, ''Ledovoye poboish'ye''}}; {{lang-de|Schlacht auf dem Eise}}; {{lang-et|J<U+00E4><U+00E4>lahing}}; {{lang-lv|Ledus kauja}}), also known as the '''Battle of Lake Peipus''' ({{lang-de|Schlacht auf dem Peipussee}}), was a [[battle]] between the [[Novgorod Republic|Republic of Novgorod]] and the [[Livonian Order|Livonian branch]] of the [[Teutonic Knights]] on [[April 5]], [[1242]], at [[Lake Peipus]].

The battle was a significant defeat sustained by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] crusaders during the [[Northern Crusades]], which were directed against [[paganism|pagans]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] rather than [[Muslim]]s in the [[Holy Land]]. The crusaders' defeat in the battle ended campaigns against the Orthodox [[Novgorod Republic]] and other [[Russia]]n territories for the next century.

== Background ==

Hoping to exploit the Russians' weakness in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol]] and [[Battle of the Neva|Swedish]] invasions, the [[Teutonic Knights]] attacked the neighboring [[Novgorod Republic]] and occupied [[Pskov]], [[Izborsk]], and [[Koporye]] in the autumn of 1240. When they approached Novgorod itself, the local citizens recalled to the city 20-year-old Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]], whom they had banished to [[Pereslavl-Zalessky|Pereslavl]] earlier that year. During the campaign of 1241, Alexander managed to retake Pskov and Koporye from the crusaders.

== The battle ==

In the spring of 1242, the [[Teutonic Knights]] defeated a detachment of Novgorodians about 20&nbsp;km south of the fortress of Dorpat ([[Tartu]]). Led by [[Prince-Bishop]] [[Hermann of Dorpat]], the knights and their auxiliary troops of local [[Ugaunians|Ugaunian]] Estonians then met with Alexander's forces by the narrow strait that connects the northern and southern parts of Lake Peipus (Lake Peipus proper with Lake Pskovskoe) on [[April 5]], [[1242]]. Alexander, intending to fight in a place of his own choosing, retreated in efforts to draw the often over-confident Crusaders to the frozen lake. 

The crusader forces likely numbered somewhere in the area of 500 to 1000 {{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Most of them were probably Chud (Estonian) levies. The Russian force in contrast numbered around 5,000 soldiers: Alexander and his brother [[Andrei II of Vladimir|Andrei]]'s bodyguards (''[[druzhina]]''), who numbered around 1,000, plus the militia of Novgorod.

According to contemporary Russian chronicles, after hours of hand-to-hand fighting, Alexander ordered the left and right wings of his [[Archery|archers]] to enter the battle. The knights by this time were exhausted from the constant fighting and struggling with the slippery surface of the frozen lake. The Crusaders started to retreat in disarray deeper onto the ice, and the appearance of the fresh Russian [[cavalry]] made them run for their lives. When the knights attempted to rally themselves at the far side of the lake the thin ice started to collapse, under the weight of their heavy armour, and many knights drowned.

==Casualties==

According to the [[First Novgorod Chronicle]],
<blockquote>Prince Alexander and all the men of Novgorod drew up their forces by the lake, at Uzmen, by the Raven's Rock; and the Germans and the Estonians rode at them, driving themselves like a wedge throughout their army. And there was a great slaughter of Germans and Estonians... they fought with them during the pursuit on the ice seven [[verst]]s short of the Subol [north-western] shore. And there fell a countless number of Estonians, and 400 of the Germans, and they took fifty with their hands and they took them to Novgorod.<ref name="Christiansen">Christiansen, Eric.

According to the [[Livonian Order]]'s ''[[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]]'', written years later,
<blockquote>The [Russians] had many archers, and the battle began with their bold assault on the king's men [Danes]. The brothers' banners were soon flying in the midst of the archers, and swords were heard cutting helmets apart. Many from both sides fell dead on the grass. Then the Brothers' army was completely surrounded, for the Russians had so many troops that there were easily sixty men for every one German knight. The Brothers fought well enough, but they were nonetheless cut down. Some of those from Dorpat escaped from the battle, and it was their salvation that they fled. Twenty brothers lay dead and six were captured.<ref name="Urban">Urban, William. ''The Teutonic Knights: A Military History''. Greenhill Books. London, 2003. ISBN 1-85367-535-0 </ref></blockquote>

The Battle of the Ice has been described as an event of major significance, especially by Russian historians. The knights' defeat at the hands of Alexander's forces prevented the crusaders from retaking Pskov, the linchpin of their eastern crusade. The Novgorodians succeeded in defending Russian territory, and the German crusaders never mounted another serious challenge eastward. Alexander was canonised as a saint in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1574.  

More recently, historian John I. L. Fennell has written a controversial book, calling into question the glorification of the battle, arguing that it was not as important nor as large as has sometimes been portrayed. Fennell  claimed that most of the Teutonic Knights were by that time engaged elsewhere in the Baltic, and the aforementioned Livonian Rhymed Chronicle gives the figure of only 20 knights killed, which Fennell argued was "hardly indicative of a major encounter even if we take into consideration epic minimalization of the home-team's side."<ref>John Fennell, ''The Crisis of Medieval Russia 1200-1304'', (London: Longman, 1983), 106.</ref>
 
Fennell's approach has been widely criticized among Russian historians. It has been pointed out that Fennell distorted the picture by ignoring many historical facts and sources, while his modelling of the past events was to some extent in line with the tradition of discrediting the Russian and then Soviet history by the Western historians. <ref>http://www.pravoslavie.ru/archiv/mezhdvukhzol.htm <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440> <U+0423><U+0436><U+0430><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>. <U+041C><U+0435><U+0436> <U+0434><U+0432><U+0443><U+0445> <U+0437><U+043E><U+043B>. <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0432><U+044B><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430> <U+041D><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> (Alexander Uzhankov. Between two evils. The historical choice of Alexander Nevsky)</ref>

Fennell also made an attempt to put more stress on Alexander Nevsky's (and his father's) policy of enforced cooperation with the Mongols (or Tatars as they are known in Russia), which the author calls 'accommodation or collaboration', while trying to neglect the significance of Nevsky's victories on Neva and on Lake Peipus. In Fennell's view, the 'negative' impact of Nevsky's cooperation with the overpowering Mongols did bring much more harm to Russia than successful protection of Russian north-western borders against the Roman Catholic knights.<ref>Fennell, ''The Crisis of Medieval Russia'', 97-124, esp. 103-106.</ref> Such controversial point has also been widely criticized in Russian press, bringing more attention to the methods used by the Western historians in the field of Russian history studies. <ref>http://www.pravoslavie.ru/archiv/mezhdvukhzol.htm <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440> <U+0423><U+0436><U+0430><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>. <U+041C><U+0435><U+0436> <U+0434><U+0432><U+0443><U+0445> <U+0437><U+043E><U+043B>. <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0432><U+044B><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430> <U+041D><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> (Alexander Uzhankov. Between two evils. The historical choice of Alexander Nevsky)</ref>

== Popular culture ==

The event was glorified in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s historical drama film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]''. The movie, bearing [[propaganda film|propagandist]] [[allegory|allegories]] of the Teutonic Knights as [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]], has created a popular image of the battle often mistaken for the real events. [[Sergei Prokofiev]] turned his score for the film into a concert cantata of the same title, the longest movement of which is "The Battle on the Ice."

During [[World War II]], the image of Alexander Nevsky became a national Russian symbol of fighting against German occupation. Today, there exists in Russia an [[Order of St. Alexander Nevsky|Order of Holy Alexander Nevsky]], a medal given for outstanding bravery and excellent service to the country.

Heavy metal band [[Aria (band)|Aria]] composed a song, "Ballad of the Russian Warrior", for their ''[[Geroy Asfalta|Hero of Asphalt]]'' album in 1987. The song describes the battle from a participant's point of view.
