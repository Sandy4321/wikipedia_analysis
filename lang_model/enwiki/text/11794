'''USS ''Weeden'' (DE-797)''' was a {{sclass|Buckley|destroyer escort}} in the [[United States Navy]].  She was named for Ensign [[Carl A. Weeden]] (1916<U+2013>1941), who was killed during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

''Weeden'' was laid down on 18 August 1943 at [[Orange, Texas]], by the [[Consolidated Steel Corporation]]; launched on 27 October 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Alice N. Weeden; and commissioned on 19 February 1944, with [[Lieutenant Commander]] C.&nbsp;F. Tillinghast, Jr., in command. 

==Service history==
===World War II, 1944&ndash;1945===
After a fitting-out period complicated by the necessity for repairs to her power plant, the destroyer escort departed [[Galveston, Texas]], on 30 March for her [[shakedown cruise]].  Arriving at [[Bermuda]] on 5 April, she spent the rest of the month in training exercises; she left Bermuda on 1 May, and arrived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on the 6th.  She completed voyage repairs on the 14th and moved to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], where she served for a month as target ship for the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] [[Torpedo Squadron Training School]].  Near the end of June, she reported for duty in [[Escort Division 56]].

On 4 July, she departed Boston in the screen of a [[convoy]] bound for [[Bizerte, Tunisia]].  The entire round-trip voyage, during which she escorted convoys in both directions, occupied her time until 18 August when she re-entered Boston.  After training exercises at [[Casco Bay, Maine]], she rendezvoused with another Bizerte-bound convoy near [[Norfolk, Virginia]], in mid-September.  About half way across the ocean, CortDiv 56 received orders to part company with the convoy and head for [[Plymouth, England]], where they picked up a convoy of [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]'s bound for the United States.  Arriving home on 25 October, she again completed voyage repairs and conducted [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) exercises at Casco Bay.  On 17 November, she joined another trans-atlantic convoy at Norfolk.  That voyage took her via [[Gibraltar]] to [[Oran, Algeria]], thence back to the United States at Boston where she arrived at the end of the last week in December.  She completed repairs in the [[Charlestown Navy Yard|navy yard at Charlestown]] early in January 1945, and then moved to Norfolk where she served briefly as a school ship.

On 28 January, the destroyer escort departed Norfolk for duty with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]].  She transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 7 February and laid in a course for [[Manus Island|Manus]] in the [[Admiralty Islands]], where she arrived late in the month.

After a week of repairs at Manus, the warship received orders assigning her to the [[Philippine Sea Frontier]] and got underway for [[Leyte Island|Leyte]].  From March to September, she served under that command, escorting convoys both among the various islands of the [[Philippines]] and between the Philippines and American bases in other island groups.  Her first escort assignment was a round-trip voyage to [[Ulithi]] and back to Leyte.  In April, she saw a convoy safely to [[Hollandia, New Guinea]], and returned to Leyte with a formation of [[tugs]].

Early in May, she made a high-speed mail delivery on the Philippine circuit, visiting [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], [[Mindoro]], [[Iloilo]], [[Manila]], and [[Subic Bay]].  For the remainder of May and the entire month of June, she operated in the Philippines, either patrolling the entrance to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]], Leyte; escorting convoys from Leyte to Manila; or making the inter-island mail run.  In July, ''Weeden'' made two round-trip voyages escorting convoys between Leyte and Ulithi.  At the conclusion of the second run, she steamed to Subic Bay where she joined the escort of a convoy bound for [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]].  She departed Subic Bay on 27 July with a large group of LSTs and [[Landing Ship Medium|LSM]]s, and after evading a [[typhoon]], arrived at Okinawa on 4 August.  Three days later, the destroyer escort started back to Leyte.  During her return voyage, the [[atomic bomb]] fell on Japan; and soon after her arrival at Leyte, the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese capitulated]].

===Post-war activities, 1945&ndash;1946===
Over the next few weeks, ''Weeden'' completed escort missions in support of the developing [[Military occupation|occupation]] of former Japanese territory.  Late in August, she made a round-trip voyage to Okinawa and back to Manila.  Following that, the destroyer escort screened a British [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], where the latter ship picked up former Allied [[prisoners of war]] for [[repatriation]].  On the return voyage, ''Weeden'' herself carried 70 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] former prisoners as far as Okinawa and then continued on to Subic Bay for repairs.

En route, she received orders to assume [[plane guard]] duty on a station located about 100 miles north of [[Luzon]].  She performed that duty for four days and then resumed her voyage to the Philippines.  She arrived in Subic Bay on 26 September and remained there, undergoing repairs, until 10 November.

After a stop at Manila from 10 November to 26 November, ''Weeden'' got underway to return to the United States.  En route she stopped at [[Eniwetok]] and [[Pearl Harbor]] before arriving in [[San Pedro, California]], on 17 December.  After five months of inactivity, she was finally placed out of commission on 9 May 1946, and was berthed with the San Diego Group, [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]].

===Naval Reserve training, 1946&ndash;1957===
In November 1946, ''Weeden'' resumed activity though she remained out of commission.  On 20 November, she reported for duty training naval reservists in the [[11th Naval District]].  After almost four years of that duty, she changed status once more when she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 26 May 1950.  Almost three months later, ''Weeden'' reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet, though her mission, [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] training in the 11th Naval District, appears to have remained the same.  Over the next seven years her training cruises took her north to [[British Columbia]], south as far as [[Callao, Peru]], and west to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].  Her center of operations, however, remained the coast of California.

===Decommissioning and sale===
On 26 November 1957, ''Weeden'' began inactivation overhaul at [[Portland, Oregon]].  She was decommissioned on 26 February 1958 and was berthed at [[Astoria, Oregon]], with the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.  She remained there just over a decade until 30 June 1968, at which time her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]].  She was sold to [[Zidell Explorations, Inc.]], of Portland, Oregon, on 27 October 1969 for scrapping.
