==Biography==
Arn<U+00E1>iz, known in the monastery as '''Brother Mar<U+00ED>a Rafael''', was born on 9 April 1911, in the city of [[Burgos]], in north-central Spain. He was the first of four sons born to a well-to-do, deeply Catholic family. As a boy he went to several schools run by the [[Jesuit]] Fathers. By his adolescence it was clear that Arn<U+00E1>iz had human, intellectual, artistic and spiritual gifts. These qualities were well-balanced in him, producing an open, positive, joyful attitude to the world of persons and things, characterized by exuberant good humor, respect and humility.

After Arn<U+00E1>iz graduated from high school in 1930, he sought a deeper commitment to Christ began in 1930. As a graduation present, he spent his summer vacation with his Uncle Leopoldo and Aunt Mar<U+00ED>a, the Duke and Duchess of [[Maqueda]], at their residence near [[<U+00C1>vila, Spain|<U+00C1>vila]]. It marked the beginning of a deep and lasting friendship among them. At their encouragement, Arn<U+00E1>iz made his first contact that September with the [[Trappist]] [[Abbey]] of [[Due<U+00F1>as, Palencia|San Isidro de Due<U+00F1>as]]. He was attracted to the abbey's silent beauty and by the soaring melodies of their [[Gregorian chant]], such as the ''[[Salve Regina]]'' sung at [[Compline]]. Three years later, on 15 April 1934, having finished [[architect]]ural studies, he entered the community as a [[postulant]], then became a [[novice]], convinced that this was his true [[religious calling]].

From that moment, Arn<U+00E1>iz<U+2019>s career accelerated, for he lived only four more years, because of a severe case of [[diabetes]], which developed four months after his entering the abbey. The saddened, perplexed novice was forced to rest at home for a few months before returning to the abbey, which he did three successive times from 1935 through 1937, at the height of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Arn<U+00E1>iz was called into the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)#Military|Nationalist Army]] but was declared unfit for active duty. On his final return to the abbey, due to his medical condition he was obliged to enter as an conventual oblate instead of as a [[monk]], taking the last place and living on the margin of the community. This circumstance, however, revealed Arn<U+00E1>iz<U+2019>s intense vocational commitment and the generosity of his gift of self. He died in the abbey<U+2019>s [[infirmary]] at the age of 27, on 26 April 1938.

Despite his brief monastic life, Arn<U+00E1>iz embodied [[Cistercian]] grace in a pure and intense way. Allowing himself to be led through a series of bewildering contradictions and perplexities <U+2013> sickness, war, inability to pronounce his vows, abnormal community relations <U+2013> he renounced himself, his self-will and his human ideals. He lived with humiliation until, in death, he attained the essence of monastic vows<U+2014>though he was never allowed to [[profession (religious)|profess]] them officially. For Arn<U+00E1>iz, Christ was not the object of study but the companion of a transcendentally lived experience of absolute Love. His one desire was to live in order to love: love Jesus, love Mary, love the Cross, love his monastery. This love encapsulated his personal spirituality.

Arn<U+00E1>iz was proclaimed as a model for the youth of today by [[Pope John Paul II]], as part of the ceremony wherein he [[beatification|beatified]] him in 1992. He was [[canonization|canonized]] as a saint by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 11 October 2009.
