==Verdict==
On 25 March 2010, Judge Tom O'Donnell granted Limerick publicans an exemption from the state ban on opening on Good Friday. He recognised the potential for "controversy in several quarters".<ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/>

Under Section 10 of the Intoxicating liquor Act 1962, applicants must possess a license to trade in the area, the area must not be the county borough of Dublin, an event of significance must be occurring in the area and there must be "a considerable amount" of people in the area: the judge agreed with all four points.<ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/> O'Donnell noted that one hotelier had described the match as having "an international flavour as journalists from the UK were booked into his hotel to report on the game [...] that over 2,000-room nights would be availed of and that certain hotels [...] had to turn away pre and post match functions. He even equated the match to be on a par with the famous [[Galway Plate]]".<ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/> O'Donnell responded to comparisons with a 1961 application for a dance licence in [[Kilkee]], 1971 judicial remarks on the definition of a "special event" and a 1984 [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] case which sought to clarify if a wedding was considered a "special event" in law by saying that none were in any way like this case and that there was no legal definition for the term "special event".<ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/><ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/> O'Donnell described the application as "a last resort", observed that Thomond Park's stadium license would permit alcohol to be served on the day, that it would be "somewhat absurd" if the pubs lost out on business and also took into account that there were "health and safety reasons" for opening the pubs to serve the thousands of fans leaving the stadium when the match had ended.<ref name="Limerick pubs to open on Good Friday">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0325/limerick.html|title=Limerick pubs to open on Good Friday|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=27 March 2010|publisher=[[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref><ref name="Limerick pubs to open for game on Good Friday"/>

Publicans in Limerick were granted legal permission to trade between 18:00 and 23:30 on Good Friday 2010 (the application had sought hours of 18:00 until midnight).<ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/><ref name="Publicans toast court ruling on historic Good Friday opening"/> An area map delivered by the applicants had proposed the city of Limerick, Raheen Dooradoyle, Annacotty, Corbally, and Castletroy as the areas in which businesses would freely operate; the judge agreed with this and signed the map.<ref name="Cheers from publicans to landmark ruling"/>
