==Description==
[[File:Los Angeles, California. Lockheed Employment. A worried applicant waiting to be interviewed - NARA - 532210.tif|thumb|right|A job applicant with a worried facial expression]]
Anxiety is a generalized [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] that can occur without an identifiable triggering [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]]. As such, it is distinguished from [[fear]], which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. Additionally, fear is related to the specific behaviors of [[Fight-or-flight response|escape]] and avoidance, whereas anxiety is related to situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable.<ref>Ohman, A. (2000). Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives. In M. Lewis & J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.). ''Handbook of emotions''. (pp.573-593). New York: The Guilford Press.</ref> Another view defines anxiety as "a future-oriented mood state in which one is ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,"<ref>{{cite journal | last=Barlow | first=David H. | year=2002 | month=November | title=Unraveling the mysteries of anxiety and its disorders from the perspective of emotion theory | journal=American Psychologist | pages=1247<U+2013>63 | url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/55/11/1247.pdf | pmid=11280938 | volume=55 | issue=11}}</ref> suggesting that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. In a 2011 review of the literature,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sylvers|first=Patrick|coauthors=Jamie Laprarie and Scott Lilienfeld|title=Differences between trait fear and trait anxiety: Implications for psychopathology|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2011|month=February|volume=31|issue=1|pages=122<U+2013>137|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004}}</ref> fear and anxiety were said to be differentiated in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear was defined as short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat; while anxiety was defined as long acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting caution while approaching a potential threat.

'''Anxiety''' takes several forms: phobia, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and post-traumatic stress.<ref>Robin Henig[http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=Anxiety&facet%5B0%5D=addFacetValueFilters%28ContentType,Journal+Article%29, "ANXIETY!"], The New York Times Magazine 4 Oct. 2009: 1(L) </ref>. The '''physical effects''' of anxiety may include [[heart palpitations]], [[tachycardia]], [[muscle weakness]] and tension, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[chest pain]], [[shortness of breath]], [[headache]], [[stomach aches]], or [[tension headache|tension headaches]]. As the body prepares to deal with a threat, blood pressure, heart rate, perspiration, blood flow to the major muscle groups are increased, while [[immune system|immune]] and [[Digestion|digestive]] functions are inhibited (the ''[[fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]'' response). External signs of anxiety may include [[pallor]], sweating, trembling, and [[mydriasis|pupillary dilation]]. Someone who has anxiety might also experience it subjectively as a sense of dread or panic.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although [[panic attacks]] are not experienced by every person who has anxiety, they are a common symptom. Panic attacks usually come without warning and although the fear is generally irrational, the subjective perception of danger is very real. A person experiencing a panic attack will often feel as if he or she is about to die or lose consciousness. Between panic attacks, people with panic disorder tend to suffer from anticipated anxiety- a fear of having a panic attack may lead to the development of phobias.<ref>Neil R.Carlson, C.Donald Heth "Psychology the Science of Behaviour". Pearson Canada Inc.,Toronto, Ontario, 2010, p.558.</ref> '''Anxiety''' is the most common mental illness in America as approximately 40 million adults are affected by it.<ref>Robin Henig[http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=Anxiety&facet%5B0%5D=addFacetValueFilters%28ContentType,Journal+Article%29, "ANXIETY!"], The New York Times Magazine 4 Oct. 2009: 1(L) </ref>

The '''emotional effects''' of anxiety may include "feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching (and waiting) for signs (and occurrences) of danger, and, feeling like your mind's gone blank"<ref>Smith, Melinda (2008, June).

The '''cognitive effects''' of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying. "You may... fear that the chest pains are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head are the result of a tumor or aneurysm. You feel an intense fear when you think of dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can<U+2019>t get it out of your mind."<ref>(1987-2008). Anxiety symptoms - Fear of dying.

[[File:Nervous.jpg|thumb|alt=A young woman bites her fingernails.|Nervous habits such as biting fingernails]]
The '''behavioral effects''' of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.<ref name="Barker, P. 2003">Barker, P. (2003) ''Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing: The Craft of Care''. Edward Arnold, London.</ref> Anxiety can also be experienced in ways which include changes in sleeping patterns, nervous habits, and increased motor tension like foot tapping.<ref name="Barker, P. 2003"/>

==Symptoms==
The symptoms of anxiety include excessive and ongoing worry and tension, an unrealistic view of problems, restlessness or a feeling of being "edgy", irritability, muscle tension, headaches,sweating, difficulty concentrating, nausea, the need to go to the bathroom frequently, tiredness, trouble falling or staying asleep, trembling, and being easily startled.<ref>{{cite web|title=anxiety|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/anxiety/article|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> 

==Causes==
An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause [[false positive]] reactions but an individual suffering from anxiety may also avoid real threats.  This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0016242}}</ref>

The psychologist David H. Barlow of Boston University conducted a study that showed three common characteristics of people suffering from chronic anxiety, which he characterized as "a generalized biological vulnerability," "a generalized psychological vulnerability," and "a specific psychological vulnerability."<ref>{{cite book |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |last=Barlow |first=David H. |last2=Durand |first2=Vincent |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |page=125 |isbn=0-534-58156-0}}</ref> While chemical issues in the brain that result in anxiety (especially resulting from genetics) are well documented, this study highlights an additional environmental factor that may result from being raised by parents suffering from chronic anxiety themselves.

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their [[nucleus accumbens]] is more sensitive than that in other people when selecting to make an action that determined whether they received a reward.<ref name="Bar-Haim">Bar-Haim Y, Fox NA, Benson B, Guyer AE, Williams A, Nelson EE, Perez-Edgar K, Pine DS, Ernst M. (2009). Neural correlates of reward processing in adolescents with a history of inhibited temperament. Psychol Sci. 20(8):1009-18. PMID 19594857</ref> This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, "a sense of <U+2018>responsibility,<U+2019> or self agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents."<ref name="Bar-Haim"/>

Neural circuitry involving the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] is thought to underlie anxiety.<ref name="Rosen">{{cite journal |author=Rosen JB, Schulkin J |title=From normal fear to pathological anxiety |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=325<U+2013>50 |year=1998 |pmid=9577241 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.105.2.325}}</ref> When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, [[Positron emission tomography|PET-scans]] show increased bloodflow in the [[amygdala]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zald|first=D.H.|year=1997|title=Emotion, olfaction, and the human amygdala: amygdala activation during aversive olfactory stimulation|journal=Proc Nat'l Acad Sci|volume=94|issue=8|pages=4119<U+2013>24|location=USA|pmid=9108115|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.8.4119|last2=Pardo|first2=JV|pmc=20578}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zald|first=D.H.|date=1 February 2002|title=Neural correlates of tasting concentrated quinine and sugar solutions|journal=J.

This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

Although single genes have little effect on complex traits and interact heavily both [[epistasis|between themselves]] and with the external factors, research is underway to unravel possible molecular mechanisms underlying anxiety and comorbid conditions. One candidate gene with [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s that influence anxiety is [[PLXNA2]].<ref name="pmid17339520">{{cite journal |author=Wray NR, James MR, Mah SP, Nelson M, Andrews G, Sullivan PF, Montgomery GW, Birley AJ, Braun A, Martin NG |title=Anxiety and comorbid measures associated with PLXNA2 |journal=[[Arch.

===In medicine===
{{Main|Anxiety disorder}}
Anxiety can be a symptom of an underlying health issue such as [[COPD|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]], heart failure, or [[heart arrythmia]].<ref name="npsreview">[http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/prescribing_practice_review/current/prescribing_practice_review_48 NPS Prescribing Practice Review 48: Anxiety disorders], [[National Prescribing Service]] (Australia)</ref>

Abnormal and pathological anxiety or fear may itself be a medical condition falling under the blanket term "anxiety disorder". Such conditions came under the aegis of psychiatry at the end of the 19th century<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00036-1 |author=Berrios GE |title=Anxiety Disorders: a conceptual history |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=56 |issue=2<U+2013>3 |pages=83<U+2013>94 |year=1999 |pmid=10701465}}</ref> and current psychiatric diagnostic criteria recognize several specific forms of the disorder.
Recent surveys have found that as many as 18% of Americans may be affected by one or more of them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE |title=Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Arch.

Standardized screening tools such as [[Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale]], [[Beck Anxiety Inventory]], [[Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale]] and HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) can be used to detect anxiety [[symptom]]s and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment of anxiety disorder.<ref>Zung WWK. A rating instrument for anxiety disorders. Psychosomatics. 1971; 12: 371-379 PMID 5172928</ref>
The HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) measures the severity of a patient's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview.<ref>Psychiatric Times.

===Existential anxiety===

{{See|Angst|Existential crisis|Nihilism}}

The philosopher [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard]], in ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]],'' described anxiety or dread associated with the "dizziness of freedom" and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of  responsibility and choosing. In ''Art and Artist'' (1932), the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] wrote that the [[psychological trauma]] of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person's simultaneous fear of <U+2013> and desire for <U+2013> separation, individuation and differentiation.

The [[theology|theologian]] [[Paul Tillich]] characterized existential anxiety<ref name="Tillich">[[Paul Tillich|Tillich, Paul]], (1952). ''The Courage To Be'', New Haven: Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-08471-4</ref> as "the state in which a [[being]] is aware of its possible nonbeing" and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), [[Morality|moral]] ([[guilt]] and condemnation), and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] (emptiness and [[Meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]]). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods.  Tillich argues that this anxiety can be [[Acceptance#Self_acceptance|accepted]] as part of the [[human condition]] or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to "drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by [[tradition]] and [[authority]]" even though such "undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of [[reality]]".

According to [[Viktor Frankl]], the author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a [[meaning of life]] to combat the "trauma of nonbeing" as death is near.

===Test and performance anxiety===<!-- This section is linked from [[Educational psychology]] -->
{{Main|Test anxiety|Mathematical anxiety|Stage fright|Somatic anxiety}}
According to [[Yerkes-Dodson law]], an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who had a fear of failing an [[Test (student assessment)|exam]]. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of [[Grade (education)|grades]] with [[Self-esteem|personal worth]]; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of [[Social alienation|alienation]] from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control.  Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia.

While the term "test anxiety" refers specifically to students, many workers share the same experience with regard to their career or profession. The fear of failing at a task and being negatively evaluated for failure can have a similarly negative effect on the adult.

===Stranger and social anxiety===

{{Main|Stranger anxiety|Social anxiety}}

Anxiety when meeting or interacting with unknown people is a common stage of development in young people. For others, it may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia.  "[[Stranger anxiety]]" in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called [[social anxiety]]. According to Cutting,<ref>Cutting, P., Hardy, S. and Thomas, B. 1997 ''Mental Health Nursing: Principles and Practice'' Mosby, London.</ref> social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

[[Social anxiety]] varies in degree and severity. Whilst for some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. There can be a tendency among those suffering from this condition to restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Generalized anxiety===

{{See|Generalized anxiety disorder|Cognitive behavioral therapy|}}

Overwhelming anxiety, if not treated early, can consequently become a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which can be identified by symptoms of exaggerated and excessive worry, chronic anxiety, and constant, irrational thoughts.  The anxious thoughts and feelings felt while suffering from GAD are difficult to control and can cause serious mental anguish that interferes with normal, daily functioning.<ref>Generalized anxiety disorder: People who worry about everything--and nothing in particular--have several treatment options. (2011). Harvard Mental Health Letter, 27(12), 1-3. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref>  

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]]) includes specific criteria for diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder.  The DSM-IV states that a patient must experience chronic anxiety and excessive worry, almost daily, for at least 6 months due to a number of stressors (such as work or school) and experience three or more defined symptoms, including, <U+201C>restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep).<U+201D><ref>Andrews, G., Hobbs, M. J., Borkovec, T. D., Beesdo, K., Craske, M. G., Heimberg, R. G., & ... Stanley, M. A. (2010). Generalized worry disorder: a review of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder and options for DSM-V. Depression & Anxiety (1091-4269), 27(2), 134-147. {{doi|10.1002/da.20658}}</ref> 

If symptoms of chronic anxiety are not addressed and treated in adolescence then the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in adulthood increases significantly.<ref name="Ellis D 2011">Ellis D, Hudson J. The Metacognitive Model of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Children and Adolescents. Clinical Child & Family Psychology Review [serial online]. June 2010;13(2):151-163. Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed September 29, 2011.</ref> <U+201C>Clinical worry is also associated with risk of comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and depression<U+201D> which is why immediate treatment is so important.<ref name="Ellis D 2011"/> 

Generalized anxiety disorder can be treated through specialized therapies aimed at changing thinking patterns and in turn reducing anxiety-producing behaviors.  [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) can be used to successfully treat GAD with positive effects lasting 12 months after treatment.<ref>Salzer, S., Winkelbach, C., Leweke, F., Leibing, E., & Leichsenring, F. (2011). Long-Term Effects of Short-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy in Generalized Anxiety Disorder: 12-Month Follow-Up. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 56(8), 503-508. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref> There are also other treatment plans that should be discussed with a knowledgeable health care practitioner, which can be used in conjunction with behavioral therapy to greatly reduce the disabling symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

===Trait anxiety===
Anxiety can be either a short term 'state' or a long term "trait." Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency to respond with state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html | title = Anxiety | last = Schwarzer | first = R. | date = December 1997 | accessdate = 2008-01-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070920115547/http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/anxiety.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-20}}</ref> It is closely related to the personality trait of [[neuroticism]]. Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.<ref>Giddey, M. and Wright, H. ''Mental Health Nursing: From first principles to professional practice'' Stanley Thornes Ltd. UK.''</ref>

===Choice or decision anxiety===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organisations:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article3778818.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Premium choice anxiety | date=April 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 25, 2010 | first1=Jonathan | last1=Downey}}</ref><ref>Gates, Kathy.

===Paradoxical anxiety===
{{Further2|[[Health applications and clinical studies of meditation#Adverse effects|Adverse effects of meditation]]}}

Paradoxical anxiety is anxiety arising from use of methods or techniques which are normally used to reduce anxiety.  This includes relaxation or meditation techniques<ref>{{cite book| title=The anxiety & phobia workbook |edition=4th |publisher=New Harbinger Publications |last=Bourne |first=Edmund J. |year=2005 |page=369 |isbn=1-57224-413-5}}</ref> as well as use of certain medications.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1037/0022-006X.51.2.171| title=Relaxation-Induced Anxiety: Paradoxical Anxiety Enhancement Due to Relaxation Training |last=Heide |first=Frederick J. |last2=Borkovec |first2=T.
