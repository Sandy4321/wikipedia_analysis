== Shooting ==
On the day of the shooting, the start of school had been delayed by snow and not all students had arrived when the shooting began.<ref name="KOLOTV" /> Just before 9:00 a.m. ([[UTC-8]]), fourteen-year-old student James Scott Newman brought his mother's [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] to school in his backpack.<ref name="NewsReview" /><ref name="LasVegasReview">{{cite news

Alexander Rueda was treated at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and released the same day, while Kenzie McKeonin only needed to be treated at the scene for superficial wounds.<ref name="LATimes" /> The school was placed on [[lockdown]] for an hour and then classes were canceled for the remainder of the day.<ref name="FoxNews" /> The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On this occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.<ref name="NewsReview" />

===Motive===
After the shooting, Newman was interviewed by the police and remained determined that he did not want his parents to be present during questioning, however Newman's father had arrived sometime after to ask for the questioning to stop until a lawyer would be consulted.<ref name="Sosandiego" /><ref name="LasVegasReview" /> During questioning Newman stated that he wanted to use the attack as a way to end abuse from his father, brother, and others. He said he was tired of being called "stupid" by them.<ref name="LasVegasReview" /> He researched the [[Columbine High School massacre]] on the [[Internet]] and planned the attack about a week in advance.<ref name="LasVegasReview" /> He conclusively decided against using a knife because "he did not want to be up close when blood came out of any of the victims."<ref name="LasVegasReview" />  The night before the attack, Newman's father had given him a collection of ammunition which included three live .38 caliber rounds. When his parents left the house to eat, he took his mother's handgun from a small safe in his father's closet and hid it in his backpack.<ref name="LasVegasReview" />

== Aftermath ==
Following the shooting, police arrested James Newman and booked him as an adult on charges of suspicion of attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor in Washoe County Jail with a [[bail]] of [[United States dollar|$]]150,000.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news
