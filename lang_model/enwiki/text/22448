'''German submarine ''U-28''''' was a [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIA|Type VIIA]] [[U-boat]] of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]].

Her keel was laid down on 2 December 1935, by [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]]. She was [[ship launching|launched]] on 14 July 1936, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the ''Kriegsmarine'' on 12 September 1936, with ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Wilhelm Ambrosius in command. Ambrosius was succeeded by nine other commanding officers over the next eight years.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

''U-28'' conducted seven war patrols between 19 August 1939 and 15 November 1940, all under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' [[G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke]], sinking 13 ships totaling {{GRT|56,272|first=y}} and damaging two others totaling {{GRT|10,067}}.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

After her third patrol, ''U-28'' became a training vessel and was used to bring new U-boat crews up to standard. She was later sunk in an accident on 17 March 1944 and stricken on 4 August 1944.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

==Construction and design==
===Construction===
''U-28'' was ordered by the German ''Kriegsmarine'' on 1 April 1935 as part of the German [[Plan Z]] and in violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Her keel was laid down in the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in Bremen as ''Werk'' 909 on 2 December 1935. After about ten months of construction, she was launched on 14 July 1936 and commissioned into the ''Kriegsmarine'' as the third Type VIIA submarine on 12 September 1936 under the command of ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' Wilhelm Ambrosius.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

===Design===
{{main|German Type VII submarine}}
Like all Type VIIA submarines, ''U-28'' displaced {{convert|626|t|LT|0}} while surfaced and {{convert|745|t|LT|0|abbr=on}} when submerged. She was {{convert|64.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in overall length and had a {{convert|44.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} pressure hull. ''U-28''{{'}}s propulsion consisted of two [[MAN SE|MAN]] 6-cylinder 4-stroke M6V 40/46 [[diesel engine]]s that totaled {{convert|2100|-|2310|bhp|abbr=on}}. Her maximum [[rpm]] was between 470 and 485. The submarine was also equipped with two [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] GG UB 720/8 electric motors that totaled {{convert|750|shp|abbr=on}}. Their maximum rpm was 322. These power plants gave ''U-28'' a maximum speed of {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|lk=in}} while surfaced and {{convert|8|kn|mph km/h}} when submerged. She had a range of {{convert|6200|nmi|km|abbr=on|lk=on}} while traveling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} on the surface and {{convert|73|-|94|nmi|km|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} when submerged. 

The U-boat's test depth was {{convert|220|m|ft|abbr=on}} but she could go as deep as {{convert|230|-|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} without having her hull crushed. ''U-28''{{'}}s armament consisted of five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, (four located in the bow and one in the stern). She could have up to 11 torpedoes on board or 22 TMA mines or 33 TMB mines. ''U-28'' was also equipped with a C35 88&nbsp;mm gun/L45 [[deck gun]] with 220 rounds. Her anti-aircraft defenses consisted of one [[2 cm FlaK 30|C30 20 mm AA gun]].<ref name=Type/><ref name=Aces/>

==Service history==
===First patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s first war patrol took place from 19 August to 29 September 1939. On 14 September, while sailing around the mouth of [[St George's Channel]], ''U-28'' sank a 5,000&nbsp;ton freighter, which was her only success of the patrol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_196.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol info for U-28 (First patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009 }}</ref>

===Second patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s second war patrol took place from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was instructed to [[Minelayer|lay a minefield]] near the port city of [[Swansea]]. En route to [[Bristol]], ''U-28'' sank two ships; the 5,000&nbsp;ton Dutch tanker MV ''Sliedrecht'' and the 5,100&nbsp;ton British freighter SS ''Royston Grange''. ''U-28'' then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600&nbsp;ton British freighter SS ''Protesilaus'' 60 days after it was laid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_197.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol of U-boat U-28 (Second patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

===Third patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s third sortie took place from 18 February to 25 March 1940. She was instructed to lay mines off the British Naval Base at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]]. After ''U-28'' laid the minefield, she went on to sink two ships for 11,200&nbsp;tons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_198.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol info for U-28 (Third patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009 }}</ref>

===Fourth patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s fourth war patrol took place from 8 June to 7 July 1940. She was sent to the [[Western Approaches]] and turned in an average performance of sinking three ships totalling 10,300&nbsp;tons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_199.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol info for U-28 (Fourth patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> The Irish government sought an explanation from Germany for the sinking of the neutral Greek ship ''Adamandios Georgandis'': "the entire cargo of which comprised grain for exclusive consumption in <U+00C9>ire"<ref>{{cite book|last=Duggan|first=John P|title=Herr Hempel|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=2003|page=111|isbn=0-7165-2757-X}}</ref> She was sailing from [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] (in Argentina) to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with a cargo of [[wheat]] when she was torpedoed and sunk<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/363.html|title=Adamandios Georgandis|work=Ships hit by U-boats|publisher=u-boat.net|accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> south-west of Ireland at {{coord|43.35|N|11.15|W|display=inline}}.

===Fifth patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s fifth war patrol took place from 11 August to 17 September 1940 and was one of Kuhnke's most productive. In August, she sank two ships for 5,500&nbsp;tons. On 10 September, ''U-28'' found and tracked [[ON convoys|Convoy OA 210]]. In the darkness of early morning on 11 September, ''U-28'' attacked the convoy and claimed two large freighters (13,000&nbsp;tons each) sunk and caused damage to a 10,000&nbsp;ton tanker, bringing Kuhnke's total for the patrol to five ships for 30,000&nbsp;tons. However, during the postwar analysis, he was only credited with sinking a 2,000&nbsp;ton Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700&nbsp;ton British freighter; which, combined with his earlier sinkings, brought his total to four ships for 9,945&nbsp;tons. On his return to [[Lorient]] Kuhnke was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] for his work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_200.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol info for U-28 (Fifth patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

===Sixth patrol===
''U-28''{{'}}s sixth and final war patrol took her from Lorient back to Germany; because of the heavy seas and foul weather, ''U-28'' sank only half a ship for 2,694&nbsp;tons. (''U-28'' and {{GS|U-31|1936|2}} shared credit for the sinking of the SS ''Matina''). On 15 November 1940, she returned to Germany and was turned over to the training command. G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke proceeded to command {{GS|U-125|1940|2}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_202.html|first=Gu<U+00F0>mundur|last=Helgason|title=Patrol info for U-28 (Sixth patrol)|work=U-boat patrols|publisher=Uboat.net |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

==Fate==
''U-28'' sank by accident on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in [[Neustadt in Holstein|Neustadt]]. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed to note the position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's [[conning tower]] was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.<ref name="uboatnet"/>
