[[Image:HollandFenPumpingStation.jpg|thumb|right|The Holland Fen pumping station, which pumps water from Clay Dike into the South Forty-Foot Drain]]
The '''South Forty-Foot Drain''' is the main channel for the land-drainage of the Black Sluice Level in the [[Lincolnshire]] [[The Fens|Fens]].  It lies in eastern [[England]] between Guthram Gowt and the Black Sluice pumping station on [[The Haven, Boston|The Haven]], at [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]. The Drain has its origins in the 1630s, when the first scheme to make the Fen land available for agriculture was carried out by the Earl of Lindsay, and has been steadily improved since then. Water drained from the land entered The Haven by gravity at certain states of the tide until 1946, when the Black Sluice pumping station was commissioned. 

The Drain was navigable until the 1960s, when improvements to the pumping station led to the entrance lock being removed. It is currently being upgraded to navigable status by the Environment Agency, as part of the [[Fens Waterways Link]], with the new entrance lock expected to be completed in December 2008, and the upgrading of the southern section, including a link to the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]] to allow navigation to [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] forming phase 2 of the project.

==History==
The Lincolnshire Fens are an area of low-lying land which have been subject to flooding and attempts to prevent it for centuries. In medieval times, the Midfen Dyke was built to drain the area, but by 1500, this was regarded less as a drain for the land than as a [[boundary marker]] between the [[Holland, Lincolnshire|Parts of Holland]] and the [[Parts of Kesteven]], two of the three medieval subdivisions of Lincolnshire which functioned as county councils until their abolition in 1974. The first serious attempt to drain the area to the south west of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], now known as the Black Sluice Area but formerly known as the Lindsay Level, was from 1635 to 1638, when the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsay]] agreed with the Commissioners of Sewers for Lincolnshire to carry out drainage works which would make {{convert|36000|acre|ha}} of land available for agricultural use. The Earl and his colleagues paid for the works, in return for land grants.<ref name="bsidb">{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksluiceidb.gov.uk/history.html|title=History of the Draining of the Fens in the Black Sluice Area|last=Staff|publisher=The Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board|accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref>

The cost of the work was <U+00A3>45,000, and involved the construction of a sluice near Boston, called Skirbeck Sluice, the construction of the first {{convert|8|mi|km}} of the South Forty-Foot Drain, from Boston to [[Great Hale]], the construction of two drains from there to Guthram, which were called the Double Twelves, and the construction of the Clay Dyke Drain. The scheme was not popular with local landowners, who destroyed much of the work and burnt the Skirbeck Sluice. The Earl of Lindsay's contract with the Commissioners of Sewers was revoked by parliament, and it was another hundred years before the next attempt to drain the area.<ref name=bsidb/>

In an attempt to drain Holland Fen, and prevent flooding from the [[River Witham]], an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close to the location of the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.<ref name=sly/>

===The Second Sluice===
In 1762, the Witham Act was passed by Parliament, and among other things constituted the Commissioners of Sewers for the Second and Sixth District, which covered the area including [[Asgarby, Sleaford|Asgarby]], [[Ewerby]], Great Hale, [[Heckington]], Holland Fen, [[Howell, Lincolnshire|Howell]], [[Little Hale]] and South Kyme. Much of the area was inundated by the Great Flood of 1763, and against this background, an [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained in 1765 which created the Black Sluice Commissioners, giving them power to raise taxes and authority to carry out drainage works. The scheme largely revived the Earl of Lindsay's original scheme. A new [[sluice]], called the Black Sluice, was built at Boston as a direct replacement for the Skirbeck Sluice, while the South Forty-Foot Drain was scoured from Boston to Great Hale, and extended by {{convert|13|mi|km}} to Guthram. A total of {{convert|65|mi|km}} of highland streams were improved by scouring and raising of the banks. The estimated cost of <U+00A3>16,000 was raised by issuing bonds, but the project overran, and another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1770 to authorise the raising of the drainage taxes, to cover the difference.<ref name=bsidb/>

On the [[River Witham]], the Grand Sluice was constructed and opened on 15 October 1766, and this prevented tidal water from entering the river, and hence flooding the Holland Fen. The Boston Harbour Commissioners were created by the Boston Port Act of 1766, and they carried out improvement works to [[The Haven]], which resulted in lower water levels at the Black Sluice, and hence more efficient draining from the South Forty-Foot Drain. Water was pumped into the drain by a series of windmills driving scoop wheels. Maps of the area produced in 1783 by Edward Hare show 46 such mills, which provided drainage for {{convert|32000|acre|ha}} of agricultural land. Extreme high tides in 1810 and again in 1820 resulted in widespread flooding, and further thought was given to improving the flood defences.<ref name=bsidb/>

With the improvements to the River Witham, the final section of Earl Fitzwilliam's drain to Lodewick Gowt was filled in, and the channel was diverted to join the South Forty-Foot Drain. Renamed the North Forty-Foot Drain, it now supplies Cooks Lock and Holland Fen pumping stations.<ref name=sly/>

===The Third Sluice===
Reports on improvements to the system were produced in 1843 by the surveyor Mr W Lewin and in 1845 by [[John Rennie the Younger|Sir John Rennie]]. Rennie's scheme involved the provision of a [[Catchwater drain|catchwater drain]] to collect water draining from the higher ground to the west before it entered the fenlands, but an Act of Parliament to authorise its construction was defeated, and so in 1846 a report by Mr W Cubit which proposed improvements to the existing infrastructure was accepted by the Commissioners. A new Black Sluice, including a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} navigation lock, was constructed to the south of the original one, with the cill level {{convert|6|ft|m}} lower, which enabled the gradient of the South Forty-Foot Drain to be increased to 3 inches per mile (5 cm per km). Many of the tributary drains were also improved. 1846 also marked the beginning of the use of steam engines for pumping. Ten years later, a map covering {{convert|18000|acre|ha}} of the Black Sluice area showed nine steam-powered and eight wind-powered drainage engines in use.<ref name=bsidb/>

The River Witham Outfall Improvement Act of 1880 authorised further improvements to the mouth of the Witham, to which the Black Sluice Commissioners contributed <U+00A3>65,000. This work led to a further drop of {{convert|4|ft|m}} in the low water level at the Black Sluice. Oil and [[paraffin]] engines began to replace steam and wind engines from 1910, and by 1935 there were 15 such engines pumping water into the South Forty-Foot Drain. The passing of the Land Drainage Act in 1930 resulted in the Commissioners being replaced by the Black Sluice [[Internal Drainage Board]],<ref name=bsidb/> while responsibility for the rivers in the area passed to the Witham and Steeping Rivers Catchment Board.<ref name="sly">{{cite book|last=Sly|first=Rex|title=From Punt to Plough - A History of the Fens|publisher=Sutton Publishers|location=Stroud, England|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7509-3398-8|accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref> With war imminent, the Rivers Board took over the Black Sluice and the South Forty-Foot Drain in 1939, and although progess was interrupted by the [[Second World War]], a <U+00A3>374,000 scheme to construct the Black Sluice pumping station and to widen {{convert|11|mi|km}} of the drain from Boston to Donington Bridge was completed in 1946.<ref name=bsidb/> The pumping station contained three {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} pumps, each powered by a {{convert|900|hp|kW}} 5-cylinder vertical diesel engine manufactured by [[Ruston (engine builder)|Ruston]].<ref name=sly/>

===The modern era===
Paraffin and oil engines gave way to electrically powered pumping stations in the 1950s, with the Board constructing six electric and one diesel pumping station to improve drainage to an extra {{convert|11000|acre|ha}} of land. In 1960, the decision was taken to further improve drainage of an area of {{convert|70000|acre|ha}}, as part of a <U+00A3>1.4 million scheme which included the addition of two extra pumps at the Black Sluice, replacement of existing pumps elsewhere, and the widening of {{convert|7|mi|km}} of the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington Bridge to Rippingale Running Dyke. Jurisdiction for the Drain and the sluice passed to the Lincolnshire River Board at this time. The work, which began in 1962 and was completed in 1968, proved successful in preventing flooding during severe wet weather in the winter of 1968/9.<ref name=bsidb/> With three {{convert|900|hp|kW}} and two {{convert|925|hp|kW}} diesel engines, the upgraded pumping station can pump 800,000 gallons per minute (60 m3/sec). Responsibility for the drain and the sluice passed to the [[National Rivers Authority]] in 1990, and to the [[Environment Agency]] in 1995.<ref name=sly/>

Despite all the improvements, serious flooding occurred in 1999 when the bank of the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review of the flood defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.blacksluiceidb.gov.uk/future-plans.html | publisher = Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board |title = Future plans for the Black Sluice area |accessdate = 18 December 2008}}</ref>

==Functions==
[[Image:BlackSluicePumpingStationBoston.JPG|thumb|right|Black Sluice pumping station at Boston, where the Drain meets The Haven]]
The South Forty-Foot Drain serves as a district boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north. South of Donington High Bridge, the Drain separates [[South Kesteven]] to the west from [[South Holland, Lincolnshire|South Holland]] to the east. The boundary then continues southwards along the River Glen. North of Donington, the boundary between the [[Boston (borough)|borough of Boston]] to the east and [[North Kesteven]] to the west follows the line of the Drain. As the Drain crosses the line of the Midfen Dyke, just before the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Nottingham to Boston railway]] joins it at Great Hale pumping station, the boundary turns northwards, following its medieval course. 

The main job of the Drain is to gather the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a [[soak dike]] in Bourne North Fen, alongside the [[Bourne Eau]] and [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]], northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke takes its name from a [[weir]] in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Miles |first = W. D. |year =1976 |title = A History of the Drainage of Bourne South Fen and Thurlby Fen |publisher = Welland and Deepings IDB}}</ref> The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.<ref name=bsidb/>

The South Forty-Foot Drain and the Black Sluice pumping station, together with most of the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the drainage ditches which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksluiceidb.gov.uk/pumping-stations.html |title=Pumping Stations |publisher=The Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board|accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref> Of these, 21 are situated on the banks of the Drain, and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove pumping station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of the Drain managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksluiceidb.gov.uk/images/board-map.jpg  |publisher=The Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board  |title=Map of the Area|accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref>

==Navigation==
[[Image:BlackSluiceLockBoston.jpg|thumb|right|The new lock being constructed at Black Sluice, which will allow navigation from The Haven to the Drain]] 
Prior to the 1960s, the Drain had been navigable, but this privilege was removed at that time, with little protest being made. More recently, the [[East Anglian Waterways Association]] promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable as part of a larger scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the ''Fens Tourism'' consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the [[Fens Waterways Link]] by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the [[Inland Waterways Association]].<ref name=iwa>{{cite web

The scheme involves a total of {{convert|150|mi|km}} of waterway, of which {{convert|50|mi|km}} will be new cruiseway, while the rest will be existing waterways which will be upgraded or have their access improved. When completed, it will connect the Rivers [[River Witham|Witham]], Glen, [[River Welland|Welland]], [[River Nene|Nene]] and [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]], and is being heralded as the biggest waterway enhancement project in Europe by the [[Environment Agency]].<ref>

In 2007 they obtained funding for the link between Boston and [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]].  Work on a new lock beside the Black Sluice pumping station at [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] - to connect The Haven and the South Forty-Foot Drain - was formally started on February 8, 2008,<ref>IWA Head Office Bulletin - March 2008 - Issue 134</ref> and is expected to be completed by December 2008, with an official opening ceremony on 20 March 2009<ref name=lwp17>Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, ''Newsletter 17'', November 2008</ref> Funding for phase 2 of the project, which will involve widening of the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to a new road crossing under the A151, a new lock and a junction with the River Glen at Guthram Gowt has been secured from the East Midlands Development Agency.<ref>Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, ''Newsletter 15'', March 2008</ref> This section will also involve changes at Black Hole Drove pumping station, which has been built across the drain and hence would prevent navigation.<ref name=iwa/> Major contracts for this phase are expected to be awarded in April 2009.<ref name=lwp17/>

As part of the upgrade, new moorings have been constructed on The Haven, for boats about to enter the Drain, and on the South Forty-Foot Drain at Boston, near the Black Sluice pumping station, at Swineshead Bridge and at Hubbert's Bridge. Water levels are maintained at a lower level during the winter months, when flows are high, and the Drain needs to be able to cope with higher volumes of rainfall, than during the summer months. On the neighbouring [[River Witham]], the switch between winter and summer levels is normally made at the beginning of April, and a similar regime is likely to be adopted on the South Forty-Foot Drain.<ref name=lwp17/>
