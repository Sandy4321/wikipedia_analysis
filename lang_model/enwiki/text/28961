}}
'''General aviation in the United Kingdom''' has been defined as a civil [[aircraft]] operation other than a [[Airline|commercial air transport]] flight operating to a schedule. Although the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The sector operates [[business jet]]s, [[rotorcraft]], [[Reciprocating engine|piston]] and [[jet-engine]]d [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[glider]]s of all descriptions, and [[Aerostat|lighter than air]] craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and [[air taxi]] services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as [[Aerial survey|surveying]] and [[Air Ambulances in the United Kingdom|air ambulances]], and [[flight training]], which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. [[Private aviation|Private flying]] is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of [[air sports]], such as racing, [[aerobatics]], and [[parachuting]], at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.

Of the 27,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing [[light aircraft]] associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft, such as [[Ultralight aviation|microlights]], [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur built]] aeroplanes, and smaller [[helicopters]]. There are 28,000 [[Private Pilot Licence]] holders, and 10,000 [[Gliding#Badges|certified glider pilots]]. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 [[aerodrome]]s and landing sites, ranging in size from large [[regional airport]]s to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes <U+00A3>1.4 billion to the UK economy.

GA is regulated by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA). The main focus is on standards of [[airworthiness]] and [[Pilot licensing in the United Kingdom|pilot licensing]], and the objective is to promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and [[gliding]] is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. [[Airspace]] regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planning system]] has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.

==Definitions==

[[Image:G-oldw (2099547348).jpg|thumb|left|Business aviation is a commercial activity that is considered part of the GA sector.]]
The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) defines general aviation (GA) as "an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation." It defines [[Airline|commercial air transport]] (CAT) as "an aircraft operation involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire", and aerial work as "an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertisement, etc."<ref name="CAA_Definition">{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/RegReview.pdf|title= Regulatory Review of General Aviation in the United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07-06|pages= p. 3<U+2013>1 (section 3.1) and p. D-1 (Annex D)}}</ref>

Organisations in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) describe GA in less restrictive terms that include elements of [[commercial aviation]]. The British Business and General Aviation Association interprets it to be "all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the Armed Services".<ref name="BBGA_Industry">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbga.aero/aviation-industry.php|title= What is General Aviation?|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= British Business and General Aviation Association}}</ref> The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description "all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire".<ref name="GAAC_Definition">{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/ga/what_is_ga.htm|title= What is General Aviation?|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= General Aviation Awareness Council|date= 2006-07-06}}</ref> For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) defined the scope of GA as "a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. i, paras. 9<U+2013>10}} This article uses the CAA description to define the scope of general aviation in the UK, on the basis that this organisation is the regulatory body for aviation in the UK and the publisher of a key source.</ref>

==History==

[[Image:Amy Johnson jason india.jpg|thumb|[[Amy Johnson]] and her [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth]] 'Jason']]
The first [[aerodrome]] in the UK was established by the [[Royal Aero Club|Aero Club]] at Muswell Manor on the [[Isle of Sheppey]], and in May 1909 it was the venue of the first flight conducted in the country by a British [[Aviator|pilot]], [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara|John Moore-Brabazon]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.muswellmanorholidaypark.com/aviation_history.htm|title= Aviation History at Muswell Manor in Leysdown|accessdate=2008-07-04 |publisher= Muswell Manor Holiday Park}} The 16 October 1908 flight at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] by American [[Samuel Franklin Cody|Samuel F. Cody]] is [http://www.raes.org.uk/2008/watershed.htm officially recognised] as the first powered aeroplane flight in Britain.</ref> In 1910 the Aero Club was granted the Royal prefix, took responsibility for controlling all [[Private aviation|private flying]] in the UK, and started issuing the first British pilot licences. The introduction of the [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth]] in 1925 revolutionised light aviation, and the Royal Aero Club, recognising the "vital necessity of promoting civil flying", formed the Light Aeroplane Club scheme. Between 1925 and 1939 around 60 [[flying club]]s were started, and more than 5,000 pilots were trained.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.royalaeroclub.org/history.htm|title= A Brief History of the Royal Aero Club|accessdate=2008-07-04 |publisher= [[Royal Aero Club]]}}</ref>

During [[World War II]] civil aerodromes were taken over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built.<ref>{{cite book | last = Rowley | first = Trevor | title = The English Landscape in the Twentieth Century | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | date = 2006 | pages = p. 318 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=SZWI2kYEhTcC&pg=RA1-PA318&lpg=RA1-PA318&dq=%22Emergency+Powers+(Defence)+Act%22+airfields&source=web&ots=EqV75CxIdn&sig=up-tUV1gXi2nuzeWbRQ6mvQAbEY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PRA1-PA310,M1 | isbn = 1852853883}}</ref> This resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war.

With an expanded infrastructure in place, GA became established after the war when manufacturers such as [[Cessna]] and [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] introduced [[light aircraft]] designed for the private market. The [[Cessna 172]], developed from the late 1940s [[Cessna 170]], was introduced in 1956, and became the world's best selling single-engine aeroplane.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/cessna.html|title= Cessna's Golden Oldie |accessdate=2008-07-11 |year= 2006 |month=July |journal= Air & Space Magazine}}</ref> Single [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the UK GA fleet.<ref name="GA_Aircraft"/> The development of the [[Rogallo wing]] in the 1950s fostered the [[History of hang gliding|development of hang-gliding]] during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=2|title= History of Microlighting <U+2013> 1940<U+2013>1969 |accessdate=2008-07-12 |publisher= British Microlight Aircraft Association}}</ref> The 1960s also saw experiments with motorised [[Hang gliding|hang glider]]s, but it was not until the 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature, resulting in the birth of the [[Ultralight aviation|microlight]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=3|title= History of Microlighting <U+2013> 1970<U+2013>1976 |accessdate=2008-07-12 |publisher= British Microlight Aircraft Association}}</ref> Another milestone in the development of GA was the 1964 introduction of the [[Learjet 23]]. Although it was not the first [[business jet]], it popularised corporate aviation, and established the personal jet as a "whole new class of aircraft".<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/Aircraft_That_Changed_the_World.html?c=y&page=4|title= Aircraft That Changed the World |accessdate=2008-07-12 |year= 2008 |month=July |journal= Air & Space Magazine}}</ref>

The GA sector operates a range of aircraft, including [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and [[airship]]s, [[glider]]s, hang gliders, [[Paragliding|paragliders]], microlights, [[Autogyro|gyrocopters]], [[helicopters]], [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur built]] and mass-produced light aircraft, [[Warbird|ex-military aircraft]], and business jets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. i, para. 1}}</ref> Flights can be broadly categorised as public transport, aerial work, and private flying, the first two of which are commercial activities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. iii, paras. 13 & 16}}</ref>

===Commercial operations===

Commercial operations are remunerated activities which fall within the ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector.<ref name="BBGA_Industry"/><ref name="GAAC_Definition"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. iii, paras. 15<U+2013>16}}</ref> Public transport operations are non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than [[airline]] travel. [[Air taxi]] operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch.1, p. 5, paras. 1.25<U+2013>1.28}}</ref> An example of this type of operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British [[Formula One]] grand prix at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world<U+2019>s busiest airport.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ghkeurope.com/products/downloads/Publications/EIA_2002%20British_GP.pdf|title= The Economic Impact of the 2002 FIA Foster<U+2019>s British Grand Prix|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= Motorsport Industry Association|date= 2003-07|pages= p. 22, para. 5.7.2}}</ref> Aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as [[Aerial survey|surveying]], [[Aerial application|crop spraying]], and emergency services work ([[Air Ambulances in the United Kingdom|air ambulance]] and [[Police aviation in the United Kingdom|police]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch.1, p. 4, para. 1.21 & p. 5, para. 1.28}}</ref>

===Flying schools===

Flying schools are commercial businesses engaged in the [[Flight training|training of pilots]], both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for a significant amount of GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 9, para. 1.38}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 4, paras. 1.16<U+2013>1.17}}</ref> The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60<U+2013>70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70<U+2013>80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/ga/generalaviationlowres.pdf|title= Why General Aviation?|accessdate=2008-06-17 |publisher= General Aviation Awareness Council|pages= p. 8}} The publication is undated, but is reported in the July 2001 edition of [http://www.ebanmagazine.com/mag_full.html?ident=106 European Business Air News]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050524/debtext/50524-20.htm|title= House of Commons Hansard for 24 May 2005 (pt 20) |accessdate=2008-06-17 |publisher= [[Hansard]]|date= 2005-05-24|pages= column 618}}</ref> The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 7, p. 67, para. 7.21}}</ref> The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, p. 17, para. 2.18}}</ref> The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours "does not support such a gloomy outlook."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, p. 18, para. 2.24}}</ref>

===Private flying===

Private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport, using aircraft that are owned individually, collectively as part of a syndicate, or rented from a flying club. A survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that the most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near the base aerodrome, visits to other aerodromes, and day trips away.<ref name="GASAR_Activities">{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_NationalPilotSurvey.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - The National Pilot Survey|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-08|pages= p. 13}}</ref> Half of all flights landed at the same aerodrome they departed from, and only 9 per cent involved an overnight stay away from home.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_NationalPilotSurvey.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - The National Pilot Survey|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-08|pages= p. 11}}</ref>

Private flying is most associated with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the [[Cessna 152]], Cessna 172, and [[Piper Cherokee|Piper PA28 Cherokee]], all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of [[Cirrus Design|Cirrus]].<ref name="GA_Aircraft">{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 3, para. 1.15}}</ref> The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be <U+00A3>133, compared to an estimated <U+00A3>77 per hour for gliders, and a reported <U+00A3>35 per hour for microlights.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_NationalPilotSurvey.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - The National Pilot Survey|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-08|pages= p. 14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pilotweb.aero/content/articles/view_article.aspx?id=3345 |title= Flying microlights|accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher= [[Pilot Magazine UK|PilotWeb]] |Author= Dave Calderwood|date= 2005-04-11}}</ref> Recent trends have seen an increase in the use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the [[Robinson R22]] and [[Robinson R44|R44]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 7, para. 1.35 & p. 5, para. 1.29}}</ref> Another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the [[Van's Aircraft RV-4]] and the [[Rutan Long-EZ]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 8, para. 1.36}}</ref>

There is a strong vintage aircraft movement in the UK, with two-thirds of the 500 registered historic aircraft active. These cover the whole spectrum of civil and military aviation, examples being the [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]] airliner of the 1930s, and the [[World War II]] (WWII) [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighter. There are many post-WWII aircraft which could also be considered historic under a looser definition, including for example 60 ex-military jets such as the [[Hawker Hunter]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 5, para. 1.24 and footnote}}</ref> Historic aircraft are regular exhibits at [[Airshow|air displays]], which are claimed to be the second most popular spectator activity after football in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 6, para. 1.30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/ga/generalaviationlowres.pdf|title= Why General Aviation?|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= General Aviation Awareness Council|pages= p. 6}}</ref>

===Sports===

[[Image:Grid AstonDown.jpg|thumb|right|Gliders at the 2004 Standard Class Nationals race]]
[[Gliding competitions|Competetive gliding]] in the UK takes place between May and September. Regionals are local competitions, organised and run by one of the bigger gliding clubs in the region, and represent the entry level to glider racing. Races are handicapped according to glider performance, and normally take place over nine days. Success in the regionals allows pilots to progress to the nationals, where there are five [[Glider Competition Classes|classes]] of competition. These are based on glider performance, the lowest being club class, and then progressing through standard (maximum 15&nbsp;m [[wingspan]], and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] not permitted), 15&nbsp;m (as standard, but flaps are permitted), 18&nbsp;m (maximum 18&nbsp;m wingspan), and finally open-class (no restrictions). Success at national level can lead to a place in the national team and competition at international level.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lasham.org.uk/comps/introduction/competitions.asp|title= Gliding Competitions|accessdate=2008-07-31 |publisher= Lasham Gliding}}</ref> In 2007 the British gliding team was ranked number one, and British pilots took two women's [[World Gliding Championships|world championships]] and the open class [[European Gliding Championships|European championship]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.glidingteam.co.uk/|title= British Gliding Team website|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= British Gliding Team}}</ref>

{{See also|List of airports in the United Kingdom}}
''Aerodrome'' is a collective term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology can be used to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term ''[[airport]]'' to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and ''airfield'' to locations which predominantly support GA operations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, pp. 29<U+2013>30, paras. 3.36 & 3.45}}</ref> The ''General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study'' (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in [[England]] which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 2<U+2013>3}} Of the 687 aerodromes, 113 were used for glider, microlight, balloon and parascending operations which were nowhere described in detail, and could not therefore be included in the classification analysis, and 200 sites were identified as [[helipad]]s; a distinct category without further need for classification analysis according to the requirements of the study, leaving 374 which were included in the classification analysis.</ref><ref name="GASAR_Aerodrome_Qty"/>

===GASAR aerodrome classification===

The factors used in determining how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR study are based broadly on size and facilities. The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. [[East Midlands Airport|East Midlands]]); major GA airports (e.g. [[Oxford Airport|Oxford]]); developed GA airfields (e.g. [[Andrewsfield Airport|Andrewsfield]]); basic GA airfields (e.g. [[Rufforth]]); developed airstrips (e.g. [[Tilstock Airfield|Tilstock]]); and basic airstrips.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 2<U+2013>5}} The actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed up with a peer review by experienced GA pilots.</ref>

[[Image:Andrewsfield Airport from the air in 1991.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrewsfield Airport|Andrewsfield]] - classified by GASAR as a developed GA airfield]]
Airports generally have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full [[air traffic control]], and [[Radio navigation|navigation]] and [[Instrument approach|landing]] aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude certain types of light aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 5<U+2013>6}}</ref> At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 6<U+2013>8}}</ref> The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 8<U+2013>10}}</ref>

===Aerodrome licensing===

Most aerodromes used for public transport operations, and all those used for powered flight training operations, are required to be licensed by the CAA.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF|title= CAP 168 Licensing of Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2007-02-27|pages= p. 1, para. 2}}</ref> To be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy the CAA that: the physical conditions at the aerodrome, and its environs, are acceptable; the scale of equipment, and facilities provided, are adequate for the flying activities which are expected to take place; an effective safety management system is in place; and that staff are competent and, where necessary, suitably qualified.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF|title= CAP 168 Licensing of Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2007-02-27|pages= ch. 1, p. 6, para. 5.1}}</ref> Aerodromes classified as developed GA airfields or larger by the GASAR study are, with few exceptions, licensed. Only two basic GA airfields, [[Silverstone Heliport|Silverstone]] and [[Duxford Aerodrome|Duxford]], are licensed, and all airstrips are unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AerodromeCategorisation.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - Aerodrome Categorisation Using Secondary Aerodrome Data|accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2004-09|pages= pp. 5<U+2013>10}}</ref> The Light Aviation Airports Study Group, a joint CAA-industry initiative, was established in 2005 to review the regulation of light aviation aerodromes. A particular focus of this group was a review of the restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/17/srg_asd_laasgfinalreport_16-01-06.pdf|title= Final report to the CAA Executive Committee |accessdate=2008-07-23 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-01-16|pages= p. 1, para. 1.1}}</ref> The group concluded that the requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in the context of corresponding international and European requirements. It also recommended that restrictions on flight training at unlicensed aerodromes should be lifted, and a consultation to this effect was started in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/17/srg_asd_laasgfinalreport_16-01-06.pdf|title= Final report to the CAA Executive Committee |accessdate=2008-07-23 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-01-16|pages= p. 4, para. 5.6 & p. 5, para 9.1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1710/CL%2001-08%20-%20LAASG%20FTSG%20ANO%20Amendment%20Proposal%20-%20v%20%201.00.00%20-%2007%20Apr%2008.pdf|title= Consultation on The Light Aviation Airports Study Group (LAASG) FTSG Proposals |accessdate=2008-07-23 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008-04-07}}</ref>

==Scale of the sector==

[[Image:Hangglider103042006.jpg|thumb|right|There are 7,000 hang gliders registered in the UK]]
There are an estimated 27,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of which are engaged in GA activities. In 2005 the GA fleet comprised 9,000 fixed-wing aircraft, 4,100 microlights, 1,300 helicopters, 1,800 airships/balloons, 2,500 gliders and some 7,000 hang gliders. Estimates put the number of foreign-registered GA aircraft based in the UK at 900.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, pp. iii<U+2013>iv, paras. 17, 19 & 20}}</ref>

The number of pilots licensed by the CAA to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47,000, of whom 28,000 held a [[Private Pilot Licence]]. The remainder held professional pilot licences, either a [[Commercial Pilot Licence]] or an [[Airline Transport Pilot Licence]], although not all of these would be engaged in GA activities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. v, para. 24}}</ref> In addition, there are 10,000 active glider pilots,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gliding.co.uk/press/releases/2003/Gliding%20in%20UK.doc|title= Press Information|accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= [[British Gliding Association]]}}</ref> and estimates put the membership of aviation-related sport and recreational associations at 36,000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, p. 22, para. 2.37}}</ref> 

The number of aerodromes that support GA in the UK is difficult to establish with certainty.

The sector was estimated to employ nearly 12,000 people and directly contribute <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;billion to the UK economy in 2005, making it roughly seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the size of the CAT industry. Nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_GAsocio-economic_Rev1.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - An estimate of the annual direct socio-economic contribution of GA to the UK economy|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2006-03-25|pages= pp. 18<U+2013>19}}</ref>

==Trends==

[[Image:Piper.seneca.pa34.g-elis.bristol.arp.jpg|thumb|left|The number of registered twin piston-engined aircraft is on the decline.]]
Most sectors of GA for which data are available have experienced growth in aircraft numbers and hours flown over the last two decades. The lighter end of the GA spectrum: microlights, amateur built, and airships and balloons, have in particular shown strong growth, although the last of these activities was severely curtailed during the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth outbreak]] in 2001, when access to farmland was denied .<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 7<U+2013>8, paras. 1.34<U+2013>1.36}}</ref> After strong growth in the late 1980s, traditional flying has shown a slight decline recently, reflecting a move amongst recreational flyers towards microlight aircraft, and increased numbers of foreign-registered aircraft. Recreational helicopter usage has grown primarily due to the introduction of smaller and cheaper aircraft. Glider activity has remained relatively static, although there has been a gradual increase in the number of [[Motor glider|self-launching motor gliders]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 9 & 13<U+2013>14, paras. 1.37 & 1.46<U+2013>1.48}}</ref>

Business aviation has shown strong growth, although the numbers of aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from [[turboprop]] aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which are estimated to be growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 10<U+2013>12, paras. 1.40<U+2013>1.45}}</ref> The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 9<U+2013>10, paras. 1.38<U+2013>1.39}}</ref>

Since 1990 the total number of hours flown annually by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25<U+2013>1.35&nbsp;million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6&nbsp;million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has lead to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, pp. vi<U+2013>vii, paras. 30<U+2013>31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/gasar/GASAR_AnalysisHoursFlown.pdf |title= General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study - An analysis of CAA data regarding the number of GA aircraft and hours flown for the years 1984 to 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher= The Bartlett School, University College London|Author= Terry Lober|date= 2005-12|pages= p. 3}}</ref>

The objective of regulation is to "promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 4, p. 36, para. 4.7}}</ref> Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of [[airworthiness]], [[Pilot licensing in the United Kingdom|pilot qualification]], the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/RegReview.pdf|title= Regulatory Review of General Aviation in the United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07-06|pages= p. 4<U+2013>2}}</ref> The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972.<ref name="CAA_Start">{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/RegReview.pdf|title= Regulatory Review of General Aviation in the United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-03 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07-06|pages= pp. 4<U+2013>1 to 4<U+2013>2, para. 4.2}}</ref> In 1991 it started working within the [[Joint Aviation Authorities]] (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the [[European Union]] (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 5, pp. 52<U+2013>53, paras. 5.18<U+2013>5.24}}</ref> 

===Devolved and self-regulation===

Within this framework certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors that are not included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 1, para. 1.4}}</ref> The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association, although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the [[Popular Flying Association]]. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the [[British Parachute Association]], although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 2<U+2013>3, paras. 1.6<U+2013>1.10}}</ref> The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] UK, the [[British Gliding Association]], and the British Microlight Aircraft Association.<ref name="LASORS_NPPL">{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/175/Section%20C%20-%20PRIVATE%20PILOT%20LICENCE.pdf|title= Licensing, Administration and Standardisation; Operating Requirements and Safety (LASORS) - Section C Private Pilot Licence|accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008|pages= p. 20}}</ref> Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, p. 3, paras. 1.11<U+2013>1.13}}</ref>

===Airworthiness===

Under CAA and EASA rules, all aircraft are required to meet certain standards of airworthiness to fly safely and legally. Aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a Certificate of Airworthiness. However, British-registered aircraft which are excluded from the scope of EASA, and which cannot satisfy the requirements for the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness, may be issued with a Permit to Fly. This allows them to fly in UK airspace subject to certain limitations, for example being restricted to day-time flights under [[visual flight rules]] only. Permits are typically issued to vintage and historic aircraft, amateur built aircraft, and microlights.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP733.PDF|title= CAP 733 Permit to Fly Aircraft|accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2004-06-28|pages= ch. 1, pp. 1<U+2013>2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 1, pp. 2<U+2013>3, paras. 1.7<U+2013>1.9}}</ref>

The pilot qualification most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration.<ref name="LASORS_Remun">{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/175/Section%20A%20-%20GENERAL%20INFORMATION%20(LASORS).pdf|title= Licensing, Administration and Standardisation; Operating Requirements and Safety (LASORS) - Section A General Information|accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008|pages= p. 4}}</ref> In addition to the European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/175/Section%20C%20-%20PRIVATE%20PILOT%20LICENCE.pdf|title= Licensing, Administration and Standardisation; Operating Requirements and Safety (LASORS) - Section C Private Pilot Licence|accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008|pages= p. 1}}</ref> As a response to the perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aopa.co.uk/scripts/nppl.php|title= The National Private Pilot's Licence (NPPL)|accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher= [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] UK}}</ref> The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK airspace.<ref name="LASORS_NPPL"/> Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gliding.co.uk/bgainfo/nppl/futurelicensing.htm|title= Future Licensing|accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher= [[British Gliding Association]]}}</ref> the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect.

Between 1995 and 2004 there were 2,630 accidents involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, resulting in the loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small fixed-wing aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or [[airmanship]]; lack of training or experience; and omission of, or inappropriate, action.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP763.pdf|title= CAP 763 Aviation Safety Review 2005|accessdate=2008-06-21 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-08-08|pages= ch. 5, pp. 5<U+2013>6, para. 3.6}}</ref>

There were 27 fatal accidents involving GA aircraft in 2007, resulting in the loss of 48 lives. These compare with 16 accidents claiming a total of 19 lives the previous year, and although the 2007 statistics are higher than average, they are not exceptional.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/978/GeneralAviation.pdf|title= SRG Safety Plan 2008 Update|accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008-06|pages= p. 49}}</ref>

==Issues==

The growth in Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the operational freedom of GA, both in the air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulties with access to larger airports is compounded by a decline in the number of aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planning system]] is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3}}</ref>

===Access to airspace===

[[Image:Birmingham Airport, England, Feb. 2008.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Airspace_class#United_Kingdom|controlled airspace]] above [[Birmingham International Airport (United Kingdom)|Birmingham Airport]]]]
[[Airspace]] is shared by CAT, [[Military aviation|military]] and GA users. It is divided into [[controlled airspace]], in which aircraft must always be under the control of an [[air traffic controller]], and [[uncontrolled airspace]], in which aircraft can operate autonomously.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 23, para. 3.7}}</ref> Although GA flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace, they operate mainly outside of it.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 24, para. 3.9}}</ref> Controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of CAT, and mixing operations with other users is "considered undesirable, even untenable".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 26, para. 3.22}}</ref> Increases in the number of CAT operations, and in the number of airports they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in controlled airspace. Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and [[Wales]], leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where controlled airspace extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of controlled airspace there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, pp. 24<U+2013>25, paras. 3.13<U+2013>3.16}}</ref>

===Aerodrome access===

[[Image:Gatwick, 1960.jpg|thumb|right|Light aircraft parked at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1961, before it became a CAT giant]]
Regional airports, such as [[Southampton Airport]], have experienced strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, and although there is no evidence of unfair discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, pp. 29<U+2013>30, paras. 3.13<U+2013>3.16}}</ref>

In addition to this de facto loss of facilities, the number of aerodromes in the UK has been in decline over the last 50 years, as a result of increasing urbanisation and the rationalisation of WWII airfields. Alternative and more profitable uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with closure, for example [[North Weald Airfield|North Weald]], or actually being closed, as happened to [[Ipswich Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.northwealdairfield.org/Campaign/campaign.html|title= Campaign to Save North Weald Airfield|accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher= North Weald Airfield Users Group}} North Weald is waiting on a decision concerning closure and re-development for residential purposes.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ipswichairport.info/history.html|title= Ipswich Airport History|accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher= Ipswich Airport Association}} Ipswich Airport was closed in 1996 and the land turned over to residential re-development.</ref> Referring to the importance of a "functioning national network of GA airfields", especially where GA performs an air transport role, the CAA states that "there could be cause for concern if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue, especially if crucial nodes on the transport network were to be lost."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 33, para. 3.59 and p. 28, paras. 3.33 & 3.35}} 'Crucial nodes' are aerodromes for which "...there are no nearby alternatives...", and the loss of which "...may have a greater effect nationally, or in terms of regional economic development, than would be considered if only assessing the local effect."</ref>

===Planning system===

The planning system is critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 32, para. 3.49}}</ref> With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, pp. 18<U+2013>19, paras. 2.25<U+2013>2.27}}</ref> However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, pp. 33<U+2013>34, paras. 3.58<U+2013>3.61}}</ref> Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/20080229NoiseConsiderationsAtGAAerodromes-CAAGuidance.pdf|title= Noise Considerations at General Aviation (GA) Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-21 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2008-02-27|pages= ch. 3, pp. 1<U+2013>2, para. 3.2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/factsheets/GAAC-PPG24-report.pdf|title= A review of the application of Planning Policy Guidance Note PPG 24 to General Aviation airfields, with proposals for improved guidance|accessdate=2008-06-21 |publisher= General Aviation Awareness Council|date= 2002-12|pages= ch. 1, p. 2, para. 1.1}}</ref> GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to [[Local planning authority|Local Planning Authorities]], and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Appendix 6, p. 146, paras. 28<U+2013>29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gaac.co.uk/factsheets/GAAC-PPG24-report.pdf|title= A review of the application of Planning Policy Guidance Note PPG 24 to General Aviation airfields, with proposals for improved guidance|accessdate=2008-06-21 |publisher= General Aviation Awareness Council|date= 2002-12|pages= ch. 1, p. 2, paras. 1.2<U+2013>1.4}}</ref> [[Little Gransden Airfield|Little Gransden]] is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, p. 19}}</ref> Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 3, p. 33, paras. 3.56<U+2013>3.57}}</ref>

==Criticism==

[[Image:569897100 4e449041ab.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Parachute dropping is just one of the GA activities that generate noise complaints]]
Public opinion towards aviation generally is worsening, based on increasing [[Aviation and the environment|environmental concerns]] relating to emissions and [[Aircraft noise|noise]], and private flying has been criticised by respondents to a government consultation on aircraft noise as a frivolous or selfish activity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= Overview of the Strategic Review, p. iii, para. 15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/controlofnoisefromcivilaircr2877|title= Control of Noise from Civil Aircraft The Government<U+2019>s conclusions|accessdate=2008-06-23 |publisher= [[Department for Transport]]|date= 2003-12|pages= p. 6}}</ref> In terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to the CAA that relate specifically to GA, noise is "by far" the most common subject.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/20080229NoiseConsiderationsAtGAAerodromes-CAAGuidance.pdf|title= Noise Considerations at General Aviation (GA) Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-23 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= p. 1, para. 1.1}}</ref> Half of the 2,000 noise complaints made annually to the CAA concern GA operations, most of which relate to aerobatics, helicopters using private sites, air balloon incidents, parachute dropping, and alleged low flying.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1/strateg%20review.pdf|title= Strategic Review of General Aviation in the UK|accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|CAA]]|date= 2006-07|pages= ch. 2, p. 21, paras. 2.31<U+2013>2.34}}</ref>

Planning guidance on aircraft noise advises that "in some circumstances the public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/156558.pdf|title= Planning Policy Guidance 24: Planning and Noise|accessdate=2008-07-14 |publisher= Department for Communities and Local Government|date= 1994-09|pages= Annex 3, para. 7}}</ref> This is a result of the tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and the activities they are engaged in, including: repetitive [[Airfield traffic pattern|circuit flying]] at low-altitude near an aerodrome, during which aircraft are audible for long periods; slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around the [[drop zone]] or aerodrome, also audible for long periods; erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics; and piston-engines on full power in areas of low background noise, leading to the perception that such noise is more intrusive.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/20080229NoiseConsiderationsAtGAAerodromes-CAAGuidance.pdf |title= Noise Considerations at General Aviation (GA) Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]]|date= 2008-02-27|pages= p. 3, para. 5.1}}</ref> In an attempt to alleviate these problems, the majority of aerodromes implement noise abatement procedures designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas, and more than 50 are required by the government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/7/20080229NoiseConsiderationsAtGAAerodromes-CAAGuidance.pdf |title= Noise Considerations at General Aviation (GA) Aerodromes|accessdate=2008-06-14 |publisher= [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|CAA]]|date= 2008-02-27|pages= p. 3, section 6 and p. 8, para. 9.5}}</ref>
