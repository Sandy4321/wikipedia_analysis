'''Albert Baird Cummins''' (February 15, 1850{{spaced ndash}}July 30, 1926) was the [[List of Governors of Iowa|18th Governor of Iowa]], [[U.S. Senator]] and two-time presidential candidate. Cummins was perhaps the most influential leader in Iowa politics in the first quarter of the 20th century.  However, for many years he was a polarizing figure, leading the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Iowa Republican Party's]] progressive wing to power at the expense of its "old guard" of more conservative "standpatters" who had controlled the party almost since its inception. Shortly before his death, Cummins was defeated by an even more progressive adversary within his own party.

==Personal background==
Cummins was born in a log house in [[Carmichaels, Pennsylvania]] to Thomas L. Cummins, a carpenter/farmer, and Sarah Baird (Flenniken) Cummins.<ref name=biodict>John D. Buenker, "[http://uipress.lib.uiowa.edu/bdi/DetailsPage.aspx?id=83 Albert Baird Cummins]," in ''The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa'', p. 110 (2008).</ref> He lived in Pennsylvania until about 1869, and attended [[Greene Academy]].<ref name=kramme>Michael Kramme, "Governors of Iowa," 51-53 (The Iowan Books: 2006).</ref><ref name="arch">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = "National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania"| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H000659_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Greene Academy| accessdate = 2012-02-07| author = Charles Dunleavey| format = PDF| date= January 1976}}</ref> As a young man, he worked as a carpenter with his father.<ref name=kramme/> He attended country schools and completed a four-year course in two years at [[Waynesburg College]],<ref name=kramme/> but did not graduate because of a dispute with the College's president.<ref name=biodict/> After leaving the College, he initially was a tutor and taught at a country school.<ref name=kramme/>  

At age nineteen, Cummins came to Iowa, working in a county recorder's office in [[Elkader, Iowa]].<ref name=kramme/> He then became a civil engineer and helped to build railroads in Indiana.<ref name=kramme/>  After moving to Chicago, where he studied law, he was admitted to the bar in 1875.<ref name=kramme/>  After practicing law in Chicago for three years, he and his brother set up a practice in Des Moines.<ref name=kramme/> In his most famous case as an attorney, he represented a group of farmers in an attempt to break an eastern sydicate's control of the production of barbed wire.<ref name=kramme/> However, historians consider his representation of farmers in the barbed wire case to be an anomaly, because more often he represented corporations or businessmen.<ref name=biodict/> 

In 1887 Cummins was elected to a single term in the [[Iowa State Senate]] representing [[Des Moines]].  He was asked to serve as temporary chair of the 1892 State Republican Convention.<ref name=cole>Cyrenus Cole, "A History of the People of Iowa," p. 482, 486, 514-17, 520-23 (Torch Press, Cedar Rapids: 1921).</ref>  He unsuccessfully pursued a seat in the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1894.<ref name=cole/> In 1896 he was active in the [[William McKinley]] campaign, and was appointed as Iowa's representative on the [[Republican National Committee]].<ref name=cole/>

==1900 candidacies for U.S. Senate==
In 1900, Cummins was passed over twice for the U.S. Senate.  In early 1900, when the [[Iowa General Assembly]] exercised its former power to choose a U.S. Senator (for the Class 2 seat, to serve from 1901 to 1909), Cummins was the opponent of incumbent Republican [[John H. Gear]], but withdrew when it appeared he lacked the votes to win.<ref>"Our Des Moines Letter," Boyden Reporter, 1900-01-19 at 1.</ref>  After Gear suffered a fatal heart attack in July 1900, Governor [[Leslie M. Shaw]] rejected numerous appeals to appoint Cummins to the vacancy, and instead appointed [[Jonathan P. Dolliver]].<ref name=appoint>"Dolliver is Appointed," Des Moines Daily News, 1900-08-23 at 8.</ref> Cummins initially vowed to seek the seat again in the 1901 legislative session,<ref name=appoint/> but instead focused on winning the 1901 election for Governor of Iowa.

==Governor of Iowa==
Cummins served as [[Governor of Iowa]] between 1902 and 1908. He was the first Iowa governor elected to three successive terms.<ref name=kramme/> In the third election he won tight races for the Republican nomination against [[George D. Perkins]], editor of the [[Sioux City Journal]], and in the general election against Democrat [[Claude R. Porter]].<ref name=cole/>  While governor he led efforts to establish compulsory education, a state department of agriculture, and a system of primary elections.<ref name=kramme/>

Cummins became identified with an approach to tariff-setting known as "the Iowa idea."<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9802E4D91E3CE633A25755C1A9609C946396D6CF Cummins of Iowa, Builder of Railroads, Maker of Laws]," New York Times, 1912-06-16.</ref>  The <U+201C>Iowa idea,<U+201D> as stated in the Iowa Republican Party<U+2019>s 1902 platform, favored <U+201C>such amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act as will more fully carry out its prohibition of discrimination in ratemaking, and [such] modifications of the tariff schedules [as] may be required to prevent their affording a shelter to monopoly.<U+201D> <ref name=teddy>Edmund Morris, <U+201C>Theodore Rex: 1901-1909,<U+201D> p. 144 (2001), ISBN 0-394-55509-0.</ref>  The "idea" embodied the principle that tariff rates should accurately measure the difference between the cost of production here and abroad, but not set rates higher than necessary to protect home industries.<ref name=kramme/>

==U.S. Senator==
[[File:1509 16th Street, N.W..JPG|thumb|150px|Cummins' former residence in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In June 1908, Governor Cummins ran in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat held by [[William B. Allison]], who was seeking a record seventh term.<ref name=cole/>  Cummins was accused of breaking an earlier promise not to challenge Allison,<ref name=cole/> and lost by over 12,000 votes.<ref>"Allison Wins It!" The Iowa City Citizen, 1908-06-03 at p.1.</ref>  However, Senator Allison died August 4, 1908, two months after the primary and before the Iowa General Assembly chose among the primary winners.<ref>"Senator Allison Dies Suddenly at 2 P.M.," Waterloo Daily Courier, 1908-08-04, at p.1.</ref>  In November 1908 a second Republican primary was held, which Cummins won decisively.<ref>"Sweeping Victory for Cummins," Waterloo Daily Courier, 1908-11-04 at p.1.</ref> Later that month (and again two months later, in January 1909), Cummins was appointed by the Iowa General Assembly over democratic rival [[Claude R. Porter]].<ref>"Cummins Made Senator Today," Waterloo Daily Courier, 1908-11-24 at p.1; "Cummins Again Elected Senator, Waterloo Daily Courier, 1909-01-19 at p.1.</ref>  He served as a United States Senator from Iowa for 18 years, from 1908 until his death in 1926. He served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] between 1919 and 1925. He also chaired the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] and the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce]].

Cummins generally supported President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s initiatives to regulate business, and authored a clause of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref name=biodict/>  Although Cummins voted in favor of the 1917 declaration of war against the [[German Empire]] when Wilson requested it, he sided most often with his party than with Wilson on other foreign-policy issues, opposing the arming of merchant ships in early 1917 and U.S. membership in a [[League of Nations]] in 1919-20.<ref name=biodict/>  

It was as Interstate Commerce Committee chair that Cummins sponsored the [[Esch-Cummins Act]] of 1920, establishing the conditions for the return of the railroads to private control after their government operation during [[World War I]].<ref name=cole/> Labor activists complained that the bill perpetuated harsh limits on collective bargaining, including provisions making it a crime to encourage a railroad strike, in the absence of a wartime emergency.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0DE4DA1038EE32A2575AC1A9669D946896D6CF Wider Strike Ban in Cummins Bill]," New York Times, 1919-10-19 at p.3.</ref> It symbolized Cummins' postwar break with the  progressive movement, which would ultimately contribute to his defeat.

==Pursuit of the presidency==
In January 1912, Cummins announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D00EFD9123AE633A25752C2A9679C946396D6CF Cummins Openly After the Presidency]," New York Times, 1912-01-21 at p.2.</ref> He was a candidate through the Republican National Convention in Chicago in June 1912. During the turmoil of the convention and the walkout of [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore Roosevelt's]] supporters, Cummins' name was not placed into nomination.<ref>"Cummins' Name Not Given to Convention as Iowa's Name is Called by the Chair," Des Moines Daily News, 1912-06-23 at p.3.</ref> In the general election, Cummins supported Roosevelt rather than Taft, even though he opposed Roosevelt's creation of a third party.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A04E1D9123CE633A25757C0A96F9C946396D6CF Cummins for Roosevelt]," New York Times, 1912-09-04 at p.3.</ref> 

In 1916 Cummins again ran for the Republican nomination for president.  This time, with no incumbent president of his own party, delegates were split among over a dozen candidates on the first ballot (on which Cummins finished fifth).  After Cummins again finished fifth on the second ballot, he released his delegates, contributing to the third-ballot victory of Supreme Court Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]].<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9900E3DC113CE733A25752C1A9609C946796D6CF Hitchcock Triumph Over the Old Guard]," New York Times, 1916-06-11 at p.1.</ref>

==Defeat and death==
In June 1926, insurgent [[Smith W. Brookhart]] defeated Cummins in the Republican primary for Cummins' Senate seat.  Two months earlier, Brookhart had been removed from the Iowa's other U.S. Senate seat when a majority of his colleagues in the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted in favor of Democrat Dan Steck's challenge to the outcome of the 1924 Brookhart-Steck race. Cummins had refused to take a position on the election contest, knowing that if Brookhart were unseated he would likely run for Cummins' seat.<ref>"Cummins Asks to be Excused from Voting in the Brookhart Contest," Davenport Democrat and Leader, 1926-04-01 at p.1.</ref>

The month after his primary defeat, Cummins died in [[Des Moines]]. He is buried at the Woodland Cemetery there.
