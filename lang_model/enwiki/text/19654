{{otheruses|Percival (disambiguation)}}
{{Wagner operas}}'''''Parsifal''''' is an [[opera]], or [[music drama]], in three acts by [[Richard Wagner]]. It is loosely based on [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]'', the [[medieval]] (13th century) [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] of the [[Arthurian]] knight Parzival ([[Percival]]) and his quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. 

During the first [[Act (theater)|Act]], Parsifal, an apparently witless [[fool]], sees the suffering of the wounded Amfortas, [[King]] of an order of [[knights]] who guard the Grail. In the second Act Parsifal wanders into the domain of Klingsor, a [[magician]] who is trying to corrupt the Knights of the Grail and who has stolen from them the [[Holy Lance|spear]] used to pierce [[Jesus Christ]] during his [[crucifixion]]. There Parsifal meets Kundry, the [[slave]] of Klingsor, who attempts to [[seduce]] him. In resisting her, he destroys Klingsor, and recovers the Spear. In the third Act, Parsifal returns to the Grail Kingdom to heal Amfortas. 

[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] first conceived the work in April [[1857]] but it was not finished until twenty-five years later. It was to be Wagner's last completed opera and in composing it he took advantage of the particular [[sonority]] of his [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]. Parsifal was first produced at the second [[Bayreuth Festival]] in [[1882]]. The Bayreuth Festival maintained an exclusive monopoly on Parsifal productions until 1903, when the opera was performed at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York]]. 

Wagner preferred to describe Parsifal not as an opera, but as "ein B<U+00FC>hnenweihfestspiel" - "A Festival Play for the Consecration of the Stage". At Bayreuth a tradition has arisen that there is no applause after the first act of the opera.

==Composition==
Wagner first read [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s poem ''Parzival'' while [[Spa town|taking the waters]] at [[Mari<U+00E1>nsk<U+00E9> L<U+00E1>zn<U+011B>|Marienbad]] in [[1845]].<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983) "Richard Wagner: his life, his work, his Century." William Collins, ISBN 0-00-216669-0 p141</ref> After encountering [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s work in [[1854]], Wagner became interested in oriental philosophies, especially [[Buddhism]]. He was particularly inspired by reading [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Burnouf]]'s ''"Introduction <U+00E0> l'histoire du buddhisme indien"'' in 1855/56. Out of this interest came ''"Die Sieger"'' ("The Victors", [[1856]]) a sketch Wagner wrote for an opera based on a story from the life of [[Buddha]].<ref>Hollinrake, Roger (1992) in "The Wagner Compendium: A Guide to Wagner's Life and Music". Ed. Millington. Thames and Hudson Ltd., London. ISBN 0-02-871359-1 page 147</ref> The themes which were later explored in Parsifal of self-renouncing, reincarnation, compassion and even exclusive social groups ([[castes]] in ''Die Sieger'', the Knights of the Grail in Parsifal) were first introduced in ''"Die Sieger"''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.c2i.net/monsalvat/sieger.htm | title = "Die Sieger" at Derrick Everett's Parsifal site "Monsalvat" | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>.

According to his own account, recorded in his autobiography ''Mein Leben'', Wagner conceived ''Parsifal'' on [[Good Friday]] morning, April [[1857]], in the ''Asyl'' (German: "Asylum"), the small cottage on [[Otto Wesendonck|Otto von Wesendonck<U+2019>s]] estate in the [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] suburb of Enge, which Wesendonck - a wealthy silk merchant and generous patron of the arts - had placed at Wagner<U+2019>s disposal.<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983) ''ibid'' p270</ref> The composer and his wife [[Minna Planer|Minna]] had moved into the cottage on [[28 April]]:

{{quotation|
"... on [[Good Friday]] I awoke to find the sun shining brightly for the first time in this house: the little garden was radiant with green, the birds sang, and at last I could sit on the roof and enjoy the long-yearned-for peace with its message of promise. Full of this sentiment, I suddenly remembered that the day was Good Friday, and I called to mind the significance this omen had already once assumed for me when I was reading [[Wolfram von Eschenbach|Wolfram]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. Since the sojourn in [[Marienbad]] [in the summer of [[1845]]], where I had conceived ''[[Die Meistersinger von N<U+00FC>rnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', I had never occupied myself again with that poem; now its noble possibilities struck me with overwhelming force, and out of my thoughts about Good Friday I rapidly conceived a whole drama, of which I made a rough sketch with a few dashes of the pen, dividing the whole into three acts." <ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/wglf210.txt | title = Wagner, Richard "Mein Leben" vol II at Project Gutenberg | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>}}

However, as he later admitted to his second wife [[Cosima Wagner]], this account had been coloured by a certain amount of poetic licence:

{{quotation|
[[22 April]] [[1879]]: "R[ichard] today recalled the impression which inspired his <U+201C>Good Friday Music<U+201D>; he laughs, saying he had thought to himself, <U+201C>In fact it is all as far-fetched as my love affairs, for it was not a Good Friday at all - just a pleasant mood in Nature which made me think, <U+2018>This is how a Good Friday ought to be<U+2019><U+201D>. <ref>Wagner, Cosima (1980) "Cosima Wagner's Diaries" tr. Skelton, Geoffrey. Collins. ISBN:0-00-216189-3</ref>
}}

The work may indeed have been conceived at Wesendonck's cottage in the last week of April [[1857]], but Good Friday that year fell on [[10 April]], when the Wagners were still living at Zeltweg 13 in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]].<ref>Millington, Barry (Ed.) (1992). The Wagner Compendium: A Guide to Wagner's Life and Music. Thames and Hudson Ltd., London. ISBN 0-02-871359-1 pages 135-136.</ref> If the prose sketch which Wagner mentions in ''Mein Leben'' was accurately dated (and most of Wagner<U+2019>s surviving papers are dated), it could settle the issue once and for all, but unfortunately it has not survived.

Wagner did not resume work on ''Parsifal'' for eight years, during which time he completed ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' and began ''[[Die Meistersinger von N<U+00FC>rnberg|Die Meistersinger]]''. Then, between 27 and [[30 August]] [[1865]], he took up ''Parsifal'' again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and a considerable amount of detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. <ref>Beckett, Lucy (1981) "Richard Wagner: Parsifal", Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29662-5, page 13.</ref> But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner<U+2019>s creative energy was devoted to the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle, which was finally completed in [[1874]] and given its first full performance at [[Bayreuth]] in August [[1876]]. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on ''Parsifal''. By [[23 February]] [[1877]] he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by [[19 April]] of the same year he had transformed this into a verse [[libretto]] (or <U+201C>poem<U+201D>, as Wagner liked to call his [[Libretto|libretti]]).<ref>Beckett, Lucy (1981) ''ibid'' page 22.</ref>

In September [[1877]] he began the music by making two complete drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the ''Gesamtentwurf'' and in English as either the ''Preliminary Draft'' or the ''First Complete Draft'') was made in pencil on three [[Staff (music)|staves]], one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft (''Orchesterskizze'', ''Orchestral Draft'', ''Short Score'' or ''Particell'') was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.<ref>Millington, Barry (Ed.) (1992)''ibid'' pages 247-148.</ref>

The second draft was begun on [[25 September]] [[1877]], just a few days after the first: at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, switching back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The ''Gesamtentwurf'' of Act III was completed on [[16 April]] [[1879]] and the ''Orchesterskizze'' on the 26th of the same month.<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983)''ibid'' pages 477-479</ref>

The full score (''Partiturerstschrift'') was the final stage in the compositional process. It was made in ink and consisted of a fair copy of the entire opera, with all the voices and instruments properly notated according to standard practice.

Wagner composed ''Parsifal'' one act at a time, completing the ''Gesamtentwurf'' and ''Orchesterskizze'' of each act before beginning the ''Gesamtentwurf'' of the next act; but because the ''Orchesterskizze'' already embodied all the compositional details of the full score, the actual drafting of the ''Partiturerstschrift'' was regarded by Wagner as little more than a routine task which could be done whenever he found the time. The Prelude of Act I was scored in August [[1878]]. The rest of the opera was scored between August [[1879]] and [[13 January]] [[1882]].<ref>Millington, Barry (Ed.) (1992)''ibid'' page 307.</ref>

[[Image:Parsifal-affisch.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Poster for the premier production of ''Parsifal'' - 1882]]
====The Premiere====
On [[12 November]] [[1880]] Wagner conducted a private performance of the Prelude for his patron [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] at the Court Theatre in [[Munich]].<ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983)''ibid'' page 485.</ref> The premiere of the entire work was given in the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Festspielhaus]] at [[Bayreuth]] on [[26 July]] [[1882]] under the baton of the German-born Jewish conductor [[Hermann Levi]]. Stage designs were by [[Max Br<U+00FC>ckner]] and [[Paul von Joukowsky]] who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall was based on the interior of [[Siena Cathedral]] which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor's magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in [[Ravello]]. <ref> Beckett, Lucy (1981)''ibid'' pages 90 - 91.</ref> In July and August of 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in [[Bayreuth]] conducted by Levi and [[Franz Fischer (musician)|Franz Fischer]]. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, a chorus of 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast).<ref>Carnegy, Patrick (2006) "Wagner and the Art of the the Theatre". Yale University Press ISBN 0-300-10695-5. Pages 107 - 118.</ref>  At the last of these performances, Wagner took the baton from Levi and conducted the final scene of Act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.<ref> Spencer, Stewart (2000) ''Wagner Remembered''. Faber and Faber, London. ISBN 0-571-19653-5. Page 270.</ref>

At the first performances of ''Parsifal'' problems with the moving scenery during the transition from Scene one to Scene two in Act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. [[Engelbert Humperdinck]], who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. <ref> Spencer, Stewart (2000) ''ibid'' Pages 268 - 270.</ref> In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.

====The ban on Parsifal outside Bayreuth====
For the first twenty years of its existence, the only staged performances of ''Parsifal'' (apart from eight private performances for [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] at Munich in [[1884]] and [[1885]]) took place in the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]], the venue for which Wagner conceived the work. Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep 'Parsifal' exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent 'Parsifal' from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him - a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly he thought that 'Parsifal' would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance. 

The Bayreuth authorities allowed unstaged performances to take place in various countries after Wagner's death (e.g. [[London]] in [[1884]], [[New York]] in 1886, and [[Amsterdam]] in [[1894]]) but they maintained an embargo on stage performances outside Bayreuth. On [[24 December]] [[1903]], after receiving a court ruling that performances in the [[United States|USA]] could not be prevented by Bayreuth, the [[New York]] [[Metropolitan Opera]] staged the complete opera, using many Bayreuth-trained singers, much to the chagrin of Wagner's family. Unauthorized stage performances were also undertaken in Amsterdam in [[1905]], [[1906]] and [[1908]]. In [[1913]], Wagner's centenary year, Bayreuth's monopoly on the work was finally broken and since then the work has been freely staged throughout the world. <ref> Beckett, Lucy (1981)''ibid'' pages 93 - 95.</ref>The first authorized performance was mounted in [[Gran Teatre del Liceu|Barcelona]]: it began one hour before midnight on December 31 1912, taking advantage of the one hour [[time zone|time difference]] which existed at that time between Barcelona and Bayreuth. Such was the demand for Parsifal that it was presented in more than 50 European opera houses between January 1st and August 1st 1914.<ref> Beckett, Lucy (1981)''ibid'' page 94.</ref>

====Applause during Parsifal====
At Bayreuth performances audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act.  This tradition is the result of a misunderstanding arising from Wagner's desire at the [[premiere]] to maintain the serious mood of the opera. After much applause following the first and second acts, Wagner spoke to the audience and said that the cast would take no [[curtain call]]s until the end of the performance. This confused the audience, who remained silent at the end of the opera until Wagner addressed them again, saying that he did not mean that they could not applaud. After the performance Wagner complained "Now I don't know. Did the audience like it or not?" <ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983)''ibid'' p506</ref> At following performances some believed that Wagner had wanted no applause until the very end, and there was silence after the first two acts. Eventually it became a Bayreuth tradition that no applause would be heard after the first act, however this was certainly not Wagner's idea. In fact during the first Bayreuth performances Wagner himself cried "Bravo!" as the Flower-maidens made their exit in the Second Act, only to be hissed by other members of the audience. <ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983)''ibid'' p506</ref> At theatres other than Bayreuth, applause and curtain-calls is normal practise after every act.

====Post-War Performances====
Parsifal is one of the Wagner operas regularly presented at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to this day. Among the more significant post-war productions was that  directed in 1951 by [[Wieland Wagner]], the composer's grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after [[World War 2]]  he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the Hall of the Grail or the Flower-Maiden's bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner's music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the [[Swiss]] stage designer, [[Adolphe Appia]]. The reaction to this production was extreme: [[Ernest Newman]], Wagner's biographer described it as "not only the best Parsifal I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life".<ref> Spotts, Frederic (1994). ''"Bayreuth: A History of the Wagner Festival."'' New Haven and London: Yale University Press ISBN :0-300-05777-6. page 212.</ref> Others were appalled that Wagner's stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the [[dress rehearsal]] he imagined that the stage decorations were still to come.<ref>Carnegy, Patrick (2006) ''ibid'' pages 288-290.</ref> Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the [[Peace_symbol#Dove_and_olive_branch| dove]] which appears over Parsifal's head at the end of the opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the length of the string sufficient so that the conductor could see the dove, but the audience could not. <ref>{{cite cd notes |first=Andreas |last=Kluge |title=Parsifal 1951 |date=1992 |cddesc=Wagner: Parsifal |publisher=Teldec |catalognumber=9031-76047-2}}</ref> Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966.

==Synopsis==

Place: [[Spain]], the castle of [[Monsalvat]] and Klingsor's magic palace.

===Act I===
====Scene One====

In a wood near the castle of Monsalvat, home to the [[Knight]]s of the Grail, Gurnemanz, one of the Knights of the [[Grail]], wakes his young [[squire]]s and leads them in prayer. He notices the retinue of Amfortas approach, and asks the leading Knight for news of the King<U+2019>s health. The knight tells him that the [[King]] has suffered during the night and is going early for his bath. The squires ask Gurnemanz to explain how the King<U+2019>s injuries can be healed, but before he can do so a wild woman <U+2013> Kundry - bursts in.  She gives Gurnemanz balsam, brought from [[Arabia]], to ease the King<U+2019>s pain and then collapses, exhausted. 
[[Image:Hermann Hendrich Parsifal.jpg|right|thumb|''Parsifal'' by [[Hermann Hendrich]]]]
Amfortas, King of the Grail Knights, arrives, carried on a [[stretcher]]. He asks for Gawain, only to be told that this Knight has left without his permission. Angrily, Amfortas says that this sort of impetuousity was what led him to Klingsor<U+2019>s realm and to his downfall. He receives Kundry<U+2019>s potion and tries to thank her, but she answers, incoherently, that thanks will not help and urges him to his bath. 

The King leaves, and the squires question Kundry mistrustfully. Gurnemanz tells them that Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights but that she appears and disappears at her whim. When he himself asks why she does not stay to help, she replies that she never helps. The squires think she is a [[witch]] and sneer that if she is so helpful, why does she not find the [[Holy Lance|Holy Spear]] for them? Gurnemanz says that this is destined to be the job of another. He tells them that Amfortas had been the guardian of the Spear, but lost hold of it as he was being seduced by a fearsomely attractive woman in Klingsor<U+2019>s domain. Klingsor had then grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas: this is the [[wound]] which causes Amfortas<U+2019> suffering and it is said that it will never heal by itself.

Two squires, returning from the King<U+2019>s [[bathing|bath]], tell Gurnemanz that Kundry<U+2019>s [[balsam]] has eased the King<U+2019>s sufferings for the moment. His squires ask Gurnemanz whether he knew Klingsor. He tells them of how the Holy Spear, which was used to wound the Redeemer on the Cross, and the Grail which caught His [[blood]], had come to Monsalvat to be guarded by the Knights of the Grail under the rule of Titurel <U+2013> Amfortas<U+2019> father. Klingsor had yearned to join the Knights, but had been unable to drive impure thoughts from his mind and resorted to [[self-castration]] which led to his expulsion. Klingsor then bitterly set himself up in opposition to the Kingdom of the Grail, learning dark arts and establishing a domain full of beautiful flower-maidens who seduce and destroy the Knights of the Grail. It was in this way that Amfortas lost the Holy Spear, which is now in Klingsor<U+2019>s hand. Gurnemanz relates how Amfortas then had a vision in which he was told to wait for a <U+201C>[[purity|pure]] [[fool]], [[Enlightenment (concept)|enlightened]] by [[compassion]]<U+201D> (''<U+201C>Durch Mitleid wissend, der reine Tor<U+201D>'') who would finally heal his wound.

Just at this moment, cries are heard from the Knights: a flying [[swan]] has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] in his hand and carrying a quiver of matching arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad and tells him that this is a holy domain and then asks the boy what harm had the swan ever done to him. Gurnemanz gets the lad to notice the now lifeless remains of the swan and lack of life in the swan's eye. Remorseful, the boy now breaks his self-made bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks the boy to say why he is here, who his father is, how he arrived at the realm of the Grail, and what his name is. To each question the boy replies, "I don't know."  When asked what he does know, the boy says he has a mother called Herzeleide, and that he made his bow himself. Kundry has been watching and now she tells them that the boy<U+2019>s father was Gamuret, a knight killed in [[battle]], and how the boy<U+2019>s mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would suffer the same fate as his father. The boy exclaims that after seeing Knights passing through his forest he immediately left his mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the boy that his mother has died of grief, at which the boy attempts to attack Kundry, but then collapses in [[grief]]. Kundry suddenly seems overcome with [[sleep]], but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she would never waken. She crawls off to rest.

Gurnemanz knows that only the pious are led by the Grail to Monsalvat and thus takes the boy to observe the Grail [[ritual]]. The boy does not know what the Grail is, but remarks as they walk that although he scarcely moves, he has travelled far. Gurnemanz tells him that in this realm, time becomes space. An orchestral interlude leads to Scene Two.

====Scene Two====

They arrive at the Hall of the Grail, where the Knights are assembling to receive [[Holy Communion]].  The voice of Titurel is heard, telling his son, Amfortas, to uncover the Grail. Amfortas is racked with shame and suffering (''" Wehvolles Erbe, dem ich verfallen"''). He is the Guardian of the Grail, and yet he has succumbed to temptation and lost the Holy Spear: he declares himself unworthy of his office. He cries out for [[forgiveness]] (''<U+201C>Erbarmen!<U+201D>'') but hears only the [[promise]] of future [[redemption]] by the [[purity|pure]] fool. On hearing Amfortas' cry, the boy appears to suffer with him, clutching at his heart. The Knights and Titurel urge Amfortas to reveal the Grail, which he finally does. The Hall is bathed in the light of the Grail as the Knights commune.  Gurnemanz motions to the boy to participate, but he, entranced, does not notice.  Amfortas does not commune, and as the [[ceremony]] ends, he collapses in pain and is taken out. Slowly the [[Hall]] empties leaving only the boy and Gurnemanz, who asks him if he has understood what he has seen. The boy cannot answer and is roughly ejected by Gurnemanz with a warning not to shoot swans. A [[voice]] from [[heaven]] repeats the promise, <U+201C>The pure fool, enlightened by compassion."

===Act II===
====Scene One====
The second act begins in Klingsor<U+2019>s magic [[castle]], where Klingsor calls up his  servant to destroy this foolish boy who has found his way to Klingsor's domain (''" Die Zeit ist da"''). He names her: [[Herodias]], Gundryggia and finally Kundry. She is again transformed into the incredibly alluring woman who had seduced Amfortas. She wakes from her sleep and resists Klingsor. As he claims power over her, she mocks his enforced [[chastity]], and that casts Klingsor into self-reproach but soon after that, Kundry succumbs to her own curse. Klingsor calls up Knights from his domain to attack the boy, but can only watch as they are wounded and beaten back. He sees the boy stray into his Flowermaiden garden and calls on Kundry to seek the boy out <U+2013> but she has already gone.
[[Image:Parsifal-kitsch.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Parsifal postcard around 1900 - unknown artist]]

====Scene Two====
The boy finds himself in a [[Garden]] surrounded by the beautiful and seductive Flower-maidens. They call to him and entwine themselves around him, chiding him for wounding their lovers and for resisting their charms (''" Komm, komm, holder Knabe!"''). They fight amongst themselves to win his love but are stilled when a voice calls out, "Parsifal!"  The boy suddenly remembers that this is the name his mother used when she appeared in his dreams. The Flower-maidens recoil from him and call him a fool, leaving Parsifal and Kundry alone. He wonders if this has all been a [[dream]] and asks how she knows his name. Kundry tells him that she knows his name from his Mother who had loved him and tried to protect him from his father<U+2019>s fate, but who he abandoned and who finally died of [[grief]] (''" Ich sah das Kind am seiner Mutter Brust."'') Parsifal is overcome with [[remorse]] and blames himself for his mother<U+2019>s death. He thinks he must be very stupid to have forgotten his mother. Kundry says that this is his first sign of understanding, and that she can help him understand his mother<U+2019>s love by kissing him.  As they [[kiss]], Parsifal recoils in pain and cries out for Amfortas: Parsifal feels Amfortas's wound burning in his side, and now understands Amfortas<U+2019> passion during the Grail Ceremony (''" Amfortas! Die Wunde! Die Wunde!"'') Filled with this [[compassion]] for Amfortas, Parsifal rejects Kundry.

Furious, Kundry tells Parsifal that if he can feel compassion for Amfortas, then he must feel compassion for her as well.  She has been [[Wandering Jew|cursed for centuries]], unable to rest, because she saw the [[Jesus Christ|Savior]] on the cross and [[schadenfreude|laughed]].  Now she can never weep, only laugh, and though she seems to be the [[slave]] of the Spear-carrier, due to her curse, she lives only to seduce.  He rejects her again and asks her to lead him to Amfortas.  She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will lead him to Amfortas.  When he refuses again, she curses him to wander without ever returning to the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally she calls on Klingsor to help her. 

Klingsor appears and throws the Spear at Parsifal, which stops in midair over his head.  Parsifal seizes it and makes the sign of the [[Christian Cross|Cross]], and the castle crumbles.  As he leaves, he tells Kundry that she knows where she can find him again.

===Act III===
====Scene One====
[[Image:Stassen Grail.jpg|right|thumb|"Parsifal revealing the Holy Grail" by Franz Stassen (1869-1949) from ''Parsifal: A Drama by Wagner Retold by Oliver Huckel'' (Crowell, New York, 1903)]]

The Third act opens again at the Kingdom of the Grail, many years later. Gurnemanz, now aged and bent, hears a crying outside his hut and discovers Kundry unconscious. He revives her, using water from the Holy [[Spring (hydrosphere)|Spring]], but she will only speak the word <U+201C>serve<U+201D> (<U+201C>Dienen<U+201D>). Gurnemanz wonders if there is any significance in the fact that she has reappeared on this special day. He then notices a figure dressed in full [[armour]] approaching. He cannot see who it is because the stranger wears a helmet, and does not speak. Finally the apparition removes its helmet and Gurnemanz recognises the boy who shot the swan, and then realises that the spear carried by him is the Holy Spear.

Parsifal tells of his desire to return to Amfortas (''" Zu ihm, des tiefe Klagen."'') He relates his journey, wandering for years unable to find the path back to the Grail: he has often been forced to fight, but has never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse preventing Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, but that in his absence Amfortas has refused to reveal the Grail, and that Titurel has died. Parsifal is overcome with [[remorse]], blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel<U+2019>s [[funeral]] rites, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal<U+2019>s feet and Gurnemanz [[anoint]]s him with water from the Holy Spring, recognising him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.

Parsifal comments on the beauty of the meadow and Gurnemanz explains that today is [[Good Friday]], when all the world is renewed. Parsifal baptizes the weeping Kundry. A short orchestral interlude leads into Scene Two.

====Scene Two====
Once more they travel to the Hall of the Grail. Amfortas is brought before the Grail and before Titurel<U+2019>s [[coffin]]. He cries out to his dead father to offer him rest from his sufferings, and wishes to join him in death (''" Mein vater!Hochgesegneter der Helden!"'') The Knights of Grail urge Amfortas angrily to reveal the Grail to them again, but Amfortas in a frenzy says he will never reveal the Grail and commands his Knights to kill him. At this moment, Parsifal arrives and says that only one weapon can perform this task (''" Nur eine Waffe taugt"''): with the Spear he heals Amfortas<U+2019> wound and forgives him. He commands the  revealing of the Grail. All kneel while Kundry, released from her [[curse]], sinks lifeless to the ground while a [[Peace_symbol#Dove_and_olive_branch|white dove]] descends to hover over the head of Parsifal.

==Criticism and Influence==
As Wagner's last opera, Parsifal has been both influential and controversial. The use of Christian symbols in Parsifal (the Grail, the Spear, references to the Redeemer) have sometimes led to it being regarded almost as a religious rite. It should be noted, however, that Wagner never actually refers to [[Jesus Christ]] by name in the opera, preferring instead to refer to ''"The Redeemer"''. In his essay ''"Religion and Art"'' Wagner himself described the use of Christian imagery thus: {{quotation|"When religion becomes artificial, art has a duty to rescue it. Art can show that the symbols which religions would have us believe literally true are actually figurative. Art can idealize those symbols, and so reveal the profound truths they contain."<ref> {{cite web | url = http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wlpr0126.htm | title = Wagner, Richard (1880) ''"Religion and Art."'' English translation | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>}}
===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who was originally one of Wagner's champions, chose to use ''Parsifal'' as the grounds for his breach with Wagner. In ''"[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]"'' he wrote: {{quotation|"Parsifal is a work of perfidy, of vindictiveness, of a secret attempt to poison the presuppositions of life - a bad work. The preaching of chastity remains an incitement to anti-nature: I despise everyone who does not experience Parsifal as an attempted assassination of basic ethics."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/ncw.htm | title = Nietzsche, Friedrich (1888) ''"Nietszche contra Wagner."'' English translation | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>}} Despite this attack on the subject matter, he also admitted that the music was sublime: "Has Wagner ever written anything better?" (Letter to [[Heinrich K<U+00F6>selitz|Peter Gast]], 1887).  [[Claude Debussy]], who was in later years very critical of Wagner and his influence, called it "one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music". [[Gustav Mahler]], who attended the premiere, stated afterwards: "When I came out of the Festspielhaus, unable to speak a word, I knew that I had experienced supreme greatness and supreme suffering, and that this experience, hallowed and unsullied, would stay with me for the rest of my life". Parsifal was a major source of inspiration for [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem "[[The Waste Land]]", and also adapted for the screen (in a highly controversial fashion) by director [[Hans-J<U+00FC>rgen Syberberg]].

===Gobineau===
Some writers see in the opera the promotion of [[racism]] and [[anti-semitism]] <ref> Gutman, Robert (1968, revised 1990). "Richard Wagner : The Man, His Mind and His Music". Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ISBN 0-14-021168-3 pbk (1971), 015677615 4 pbk (1990)</ref><ref>See [[Wagner Controversies]] for more detail on Aryanism and Parsifal</ref> suggesting that Parsifal was written in support of the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] who advocated [[Aryanism]]. Parsifal is proposed as the "pure-blooded" (''ie'' [[Aryan Race|Aryan]]) hero who overcomes Klingsor, who is perceived as a Jewish stereotype, particularly since he opposes the quasi-Christian Knights of the Grail. Such claims remain heavily debated,<ref>Borchmeyer, Dieter (2003). "Drama and the World of Richard Wagner", Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-11497-8</ref><ref>Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983)''Ibid'' p 477 ff.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.c2i.net/monsalvat/racism.htm | title = Parsifal and racism considered at Derrick Everett's Parsifal site "Monsalvat" | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref> since there is nothing explicit in the libretto to support them, and Cosima Wagner's diaries, which relate in great detail Wagner's thoughts over the last 14 years of his life (including the period covering the composition and first performance of Parsifal) never mention any such intention. Wagner first met Gobineau very briefly in 1876, but he only read Gobineau's ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''<ref> Gutman (1990), ''ibid'', page 406</ref> in 1880. However, Wagner had completed the libretto for Parsifal by [[1877]], and the original drafts of the story date back to [[1857]]. Despite this lack of chronology, Gobineau is frequently cited as a major inspiration for Parsifal.<ref> Adorno, Theodor (2005). "In Search of Wagner". Verso ISBN 1-84-467500-9 pbk</ref>

If Parsifal so clearly expressed the concept of [[Aryan Race|Aryan]] supremacy then it would doubtless have been popular with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party in 20th Century [[Germany]]. In fact, the Nazis placed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on performances of Parsifal because of its "pacifist undertones".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://home.c2i.net/monsalvat/banned.htm | title = The Ban on Parsifal at Derrick Everett's Parsifal site "Monsalvat" | accessdate = October 8 | accessyear = 2007}}</ref>

===Schopenhauer===
Other writers (particularly [[Bryan Magee]]) <ref>Magee, Bryan (2002). The Tristan Chord. Owl Books, NY. ISBN 0-8050-7189-X. (UK Title: Wagner and Philosophy, Publisher Penguin Books Ltd, ISBN 0-14-029519-4)</ref> see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhaurian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows [[compassion]], which [[Schopenhauer]] saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion in the face of enormous sexual temptation (Act 2 scene 3). Once again, Schopenhaurian philosophy suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]], and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on "Mitleid" (compassion) is a natural follow-on to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on "Sehnen" (yearning). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in Act 3 of ''Tristan'', but later rejected the idea.<ref>''Dokumente zur Entstehung und ersten Auffuhrung des Buhnenweihfestspiels Parsifal'' by Richard Wagner, Martin Geck, Egon Voss.  Reviewed by Richard Evidon in Notes, 2nd Ser., Vol. 28, No. 4 (Jun., 1972), pp. 685-687.</ref>

Many [[music theorists]] have used ''Parsifal'' to explore difficulties in [[music analysis|analyzing]] the [[chromaticism]] of late 19th century music. Theorists such as [[David Lewin]] and [[Richard Cohn]] have explored the importance of certain pitches and harmonic progressions both in structuring and symbolizing the work.<ref>David Lewin, "Amfortas' Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in ''Parsifal'': The Tonal Spaces of the Drama and the Enharmonic Cb/B," in ''Studies in Music with Text'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 183-200.</ref><ref>Richard Cohn, "Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions," ''Music Analysis'' 15:1 (1996), 9-40.</ref> The unusual harmonic progressions in the [[leitmotifs]] which structure the piece, as well as the heavy chromaticism of Act II, make it a difficult work to parse not only philosophically, but musically.

==Listening to ''Parsifal''==

This section serves as an introduction to appreciating the music of ''Parsifal''.

===Leitmotifs===

A [[leitmotif]] is a recurring musical theme associated within a particular piece of music with a particular person, place or idea. Wagner is the composer most often associated with leitmotifs, and ''Parsifal'' makes liberal use of them. The opening prelude introduces two important leitmotifs, the Communion theme and the Grail. These two, and Parsifal's own motive, are repeatedly referenced during the course of the opera. Other characters, especially Klingsor, Amfortas, and "The Voice," which sings the Tormotif (Fool's motive), have their own particular leitmotifs. Wagner uses the [[Dresden amen]] to represent the Grail, this motif being a sequence of notes he would have known since his childhood in [[Dresden]].

===Notable Arias and orchestral excepts===

As is common in mature Wagner operas, Parsifal was composed with each act being a continuous block of music ([[Through_composed|''"durchcomponiert"'']]), hence there are no free-standing [[arias]] in the work. However a number of orchestral excerpts from the opera were arranged by Wagner himself and remain in the concert repertory. The overture to Act 1 is frequently performed either alone or in conjunction with an arrangement of the "Good Friday" music which accompanies the second half of Act 3 scene 1. Kundry's long solo in Act 2 (''"Ich sah das Kind"'') is occasionally performed in concert, as is Amfortas' lament from Act 1 (''"Wehvolles Erbe"'').

===Recordings of Parsifal===

Parsifal was expressly composed for the stage at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] and many of the most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage.  In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth which are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc (they also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were later melted down by the Nazis during World War II). [[Hans Knappertsbusch]] was the conductor most closely associated with Parsifal at Bayreuth in the post-war years, and the performances under his baton in 1951 marked the re-opening of the [[Bayreuth Festival]] after the [[Second World War]]. These historic performances were recorded and are available on the Teldec label in mono sound. Knappertsbusch recorded the opera again for Philips in 1962 in stereo, and this release is often considered to be the classic Parsifal recording.<ref>Holloway, Robin (1982) in "Opera on Record", Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-090910-2</ref>.
There are also many "unofficial" live recordings from Bayreuth, capturing virtually every Parsifal cast ever conducted by Knappertsbusch.

Amongst the studio recordings, those by [[Georg Solti]], [[Herbert von Karajan]] and [[Daniel Barenboim]] (the latter two both conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]]) have been widely praised.<ref>Blyth, Alan (1992), "Opera on CD" Kyle Cathie Ltd, ISBN 1-85626-056-9</ref>. The von Karajan recording was voted "Record of the Year" in the 1981 [[Gramophone Awards]]. Also highly regarded is a recording of Parsifal under the baton of [[Rafael Kubel<U+00ED>k]] originally made for Deutsche Grammophon, now reissued on Arts Archives.

There are many recordings of Parsifal, some of the most popular being listed below.

====The bells====
For the entrance to the castle of Monsalvat in acts one and three, Wagner scored a repeating four-note theme, C G A E, to be played on bells.  The theme is very low, ranging from the C in the [[bass clef]] to the E below it, and consequently it is impractical to use [[tubular bell]]s or [[church bell]]s.  Wagner experimented with several options to get his desired effect, including [[gong]]s, metal [[drum]]s, and a specially-built instrument called the [[Parsifal bell]] which was similar to a piano.  He settled on the metal drums, which were in use at Bayreuth until [[1940]], when they were melted down by the Nazis for ammunition.

Modern performances of Parsifal usually use synthesized bells.
