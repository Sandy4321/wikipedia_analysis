Mason was elected [[Mayor]] of Pukekohe in 1915. He was left-wing in his political outlook, and joined the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] on its foundation in 1916. In the [[New Zealand general election 1919|1919 general election]], he was Labour's candidate for the seat of [[Manukau (NZ electorate)|Manukau]], but was defeated. Later, he shifted his attention to the seat of [[Eden (NZ electorate)|Eden]] &mdash; he contested it in the [[New Zealand general election 1922|1922 election]] and [[New Zealand general election 1925|1925 election]]. He finally won Eden in a [[Eden by-election 1926|1926 by-election]], assisted by the fact that the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]]'s vote was split by a defeated nominee, [[Ellen Melville]].

Throughout his parliamentary career, Mason remained highly involved in the organisation of the Labour Party. He served as its president from 1931 to 1933, and played a major role in policy formulation. Mason was regarded as a [[social democrat]] rather than a [[socialism|socialist]], and he played a part in moving the Labour Party closer to the political centre. He did, however, believe that the state should have exclusive control over the country's financial system, influenced by [[social credit]] monetary reform theories. Other causes supported by Mason include the establishment of a comprehensive old-age pension system and the granting of full state services to [[naturalisation|naturalised]] immigrants (the latter making him extremely popular with his electorate's substantial [[Yugoslavia]]n community).

When Labour won the [[New Zealand general election 1935|1935 general election]], Mason became [[Attorney General (New Zealand)|Attorney General]] and [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]], reflecting his legal background. When disputes arose between the party leadership and [[John A. Lee]]'s more radical faction, Mason remained on good terms with both sides &mdash; while he sympathised with some of Lee's points, particularly regarding monetary reform, he did not join Lee's breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]]. Mason later served as [[Minister of Education (New Zealand)|Minister of Education]] (where he worked closely with [[C.E. Beeby]] to implement educational reforms) and as [[Minister of Maori Affairs|Minister of Native Affairs]]. In 1941 the Public Service Commissioner [[Thomas Mark]] died in (or just outside) the minister's office, during an confrontation with Mason who wanted the resignation of the head of a department.  

He was not returned to Cabinet after the [[New Zealand general election 1946|1946 election]], but returned to fill a vacancy the following year. After Labour lost office, he continued to agitate on a number of issues, notably [[decimal currency]]. After Labour won the [[New Zealand general election 1957|1957 election]], Mason returned to his original roles of Attorney General and Minister of Justice. He was also made [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]]. 

Rex Mason represented the seat of [[Eden (NZ electorate)|Eden]] in the 22nd parliament (1926-28), [[Auckland Suburbs (NZ electorate)|Auckland Suburbs]] in the 23rd to 27th parliaments (1928-46), [[Waitakere (NZ electorate)|Waitakere]] in the 28th to 33rd parliaments (1946-63), and [[New Lynn (NZ electorate)|New Lynn]] in the 34th parliament (1963-66). 

Mason eventually retired from politics at the [[New Zealand general election 1966|1966 election]], under a certain amount of pressure from colleagues who wished to "rejuvenate" the Labour Party. Mason was now in his eighties, and was one of the longest serving New Zealand MPs ever, with a career of 40 years from 15 April 1926 to 25 October 1966.

==Personal affairs==
Mason married Dulcia Martina Rockell on 27 December 1912, and had three children. Through his wife's influence, Mason become interested in [[India]]n religion and spirituality, and beliefs derived from it (particularly [[Theosophy]]). He was a [[vegetarian]] and a [[teetotaller]]. 

Mason died in Wellington on 2 April 1975, aged 89.
