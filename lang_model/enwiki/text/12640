==Education==
[[File:ZHS.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A light red, tall building. In front of it are large trees and a small crowd of college-age students.|Povenmire attended the [[University of Southern California]].]]
Povenmire received [[secondary education]] at Shaw High School,<ref name="summers"/> graduating in 1981.<ref name="class">{{cite web|url=http://www.classmates.com/directory/public/memberprofile/list.htm?regId=8691491442|title=Dan Povenmire|work=Classmates.com|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> He attended the [[University of South Alabama]], where he created his first popular comic strip: a series, "Life is a Fish," devoted to the secret life of a [[gold fish]], while making a living performing and waiting at a [[dinner theater]].<ref name="USC"/> He transferred to the [[University of Southern California]] in 1985, hoping to pursue a career in film.<ref name="USC"/><ref name="summers"/><ref name="alumni">{{cite web|url=http://www.hopstudios.com/dtlink/listP.html|title=Daily Trojan Alumni Link Where Are They Now? P List|accessdate=2009-08-04|date=2003-09-27|work=Hop Studios}}</ref>

At USC, he pitched ''Life is a Fish'' immediately to [[Mark Ordesky]], the then editor-in-chief of college newspaper the ''[[Daily Trojan]].'' Ordesky initially "basically brushed [him] off" but after viewing his portfolio accepted the strip. ''Fish'' ran every day in the paper. Though the rapid pace left Povenmire afraid he was "running out of ideas", he never missed a deadline and made [[US dollar|$]]14,000 a year through ''Fish'' merchandising, including [[t-shirts]], [[books]], and [[calendars]] sold at the campus craft fair.<ref name="USC"/> The discipline of regular production also helped teach Povenmire to "represent something in the least amount of lines."<ref name="Green 90"/>

==Career==
===Early works===
[[File:Tommy Chong in 2008.jpg|thumb|alt=A tan man with a white beard and white hair, wearing a black shirt. In one hand he has a microphone close to his mouth and the other is elevated next to his neck. Behind him is a wooden structure with a few posters on it.|[[Tommy Chong]] was one of the first people to give Povenmire a job in the animation business, hiring him to do two minutes of animation for the film ''[[Far Out Man]]'' (1990)]]
Povenmire dropped out of USC<ref name="USC"/> without gaining a [[college degree]],<ref name="summers"/> using the money from ''Fish's'' merchandise to fund a short career as a [[street artist]]. His first professional animation comission came on the [[Tommy Chong]] project ''[[Far Out Man]],'' for which Povenmire produced two minutes of animation. By age 21 Povenmire was freelancing on several animated television series, including ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].''<ref name="USC"/>

In the 1990s Povenmire secured a job on the hit animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''<ref name="USC"/><ref name="AM1"/> as a character layout animator.<ref name="Green 89">[[#Green|Greenspon]] (2003), pp. 89</ref> There he sat opposite [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh|Jeffery Marsh]], later to become a colleague on several projects, with whom he bonded over shared tastes in humor and music.<ref name="AM1"/> 

Povenmire's epxerience, from previous industry work and from his own projects, earned him respect at ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="Green 90"/> As well as layout animation he collaborated on [[storyboard]] production for the series, recalling later that staff were handed pages of producer notes and instructed to "Do the Brad Bird notes and any others that make sense."<ref name="QA"/> He maintained a side interest in film, writing scripts<ref name="summers"/> and the screenplay for low-budget horror movie ''[[Psycho Cop 2]]''.<ref name="411news"/><ref name="summers"/> The producers offered Povenmire the chance to direct the film too, but its terms required that he quit ''The Simpsons'':  Povenmire chose to stay at the show, which he enjoyed and considered a better fit with his future ambitions.<ref name="summers"/> ''Psycho Cop 2'' was directed instead by Rif Coogan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slasher Films: An International Filmography, 1960 through 2001|date=2003|author=Armstrong, Kent|page=240|isbn=0786414626|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]}}</ref>

===''Rocko's Modern Life''===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote= "I could have just stayed at 'The Simpsons' ad infinitum. I have friends there who were there when I was and are still working on the show. But animation is such that at the end of production they lay off all the artists and then at the end of post-production they bring all the artists back. I was looking at a two- or three-month downtime." |source= <U+2014>Povenmire, on leaving ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''<ref name="summers"/>}}
Work at ''The Simpsons'' involved irregular schedules. After production, the show laid off all the animation staff for two- to three-month "downtime" periods, before rehiring them later in the production cycle. During one of these "downtime" spells Povenmire found a job on the series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]],''<ref name="summers"/> [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s first "in-house" cartoon production.<ref>[[#Rocko|Neuwirth]] (2003), pp. 50</ref><ref>[[#Rocko|Neuwirth]] (2003), pp. 252</ref><ref>[[#Rocko|Neuwirth]] (2003), pp. 253</ref> The show's creator, television newcomer Joe Murray, hired Povenmire on the strength of his ''Life is a Fish'' comic strips,<ref name="USC"/> which he said were proof that Povenmire could "write and draw."<ref name="summers"/> 

Though Povenmire started on ''Rocko'' simply to occupy his downtime from ''The Simpsons'' he found the greater creative freedom he enjoyed on the new show compelling, and quit ''The Simpsons'' to work on ''Rocko'' full time. There he reunited with Jeff Marsh, this time as a writing partner;<ref name="AM1"/> Marsh claimed the crew hoped Povenmire's neatness would offset his own sloppy storyboarding.<ref name="411news"/> The pair developed a distinctive style, including in their stories characteristic musical numbers and [[chase scene]]s.<ref name="AM2">{{cite web|url= http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3534&page=2|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 2.|author=Strike, Joe.|work=Animation World Magazine|date=2008-02-01}}</ref> The pair won an Environmental Achievement Award for their ''Rocko'' episode "Zanzibar!", Povenmire having won his first award while working on the series in 1996. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0693933/awards|title=Awards for Dan Povenmire|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

In 1993 Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]],''<ref name="USC"/> based on their childhood experiences of summers outdoors. Povenmire went through several unsuccessful pitches to get the series picked up.<ref name="AM1"/>

===''Family Guy''===
[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Caucasian male with black hair and stubble, along with a black shirt. His hand is placed under his chin and a microphone is in front of him. A vague symbol is marked behind him.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] gave Povenmire a large amount of freedom while directing episodes of ''[[Family Guy]].'']]
Povenmire later became a director on ''[[Family Guy]].''<ref name="AM3">{{cite web|url= http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3534&page=3|title= From Swampy & Dan Emerges Phineas and Ferb", Page 3.|author=Strike, Joe.|work=Animation World Magazine|date=2008-02-01}}</ref> Creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him "We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you." Povenmire praised this management style for letting him "have [...] fun."<ref name="QA"/>

Povenmire brought realism, and material from his own experiences, to the visual direction of ''Family Guy''.<ref name="P174">[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 174</ref><ref name="P142">[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 142</ref> For "[[One if By Clam, Two if By Sea]]" (August 1, 2001)<ref>[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 140</ref>, several characters carried out fosse moves in prison - Povenmire went into the office of a color artist, Cynthia MacIntosh, who had been a professional dancer, and had her strike poses in order for him to better illustrate the sequence.<ref name="P142"/> In the episode "[[To Love and Die in Dixie]]" (November 15, 2001)<ref>[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 171</ref> Povenmire drew on his childhood in the deep south to sequence a background scene where the "[[redneck]]" character nonchalantly kicks a [[corpse]] into the nearby [[river]].<ref name="P174"/>

"[[Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows]]" (January 17, 2002), a ''Family Guy'' episode which Povenmire directed,<ref>[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 192</ref> won the [[Emmy Award]] for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded "That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!"<ref>[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), pp. 194</ref> Povenmire was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]" (November 6, 2005)<ref>{{cite news|title=The Programming Insider|work=[[Mediaweek]]|author=Berman, Marc|date=2005-11-09}}</ref> but lost out to fellow ''Family Guy'' director [[Peter Shin]] for the episode "[[North By North Quahog]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annieawards.org/33rdwinners.html|title=Legacy: 33rd Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners (2005)|publisher=[[Annie Awards]]|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>

===''Phineas and Ferb''===
{{main|Phineas and Ferb}}
Povenmire spent 14 to 16 years pitching ''Phineas and Ferb'', the series he and Jeff Marsh had devised, to several networks.<ref name="QA"/><ref name="AM1"/> Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots,<ref name="AM3"/> but Povenmire persevered, later observing "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on."<ref name="AM1"/> [[The Walt Disney Company]] initially rejected Povenmire's pitch too, but asked to keep the packet: "Usually that means they throw it in the trash later," Povenmire later said,<ref name="USC"/> but eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on condition that an 11-minute version of the show could be produced.<ref name="AM2"/> He called Marsh, who was living in [[England]], to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.<ref name="AM3"/>

Instead of a conventional script the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved, and greenlit the show for a 26-episode season.<ref name="OP"/><ref name="AM2"/> Povenmire effectively left ''Family Guy'' in order to create the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/30427/family-guy-volume-seven-who-says-seven-is-a-lucky-number|title="Family Guy Volume Seven": Who Says Seven is a Lucky Number?|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2009-08-06|work=Toon Zone}}</ref>

Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into the show the kind of humor they had developed in their work on ''Rocko's Modern Life.'' They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode after "[[Flop Starz]]". <ref name="AM2"/> Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's "jab at [[immortality]]."<ref name="USC"/> The pair have earned two Emmy nominations for ''Phineas and Ferb'' songs to date.<ref name="411news"/> A third Emmy nomination, for the episode "[[The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein]]" in 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/profiles/TVSeries/main/181773/Phineas+and+Ferb.html?dataSet=1|title=Phineas and Ferb|work=[[Variety]]|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref> pitted the show against ''[[Spongebob Squarepants]],''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/10314#|title=Phineas and Ferb Creators Talk About Emmy Nom!|author=Zahed, Ramin|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-98-06|work=[[Animation Magazine]]}}</ref> though neither nominees became recipients of the award due to a technicality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/136406123|title=For Montvale Boy, It Was All Worth the Tux|work=California Chronicle|author=Fujimori, Sachi|accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> For the show's artistic style the pair drew influences from [[Tex Avery]], using geometric shapes to build the characters and the background. The style was determined by Povenmire's first sketch of title character [[Phineas Flynn]], which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in [[South Pasadena, California]]. He doodled a [[triangle]]-shaped child on the [[butcher paper]] covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and the stylistic blueprint for the whole show.<ref name="AM3"/>

===Musical endeavors===
During college Povenmire performed with a band that played at clubs and bars across [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="USC"/> His current band, Keep Left, releases albums through Arizona University Recordings. Their second CD, "Letters from Fielding," became available for download on aurec.com during 2004.<ref name="alumni"/> They have an official website maintained and updated by artist Larry Stone.<ref name="badmouth">{{cite web|url=http://www.badmouth.net/comic-strip-war/|title=comic strip war|author=Marcotte, John|work=Badmouth|date=2004-01-22|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> An 2004 email exchange about the website between Stone and Povenmire resulted in a "clever and twisted" series of comic strips drawn by the two, eventually moved to the website Badmouth.<ref name="badmouth"/>

==Personal life==
Povenmire married Clarissa, an industrial designer and model maker, in [[Venezuela]] in 2001.<ref name="alumni"/> He has two daughters, Isabella and Melissa; Isabella gave her name to a ''Phineas and Ferb'' character.
