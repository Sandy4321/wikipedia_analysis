'''''Des Imagistes''''' was the first anthology of the [[Imagism]] movement.  It was issued in the United States in book form and simultaneously in the literary periodical ''[[The Glebe (literary magazine)|The Glebe]]'' for February 1914 (issue #5){{ref|glebe5}}.It was also published in [[1914 in poetry|1914]] in London at [[Harold Monro]]'s [[Poetry Bookshop]]. 

[[Richard Aldington]]&mdash;whose work appears in the anthology, and along with [[H.D.]] was the first poet to be dubbed 'imagiste' by [[Ezra Pound]]&mdash;later wrote regarding the title of this anthology: "What Ezra thought that meant remains a mystery, unless the word "Anthologie" was assumed to precede it. [[Amy Lowell]]'s anthologies were called ''Some Imagist Poets'', so she may have supposed that Ezra thought "Des Imagistes" meant "Quelques Imagistes." But why a French title for a collection of poems by a bunch of young American and English authors? Search me. Ezra liked foreign titles."

The eleven authors featured were: [[Richard Aldington]], [[Skipwith Cannell]], [[John Cournos]], [[H. D.]], [[F. S. Flint]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[James Joyce]], [[Amy Lowell]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Allen Upward]], [[William Carlos Williams]]
