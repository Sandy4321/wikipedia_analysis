Poitras had already been working for several years on a film about monitoring programs in the US, the result of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Ronnie Scheib of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "No amount of familiarity with whistleblower Edward Snowden and his shocking revelations of the U.S. government<U+2019>s wholesale spying on its own citizens can prepare one for the impact of Laura Poitras<U+2019>s extraordinary documentary ''Citizenfour''... far from reconstructing or analyzing a fait accompli, the film tersely records the deed in real time, as Poitras and fellow journalist Glenn Greenwald meet Snowden over an eight-day period in a Hong Kong hotel room to plot how and when they will unleash the bombshell that shook the world. Adapting the cold language of data encryption to recount a dramatic saga of abuse of power and justified paranoia, Poitras brilliantly demonstrates that information is a weapon that cuts both ways."<ref>{{citation

Spencer Ackerman writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "''Citizenfour'' must have been a maddening documentary to film. Its subject is pervasive global surveillance, an enveloping digital act that spreads without visibility, so its scenes unfold in courtrooms, hearing chambers and hotels. Yet the virtuosity of Laura Poitras, its director and architect, makes its 114 minutes crackle with the nervous energy of revelation."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/11/citizenfour-review-snowden-vindicated-poitras-nsa-journalism | title=''Citizenfour'' Review&nbsp;<U+2013> Poitras' Victorious Film Shows Snowden Vindicated | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=October 11, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2014 | last=Ackerman | first=Spencer}}</ref>

The Academy rejected the claim, noting that "the ''Guardian'' interview appears in less than two minutes of the documentary", and ruled that ''Citizenfour'' was eligible for Oscar consideration.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-rejects-challenge-citizenfour-oscar-759987 |title=Academy Rejects Challenge to ''Citizenfour'' Oscar Eligibility |author=Scott Feinberg |date=December 23, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>
