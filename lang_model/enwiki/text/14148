His most recent success came at the 2006 European Championships, held in [[Ra<U+010D>ice]], Czech Republic, where he won a K4 1000m bronze medal. At the [[2006 Flatwater Racing World Championships]] however the German four finished outside the medals, finishing 4th (1000m), 6th (500m) and 5th (200m), thus putting to an end Bach's record of having won medals at seven consecutive world championships.
