'''Stanley Aronowitz''' (born [[1933]]) is professor of [[sociology]], cultural studies, and [[urban education]] at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. He is also a veteran political activist and cultural critic and a passionate champion of [[organized labor]].

==''Social Text''==

He is the author of numerous books on [[class]], [[culture]], [[sociology of science]], and [[politics]]. With [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[John Brenkman]], he is a founding editor of ''[[Social Text]]'', a journal that is subtitled "Theory, Culture, Ideology." He has written that with this publication their "objective was to interrogate Marxists' habitual separation of political economy and culture and to make a contribution to their articulation, even reunification." 

As editor of ''Social Text'' he was responsible for publishing [[Alan Sokal]]'s [[1996]] article 'Transgressing the boundaries : Towards a transformative hermenuetics of quantum gravity', which was later revealed by Sokal to be a hoax: the paper was a mishmash of nonsense (and admiration for Aronowitz's own views), whose acceptance for publication, Sokal claimed, illustrated the low intellectual standards of the journal (see [[Sokal Affair]]).

==Green politics==

In 2002, Aronowitz led the fight to maintain the official ballot status of the [[Green Party (US)|Green Party]] in [[New York Green Party|New York]] and [[New York gubernatorial election, 2002|ran for governor]] on that ticket the same year. He ran a grass roots campaign based on a radical democratic program that combined opposition to corporate power and plutocratic government with commitment to a sustainable environment, racial equality, feminism, gay liberation and individual freedom. He is also an active [[trade union]]ist and a member of the executive council of his university's union, the Professional Staff Congress. Aronowitz is a proponent of a reduced work week, among other strategies for improving everyday life, and works actively with the [[Basic Income Earth Network]] toward the furtherance of such goals.

==Other activities==

In 2005 he co-founded the journal "Situations." He has also published articles in numerous publications and with a core group of intellectuals--faculty and students-- at the Graduate Center, he spearheaded the effort to create the Center for Cultural Studies in the spirit of fostering intellectual debate, multidisciplinarity, and the toppling of high cultural privilege in academia. 

==Family==

He lives in [[New York City]]. He was married to [[Ellen Willis]] until her death in November 2006. He has five children.
