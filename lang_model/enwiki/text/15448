'''Marjory Stoneman Douglas''' ([[April 7]] [[1890]] - [[May 14]] [[1998]]) was an American [[journalist]] and [[environmentalist]] most associated with battles to stop the draining and development of the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]]. Douglas grew up in [[Massachusetts]], married early but briefly, and moved to a very young Miami to work for ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. She became a [[freelance writer]], producing over a hundred [[short stories]] that were published in popular magazines. Her 1947 book ''[[The Everglades: River of Grass]]'' redefined popular conception of the Everglades as a river worth saving instead of a worthless swamp, and its impact is compared to that of ''[[Silent Spring]]''.  Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami that she used in order to advance her causes.

Outspoken and politically conscious of many issues even as a young woman, Douglas was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 78&nbsp;years old. For the remaining thirty years of her life she was "a relentless reporter and fearless crusader" for the natural preservation and restoration of the nature of South Florida.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;204</ref> Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname "Grande dame of the Everglades"<ref>Basse, Craig ([[May 15]], [[1998]]). "Grande dame of the Everglades." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p.&nbsp;1A.</ref> as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from the land development in Florida. Numerous awards were given to her, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], and she was inducted into several halls of fame.

Douglas lived until age 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' in [[London]] stated, "In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas."<ref>Cornwell, Rupert (May 25, 1998). "Obituary: Marjory Stoneman Douglas." ''The Independent'' (London); p. 16.</ref> 

==Early life==
[[Image:Stoneman Family In 1893.jpg|thumb|200 px|The Stoneman and Trefethen extended family in 1893. Marjory is held by her father on the right.]]Marjory Stoneman was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], as an only child to [[Frank Bryant Stoneman]], and Lillian Trefethen, a concert violinist. One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her ''[[Song of Hiawatha]]'', at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe.<ref>Douglas, p. 42</ref> She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', which she kept well into adulthood until "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back."<ref>Douglas, p. 42</ref> She visited Florida when she was four years old, and her most vivid memory of Florida was picking an orange from a tree at the [[Tampa Bay Hotel]].<ref>Douglas, p. 31</ref> From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from [[Tampa]] to [[Havana]].<ref name="duncan">Duncan, Scott (May 15, 1998). "Marjory, we loved you so." ''The Miami Herald''; Commentary.</ref> 

When she was six years old, her parents separated and she was raised in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] with her mother, aunt, and grandmother. Her mother, whom Douglas characterized as "high strung" was committed to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental sanitarium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] several times. Her parents' separation and the contentious life with her mother's family caused her to suffer from [[night terrors]].<ref>Douglas, p. 47, 48</ref> Douglas credited her tenuous upbringing for making her "a skeptic and a dissenter" for the rest of her life.<ref>Douglas, p. 50</ref> As her mother's mental health deteriorated, she found herself taking over for her mother, gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance. She even took over some of the family finances.<ref>Douglas, p. 53-54</ref>  

===Education and marriage===
[[Image:Douglas Wellesley.jpg|thumb|left|100 px|Marjory Stoneman in her senior year at [[Wellesley College]].]]She left for college in 1908, feeling then that her mother was approaching death. Her aunt and grandmother noticed it too, but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life.<ref>Douglas, p. 69</ref> Douglas was a good student without having to study too much.<ref name="friends">{{cite web|url=http://www.everglades.org/msd.html|title=Marjory Stoneman Douglas}} Friends of the Everglades website. Retrieved on December 17, 2007.</ref> She attended [[Wellesley College]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English in 1912. She found particular gifts in a class on [[elocution]], and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates.<ref>Douglas, p. 77-78</ref> She was elected as "Class Orator" at Wellesley, but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Douglas arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized and within months her mother was dead. Douglas was depended upon to make the funeral arrangements.<ref>Douglas, p. 78-82</ref> 

After drifting with college friends in a few jobs she didn't feel she was well-suited for, she met Kenneth Douglas in 1914 and was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He was a newspaper editor thirty years older than she was, and the marriage failed. He spent six months in jail for [[fraud|passing a bad check]], and then tried to [[scam]] her absent father out of money.<ref>Douglas, p.86, 89</ref><ref name="newsmakers">"Marjory Stoneman Douglas."'' Newsmakers 1998'', Issue 4. Gale Group, 1998</ref> She reflected later that her marriage also did not work due to her independent nature, and her participation in causes such as [[women's suffrage]] and environmental issues.<ref name="scribner">Mason, Kathy. "Marjory Stoneman Douglas." ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Volume 5: 1997-1999. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002.</ref> She moved to Miami in the fall of 1915 to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation when she was six years old.

==Writing career==
===''The Miami Herald''===
Douglas' father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.  Stoneman was passionately against the governor of Florida, [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for [[circuit judge]], Governor Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman was referred to as "Judge" for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one.<ref>Douglas, p. 98-99</ref>

She joined the staff of the newspaper originally as a society columnist, writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long.'"<ref name="fichter"/> When her father went on vacation, he left her the responsibility of the [[editorial]] page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at the ''Miami Metropolis'' whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.<ref>Douglas, p. 109</ref> She was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman to join the [[US Naval Reserve]] from Miami. When the woman didn't show up for the story, Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a [[yeoman]] first class. She did not like it very much, so she requested a discharge and joined the [[American Red Cross]], where she was stationed in [[Paris, France]] and had the occasion to witness the crowds celebrating on the [[Rue de Rivoli]] when the Armistice was signed.<ref>Douglas, p. 118<U+2014>119</ref> She also cared for war [[refugee]]s, and seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, "helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later."<ref>Douglas, p. 116</ref>  

Returning after the [[World War I|War]], she took over the duties as assistant editor at ''The Miami Herald''. She gained some renown in her articles, and had enough influence through the newspaper that she became somewhat of a local celebrity. Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the wealth of the region being in its "inevitable development", and she supplemented her income by $100 US a week by writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life.<ref>Grunwald, p. 182</ref> Douglas also wrote passionate stories supporting women's suffrage and [[civil rights]] while at the ''Herald''. She wrote a [[ballad]] in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 16-year-old [[vagrant]] who was beaten to death in a [[labor camp]], titled "Martin Tabert of [[North Dakota]] is Walking Florida Now". The ballad was printed in ''The Miami Herald'', and read aloud during a session of the Florida legislature, who passed a law making the beating of vagrants illegal, in large part due to her writing.<ref name="fichter"/> "I think that's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I've written," she wrote in her autobiography.<ref>Douglas, p. 134</ref>

===Freelance writer===
After quitting the newspaper, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the [[pulp fiction]] magazine ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' for $600 US. Her story "Peculiar Treasure of a King" was a second-place finalist in the [[O. Henry Award]] competition in 1928. Many of her stories were published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', one titled "Story of a Homely Woman", was reprinted in 1937 in the ''Post's'' best short stories compilation.<ref name="scribner"/> Many of her protagonists were independent women, and the people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings, including "Plumes" in 1930, originally published in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', that was based on the murder of an Audubon Society warden by [[poacher]]s, and "Wings", also in the ''Post'' in 1931, that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers.

During the 1930s, Douglas was commissioned to write a [[pamphlet]] supporting a botanical garden called "An argument for the establishment of a [[tropical]] [[botanical garden]] in South Florida". Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area, then to serve on the board to support the Fairchild Garden. She called the garden "one of the greatest achievements for the entire area."<ref>Douglas, p. 176</ref>

Douglas became involved with the [[Miami Theater]], and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, entitled, "The Gallows Gate", was about an argument a mother and father have regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West, and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts.<ref>Douglas, p. 183</ref>

===''The Everglades: River of Grass''===
[[Image:Everglades River of Grass.jpg|thumb|150 px|''The Everglades: River of Grass'', published in 1947, still influences how the Everglades are managed.]]Early in the 1940s she was approached by a publisher to contribute to the [[Rivers of America Series]] and write about the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]]. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about "an inch long,"<ref name="scribner"/> but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them. Her book ''[[The Everglades: River of Grass]]'', was published in 1947 after five years of research and sold out of its first printing a month after being released.<ref name="newsmakers"/> The first line of the book, "There are no other Everglades in the world," has been called the "most famous passage ever written about the Everglades,"<ref>Grunwald, p. 205</ref> and the statement welcomes visitors to the Everglades National Park website.<ref>National Park Service. {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm|title=Everglades National Park}} Everglades National Park website.</ref>  It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000 copies since its original publication. It galvanized people to protect the Everglades and is compared to ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] as both books are "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice."<ref>Hauserman, Julie (October 14, 2007). "Paradise down the drain." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p. 9L</ref> Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists,<ref>Buchana, Edna (March 15, 2003). "Miami advice; If you're wondering why so many people flock to Florida, Edna Buchanan nominates three books to explain its unique allure." ''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada) p. D19</ref> and "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades."<ref>Davis, Pamela (July 16, 2001). "Women who made a difference". ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); 3D.</ref> The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' wrote of it in 1997 that, "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a [[blueprint]] for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world."<ref>Richey, Warren (September 3, 1997). "Reviving Florida's Fragile 'River of Grass'." ''Christian Science Monitor''; p. 4</ref>

Douglas served as the book review editor of ''The Miami Herald'' from 1942 to 1949, and served as editor to the [[University of Miami]] Press from 1960 to 1963. She released her first novel, entitled ''Road to the Sun'' in 1952. She wrote four novels, all about Florida, and several non-fiction books on regional topics including Florida [[birdwatching]] and David Fairchild, the [[entomologist]] turned [[biologist]] who imagined a botanical park in [[Miami]]. She co-wrote an [[autobiography]] entitled ''Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River'' with John Rothchild in 1987. She had been  working on a book about [[W. H. Hudson]] for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.<ref>Leposky, Rosalie (1997). "Marjory Stoneman Douglas: A Bibliography". ''Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Journal of Florida Literature'' '''8''' p. 55-73.</ref>

==Activism==
In 1916 she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s wife, and two other women to [[Tallahassee]] to speak in support of women's right to vote, an experience she wrote about: "All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to [[graven image]]s. They never paid attention to us at all."<ref name="byers"/> Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.

In the 1920s, Douglas served on Coconut Grove [[Slum]] Clearance Committee, when a friend of Douglas' named Elizabeth Virrick was horrified to learn that there was no running water or [[sewer]]s connected to a part of the city that was called "Colored Town", that is modern-day [[Overtown, Miami, Florida|Overtown]]. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the [[referendum]] passed, they worked to set up a [[loan]] operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money [[interest]]-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.<ref>[[June 16]], [[1983]].{{cite web|url=http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC95A_10.htm|title=Elizabeth Virrick's work in Coconut Grove's black community: Interview with Marjory Stoneman Douglas}} Florida International University website.

===Everglades work===
Douglas began her interest in the Everglades in the 1920s when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by [[Ernest F. Coe]], dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. In the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever due to gross mismanagement in the name of progress, land development, and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, at the age of 78 she founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a [[jetport]] in the [[Big Cypress]] portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, "It is a woman's business to be interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping."<ref name="fichter"/> She toured the state giving "hundreds of ringing denunciations" of the airport project,<ref>Grunwald, p. 257-258</ref> gathering more members of the organization: with a year there were 500, within three years there were 3,000. She ran the public information operation full time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport's developers and backers, who called her a "damn butterfly chaser."<ref name="davis"/> President [[Richard Nixon]], however, scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups.

Douglas criticized two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades. A coalition of sugarcane growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting Lake Okeechobee by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, that served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area.<ref>Douglas, Marjory [[May 6]], [[1983]]. {{cite web|url=http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC930_11.htm|title=Pollution caused by growing sugar in Florida}} Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale, transcript on Florida International University website. Retrieved on [[January 26]], [[2008]].</ref> She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies, that she claimed was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.<ref>Douglas, Marjory [[May 6]], [[1983]]. {{cite web|url=http://everglades.fiu.edu/two/transcripts/SPC930_12.htm|title=Damages caused by the Army Corps of Engineers and Big Sugar}} Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale, transcript on Florida International University website. Retrieved on [[January 26]], [[2008]].</ref> She was labeled as "the [[anti-Christ]]"<ref name="davis"/> by sugarcane growers for the attention she brought them.

Along with Big Sugar, Douglas spoke about the damage the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the [[Central & South Florida Project]] (C&SF), run by former members of the Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much needed water to the shrinking Everglades. But in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable.<ref>Grunwald, p. 241</ref><ref name="davis"/> "What a liar I turned out to be!" remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement."<ref>Grunwald, p. 241, 243</ref> Douglas gave a speech addressing the harmful practices by the Army Corps of Engineers when the [[colonel]] in attendance dropped his pen on the floor. As he was stooping to pick it up, Douglas stopped her speech and said to him, "Colonel! You can crawl under that table and hide, but you can't get away from me!"<ref>Hauserman, Julie (April 19, 1999). "Leaving an environmental hot seat" ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); p. 1B</ref>

In 1973, Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in [[Everglades City]], and was observed by John Rothchild: <blockquote>"Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like [[Scarlet O'Hara]] as played by [[Igor Stravinsky]]. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping [[mosquitoes]] and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes...The request for a [[Corps of Engineers]] permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak."<ref name="friends"/></blockquote>
 
Douglas was not well-received by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in [[Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, she was the only opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed by the audience of residents. "Can't you boo any louder than that?" she chided, eventually making them laugh. "They're all good souls - they just shouldn't be out there," she wrote.<ref>Douglas, p. 232</ref> Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.

Florida [[Governor]] [[Lawton Chiles]] explained her impact, saying, "Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life. She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement, she was a [[prophet]], calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren."<ref name="fichter"/>

===Other causes===
Douglas also served as a charter member of the first [[American Civil Liberties Union]] chapter organized in the South in the 1950s.<ref name="davis"/> She lent her support to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify the amendment. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect [[migrant]] farm workers who were centered around [[Belle Glade]], and who were primarily employed by the [[sugarcane]] industry. She wrote to Governor [[Bob Graham]] in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured.<ref name="davis"/> The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own.  The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8 million US for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in [[Crandon Park]].<ref>Long, Theodora. {{cite web|url=http://www.biscaynenaturecenter.org|title=Housed in a hot dog stand}} Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center website.

==Personal life==
===Religious views===
Although Douglas grew up in an [[Episcopalian]] household, she claimed to be [[agnostic]] throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony in her memorial.<ref name="fichter">Fichter, Margaria (May 14, 2008). "Pioneering environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas dies at 108". ''The Miami Herald''; Domestic news.</ref> However, she credited the motivation for her support of [[women's suffrage]] to her [[Quaker]] paternal grandparents whose dedication to the [[abolition of slavery]] she admired, and proudly claimed [[Levi Coffin]] was her great-great-uncle, an organizer of the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name="davis">Davis, Jack (January 2003). "'Conservation is now a dead word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the transformation of American environmentalism." ''Environmental History'' '''8''' (1) p. 53-76.</ref> She wrote that her great-great-aunt was a friend of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' fleeing slavery because Douglas' great-great-aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape.<ref>Douglas, p. 37</ref> 

Douglas admitted the time she spent actually in the Everglades was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. "To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there...It's too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable," she wrote. Instead, she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity.<ref name="davis"/>

===Mental health===
As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents' separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her and her grandparents and aunt, exhibited bizarre, child-like behaviors.<ref>Douglas, p. 56<U+2014>57</ref> Following her mother's death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at ''The Miami Herald'', in the 1920s she suffered the first of several [[nervous breakdown]]s.<ref name="byers">Byers, Stephen (January 3, 1999). "The Lives They Lived: Marjory Stoneman Douglas." ''The New York Times''; p. 46.</ref> Douglas suggested she had had blank periods before, starting during her marriage, but they were brief. She connected these lapses to her mother's insanity.<ref>Douglas, p. 167</ref> She eventually quit the newspaper, but after her father's death in 1941, suffered her third and final breakdown, when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming. She admitted she had a "father complex", explaining it by saying, "Having been brought up without him and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect."<ref>Douglas, p. 188</ref>

===Personal habits===
[[Image:Marjory Stoneman Douglas Cottage.jpg|thumb|200 px|Douglas outside of her Coconut Grove cottage in the early 1920s]]Despite Douglas' demure appearance - she stood at five feet tall and weighed 100 pounds, and was always immaculately dressed in pearls, floppy straw hat and gloves - she had an uncanny ability to get her point across. She was known for speaking in perfect precise paragraphs, and she was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects, and even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades.<ref name="davis"/> Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas wrote of her, "She had a tongue like a [[switchblade]] and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen."<ref name="conserving"/> Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.<ref name="klink obit">Klinkerberg, Jeff. "Though expected, the loss of a hero still stings."  St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 6A.</ref> 

She enjoyed drinking [[Scotch]] and [[sherry]], as one friend remembered her, "She would come up and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, and we would have another sherry. What fun she was."<ref name="fichter"/> Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, stove, or dishwasher.<ref>Douglas, p. 16, 17</ref> 

She was attached to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, she said she didn't believe in [[extramarital sex]] and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying "I wasn't a wild woman."<ref name="conserving">Klinkenberg, Jeff (August 21, 2006). "Conserving the conservationist." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida): p. 1E</ref> However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work.<ref>Grunwald, p. 204</ref><ref>Douglas, p. 85</ref> "People don't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways." she wrote in her autobiography.<ref>Douglas, p. 128</ref>

Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, "Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?"<ref>Douglas, p. 23</ref> Douglas received so many plaques and awards, she stored most of them on the floor of her home.<ref name="conserving"/>

Some of Douglas' stories were collected by [[University of Florida]] professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: ''Nine Florida Stories'' in 1990 and ''A River In Flood'' in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas' short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her fame of an environmentalist, but many did not know about her career as a freelance writer. "Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove," McCarthy wrote in the introduction of ''A River in Flood''.<ref>McCarthy, Kevin (1998). "Introduction". ''A River in Flood''; University Press of Florida.</ref>

Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on [[May 14]], [[1998]]. John Rothchild, who helped write her autobiography said that her death was the only thing that could "shut her up" but added, "The silence is terrible."<ref name="usatoday obit">Watson, Tracy. (May 15, 1988). "Douglas, Everglades' lifesaver, dies at 108 'River of Grass' spoke for marshes." USA TODAY; p. 8A</ref> [[Carl Hiaasen]] eulogized her in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', writing that ''The Everglades: River of Grass'' was "monumental", and praised her passion and her resolve; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for the [[photo opportunity]], she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.<ref>Hiaasen, Carl (May 18, 1998). "A fierce advocate for the Everglades." ''The Miami Herald''; Commentary.</ref>

The [[National Wildlife Federation]] described her as "a passionate, articulate, and tireless voice for the environment,".<ref name="nwf">National Wildlife Federation (2007). {{cite web|url=http://www.nwf.org/about/inductees_douglas.cfm|title=Marjory Stoneman Douglas}} Conservation Hall of Fame website. Retrieved on December 17, 2007</ref> Chairman of the Florida [[Audubon Society]] Ed Davison remembered her, saying, "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't give a lot of credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'"<ref>Howard, Jennifer (May 16, 1999). "Websighting: Marjory Stoneman Douglas." ''The Washington Post'': p. X05</ref> She was aware of it: she was reported saying, "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me."<ref name="fichter"/> Her ashes were scattered over the {{convert|1300000|acre|sqkm}} of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in [[Everglades National Park]].<ref name="severo">Severo, Richard (May 15, 1998). "Marjory Douglas, Champion Of Everglades, Dies at 108." ''The New York Times''; p. 23.</ref>

In 2000, a [[Naples, Florida|Naples]]-based composer named Steve Heitzeg wrote a 15-minute orchestra piece to be performed by the Naples Philharmonic entitled ''Voice of the Everglades (Epitaph for Marjory Stoneman Douglas)''.  Heitzeg explained his motivation for the piece, saying, "She was outspoken, she was direct, she had the energy and belief to make the world a better place."<ref>Fleming, John (November 19, 2000). "The cry of the Everglades." ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida); South Pinellas Edition,  Pg. 10F.</ref> Two South Florida public schools are named in her honor: [[Broward County Public Schools]]' [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] and  [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]]' Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School.

===Douglas home=== 
Douglas' cottage, located in [[Coconut Grove]] at 3744-3754 Stewart Avenue, was built in 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami designated it an historic site in 1995, not only for its famous owner, but for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture.<ref>City of Miami (1995). [http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/ms%20douglas%20hse.pdf Marjory Stoneman Douglas House Designation Report]</ref> Since Douglas' death, her house has been the subject of controversy itself. Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and that the influx of visitors would overwhelm the quiet neighborhood. Already showing the signs of age, the house had an exterior floodwater line from the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]], and some damage from an infestation of bees, but it has fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden]] in [[Coral Gables]], which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered.<ref name="conserving"/><ref>Smiley, David (September 2, 2007). "Douglas' next-door property now at issue." ''The Miami Herald''; State and Regional News.</ref> The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and as of 2007, it remained unoccupied and unused until a decision is made how to utilize it.
