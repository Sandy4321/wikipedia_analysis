'''Genesis Breyer P-Orridge''' (born February 22, 1950) is an [[England|English]] [[performer]], [[musician]], [[writer]] and [[artist]]. His early confrontational performance work in [[COUM Transmissions]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s along with the [[industrial music|industrial]] band [[Throbbing Gristle]], which dealt with subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], [[serial killer]]s, and [[occultism]], generated controversy. Later musical work with [[Psychic TV]] received wider exposure, including some chart-topping singles. Genesis P-Orridge is credited on over 200 releases.

He has two daughters, Caresse and Genesse, with his former wife and creative partner, [[Paula P-Orridge]] (aka Alaura O'Dell).

Genesis is now represented by the New York gallery, Invisible-Exports.

==Early life==
'''Neil Andrew Megson''' was born in [[Victoria Park, Manchester]]. His parents were involved in theatre and music. His father, Ron, was a [[Jazz]] musician who liked [[Bebop]] and [[Nat King Cole]].
A photograph of Neil, age five, appears on the cover of the CD ''A Hollow Cost''.

In his teens he attended [[Solihull School]]. He became interested in the [[occult]]; his grandmother was a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]]. The Megson family lived at the edge of [[Epping Forest]], in [[Loughton]], [[Essex]].

==Name change and Early Worm==
In 1968, while attending [[Hull University]],{{Verify source|date=July 2007}} Neil subsumed himself into the character of Genesis P-Orridge. He used the name for his first pressed recording, "Early Worm" in 1968 (of which only one copy was pressed), and legally changed his name in 1971. The follow-up to this album of [[improvisation]] on homemade instruments, "Catching the Bird" was never released.

At this point, the Megson family was living in [[Solihull]], a prosperous town near [[Birmingham]]. The attic of the house on Links Drive was not only P-Orridge's den but his first sound studio, where "Early Worm" was recorded.

According to Genesis P-Orridge, Deroy Sound, the lab where "Early Worm" was pressed, also pressed speeches of [[Adolf Hitler]] for [[serial killer]] [[Ian Brady]], recorded from radio and television by Brady.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} The
[[Throbbing Gristle]] song ''Very Friendly'' is about Brady and his partner-in-crime [[Myra Hindley]].

The cover of "Early Worm" features handwritten quotes by [[John Cage]], his book ''Silence'' being a source of inspiration for Genesis P-Orridge.

In April 2008, American record label [http://www.daisrecords.com/ Dais Records] released "Thee Early Worm" LP for the first time ever in a limited pressing of 500 copies, digitally transferred from the original tape and mastered for vinyl, with liner notes written by Genesis P-Orridge.

==1971 to 1976==
In 1971, P-Orridge met [[William S. Burroughs]] after a brief correspondence. One of the most significant outcomes of these exchanges was Burroughs's introduction of P-Orridge to [[Brion Gysin]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Gysin would become a major influence upon P-Orridge's ideas and works and was his primary tutor in [[magick]]. (P-Orridge, 2003)

P-Orridge dropped out of the [[University of Hull]] in 1969 and joined [[Exploding Galaxy]], a commune in [[London]]'s Islington Park Street. Members abandoned all normal modes of living, all notions of [[privacy]], and Britain's class structure. Discipline was expected and costumes were the norm, as was role-playing and a rejection of all forms of social convention.

He returned to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and formed a prankster collective which eventually included [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]]. {{Fact|date=October 2007}} Tutti and P-Orridge became the focus of COUM events and transformed COUM from a music and theatre operation into more of a [[performance art]] group with a focus on sex, taboos, and the paranormal. In 1973 they were joined by [[Hipgnosis]]'s [[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]].

Tutti worked as a secretary, [[stripper]], and pornographic and erotic model. The now infamous "Prostitution" show, in 1976 at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) in London included on display Tutti's pornographic images from magazines as well as erotic nude photographs. The show featured a stripper, used [[Procter & Gamble#Brands|Tampax]] in glass, and [[transvestism|transvestite]] guards. Prostitutes, [[Punk subculture|punk]]s, people in costumes, and general curiosities were hired to mingle with the gallery audience.

The show caused debate in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] about the public funding of such events. In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP Sir [[Nicholas Fairbairn]] demanded an explanation from Arts Minister [[Harold Lever]] and proclaimed P-Orridge and Tutti as "wreckers of civilisation". [[Fleet Street]] was not slow to pick up the story. The reviews were cut up, framed and put on display for the remainder of the exhibition. This was also reported in newspapers, so cut-ups about the cut-ups were also put on display. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

COUM had always been a confrontational enterprise, one example of this being the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-influenced visual element. Toward the end of COUM, performances would often consist of only P-Orridge, Cosey and Sleazy, the core group who went on to form [[Throbbing Gristle]].

==Throbbing Gristle==
[[Throbbing Gristle]] was formed on September 3, 1975 at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] as a four-piece [[rock band]].

The first Throbbing Gristle performance was at the Air Gallery in London on July 6, 1976. The band performed in one room with the music "appearing" in an adjacent room. Peter worked in [[special effects]] and provided the performers with simulated scars, and [[Chris Carter (musician)|Chris]] used a [[razor]] to slash himself.

At that point Throbbing Gristle headquarters was 10 Martello Street, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney, East London]], an address of an anti-[[West End of London|West End]] artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti's living and work space was the mailing address of [[Industrial Records]]. The IR logo was a faded, high-contrast black-and-white photograph of [[Auschwitz]]'s main ovens. The final [[Throbbing Gristle]] single was "Discipline".

The final IR release was called ''Nothing Here but the Recordings'', a best-of album taken from the archives of [[William S. Burroughs]], who had allowed P-Orridge and Sleazy access to his reel-to-reel tape archive.

The final TG event, ''Mission of Dead Souls'', was in May 1981 in San Francisco. Soon after, Genesis and [[Paula P-Orridge]] (n<U+00E9>e Alaura O'Dell) were married in [[Tijuana]].

==Psychic TV==
[[Psychic TV]] was formed in 1981, after  [[Alex Fergusson (musician)|Alex Fergusson]] of [[Alternative TV]] had encouraged P-Orridge to start something new. The musical collaboration between the two goes back to the very first ATV line-up, which included Genesis as [[drummer]]. According to the official P-Orridge and [[Voiceprint]] websites, the name was Fergusson's idea, with the "psychic" part representing P-Orridge and the "TV" part representing Fergusson. "Just Drifting" was the first PTV song, based on a poem by P-Orridge.

Psychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organized by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called ''The Final Academy''. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with [[literature]], performance, film and music. PTV, [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]], [[Z'EV]], [[John Giorno]], William S. Burroughs, [[Brion Gysin]], Terry Wilson, [[Jeff Nuttall]], and The Last Few Days participated to honor the cut-up techniques and theories of [[William S. Burroughs]], Ian Sommerville, Anthony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's [[Dreamachine|Dreammachine]] by the [[Hafler Trio]].

''[[Force the Hand of Chance]]'', ''[[Dreams Less Sweet]]'', ''[[Allegory and Self]]'', and ''[[Trip/Reset]]'' are considered by P-Orridge, in an interview with Sonic Envelope, to be the fully-realized PTV albums -- "metaphorical and very, very considered and carefully constructed meticulous albums."

Earning an entry into the [[Guinness Book Of World Records]] for most records released in a year by a musical group, Psychic TV set about, in the mid-eighties, to release 23 live albums on the 23rd of each month for 23 months in recognition of [[the 23 enigma]]. The liner notes to each of these releases functioned somewhat like mini-manifestos in the tradition of the Situationist International or [[William S. Burroughs]]'
''Electronic Revolution'' in addition to recounting aspects of the recordings contained therein. For example, the fourth album in this series, ''[[Live In Reykjavik|Live In Reykjav<U+00ED>k]]'', featuring part of a ritual from Godhi [[Sveinbj<U+00F6>rn Beinteinsson]] includes liner notes that refer to [[Christianity]] as "sham X-tianity," in reclamation of a [[Paganism|Pagan]] heritage via an [[<U+00C1>satr<U+00FA>]] marriage, over which Beinteinsson presided, below a statue of [[Thor]] in "thee wilderness".

Psychic TV returned to the stage in 2003, with a concert in New York under the guise of PTV3 and was accompanied by (with the exception of Genesis) an all new line-up. In September 2004, an extensive tour of Europe (covering 16 countries) and North America was launched. 2005 saw the band return to the studio, recording their first album in over 10 years (Genesis also spent 2005 working with [[Throbbing Gristle]] on what will be their first album in over 25 years).

In January 2006, the new PTV album was announced on his website. [[Hell is Invisible... Heaven is Her/e]] was recorded in NYC and features [[Nick Zinner]] ([[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]) and [[Gibby Haynes]] ([[Butthole Surfers]]) guesting on some tracks. Genesis describes it as "[[Dark Side of the Moon]] for the 21st century". To inaugurate the release of Hell is Invisible... Heaven is Her/e, PTV3 hosted a five night residency in September 2006 at Galapagos Art Space in [[Brooklyn|Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York]].On August the 17th [http://www.genesisp-orridge.com/index.php?section=news&id=125&album_id=1 a new album was announced], "Mr. Alien Brain Vs. The Skinwalkers" will be released by Cargo/Sweet Nothing Records on October 20, 2008.

==Recent life==
Genesis relocated to Brooklyn, [[New York City]] with his second wife, Lady Jaye, n<U+00E9>e Jacqueline Breyer, and he began an ongoing experiment in body modification aimed at creating one [[pandrogynous]] being named "Genesis Breyer P-Orridge". {{Fact|date=October 2007}}Genesis P-Orridge received [[breast implants]] and began referring to himself as ''[[Gender-neutral pronoun|s/he]]''. A book of GP-O writings, poems and observations was published in [[Nepal]].

In the mid-1990s, GP-O collaborated with different people in music, including [[Pigface]] and [[Skinny Puppy]]. GP-O also performed with [[Nik Turner]] and a reinvention of [[Hawkwind]], a band with whom he'd shared bills in the early 1970s. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In June 1998, GP-O won a $1.5 million lawsuit against producer [[Rick Rubin]] and his [[American Recordings]] label for injuries he sustained while trying to escape a fire at Rubin's home in April, 1995.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/350146/06121998/psychic_tv.jhtml Genesis P-Orridge wins $1.5 million suit against Rick Rubin] from [[VH1|VH1.com]]</ref> According to P-Orridge's attorney, David D. Stein, P-Orridge was staying at Rubin's home as a guest of [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]] when the fire broke out. P-Orridge tried to escape the house by crawling through a second-story window and fell onto concrete stairs. P-Orridge suffered a broken wrist, broken ribs and a [[pulmonary embolism]], as well as a shattered left elbow that will prevent him from playing guitar or keyboards, according to Stein. The jury found that the liability for the fire rested with Rubin and American Recordings and awarded P-Orridge $1,572,000 for his injuries.

In 1999, Genesis performed with the briefly reunited late 1980s' version of Psychic TV for an event at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]], called ''Time's Up''.  This is also the title of the first CD by [[Thee Majesty]], Genesis' spoken word project with noise guitarist Bryin Dall. The MC for the event, via pre-recorded video, was [[Quentin Crisp]]. A DVD was made of this event, which included the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]], [[Question Mark & the Mysterians]], [[Billy Childish]], and [[Thee Headcoats]].

The aforementioned Thee Majesty CD ''Time's Up'' was released by The Order of the Suffering Clown via [[World Serpent Distribution]].  Jaqueline Megson is credited as providing ''Point Of View'', Bryin Dall for ''Frequency Of Truth'' and Genesis as ''Divination Of Word''.

In December 2003, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, calling himself ''Djinn'', unveiled PTV3, a new act drawing upon the early "Hyperdelic" work of Psychic TV with media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] among its members. On May 16, 2004 all four former members of Throbbing Gristle performed at the [[London Astoria]] for the first time in 23 years.

Genesis P-Orridge appears in the 1998 film and 2000 book versions of ''[[Modulations]]'', in the 1999 film [[Better Living Through Circuitry]], in the 2004 film ''[[DiG!]]'', the 2006 documentary [[Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback]], and in Nik Sheehan's 2007 feature documentary on the [[Dreamachine]] entitled 'FLicKeR'.

On October 11, 2007, it was announced that Lady Jaye had died. This message was posted on the official Genesis P-Orridge website:
{{quote|"Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and her reactivated Psychic TV aka PTV3 are terribly sad to announce the cancellation of their November North American tour dates. This decision is entirely due to the unexpected passing of band member Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge. Lady Jaye died suddenly on Tuesday 9th October 2007 at home in Brooklyn, New York from a previously undiagnosed heart condition which is thought to have been connected with her long-term battle with stomach cancer. Lady Jaye collapsed and died in the arms of her heartbroken "other half" Genesis Breyer P-Orridge."<ref>[http://www.genesisp-orridge.com/index.php?section=news&id=111&album_id=1 Genesis P-Orridge - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

Psychic TV's current incarnation, PTV3, has recently released the new CD/DVD set, Mr. Alien Brain vs. The Skinwalkers. The album, which was released on December 9, 2008, was the first full length release since the death of Genesis' "other half," Jaye Breyer (best known as Lady Jaye), due to heart failure. The two had previously embarked on a years-long pursuit of pandrogyny, undergoing painful plastic surgery procedures in order to become gender-neutral human beings that looked like each other<ref>{{cite web
