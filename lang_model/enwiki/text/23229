[[Knight Bachelor|Sir]] '''Robert William Robson''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born [[February 18]] [[1933]], in [[Sacriston]], [[County Durham]], [[England]]), commonly known as '''Bobby Robson''' ([[IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+02C8>b<U+0252>bi <U+02C8><U+0279><U+0252>bs(<U+0259>)n]}}), is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[coach (sports)|manager]] and former international football player.  As an [[Football_%28soccer%29_positions#Deep-lying_forward_.28SS.29|inside-forward]], his professional playing career spanned nearly 20 years during which he played for just three clubs, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Vancouver Royals]]. He also made 20 appearances for [[England national football team|England]], scoring four goals. 

He achieved success as both a club and international manager, having won league championships in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Portugal]], earning trophies in [[England]] and [[Spain]], and taking England to the semi-final of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. He is currently a mentor to the manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish national football team]].

Robson was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 2002, is a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] and is the honorary president of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He has, since 1991, had recurrent medical problems with [[cancer]], and in May 2007 revealed that he had cancerous nodules in his lungs: he vowed to "battle as I've always done" against the illness.

==Early life==
Born in [[Sacriston]], [[County Durham]], Robson was the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (n<U+00E9>e Watt).<ref>{{cite book

Following the 1958 World Cup, Robson became an established member of the England squad, enjoying considerable success in a period between October 1960 and March 1961 when he played in six England victories, including a record 9&ndash;3 defeat of Scotland at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite book
