'''Emma Thompson''' (born 15 April 1959) is a British actress, screenwriter and author. Cited as one of the greatest British actresses of her generation,<ref name="Ingersoll2012"/><ref name="Sands"/> she is known for her portrayal of reticent women in period dramas and literary adaptations, often playing haughty or matronly characters with a sense of irony. 

Born in [[Paddington]], London to English actor [[Eric Thompson]] and Scottish actress [[Phyllida Law]], she was educated at [[Camden School for Girls]] and [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge]], where she became the first female member of the [[Footlights]] troupe. After appearing in several comedy programmes, she first came to prominence in 1987 in two BBC TV series, ''[[Tutti Frutti (1987 TV series)|Tutti Frutti]]'' and ''[[Fortunes of War (TV series)|Fortunes of War]]'', winning the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress]] for her work in both. Her first film role was opposite [[Jeff Goldblum]] in the 1989 romantic comedy ''[[The Tall Guy]]'', and the early 1990s she frequently collaborated with then-husband actor and director [[Kenneth Branagh]], appearing on stage together in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]'' and in films like ''[[Dead Again]]'' (1991), ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' (1992) and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (1993 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1993). 

In 1992, Thompson won multiple acting awards, including an [[Academy Award]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] Award for Best Actress, for her performance as the bourgeois lady Margaret Schlegel in the British drama ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]''. In 1993, Thompson garnered dual Academy Award nominations, as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her roles as stately home housekeeper Miss Kenton opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]] in ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' and as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her portrayal of a campaigning lawyer [[Gareth Peirce]] alongside [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] in ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]''. In 1995, Thompson scripted and starred in ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'', a film adaptation of the [[Jane Austen]] [[Sense and Sensibility|novel of the same name]], which earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] among [[List of accolades received by Sense and Sensibility (film)|other awards]]. Other notable film and television credits have included her role  as the eccentric professor [[Sybill Trelawney]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']] film series, ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003), ''[[Angels in America (TV miniseries)|Angels in America]]'' (2003), ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'' (2005), ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' (2006), ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' (2008), ''[[An Education]]'' (2009), ''[[Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang]]'' (2010), ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012), and as writer [[P. L. Travers]] in ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]'' (2013), which earned her a BAFTA  nomination.  

Thompson met Kenneth Branagh in 1987 while filming ''Fortunes of War'' and married him two years later. Dubbed a "golden couple" by the British media, the relationship received considerable press interest until they announced their separation in September 1995. She remarried [[Greg Wise]] in 2003, giving birth to a daughter, Gaia, in 1999. The family's permanent residence is in [[West Hampstead]], London, on the same road that Thompson lived in her youth. She has been outspoken on issues such as religion, politics, the environment and human rights, and is a supporter of [[Greenpeace]], ambassador for the charity [[ActionAid]], and patron of the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] and  [[Refugee Council]].  In 2012, Thompson authored ''The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit'' to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''.

The brief comedy series '' [[There's Nothing To Worry About!]]'' (1982) was their first outing, followed by the one-off show ''[[The Crystal Cube]]'' (1982).<ref name="bfi">{{cite web|title=Emma Thompson|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba1c2f296|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref> The sketch show ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'' (1983<U+2013>84) proved more successful, and ran for two series.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="bfi"/> In 1985, Thompson was cast in the [[West End theatre|West End]] revival of the musical ''[[Me and My Girl]]'', co-starring [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]].

Thompson's first big-screen appearance came in the romantic comedy ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' (1989),<ref name="yahoo"/> the feature-film debut from screenwriter [[Richard Curtis]].

===1990-93: A leading British actress===
Thompson and Branagh are considered by American writer and critic [[James Monaco]] to have led the "British cinematic onslaught" in the 1990s.<ref name="Monaco2009">{{cite book|last=Monaco|first=James|title=How to Read a Film:Movies, Media, and Beyond: Movies, Media, and Beyond|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bgbOsjnppAcC&pg=PA414|date=8 May 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975579-0|page=414}}</ref>
Thompson continued to experiment with Shakespeare in the new decade, appearing with Branagh in his stage productions of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.<ref name="yahoo"/><ref name="rtc"/> Reviewing the latter, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' praised her "extraordinary" performance of the "hobbling, stooped hunchback [[Shakespearean fool|Fool]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Christiansen, Richard|title=An Impressive `King Lear` Outshines A Flawed, Hilarious `dream`|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-05-25/news/9002130021_1_king-lear-pyramus-and-thisbe-actors|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=25 May 1990|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref> Thompson returned to cinema in 1991, playing a "frivolous aristocrat"<ref name="nyt"/> in ''[[Impromptu (1991 film)|Impromptu]]'', a period drama about the life of [[George Sand]] that starred [[Judy Davis]] and [[Hugh Grant]].

A turning point in Thompson's career<ref name="yahoo"/> came when she was cast opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]] period drama ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' (1992), based on [[Howards End|the novel]] by [[E.

The film explored the social class system in [[Edwardian England]], with Thompson playing an idealistic, intellectual, forward-looking woman who comes into association with a privileged, moneyed, deeply conservative family. According to the critic [[Vincent Canby]], the role allowed Thompson to "[come] into her own", away from Branagh, and he felt that she gave "the film's guiding performance".<ref>{{cite news|title=Howards End (1992)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0DD1738F930A25750C0A964958260|author=Canby, Vincent|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 March 1992|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that she was "superb in the central role: quiet, ironic, observant, with steel inside."<ref>{{cite news|title=Howards End|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/howards-end-1992|author=Ebert, Roger|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1 May 1992|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> ''Howards End'' was widely praised,<ref>{{cite web|title=Howards End|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Howards_End/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> a "surprise hit",<ref name="simply">{{cite news|title=Simply Put, It's Chemistry : Two actors, two Oscars, two tart tongues<U+2014>Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins do the Tracy and Hepburn thing|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-31/entertainment/ca-51533_1_emma-thompson-and-anthony-hopkins|author=De Vries, Hilary|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 October 1993|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> and received nine [[Academy Award]] nominations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Howards End (1992)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/23747/Howards-End/overview|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> Among its three wins was the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] trophy for Thompson, who was also awarded a [[Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA]] for her performance.<ref name="nyt"/> Reflecting on the role, ''The New York Times'' writes that the actress "found herself an international success almost overnight."<ref name="nyt"/>

===1994-98: ''Sense and Sensibility'' and Hollywood acclaim===
In 1994, Thompson made her [[Hollywood]] debut playing a goofy doctor alongside [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Danny DeVito]] in the blockbuster ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]''. Although the male pregnancy storyline and script was poorly received by most critics,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058426-junior |title=Junior |publisher= Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' mentioned that Thompson had the opportunity to demonstrate her slapstick skills as a comedian for American audiences by portraying the clumsy scientist in the film. She returned to [[independent film|independent cinema]] for a lead role in ''[[Carrington (film)|Carrington]]'', which studied the platonic relationship between artist [[Dora Carrington]] and writer [[Lytton Strachey]] (played by [[Jonathan Price]]). Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had "developed a specialty in unrequited love",<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Carrington|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/carrington-1995|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=17 November 1995}}</ref> and the ''TV Guide Film & Video Companion'' commented that her "neurasthenic mannerisms, which usually drive us batty, are appropriate here".<ref name="Books2004">{{cite book|title=TV Guide Film & Video Companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gNEdYxQM_hkC|year=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|isbn=978-0-7607-6104-5|page=146}}</ref>

Thompson was absent from screens in 1996, but returned the following year with [[Alan Rickman]]'s directorial debut, ''[[The Winter Guest]]''.

===2000s: Smaller roles===

[[File:EmmaThompson05.jpg|thumb|left|Thompson at the London premiere of ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'', 2005]]

When she became a mother in 1999, Thompson made a conscious decision to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles.<ref name="bafta"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Simon, Jeff|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1827973.html|title=THE IoS PROFILE: Emma Thompson|publisher=''The Independent on Sunday'', accessed via HighBeam Research {{subscription}}|date=8 February 2004|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with only a small part in the British comedy ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'', which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend [[Ben Elton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ben Elton live on our talkboards|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/30/2|accessdate=1 February 2014|work=The Guardian|date=30 May 2000}}</ref>

For the [[HBO]] television film ''[[Wit (film)|Wit]]'' (2001), however, Thompson happily took the lead role in what she felt was "one of the best scripts to have come out of America".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirwan|first=Sian|title=Interview with Emma Thompson|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/08/30/emma_thompson_wit_2001_interview.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=August 2001}}</ref> Adapted from [[Margaret Edson]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning [[Wit (play)|play]], it focusses on a [[Harvard University]] professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]].

Thompson's only credit of 2002 was a [[voice acting|vocal performance]] in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', an adaptation of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', where she voiced Captain Amelia.
