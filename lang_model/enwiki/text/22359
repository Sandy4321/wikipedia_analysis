"Du'n Dati" is a parody of Iglesia Ni Cristo's "Ang Mga Nagsi-alis sa Samahang Ang Dating Daan". There is a running gag that Kapatid na Auring answers ''"wala"'' every time she is asked by Kapatid na Toto if there are any additional comments to the topic being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Dating Doon-Bubble Gang|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXfXUE0PAS4|website=YouTube}}</ref>

For 2011 onwards, the sketch has been renamed "Ang Bagong Dating Doon", focusing on questions or opinions from the other ''Bubble Gang'' cast members and through social media sites, answering them by the hosts through song lyrics, meanwhile being interpreted by Brod Pete in a more humorous way. The sketch incorporates new technologies by using [[Macbook]] laptops and [[iPad]]s as reference materials, being shown using [[Facebook]] as references and sometimes playing games, most notably [[Temple Run]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ang Dating Doon-Bubble Gang|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXfXUE0PAS4|website=YouTube}}</ref>
