'''Pennsylvania Route 52''' ('''PA 52''') is a {{convert|11.8|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[state highway]] located in southeast [[Pennsylvania]]. The southern terminus of the route is at the Pennsylvania-[[Delaware]] state line near [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], where PA 52 continues as [[Delaware Route 52]] (DE 52). The northern terminus is at [[U.S. Route 322 Business (West Chester, Pennsylvania)|U.S. Route 322 Business]] (US 322 Bus.) in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]]. Near the [[Kennett Township, Pennsylvania|Kennett Township]] community of Longwood, it has about a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} wrong-way [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|US 1]]. PA 52 passes through suburban and rural areas along its route.

PA 52 was first designated by 1928, continuing northeast from West Chester to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]] along a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 122 (1926)|US 122]] (later [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|US 202]]). This concurrency was removed by 1930 and the northern terminus of PA 52 was cut back to its current location in West Chester. In 2011, a portion of PA 52 north of US 1 was realigned.

==Route description==
PA 52 begins at the [[Delaware]] border in [[Pennsbury Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Pennsbury Township]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], at which point the road continues south into Delaware as [[Delaware Route 52|DE 52]]. From the state line, the road heads north-northwest on two-lane undivided Kennett Pike through wooded residential areas. The road crosses into [[Kennett Township, Pennsylvania|Kennett Township]] and heads northwest to the community of [[Mendenhall, Pennsylvania|Mendenhall]], where it crosses an [[East Penn Railroad]] line. Farther northwest, PA 52 comes to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|US 1]] ([[Baltimore Pike]]) and turns west to form a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with that route, which is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that passes fields. Near [[Longwood Gardens]], PA 52 splits from US 1 by heading north on Lenape Road. The road runs a short distance east of the border between [[East Marlborough Township, Pennsylvania|East Marlborough Township]] to the west and Pennsbury Township to the east as it passes through a mix of woods and fields, intersecting [[Pennsylvania Route 926|PA 926]].<ref name=gm>{{google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=DE+52+and+PA+52&daddr=high+street+and+PA+52&hl=en&geocode=FR7KXwIdVwZ--ynfbx78W_nGiTEMlz0RL-aTCQ%3BFV2tYQIdam5--ymb2k1iQPHGiTFPOPsApvilVw&mra=ls&sll=39.847325,-75.487125&sspn=0.030049,0.084543&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11|title=overview of Pennsylvania Route 52|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref><ref name=PennDOTChester>{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]]|title=Chester County, Pennsylvania Highway Map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/chester_GHSN.PDF|year=2010|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref>

Past this intersection, the road passes through forested residential areas, crossing into [[Pocopson Township, Pennsylvania|Pocopson Township]] as it winds more to the northeast. In the community of [[Lenape, Pennsylvania|Lenape]], PA 52 crosses another East Penn Railroad line prior to crossing the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] into [[Birmingham Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|Birmingham Township]]. Here, the road turns northwest onto Creek Road (the old alignment of [[Pennsylvania Route 100|PA 100]]) prior to continuing northeast along Lenape Road into [[East Bradford Township, Pennsylvania|East Bradford Township]]. The route passes through areas of woods, fields, and housing developments prior to intersecting West Rosedale Avenue. At this point, PA 52 heads northwest on Bradford Avenue, forming the border between East Bradford Township to the west and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] to the east, passing homes. The route makes a turn northeast onto Price Street, fully entering West Chester, where it continues through residential areas. The route comes to its northern terminus at [[U.S. Route 322 Business (West Chester, Pennsylvania)|US 322 Bus.]] (South High Street) a short distance north of the [[West Chester University]] campus. At this intersection, the old alignment of PA 100 turned left onto High Street.<ref name=gm/><ref name=PennDOTChester/>

==History==
When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what would become PA 52 was legislated as Legislative Route 134 between the Delaware border and West Chester, Legislative Route 143 between West Chester and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], Legislative Route 178 between Norristown and [[Buckingham, Pennsylvania|Buckingham]], and Legislative Route 155 between Buckingham and [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]].<ref name="PennDOT 1911">{{cite map|publisher=[[Pennsylvania Department of Highways]]|title=Map of Pennsylvania Showing State Highways| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1911.pdf|year=1911|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> PA 52 was first designated by 1928 to run from the Delaware border northeast to the [[New Jersey]] border in New Hope, following its current routing to West Chester, where it reached an intersection with [[U.S. Route 122 (1926)|US 122]] at High Street. PA 52 ran concurrent with US 122 between West Chester and New Hope by way of [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]], Norristown, [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]], [[Chalfont, Pennsylvania|Chalfont]], [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], and Buckingham.<ref name=1928map>{{cite map|url=http://www.mapsofpa.com/art5pics/1928phila3.jpg|title=Pennsylvania Highway Map (Philadelphia Metro)|year=1928|publisher=[[Gulf Oil]]|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}</ref> By 1930, the concurrency with US 122 (later [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|US 202]]) was removed, leaving the northern terminus at US 122 (High Street, now US 322 Bus.).<ref name="PennDOT 1930">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Tourist Map of Pennsylvania| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1930fr.pdf|year=1930|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> When first assigned, PA 52 ran concurrent with [[Pennsylvania Route 62 (1920s)|PA 62]] between Lenape and West Chester.<ref name=1928map/> By 1940, PA 62 was renumbered to [[Pennsylvania Route 100|PA 100]].<ref name="PennDOT 1940">{{cite map|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Highways|title=Official Road Map of Pennsylvania| url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/Statewide/Historic_OTMs/1940fr.pdf|year=1940|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}</ref> In 2003, the PA 100 concurrency was removed when the southern terminus of that route was cut back from the Delaware border to north of West Chester.<ref name=inq>{{cite news|last=Petersen|first=Nancy|date=October 9, 2003|title=Route 100 loses its way through West Chester|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|url=http://articles.philly.com/2003-10-09/news/25466049_1_dennis-tiley-truck-traffic-business-route|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>
