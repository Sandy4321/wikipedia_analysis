'''Bob Dylan''' (born '''Robert Allen Zimmerman''', [[May 24]], [[1941]]) is a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[author]], [[musician]], and [[poet]] who has been a major figure in [[popular music]] for five decades. Much of Dylan's most notable work dates from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest.

His most recent studio album, ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'', released on [[August 29]], [[2006]], entered the U.S. album charts at #1, making him, at age 65, the oldest living person to top those charts.{{fact|date=May 2007}}<!--Was he the oldest ever?-->

Dylan's early lyrics incorporated [[politics]], [[social commentary]], [[philosophy]] and [[literature|literary]] influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the [[counterculture]] of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, he has shown steadfast devotion to many traditions of American song, from [[folk music|folk]] and [[American country music|country]]/[[blues]] to [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]], to English, Scottish and Irish folk music, even [[jazz]], [[swing (genre)|swing]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[hard rock]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. 

Dylan performs with the [[guitar]], [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] and [[harmonica]]. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the "[[Never Ending Tour]]". He has also performed alongside other major artists, such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Simon]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[U2]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Jack White]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Neil Young]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Van Morrison]], [[George Harrison]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Eric Clapton]].  Although his accomplishments as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally regarded to be his greatest contribution.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/time100/artists/profile/dylan.html

His career accomplishments include the [[Polar Music Prize]], the [[Grammy]] [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], [[Kennedy Center Honors]], and induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame|Nashville Songwriters]] and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].

==Biography== 
===Origins and musical beginnings===
[[Image:BobDylanHSPhoto.jpg|left|thumb|Robert Zimmerman in high school]]
'''Robert Allen Zimmerman''' (Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham)<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', p.14</ref> was born on [[May 24]], [[1941]], in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Minnesota]], and raised there and in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], on the [[Mesabi Iron Range]] northwest of [[Lake Superior]]. His grandparents were [[Jewish]] immigrants from present-day [[Turkey]] and [[Russia]].  In his 2004 autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'', he wrote that his paternal grandmother's maiden name was [[Kirghiz]] and her family originated from [[Istanbul]], although she grew up in the [[Ka<U+011F><U+0131>zman]] district of [[Kars]] in Eastern [[Turkey]]. His paternal grandfather was from [[Trabzon]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Turkey]]. His paternal grandparents sailed from [[Trabzon]] to the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]] from where they took off to emigrate to America.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dylan |first=Bob |authorlink=Bob Dylan |title= "Chronicles, Volume One" |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=0306812312  |pages=92-93}}</ref>

His parents, Abraham Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone were both [[Jewish]], and their family was part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community. Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age seven. When his father was stricken with [[polio]], the family returned to nearby [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 25<U+2013>33</ref> Abraham was recalled by one of Bob's childhood friends as strict and unwelcoming, whereas his mother was remembered as warm and friendly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gill (with Kevin Odegard) |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Gill |title= "A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks" |year=2004 |publisher=[[Da Capo]] |isbn=0743230760  |pages=99}}</ref>

Zimmerman spent much of his youth listening to the radio <U+2014> first to the powerful [[blues]] and [[American country music|country]] stations broadcasting from [[Shreveport]] and, later, to early [[rock and roll]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 38<U+2013>39.</ref> He formed several bands in high school. The first, The Shadow Blasters, was short-lived.  The next band, The Golden Chords, lasted longer and played covers: their performance of [[Danny and the Juniors]]' "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" at their high school talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone off.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 29<U+2013>37</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.expectingrain.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=14416

Zimmerman enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]] in September 1959 and moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]. His early focus on rock and roll gave way to an interest in American folk music, typically performed with an acoustic guitar. He has recalled, "The first thing that turned me onto folk singing was [[Odetta]]. I heard a record of hers in a record store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson".<ref>[http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/play78.htm ''Playboy'' interview with Bob Dylan, March 1978]</ref> He may have taken guitar lessons with Marvin Karlins at the University of Minnesota.<ref>''Romancing the Clock'', Marvin Karlins; Chapter 4, page 30</ref>  He soon began to perform at the 10 O'clock Scholar, a coffee house a few blocks from campus, and became actively involved in the local [[Dinkytown, USA|Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit,   fraternizing with local folk enthusiasts and occasionally "borrowing" many of their albums.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 65<U+2013>82</ref><ref>''[[No Direction Home]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]]. Directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. Released [[July 21]] [[2005]].</ref>

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan". In his autobiography, ''Chronicles'' (2004), he wrote: "What I was going to do as soon as I left home was just call myself Robert Allen.... It sounded like a Scottish king and I liked it." However, by reading ''Downbeat'' magazine, he discovered that there was already a saxophonist called David Allyn. A little later he became acquainted with the work of writer [[Dylan Thomas]] and made a choice between Robert Allyn and Robert Dylan: "I couldn't decide <U+2014> the letter D came on stronger" he explained. He decided on "Bob" because there were several Bobbies in popular music at the time.<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 78<U+2013>79.</ref>

===Relocation to New York and record deal===

Dylan quit college at the end of his freshman year.  He stayed in Minneapolis, working the folk circuit there with temporary journeys in [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Madison, Wisconsin]]; and [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. In January 1961, he headed for [[New York City]] to perform and to visit his ailing musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]] in a New Jersey [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital|hospital]]. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and was the biggest influence on his early performances.  Dylan would later say of Guthrie's work, "You could listen to his songs and actually learn how to live."<ref>''[[No Direction Home]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]]. Directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. Released [[July 21]] [[2005]].</ref>  In the hospital room, Dylan also met Woody's old road-buddy [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] visiting Guthrie the day after returning from his trip to Europe. He and Elliott became friends, and much of Guthrie's repertoire was actually channeled through Elliott.  Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1|Chronicles]]'' (2004).<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 250<U+2013>252.</ref>

After initially playing mostly in small "basket" clubs for little pay, Dylan gained some public recognition after a positive review<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref>  His performances, like those on his first Columbia album ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' (1962), consisted of familiar folk, blues and [[gospel music|gospel]] material combined with some of his own songs. As Dylan continued to record for Columbia, he recorded more than a dozen songs for ''[[Broadside Magazine]]'', a folk music magazine and record label, under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt. In August 1962, he went to the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] building in New York and changed his name to Robert Dylan. 

By the time Dylan's next record, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', was released in 1963, he had begun to make his name as both a singer and a songwriter. Many of the songs on this album were labelled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 138<U+2013>142</ref> "Oxford Town," for example, was a sardonic account of [[James Meredith]]'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 156</ref>

His most famous song of the time, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", partially derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song "No More Auction Block", while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo. The song was widely recorded and became an international hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], setting a precedent for other artists. While Dylan's topical songs solidified his early reputation, ''Freewheelin''' also included a mixture of love songs and jokey, surreal talking blues. Humor was a large part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, ''Bob Dylan'', 35</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed many listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude <U+2014> it was incredibly original and wonderful."<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993</ref> 

The ''Freewheelin''' song "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", built melodically from a loose adaptation of the stanza tune of the folk [[ballad]] "[[Lord Randall]]", with its veiled references to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] [[apocalypse]], gained even more resonance as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Cuban missile crisis]] developed only a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 101<U+2013>103</ref> Like "Blowin' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" marked an important new direction in modern songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagist]] lyrical attack with traditional folk progressions.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 329<U+2013>44.</ref>
 
[[Image:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|With [[Joan Baez]] during the Civil Rights March in [[Washington, D.C.]], 1963]]
Soon after the release of ''Freewheelin'', Dylan emerged as a dominant figure of the so-called "new folk movement" headquartered in [[Greenwich Village]].  As an interpreter of traditional songs, Dylan's singing voice was untrained (which is not uncommon for popular singers), and also quite unusual ([[Don McLean]]'s [[American Pie]] calls it "a voice that came from you and me").  [[Robert Shelton]] described Dylan's style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s"<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 108<U+2013>111</ref>  Many of his most famous early songs first reached the public through versions by other performers who were more immediately palatable.   While Dylan was not trying to perform ''[[sprechgesang]]'' (nor was it likely Dylan was aware of the obscure song form), his singing voice has been described as such.<ref>http://www.n-b-u.de/show_hamburg.htm Bob Dylan in Hamburg Germany</ref> <ref>http://www.filmzentrale.com/rezis/nodirectionhomeub.htm No Direction Home: Bob Dylan</ref>  [[Joan Baez]] became Dylan's advocate, as well as his lover.  Baez jumpstarted Dylan's performance career by inviting him onstage during her concerts, and recorded several of his early songs; she was influential in bringing Dylan to national and international prominence. 

Others who recorded and released his songs around this time included [[The Byrds]]; [[Sonny and Cher]]; [[The Hollies]]; [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; [[Manfred Mann]]; [[The Brothers Four]]; [[Judy Collins]] and [[The Turtles]], most attempting to impart more of a pop feel and rhythm to the songs where Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk pieces keying rhythmically off the vocals. These covers were so ubiquitous by the mid-1960s that [[CBS]] started to promote him with the tag "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan".

===Protest and ''Another Side of''===
By 1963, Dylan and Baez were both prominent in the [[civil rights]] movement, singing together at rallies including the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] where [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave his "[[I have a dream]]" speech.<ref>Dylan performed [[Only a Pawn in Their Game]] and [[When the Ship Comes In]]</ref>  In January, Dylan appeared on [[British television]] in the [[BBC]] play '' [[Madhouse on Castle Street]]'', playing the part of a "hobo guitar-player".<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> His next album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]'', reflected a more sophisticated, politicized and cynical Dylan.  This bleak material, addressing such subjects as the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]] and the despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities ("Ballad of Hollis Brown", "[[North Country Blues]]"), was accompanied by two love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings", and the renunciation of "Restless Farewell". The [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" describes the true story of a young socialite's ([[William Zantzinger]]) killing of a hotel maid ([[Hattie Carroll]]). Though never explicitly mentioning their respective races, the song leaves no doubt that the killer is white and the victim is black.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 221<U+2013>233</ref> 

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk-protest movement. Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee at a ceremony shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], a drunken, rambling Dylan questioned the role of the committee, insulted its members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself (and of every man) in assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 200<U+2013>205</ref>

His next album, ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', recorded on a single June evening in 1964, had a lighter mood than its predecessor.  The surreal Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free #10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare", accompanied by a sense of humor that has often reappeared over the years. "Spanish Harlem Incident" and "To Ramona" are, unusually for Dylan at the time, non-ironic love songs, while "I Don't Believe You" suggests the rock and roll soon to dominate in Dylan's music. "It Ain't Me Babe," on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a thinly disguised rejection of the role his reputation thrust at him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets elements of social commentary against a denser metaphorical landscape in a style later characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images"; and "[[My Back Pages]]," which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 160<U+2013>161 [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] sang harmony on the [[Another Side of Bob Dylan]] version of [[Mr. Tambourine Man]].</ref>

In 1964<U+2013>65 Dylan<U+2019>s appearance changed rapidly, as he made his move from leading contemporary song-writer of the folk scene to rock<U+2019>n<U+2019>roll star.  His scruffy jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe. A London reporter wrote: <U+201C>Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo.<U+201D><ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 267<U+2013>271, 288<U+2013>291</ref> Dylan also began to play with frequently hapless interviewers in increasingly cruel and surreal ways. Appearing on the [[Les Crane]] TV show and asked about a movie he was planning to make, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie. Asked if he played the cowboy, Dylan replied. <U+201C>No, I play my mother.<U+201D><ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 178<U+2013>181</ref> 

===Dylan goes electric===

His March 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' was yet another stylistic leap.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 181<U+2013>182</ref> Influenced by [[The Animals]] (whose recording of "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" was racing up the U.S. charts),<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 172<U+2013>174</ref> and the rock and roll of his youth, the album featured his first significant up-tempo rock songs.  The first single, "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]'s "Too Much Monkey Business" and was provided with an early [[music video]] courtesy of [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s [[cin<U+00E9>ma v<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>]] presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of [[England]], ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 68<U+2013>69</ref> Its free association lyrics both harked back to the manic energy of Beat poetry and were a forerunner of rap and hip-hop.<ref>Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', 144</ref>  In 1969, the militant [[Weatherman (organization)|Weatherman]] group took their name from a line in "Subterranean Homesick Blues" ("You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows").

The [[B side]] of the album was a different matter, including four lengthy acoustic songs whose undogmatic political, social and personal concerns are illuminated with the semi-mystical imagery that became another trademark.  One of these songs, "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", had already been a hit for The Byrds, yet written by Bob Dylan, albeit in a truncated form, while "Gates of Eden", "[[It's All Over Now Baby Blue]]", and "[[It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]" have been fixtures in Dylan's live performances for most of his career.

That summer Dylan made history by performing his first electric set (since his high school days) with a pickup group drawn mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), Sam Lay (drums), Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano), while [[Headliner (concert)|headlining]] at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] (see ''[[The electric Dylan controversy]]'').<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 208<U+2013>216</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport twice before, in 1963 and 1964, and two wildly divergent accounts of the crowd's response in 1965 emerged. The settled fact is that Dylan, met with a mix of cheering and booing, left the stage after only three songs. As one version of the legend has it, the boos were from the outraged folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by his electric guitar. An alternative account claims audience members were merely upset by poor sound quality and a surprisingly short set. Whatever sparked the crowd's disfavor, Dylan soon reemerged and sang two much better received solo acoustic numbers, "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" and "Mr. Tambourine Man", although his choice of the former has often been described as a carefully selected death knell for the kind of consciously sociopolitical, purely acoustic music that the cat-callers were demanding of him, with "New Folk" in the role of "Baby Blue".

An added significance of Dylan's 1965 Newport performance was that it provoked an outraged response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, ''No Direction Home'', 305<U+2013>314</ref> [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote in [[Sing Out!]]: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside traditions formulated over time...  But what of Bobby Dylan?...  Only a non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel." On July 29th, just four days after his controversial performance at Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York recording "Positively 4th Street". The song teemed  with images of paranoia and revenge ("I know the reason/That you talk behind my back/I used to be among the crowd/You're in with"), and was widely interpreted as Dylan's put-down of former friends from the folk community, friends he had known in the clubs along West 4th Street.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 186</ref>  

Many in the folk revival had embraced the idea that life equaled art, that a certain kind of life defined by suffering and social exclusion in fact replaced art.<ref>Georgina Boyes: The Imagined Village: Culture, ideology and the English Folk Revival</ref> Folksong collectors and singers often presented folk music as an innocent characteristic of lives lived without reflection or the false consciousness of capitalism.<ref> Greil Marcus: The Old, Weird America, 28</ref>   This philosophy, both genteel and paternalistic, was ultimately what Dylan had run afoul of by 1965. But at an Austin press conference in September of that year, on the day of his first performance with [[Levon and the Hawks]], he described his music not as a pop charts-bound break with the past, but as <U+201C>historical-traditional music.<U+201D><ref> Alan Jacobs: <U+201C>The Songs Are My Lexicon<U+201D> http://www.bobdylan.com/etc/ajacobs.html </ref> Dylan later told interviewer [[Nat Hentoff]]: <U+201C>What folk music is... is based on myths and the Bible and plague and famine and all kinds of things like that which are nothing but mystery and you can see it in all the songs<U+2026>.All these songs about roses growing out of people<U+2019>s brains and lovers who are really geese and swans that turn into angels<U+2026>and seven years of this and eight years of that and it<U+2019>s all really something that nobody can touch.... (the songs) are not going to die.<U+201D><ref> Nat Hentoff, quoted in The Playboy Interview, March 1966; quoted in the Ralph J. Gleason interview, Ramparts, March 1966</ref> It was this mystical, living tradition of songs that served as the palette for ''Bringing It All Back Home'', but in a nod to changing times first openly displayed at Newport, electrically amplified instruments would now become part of the mix.

===''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde''===
In [[1965 in music|1965]] , Dylan released the single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]," and it was a huge hit in both the U.S. and the UK; at over six minutes, it also expanded the limits of songs played on hit radio. In 2005, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed it at number one on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.<ref>{{cite news

Titled after the road that led from Dylan's native Minnesota to the musical hotbed of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], the songs passed stylistically through the birthplace of blues, the [[Mississippi Delta]], and referenced a number of [[blues]] songs, including [[Fred McDowell|Mississippi Fred McDowell's]] "61 Highway". The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, with surreal litanies of the grotesque flavored by [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s blues guitar, a rhythm section and Dylan's obvious enjoyment of the sessions. The closing song, "[[Desolation Row]]", is an apocalyptic vision with references to many figures of [[Western culture]].
[[Image:Music blonde on blonde.jpg|thumb|150px|A mix of [[folk music]], [[rock and roll]] and Dylan's own brand of surrealism, ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966)<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 93<U+2013>95</ref> is often considered one of the finest recordings of American popular music.]] 

In support of the record, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts and set about assembling a band. [[Mike Bloomfield]] was unwilling to leave the Butterfield Band, so Dylan mixed [[Al Kooper]] and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew with bar-band stalwarts [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], best known for backing [[Ronnie Hawkins]]. In August 1965 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience who, Newport notwithstanding, still demanded the acoustic troubadour of previous years.  The band's reception on [[September 3]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more uniformly favorable.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 189<U+2013>90</ref> 

Neither Kooper nor Brooks wanted to tour with Dylan, and he was unable to lure his preferred band, a crew of west coast musicians best known for backing [[Johnny Rivers]], featuring guitarist [[James Burton]] and drummer [[Mickey Jones]], away from their regular commitments. Dylan then hired Robertson and Helm's full band, [[The Band|The Hawks]], for his tour group, and began a string of studio sessions with them in an effort to record the follow-up to ''Highway 61 Revisited''.

While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences on tour, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] had been trying to persuade Dylan to record in Nashville for some time. In February 1966 Dylan agreed and Johnston surrounded him with a cadre of top-notch session men. At Dylan's insistence, Robertson and Kooper came down from [[New York City]] to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 238<U+2013>243</ref> The Nashville sessions created what Dylan later called "that thin wild mercury sound" <U+2014> ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966). [[Al Kooper]] said the record was a masterpiece because it was "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville, and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.<ref>Gill, ''My Back Pages'', 95</ref>

For many critics, Dylan's mid-'60s trilogy of albums <U+2014> ''Bringing It All Back Home'', ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Blonde on Blonde'' <U+2014> represents one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century. In Mike Marqusee's words: "Between late 1964 and  the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console."<ref>Marqusee, ''Wicked Messenger'', 139</ref>   

Dylan undertook a "world tour" of [[Australia]] and [[Europe]] in the spring of 1966. Each show was split into two parts.  Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[harmonica]].  In the second half, backed by [[the Hawks]], he played high voltage electric music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and slowly handclapped. 

The tour culminated in a famously raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[England]] (officially released on CD in 1998 as ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert]]''). At the climax of the concert, [[John Cordwell|one fan]], angry with Dylan's electric sound, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" and Dylan responded, "I don't believe you... You're a liar!"  He turned to the band and, just within earshot of the microphone, said "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan's dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Scorsese's documentary [[No Direction Home]].</ref>  They then launched into the last song of the night with gusto <U+2014> "Like a Rolling Stone."

===Motorcycle crash and the late 1960s===

After his European tour, Dylan returned to [[New York]], but the pressures on him continued to increase.  His publisher was demanding a finished [[manuscript]] of the poem/novel ''[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].''  Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had already scheduled an extensive summer/fall concert tour.  On [[July 29]], [[1966]], while Dylan rode his [[Triumph Motorcycles|Triumph]] 500 [[motorcycle]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], its brakes locked, throwing him to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never fully disclosed, it was confirmed that he indeed broke his neck. Dylan took advantage of his extended convalescence to escape the pressures of stardom: "When I had that motorcycle accident ... I woke up and caught my senses, I realized that I was just workin' for all these leeches. And I really didn't want to do that."<ref>{{cite web

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began editing film footage of his 1966 tour in ''[[Eat the Document]]'', a rarely exhibited follow-up to ''Don't Look Back''. In 1967 he began recording music with the Hawks at his home and at the basement of the Hawks' nearby "Big Pink". The relaxed atmosphere yielded renditions of many of Dylan's favored old and new songs and some newly written pieces.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 222<U+2013>5</ref> These songs, initially compiled as demos for other artists to record, provided hit singles for [[Julie Driscoll]], [[The Byrds]], and [[Manfred Mann]].  Columbia belatedly released selections from them in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''. Later in 1967, the Hawks (soon to be rechristened as [[The Band]]) independently recorded the album ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', thus beginning a long and successful recording and performing career of their own.

In December 1967 Dylan released ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'', his first album since the motorcycle crash. It was a quiet, contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape which drew on both the [[American West]] and the [[Bible]]. The sparse structure and instrumentation, coupled with lyrics which took the Judeo-Christian tradition seriously, marked a departure not only from Dylan's own work but from the escalating psychedelic fervor of the 1960s musical culture.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 282<U+2013>288</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5<U+2013>9). The song was later recorded by [[Jimi Hendrix]], whose celebrated version Dylan himself acknowledged as definitive in the liner notes to ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''. As proof, since 1974 Dylan and his bands have performed arrangements much closer to Hendrix's than to the ''John Wesley Harding'' version.<ref>[[Biograph (album)]], 1985,  Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].</ref>

[[Woody Guthrie]] died on October 3rd 1967, and Dylan made his first public appearances in eighteen months at a pair of Guthrie memorial concerts the following January.

Dylan's next release, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), was virtually a mainstream country record featuring instrumental backing by [[Nashville]] musicians, a mellow-voiced, contented Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single "[[Lay Lady Lay]]". In 1969 Dylan appeared on the first episode of Cash's new television show and then gave a high-profile performance at the [[Isle of Wight]] rock festival (after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] far closer to his home).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 248<U+2013>253</ref></b>

===1970s===
In the early 1970s critics charged Dylan's output was of varied and unpredictable quality. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine writer and Dylan loyalist [[Greil Marcus]] notoriously asked "What is this shit?" upon first listening to 1970's ''[[Self Portrait]]''. In general, ''Self Portrait'', a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received. Later that year, Dylan released ''[[New Morning]]'', which some considered a return to form. His unannounced appearance at [[George Harrison|George Harrison's]] 1971's ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]]'' was widely praised, but reports of a new album, a television special, and a return to touring came to nothing.

In 1972 Dylan signed onto [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', providing the songs (see [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)]]) and taking a role as "Alias", a minor member of Billy's gang. Despite the film's failure at the box office, the song "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door (song)|Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" has proven its durability, having been covered by over 150 recording artists.<ref>{{cite news

Dylan signed with [[David Geffen]]'s new Asylum label when his contract with [[Columbia Records]] expired in 1973, and he recorded ''[[Planet Waves]]'' with [[The Band]] while rehearsing for a major tour.  The album included two versions of "Forever Young". The phrase may be a reference to [[John Keats]]'s [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]], ("For ever panting, and for ever young") but Dylan turned it into a strangely (for Dylan) sincere and openly heartfelt work (thought to have been inspired by his newfound family life and his children) which has become one of his most popular concert songs.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 273<U+2013>74</ref><ref>{{cite news

A live double album of the tour, ''[[Before the Flood]]'', was released on [[Asylum Records]].

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became publicly estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about his marital problems, and quickly recorded a new album entitled ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'' in September 1974.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 368<U+2013>383</ref> Word of Dylan's efforts soon leaked out, and expectations were high. But Dylan delayed the album's release, and then, by years end he had re-recorded half of the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother [[David Zimmerman (producer)|David Zimmerman]]. 

Released in early 1975, ''Blood on the Tracks'' received mixed reviews. In the ''[[NME]]'', [[Nick Kent]] described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practise takes." In ''Rolling Stone'', reviewer [[Jon Landau]] wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness". However, over the years critics have come to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements, perhaps the only serious rival to his great mid 60s trilogy of albums. In [[Salon.com]], Bill Wyman wrote: "''Blood on the Tracks'' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-'60s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."<ref>{{cite news

That summer Dylan wrote his first successful "protest" song in twelve years, championing the cause of boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]] who he believed had been wrongfully imprisoned for a triple homicide in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]", presenting the case for Carter's innocence.

[[Sam Shepard]] was initially hired as the writer for this film, but ended up accompanying the tour as informal chronicler.<ref>Shepard, ''Rolling Thunder Logbook'', 2<U+2013>49</ref> 

Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album ''[[Desire (album)|Desire]]'' (1976), with many of Dylan's new songs featuring an almost [[travel literature|travelogue]]-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright [[Jacques Levy]].<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 386<U+2013>401</ref><ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 408</ref>  The spring 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, ''Hard Rain'', and the LP ''[[Hard Rain]]''; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002, when ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue|Live 1975]]'' appeared as the fifth volume in Dylan's official ''Bootleg Series''.

The fall 1975 tour with the Revue also provided the backdrop to Dylan's nearly four-hour film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'', a sprawling and improvised narrative mixed with concert footage and reminiscences.

====The "Born Again" Period====
{{further|[[Slow_Train_Coming#Bob_Dylan.27s_conversion_to_Christianity|Slow Train Coming]]}}
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were widely published reports that Dylan had become a [[born again|born-again Christian]].<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 323<U+2013>337, Interview with Assistant Pastor Bill Dwyer, Vineyard Church</ref><ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 490-526, Interview with Pastor Kenn Gulliksen, Vineyard Church</ref><ref>{{cite news

Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: <U+201C>Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob<U+2019>s house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, Yes he did in fact want Christ in His life.

''[[Slow Train Coming]]'' (1979) is generally regarded as the more accomplished of these albums, winning him the [[Grammy Award]] as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "[[Gotta Serve Somebody]]".  The second album, ''[[Saved (album)|Saved]]'' (1980), was not so well-received.  When touring from the fall of 1979 through the spring of 1980, Dylan would not play any of his older, secular works, and delivered what some describe as "sermonettes" on stage, such as: 

{{cquote|Years ago they... said I was a prophet. I used to say, "No I'm not a prophet" they say "Yes you are, you're a prophet." I said, "No it's not me." They used to say "You sure are a prophet."

In 1979, with the release of ''Slow Train Coming'', there was no announcement of his conversion other than what was apparent from his music: {{cquote|Mr. Dylan's record has been preceded by months of rumor as to whether he has or had not converted to fundamentalist Christianity.  The new record may give no guarantees for the future, but it does attest to the fact that, for the moment, Mr. Dylan is very definitely and overtly dealing in just that imagery.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=New York Times| last=Rockwell |first=John |authorlink=John Rockwell|title=Dylan and Morrison in a Religious Vein|date=[[1979-09-02]]|page=d20}}</ref>}} <!--online archive of NY Times starts in 1981 -->

According to him, Dylan was still Dylan, and the same intensity and passion had been present in Dylan's protest songs of the 1960s. Wenner commented:

{{cquote|''Slow Train Coming'' is pure, true Dylan, probably the purest and truest Dylan ever. The religious symbolism is a logical progression of Dylan's Manichaean vision of life and his pain-filled struggle with good and evil... since politics, economics and war have failed to make us feel any better <U+2014> as individuals or as a nation <U+2014> and we look back at long years of disrepair, then maybe the time for religion has come again, and rather too suddenly <U+2014> "like a thief in the night."<ref>{{cite news

Since the early 1980's Dylan's personal religious beliefs have been the subject of much debate among fans and critics. While it is clear that he backed off from the outspoken [[evangelism]] of his Gospel years, it is not clear whether or to what extent his beliefs have changed, as he has typically kept his personal life out of the public eye.  On the level of ''religious practice'' however, he has since supported the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] movement<ref>Fishkoff, '' The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch '', 167</ref> and participated in many Jewish rituals, despite his never having explicitly disavowed any Christian beliefs. In a September 28, 1997, interview appearing in [[The New York Times]], journalist [[Jon Pareles]] reported that "Dylan says he now subscribes to no organized religion."<ref>{{cite news

===Later career===
====1980s====
In the fall of 1980 Dylan briefly resumed touring, restoring several of his most popular 1960s songs to his repertoire, for a series of concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective". ''[[Shot of Love]]'', recorded the next spring, featured Dylan's first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with explicitly Christian songs. The haunting "[[Every Grain of Sand]]" reminded some critics of [[William Blake]]<U+2019>s verses.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 215<U+2013>221</ref>  

In the 1980s the quality of Dylan's recorded work varied, from the well-regarded ''[[Infidels]]'' in 1983 to the panned ''[[Down in the Groove]]'' in 1988.  Critics such as Michael Gray condemned Dylan's 1980s albums both for showing an extraordinary carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray, ''Song & Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan'', 11<U+2013>14</ref>

The ''Infidels'' recording sessions produced several notable outtakes, and many have questioned Dylan's judgment in leaving them off the album. Most well-regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]" (which was both a tribute to the dead blues singer and an extraordinary evocation of African American history reaching back to "the ghosts of slavery ships"<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 56<U+2013>59</ref>), "Foot of Pride" and "Lord Protect My Child";<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 354<U+2013>6</ref> these songs were later released on the boxed set ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991]]''. An earlier version of ''Infidels'', prepared by producer/guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]], contained different arrangements and song selections than what appeared on the final product.

Dylan contributed vocals to [[USA for Africa]]'s [[famine relief]] fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]". On [[13 July]] [[1985]], he appeared at the climax of the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], [[Philadelphia]]. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ron Wood]], Dylan performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to a worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks." His remarks were widely criticised as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organise a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 365<U+2013>7</ref> 

In [[1986 in music|1986]] Dylan made a foray into the world of [[rap music]]. [[Debra Byrd]], a Dylan backup singer who went on to become head vocal coach for [[American Idol]], and industry colleague, Wayne Garfield, (co-writer of Grammy-winning recording, "All For You" by Janet Jackson) arranged<ref>[http://waynegarfield.com/about.htm About Wayne Garfield]</ref> to have Dylan record "Street Rock" as a duet with rap star [[Kurtis Blow]], on the 1986 [[Polygram]] release, ''[[Kingdom Blow]]''.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', p. 63</ref>

In 1987 Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]'s movie ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'', in which he played a washed-up-rock-star-turned-chicken farmer called "Billy Parker", whose teenage lover ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation ([[Rupert Everett]]). The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 599<U+2013>604</ref> 

Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988. Later that spring he took part in the first [[Traveling Wilburys]] album, working with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[George Harrison]] on lighthearted, well-selling fare. Despite Orbison's death, the other four Wilburys issued a sequel in 1990. He also toured with famous rock bands the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers]] in the late 1980s.

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with the [[Daniel Lanois]]-produced ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' (1989).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 387<U+2013>8</ref> Lanois's influence is audible throughout ''Oh Mercy''.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 515</ref><ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 145<U+2013>221</ref> "Ring Them Bells," one of the most celebrated songs on the album, appears to implore Christians to maintain a visible presence in the world ("Ring them bells St. Peter... Ring them bells so the world will know / that God is one").<ref>[http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/ring.html "Lyrics to 'Ring Them Bells' from bobdylan.com"]</ref> The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film ''[[High Fidelity]]'', while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, ''Dylan's Visions of Sin'', 413<U+2013>20</ref> Dylan also made a number of music videos during this period, but only "Political World" found any regular airtime on [[MTV]].

====1990s====
[[Image:B dylan 1996.jpg|thumb|Dylan performs at a 1996 concert in Stockholm.]]
Dylan's 1990s began with ''[[Under the Red Sky]]'' (1990), an about-face from the serious ''Oh Mercy''. The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", and contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The "Gabby Goo Goo" dedication was later explained as a nickname for Dylan's four-year-old daughter.<ref>{{cite news

Despite the stellar line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.  Dylan would not make another studio album of new songs for seven years.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 391</ref>  

In 1991 Bob Dylan was inducted into the [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]] and in 1992 Dylan performed a brief tour with [[Santana (band)|Santana]] [http://www.mnmusichalloffame.org/inductees.html]

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering old folk and blues numbers: ''[[Good as I Been to You]]'' (1992) and ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 423</ref> penned by a 19th century teacher and sung by Dylan with a haunting reverence. An exception to this rootsy mood came in Dylan's 1991 songwriting collaboration with [[Michael Bolton]]; the resulting song "Steel Bars", was released on Bolton's album ''[[Time, Love & Tenderness]]''. In 1995 Dylan recorded a live show for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. He claimed his wish to perform a set of traditional songs for the show was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on a greatest hits package.<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 408<U+2013>9</ref> The album produced from it (see [[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)]]) included "[[John Brown]]", an unreleased 1963 song detailing the ravages of both war and [[jingoism]].

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,<ref>Heylin, ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited'', 693</ref>  Dylan returned to the recording studio with Lanois in January 1997. Late that spring, before the album's release, he was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, [[pericarditis]], brought on by [[histoplasmosis]]. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon."<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 420</ref> He was back on the road by midsummer, and in early fall performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]]. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a sermon based on Dylan's lyric "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]".<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 426</ref>

September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, ''[[Time Out of Mind]]''.  With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan's first collection of original songs in seven years became highly acclaimed.  It also achieved an unforeseen popularity among young listeners, particularly the opening song, "Love Sick".<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 426<U+2013>9</ref>  This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" [[Grammy Award]] (he was one of numerous performers on ''[[Concert for Bangladesh|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', the 1972 winner). The love song "[[Make You Feel My Love]]" was covered by both [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Billy Joel]]. 

In December 1997 [[President Clinton]] presented Dylan with a Kennedy Center Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven't always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He's disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."<ref>{{cite news

During June or July of 1999 Dylan toured with [[Paul Simon]] and they performed a couple of songs together at each show, including [[I Walk the Line]] ([[Johnny Cash]]) and [[Blue Moon Of Kentucky]] ([[Bill Monroe]]).

====2000 and beyond====
In 2000 his song "[[Things Have Changed]]", penned for the film ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]'', won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Song]]. For reasons unannounced, the Oscar (by some reports a facsimile) tours with him, presiding over shows perched atop an amplifier.<ref>{{cite news

In February of 2003, an 8-minute long epic ballad called "Cross The Green Mountain", written and recorded by Dylan, was released as the closing song on the soundtrack to the Civil War movie ''[[Gods and Generals]]'', and later appeared as one of the 42 rare tracks on the iTunes Music Store release of ''Bob Dylan: The Collection''. A music video for the song was also produced in promotion of the motion picture.

2003 also saw the release of the film ''[[Masked & Anonymous]]'', a creative collaboration with television producer [[Larry Charles]], featuring many well-known actors. Dylan and Charles cowrote the film under the pseudonyms Rene Fontaine and Sergei Petrov.<ref>{{cite web

In 2005 preproduction began on a film entitled ''[[I'm Not There|I'm Not There: Suppositions on a Film Concerning Dylan]]''.

Dylan himself returned to the recording studio at some point in 2005, where he recorded "Tell Ol' Bill" for the motion picture ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]''. The song is an original composition, not a cover of the similarly titled traditional folk song. The melody is based on "I Never Loved But One" by the [[Carter Family]].

In February 2006, Dylan recorded tracks for a new album in New York City that resulted in the album ''[[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|Modern Times]]'', released on [[August 29]] [[2006]]. This date also included the [[iTunes Music Store]] release of ''[[Bob Dylan: The Collection]]'', a digital box set containing all of his studio and live albums (773 tracks in total), along with 42 rare & unreleased tracks and a 100 page booklet. To promote the digital box set and the new album (on iTunes), Apple released a 30 second TV spot featuring Dylan, in full country & western regalia, lip-synching to "Someday Baby" against a striking white background.  In a well-publicized interview to promote the album, Dylan criticised the quality of modern sound recordings and claimed that his new songs "probably sounded ten times better in the studio when we recorded 'em".<ref>{{cite news

At 65, Dylan became the oldest living musician to top the [[Billboard]] albums chart. The record also reached number one in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.

Nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]], ''Modern Times'' won for Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album and Bob Dylan also won for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for "Someday Baby."  Modern Times was ranked as the #1 album of 2006 by [[Rolling Stone Magazine]].

In September 2006 Scott Warmuth, an Albuquerque, N.M.-based disc jockey, noted similarities between Dylan's lyrics in the album, ''Modern Times'' and the poetry of [[Henry Timrod]], the 'Poet Laureate of the Confederacy'.

For a two and a half year period, between 2003 and 2006, Dylan ceased playing guitar, and stuck to the keyboard during concerts.  Various rumors circulated as to why Dylan gave up guitar during this period, none very reliable. According to David Gates, a [[Newsweek]] reporter who interviewed Dylan in 2004, "...basically it has to do with his guitar not giving him quite the fullness of sound he was wanting at the bottom. (six strings on a guitar, ten fingers on a piano.) He's thought of hiring a keyboard player so he doesn't have to do it himself, but hasn't been able to figure out who.  Most keyboard players, he says, like to be soloists, and he wants a very basic sound."<ref>{{cite news

Dylan chooses songs from throughout his long career, seldom playing the same set twice.  However most of his tours have some staple songs, in particular his biggest hits including songs such as "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" and "[[All Along the Watchtower]]".

===Family===
Dylan privately married [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]] on [[November 22]], [[1965]]; their first child, Jesse Byron Dylan, was born on [[January 6]] [[1966]].  Dylan and Lownds had four children in total: [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse]], Anna Lea, Samuel Isaac Abraham, and [[Jakob Dylan|Jakob]] (born [[December 9]], [[1969]]). Dylan also adopted Sara Lownds' daughter from a prior marriage,  Maria Lownds, (born [[October 21]] [[1961]] now married to musician [[Peter Himmelman]]). In the 1990s the youngest of his four children with Sara, [[Jakob Dylan]], became well known as the lead singer of the band [[The Wallflowers]]. [[Jesse Dylan]] is a film director and a successful businessman.  Dylan and Lownds were divorced on [[June 29]] [[1977]],<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 198<U+2013>200</ref> though they reportedly remained in regular contact for many years and, by some accounts, even to the present day. 

In June 1986, Dylan secretly married his longtime backup singer [[Carolyn Dennis]] (often professionally known as Carol Dennis).<ref>Sounes, ''Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan'', 372<U+2013>3</ref>  Their daughter, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, was born on [[January 31]], [[1986]].

}}</ref>  Dylan wrote three chapters about the year between his arrival in [[New York City]] in 1961 and recording his first album. Dylan focused on the brief period before he was a household name, while virtually ignoring the mid-1960s when his fame was at its height. Details about his motorcycle accident are limited to a few words in a single sentence. He also devoted chapters to two lesser-known albums, ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970) and ''[[Oh Mercy]]'' (1989), which contained insights into his collaborations with poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] and producer [[Daniel Lanois]]. In the ''[[New Morning]]'' chapter, Dylan expresses distaste for the "spokesman of a generation" label bestowed upon him, and evinces disgust with his more fanatical followers.

Another section features Dylan's account of a guitar-playing style in mathematical detail that he claimed was the key to his renaissance in the 1990s.<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Vol. 1'', 156<U+2013>162</ref> Despite the [[opacity]] of some passages, there is an overall clarity in voice that is generally missing in Dylan's other prose writings,<ref name="Maslin"> </ref> and a noticeable generosity towards friends and lovers of his early years.<ref>{{cite web

In these passages, Dylan suggested the process which ignited his own song writing.

''Chronicles: Volume One'' reached number two on ''[[The New York Times]]''' Hardcover Non-Fiction best seller list in December 2004 and was nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. Simultaneously, [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes & Noble]] reported the book as their number two best-seller among all categories.<ref>Gray, ''The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia'', 136<U+2013>8</ref> ''Chronicles: Volume One'' is the first of three planned volumes.
