The '''Beechcraft Model 34 "Twin-Quad"''' was a prototype [[airliner]] designed and built by [[Beechcraft]] in the period between [[World War II]]  and the [[Korean War]].<ref name="B">Phillips 1992</ref> At this time many aircraft manufacturers in the [[United States]] anticipated a boom in [[civil aviation]] and a large number of designs left the drawing board only to ultimately fail. The Model 34 was one of these failures, partly because of its unusual design, and partly because of the thousands of ex-military transport aircraft that were available at the time for a fraction of the price of a new aircraft.

==Design and development==
The design was a four-engine high-wing [[monoplane]] with [[tricycle undercarriage]], originally designed for 14 (three abreast seating with six additional seats mounted on the side)<ref>Neal 1970, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref> and eventually converted to take 20 passengers.<ref name="B"/> The side "couch seats" were also able to be folded away so that cargo could be carried internally in the cabin. Individual storage space was provided for each passenger seat on the fuselage side above the seat. In order to accommodate a larger cargo load, a cargo hatch was located near the pilot's compartment.<ref name="Neal p. 15">Neal 1970. p. 15.</ref> 

The unusual aspects of the design were the butterfly or V-tail and engine layout that led to its popular nickname, "Twin Quad." The four engines were buried in the wings, with each pair of engines connected to a single propeller via [[clutch]]es and a common [[gear box]].<ref name="B"/> The engines were [[Flat engine|horizontally opposed]] eight-cylinder air-cooled [[Lycoming GSO-580]]s<ref name="B"/> (GSO denoting '''G'''eared '''S'''upercharged and '''O'''pposed, with each engine featuring a built-in reduction gear box in addition to the common propeller gear box). The engines were rated at 400 [[horsepower]] at 3,300 [[rpm]]. The tail was unusual because unlike the vertical and two horizontal surfaces found on most aircraft, the Twin-Quad's was a two-surface V-tail similar to the tail fitted to Beechcraft's other new product at the time, the [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Model 35 Bonanza]].<ref name="B"/> The V-tail configuration was flight-tested on a twin-engine Beech AT-10.<ref name="Neal p. 15"/>

Another, but more conventional, design aspect was that the belly was made strong enough to sustain minimal damage in the event of a "wheels-up" landing, with built-in integral landing keels or "skids."<ref name="Neal p. 16<U+2013>17">Neal 1970, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref> The wing measured {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} from tip to tip and the fuselage was {{convert|53|ft|m|abbr=on}} long.<ref>[http://www.aerofiles.com/_beech.html "List of Beechcraft Models with basic specifications."] ''www.aerofiles.com''. Retrieved: November 9, 2007.</ref>  With the top of the V-tail almost {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ground and a design maximum take off weight (MTOW) of 20,000&nbsp;lbs,<ref name="Neal p. 15"/> the Model 34 is to date the largest and heaviest Beechcraft civil design,<ref>The [[Beechcraft 1900]] has a longer fuselage but shorter wingspan, with a significantly lower MTOW, and the [[Beechcraft Starship]] is smaller in all dimensions and also has a significantly lower MTOW.</ref> with only the smaller [[XA-38 Grizzly]] military aircraft outweighing it.

==Operational history==
The Model 34 took to the air for the first time on October 1, 1947, with Beech Chief Pilot Vern L. Carstens at the controls.<ref>[http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/history/article.asp?id=92#october "Wings Over Kansas List of Aviation Anniversaries."] Retrieved: November 9, 2007.</ref> The first flight was uneventful and the initial report from the test pilot was, "We have another outstanding Beechcraft!"<ref name="Neal p. 15"/>

The prototype Model 34 had accumulated more than 200 hours of test flying when the reinforced belly was validated in a wheels-up landing.<ref>Simpson 1991, p. 42.</ref>  On January 17, 1949, in a severe [[forced landing]] a few miles northwest of the Beech plant shortly after taking off, the sole Beech 34 was damaged beyond repair. An inadvertent cutting off of an emergency master switch when battling an electrical fire had resulted in the shut down of all the powerplants, leading to the crash. The co-pilot was killed and the pilot and two flight observers were injured in the crash.<ref name="Neal p. 17">Neal 1970, p. 17.</ref>

After the accident, Beech re-evaluated plans to go into series production with the Model 34. At the time, two new prototypes were being manufactured, one for static test and the other to continue the flight test program. One of the main considerations was that the U.S. [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Board]] was delaying the licensing of the anticipated "feeder airlines" for which the design was intended.<ref name="Neal p. 64.">Neal 1970, p. 64.</ref> The Beech 34 ultimately could not compete in major and regional airline operations with the thousands of less complex and cheaper war surplus transports, such as the larger [[Douglas DC-3]]/[[C-47 Skytrain]], the similarly sized [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-60 Lodestar]] and Beechcraft's own smaller [[Beechcraft Model 18]].

Despite its promise, since the "Twin Quad" had attracted no orders, Beech terminated the project, closing down the production line in January 1949.<ref name="Neal p. 64."/>
