'''Bert Sutcliffe''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (17 November 1923 in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand]] <U+2013> 20 April 2001 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand) was a [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] [[Test cricket]]er. Sutcliffe was a successful left-hand batsman. His batting achievements on tour in England in 1949, which included four fifties and a century in the Tests, earned him the accolade of being one of [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year]].  He captained New Zealand in four Tests in the early 1950s, losing three of them and drawing the other. None of Sutcliffe's 42 Tests resulted in a New Zealand victory. In 1949 Sutcliffe was named the inaugural [[Halberg awards|New Zealand Sportsman of the Year]], and in 2000 was named as New Zealand champion sportsperson of the decade for the 1940s.<ref>Romanos, p.114</ref>

==Batting highlights==
Sutcliffe established himself when he scored 197 and 128 in the same match against [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at Dunedin in 1946<U+2013>47.  On the 1949 tour of England, he scored 243 and 100 not out in the same match against Essex at Southend, going on to total 2,627 runs on the tour at an average of 59.70.  He made two triple-hundreds in his career with 355 for Otago against Auckland in 1949<U+2013>50 and 385 against Canterbury in 1952<U+2013>53.  Playing for New Zealand against India at New Delhi in 1955<U+2013>56, he scored 230 not out which was then a record for New Zealand.<ref name=B235/>

==New Zealand tour of South Africa: 1953<U+2013>54==
Sutcliffe is especially noted for an innings of 80 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg on [[Boxing Day]] 1953. New Zealand's batsmen were routed by South African fast bowler [[Neil Adcock]] on a green wicket. Sutcliffe was hit in the head by Adcock and, having left the field to receive hospital treatment, returned to the crease swathed in bandages. He took on the bowling, hitting a number of sixes, until the ninth wicket fell. The New Zealand fast bowler [[Bob Blair (cricketer)|Bob Blair]], next man in, was understood to be back at the team hotel distraught as his fiancee had been killed in the [[Tangiwai disaster]] two days earlier. Sutcliffe started to walk off only to see Blair walk out. Despite the presence of 23,000 fans, silence enveloped the ground. 33 runs were added in 10 minutes before Blair was out. New Zealand lost the Test match by a considerable margin. Notwithstanding this, the noted New Zealand cricket writer Dick Brittenden said: "It was a great and glorious victory, a story every New Zealand boy should learn at his mother's knee".{{cn}} 

==Retirement==
After Sutcliffe retired from cricket he became a coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/67774.html|title=Robinson R: Bert Sutcliffe in Ellis Park 1953-4|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> Sutcliffe was recently{{When|date=February 2011}} inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.

==Style and technique==
Sutcliffe is described in ''Barclays World of Cricket'' as one of New Zealand's "most productive and cultured batsmen".<ref name=B235>Barclays, p.235.</ref>
