'''Lewes Free Presbyterian Church''' is one of seven [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] places of worship in England.  It is based in a former [[Calvinism|Calvinistic Independent]] chapel in the Cliffe area of [[Lewes]], the county town of [[East Sussex]] and the main town in the [[Districts of England|local government district]] of [[Lewes (district)|Lewes]].  '''Jireh Chapel''' is more than 200 years old and originally housed an independent [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] congregation.  It has been designated a Grade I [[Listed building]].

==History==
The ancient [[market town]] of Lewes has a well-established history of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Nonconformism]].  Many chapels were established in the 18th and 19th centuries in the town itself and in its suburbs of Southover and Cliffe.<ref name="VCH56910">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56910|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 7.

In or around 1805 a dispute arose between Jenkin Jenkins, the minister at Cliffe's [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]] chapel, and its congregation.  He was dismissed by the Countess's Trustees and arranged for a new chapel to be built for him nearby.<ref name="Stell79">{{Harvnb|Stell|1999|p=79.}}</ref>  (The Countess of Huntingdon chapel, which opened in 1775, survived until the 1880s but has been demolished.)<ref name="PoW38">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=38.}}</ref>  Jireh Chapel was placed in the hands of trustees about 1807.  Prior to that time it had been the personal property of Jenkin Jenkins.  The Trust Deed states that the Chapel is a place of Christian worship to be "frequented and enjoyed by a congregation of Protestant Dissenters of the Calvinistic persuasion professing ..".  A list of certain Articles of Faith, extracted from the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, follows.  The Article on Infant baptism (Article 27) is included in the Trust Deed of the Chapel.<ref name="North">{{Harvnb|North|n.d.}}</ref>

Jenkins enlisted [[William Huntington (preacher)|William Huntington]] to open the church, which was completed in 1805.<ref name="Stell79"/>  Huntington, originally from [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] in Kent, was an orthodox but controversial Calvinist preacher who ministered at Providence Chapel, Grays Inn Lane, London.  Known by various [[pseudonym]]s, he became very popular in southeast England in the early 19th century, and helped to found several Calvinist chapels.<ref name="Stell77<U+2013>78">{{Harvnb|Stell|1999|pp=77<U+2013>78.}}</ref>  An example of his eccentricity was his reference to Jenkins as "W.A."

[[epithet]] featured on a tablet below the chapel's [[gable]]d roof which commemorated its opening.  It reads {{smallcaps|Jireh chapel erected by J.

The chapel proved popular, and was extended in 1826 to give a capacity of about 1,000.<ref name="PoW38"/><ref name="Stell80"/><ref name="IoE293297"/>  The interior was almost entirely wooden, with box-[[pew]]s and galleries.<ref name="PoW38"/>  A [[Sunday school]] was built in the grounds in 1874; it was linked to the chapel's north wall by a columned porch surmounted by a [[pediment]].<ref name="IoE293297"/>  The chapel's use declined in the 20th century,<ref name="Stell80"/> and the Loyal Orange Institution of England, Southdowns Lodge used it for their annual commemorative service on the Sunday prior to November 5.  Many members of the various Bonfire Societies attended this annual "Bonfire" service.

The Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster [[Christian denomination|denomination]] was founded by [[Ian Paisley]] on 17 March 1951 in [[Crossgar]], a village in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="FPCU-List">{{cite web|url=http://www.freepres.org/churchlist.asp?loc=world|title=Church Finder|year=1999|publisher=[[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]]|accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>  It quickly became established across Northern Ireland, where dozens of churches were founded, and some congregations developed in the rest of Great Britain as well.  Scotland and Wales each have several, and as of {{CURRENTYEAR}} there are seven in England.<ref name="FPCU-List"/>  The Lewes congregation established itself in the Jireh chapel, which is therefore now in regular use again. Lewes has a strong history of non-conformism and has one of the few [[Orange Order|Orange lodges]] in the South of England.

==Architecture==
[[File:Tuscan-columned Entrance, Jireh Chapel, Lewes.JPG|thumb|right|The Tuscan-columned porch]]
Although externally clad in red brick and tiles, the chapel is completely [[Timber framing|timber-framed]].<ref name="Stell79"/><ref name="IoE293297"/>  The entrance is at the east end and is framed by a porch with columns of the [[Tuscan order]], described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as "over-broad".<ref name="Pevsner559">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=559.}}</ref>  Above this, three evenly spaced [[sash window]]s, an [[oculus]] and the stone tablet sit below the gable.  A [[chimney breast]] extends up the west wall.  The roof is covered with [[slate]] tiles and has a small boxlike [[Louver|louvred]] projection, topped with a pyramid-style cap, in the middle.  There are four pairs of sash windows in the north and south walls, which are faced with [[mathematical tile]]s and slates respectively.<ref name="IoE293297"/>

Inside, wood predominates: the [[Barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] timber roof is supported on wooden columns attached to the gallery which runs around all four sides of the interior.  The galleries are in turn held up with five timber columns on the north and south sides.<ref name="Stell80"/><ref name="IoE293297"/>  Wooden staircases leading to the galleries are situated in all four corners.  An octagonal [[pulpit]] stands at the west end.<ref name="IoE293297"/>  Original pine box-pews remain in the galleries and the main body of the chapel.<ref name="PoW38"/><ref name="Stell80"/><ref name="IoE293297"/>

==The church today==
Lewes Free Presbyterian Church is one of seven such churches established in England: there are others in [[Bridlington]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Oulton Broad#Oulton Broad village|Oulton Broad]] in [[Suffolk]] and [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] in [[Devon]].<ref name="FPCU-List"/>  Two Sunday services and a Monday meeting take place each week.<ref name="FPCU-Lewes">{{cite web|url=http://www.freepres.org/church.asp?lewes|title=Lewes, England, United Kingdom|year=1999|publisher=[[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]]|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>

The church was designated a Grade I [[Listed building]] on 25 February 1952.<ref name="IoE293297"/>

Under the name Jireh Chapel, the church was licensed for worship in accordance with the [[Places of Worship Registration Act 1855]] with the registration number 15521.<ref name="WR-15521">{{WorshipReg|id=15521|name=Jireh Chapel|address=Malling Street, Cliffe, Lewes|denom=Calvinists|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>
