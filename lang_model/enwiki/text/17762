The '''Oregon Zoo''', formerly the '''Washington Park Zoo''',<ref name="zoohistory"/><ref name=renamed>{{cite news|title = Portland's zoo is now named Oregon Zoo|date=April 25, 1998|publisher=[[The Oregonian]]}}</ref> is a [[zoo]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the largest city in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. Located {{convert|2|mi}} southwest of [[Downtown Portland]], the zoo is inside Portland's [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], and includes a narrow-gauge [[excursion train]] that connects to the [[International Rose Test Garden]] inside the park. Opened in 1887 after a private animal collector donated his animals to the City of Portland, the {{convert|64|acre|m2}} zoo is now owned by the regional  [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] government.

A member of the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]], it has successful breeding programs for [[California Condor]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s.<ref name=roar/> The zoo also boasts an extensive plant collection throughout its animal exhibits and specialized gardens.<ref name=gardens>{{cite web|title=Oregon Zoo Gardens|url=http://www.oregonzoo.org/Exhibits/Gardens/index.htm|publisher=Oregon Zoo

The Oregon Zoo is Oregon's largest paid attraction, with more than 1.6 million visitors in 2008 to 2009.<ref name="zaav">{{cite news|url=http://www.zandavisitor.com/newsarticle-1741-Oregon_Zoo%27s_Baby_Elephant_Helps_Smash_Attendance_Records|title=Oregon Zoo's Baby Elephant Helps Smash Attendance Records|last=LaMarche|first=Bill|date=July 1, 2009|work=Zoo and Aquarium Visitor|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref>

==History==
The Oregon Zoo was founded in 1888, making it the oldest North American zoo west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]<ref name="zoohistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonzoo.org/AboutZoo/justthefacts.htm|title=Oregon Zoo History|work=About|publisher=Oregon Zoo|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>. It all began with two grizzly bears purchased by Richard Knight.

A former seaman turned pharmacist, Knight began collecting animals from his seafaring friends. He kept his collection in the back of his drug store on Third & Morrison streets. When caring for the animals became too large a responsibility he sought to sell them to the city of Portland.

Instead of buying the animals, the city offered to give Knight two circus cages and allowed him to place the caged bears on the grounds of the City Park (now called Washington Park).

Care and feeding of the bears, however, still fell to the Knight family and friends. It wasn't long before Knight addressed the city council again regarding the bears. Just five months later, he offered to donate the young grizzly, along with its cage (it is unclear what happened to the second bear) to the city. Portland City Council accepted his offer on November 7, 1888.

Thus began the Portland Zoo, later to be renamed the Oregon Zoo.

By 1894 there were over 300 animals in the zoo<U+2019>s collection. In 1925, the zoo moved to the site of the present [[Portland Japanese Garden]], and moved again in 1959 to its current site.  The zoo was renamed the '''Portland Zoological Gardens''' in 1959.<ref name="zoohistory"/> At this time, [[Washington Park and Zoo Railway]] was constructed to connect the zoo to its former site, and the other attractions in Washington Park. The zoo became popular locally in 1953, when Rosy the Asian elephant was acquired. The zoo became world-famous in 1962 when the [[Asian elephant]] "Packy" was born.  He was the first [[elephant]] born in the Western Hemisphere in 44 years and is (as of 2010) the tallest Asian elephant in the United States at 10.5&nbsp;ft (3.2 m) tall .A total of 28 more calves have been born at the Oregon Zoo, including seven sired by Packy (two of which still live with him), making it the most successful zoo elephant breeding program in the world.  On August 23, 2008 Rose-Tu, the granddaughter of the zoo's first elephant Rosy, gave birth to a son named Samudra. This makes Samudra the first third generation captive born elephant in North America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free the elephants! Problems plague the Oregon Zoo's pachyderms |url=http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=3107 |publisher=Willamette Week}}</ref>

In 1971, management was given to [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], which continues expansion projects, aided by donors, sponsors and volunteers.<ref name="zoohistory"/> The zoo was renamed in 1976 as the Washington Park Zoo after a naming contest.<ref name="zoohistory"/> The Metro Council changed the zoo's name from the Washington Park Zoo to the Oregon Zoo in April 1998.<ref name="renamed"/>  In September of that year, the zoo became accessible by the region's [[MAX Light Rail|MAX light rail]] system, with the opening of a [[MAX Blue Line|Westside MAX]] line featuring an underground [[Washington Park (MAX station)|Washington Park station]].<ref>"Go west, young MAX" (September 9, 1998). ''The Oregonian'' (special section).</ref> In 2003, the zoo began participation in a [[condor|California condor]] recovery program started by [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]] and [[Los Angeles Zoo]]. The program is designed to breed California condors to be released into the wild and save them from extinction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Condor egg could herald return of giant|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/04/03/condor.egg.ap/index.html |publisher=CNN|date=2007-04-03}}</ref>
