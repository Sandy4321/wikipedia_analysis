'''Aspasia''' (ca. 470 BC<ref name="Nails58-59">D. Nails, ''The People of Plato'', 58<U+2013>59</ref><ref>P.

Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 195</ref> Very little is known about the details of her life. She spent most of her adult life in Athens, and she may have influenced Pericles and Athenian politics. She is mentioned in the writings of [[Plato]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Xenophon]], and other authors of the day. 

Ancient writers also reported that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a [[harlot]], although these accounts are disputed by modern scholars, on the grounds that many of the writers were comic poets concerned with defaming Pericles.<ref name="Wallace">R.W. Wallace, [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1996/96.04.07.html Review of Henry's book]</ref> Some researchers question even the historical tradition that she was a [[hetaera]], or [[courtesan]], and have suggested that she may actually have been married to Pericles.{{Ref_label|A|<U+03B1>|none}} Aspasia had a son by Pericles, [[Pericles the Younger]], who later became a general in the Athenian military and was executed after the [[Battle of Arginusae]]. She is believed to have become the courtesan of [[Lysicles (5th century BC)|Lysicles]], another Athenian statesman and general, following the death of Pericles the Elder.

==Origin and early years==
Aspasia was born in the [[Ionia]]n Greek city of Miletus (in the modern province of [[Ayd<U+0131>n]], [[Turkey]]). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is evident that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a [[Caria]]n prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.{{Ref_label|B|<U+03B2>|none}}<ref name="Lendering">J. Lendering, [http://www.livius.org/as-at/aspasia/aspasia.html Aspasia of Miletus]</ref>

It is not known under what circumstances she first traveled to Athens. The discovery of a 4th-century grave inscription that mentions the names of Axiochus and Aspasius has led historian Peter K. Bicknell to attempt a reconstruction of Aspasia's family background and Athenian connections. His theory connects her to Alcibiades II of Scambonidae (grandfather of the famous [[Alcibiades]]), who was [[ostracism|ostracized]] from Athens in 460 BC and may have spent his exile in Miletus.<ref name="Nails58-59" /> Bicknell conjectures that, following his exile, the elder Alcibiades went to Miletus, where he married the daughter of a certain Axiochus. Alcibiades apparently returned to Athens with his new wife and her younger sister, Aspasia. Bicknell argues that the first child of this marriage was named Axiochus (uncle of the famous Alcibiades) and the second Aspasios. He also maintains that Pericles met Aspasia through his close connections with Alcibiades's household.<ref name="Bicknell">P.J. Bicknell, ''Axiochus Alkibiadou, Aspasia and Aspasios'', 240<U+2013>250</ref>

According to the disputed statements of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a [[hetaera]] and probably ran a [[brothel]].{{Ref_label|A|<U+03B1>|none}}<ref name="Ar523">Aristophanes, ''Acharnians'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240&layout=&loc=523 523-527]</ref><ref name="Just144">R.

Being a foreigner and possibly a hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed to participate in the public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed.{{Ref_label|C|<U+03B3>|none}}<ref name="Ostwald310">M. Ostwald, ''Athens as a Cultural Center'', 310</ref> Their son, [[Pericles the Younger]], must have been born by 440 BC.

Stadter, ''A Commentary on Plutarch's Pericles'', [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=96911382 239]</ref>

In social circles, Aspasia was noted for her ability as a conversationalist and adviser rather than merely an object of physical beauty.<ref name="Just144" /> According to Plutarch, their house became an intellectual centre in Athens, attracting the most prominent writers and thinkers, including the philosopher [[Socrates]]. The biographer writes that, despite her immoral life, Athenian men would bring their wives to hear her converse.{{Ref_label|D|<U+03B4>|none}}<ref name="Pl24" /><ref name="Adams75-76">H.G.

==Personal and judicial attacks==
Pericles, Aspasia and their friends were not immune from attack, as preeminence in [[Athenian democracy|democratic Athens]] was not equivalent to absolute rule.<ref name="For2">Fornara-Samons, ''Athens from Cleisthenes to Pericles'', [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2p30058m&chunk.id=d0e2016&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e2016&brand=eschol/ 31]</ref> Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions.

According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her.<ref name="Pl24" />

Before the eruption of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431 BC&ndash;404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens in order to satisfy Pericles' perversions.{{Ref_label|E|<U+03B5>|none}} According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet [[Hermippus]] as prosecutor.{{Ref_label|F|<U+03C3><U+03C4>|none}}<ref name="Pl32">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0182&layout=&query=chapter%3D%23177&loc=Per.%2031.1 XXXII]</ref> All these accusations were probably nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was bitter for the Athenian leader. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles,{{Ref_label|G|<U+03B6>|none}} his friend, [[Phidias]], died in prison.

Kagan, ''The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 201</ref>

In ''[[The Acharnians]]'', [[Aristophanes]] blames Aspasia for the Peloponnesian War. He claims that the [[Megarian decree]] of Pericles, which excluded [[Megara]] from trade with Athens or its allies, was retaliation for prostitutes being kidnapped from the house of Aspasia by Megarians.<ref name="Ar523" /> Aristophanes' portrayal of Aspasia as responsible, from personal motives, for the outbreak of the war with [[Sparta]] may reflect memory of the earlier episode involving Miletus and Samos.<ref name="Powel261">A.

==Later years and death==
[[Image:Pericles bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pericles, [[Altes Museum]] (Old Museum), [[Berlin]].]]
 
In 429 BC during the [[Plague of Athens]], Pericles witnessed the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons, [[Xanthippus]] and his beloved [[Paralus]], from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir,<ref name="Pl37">Plutarch, ''Pericles'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0182;query=chapter%3D%23182;layout=;loc=Per.%2036.1/ XXXVII]</ref> a decision all the more hypocritical in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.<ref name="Smith">W. Smith, ''A History of Greece'', 271</ref> Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.

Plutarch cites [[Aeschines Socraticus]], who wrote a [[dialog]]ue on Aspasia (now lost), to the effect that after Pericles's death Aspasia lived with Lysicles, an Athenian general and democratic leader, with whom she had another son; and that she made him the first man at Athens.{{Ref_label|B|<U+03B2>|none}}<ref name="Pl24" /> Lysicles was killed in action in 428 BC.<ref name="Th3.19">Thucydides, III, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&layout=&loc=3.19.1 19]</ref><ref>For year of death, see ''OCD'' "Aspasia"</ref> With Lysicles' death the contemporaneous record ends.<ref name="Adams75-76" /> It is unknown, for example, if she was alive when her son, Pericles, was elected general or when he was executed after the [[Battle of Arginusae]]. The time of her death that most historians give (c. 401 BC-400 BC) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a chronology which is implied in the structure of Aeschines' ''Aspasia''.<ref name="Nails58-59" /><ref name="Taylor41" />

==References in philosophical works==
===Ancient philosophical works===
Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of Plato, [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]].

Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a [[Socratic dialogue]] after Aspasia (though neither survives except in fragments). Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus' ''Aspasia'' are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and [[Cicero]]. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions. When Callias recoils at the notion of a female teacher, Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and, after his death, Lysicles. In a section of the dialogue, preserved in [[Latin]] by Cicero, Aspasia figures as a "female Socrates", counseling first Xenophon's wife and then Xenophon himself (the Xenophon in question is not the famous historian) about acquiring virtue through self-knowledge.<ref name="Kahn26" /><ref name="Cic51-53">Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I, 51<U+2013>53</ref> Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira.<ref name="Vander96-98">C.H.

===Modern literature===
[[Image:Aspasia painting.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait [[Marie Bouliard]], as Aspasia, 1794.]]

Aspasia appears in several significant works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired some of the most famous [[novel]]ists and [[poetry|poets]] of the last centuries. In particular the [[romanticism|romanticists]] of the 19th century and the [[historical novel]]ists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In 1835 [[Lydia Maria Child]], an American [[abolitionism|abolitionist]], novelist, and journalist, published ''Philothea'', a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.<ref name="EA198">E.A. Duyckinc-G.L. Duyckinck, ''Cyclopedia of American Literature'', 198</ref>

In 1836, [[Walter Savage Landor]], an English writer and poet, published ''Pericles and Aspasia'', one of his most famous books. ''Pericles and Aspasia'' is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the [[Age of Pericles]].<ref name="Mac195">R. MacDonald Alden, ''Readings in English Prose'', 195</ref> [[Robert Hamerling]] is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia's personality. In 1876 he published his novel ''Aspasia'', a book about the manners and morals of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. [[Giacomo Leopardi]], an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the ''circle of Aspasia''. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi called this person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.<ref name="Brose271">M. Brose, ''A Companion to European Romanticism'', 271</ref>

In 1918, novelist and [[playwright]] George Cram Cook produced his first full-length [[Play (theatre)|play]], ''The Athenian Women'', which portrays Aspasia leading a strike for peace.<ref name="Greasley120">D.D. Anderson, ''The Literature of the Midwest'', 120</ref> Cook combined an anti-war theme with a Greek setting.<ref>M Noe, [http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Bai/noe.htm Analysis of the Midwestern Character]</ref> American writer [[Gertrude Atherton]] in ''The Immortal Marriage'' (1927) treats the story of Pericles and Aspasia and illustrates the period of the Samian War, the Peloponnesian War and the Plague of Athens. [[Taylor Caldwell]]'s ''Glory and the Lightning'' (1974) is another novel that portrays the historical relationship of Aspasia and Pericles.<ref>L.A. Tritle, The Peloponnesian War, 199</ref>

==Fame and assessments==
Aspasia's name is closely connected with Pericles' glory and fame.<ref>K. Paparrigopoulos, Ab, 220</ref> Plutarch accepts her as a significant figure both politically and intellectually and expresses his admiration for a woman who "managed as she pleased the foremost men of the state, and afforded the philosophers occasion to discuss her in exalted terms and at great length".<ref name="Pl24" /> The biographer says that Aspasia became so renowned that even [[Cyrus the Younger]], who went to war with the King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]], gave her name to one of his concubines, who before was called Milto. After Cyrus had fallen in battle, this woman was carried captive to the King and acquired a great influence with him.<ref name="Pl24" /> [[Lucian]] calls Aspasia a "model of wisdom", "the admired of the admirable Olympian" and lauds "her political knowledge and insight, her shrewdness and penetration".<ref name="Lucian">Lucian, ''A Portrait Study'', XVII</ref> A [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text, according to which Aspasia composed a speech and instructed a man to read it for her in the courts, confirms Aspasia's rhetorical fame.<ref name="McClure20">L. McClure, ''Spoken like a Woman'', 20</ref> Aspasia is said by the ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] encyclopedia, to have been "clever with regards to words," a [[sophism|sophist]], and to have taught rhetoric.<ref name="Suda">Suda, article [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&enlogin=guest&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=alpha,4202 Aspasia]</ref>

The artists shall be Aeschines and Socrates his master, most realistic of painters, for their heart was in their work. We could choose no better model of wisdom than Milesian Aspasia, the admired of the admirable 'Olympian'; her political knowledge and insight, her shrewdness and penetration, shall all be transferred to our canvas in their perfect measure. Aspasia, however, is only preserved to us in miniature: our proportions must be those of a colossus."

On the basis of such assessments, researchers such as Cheryl Glenn, Professor at the [[Pennsylvania State University]], argue that Aspasia seems to have been the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches.<ref name="Glenn">C. Glenn, ''Remapping Rhetorical Territory '', 180<U+2013>199</ref> Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the [[Socratic method]].<ref name="Glenn">C. Glenn, ''Locating Aspasia on the Rhetorical Map'', 23</ref><ref name="Jarratt">Jarratt-Onq, ''Aspasia: Rhetoric, Gender, and Colonial Ideology'', 9<U+2013>24</ref> However, Robert W. Wallace, Professor of classics at [[Northwestern University]], underscores that "we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher". According to Wallace, the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].<ref name="Wallace" /> Kagan describes Aspasia as "a beautiful, independent, brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband".<ref name="Kagan182">D.Kagan, ''Pericles of Athens and the Birth of Democracy'', 182</ref> Roger Just, a [[Classics|classicist]] and Professor of [[social anthropology]] at the [[University of Kent]], believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure, but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man would have to be a hetaera.<ref name="Just144" /> According to Sr. Prudence Allen, a philosopher and seminary professor, Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of [[Sappho]].<ref name="Allen29-30" />

==Historicity of her life==
The main problem remains, as [[Jona Lendering]] points out,<ref>[http://www.livius.org/as-at/aspasia/aspasia.html Aspasia of Miletus] at livius.org</ref> that most of the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. [[Thucydides]] does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy representations and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character.<ref name="Wallace" /><ref name="Rothwell22" /> Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like [[Theano]] or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like [[Thargelia (person)|Thargelia]].<ref name="Taylor187">J.E. Taylor, ''Jewish Women Philosophers of First-Century Alexandria'', 187</ref> This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.<ref name="Wallace" />

According to Wallace, "for us Aspasia herself possesses and can possess almost no historical reality".<ref name="Wallace" /> Hence, Madeleine M. Henry, Professor of Classics at [[Iowa State University]], maintains that "biographical anecdotes that arose in antiquity about Aspasia are wildly colorful, almost completely unverifiable, and still alive and well in the twentieth century". She finally concludes that "it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [Aspasia's] life".<ref name="Henry3">M. Henry, ''Prisoner of History'', 3, 10, 127<U+2013>128</ref> According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J. Samons II, Professors of Classics and history, "it may well be, for all we know, that the real Aspasia was more than a match for her fictional counterpart".<ref name="Fornara" />

<div class="references-small">
'''<U+03B1>.''' {{Note_label|A|<U+03B1>|none}} Henry regards as a slander the reports of ancient writers and comic poets that Aspasia was a brothel keeper and a harlot. Henry believes that these comic sallies were to ridicule Athens' leadership and were based on the fact that, by his own citizenship law, Pericles was prevented from marrying Aspasia and so had to live with her in an unmarried state.<ref name="H138-139">M. Henry, ''Prisoner of History'', 138<U+2013>139</ref> For these reasons historian Nicole Loraux questions even the testimony of ancient writers that Aspasia was a hetaera or a courtesan.<ref name="Loraux">N. Loraux, ''Aspasie, l'<U+00E9>trang<U+00E8>re, l'intellectuelle'', 133<U+2013>164</ref> Fornara and Samons also d<U+03B9>smiss the 5th-century tradition that Aspasia was a harlot and managed houses of ill-repute.<ref name="Fornara" />

'''<U+03B2>.''' {{Note_label|B|<U+03B2>|none}} According to Debra Nails, Professor of philosophy at [[Michigan State University]], if Aspasia was not a free woman, the decree to legitimize her son with Pericles and the later marriage to Lysicles (Nails assumes that Aspasia and Lysicles were married) would almost certainly have been impossible.<ref name="Nails58-59" />

'''<U+03B3>.''' {{Note_label|C|<U+03B3>|none}} Fornara and Samons take the position that Pericles married Aspasia, but his citizenship law declared her to be an invalid mate.<ref name="Fornara" /> Wallace argues that, in marrying Aspasia, if he married her, Pericles was continuing a distinguished Athenian aristocratic tradition of marrying well-connected foreigners.<ref name="Wallace" /> Henry believes that Pericles was prevented by his own citizenship law from marrying Aspasia and so had to live with her in an unmarried state.<ref name="H138-139" /> On the basis of a comic passage Henry maintains that Aspasia was probably a ''pallake'', namely a [[concubine]].<ref name="H21">M. Henry, ''Prisoner of History'', 21</ref> According to historian William Smith, Aspasia's relation with Pericles was "analogous to the left-handed marriages of modern princes".<ref>W. Smith, ''A History of Greece'', 261</ref> Historian [[Arnold W. Gomme]] underscores that "his contemporaries spoke of Pericles as married to Aspasia".<ref name="Gomme">[[A. W. Gomme]], ''Essays in Greek History & Literature'', 104</ref>

'''<U+03B4>.''' {{Note_label|D|<U+03B4>|none}} According to Kahn, stories such as Socrates' visits to Aspasia, along with his friends' wives and Lysicles' connection with Aspasia, are not likely to be historical. He believes that Aeschines was indifferent to the historicity of his Athenian stories and that these stories must have been invented at a time when the date of Lysicles' death had been forgotten, but his occupation still remembered.<ref name="Vander96-98" />

'''<U+03B5>.''' {{Note_label|E|<U+03B5>|none}} Kagan estimates that, if the trial of Aspasia happened, "we have better reason to believe that it happened in 438 than at any other time".<ref name="Kagan197" />

'''<U+03C3><U+03C4>.''' {{Note_label|F|<U+03C3><U+03C4>|none}} According to James F. McGlew, Professor at Iowa State University, it is not very likely that the charge against Aspasia was made by Hermippus. He believes that "Plutarch or his sources have confused the law courts and theater".<ref name="Glew53">J.F. McGlew, ''Citizens on Stage'', 53</ref>

'''<U+03B6>.''' {{Note_label|G|<U+03B6>|none}} Athenaeus quotes Antisthenes saying that Pericles pleaded for her against charges of impiety, weeping "more tears than when his life and property were endangered".<ref name="Ath589">Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'', XIII, 589</ref>

'''<U+03B7>.''' {{Note_label|H|<U+03B7>|none}} Omphale and Deianira were respectively the [[Lydia]]n queen who owned [[Heracles]] as a slave for a year and his long-suffering wife. [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Athenian dramatists]] took an interest in Omphale from the middle of the 5th century. The comedians parodied Pericles for resembling a Heracles under the control of an Omphale-like Aspasia.<ref name="Stadter240">P.A. Stadter, '' A Commentary on Plutarch's Pericles'', [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=96911382 240]</ref> Aspasia was called "Omphale" in the ''Kheirones'' of Cratinus or the ''Philoi'' of Eupolis.<ref name="Powel261" />

'''<U+03B8>.''' {{Note_label|I|<U+03B8>|none}} <U+0391>s wife of the "Olympian" Pericles.<ref name="Stadter240" /> Ancient Greek writers call Pericles "Olympian", because he was "thundering and lightening and exciting Greece" and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating.<ref name="ArDi">Aristophanes, ''Acharnians'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240;query=card%3D%2326;layout=;loc=541/ 528<U+2013>531] and Diodorus, XII, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0083;query=chapter%3D%23208;layout=;loc=12.41.1/ 40]</ref>

'''<U+03B9>.''' {{Note_label|K|<U+03B9>|none}} Cratinus (in ''Dionysalexandros'') assimilates Pericles and Aspasia to the "outlaw" figures of Paris and Helen; just as Paris caused a war with Spartan [[Menelaus]] over his desire for Helen, so Pericles, influenced by the foreign Aspasia, involved Athens in a war with Sparta.<ref name="Padilla">M. Padilla, [http://facstaff.unca.edu/drohner/awomlinks/artherktrach1.htm#_ednref17 Labor's Love Lost: Ponos and Eros in the Trachiniae]</ref> Eupolis also called Aspasia Helen in the ''Prospaltoi''.<ref name="Stadter240" />
