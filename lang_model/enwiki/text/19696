A group of close-by (200-500 pc) isolated young cooling [[neutron stars]] (see a review in Kaplan (2008)<ref>Kaplan 2008</ref>).

The first sources of this type - RX J1856.5-3754 - was discovered by Walter et al.<ref>Walter et al. 1996</ref>.

The term  - ''The Magnificent Seven'' - was initially proposed in  for the following sources: RX J185635-3754, RBS1556, RBS1223, RX J0806.4-4132, RX J0720.4-3125, RX J0420.0-5022 and MS 0317.7-6647.<ref>Treves et al. 2001</ref> However, soon it was shown that MS 0317.7-6647 is not a [[neutron star]]. Then in 2001 a new object of this type was discovered: 1RXS J214303.7+065419/RBS 1774<ref>Zampieri et al. 2001</ref>. Since 2001 no new good candidates appeared.

All seven sources were discovered by the [[ROSAT]] satellite.

All seven are recognized
to be relatively close-by (less than a few hundred
pc), middle-age (about several hundred thousands
years) isolated neutron stars emitting soft x-rays due to cooling.
The latter is confirmed by the blackbody shapes of their
spectra. Typical temperatures are about 50<U+2013>100 eV. At
least six out of the seven show spin periods in the range
~3<U+2013>12 s.

The lightcurve shapes are quasisinusoidal
and single-peaked. However, RX J1308.6+2127 displays a doublepeaked
lightcurve, and in RX J0420.0-5022 there is some evidence
for a skewness in the pulse profile, with a slower rise and faster decline. Rather counter-intuitively, the spectrum of both RX
J0720.4-3125 and RX J1308.6+2127 becomes harder at pulse minimum.

A
coherent timing solution has been recently obtained for RX J0720.4-3125 and
RX J1308.6+2127. The period derivatives are 7 10<sup><U+2212>14</sup> s/s and 10<sup><U+2212>13</sup>
s/s, respectively <ref>Kaplan, van Kerkwijk 2005</ref>. The derived dipolar field is 2<U+2013>3  10<sup>13</sup> G and the spin-down
ages are 2 and 1.5 Myr.

For a long time the Seven were considered to be steady sources, to the
point that RX J0720.4-3125 was included among the calibration sources for
the EPIC and RGS instruments on board XMM-Newton. The continuous
monitoring revealed however that the source underwent conspicuous changes
in the period 2001-2003. In particular, while the total flux stayed
more or less constant, the blackbody temperature steadily increased, going
from <U+223C> 86 to over 90 eV. This was accompanied by a change of the pulse
profile, with an increase of the pulsed fraction. More recently this trend seems to have reversed. Starting from 2004, the temperature decreased and there
are hints that the overall evolution may be cyclic, with a period of ~10 yr<ref>Hohle et al. 2008</ref>.

The Magnificent seven represent a large class of young neutron stars with many properties different from normal [[radio pulsars]].
Also there are other types of young isolated neutrons stars like [[soft gamma repeaters]], [[anomalous X-ray pulsars]], [[rotating radio transients]], [[central compact objects in supernova remnants]] which are different from standard [[radio pulsars]]. Some of them can be related to the Magnificent seven.<ref>Popov 2008</ref>.

Some of the
seven have very weak optical counterparts. For the
brightest one (RX J1856-3754), the [[trigonometric parallax]]
and [[proper motion]] are known <ref>Kaplan et al. 2002</ref>. The distance to the sources is ~161 pc.
Similar data is obtained for the second brightest object RX J0720.4-3125. The distance is ~330 pc. Projected velocities are ~280&nbsp;km/s and ~115&nbsp;km/s, correspondently<ref>Kaplan 2008</ref>.
These data
provide the possibility to reconstruct the 3D trajectory,
and so identify the birth site of the NS. Distance estimates to other sources can be found in Posselt et al. (2007)<ref>Posselt et al. 2007</ref>.

Population synthesis studies <ref>Popov et al. 2003</ref> show that the Magnificent seven
are related to the [[Gould Belt]] <U+2014>a local structure with an
age of ~30<U+2013>50 Myrs formed by massive stars. Reconstruction
of trajectories of ]]neutron stars]] confirmed this conclusion.
In the solar vicinity, these [[neutron stars]] outnumber radio
pulsars of the same age. This means that the Magnificent seven-like
objects can be one of the most typical young [[neutron stars]] with
a galactic birth rate larger than that of normal [[radio pulsars]].

[[XMM-Newton]] observations made it possible to
detect wide absorption features in spectra of several
among the Magnificent seven. 
Although their origin is not clear yet (see Haber (2006)<ref>Haberl 2006</ref> for references and more detailed
description of the results),
it is almost certain that the star strong magnetic field plays a fundamental
role in their formation. Absorption features may then provide a powerful
diagnostics for the strength of the surface field. 
At present, two
main explanations for their origin have been suggested: either proton cyclotron resonances or atomic transitions in light elements. Interestingly, for the two sources in which a spin-down
measure is available, the values of B obtained from spin-down assuming magnetodipolar
braking are in reasonable agreement with those inferred from the line
energy.
Once the nature of the lines
has been settled and if an independent measurement of the magnetic field
is available (e.g. through spin-down), a measure of the gravitational redshift
will be possible, paving the way to the simultaneous determination
of both the star mass and radius.

The seven objects seem to be the best laboratory
to study neutron star atmospheres and, probably, internal
structure.
The holy grail of neutron star astrophysics is the
determination of the equation of state (EOS) of matter at supra-nuclear
densities. The most direct way of constraining the EOS is to measure simultaneously
the neutron star mass and radius. If a neutron
star emits blackbody radiation from its surface of radius R at homogeneous
temperature T , the received flux at distance D is just F = <U+03C3>T<sup>4</sup>(R/D)<sup>2</sup>.
So, if distance is known and T could be determined by spectral analysis,
the previous relation immediately yields the star radius. Not surprisingly
reality is a trifle more complicated, as it is discussed in more detail in the
next sections. Still, this oversimplified analysis catches the essence of what
is needed in order to measure the neutron star radius: distance, flux and
surface temperature. Observing the star thermal emission is therefore crucial.
Among all thermally emitting neutrons stars the Magnificent Seven
are the only ones with a purely blackbody spectrum. Their clean thermal
emission, unmarred by contaminations from magnetospheric activity,
a surrounding nebula or supernova remnant, makes these sources ideal
targets for such a study: the Magnificent Seven are the perfect neutron
stars!

Despite many attempts no radio emission is detected from these sources.
The preliminary results from latest deep search with the GBT telescope are presented by Kondratiev et al.<ref>Kondratiev et al. 2008</ref>. The are claims that some signal was detected at very low frequencies <ref>Malofeev et al. 2007</ref>, but these results are not very certain and requere confirmation.

These objects are also known under the name XDINS - X-ray Dim Isolated [[Neutron Stars]]. 
Or XTINS - X-ray Thermal [[Neutron Stars]].

Data for the table were partly taken from Kaplan (2008)<ref>Kaplan 2008</ref>, partly from a yet unpublished review by R. Turolla <ref>Turolla 2008</ref>, partly from other sources.
Note, that temperature estimates can slightly vary in different publications.
The source RX J0720.4-3125 is variable in temperature and pulsed fraction.<ref>Hohle et al. 2008</ref>
