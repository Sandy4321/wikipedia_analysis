==History==

===Name===
The acronym [[ARM architecture|ARM]], first used in 1983, originally stood for "Acorn RISC Machine", the processor from [[Acorn Computers]], its first [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processor used in the original [[Acorn Archimedes]] and one of the first RISC processors. However, when the company was incorporated in 1990, the acronym was changed to stand for "Advanced RISC Machines" in the company name "Advanced RISC Machines Ltd." Then, at the time of the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] in 1998, the company name was changed to "ARM Holdings",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=ARMH&selected=ARMH |title=ARM Holdings, plc, Company Description <U+2013> NASDAQ.com |publisher=Quotes.nasdaq.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> often just called ARM just as the processors.

===Founding===
The company was founded in November 1990 as '''Advanced RISC Machines Ltd''' and structured as a [[joint venture]] between [[Acorn Computers]], Apple Computer (now [[Apple Inc.]]) and [[VLSI Technology]].<ref>[http://www.arm.com/aboutarm/milestones.html ARM milestones], ARM company website.

==Operations==

===Business model===
Unlike most traditional microprocessor suppliers, such as [[Intel]], [[Freescale]] (the former semiconductor division of [[Motorola]]) and [[Renesas]] (a former joint venture between [[Hitachi]] and [[Mitsubishi Electric]]),<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/licensing/licencees.html Processor Licensees], ARM company website. Retrieved 5 February 2008</ref> ARM only creates and licenses its technology as [[Semiconductor intellectual property|intellectual property]] (IP), rather than manufacturing and selling its own physical [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, GPUs, SoCs or microcontrollers. This model is similar to fellow British design houses: [[Synopsys#ARC International|ARC International]], and [[Imagination Technologies]] who have similarly been designing and licensing GPUs, CPUs, and SoCs, along with supplying tooling and various design and support services to their licensees.

===Facilities===
The company has offices and design centres <!--not centres please as this is a British English article--> across the world, including [[San Jose, California]], [[Austin, Texas]], and  [[Olympia, Washington]] in the United States; [[Bangalore]] in India; [[Trondheim]] in Norway; [[Lund]] in Sweden; [[Sophia Antipolis]] in France; [[Munich]] in Germany; [[Yokohama]] in  Japan;  China, Taiwan, Slovenia and Hungary.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/careers/life-at-arm/locations-around-the-world.php ARM offices], ARM company website. Retrieved 12 March 2014</ref>

==Technology==
A characteristic feature of ARM processors is their low [[electric power]] consumption, which makes them particularly suitable for use in portable devices.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/ ARM Processor Overview], ARM company website. Retrieved 5 February 2008</ref> In fact, almost all modern mobile phones and [[personal digital assistant]]s contain ARM CPUs, making them the most widely used [[32-bit]] microprocessor family in the world.

==Licensees==
ARM offers several microprocessor core designs that have been "publicly licensed" 830 times including 117 times for their newer "application processors" (non-microcontroller) used in such applications as smartphones and tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.com/products/processors/licensees.php|title=Processor Licensees|work=arm.com|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> Six of those companies<!--Calxeda is missing even if they are listed below with ARM press release--> have a licence for the their most powerful processor core, the [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[ARM Cortex-A57|Cortex-A57]] (some including ARM's other 64-bit core the [[ARM Cortex-A53|Cortex-A53]]) and four have a licence to their most powerful 32-bit core, the [[ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore|Cortex-A15]].

Cores for 32-bit architectures include Cortex-A15, [[ARM Cortex-A12|Cortex-A12]], [[ARM Cortex-A17|Cortex-A17]], [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore|Cortex-A9]], [[ARM Cortex-A8|Cortex-A8]], [[ARM Cortex-A7|Cortex-A7]] and [[ARM Cortex-A5|Cortex-A5]], and older "Classic ARM Processors", as well as variant architectures for microcontrollers that include these cores: [[ARM Cortex-R7]], [[ARM Cortex-R5]], [[ARM Cortex-R4]], [[ARM Cortex-M4]], [[ARM Cortex-M3]], [[ARM Cortex-M1]], [[ARM Cortex-M0+]], and [[ARM Cortex-M0]] for licencing; the three most popular licensing models are the "Perpetual (Implementation) License", "Term License" and "Per Use License".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.com/products/buying-guide/licensing/index.php|title=Licensing ARM IP|publisher=ARM Holdings|accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref>

Companies often license these designs from ARM to manufacture and integrate into their own [[System on a chip|''System on chip'']] (SoC) with other components such as [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s (sometimes ARM's Mali) or [[Baseband processor|radio basebands]] (for mobile phones).

In addition to licenses for their core designs, ARM offers an "architectural licence" for their instruction sets, allowing the licensees to design their own cores that implement one of those instruction sets. An ARM architectural licence is more costly than a regular ARM core licence,<ref name="anand7112-arch-lic3">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7112/the-arm-diaries-part-1-how-arms-business-model-works/3|title=The ARM Diaries, Part 1: How ARM<U+2019>s Business Model Works|first=Anand Lal|last=Shimpi|publisher=[[Anandtech]]|page=3|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> and also requires the necessary engineering power to design a CPU based on the instruction set.
