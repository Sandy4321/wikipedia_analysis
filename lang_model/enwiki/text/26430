She is the founder and executive director of the [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]], [[California]]-based [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]] (SPARC),<ref>http://www.sparcmurals.org/sparcone/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=50</ref> a [[community art]]s center, and is best known as the director of the [[mural]] project that created one of the largest murals in the world, the ''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]''.<ref>http://blogs.uscannenberg.org/sharis_delgadillo/2009/11/las-muralist-legend-judy-baca.html</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Baca was born in [[East Los Angeles, California]] on September 20, 1946 to [[Mexican American]] parents, her father Valentino Marcel, a musician, whom she never met, and her mother Ortencia, who worked at a tire factory.<ref name="Biography Today">{{cite book |last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2009|page=21|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7808-1052-5}}</ref> She was raised in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], [[Los Angeles]] (a predominately Mexican-American neighborhood), in an all-female home, with her mother, aunts Rita and Delia, and her grandmother Francisca.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.22">"Biography Today", pp.22</ref> Her grandmother was a herbal healer and practiced [[Curandero|curanderismo]]<ref name="Biography Today, pp.22"/>, which profoundly influenced her sense of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Chicano]] culture. 

In 1952, her mother married Clarence Ferrari. After, the three of them moved to [[Pacoima, Los Angeles]]. This neighborhood was drastically different then Watts, as the Mexican-Americans were minorities and Ferrari, of Italian descent, did not want Spanish to be spoken in the house.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.22"/>

===Education===
As well as at home, she was not allowed to speak Spanish in school, and she did not know English very well. It did take some time, and she started to become better in classes once she was able to understand the textbooks. With the encouragement of her art teacher, she began drawing and painting. She would graduate from [[Bishop Alemany High School]] in 1964.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.22"/>  

She then attended [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN) and earned her Bachelor's degree in 1969 and Master's degree in art in 1979. While there, she learned and studied [[Abstract art|modern abstract art]]. She wanted to make art for her family and the people in Watts, but she knew they didn't go to galleries. "I thought to myself, if I get my work into galleries, who will go there? People in my family hadn ever been in a gallery in their entire lives. My neighbors never went to galleries...And it didn't make sense to me at the time to put art behind some guarded wall."<ref>"Biography Today", pp.23</ref>  

===Teacher and other jobs===
When she graduated from CSUN, she got a job teaching at her former high school. Her students were not very friendly with each other, and she thought she had an idea as to teach them how to cooperate with each other. She had a group of her students make a mural on one side of the school's wall. Everybody wanted to work on it, and it forced them to work things out without fighting. Baca was present at the 1970 [[Chicano Moratorium]], an [[anti-war]] action of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The principal of the school believed teachers should not take part in the protest marches, and she was fired with several other teachers.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.25</ref>  

After being fired, she thought she could never get another job because of her involvement in the protests. She would find her next job at the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. Her new job consisted of her teaching art for a summer program in the city's public park. In [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles]], at this time, had the most Mexican-Americans and had the highest number of gangs in the country. Members of different gangs loitered in the parks she worked at, and she noticed the graffiti and she knew it was territorial markings. "You could read a wall and learn everything you needed to know about that community." One of her favorites was, "I'd rather spend one day as a lion than a hundred as a lamb."<ref>"Biography Today", pp.25-26</ref>  

===''Las Vistas Nuevas''===
In the summer of 1970, Baca wanted to find a way to have art bridge the neighborhood. She decided to create a mural in Boyle Heights as a way for people to positively feel the neighborhood was theirs. In the first team, she had twenty members from four different gangs, and the group decided on the name ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' ("New Views"). The mural they would create would show images that would be familiar to the Mexican-Americans who were living in the neighborhood. "I want to use public space to create a public voice for, and a public consciousness about people who are, in fact, the majority of the population but who are not represented in any visual way.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.26</ref>

====''Mi Abuelita''====
Their first project was on three walls of an outdoor stage in [[Hollenbeck Park]]. ''Mi Abuelita'' ("My Grandmother"), the mural depicted a Mexican-American grandmother with her arms outstretched  as if to give a hug. "This work recognized the primary position of the matriarch in Mexican families. It also marked the first step in the development of a unique collective process that employs art to mediate between rival gang members competing forp ublic space and public identity." <ref name="Biography Today, pp.26-27">"Biography Today", pp.26-27</ref>

This project was difficult because she had to get the different members to cooperate with each other. Every day, problems arose with gang members who were not on the mural team and they didn't like what Baca was doing. They would attempt to interfere with the project, by threatening team members and vandalizing the work site. Local police did not like the idea of rival gang members together, fearing it would spark gang violence. She also began to work on the mural without permission from the city or the manager of Hollenbeck Park, which arouse questions from her supervisor and other city officials.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.27</ref>

Despite all of the trouble, Baca wanted to finish the project. She had lookouts who would signal the mural team if rival gang members were headed toward the work site or if the police were coming. One day, a city official came to the park because he had been getting complaints about the project. After seeing the progress being done and the team members working so well with each other, he gave Baca permission from the city to complete the mural. "The city was amazed at the work I was doing, making murals with kids who scared directors out of neighborhood centers."<ref name="Biography Today, pp.28">"Biography Today", pp.28</ref>

After it's completion, the community loved it. Baca said, "Everybody related to it. People brought candles to that site. For 12 years people put flowers at the base of the grandmother image." ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' would complete a total of three murals that summer.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.28"/>

After the murals, she was offered a job in 1970 as the director of a new citywide mural program. She was in charge of creating the program from ground up, including choosing where murals go, designing the murals, and supervising the mural painting teams. They would consist of teenagers who were in trouble with the police. Members of the original ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' were hired to help run the multi-site program. This group would go on to paint more than 500 murals.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.28"/>

With this new job, she encountered her first problems with [[censorship]]. People in the neighborhoods of the murals wanted to show all parts of life of the neighborhood, the good and bad. The city, however, did not want any controversy shown on the murals. One example was when the city objected to a mural that showed people struggling with police, and they threatened to stop funding the program if Baca did not remove it. Baca said, "I really liked the idea that the work could not be owned by anyone. So, therefore it wasn't going to be interesting to the rich or to the wealthy, and it didn't have to meet the caveats of art that museums would be interested in. Rather than give in , she formed the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]] (SPARC) in 1976 to continue funding the creation of murals in public.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.28-29</ref>

==SPARC==
===''Great Wall of Los Angeles''===
Their first project was the ''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]''. She was hired by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to help improve the area around a [[San Fernando Valley]] flood control channel called the [[Tujunga Wash]]. It's essentially a ditch that contained a large concrete retaining wall. Her idea for a mural was to paint a history of the city of [[Los Angeles]], but not the version found in history books. The events that were overlooked were the ones that interested her. "It was an excellent place to bring youth of varied ethnic backgrounds from all over the city to work on an alternate view of the history of the U.S. which included people of color who had been left out of American history books." Baca also said the defining metaphor of the mural would be "It is a tattoo on the scar where the river once ran."<ref>"Biography Today", pp.29-30</ref>

Baca was inspired by ''Los tres Grandes'' ("The Three Greats"), an novel about the three of the most influential Mexican muralists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Jos<U+00E9> Clemente Orozco]]. In 1977, she attended a workshop at the Taller Siqueiros in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], to learn muralism techniques and see their murals in person. Even though all three were deceased at the time, she was able to work with some of Siqueiros former students. She also interviewed people about their lives, family histories, ancestry, and stories they remember hearing from their older relatives, as well as consulting history experts. From this, she was able to create the design for the mural. Some of the things portrayed in the mural was the first time they were blazoned in public, including but not limited to the [[Dust Bowl]] Journey, [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]], [[Zoot Suit Riots]], and the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Bus Rides]].<ref>"Biography Today", pp.30-31</ref>

Baca wanted the project to be done by people as diverse as the ones that were to be painted. She had people from all different ages and backgrounds participate. Some were scholars and artists, but the majority were just community members. "Making a mural is like a big movie production, it can involve 20 sets of scaffolding, four trucks, and food for 50 people." 400 people came out and help paint the mural, which took seven summers to complete, and was finished in 1984.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.31">"Biography Today", pp.31</ref>

==Teaching career==
Baca began a professorship at [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980, and left in 1994.<ref>http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3622/Judy-Baca.html</ref> The next year, she implemented the Muralist Training Workshop to teach people the techniques she had picked up.<ref name="Biography Today, pp.31"/> She also was a professor at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] from 1994 to 1996, where she co-founded the Visual & Public Arts Institute Department. 

In 1996, she moved to [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) and took on multiple roles. In 1993, she co-founded UCLA's [[Cesar E. Chavez|Cesar Chavez]] Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, an institution for which she serves as vice chair. 

In 1998, she served as a master artist in residence with the Role of the Arts in Civic Dialogue at [[Harvard University]] <ref name="aztlanjournal.metapress.com">http://aztlanjournal.metapress.com/media/49te8dtumq0yywh4uc5v/contributions/5/4/3/1/5431776771586217.pdf</ref>

===''The World Wall'' and other projects===
In 1987, she began painting ''The World Wall: A Vision of the Future Without Fear'', a painting that showed the world with no-violence. She believed the first step to world peace was imagining it, and she wanted artist from all over the world to help her paint it. She wanted it to be painted in panels so it could moved around to different places. After years of planning and contributions from artists from other countries, it had its debut in [[Finland]] in 1990. The idea was when the panels traveled the world, the host country would add their own panel to the collection. Some of the countries include [[Russia]], [[Israel]]/[[Palestine]], [[Mexico]], and [[Canada]].<ref>"Biography Today", pp.31-32</ref>

In 1988, [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] [[Tom Bradley (politician)|Tom Bradley]] commissioned her to create the Neighborhood Pride Program, a citywide project to paint murals. The project employed over 1,800 at-risk youth and is responsible for over 105 murals throughout the city. 

In 1996, she created ''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra'' ("Our Land Has Memory") for the [[Denver International Airport]]. This one was personal for Baca, as her grandparents fled Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and came to [[La Junta, Colorado]], [[Colorado]].<ref name="aztlanjournal.metapress.com"/> The mural "not only to tell the forgotten stories of people who, like birds or water, traveled back and forth across the land freely, before there was a line that distinguished which side you were from, but to speak to our shared human condition as temporary residents of the earth...The making of this work was an excavation of a remembering of their histories." It was completed in 2000.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.34</ref>

She conducted research by interviewing residents and lead a workshop with [[Colorado State University<U+2013>Pueblo|University of Southern Colorado]] students. She found a picture in a garage in [[Pueblo]] by Juan Espinosa, photographer and founder El Diario de la Gente, Boulder, Colorado, of an important meeting between [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Corky Gonzales]] of the Colorado Crusade for Justice and [[Cesar Chavez]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], and their agreement to bring the [[Delano grape strike]] to Colorado.<ref name="aztlanjournal.metapress.com"/>

In June 2008, Judy spoke at the "Against the Wall: The ruin and renewal of LA's murals" panel held at Morono Kiang Gallery across the street from the famous "Pope of Broadway" mural. In that same year, she made the ''Cesar Chavez Monument Arch of Dignity, Equality, and Justice''. It is located at [[San Jose State University]]. It has a portrait of [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Mahatma Ghandi]], and [[Dolores Huerta]].<ref>"Biography Today", pp.35</ref>
