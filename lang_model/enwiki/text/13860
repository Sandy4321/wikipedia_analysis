Buford was the son of John and Nancy Hickman Buford. He was born in [[Woodford County, Kentucky]] on his family's [[plantation]], "Rose Hill." At the time of his birth his namesake, the Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] of France, was at the height of his power. Buford graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1827 and served for eight years in the artillery and in 1835 resigned from the service to become an [[engineer]].  He thereafter engaged in iron manufacturing and [[bank]]ing at [[Rock Island, Illinois]], [[Illinois|Ill.]], and became president of the [[Rock Island and Peoria Railroad]], which went bankrupt when major Southern bonds were defaulted with the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

==Civil War service==
In the Civil War, he first served as colonel of the 27th Illinois Infantry, fighting at the [[Battle of Belmont]].  He then commanded the so-called "Flotilla Brigade" of the [[Army of the Mississippi]] during the [[Battle of Island Number Ten]].  This was a brigade of infantry which served on board the gunboats of the [[Western Flotilla]].

On April 16, 1862 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed Buford [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] of U.S. Volunteers, to rank from April 15, 1862.<ref name="Eicher719">Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]], ''Civil War High Commands'', Stanford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8047-3641-3 p. 719</ref> Buford commanded the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of the Mississippi during the [[Siege of Corinth|siege]] and [[Second Battle of Corinth|Battle of Corinth]].  In the final days of 1862, he served on the [[Court-martial of Fitz John Porter|court-martial that convicted]] Major General [[Fitz John Porter]] of cowardice and disobedience.  On November 29, 1862 he was appointed [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] of U.S. Volunteers but this appointment expired on March 4, 1863 and he reverted to brigadier general on that date.<ref name="Eicher719"/>  For the rest of the war Buford served as commander of the District of East Arkansas. Buford was mustered out of the army on August 24, 1865.<ref name="Eicher719"/> On July 5, 1867, President [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Buford for appointment to the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] grade of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 19, 1867.<ref>Eicher, 2001, p. 711</ref>

His younger half brother, [[John Buford]], was also a West Point graduate (Class of 1848) and a general in the Union Army during the Civil War, commanding the 1st Division, Cavalry Corps, [[Army of the Potomac]]. A cousin, [[Abraham Buford II|Abraham Buford]], was a general in the [[Confederate States Army]].
