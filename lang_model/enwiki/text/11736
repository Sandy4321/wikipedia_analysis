The '''15th World Scout Jamboree''' was held in [[1983]] and was hosted by [[Canada]] at [[Kananaskis, Alberta|Kananaskis]], [[Alberta]], an area of Provincial Park 4,000 feet in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, 80 miles west of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. ''The Spirit Lives On'' was the theme of the World Jamboree, with a total attendance of over 15,000 Scouts from nearly 100 countries.  

The wild feel of the camp was enhanced by regular visits from bears and moose, which would wander in and out of the area.
