There's this whole other layer, but Sonya's feelings for Toadie are genuine."<ref name="SonyaSecret"/> When ''[[TV Week]]'' asked how it is possible that Callum would not remember his mother, Morey explained "We did have to look at that, but he's never known much about his mother. His great-grandmother raised him and never gave him much information since she was so disappointed in Sonya, who had Callum at 16. I also think Callum's blocked out any image he had of her, who he hasn't seen for many years."<ref name="SonyaSecret"/> Morey added that Sonya does not feel like she deserves to be Callum's mother because she hates the person she used to be. She thinks that it is better if Callum knows her like she is now.<ref name="SonyaSecret"/>
