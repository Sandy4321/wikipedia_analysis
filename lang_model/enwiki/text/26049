'''Troll Satellite Station''' ({{lang-no|Troll satelittstasjon}}), commonly abbreviated '''TrollSat''', is a [[satellite ground station]] located at [[Troll (research station)|Troll]] in [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Antarctica]]. The earth station is owned by [[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] (KSAT), a joint venture between the [[Kongsberg Group]] and the [[Norwegian Space Center]]. The [[radome]]s are located on top of [[Jutulsessen]], a [[nunatak]] area next to the research station at Troll. The research station is operated by the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]], which also maintains the earth station. TrollSat started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened on 20 January 2008.

The earth station serves [[low Earth orbit]] satellites and consists of a {{convert|7.3|m|sp=us|adj=on}} antenna capable of [[S band]] and [[X band]] reception. Information is relayed using a {{convert|4.8|m|sp=us|adj=on}} and a {{convert|7.6|m|sp=us|adj=on}} [[C band]] uplink. Operations control is carried out by KSAT in [[Troms<U+00F8>]], [[Norway]]. Satellites using TrollSat include [[Radarsat]], [[GeoEye]], [[WorldView]] and [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]]. The system is coordinated with [[Svalbard Satellite Station]] (SvalSat) in [[Longyearbyen]], Norway, which combined offer downloading twice per orbit.

==History==
Troll was established as a research station by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1990.<ref name=k153>Kyvik (2008): 153</ref> The station took its name from the surrounding jagged mountains, which resemble [[troll]]s of [[Norse mythology]].<ref>Rubin (2008): 305</ref> Already at this time there were proposals by the Norwegian Space Centre to establish an earth station at Troll, but the lack of all-year activity stranded the plans.<ref>Wormdal (2011): 109</ref> Instead, SvalSat was established to serve as an earth station for NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS).<ref>Wormdal (2011): 38</ref> Longyearbyen was selected because of its high [[latitude]], which allows all satellites with an orbit above {{convert|500|km|sp=us|-2}} to use only a single ground station<U+2014>yet download from every orbit.<ref>Wormdal (2011): 40</ref> The Svalbard facility opened on 15 April 1999<ref>Wormdal (2011): 41</ref> and was originally owned by the Norwegian Space Centre. Kongsberg Satellite Services was established in 2002 to jointly operate SvalSat and [[Troms<U+00F8> Satellite Station]] (TSS).<ref name=delplan>{{cite web |url=http://www.lokalstyre.no/getfile.aspx/document/epcx_id/597/epdd_id/731 |title=Delplan for Svalbard Satellittstasjon (SvalSat), Plat<U+00E5>berget |publisher=[[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] |date=12 October 2005 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 April 2012 |archivedate=12 April 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66rpxoyE1 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In 2003, Norwegian authorities decided to extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a [[territorial claims of Antarctica|territorial claim to Antarctica]] to not have an all-year research station on the continent.<ref name=k153 /> Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005.<ref name=k154>Kyvik (2008): 154</ref> To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent [[Troll Airfield]] was opened on 11 February 2005.<ref name=k153 />

The basis for TrollSat was an agreement signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station for their own transmission needs. The commercial activities would be carried out by Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the [[Antarctic Treaty]], but the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] negated.<ref>Wormdal (2011): 110</ref> The station started operations on 1 March 2007<ref name=sciencepoles>{{cite web |title=Trollsat to Serve Antarctica |url=http://www.sciencepoles.org/news/news_detail/trollsat_to_serve_antarctica/ |date=20 April 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B2Munvah |archivedate=29 September 2012  |deadurl=no}}</ref> and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, [[Jens Stoltenberg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stoltenberg bor i telt i Antarktis |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.4569897 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |last=Molde |first=Eivind |last2=Aune |first2=Oddvin |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B2OXzFzp |archivedate=29 September 2012  |deadurl=no}}</ref>

SvalSat is owned and operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), which is again equally owned by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre, the latter which is again owned by the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Norway)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]].<ref name=aboutksat>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksat.no/node/16 |title=About Us |publisher=[[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archivedate=11 April 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66qfTMATb |deadurl=no}}</ref> KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than thirty minutes after downloading.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/miljo/2011/02/22/nye-data-hvert-30.-minutt-br-overvaker-miljoet-med-satelitter |title=Nye data hvert 30. minutt: Overv<U+00E5>ker milj<U+00F8>et med satelitter |last=Tonstad |first=Per Lars |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=22 February 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 April 2012 |archivedate=12 April 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66rj6bL3U |deadurl=no}}</ref>

KSAT operates two polar ground stations optimized for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being SvalSat at [[Longyearbyen]] in Svalbard, Norway.<ref name=aboutksat /> These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2006/desember/1165799815.02 |title=<U+00D8>yet i himmelen laster ned p<U+00E5> Svalbard |work=[[Forskning.no]] |date=13 December 2006 |last=Gr<U+00F8>nli |first=Kristin Straumsheim |language=Norwegian |accessdate=14 March 2012 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66AN6p7CP |deadurl=no}}</ref> By using both stations, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay.<ref name=about>{{cite web |title=Troll Satellite Station (TrollSat) <U+2013> Antarctica |url=http://www.ksat.no/node/79 |publisher=[[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] |accessdate=4 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tEHjLSg0 |archivedate=4 October 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The ground station is connected to KSAT's Troms<U+00F8> Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and SvalSat. This allows for [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] as also TSS and TrollSat can be used to communicate with the satellites. The operation center is responsible for [[backup]], [[schedule (resource)|scheduling]] and conflict resolution. The facility uses [[interoperability]] and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.<ref name=sk>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org/Spaceops2004Archive/downloads/papers/SPACE2004sp-template00188F.pdf |title=Interoperability reduces cost and risk at Svalbard Satellite Station |last=Skatteboe |first=R. |last2=Kjeldsen |first=A.
