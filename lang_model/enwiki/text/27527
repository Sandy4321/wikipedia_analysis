<!-- This section is a summary. Please make additions to the full History of... article.Thank you. -->
{{Main|History of Detroit}}
The city name comes from the [[Detroit River]] ({{lang-fr|le d<U+00E9>troit du Lac <U+00C9>ri<U+00E9>}}), meaning ''the strait of Lake Erie,'' linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]; in the historical context, the strait included [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] and the [[St. Clair River]].<ref name=Rivi<U+00E8>reduD<U+00E9>troit>{{cite web

There, in 1701, the French officer [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac]], along with fifty-one additional [[French-Canadians]], founded a settlement called [[Fort Detroit|Fort Ponchartrain du ''D<U+00E9>troit'']], naming it after the [[comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV]]. France offered free land to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765, the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.<ref>[http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm French Ontario in the 17th and 18th Centuries - Detroit].

The present church was completed in 1887.<ref name=Woodford/>]]
Fran<U+00E7>ois Marie Picot<U+00E9>, sieur de Belestre ([[Montreal]] 1719<U+2013>1793) was the last French military commander at Fort Detroit (1758<U+2013>1760), surrendering the fort on November 29, 1760 to the British. The region's fur trade was an important economic activity. Detroit's city flag reflects this French heritage. (See [[Flag of Detroit, Michigan]]).<ref name=Woodford/>

During the French and Indian War (1760), [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops gained control and shortened the name to ''Detroit''. Several tribes led by [[Chief Pontiac]], an [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] leader, launched [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763), including a [[siege of Fort Detroit]]. Partially in response to this, the British [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] included restrictions on white settlement in unceded Indian territories. Detroit passed to the United States under the [[Jay Treaty]] (1796). In 1805, fire destroyed most of the settlement. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.<ref>[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html Ste. Anne of Detroit] ''St. Anne Church''. Retrieved on April 29, 2006.</ref>

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan. As the city expanded, the street layout plan developed by [[Augustus B. Woodward]], Chief Justice of the [[Michigan Territory]] was followed. Detroit fell to British troops during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]], was recaptured by the United States in 1813 and incorporated as a city in 1815.<ref name=Woodford/>

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canadian border made it a key stop along the [[underground railroad]].<ref>Blockson, Charles and Chase, Henry (April 2005). [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n2_v10/ai_16883766 Detroit - Follow the North Star, The Guiding Light of the Underground Railroad]. "American Visions."</ref>
Then a Lieutenant, the future president [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was stationed in the city. His dwelling is still at the [[Michigan State Fairgrounds]]. Because of this local sentiment, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War, including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary [[Iron Brigade]]) which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at Gettysburg in 1863. Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying ''Thank God for Michigan!'' Following the death of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Armstrong Custer]] delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near [[Campus Martius Park]]. Custer led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the American Civil War and called them the ''Wolverines''.<ref>Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). "Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg." ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.</ref>

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of the city's [[Gilded Age]] mansions and buildings arose. Detroit was referred to as the ''Paris of the West'' for its architecture, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=Woodford>Woodford, Arthur M. (2001). ''This is Detroit: 1701<U+2013>2001''. Wayne State University Press</ref> Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a transportation hub. The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first [[automobile]] in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue.

[[File:Fordpiquetteplant.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Piquette Plant|Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] (1904), a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan|National Historic Landmark]].]]
In 1903 Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing<U+2014>and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge]] brothers, [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]<U+2014>reinforced Detroit's status as the world's automotive capital; it also served to encourage [[truck]] manufacturers such as Rapid and [[GMC (automobile)|Grabowsky]].<ref name=Woodford/>

With the introduction of [[Prohibition]], smugglers used the river as a major conduit for Canadian [[alcohol|spirits]], organized in large part by the notorious [[The Purple Gang|Purple Gang]].<ref>Nolan, Jenny (June 15, 1999).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 How Prohibition made Detroit a bootlegger's dream town].

[[File:For Those Who Gave All....jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]] of the Civil War in [[Campus Martius Park]].]]
Labor strife climaxed in the 1930s when the [[United Auto Workers]] became involved in bitter disputes with Detroit's auto manufacturers. The labor activism of those years brought notoriety to union leaders such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and [[Walter Reuther]]. The 1940s saw the construction of the world's first urban depressed freeway, [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|the Davison]]<ref>[http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html#M-008 Michigan Highways]. ''michiganhighways.org'' Retrieved on April 30, 2006.</ref> and the industrial growth during [[World War II]] that led to Detroit's nickname as the ''[[Arsenal of Democracy]]''.<ref name=Willowrun>Nolan, Jenny (January 28, 1997).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=73&category=locations Willow Run and the Arsenal of Democracy]. Michigan History, ''The Detroit News''. Retrieved on November 23, 2007.</ref>

Industry spurred growth during the first half of the twentieth century as the city drew tens of thousands of new residents, particularly workers from the [[Southern United States]], to become the USA's fourth largest. At the same time, tens of thousands of European immigrants poured into the city. Social tensions rose with the rapid pace of growth. The ''color blind'' promotion policies of the auto plants resulted in racial tension that erupted into [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|a full-scale riot in 1943]].<ref>Baulch, Vivian M. and Patricia Zacharias (February 11, 1999). [http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=185 1943 Detroit race riots]. Michigan History, ''The Detroit News'' Retrieved on November 23, 2007.</ref>

Consolidation during the 1950s, especially in the [[automobile]] sector, increased competition for jobs. An extensive freeway system constructed in the 1950s and 1960s had facilitated [[commuting]]. The [[12th Street Riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in 1967, as well as [[Desegregation busing|court-ordered busing]] accelerated [[white flight]] from the city. Commensurate with the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs, the city's tax base eroded. In the years following, Detroit's population fell from a peak of roughly 1.8 million in 1950 to about half that number today.<ref name=Woodford/>
[[File:Urban prairie Detroit 1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Urban prairie]] in Detroit]]
The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] impacted the U.S. auto industry as small cars from foreign makers made inroads. [[Heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]] use afflicted the city with the influence of [[Young Boys Inc.|Butch Jones]], Maserati Rick, and the [[Chambers Brothers (gang)|Chambers Brothers]]. ''Renaissance'' has been a perennial buzzword among city leaders, reinforced by the construction of the [[Renaissance Center]] in the late 1970s. This complex of skyscrapers, designed as a ''city within a city,'' slowed but was unable to reverse the trend of businesses leaving [[Downtown Detroit]] until the 1990s.<ref name=Woodford/>
[[File:RenCen.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Renaissance Center]] along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]].]]
In 1980, Detroit hosted the [[Republican National Convention]] which nominated [[Ronald Reagan]] to a successful bid for [[President of the United States]]. By then, nearly three decades of crime, drug addiction, and inadequate policies had caused areas like the Elmhurst block to decay.<ref>[http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/elmhurst/wedlead2/wedlead2.htm Government stuggles with vacant buildings]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}.''Detroit News'', June 20, 2001.</ref> During the 1980s, vacant structures were demolished to reduce havens for [[drug dealer]]s with sizable tracts of land reverted to a form of [[urban prairie]].<ref>Byles, Jeff. "[http://www.lostmag.com/issue2/detroit.php Disappeared Detroit]." ''Lostmag.com''. January 2006. No. 2. Retrieved on April 11, 2009.</ref> 

In the 1990s, the city began to receive a revival with much of it centered in the [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]], [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], and [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] areas. [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) arose on the city skyline. In the ensuing years, three casinos opened in Detroit: [[MGM Grand Detroit]], [[MotorCity Casino]], and [[Greektown Casino]] which debuted as resorts in 2007<U+2013>08. New downtown stadiums were constructed for the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] in 2000 and 2002, respectively; this put the Lions' home stadium in the city proper for the first time since 1974. The city also saw the historic [[Book Cadillac Hotel]] and the [[Fort Shelby Hotel]] reopen for the first time in over 20 years.<ref name=partnership/> The city hosted the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]], 2006 [[Super Bowl XL]], [[2006 World Series]], [[WrestleMania 23]] in 2007 and the [[NCAA]] Final Four in April 2009 all of which prompted many improvements to the downtown area.

The city's riverfront is the focus of much development following the example of [[Windsor, Ontario]] which began its waterfront parkland conversion in the 1990s; in 2007, the first portions of the [[Detroit River Walk]] were laid, including miles of parks and fountains. This new [[urban development in Detroit]] is a mainstay in the city's plan to enhance its economy through tourism.<ref>Bailey, Ruby L.(August 22, 2007). The D is a draw: Most suburbanites are repeat visitors.''Detroit Free Press''. New Detroit Free Press-Local 4 poll conducted by Selzer and Co., finds, "nearly two-thirds of residents of suburban Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties say they at least occasionally dine, attend cultural events or take in professional games in Detroit."</ref> Along the river, developers are constructing upscale condominiums such as [[Watermark Detroit]]. Some city limit signs, particularly on the Dearborn border say "Welcome to Detroit, The Renaissance City Founded 1701."<ref name=Almanac2/><ref name=partnership/>

=== Topography ===
[[File:Large Detroit Landsat.jpg|thumb|200px|A simulated-color satellite image of the Detroit metro area, including Windsor across the river, taken on [[NASA]]'s [[Landsat 7]] satellite.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|143.0|mi2|km2|abbr=off}}; of this, {{convert|138.8|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} is land and {{convert|4.2|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} is water. Detroit is the principal city of the [[Metro Detroit]] and [[Southeast Michigan]] regions.

The highest elevation in the city is in the University District neighborhood in northwestern Detroit, west of Palmer Park, sitting at a height of {{convert|670|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Detroit's lowest elevation is along its riverfront, sitting at a height of {{convert|579|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Detroit completely encircles the cities of [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] and [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]]. On its northeast border are the communities of [[Grosse Pointe]].
[[File:James Scott Fountain - Detroit skyline.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A view of the city from [[Belle Isle Park]].]]
The [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]] is the only international [[wildlife preserve]] in North America, uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} of the [[Detroit River]] and [[Western Lake Erie]] shoreline.

Three road systems cross the city: the original French template, radial avenues from a [[Washington, D.C.]]-inspired system, and true [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|north<U+2013>south roads]] from the [[Northwest Ordinance]] township system. The city is north of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Detroit is the only major city along the U.S.<U+2013>Canadian border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada.

Detroit has four border crossings: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit<U+2013>Windsor Tunnel]] provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the [[Detroit<U+2013>Windsor Truck Ferry]], located near the Windsor Salt Mine and [[Zug Island]]. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city sits atop a {{convert|1500|acre|ha|sing=on}} salt mine that is {{convert|1100|ft|m|-1}} below the surface. The Detroit Salt Company mine has over {{convert|100|mi|km|}} of roads within.<ref>Zacharias, Patricia (January 23, 2000).

[[File:JMRDetroit1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Wayne County Building]] (1897) [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] by John and Arthur Scott.]]
Seen in [[panorama]], Detroit's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles. The [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] neogothic [[spire]]s of the [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) were designed to blend with the city<U+2019>s [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers. Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], they form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the [[Art Deco]] style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are USA's largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].<ref name=AIADetroit>{{Cite book | author=Hill, Eric J. and John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher= Wayne State University Press | id=}}</ref><ref name=DetArch>{{Cite book | author= [[Robert Sharoff|Sharoff, Robert]] | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6}}</ref>

While the [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, residential high-rises are found in neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]] and the [[Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District|Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward.  The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit is near the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] and [[Marygrove College]] which anchors historic neighborhoods including [[Palmer Woods Historic District|Palmer Woods]], [[Sherwood Forest Historic District|Sherwood Forest]], and the [[University District, Detroit|University District]]. 

The [[List of Registered Historic Places in Detroit, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]] lists several area neighborhoods and districts.  Neighborhoods constructed prior to [[World War II]] feature the architecture of the times with wood frame and brick houses in the working class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in middle class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in neighborhoods 
such as [[Brush Park Historic District|Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge Historic District|Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Indian Village]], [[Palmer Woods Historic District|Palmer Woods]], [[Boston-Edison Historic District|Boston-Edison]], and others.

The oldest neighborhoods are along the Woodward and [[East Jefferson Avenue Residential TR|East Jefferson]] corridors, while neighborhoods built in the 1950s are found in the far west and closer to 8 Mile Road. Some of the oldest extant neighborhoods include [[Corktown Historic District|Corktown]], a working class, formerly Irish neighborhood, and Brush Park. Both are now seeing multi-million dollar restorations and construction of new homes and condominiums.<ref name=partnership>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080613121052/http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html The world is coming, see the change].

The [[Detroit International Riverfront]] includes a partially completed three and one-half mile riverfront promenade with a combination of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas from [[Hart Plaza]] to the MacArthur Bridge accessing [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] (the largest island park in a U.S. city). The riverfront includes [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is a two mile (3&nbsp;km) extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of five miles (8&nbsp;km) of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners envision that the riverfront properties condemned under [[eminent domain]], with their pedestrian parks, will spur more residential development. Other major parks include Palmer (north of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]]), River Rouge (in the southwest side), and [[Chene Park]] (on the east river downtown).<ref>Detroit News Editorial (December 13, 2002).

Other, prominent Motor City R&B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s was [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Mayer]] - who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label was a family-operated label located on Third Avenue in Detroit, and was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.<ref name=Carson>{{Cite book

[[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] founded [[Motown Records]] which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Smokey Robinson & The Miracles]], [[Diana Ross & The Supremes]], the [[The Jackson 5|Jackson 5]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]. The Motown Sound played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]], another Detroit R&B star, carried the Motown Sound; however, she did not record with Berry's Motown Label.<ref name=Almanac2/>

Detroit is one of 13 American metropolitan areas that are home to professional teams representing the four major sports in North America. All these teams but one play within the city of Detroit itself (the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Detroit Pistons]] play in suburban [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]]). There are three active major sports venues within the city: [[Comerica Park]] (home of the [[Major League Baseball]] team [[Detroit Tigers]]), [[Ford Field]] (home of the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Detroit Lions]]), and [[Joe Louis Arena]] (home of the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] [[Detroit Red Wings]]). A 1996 marketing campaign promoted the nickname "[[Hockeytown]]".<ref name=Almanac2/>

In college sports, Detroit's central location within the Mid-American Conference has made it a frequent site for the league's championship events. While the MAC Basketball Tournament moved permanently to [[Cleveland]] starting in 2000, the MAC Football Championship Game has been played at Ford Field in Detroit since 2004, and annually attracts 25,000 to 30,000 fans. The [[University of Detroit Mercy]] has a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] program, and [[Wayne State University]] has both NCAA Division I and [[Division II (NCAA)|II]] programs. The NCAA football [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl]] is held at Ford Field each December.

[[Sailboat]] racing is a major sport in the Detroit area. Lake Saint Clair is home to many yacht clubs which host regattas. [[Bayview Yacht Club]], the [[Detroit Yacht Club]], [[Crescent Sail Yacht Club]], [[Grosse Pointe Yacht Club]], The Windsor Yacht Club, and the Edison Boat Club each participate in and are governed by the Detroit Regional Yacht-Racing Association or [[DRYA]]. Detroit is home to many One-Design fleets including, but not limited to, North American 40s, Cal 25s, Cuthbertson and Cassian 35s, Crescent Sailboats, [[Express 27]]s, J 120s, J 105, Flying Scots, and many more.

The [[Crescent Sailboat]], NA-40, and the [[L boat]] were designed and built exclusively in Detroit. Detroit also has a very active and competitive junior sailing program.

The city government is run by a mayor and nine-member city council and clerk elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot. Since voters approved the city's charter in 1974, Detroit has had a "[[Mayor-council government|strong mayoral]]" system, with the mayor approving departmental appointments. The council approves budgets but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking. City ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council. The city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance of municipal records. Municipal [[election]]s for mayor, city council and city clerk are held at four-year intervals, in the year after presidential elections (so that there are Detroit elections scheduled in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, etc.).<ref>Ward, George E.

=== Transportation ===
{{Main|Transportation in metropolitan Detroit}}
With its proximity to Canada and its facilities, [[port]]s, major highways, rail connections and international [[airport]]s, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The city has three international border crossings, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]] and [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]], linking Detroit to [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.<ref>[http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/ambass_brdg/ambass_brdge_ovrvw.htm Ambassador Bridge Crossing Summary (May 11, 2005)].

==== Air ====
[[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] (DTW), the area's principal airport, is located in nearby [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]] and is a primary hub for [[Delta Air Lines]] and a secondary hub for [[Spirit Airlines]]. [[Bishop International Airport]] (FNT) in [[Flint, Michigan]] is the second busiest commercial airport in the region. [[Coleman A. Young International Airport]] (DET), previously called Detroit City Airport, is on Detroit's northeast side. Although [[Southwest Airlines]] once flew from the airport, the airport now maintains only charter service and [[general aviation]].<ref>Sapte, Benjamin (2003).

==== Freeways ====
{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit}}

Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free expressway system administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]]. Four major [[Interstate Highway]]s surround the city. Detroit is connected via [[Interstate 75]] and [[Interstate 96]] to [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. I-75 (The Chrysler and Fisher Freeways) is the region's main north-south route, serving [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit-Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.

I-94 (The Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east-west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to [[Chicago]]) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the current I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. [[Henry Ford]] built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. I-96 runs northwest-southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne Counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.

I-275 runs north-south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. I-375 (The Chrysler Spur) is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (The Reuther Freeway) runs east-west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan State highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.
