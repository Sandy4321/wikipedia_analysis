'''Shawnee on Delaware''' is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] on the [[Delaware River]], part of [[Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Smithfield Township]] in [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania]]. It is situated just south of the foothills of the [[Pocono Mountains]], {{convert|2.6|mi}} southwest of the [[Shawnee Mountain Ski Area]] and about {{convert|75|mi}} west of [[New York City]]. According to the 2000 census it has a population of 176 people.{{sfn|Shawnee On Delaware: USA.Com}}

The first white settler, Nicholas Depuy, arrived from New Amsterdam, New York in 1727.  His home was used as a fort during the  [[French and Indian War]] (1754<U+2013>1763). In 1904, [[Worthington Hall]], later known as the Shawnee Playhouse, was built in the village. Shawnee is also the home of the [[Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort]], originally built as the [[Buckwood Inn]] with a course designed by [[A. W. Tillinghast]] in the early 20th century. The largest [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] tree in the state is situated at Shawnee Presbyterian Church Cemetery, standing {{convert|36|ft}} high and {{convert|67|in|m}} around the trunk.

==History==
[[Shawnee]] tribe refugees from Ohio settled in the area in 1692.{{Sfn|Grumet|1995|p=26}} The first white settler was Nicholas Depuy, from New Amsterdam, New York, who arrived in 1727 and bought {{convert|3000|acre}} of land from the local Minsi tribe of [[Lenape]] Indians. During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754<U+2013>1763) his home was used as a fort, and became known as Fort Depuy. The village was given its name by a surveyor sent by [[William Penn]], who mistakenly thought the local Indians were [[Shawnee]].{{sfn|About Shawnee: Shawnee Inn}}

In 1736, a ferry began to operate, traveling from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River to New Jersey. By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store, and in 1753 he built a stone and log church used by ministers of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. The cornerstone of this church remains, now part of the Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The farming community grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church.{{sfn|About Shawnee: Shawnee Inn}} Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original sounding board.{{sfn|LeBar|2002|p=14}}
Judge J. Depue LeBar moved to Shawnee from [[Pahaquarry Township, New Jersey]] in about 1850, and by the end of the decade he'd opened a general store in the village.{{sfn|LeBar|2002|p=13}} In 1888 the River School was built near Shawnee, made of stone and sporting a roof-framing system with wood and iron truss members.{{sfn|Obiso|2008|p=43}}

[[Charles Campbell Worthington]] was a successful businessman, owner of the [[Worthington Corporation|Worthington Pump and Machinery Corporation]].{{sfn|Maurer|1999|p=1}} In the late 1890s Worthington began to spend an increasing amount of time at his country home in Shawnee on Delaware, and in 1900 he retired to live in Shawnee.{{sfn|Davis|2011|p=69}}  In 1904 he built [[Worthington Hall]], later known as the Shawnee Playhouse. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978, but the building was de-listed in 1986 after being demolished following a fire caused by arson on June 24, 1985.{{sfn|History & Mission: Shawnee Playhouse}} 
The playhouse was rebuilt with help from the people of Shawnee on Delaware, the [[Seabee]]s, the Hughes Foundation, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[The National Trust]], a [[Community Development Block Grant]], and others.{{sfn|History & Mission: Shawnee Playhouse}} Charles Campbell Worthington also established the Worthington Society, a society dedicated to ornithology which was directed by Charles W. Miller. The society caught over 300 pigeons on the grounds in less than three months.{{Sfn|Dearborn|1912|p=13}}

==Geography==
[[File:Shawnee.ski.JPG|thumb|right| [[Shawnee Mountain Ski Area]] ]]
The village is just south of the foothills of the [[Pocono Mountains]], and is {{convert|2.6|mi}} southwest of the [[Shawnee Mountain Ski Area]] along a forested valley route.{{sfn|Shawnee on Delaware: Google Maps}}
It is about {{convert|75|mi}} to the west of New York City,{{sfn|Davis|2011|p=69}} and lies {{convert|5.9|mi}} to the northeast of [[Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Shawnee on Delaware: Google Maps}}
The village is separated from the main channel of the Delaware river by Depuy Island. Just downstream from this island is Swanee Island, now the location of the [[The Shawnee Inn & Golf Resort|Shawnee Inn golf course]]. About {{convert|2.5|mi}} upstream from Shawnee is [[Tocks Island]], the site of a proposed [[Tocks Island Dam controversy|controversial dam project]] following flooding on the river in 1955.{{Sfn|United States Army Corps of Engineers|1962|p=99}} The largest [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] tree in the state is situated at Shawnee Presbyterian Church Cemetery, standing {{convert|36|ft}} high and {{convert|67|in|m}} around the trunk, with a {{convert|36|ft}} crown.{{sfn|Fergus|2002|p=44}}

==Demographics and administration==

As of the 2000 census, Shawnee on Delaware had a population of 176 people, of which 90 were male and 86 were female. 171 people were of white ethnicity, 12 people were Hispanic, and 4 people were black. The average house value was $221,400, with an average household income of $46,042.{{sfn|Shawnee on Delaware: Zipcode.org}}

Although Shawnee on Delaware is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] with no municipal or governmental structure of its own, it is subordinate to the local government of [[Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Smithfield Township]] and the county government of [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Michael Barn: Library of Congress}}
The Shawnee Preservation Society is a not-for-profit, voluntary organization, which functions under state law, dedicated to "preserving the quality of life in Shawnee-On-Delaware, Smithfield Township, and surrounding areas".{{sfn|About Us: The Shawnee Preservation Society}}

==Economy==
Lime, produced by burning limestone, was used to neutralize acidity and improve the fertility of the soil in the Shawnee area. One of the local farmers built a lime kiln into a slope on his property; the kiln on [[John Turn Farm]] is well-preserved and is listed as a historic place.{{sfn|Ciba|1992}}{{sfn|John Turn Farm: Library of Congress}} Hiram, son of Judge J. Depue LeBar, farmed about three hundreds across on Shawnee Island, which included land of the present day golf course. A barn, {{convert|110|ft}} long by {{convert|60|ft}} was built which could hold some hundred tons of grain when full, with room to store forty acres of wheat and twenty acres of oats.{{sfn|LeBar|2002|p=13}} A stone mill was also built in the vicinity, the first flour mill in Smithfield Township, which would be ground and loaded onto boats and sold in [[Philadelphia]].{{sfn|LeBar|2002|p=15}}
[[File:John Turn Farm barn.jpg|thumb|John Turn Farm barn, 1970]]

Worthington built the [[Buckwood Inn]], an exclusive resort, with an eighteen-hole golf course designed by [[A. W. Tillinghast]].{{sfn|Davis|2011|p=69}} This later became the Shawnee Country Club.{{sfn|Maurer|1999|p=1}} The course was completed around 1910.{{sfn|Buffington|1935}} In 1913, [[John McDermott (golfer)|John McDermott]] won the Shawnee Open golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, ahead of top Englishmen [[Harry Vardon]] and [[Ted Ray (golfer)|Ted Ray]].{{sfn|Sommers|1996|p=31}} After trying unsuccessfully to keep the fairways in shape by grazing sheep on them, Worthington designed the gang mower with three moving wheels. He launched the [[Shawnee Mower Factory]] to manufacture it.{{sfn|Davis|2011|p=69}}

With the depression the inn's business suffered, and the building was not properly maintained. Worthington's family sold the inn in 1943 to [[Fred Waring]], a famous choral master. Waring made the inn his base, and during the 1950s his radio programs featuring Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians were broadcast from the Worthington Hall.{{sfn|About Shawnee: Shawnee Inn}} During the 1940s and early 1950s, Waring and His Pennsylvanians produced a string of hits, selling millions of records. A few of his many choral hits include "Sleep," "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]," "[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]," "[[Button Up Your Overcoat]]," "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]," "Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor" and "[[Dancing in the Dark (Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz song)|Dancing in the Dark]]."{{sfn|Fred Waring: Library of Congress }} Waring and some of his friends founded Words and Music Inc. in 1939. In 1947 he moved the company to Shawnee and renamed it the [[Shawnee Press]]. The company became a major publisher of sacred and secular music. In 2009 it was acquired by the [[Hal Leonard Corporation]].{{sfn|Shawnee Press - A History of Excellence}}

Many of Waring's celebrity friends visited the inn and played golf. Among them were [[Bob Hope]], [[Art Carney]], [[George Goebel]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Ed Sullivan]], [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Jackie Gleason]]. The golf architect [[Bill Diddle]] expanded the course to 27 holes. Waring sold the inn in 1974 to Philadelphia real estate developer [[Karl Hope]] who expanded the operation and made it less exclusive, introducing timesharing and adding skiing and water activities.{{Sfn|Summa|Summa|Garris|2005|p=58}}{{sfn|About Shawnee: Shawnee Inn}}  Hope established the [[Shawnee Mountain Ski Area]] which contributes to the income received in the Shawnee area, employing Olympic Gold medalist [[Jean-Claude Killy]] as director of ski operations.{{Sfn|Summa|Summa|Garris|2005|p=58}}

==Media==
[[WCSD-LP]] (104.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[low-power FM]] [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[Variety (US radio)|variety]] music format.{{sfn|Station Information Profile: Arbitron}}
The [[Federal Communications Commission]] issued a [[construction permit]] for the station on February 14, 2003.{{sfn|Application Search Details 2003}} The station was assigned the WCSD-LP [[call sign]] on March 18, 2003.{{sfn|Call Sign History}} It received its [[Broadcast license|license to cover]] on November 4, 2004.{{sfn|Application Search Details : FCC}} Licensed to Shawnee-on-Delaware, the station serves the [[Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]] area and is currently owned by Shawnee Presbyterian Church.{{sfn|WCSD-LP Facility Record}}
