Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago-Seattle, 1929, Volume III, pages 781-785.</ref> at 1921 First Avenue in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)]] was originally built as the [[Edgar Ray Butterworth|Butterworth & Sons]] [[mortuary]], which moved into this location in 1903 and moved to larger quarters in 1923.<ref name=Bagley /> Located on a steep hill, the building has only three stories on the First Avenue side, but five on Post Alley.<ref name="The great firm">"The great firm of E. R. Butterworth & Sons", ''Seattle Mail and Herald'', vol. 7, no. 40: Aug. 13, 1904, p. 4-5, 16. Accessed on microfilm at Seattle Public Library.</ref> The building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP); adjacent to [[Pike Place Market]], it falls within the NRHP's Pike Place Public Market Historic District and the city's Place Market Historical District.

The building was the city's first purpose-built mortuary building.<ref name=Bagley /> Jeannie Yandel in 2009 described it as "The city's first place for comprehensive death-related services from corpse retrieval to coffin sales."<ref name=Yandel>Jeannie Yandel, [http://kuow.org/program.php?id=18707 Seattle's Coziest Embalming Room], [[KUOW-FM]], 2009-10-31. Accessed online 2009-11-01. Cited material is in the audio.</ref> Mercedes Yaeger, who runs Market Ghost Tours in Pike Place Market draws an analogy to a later Seattle business founded in the Market, and calls the 1903 mortuary "the [[Starbucks]] of the dead: in the same way Starbucks revolutionized the coffee business, E.R. Butterworth's mortuary revolutionized the death business."<ref name=Yandel /> The building is associated with several ghost stories.<ref name=Yandel /><ref name=Eskanazi /> The building had the first [[elevator]] on the [[West Coast of the United States]], used to transport bodies.<ref name=Yandel /> A ''Seattle Mail and Herald'' account from August 1904, shortly after the building opened calls it "without question of doubt, the most complete establishment of its kind in the United States<U+2026>"<ref name="The great firm" /> A 2008 ''[[Seattle Times]]'' article describes the building, still extant, as "[b]eautifully appointed in stained mahogany, art glass, ornamental plaster and specially designed brass and bronze hardware<U+2026>"<ref name=Eskanazi>Stuart Eskenazi, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pikeplacemarket/2003761417_mymarketghost25m.html Ghost stories haunt Pike Place Market], ''Seattle Times'', June 13, 2008. Accessed online 2009-11-01</ref> The basement, accessible through Post Alley at the rear, is now (as of 2009) home to Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub.<ref name=Yandel /><ref name=Eskanazi/> Several recent accounts describe the Kells space as the former embalming room and crematorium,<ref name=Yandel /><ref name=Eskanazi/> but the 1904 account says that the basement housed the building's heating plant, stables, and a storage space for funeral wagons.<ref name="The great firm" />

==Original configuration==
In the original configuration of the building, the upper floor consisted of three flats for employees of the firm. This floor was reached by a separate entrance at the south end of the First Avenue fa<U+00E7>ade.  The next floor below contained a showroom for [[coffin]]s (caskets), a separate showroom of child-sized coffins, a room of women's burial garments, and a private reception and consulting room. The main showroom of coffins had a view out the back to [[Elliott Bay]]. The 35 caskets on display in August 1904 ranged from [[United States dollar|US$]]25 to 200 in price; garments ranged from a $4 robe to other garments costing as much as $125. These wide ranges of prices were typical of an establishment that intended to serve everyone from the poor to the city's wealthiest families. By policy, those who wished to remain with the bodies of their dead between encoffinment and obsequies were allowed to use the private rooms without additional charge.<ref name="The great firm" />

The next floor down was the main floor facing onto First Avenue. The floor contained private offices, morgues, an embalming room, and a "utensil room" to store canopies, pedestals, rugs, laying-out beds, etc. These rooms were reached through the main entrance. A separate door to the north led to a vestibule and a [[funeral chapel]] with a main floor capacity of 150 and seating for an additional 50 people in the balcony, as well as a separate [[choir]] balcony. An adjacent room for the use of clergy and family had a capacity of about 15, and connected to a "retiring room", which was basically a full bathroom. The room for the use of clergy and family had a private entrance separate from the entrance to the chapel itself. Also on the first floor was a special "best show room" with particularly fine caskets; even in 1904 some of these ranged in price as high as $890.<ref name="The great firm" />

The next floor down<U+2014>below the First Avenue grade, but still above grade on Post Alley<U+2014>contained a "stock room" with fireproof vaults in which bodies could be stored more or less indefinitely. The 1904 ''Seattle Mail and Herald'' account described these as "so much needed in Seattle when people are undecided as to the disposition of the dead", and up to the time of the construction of this building there was no such thing to be had in the city.<ref name="The great firm" /> The basement, level with Post Alley, housed the building's heating plant, stables, and a storage space for funeral wagons.<ref name="The great firm" />
