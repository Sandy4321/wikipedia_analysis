'''Meredith Baxter''' (born June 21, 1947), also known for some years as '''Meredith Baxter-Birney''', is an [[United States|American]] actress and [[Film producer|producer]]. She is known for her acting roles including three [[Television program|television series]]: ''[[Family (TV series)|Family]]'' (1976<U+2013>1980), an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network|television-network]] [[Dramatic programming|drama]], ''[[Family Ties]]'' (1982<U+2013>1989), an [[NBC]] television-network [[situation comedy]], and ''[[Dan Vs.]]'' (2011<U+2013>present), a [[situation comedy]] on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] television-network.

==Early life==
She was born '''Meredith Ann Baxter''' in [[South Pasadena, California]], the daughter of actress turned director/producer [[Whitney Blake]] and Tom Baxter, a [[Radio personality|radio announcer]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Meredith-Baxter.html Meredith Baxter profile at FilmReference.com]. Accessed December 6, 2009</ref> She was raised in Pasadena, with her two brothers, Richard (born 1944) and Brian (born 1946). Her second stepfather was situation-comedy writer [[Allan Manings]].

==Career==
She got her first big break on television in 1972 as one of the stars of ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'', a [[CBS]] television-network situation comedy. The series was canceled after one season, but her co-star, [[David Birney]] became her second husband in 1974.  Following their marriage and until their divorce in 1989, she was credited as '''Meredith Baxter-Birney''', under which name she became widely known several years later on ''Family''. She played the role of Nancy Lawrence Maitland and received two [[Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress <U+2013> Drama Series|Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] (1977 and 1978). 

After ''Family'' ended, she starred with [[Annette O'Toole]] and [[Shelley Hack]] in ''[[Vanities (TV program)|Vanities]]'' (1981), a television production of the [[comedy-drama]] [[Play (theatre)|stage play]] about the lives, loves and friendship of three [[Texas]] [[Cheerleading|cheerleaders]] starting from high school to post-college graduation; it aired as a part of ''[[Standing Room Only (TV series)|Standing Room Only]]'', a series on the [[Pay television|premium-television]] channel [[HBO]]. Her next series was ''Family Ties'', on which she played an ex-[[flower child]] mother, Elyse Keaton. In reality, she is only fourteen years older than [[Michael J. Fox]], who played her son [[Alex Keaton]]. Coincidentally, her co-star [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] (who played her husband Steven Keaton) shares the same birthday, June 21, 1947. 

In 1986, during her time on ''Family Ties'', Baxter garnered critical acclaim for her dramatic performance as Kate Stark in the well-known [[NBC]] television movie ''[[Kate's Secret]]'', about a seemingly "perfect" suburban housewife and mother who is secretly suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]]. Following ''Family Ties'', Baxter (whose marriage to Birney ended in 1989) produced and starred in [[telefilms]]. She portrayed a [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] [[Kidnapping|kidnapper]] in ''The Kissing Place'' (1990) and was nominated for an Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress <U+2013> Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special]] for her work in ''A Woman Scorned: The [[Betty Broderick]] Story'' (1992), based on the true story of a [[divorc<U+00E9>e]] who was convicted of murder in the shooting of her ex-husband and his young wife. In 1994, she won<ref name="MSNBC"/> a [[21st Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmy Award]] for her role as a [[lesbian]] mother raising a young son, in ''Other Mothers'' (1993), a ''[[CBS Schoolbreak Special]]''. For her work on the television film ''My Breast'' (1994), she received a special award for public awareness from the [[National Breast Cancer Coalition]]. In 1997, Baxter once again played the mother of a character played by Michael J. Fox, this time in 2 episodes of ''[[Spin City]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0707015/combined Spin City "Family Affair"] details on IMDb.</ref>

In 2005, she began appearing in [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] for [[Garden State Life Insurance Company]]. In 2006, she temporarily co-hosted <U+2014> with [[Matt Lauer]] <U+2014> ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', the NBC [[Breakfast television|morning news and talk show]]. In 2007, she made a guest appearance on ''[[What About Brian]]'', an ABC drama series. That same year, she also made several appearances as the dying mother of Detective Lilly Rush on ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', a CBS [[police procedural|police-procedural]] series. In recent years, Baxter created a [[cosmetics|skin-care line]] called [http://www.meredithbaxterskincare.com '''Meredith Baxter Simple Works'''], which raises funds for Baxter's [[breast cancer]] research foundation. She is also a spokesperson for Consumer Cellular, a cell phone company advertised as providing a cheaper cell phone alternative for senior citizens. She currently co-stars in ''[[Dan Vs.]]'', which airs on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]].
