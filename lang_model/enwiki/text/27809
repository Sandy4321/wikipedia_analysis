==History==
{{main|History of Germany|Germanic peoples|Germania|List of country name etymologies}}

The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] is assumed to have occurred during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], or at the latest, during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century&nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]]. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their recorded interactions with the [[Roman Empire]], etymological research and archaeological finds.<ref name="Claster">Jill N. Claster: ''Medieval Experience: 300<U+2013>1400''. NYU Press 1982, p. 35. ISBN 0814713815.</ref>

[[Image:Germanic tribes (750BC-1AD).png|thumb|left|Expansion of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] 750 BC <U+2013> AD 1]]

Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germania (a term used by the Romans running roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]) , and it was in this period that the Germanic tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In AD&nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were defeated by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. Modern Germany, as far as the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], thus remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD&nbsp;100, the time of [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]) , occupying most of the area of modern Germany. The 3rd century saw the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Limes and the Danube frontier into Roman-controlled lands.<ref name="Cambridge ancient history">The Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 12, p. 442.

=== Holy Roman Empire (962-1806) ===
{{main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[Image:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|[[Prince-elector]]s of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1341 parchment)]]
The medieval empire stemmed from a division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 843, which was founded by [[Charlemagne]] on [[25 December]] [[800]], and existed in varying forms until 1806, its territory stretching from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south. Often referred to as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (or the Old Empire) , it was officially called the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation ("Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanic<U+00E6>") starting in 1448, to adjust the title to its then reduced territory.

Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919-1024) , the [[Stem duchy|duchies]] of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Bavaria]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. Under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024-1125) , the Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern [[Italy]] and [[Burgundy]], although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Under the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138-1254) , the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]].

[[Image:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der <U+00C4>ltere.jpeg|thumb|left|130px|[[Martin Luther]], (1483<U+2013>1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]]]]

The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire that lasted until its dissolution. It codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. Beginning in the 15th century, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the [[Habsburg]] dynasty of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].

The monk [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] questioning the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1517, thereby sparking the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church was acknowledged as the newly sanctioned religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) , which devastated German lands. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was ''de facto'' divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, the [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1806, the ''Imperium'' was overrun and dissolved as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="concise h">Fulbrook, Mary: ''A Concise History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 97.

=== Restoration and revolution (1814-1871) ===
{{main|German Confederation}}
[[Image:Nationalversammlung.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt Parliament in 1848]]

Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the [[German Confederation]] (Deutscher Bund) , a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, demanding unity and freedom. These, however, were followed by new measures of repression on the part of the Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, profoundly furthered economic unity in the German states. During this era many Germans had been stirred by the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], and [[nationalism]] became a more significant force, especially among young intellectuals. For the first time, the colours of black, red and gold were chosen to represent the movement, which later became the [[Flag of Germany|national colours]].<ref>Martin, Norman. [http://www.fotw.net/flags/de1848.html German Confederation 1815<U+2013>1866 (Germany)] Flags of the World. Oct. 5, 2000. Retrieved 2006, [[December 7|12-07]].</ref>

In light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which successfully established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of [[Emperor]], but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states.

=== German Empire (1871-1918) ===
{{main|German Empire}}
[[Image:Reichsgruendung2.jpg|thumb|right|Foundation of modern Germany in Versailles-France, 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the center in a white uniform.]]

The state known as ''Germany'' was [[political union|unified]] as a modern nation-state in 1871, when the [[German Empire]] was forged, with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as its largest constituent.
After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[German Empire]] ({{lang|de|''Deutsches Kaiserreich''}}) was proclaimed in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on [[18 January]] [[1871]]. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Prussia ruled the new empire, whose capital was [[Berlin]]. The empire was a unification of all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche L<U+00F6>sung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or "Lesser Germany"). Beginning in 1884, Germany began establishing [[List of former German colonies|several colonies]] outside of Europe.

In the {{lang|de|''[[Gr<U+00FC>nderzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I's]] foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[William II, German Emperor|William II]], however, Germany, [[New Imperialism|like other European powers]], took an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had been previously involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country. Specifically, France established new relationships by signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and securing ties with the [[Russian Empire]]. Aside from its contacts with [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany became increasingly isolated.

[[Image:Map-DR-Prussia.svg|left|thumb|Imperial Germany (1871<U+2013>1918) , with the dominant [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in blue.]]

Germany's imperialism reached outside of its own country and joined many other powers in Europe to claim their share of [[Africa]]. The [[Berlin Conference]] divided Africa between the European powers. Germany owned several pieces of land on Africa including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]]. The [[Scramble for Africa]] caused tension between the [[great power]]s that may have contributed to the conditions that led to [[World War I]].

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on [[28 June]] [[1914]] triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. The [[German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] putting an end to the war was signed on [[11 November]] and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war by other means and its harshness is often cited as having facilitated the later rise of [[Nazism]] in the country.<ref name="lee h">Stephen J.

=== Weimar Republic (1919-1933) ===
{{main|Weimar Republic}}

[[Image:Spartacus fight.JPG|right|thumb|The Weimar era was dominated by political and social unrest (Spartacus street fight in 1919)]]

After the success of the [[German Revolution]] in November 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed. The [[Weimar Constitution]] came into effect with its signing by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] on [[11 August]] [[1919]]. The [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] was established by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] in 1918, and the German Workers Party, later known as the National Socialist German Workers Party or [[Nazi Party]], was founded in January 1919.

Suffering from the [[Great Depression]], the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the political masses in Germany increasingly lacked identification with their political system of [[parliamentary democracy]]. This was exacerbated by a wide-spread right-wing ([[Monarchism|monarchist]], ''[[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement|v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'', and Nazi) {{lang|de|''[[Dolchsto<U+00DF>legende]]''}}, a political myth which claimed that Germany lost World War I because of the German Revolution, not because of military defeat. On the other hand, radical left-wing [[communism|communists]], such as the [[Spartacist League]], had wanted to abolish what they perceived as "[[Capitalism|capitalist rule]]" in favour of a {{lang|de|''[[Council communism|R<U+00E4>terepublik]]''}}. Paramilitary troops were set up by several parties and there were thousands of politically motivated murders. The paramilitary intimidated voters and seeded violence and anger among the public, which suffered from high unemployment and poverty. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], seeing little alternative and pushed by right-wing advisors, appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Chancellor of Germany]] on [[30 January]] [[1933]].

=== Third Reich (1933-1945) ===
{{main|Nazi Germany|World War II}}

[[Image:Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] during an official visit to occupied [[Yugoslavia]]]]

On [[27 February]] [[1933]], the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was set on fire]]. Some basic democratic rights were quickly abrogated afterwards under an emergency decree. An [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] gave Hitler's government full legislative power. Only the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] voted against it; the Communists were not able to present opposition, as their deputies had already been murdered or imprisoned.<ref name="Stackelberg">Roderick Stackelberg, ''Hitler's Germany: origins, interpretations, legacies''.

[http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyE1.html Establishing a Dictatorship: The Stabilization of Nazi Power] Colby College. Retrieved 2006, [[7 December|07-12]].</ref> A centralised [[totalitarian]] state was established by a series of moves and decrees making Germany a [[single-party state]]. Industry was closely regulated with quotas and requirements, to shift the economy towards a [[war economy|war production base]]. In 1936 German troops entered the demilitarized [[Rhineland]], and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] policies proved inadequate. Emboldened, Hitler followed from 1938 onwards a policy of [[expansionism]] to establish [[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland|Greater Germany]]. To avoid a two-front war, Hitler concluded the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]], a pact which was later broken by Germany.

In 1939, the [[Causes of World War II|growing tensions from nationalism, militarism, and territorial issues]] led to the Germans [[invasion of Poland (1939)|launching]] a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[September 1]] against [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], followed two days later by declarations of war by Britain and France, marking the beginning of World War II. Germany quickly gained direct or indirect control of [[Occupied Europe|the majority]] of [[Europe]].

[[Image:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]], Potsdamer Platz 1945]]

On [[22 June]] [[1941]], Hitler broke the pact with the Soviet Union by opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]]. Shortly after [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor]], Germany declared war on the [[United States]]. Although initially the German army rapidly advanced into the Soviet Union, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] marked a major turning point in the war. Subsequently, the German army commenced retreating on the Eastern Front. [[Battle of Normandy|D-Day]] marked a major turning point on the Western front, as Allied forces landed on the beaches of [[Normandy]] and made rapid advances into German territory. Germany's defeat soon followed. On [[8 May]] [[1945]], [[Victory in Europe Day|the German armed forces surrendered]] after the [[Red Army]] occupied [[Berlin]].

In what later became known as [[The Holocaust]], the Third Reich regime enacted governmental policies directly subjugating many parts of society: [[Jew]]s, [[Communists]], [[Roma people|Roma]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Freemasonry|freemasons]], political dissidents, priests, preachers, [[Confessing Church|religious opponents]], and the [[disability|disabled]], amongst others. During the Nazi era, about eleven million people were murdered in the Holocaust, including six million Jews and three million [[Poles]]. World War II and the Nazi genocide were responsible for about 35 million dead in Europe.

{{main|History of Germany since 1945}}
[[Image:Deutschland Besatzungszonen - 1945 1946.svg|thumb|right|upright|Allied occupation zones in 1946.]]

The war resulted in the death of nearly ten million German soldiers and civilians; [[Oder-Neisse line|large territorial losses]]; [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|the expulsion of about 15 million Germans]] from its former eastern territories and other countries; and the destruction of multiple major cities. The national territory and [[Berlin]] were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The sectors controlled by [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] were merged on [[23 May]] [[1949]], to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]''; on [[7 October]] [[1949]], the Soviet Zone established the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]''. They were informally known as "[[West Germany]]" and "[[East Germany]]" and the two parts of Berlin as "[[West Berlin]]" and "[[East Berlin]]". The eastern and western countries opted for [[East Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] as their respective capitals. However, West Germany declared the status of its capital Bonn as provisional<ref name="provisional">Britannica http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9080620/Bonn</ref>, in order to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial ''status quo'' that was to be overcome one day.   

West Germany established as a liberal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]", was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country eventually came to enjoy prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1958. Across the border, East Germany was at first occupied by, and later (May 1955) allied with, the USSR. An authoritarian country with a Soviet-style [[command economy]], East Germany soon became the richest, most advanced country in the [[Warsaw Pact]], but many of its citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and economic prosperity.<ref>Colchester, Nico.

[[Image:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] shortly after the opening in 1989]]

In the face of a growing migration of East Germans to West Germany via [[Hungary]] and mass demonstrations during the summer of 1989, East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. Originally intended as a pressure valve to retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the reform process in East Germany, which finally concluded with the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on [[12 September]], [[1990]] and [[German reunification]] on [[3 October]] [[1990]]. Under the terms of the treaty, the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender, and Germany regained full [[sovereignty]].

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Germany}}

[[Image:Deutschland topo.png|thumb|upright|right|Altitude levels]]

Germany has the second largest population in Europe (after European Russia) and is seventh largest in area. The territory of Germany covers {{convert|357021|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|sqkm|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1}} below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major [[river]]s such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].<ref name="CIA">[https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html Germany] CIA Factbook. November 14, 2006. Retrieved 2006, [[November 29|11-29]].</ref> Because of its central location, Germany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west.

===Climate===
[[Image:Hintersee.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alps|Alpine]] scenery in [[Bavaria]]]]

Most of Germany has a temperate climate in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], which is the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea including the peninsula of [[Jutland]] and the area along the Rhine, which flows into the North Sea. Consequently in the north-west and the north, the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]]; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs year round with a maximum during summer. Winters there are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) for prolonged periods. In the east, the climate is more [[continental climate|continental]]; winters can be very cold, summers can be very warm, and long dry periods are often recorded. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. Again, the maximum temperature can exceed 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in summer.<ref>{{cite book | last = Olson | first = Donald | title = Germany For Dummies, 3rd Edition | publisher = Wiley |date=May 2007 | pages = | url = http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-5361.html | id = ISBN 978-0-470-08956-9 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.wordtravels.com/Travelguide/Countries/Germany/Climate/ German Climate and Weather] World Travels.

Nevertheless the country's [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita|carbon dioxide emissions per capita]] is among the highest in the EU but remains significantly lower compared to Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia or the United States.

Emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries contribute to air pollution. Acid rain, resulting from sulphur dioxide emissions is damaging [[forest]]s. Pollution in the Baltic Sea from raw sewage and industrial effluents from rivers in former eastern Germany have been reduced. The government under Chancellor Schr<U+00F6>der announced intent to end the use of nuclear power for producing electricity. Germany is working to meet EU commitment to identify nature preservation areas in line with the EU's Flora, Fauna, and Habitat directive. Germany's last glaciers in Alpine regions is experiencing deglaciation. Natural hazards are river floodings in spring and stormy winds occurring in all regions.

==Government==
{{main|Politics of Germany}}

[[Image:Berlin reichstag CP.jpg|thumb|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] is the old and new site of the German parliament]]

Germany is a [[Federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[Representative democracy|representative]] [[Democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 [[Constitution|constitutional document]] known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]] ([[Basic Law]]). Amendments to the Grundgesetz require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of [[parliament]]; the articles guaranteeing fundamental rights, a democratic state, and the right to resist attempts to overthrow the constitution are valid in perpetuity and cannot be amended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html|title=Article 79 of the ''Grundgesetz''}}</ref> The Grundgesetz remained in effect, with minor amendments, after [[German reunification]] in 1990, despite the intention of the Grundgesetz to be replaced by a proper constitution after the reunion. (This was called Grundgesetz for precisely this reason.)

The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] (currently [[Angela Merkel]]) is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[Executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a [[Prime Minister]]. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council) , which together form a unique type of legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s; the members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the [[States of Germany|sixteen federal states]] and are members of the state cabinets, which appoint them and can remove them at any time.

[[Image:Kanzler21a.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[German Chancellery|Bundeskanzleramt]]'' has been the seat of the German Chancellor since 2001.]]

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] although smaller parties, such as the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the Bundestag since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved 2006, [[December 7|12-07]].</ref>

The German [[head of state]] is the [[President of Germany]], elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the [[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']], who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' itself. He or she is responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor. He or she is nominated by the President of Germany and elected by the ''Bundestag''. If necessary, he or she can be removed by a constructive [[motion of no confidence]] by the ''Bundestag'', where "constructive" implies that the ''Bundestag'' needs to elect a successor.

Germany has played a leading role in the [[European Union]] since its inception and has maintained a [[Franco-German cooperation|strong alliance with France]] since the end of World War II.

Germany's military, the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'', is a defence force with ''[[German Army|Heer]]'' (Army), ''[[German Navy|Marine]]'' (Navy), ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (Air Force), [[Central Medical Services|''Zentraler Sanit<U+00E4>tsdienst'']] (Central Medical Services) and ''[[Streitkr<U+00E4>ftebasis]]'' (Joint Support Service) branches. Military Service is compulsory for men at the age of 18, and conscripts serve nine-month tours of duty. Conscientious objectors may instead opt for an equal length of ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (roughly translated as civilian service), or a six year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a [[Volunteer fire department|fire department]], the [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]] or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|THW]]. In 2003, military spending constituted 1.5% of the country's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].<ref name="CIA"/> In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence, currently [[Franz Josef Jung]].

==Law==
{{main|Judiciary of Germany}}

[[Image:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] in [[Karlsruhe]].]]

The [[Judiciary of Germany]] is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil or statute law system]] that is based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court) , located in Karlsruhe, is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].<ref>[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html Federal Constitutional Court], Bundesverfassungsgericht.de, Accessed April 13, 2007</ref> It acts as the highest legal authority and ensures that legislative and judicial practice conforms to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (Basic Law). It acts independently of the other state bodies, but cannot act on its own behalf.

Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtsh<U+00F6>fe des Bundes'', is specialized. For civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], located in [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Leipzig]]. The courtroom style is [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. Other Federal Courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labor Court]] in [[Erfurt]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]] in [[Kassel]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] in [[Munich]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] in Leipzig.

[[Criminal law]] and [[private law]] are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[B<U+00FC>rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal; its secondary goal is the protection of the general public.<ref>[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stvollzg/__2.html <U+00A7> 2, StVllzg], gesetze-im-internet.de, Accessed April 13, 2007</ref> To achieve the latter, a convicted criminal can be put in preventive detention (''Sicherheitsverwahrung'') in addition to the regular sentence if he is considered to be a threat to the general public. The ''[[V<U+00F6>lkerstrafgesetzbuch]]'' regulates the consequences of [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]] and [[war crimes]]. It gives German courts [[universal jurisdiction]] if prosecution by a court of the country where the crime was committed, or by an international court, is not possible.

===State level===
[[Image:Grundgesetz cover.jpg|thumb|[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], 1949]]

Legislative power is divided between the federation and the state level. The Basic Law presumes that all legislative power remains at the state level unless otherwise designated by the Basic Law itself. In some areas, federal and state level have concurrent legislative power. In such cases, the federate level has power to legislation "if and to the extent that the establishment of equal living conditions throughout the federal territory or the maintenance of legal or economic unity renders federal regulation necessary in the national interest" (Art. 72 Basic Law).

Any federal law overrides state law if the legislative power lies at the federal level. A famous example is the Hessian permission of the death penalty that goes against the ban of capital punishment by the Basic Law. The ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' is the federal organ through which the states participate in national legislation. State participation in federal legislation is necessary if the law falls within the area of concurrent legislative power, requires states to administer federal regulations, or if designated so by the Basic Law. Every state with the exception of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] (whose constitutional jurisdiction is exercised by the ''Bundesverfassungsgericht'' in [[procuration]]) has its own constitutional courts. The ''[[Amtsgericht]]e'', ''Landgerichte'' and ''Oberlandesgerichte'' are state courts of [[general jurisdiction]]. They are competent whether the action is based on federal or state law.

Many of the fundamental matters in [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the states, though most states base their own laws in that area on the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Act) in important points of administrative law. The ''Oberverwaltungsgerichte'' are the highest levels in administrative jurisdiction concerning the state administrations, unless the question of law concerns federal law or state law identical to federal law. In such cases, final appeal to the Federal Administrative Court is possible.

In 2002 Germany was the world's fifth largest consumer of energy, and two-thirds of its primary energy was imported. In the same year, Germany was Europe's largest consumer of electricity; electricity consumption that year totaled 512.9 billion kilowatt-hours.
Government policy emphasizes conservation and the development of [[renewable energy]] sources, such as solar, [[Wind power|wind]], [[biomass]], hydro, and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]]. As a result of energy-saving measures, [[energy efficiency]] (the amount of energy required to produce a unit of gross domestic product) has been improving since the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting half the country's energy demands from renewable sources by 2050. In 2000 the government and the [[Nuclear power in Germany|German nuclear power industry]] agreed to phase out all [[nuclear power plant]]s by 2021.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4295389.stm Germany split over green energy], BBC, Accessed April 13, 2007</ref> However, renewable energy is playing a more modest role in energy consumption.

By its central position in Europe, Germany is an important transportation hub. This is reflected in its dense and modern transportation networks. Probably most famous is the extensive motorway ([[Autobahn]]) network that ranks worldwide third largest in its total length and features lack of blanket speed limits on the majority of routes.

Germany has established a polycentric network of [[high-speed rail|high-speed trains]]. The [[InterCityExpress]] or ''ICE'' is predominantly serving major German cities and destinations in neighbouring countries. The train speed varies from 160&nbsp;km/h to 300&nbsp;km/h and is the most advanced service category of the [[Deutsche Bahn]]. Connections are offered in either 30-minute, hourly or bi-hourly intervals.<ref>[http://www.db.de/site/bahn/de/unternehmen/investor__relations/finanzberichte/geschaeftsbericht/geschaeftsbericht__2006.html Gesch<U+00E4>ftsbericht 2006 der Deutschen Bahn AG], Deutsche Bahn, Retrieved 2007, [[October 19]].</ref>

German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Various German authors and poets have won great renown, including [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularized [[German folklore]] on the international level.

During the last decade of the 20th century Germany has transformed its attitude towards immigrants considerably. Until the mid-nineties the opinion was widespread that Germany is not a country of immigration in spite of an approximately 10% population of non-German origin. After the end of the influx of so-called "[[Gastarbeiter]]" (blue collar guest-workers), refugees were a tolerated exception to this point of view. Today the government and the German society are acknowledging the opinion, that controlled immigration should be allowed based on the qualification of immigrants.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=l9yTtCAnQWwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cdu+immigrant+einwanderungsland&source=web&ots=KKVpfi7CM5&sig=iojK_WCtFX1qxXZepvrllK0j6Vs#PPA53,M1 From ethnic nation to universalistic immigrant integration: Germany] The Integration of Immigrants in European Societies, Retrieved 2008, [[January 06|11-25]].</ref>
