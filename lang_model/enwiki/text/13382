The '''Edward W. Morley House''' is a historic house and [[National Historic Landmark]] at 26 Westland Avenue in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]].  It is notable as the home of the scientist [[Edward W. Morley]] (1838-1923) from 1906 to 1923.  Morley is famous for his collaboration with [[Albert A. Michelson]] on the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] and for his work on the [[atomic weight]]s of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].

==Description and history==
The Morley House is an architecturally undistinguished 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and a single chimney rising from the left side.  The roof is pierced by hip-roofed dormers.  The front of the house is spanned by a single-story porch with a low-pitch hip roof and a gable above the stairs, which rise to the front door.  The house was built in 1906 for [[Edward W. Morley]], who made it his home until his death in 1923, and has reportedly been little altered since then.<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref name="nrhpinv">{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/75002057.pdf |DUPLICATE_title="Edward W.

Morley was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1838, educated at home (his father was a Congregationalist minister and his mother a school teacher).  He graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1860, then studied theology at the [[Andover Theological Seminary]] before eventually accepting a position teaching [[chemistry]] at [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] in 1869.  His reputation as a leading chemist and physicist was cemented during his tenure there, contributing to the apparatus of the famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which proved that light was not carried by any sort of [[luminiferous aether]].   His most significant solo contribution to scientific knowledge was the calculation of the [[atomic weight]]s of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and determining the composition of [[water]] from these elements.  Morley retired in 1905, settling in this house, and continuing to run experiments in a laboratory in the garage until his death in 1923.<ref name="nrhpinv"/>
