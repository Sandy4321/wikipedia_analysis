'''Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology''' ('''ISMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]] organised by the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB). The principal focus of the conference is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems. The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown to become one of the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004.<ref name="Rost2012" /><ref name="Linial2008">{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000094}}</ref> From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years. Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB).

The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]]. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included seven Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB [[Overton Prize]] and [[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] are invited to give keynote talks as part of the programme. The proceedings of the conference are currently published by the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.

==History==
[[File:Larry hunter computer scientist.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white portrait of Lawrence Hunter|[[Lawrence Hunter]], co-chair of the first ISMB conference.]]

===Early meetings===
The origins of the ISMB conference lie in a workshop for [[artificial intelligence]] researchers with an interest in [[molecular biology]] held in November 1991.<ref name="Gibson2012">{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Todd A.|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in ISMB|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e1002679|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002679}}</ref> The workshop was organised by [[United States of America|American]] researcher [[Lawrence Hunter]], then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref name="Searls1994">{{cite journal|last=Searls|first=D.|author2=Shavlik, J. |author3=Hunter, L. |title=The First International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|journal=AI Magazine|year=1994|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12<U+2013>13|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1082/1000|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the [[National Science Foundation]], made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence.<ref name="about-ismb">{{cite web|title=About ISMB|url=http://www.iscb.org/about-ismb|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> Having successfully applied for grants from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and the [[Office of Science#Biological and Environmental Research|Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research]], the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, [[David Searls]] (research associate professor at [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]) and [[Jude Shavlik]] (assistant professor of computer science at [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]]) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries,<ref name="Searls1994" /> submitting 69 scientific papers.<ref name=Gibson2012 />

The success of the first conference prompted the announcement of a second ISMB conference at the end of the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in [[Seattle]]. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at [[Stanford University]] in August 1994 and was organised by [[Russ Altman]], a research scientist at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].<ref name=Gibson2012 /> To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]]. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. [[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]] Board member and Director of the [[Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute]] [[Alfonso Valencia]] has stated that, in 1995, "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology."<ref name=Gibson2012 />

===Formation of ISCB and expansion===
ISMB 1997 was held in [[Halkidiki]], [[Greece]] and marked the foundation of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB).<ref name="about-ismb" /> ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998.<ref name="Linial2008" /> The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) was attended by over 1,000 delegates,<ref name="Rost2012" /> submitting 141 scientific papers.<ref name="Gibson2012" /> This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.<ref name="Rost2012" />

===Partnership with ECCB===
[[File:Wfm secc front.jpg|thumb|alt=The entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|The first joint conference with [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] was held in 2004 at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]].]]
In 2004, ISMB was jointly held with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] for the first time. The conference was also co-located with the Genes, Proteins and Computers conference. This meeting, held in [[Glasgow]], [[UK]], was the largest [[bioinformatics]] conference ever held,<ref name=iscb-history>{{cite web|title=History of ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|work=www.iscb.org|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> attended by 2,136 delegates, submitting 496 scientific papers.<ref name=ismbeccb2004>{{cite web|title=ISMB/ECCB 2004|url=http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2004/|work=ISMB/ECCB 2004|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> Alfonso Valencia considers ISMB/ECCB 2004 to be an important milestone in the history of ISMB: "it was the first one where the balance between Europe and the States became an important part of the conference. It was here that we established the rules and the ways and the spirit of collaboration between the Americans and the Europeans."<ref name="Gibson2012" /> The success of the joint conference paved the way for future European ISMB meetings to be held jointly with ECCB.<ref name="Gibson2012" />

===Recent meetings===
By the end of 2006, ISCB was in financial difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in [[Brisbane]] and ISMB 2006, in [[Fortaleza]]) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction in income.<ref name="Rost2013">{{cite journal|last=Rost|first=B.|title=ISCB: past-present perspective for the International Society for Computational Biology|journal=Bioinformatics|date=14 November 2013|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt629}}</ref> To allow more delegates to attend, it was decided to limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007.<ref name="Linial2008" /> ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. This pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2015. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) marked the first conference for which ISCB took full responsibility for organising.<ref name="Rost2012" /> Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, [[Boston]] (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.<ref name="Rost2012" />

ISMB celebrated its 20th meeting with ISMB 2012, held in [[Long Beach, California]]. This event attracted around 1,600 delegates,<ref name="Rost2012" /> submitting 268 scientific papers.<ref name="Gibson2012" /> Richard H. Lathrop and Lawrence Hunter presented a special keynote presentation, looking back at previous ISMB meetings and attempting to predict where the field of [[bioinformatics]] may head in the future.<ref name=ismb2012>{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012-program/ismb2012-keynotes|work=ISMB 2012|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> ISMB/ECCB 2013 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and was attended by around 2,000 delegates, submitting 233 scientific papers.<ref name="Ben-Tal2013">{{cite journal|last=Ben-Tal|first=N.|title=Editorial|journal=Bioinformatics|date=21 June 2013|volume=29|issue=13|pages=i1<U+2013>i2|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt282}}</ref>

==Format==
===Main conference===
The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]].<ref name="Rost2012" />

[[Academic paper]]s at ISMB were traditionally presented in a single track.<ref name="Gibson2012" /> Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|protein secondary structure prediction]], [[sequence analysis]] and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively.<ref name="Searls1994" /> As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks<ref name="Rost2012" /> including multiple [[proceedings]] tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. [[Christopher Rawlings]] (head of Computational and Systems Biology at [[Rothamsted Research]] and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: "There were a lot of people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn<U+2019>t."<ref name="Gibson2012" /> As the number of submitted [[proceedings]] papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012.<ref name="Gibson2012" /> ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by [[AAAI Press]]. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=ISMB Proceedings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb-proceedings|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunak|first=S.|author2=Krogh, A.|title=ISMB 2001|journal=Bioinformatics|date=1 June 2001|volume=17|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S1<U+2013>S4|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S1}}</ref> The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994;<ref name="Searls1994" /> at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.<ref name="Rost2012" />

[[File:Gunnar von Heijne ISMB 2012 (7803463978).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gunnar von Heijne|[[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] winner [[Gunnar von Heijne]] giving his keynote talk at ISMB 2012.]]
[[Keynote|Keynote talks]] are presented in a single track and generally attract the largest audience.<ref name="Linial2008" /> These presentations are chosen to highlight outstanding research in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Notable [[List of Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology keynote speakers|ISMB keynote speakers]] have included seven [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]]: [[Richard J. Roberts]] (1994, 2006), [[John Sulston]] (1995), [[Manfred Eigen]] (1999), [[Gerald Edelman]] (2000), [[Sydney Brenner]] (2003), [[Kurt W<U+00FC>thrich]] (2006) and [[Robert Huber]] (2006).<ref name=about-ismb /><ref name=Neshich2006>{{cite journal|last=Neshich|first=Goran|author2=Bourne, Philip E. |author3=Brunak, S<U+00F8>ren |title=ISMB 2006|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=1 January 2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e11|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020011}}</ref>

As of 2012, ISMB runs on a budget in excess of $1.5M and, in terms of proceeds, brings in four times that of the other ISCB conferences (ISCB-Latin America, [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Bioinformatics Conference|ISCB-Africa]], ISCB-Asia, Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference, [[CSHALS]] and the Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference) combined.<ref name="Rost2012" /> Standard registration fees (as of 2013) are around $1,000 for academics who are ISCB members ($1,350 for non-members), with lower rates for students and higher rates for corporate delegates respectively. Discounts are provided for early registration.<ref>{{cite web|title=REGISTER|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-registration#registrationfee|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>

===Satellite events===
Pre-conference tutorials have played an important role in ISMB since the first conference.<ref name="Linial2008" /> Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to [[genetic algorithms]], [[neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence|AI]] for molecular biologists and [[molecular biology]] for computer scientists.<ref name="Searls1994" /> Tutorials on computational [[mass spectrometry]]-based [[proteomics]] and [[ENCODE]] data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.<ref name=iscbeccb2013-tutorials>{{cite web|title=Tutorials|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-tutorials|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>

As attendance at ISMB grew in the late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over one or two days before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference.<ref name=ismbeccb2013-sigs>{{cite web|title=SIGs & Satellite Meetings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-satellite-meetings|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> Notable SIG meetings include the [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000<ref name=bosc>{{cite web|title=BOSC - Open Bioinformatics Foundation|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Past_BOSC_conferences|work=http://www.open-bio.org|publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Previous meetings - Bio-ontologies 2013|url=http://www.bio-ontologies.org.uk/previous-meetings|work=Bio-Ontologies 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB.
