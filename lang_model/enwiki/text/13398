{{Space colonization}}
[[Image:Mars Valles Marineris.jpeg|thumb|right|Mars]]
Many believe [[space colonization]] is a desirable and perhaps inevitable step in the future of humanity. [[Mars]] is the focus of much speculation and serious study about possible colonies. It is the second easiest planet to reach from Earth in terms of energy ([[delta V]]) requirements, but a trip there would require several months in space (with current technology, about 6-7 months).

== Similarity to Earth ==

[[Image:Mars Terra2.JPG|thumb|right|275px|An artist's conception of a terraformed Mars. (credit: Mathew Crisp).]]
While Earth is most like neighboring [[Venus]] in bulk composition, [[Mars]]' similarities to [[Earth]] are ultimately more compelling when considering colonization. These include:

* the Martian day (or '''sol''') is very close to Earth's. A Mars [[solar day]] is 24 hours 39 minutes 35.244 seconds. [http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/notes.html] See [[timekeeping on Mars]].
* Mars has a surface area that is 28.4% of Earth's, only slightly less than the amount of dry land on Earth (which is 29.2% of Earth's surface). 
* Mars has an [[axial tilt]] of 25.19<U+00B0>, compared with Earth's 23.44<U+00B0>. As a result, Mars has [[season]]s much like Earth, though they last nearly twice as long because the Martian year is about 1.88 Earth years. The Martian north pole points at [[Cygnus]], not [[Ursa Minor]].
* Mars has an atmosphere. While very thin (about 0.7% of [[Earth's atmosphere]]), it provides some protection from [[solar radiation|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] and  has been used successfully for [[aerobraking]] of spacecraft.
* Recent observations by [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s and [[ESA]]'s [[Mars Express]] confirm the presence of [[water]] on Mars.  Mars appears to have significant quantities of all the [[Chemical element|elements]] necessary to support life.

== Differences ==

There are differences, of course, between Earth and Mars:

* The [[surface gravity]] on Mars is only one third that of Earth. It is not known if this level is high enough to prevent the health problems associated with [[weightlessness]].
* Mars is much colder than Earth, with a mean surface temperature of -63[[degrees Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] and a low of -140<U+00B0>C.
* There are no standing bodies of liquid water on the surface of Mars.
* Because Mars is farther from the [[Sun]], the level of solar energy reaching the surface (the [[solar constant]]) is only about half of what reaches the Earth or the [[Moon]].
* Mars' orbit is more [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] than Earth's, exacerbating temperature and solar constant variations.
* The [[atmospheric pressure]] on Mars is much too low for humans to survive without pressure suits; habitable structures on Mars will need to be constructed with pressure vessels similar to space craft, capable of containing a pressure between a third and a whole bar.
* The Martian atmosphere consists mainly of [[carbon dioxide]]. However the [[partial pressure]] of CO<sub>2</sub> at the surface of Mars is some 52 times higher than on Earth, possibly allowing Mars to support plant life.
* Mars has two moons and they are much smaller and closer to the planet than Earth's Moon. [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] might prove useful as places to test concepts for colonizing the [[asteroid]]s.
* Mars has no [[Magnetosphere]] to deflect [[Solar Wind]]s.

== Habitability ==

Physiologically, Mars's atmosphere may be considered a [[vacuum]]. An unprotected human being would lose consciousness in about 20 seconds and would not survive more than a minute or so on the surface of Mars without a [[space suit]]. 

Still, conditions on Mars are much closer to habitability than the extremely hot and cold temperatures on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the furnace-hot surface of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], or the [[cryogenic]] cold of the [[outer planets]]. Only the cloudtops of Venus are closer in terms of habitability to Earth than Mars is. There are natural settings on Earth where humans have explored that match most conditions on Mars. The highest altitude reached by a [[high altitude balloon|manned balloon]] ascent, a record set in May, 1961, was 34,668 meters (113,740 feet) The pressure at that altitude is about the same as on the surface of Mars. Extreme cold in the Arctic and [[Antarctic]] match all but the most extreme temperatures on Mars. Also, there are [[desert]]s on Earth that look similar to Martian terrain.

===Terraforming of Mars===
{{main|Terraforming of Mars}}
Ultimately, some groups have speculated, Mars might one day be transformed so as to allow a wide variety of living things, including humans, to survive unaided on Mars' surface.  The practicality of [[terraforming]] is still unclear, and its ethics are also disputed.

== Radiation ==

Mars has no global [[geomagnetic field]] comparable to Earth's. Combined with a thin atmosphere, this permits a significant amount of [[ionizing radiation]] to reach the Martian surface. The [[Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft carried an  instrument, the [[Mars Radiation Environment Experiment]] (MARIE), to measure the dangers to humans. MARIE found that radiation levels in orbit above Mars are 2.5 times higher than at the [[International Space Station]].  Average doses were about 22 [[rad (unit)|millirads]] per day (220 [[Gray (unit)|micrograys]] per day or 0.8 gray per year). A three year exposure to such levels would be close to the safety limits currently adopted by NASA. Levels at the Martian surface would be somewhat lower and might vary significantly at different locations depending on altitude and local magnetic fields. 

Occasional [[solar proton event]]s (SPEs) produce much higher doses. Astronauts on Mars could be warned of SPEs by sensors closer to the Sun and presumably take shelter during these events. Some SPEs were observed by MARIE that were not seen by sensors near Earth due to the fact SPEs are directional. This would imply that a network of spacecraft in orbit around the Sun would be needed to ensure all SPEs threatening Mars were detected.

Much remains to be learned about space radiation. In [[2003]], NASA's [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] opened a facility, the [[NASA Space Radiation Laboratory]], at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] that employs [[particle accelerator]]s to simulate space radiation. The facility will study its effects on living organisms along with shielding techniques.

There is some evidence that this kind of low level, chronic radiation is not quite as dangerous as once thought; and that [[radiation hormesis]] occurs<ref>{{cite book|last=Zubrin|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Zubrin|title=The Case for Mars:The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must|publisher=Touchstone|date=1996|id=ISBN 0-684-83550-9|pages=114-116}}</ref>.

The general consensus among those that have studied the issues is that radiation levels, with the exception of the SPEs, that would be experienced on the surface of Mars, and whilst journeying there, are certainly a concern, but are not thought to prevent a trip from being made with current technology<ref>{{cite book|last=Zubrin|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Zubrin|title=The Case for Mars:The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must|publisher=Touchstone|date=1996|id=ISBN 0-684-83550-9|pages=117-121}}</ref>.

== Communication ==

Communications with Earth are relatively straightforward during the half-sol when the Earth is above the Martian horizon. NASA and ESA included communications relay equipment in several of the Mars orbiters, so Mars already has [[communications satellite]]s. While these will eventually wear out, additional orbiters with communication relay capability are likely to be launched before any colonization expeditions are mounted.

The round trip communication delay due to the [[speed of light]] ranges from about 6.5 minutes at closest approach to 44 minutes at superior conjunction. Real-time conversation with Earth, such as [[telephone]] or [[instant messaging]], is not possible, but other means of communication, such as [[e-mail]] and [[voice mail]] pose no difficulty.  Direct communication can be blocked for a few days every [[synodic period]], around the time of [[superior conjunction]] when the [[Sun]] is directly between Mars and Earth.  It should be remembered that the vast majority of exploration and colonization of Earth was conducted without the benefit of real-time communication with "home".  

Ordinary [[Walkie-talkie|two-way radios]] or even [[cell phone]]s will work well over [[line of sight]] distances and their range can be extended using [[radio repeater]]s on high ground or towers. Mars has an [[ionosphere]] that might be used to reflect radio communications between points farther apart on the Martian surface, somewhat like [[short wave]] communication on Earth.  The peak [[plasma frequency]] in the Martian ionosphere is about 1 MHz (at about 150 km),[http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/granada2006/abstracts/Picardi_Granada2006.pdf]  suggesting that would be the [[maximum usable frequency]] for such communications. [http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99435.htm] 

In any case, a constellation of communications satellites, perhaps including a [[Lagrangian point]] satellite located to avoid difficulties during superior conjunction, would be a minor expense in the context of a full-blown Mars colonization program.

== Possible locations for colonies ==

Mars can be considered in broad regions for discussion of possible colony sites.

=== Polar regions ===

Mars' north and south poles once attracted great interest as colony sites because seasonally-varying polar ice caps have long been observed by telescope from Earth. Mars Odyssey found the largest concentration of water near the north pole, but also showed that water likely exists in lower [[latitude]]s as well, making the poles less compelling as a colony locale. Like Earth, Mars sees a [[midnight sun]] at the poles during local summer and [[polar night]] during local winter.

=== Midlands ===

[[Image:Opportunity_-_Cratera_Eagle.jpg|400px]]

The exploration of Mars' surface is still underway. The two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'', have encountered very different soil and rock characteristics. This suggests that the Martian landscape is quite varied and the ideal location for a colony would be better determined when more data becomes available. As on Earth, the further one goes from the equator, the greater the seasonal climate variation one encounters.

=== Valles Marineris === 

[[Image:Valles_Marineris_en_extensi<U+00F3>n.jpg|400px]]

[[Valles Marineris]], the "[[Grand Canyon]]" of Mars, is over 3,000 km long and averages 8 km deep. Atmospheric pressure at the bottom would be some 25% higher than the surface average, 0.9 [[kPa]] vs 0.7 kPa. The canyon runs roughly east-west, so shadows from its walls should not interfere too badly with solar power collection. River channels lead from the canyon, indicating it was once flooded.

===Martian Moons===

Whilst not strictly part of Mars itself, the moons are attractive for some kind of presence. The [[delta-v]] from the moons to an Earth return trajectory is low, and the moons may possess rocket propellant such as water ice in the rock. If so, they could act as refuelling points for vehicles returning to Earth, and would be economically viable to periodically return propellant and other material to cis lunar space. This could help pay for Martian surface settlement.

== Concerns ==

Besides the general criticism of human colonization of space (see [[space colonization]] for a discussion), there are specific concerns about a colony on Mars:

* Some worry about contamination of the planet with Earth life. The question of whether life once existed or exists now on Mars has not been settled. See [[Life on Mars]].
* Radiation levels for trips to and from Mars are very high, quite significantly increasing the risk of cancer, and if child bearing age groups were sent this could possibly create birth defects.
* Many believe Mars might be more economically explored by [[robot]]s, though arguably this does not necessarily preclude later colonization.
* Others suggest the Moon as a more logical first location for a planetary colony, perhaps using it as a staging area for future manned missions to Mars, despite the Moon's extreme poverty in several of the key elements required for life, most notably hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon (50 - 100 ppm).
* It is unknown whether martian gravity can support human life in the long term (all experience is at either 1g or zero gravity). Space medicine researchers have theorized on whether the health benefits of gravity rise slowly or quickly between weightlessness and full Earth gravity. The [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]] experiment is due to become the first experiment testing the effects of partial gravity, artificially generated at 0.38 [[Acceleration due to gravity|g]] to match Mars gravity, on mammal life, specifically on mice, throughout the life cycle from conception to death.
* Mars' escape velocity is 5 km/s, which, though less than half that for Earth, is reasonably high compared to the Moon's 2.38 km/s or the negligible escape velocity of most asteroids. This could make physical export trade from Mars to other planets and habitats less viable economically.
