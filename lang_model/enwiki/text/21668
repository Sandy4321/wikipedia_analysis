In India, he is recognized as the ''[[Father of the Nation]]''.  October 2nd, his birthday, is commemorated each year as ''[[Gandhi Jayanti]]'', and is a [[holidays in India|national holiday]]. He was the pioneer of ''[[Satyagraha]]'' <U+2014> the resistance of [[tyranny]] through mass [[civil disobedience]], firmly founded upon [[ahimsa]] or total [[non-violence]] <U+2014> which led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is commonly known in India and across the world as '''Mahatma Gandhi''' ({{lang-hi| <U+092E><U+0939><U+093E><U+0924><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E>, m<U+0259>hatma}} ; from [[Sanskrit]], ''[[Mahatma|mah<U+0101>tm<U+0101>]]'': ''Great Soul'') and as ''Bapu'' (in Gujarati, ''Father''). 

As a British-educated [[lawyer]], Gandhi first employed his ideas of peaceful civil disobedience in the Indian community's struggle for civil rights in [[South Africa]]. Upon his return to India, he organized poor farmers and labourers to protest against oppressive taxation and widespread discrimination. Assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]], Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for the alleviation of poverty, for the liberation of women, for brotherhood amongst differing religions and ethnicities, for an end to [[untouchability]] and caste discrimination, and for the economic self-sufficiency of the nation, but above all for ''[[Swaraj]]'' <U+2014> the independence of India from foreign domination. Gandhi famously led Indians in the disobedience of the salt tax on the 400 kilometre (248 miles) [[Salt Satyagraha|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930, and in an open call for the British to ''[[Quit India]]'' in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years on numerous occasions in both South Africa and India. 

Throughout his life, Gandhi remained committed to [[non-violence]] and [[truth]] even in the most extreme situations.  A student of [[Hindu philosophy]], he lived simply, organizing an [[Sabarmati Ashram|ashram]] that was self-sufficient in its needs.  Making his own clothes <U+2014> the traditional Indian [[dhoti]] and shawl woven with a [[charkha]], he lived on a simple [[vegetarian]] diet.  He used rigorous [[fasts]], for long periods, for both self-purification and protest.  Gandhi's life and teachings inspired [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Steve Biko]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and through them the [[American civil rights movement]] and the freedom struggles in [[South Africa]] and [[Myanmar]] respectively.

== Early life ==
'''Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi''' was born into the [[Hindu]] [[Modh]] family in [[Porbandar]], in 1869. He was the son of Karamchand Gandhi, the ''[[Diwan (title)|diwan]]'' (Prime Minister) of Porbandar, and Putlibai, Karamchand's fourth wife, a Hindu of the Pranami [[Vaishnava]] order. Karamchand's first two wives, who each bore him a daughter, died from unknown reasons (rumored to be in childbirth). Living with a devout mother and surrounded by the [[Jainism|Jain]] influences of Gujarat, Gandhi learned from an early age the tenets of non-injury to living beings, [[vegetarianism]], [[fasting]] for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between members of various creeds and sects. He was born into the ''[[vaishya]]'', or business, [[caste]]. 
[[Image:Gandhi and Kasturbhai 1902.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Gandhi and his wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] (1902)]] 
In May 1883, at the age of 13, Gandhi was married through his parents' arrangements to [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba Makhanji]] (also spelled "Kasturbai" or known as "Ba"). They had four sons: [[Harilal Gandhi]], born in [[1888]]; [[Manilal Gandhi]], born in [[1892]]; [[Ramdas Gandhi]], born in [[1897]]; and [[Devdas Gandhi]], born in [[1900]]. Gandhi was a mediocre student in his youth at Porbandar and later [[Rajkot]]. He barely passed the [[Matriculation|matriculation exam]] for Samaldas College at Bhavanagar, Gujarat.  He was also unhappy at the college, because his family wanted him to become a [[barrister]].

At the age of 18 on [[September 4]] [[1888]], Gandhi went to [[University College London]] to train as a [[barrister]]. His time in [[London, United Kingdom|London]], the Imperial capital, was influenced by a vow he had made to his mother in the presence of the Jain monk Becharji, upon leaving India, to observe the Hindu precepts of abstinence from meat, alcohol, and promiscuity. Although Gandhi experimented with adopting "English" customs <U+2014> taking dancing lessons for example <U+2014> he could not stomach his landlady's mutton and cabbage. She pointed him towards one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Rather than simply go along with his mother's wishes, he read about, and intellectually embraced [[vegetarianism]]. He joined the [[Vegetarian Society]], was elected to its executive committee, and founded a local chapter. He later credited this with giving him valuable experience in organizing institutions. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in [[1875]] to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[Brahman]]istic literature. They encouraged Gandhi to read the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. Not having shown a particular interest in religion before, he read works of and about [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and other religions. He returned to India after being called to the [[bar association|bar]] of [[England and Wales]] by [[Inner Temple]], but had limited success establishing a law practice in [[Bombay]].  Later, after applying and being turned down for a part-time job as a high school teacher, he ended up returning to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but was forced to close down that business as well when he ran afoul of a British officer. In his autobiography, he describes this incident as a kind of unsuccessful lobbying attempt on behalf of his older brother. It was in this climate that (in [[1893]]) he accepted a year-long contract from an Indian firm to a post in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], [[South Africa]].

[[Image:Gandhisouthafrica.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gandhi in [[South Africa]] (1895)]] 

South Africa changed Gandhi dramatically, as he faced the discrimination commonly directed at blacks and Indians. One day in court at [[Durban]], the magistrate asked him to remove his [[turban]]. Gandhi refused and stormed out of the courtroom. He was thrown off a train at [[Pietermaritzburg]], after refusing to move from the first class to a third class coach while holding a valid first class ticket. Traveling further on by stagecoach, he was beaten by a driver for refusing to travel on the foot board to make room for a European passenger. He suffered other hardships on the journey as well, including being barred from many hotels. These incidents have been acknowledged by several biographers as a turning point in his life, explaining his later social activism. It was through witnessing firsthand the [[racism]], [[prejudice]] and injustice against Indians in South Africa that Gandhi started to question his people's status, and his own place in society. However, these events by no means explain why he inculcated non-violence instead of aggressive revolution.

{{See also|Indian Independence Movement}}
He spoke at the conventions of the [[Indian National Congress]], but was primarily introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], a respected leader of the Congress Party at the time.

===Champaran and Kheda===
{{Main|Champaran and Kheda Satyagraha}}
[[Image:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran satyagrahas.]]
Gandhi's first major achievements came in [[1918]] with the [[Champaran]] agitation and ''Kheda Satyagraha'', although in the latter it was [[Indigo plant|indigo]] and other cash crops instead of the food crops necessary for their survival. Suppressed by the militias of the landlords (mostly British), they were given measly compensation, leaving them mired in extreme poverty. The villages were kept extremely dirty and [[Hygiene|unhygienic]]; and alcoholism, [[untouchability]] and [[purdah]] were rampant. Now in the throes of a devastating famine, the British levied an oppressive tax which they insisted on increasing. The situation was desperate. In [[Kheda]] in [[Gujarat]], the problem was the same. Gandhi established an [[ashram]] there, organizing scores of his veteran supporters and fresh volunteers from the region. He organized a detailed study and survey of the villages, accounting for the atrocities and terrible episodes of suffering, including the general state of degenerate living. Building on the confidence of villagers, he began leading the clean-up of villages, building of schools and hospitals and encouraging the village leadership to undo and condemn many social evils, as accounted above.

But his main impact came when he was arrested by police on the charge of creating unrest and was ordered to leave the province. Hundreds of thousands of people protested and rallied outside the jail, police stations and courts demanding his release, which the court reluctantly granted. Gandhi led organized protests and strikes against the landlords, who with the guidance of the British government, signed an agreement granting the poor farmers of the region more compensation and control over farming, and cancellation of revenue hikes and its collection until the famine ended. It was during this agitation, that Gandhi was addressed by the people as ''Bapu'' (Father) and ''Mahatma'' (Great Soul). In Kheda, [[Sardar Patel]] represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners. As a result, Gandhi's fame spread all over the nation.

== Non-cooperation ==
{{Main|Non-cooperation movement}}

Non-cooperation and peaceful resistance were Gandhi's "weapons" in the fight against injustice. In [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] of civilians by British troops caused deep trauma to the nation, leading to increased public anger and acts of violence. Gandhi criticized both the actions of the [[British Raj]] and the retaliatory violence of Indians. He authored the resolution offering condolences to British civilian victims and condemning the riots, which after initial opposition in the party, was accepted following Gandhi's emotional speech advocating his principle that all violence was evil and could not be justified.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 82.</ref> But it was after the massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhi's mind focused upon obtaining complete self-government and control of all Indian government institutions, maturing soon into ''[[Swaraj]]'' or complete individual, spiritual, political independence. 

In December [[1921]], Gandhi was invested with executive authority on behalf of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Under his leadership, the Congress was reorganized with a new constitution, with the goal of ''Swaraj''. Membership in the party was opened to anyone prepared to pay a token fee.  A hierarchy of committees was set up to improve discipline, transforming the party from an elite organization to one of mass national appeal. Gandhi expanded his non-violence platform to include the [[Swadeshi movement|''swadeshi'' policy]] &ndash; the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that ''[[khadi]]'' (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning ''khadi'' in support of the independence movement.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 89.</ref> This was a strategy to inculcate discipline and dedication to weed out the unwilling and ambitious, and to include women in the movement at a time when many thought that such activities were not respectable activities for women.  In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and [[British honours system|honours]].

"Non-cooperation" enjoyed wide-spread appeal and success, increasing excitement and participation from all strata of Indian society. Yet, just as the movement reached its apex, it ended abruptly as a result of a violent clash in the town of [[Chauri Chaura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], in February [[1922]].  Fearing that the movement was about to take a turn towards violence, and convinced that this would be the undoing of all his work, Gandhi called off the campaign of mass civil disobedience.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 105.</ref> Gandhi was arrested on [[March 10]], 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years imprisonment.  Beginning on [[March 18]], 1922, he only served about two years of the sentence, being released in February [[1924]] after an operation for [[appendicitis]]. 

Without Gandhi's uniting personality, the Indian National Congress began to splinter during his years in prison, splitting into two factions, one led by [[Chitta Ranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], opposing this move.  Furthermore, cooperation among Hindus and Muslims, which had been strong at the height of the non-violence campaign, was breaking down. Gandhi attempted to bridge these differences through many means, including a three-week fast in the autumn of 1924, but with limited success.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 131.</ref>

== Swaraj and the Salt Satyagraha ==
{{main|Salt Satyagraha}}
[[Image:Gandhi Satyagraha.JPG|thumb|200px|Gandhi at a public rally during the [[Salt Satyagraha]].]]
Gandhi stayed out of the limelight for most of the [[1920s]], preferring to resolve the wedge between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress, and expanding initiatives against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty. He returned to the fore in [[1928]]. The year before, the British government had appointed a new constitutional reform commission under Sir John Simon, with not a single Indian in its ranks. The result was a boycott of the commission by Indian political parties. Gandhi pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-violence with complete independence for the country as its goal. Gandhi had not only moderated the views of younger men like [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who sought a demand for immediate independence, but also modified his own call to a one year wait, instead of two.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 172.</ref> The British did not respond. On [[December 31]] [[1929]], the flag of India was unfurled in Lahore. [[January 26]] [[1930]] was celebrated by the Indian National Congress, meeting in Lahore, as India's Independence Day. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organization. Making good on his word, he launched a new satyagraha against the tax on salt in March [[1930]], highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi from [[March 12]] to [[April 6]], marching 400 kilometres (248 miles) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself. Thousands of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting British rule; Britan responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people.
[[Image:Gandhi Downing Street.jpg|thumb|left|200px|At 10 Downing St., 1931]]
The government, represented by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Edward Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]] was signed in March [[1931]]. The British Government agreed to set all political prisoners free in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. Furthermore, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists, as it focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than the transfer of power. Furthermore, Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], embarked on a new campaign of repression against the nationalists. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government attempted to destroy his influence by completely isolating him from his followers. This tactic was not successful. In [[1932]], through the campaigning of the Dalit leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the government granted untouchables separate electorates under the new constitution. In protest, Gandhi embarked on a six-day fast in September 1932, successfully forcing the government to adopt a more equitable arrangement via negotiations mediated by the Dalit cricketer turned political leader Palwankar Baloo. This was the start of a new campaign by Gandhi to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he named Harijans, the children of God. On [[May 8]] [[1933]] Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 230-32.</ref> 

In the summer of [[1934]], three unsuccessful attempts were made on his life.

When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accept power under the Federation scheme, Gandhi decided to resign from party membership. He did not disagree with the party's move, but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, that actually varied from communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, to those with pro-business convictions. Gandhi also did not want to prove a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 246.</ref>

Gandhi returned to the head in [[1936]], with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi desired a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Bose, who had been elected to the presidency in [[1938]]. Gandhi's main points of contention with Bose were his lack of commitment to democracy, and lack of faith in non-violence. Bose won his second term despite Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest against his abandonment of the principles introduced by Gandhi.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 277-81.</ref>

== World War II and ''Quit India'' ==
{{Main|Quit India Movement}} 
[[Image:Mahadev Desai and Gandhi 2 1939.jpg|right|thumb|210px|[[Mahadev Desai]] (left) reading out a letter to Gandhi from the [[viceroy]] at Birla House, Mumbai, [[April 7]], [[1939]].]]
[[World War II]] broke out in [[1939]] when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded [[Poland]]. Initially, Gandhi had favored offering "non-violent moral support" to the British effort, but other Congressional leaders were offended by the unilateral inclusion of India into the war, without consultation of the people's representatives. All Congressmen elected to office resigned en masse.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 283-86.</ref> After lengthy deliberations, Gandhi declared that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom, while that freedom was denied in India herself. As the war progressed, Gandhi increased his demands for independence, drafting a resolution calling for the British to ''[[Quit India]]''. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from Indian shores.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 309.</ref>

[[Image:Nehruwithgandhi1942.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] sitting next to Gandhi at the AICC General Session, 1942]]Gandhi was criticized by some Congress party members and other Indian political groups, both pro-British and anti-British. Some felt that opposing Britain in its life-death struggle was immoral, and others felt that Gandhi wasn't doing enough. ''Quit India'' became the most forceful movement in the history of the struggle, with mass arrests and violence on an unprecedented scale.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 318.</ref> Thousands of freedom fighters were killed or injured by police gunfire, and hundreds of thousands were arrested. Gandhi and his supporters made it clear they would not support the war effort unless India were granted immediate independence. He even clarified that this time the movement would not be stopped if individual acts of violence were committed, saying that the ''"ordered anarchy"'' around him was ''"worse than real anarchy."'' He called on all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline via [[ahimsa]], and ''Karo Ya Maro'' ("Do or Die") in the cause of ultimate freedom. 

Gandhi and the entire Congress Working Committee were arrested in [[Bombay]] by the British on [[August 9]], [[1942]]. Gandhi was held for two years in the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in [[Pune]]. It was here that Gandhi suffered two terrible blows in his personal life. His 42-year old secretary [[Mahadev Desai]] died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba died after 18 months imprisonment in February [[1944]]; six weeks later Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack.  He was released before the end of the war on [[May 6]] 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation. Although Quit India movement had moderate success in its objective, the ruthless suppression of the movement brought order to India by the end of [[1943]]. At the end of the war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.

== Freedom and partition of India ==

{{Main|Partition of India}}
<!--- With Mahatma Gandhi (right) in Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]) in 1944.]] what's this?-->
Gandhi advised the Congress to reject the proposals the [[British Cabinet Mission]] offered in 1946, as he was deeply suspicious of the ''grouping'' proposed for Muslim-majority states <U+2014> Gandhi viewed this as a precursor to partition. However, this became one of the few times the Congress broke from Gandhi's advice (though not his leadership), as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan, the control of government would pass to the [[Muslim League]]. Between [[1946]] and [[1948]]
, over 5,000 people were killed in violence. Gandhi was vehemently opposed to any plan that partitioned India into two separate countries. An overwhelming majority of Muslims living in India, side by side with Hindus and Sikhs, were in favour of Partition. Additionally [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the leader of the Muslim League, commanded widespread support in [[Punjab, Pakistan|West Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[NWFP]] and [[East Bengal]]. The partition plan was approved by the Congress leadership as the only way to prevent a wide-scale Hindu-Muslim civil war. Congress leaders knew that Gandhi would viscerally oppose partition, and it was impossible for the Congress to go ahead without his agreement, for Gandhi's support in the party and throughout India was strong. Gandhi's closest colleagues had accepted partition as the best way out, and [[Sardar Patel]] endeavoured to convince Gandhi that it was the only way to avoid civil war. A devastated Gandhi gave his assent. 

On the day of the transfer of power, Gandhi did not celebrate independence with the rest of India, but was alone in [[Calcutta]], mourning the partition and working to end the violence. After India's independence, Gandhi focused on Hindu-Muslim peace and unity. He conducted extensive dialogue with Muslim and Hindu community leaders, working to cool passions in northern India, as well as in [[Bengal]]. Despite the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]], he was troubled when the Government decided to deny Pakistan the [[Indian Rupee|Rs.]] 55 [[crore]]s due as per agreements made by the Partition Council. Leaders like [[Sardar Patel]] feared that Pakistan would use the money to bankroll the war against India. Gandhi was also devastated when demands resurged for all Muslims to be deported to Pakistan, and when Muslim and Hindu leaders expressed frustration and an inability to come to terms with one another.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 462.</ref> He launched his last fast-unto-death in [[Delhi]], asking that all communal violence be ended once and for all, and that the payment of Rs. [[Indian numbering system|55 crores]] be made to Pakistan. Gandhi feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase their anger against India, and violence would spread across the borders. He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity and precipitate into an open civil war. After emotional debates with his life-long colleagues, Gandhi refused to budge, and the Government rescinded its policy and made the payment to Pakistan. Hindu, Muslim and Sikh community leaders, including the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] and [[Hindu Mahasabha]] assured him that they would renounce violence and call for peace. Gandhi thus broke his fast by sipping orange juice.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 464-66.</ref>

[[Image:GandhisLastJourney.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A press photo published in The Manchester Guardian, February 18, 1948, showing Mahatma Gandhi's ashes being carried through the streets of Allahabad.]]

On [[January 30]], [[1948]], on his way to a prayer meeting, Gandhi was shot and killed in [[Birla House]], [[New Delhi]], by [[Nathuram Godse]]. Godse was a Hindu radical with links to the extremist [[Hindu Mahasabha]], who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan.<ref>R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 472.</ref> Godse and his co-conspirator [[Narayan Apte]] were later tried and convicted; they were executed on [[15 November]], [[1949]]. Gandhi's memorial (or ''Sam<U+0101>dhi'') at [[Raj Ghat and other memorials|R<U+0101>j Gh<U+0101>t]], [[New Delhi]], bears the epigraph, ([[Devanagari]]: ''<U+0939><U+0947> ! <U+0930><U+093E><U+092E>'' or, ''He [[Rama|{{IAST|R<U+0101>m}}]]''), which may be translated as "Oh God". These are widely believed to be Gandhi's last words after he was shot, though the veracity of this statement has been disputed.<ref>Vinay Lal.

Humanscape 8, no. 1 (January 2001): pp. 34-38.</ref> [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] addressed the nation through radio:
<blockquote>
Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more.  Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country."<ref>[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Light_Has_Gone_Out Nehru's address on Gandhi's death]. Retrieved on [[March 15]] [[2007]].</ref>
</blockquote>
According to his wish, the majority of Gandhi's ashes were immersed in some the world's major rivers, such as [[The Nile]], [[Volga]], [[Thames]], etc. A small portion was sent to [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] from Dr. V.M. Nawle, (a publisher and journalist from Poona, India) encased in a brass & silver coffer. The ashes were then enshrined at the Mahatma Gandhi World Peace Memorial in the [[Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine]] within a thousand-year-old stone sarcophagus from [[China]].

== Gandhi's principles ==
{{See also|Gandhism}}

===Truth===
Gandhi dedicated his life to the wider purpose of discovering [[truth]], or ''[[Satya]]''. He tried to achieve this by learning from his own mistakes and conducting experiments on himself. He called his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''. 

Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities.  Gandhi summarized his beliefs first when he said "[[God]] is Truth".  He would later change this statement to "Truth is God". Thus, ''Satya'' (Truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".

===Nonviolence===
The concept of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]'') and [[nonresistance]] has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''.  He was quoted as saying:

:"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall <U+2014> think of it, always."

:"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?"

:"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."

:"There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for."

In applying these principles, Gandhi did not balk from taking them to their most logical extremes. In 1940, when invasion of the British Isles by Nazi Germany looked imminent, Gandhi offered the following advice to the British people (''Non-Violence in Peace and War''):<ref>{{cite book | last =Gandhi | first =Mahatma | authorlink =Mahatma Gandhi | title =Non-violence in peace and war, 1942-[1949] | publisher =Garland Pub | date =1972 | id =ISBN 0-8240-0375-6 }}</ref>

:"I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions.... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."

However, Gandhi was aware that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he realized not everyone possessed.  He therefore advised that everyone need not keep to nonviolence, especially if it was used as a cover for cowardice:

:"Gandhi guarded against attracting to his ''satyagraha'' movement those who feared to take up arms or felt themselves incapable of resistance. 'I do believe,' he wrote, 'that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence.'"<ref>Bondurant, p. 28.</ref>

:"At every meeting I repeated the warning that unless they felt that in non-violence they had come into possession of a force infinitely superior to the one they had and in the use of which they were adept, they should have nothing to do with non-violence and resume the arms they possessed before. It must never be said of the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]s that once so brave, they had become or been made cowards under [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Badshah Khan]]'s influence. Their bravery consisted not in being good marksmen but in defying death and being ever ready to bare their breasts to the bullets."<ref>Bondurant, p. 139.</ref>

===Vegetarianism===
As a young child, Gandhi experimented with meat-eating. This was due partially to his inherent curiosity as well as his rather persuasive peer and friend Sheikh Mehtab. The idea of [[vegetarianism]] is deeply engrained in Hindu and [[Jain]] traditions in India, and, in his native land of [[Gujarat]], most Hindus were vegetarian. The Gandhi family was no exception. Before leaving for his studies in London, Gandhi made a promise to his mother, Putlibai and his uncle, Becharji Swami that he would abstain from eating meat, taking alcohol, and engaging in promiscuity. He held fast to his promise and gained more than a diet, he gained a basis for his life-long philosophies. As Gandhi grew into adulthood, he became a strict [[Lacto vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. He wrote the book ''The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism'' [http://www.memoware.com/temp/2007128_8/14426/The_Moral_Basis-Text.txt] and several articles on the subject, some of which were published in the London Vegetarian Society's publication, ''The Vegetarian'' [http://www.ivu.org/history/gandhi/]. Gandhi, himself, became inspired by many great minds during this period and befriended the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society, Dr. Josiah Oldfield.

Having also read and admired the work of [[Henry Stephens Salt]], the young Mohandas met and often corresponded with the vegetarian campaigner. Gandhi spent much time advocating vegetarianism during and after his time in London. To Gandhi, a vegetarian diet would not only satisfy the requirements of the body, it would also serve an economic purpose as meat was, and still is, generally more expensive than grains, vegetables, and fruits.  Also, many Indians of the time struggled with low income, thus vegetarianism was seen not only as a spiritual practice but also a practical one. He abstained from eating for long periods, using [[fasting]] as a form of political protest. He refused to eat until his death or his demands were met. It was noted in his autobiography that vegetarianism was the beginning of his deep commitment to [[Brahmacharya]]; without total control of the palate, his success in Bramacharya would likely falter.

===Brahmacharya===

This decision was deeply influenced by the philosophy of [[Brahmacharya]] <U+2014> spiritual and practical purity <U+2014> largely associated with celibacy and [[asceticism]].  Gandhi saw brahmacharya as a means of going close to God and as a primary foundation for self realization. In his autobiography he tells of his battle against lustful urges and fits of jealousy with his childhood bride, [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]].  He felt it his personal obligation to remain celibate so that he could learn to love, rather than lust. For Gandhi, brahmacharya meant "control of the senses in thought, word and deed."<ref>[http://www.mahatma.org.in/books/showbook.jsp?id=188&link=bg&book=bg0001&lang=en&cat=books The Story of My Experiments with Truth <U+2014> An Autobiography], p. 176.</ref>

===Simplicity===
[[Image:GandhiStatueInUnionSquareNYC.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Union Square Park, New York City]]

Gandhi earnestly believed that a person involved in social service should lead a [[simple living|simple life]] which he thought could lead to Brahmacharya. His [[simplicity]] began by renouncing the western lifestyle he was leading in South Africa. He called it "reducing himself to zero," which entailed giving up unnecessary expenditure, embracing a simple lifestyle and washing his own clothes.<ref>[http://www.mahatma.org.in/books/showbook.jsp?id=189&link=bg&book=bg0001&lang=en&cat=books The Story of My Experiments with Truth <U+2014> An Autobiography], p. 177.</ref> On one occasion he returned the gifts bestowed to him from the natals for his diligent service to the community.<ref>[http://www.mahatma.org.in/books/showbook.jsp?id=195&link=bg&book=bg0001&lang=en&cat=bookss The Story of My Experiments with Truth <U+2014> An Autobiography], p. 183.</ref>

Gandhi spent one day of each week in silence. He believed that abstaining from speaking brought him [[inner peace]]. This influence was drawn from the Hindu principles of ''mauna'' ([[Sanskrit]]:{{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+094C><U+0928><U+0902>}} - silence) and ''shanti'' (peace). On such days he communicated with others by writing on paper. For three and a half years, from the age of 37, Gandhi refused to read newspapers, claiming that the tumultuous state of world affairs caused him more confusion than his own inner unrest. 

Upon returning to India from South Africa, where he had enjoyed a successful legal practice, he gave up wearing Western-style clothing, which he associated with wealth and success. He dressed to be accepted by the poorest person in India, advocating the use of homespun cloth (''khadi''). Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes from thread they themselves spun, and encouraged others to do so.  While Indian workers were often idle due to unemployment, they had often bought their clothing from industrial manufacturers owned by British interests. It was Gandhi's view that if Indians made their own clothes, it would deal an economic blow to the British establishment in India. Consequently, the [[spinning wheel]] was later incorporated into the flag of the Indian National Congress. He subsequently wore a [[dhoti]] for the rest of his life to express the simplicity of his life.

===Faith===
Gandhi was born a Hindu and practised [[Hinduism]] all his life, deriving most of his principles from Hinduism. As a common Hindu, he believed all religions to be equal, and rejected all efforts to convert him to a different faith. He was an avid theologian and read extensively about all major religions. He had the following to say about Hinduism:
:"Hinduism as I know it entirely satisfies my soul, fills my whole being ... When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and when I see not one ray of light on the horizon, I turn to the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', and find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming sorrow. My life has been full of tragedies and if they have not left any visible and indelible effect on me, I owe it to the teachings of the ''Bhagavad Gita''."

Gandhi wrote a commentary on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]].  The Gujarati manuscript was translated into [[English language|English]] by Mahadev Desai, who provided an additional introduction and commentary.  It was published with a Foreword by Gandhi in 1946.<ref>Desai, Mahadev. The Gospel of Selfless Action, or, The Gita According To Gandhi. (Navajivan Publishing House: Ahmedabad: First Edition 1946).  Other editions: 1948, 1951, 1956.</ref><ref>A shorter edition, omitting the bulk of Desai's additional commentary, has been published as: Anasaktiyoga: The Gospel of Selfless Action. Jim Rankin, editor.  The author is listed as M.K. Gandhi; Mahadev Desai, translator.  (Dry Bones Press, San Francisco, 1998) ISBN 1-883938-47-3.</ref> 

Gandhi believed that at the core of every religion was truth and love (compassion, nonviolence and [[Ethic of reciprocity|the Golden Rule]]). He also questioned hypocrisy, malpractices and dogma in all religions and was a tireless social reformer. Some of his comments on various religions are:

:"Thus if I could not accept [[Christianity]] either as a perfect, or the greatest [[religion]], neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. If untouchability could be a part of Hinduism, it could but be a rotten part or an excrescence. I could not understand the raison d'etre of a multitude of sects and [[caste]]s. What was the meaning of saying that the [[Vedas]] were the inspired [[Sacred text|Word of God]]? If they were inspired, why not also the [[Bible]] and the [[Qur'an|Koran]]? As Christian friends were endeavouring to convert me, so were [[Muslim]] friends. Abdullah Sheth had kept on inducing me to study [[Islam]], and of course he had always something to say regarding its beauty." (source: [[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|his autobiography]])

:"As soon as we lose the moral basis, we cease to be religious. There is no such thing as religion over-riding morality. Man, for instance, cannot be untruthful, cruel or incontinent and claim to have God on his side."

:"The sayings of [[Muhammad]] are a treasure of wisdom, not only for Muslims but for all of mankind." 

Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:

:"Yes I am.  I am also a Christian, a Muslim, a [[Buddhist]] and a [[Jew]]."

In spite of their deep reverence to each other, Gandhi and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] got involved in protracted debates more than once. These debates exemplify the philosophical differences between the two most famous Indians at the time. On [[January 15]] [[1934]], an earthquake hit [[Bihar]] and caused extensive damage and loss of life. Gandhi maintained this was because of the sin committed by upper caste [[Hindu]]s by not letting untouchables in their temples (Gandhi was committed to the cause of improving the fate of untouchables, referring to them as Harijans, people of [[Krishna]]). [[Tagore]] vehemently opposed Gandhi's stance, maintaining that an earthquake can only be caused by natural forces, not moral reasons, however repugnant the practice of untouchability may be.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Gandhi statue, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Statue of Mahatma Gandhi in [[Tavistock Square]] Gardens, London.]]

Gandhi's birthday, October 2, is a national holiday in India, [[Gandhi Jayanti]]. 

The word ''[[Mahatma]]'', while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''maha'' meaning ''Great'' and ''atma'' meaning ''Soul''. It is similar to the British [[honorifics]] like [[Your Excellency]] or [[Sir]]. But, unlike these that are officially conferred, the reference to Gandhi is an unofficial title that Indians use as though it were an official one. 

Most sources, such as Dutta and Robinson's ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', state that [[Rabindranath Tagore]] first accorded the title of ''Mahatma'' to Gandhi.<ref> Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2.</ref> Other sources state that [[Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta]] accorded him this title on [[January 21]], [[1915]].<ref>http://kamdartree.com/mahatma_kamdar.htm).</ref> In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never felt worthy of the honour.<ref>[http://kamdartree.com/Dr%20PJ%20Mehta.htm M.K.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named Gandhi the [[Man of the Year]] in 1930, the runner-up to [[Albert Einstein]] as [[Person of the Year|"Person of the Century"]] at the end of 1999, and named [[Tenzin Gyatso|The Dalai Lama]], [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]], [[Martin luther king|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[Nelson Mandela]] as ''Children of Gandhi'' and his spiritual heirs to non-violence. The [[Government of India]] awards the annual [[Mahatma Gandhi Peace Prize]] to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens. [[Nelson Mandela]], the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, is a prominent non-Indian recipient. 

In 1996, the Government of India introduced the Mahatma Gandhi series of currency notes in [[Indian Rupee|rupee]]s 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 denomination. Today, all the currency notes in circulation in India contain a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1969, the United Kingdom issued a series of stamps commemorating the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi.
[[Image:PMBGandhistatue.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The centennial commemorative statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the center of downtown [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[South Africa]].]] 

In the United Kingdom, there are several prominent statues of Gandhi, most notably in [[Tavistock Square]], [[London]] near [[University College London]] where he studied law. [[January 30]] is commemorated in the [[United Kingdom]] as the "National Gandhi Remembrance Day." In the [[United States]], there are statues of Gandhi outside the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] Park in [[New York City]] and the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], and in Waikiki, Hawaii. The city of [[Pietermaritzburg]], [[South Africa]] <U+2014>  where Gandhi was ejected from a first-class train in 1893 <U+2014> now hosts a commemorative statue. There are wax statues of Gandhi at the [[Madame Tussauds|Madame Tussaud's]] wax museums in [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], and other cities around the world.

Gandhi never received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], though he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the [[American Friends Service Committee]].<ref>[http://www.afsc.org/about/nobel/past-nominations.htm AFSC's Past Nobel Nominations].</ref> Decades later, the Nobel Committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award. Mahatma Gandhi was to receive the Prize in [[1948]], but his assassination prevented the award from being awarded to him. The war breaking out between the newly created states of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] could have been an additional complicating factor that year.<ref>Amit Baruah. [http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/17/stories/2006101704971200.htm  `Gandhi not getting the Nobel was the biggest omission']. [[The Hindu]], 2006.

==Gandhi in film, literature, plays, and popular culture==
:{{main|List of artistic depictions of Mahatma Gandhi}}

There have been numerous films and a few stage productions about (or including) Gandhi. Of these, perhaps the most well known are the [[1982]] [[Academy Award]]-winning film, ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', the [[2006]] [[Bollywood]] [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare Award]]-winning film, ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'', and the play ''[http://www.ferozkhan.com/fz_mahatmasynopsis.htm Mahatma vs. Gandhi]'' (which will be released as the upcoming film, ''[[Gandhi, My Father]]''. [http://imdb.com/title/tt0459293]).

==Criticism and controversies==
As a rule, Gandhi was opposed to the concept of [[Partition (law)|partition]] as it contradicted his vision of religious unity. <ref> reprinted in ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-0765531-0420058#reader-link The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas].'', Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) pp. 106-108.</ref> He wrote in ''Harijan'' on [[06 October]], [[1946]]: 

:[The demand for Pakistan] as put forth by the Moslem League is un-Islamic and I have not hesitated to call it sinful. Islam stands for unity and the brotherhood of mankind, not for disrupting the oneness of the human family. Therefore, those who want to divide India into possibly warring groups are enemies alike of India and Islam. They may cut me into pieces but they cannot make me subscribe to something which I consider to be wrong [...] we must not cease to aspire, in spite of [the] wild talk, to befriend all Moslems and hold them fast as prisoners of our love. <ref> reprinted in ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-0765531-0420058#reader-link The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas].''Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) pp. 308-9.</ref> 

However, as Homer Jack notes of Gandhi's long correspondence with [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] on the topic of Pakistan: "Although Gandhi was personally opposed to the [[Partition_of_India#Background_of_the_partition|partition of India]], he proposed an agreement [...] which provided that the Congress and the Moslem League would cooperate to attain independence under a provisional government, after which the question of partition would be decided by a plebiscite in the districts having a Moslem majority." <ref>Jack, Homer. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XpWO-GoOhVEC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR11&dq=The+Gandhi+Reader:+A+Sourcebook+of+His+Life+and+Writings&sig=mu7B1to2ve7qqIYNmXQMd5jifsY The Gandhi Reader]'', p. 418.</ref> 

These dual positions on the topic of the partition of India opened Gandhi up to criticism from both Hindus and Muslims. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and contemporary Pakistanis condemned Gandhi for undermining Muslim political rights. [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] and his allies condemned Gandhi, accusing him of politically appeasing Muslims while turning a blind eye to their atrocities against Hindus, and for allowing the creation of Pakistan (despite having publicly declared that "before partitioning India, my body will have to be cut into two pieces"<ref>"The life and death of Mahatma Gandhi", on BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/50664.stm], see section "Independence and partition."</ref>).  In contemporary times, Marxist academicians like [[Ayesha Jalal]] blame Gandhi and the Congress for being unwilling to share power with Muslims and thus hastening partition. Hindu political activists like [[Pravin Togadia]] and [[Narendra Modi]] have also criticized Gandhi's leadership and actions on this topic. Gandhi also came under some political fire for his criticism of those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means. His refusal to protest against the hanging of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]], [[Udham Singh]] and [[Rajguru]] were sources of condemnation among some parties.<ref>[http://www.kamat.com/mmgandhi/onbhagatsingh.htm Mahatama Gandhi on Bhagat Singh].</ref><ref>[http://india_resource.tripod.com/gandhi.html Gandhi - 'Mahatma' or Flawed Genius?].</ref>  Economists, such as [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], have [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-150092,curpg-2.cms criticized] Gandhi's ideas of [[swadeshi]].

Of this criticism, Gandhi stated, "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms [...] but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the [Hindu-Moslem riots] and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense."<ref> reprinted in ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-0765531-0420058#reader-link The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas].'', Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.</ref> 

Gandhi also expressed his dislike for [[Partition#Political_geography|partition]] during the late [[1930s]] in response to the topic of the [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition of Palestine to create Israel]]. He stated in ''Harijan'' on [[26 October]], [[1938]]:

:Several letters have been received by me asking me to declare my views about the Arab-Jew question in Palestine and [[History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany#Jews_under_the_Nazis_.281930s-1940.29|persecution of the Jews in Germany]]. It is not without hesitation that I venture to offer my views on this very difficult question. My sympathies are all with the Jews. I have known them intimately in South Africa. Some of them became life-long companions. Through these friends I came to learn much of their age-long persecution. They have been the untouchables of Christianity [...] But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice. The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine. Why should they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood? Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.<ref> reprinted in ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-0765531-0420058#reader-link The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas].'', Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) pp. 286-288.</ref>, <ref>http://lists.ifas.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0109&L=sanet-mg&P=31587.</ref>

He continued this argument in a number of articles reprinted in Homer Jack's ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XpWO-GoOhVEC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR11&dq=The+Gandhi+Reader:+A+Sourcebook+of+His+Life+and+Writings&sig=mu7B1to2ve7qqIYNmXQMd5jifsY The Gandhi Reader: A Sourcebook of His Life and Writings].'' In the first, "Zionism and Anti-Semitism," written in [[1938]] (prior to the revelations of the nature of the Holocaust after the end of [[World War II]]), Gandhi commented upon the [[1930s]] [[History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany#Jews_under_the_Nazis_.281930s-1940.29|persecution of the Jews in Germany]] within the context of [[Satyagraha]]. He offered non-violence as a method of combating the difficulties Jews faced in Germany, stating,

:If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment. And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance, but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example. If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered, he or they cannot be worse off than now. And suffering voluntarily undergone will bring them an inner strength and joy [...] the calculated violence of Hitler may even result in a general massacre of the Jews by way of his first answer to the declaration of such hostilities. But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering, even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant. For to the God-fearing, death has no terror.<ref>Jack, Homer. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=XpWO-GoOhVEC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR11&dq=The+Gandhi+Reader:+A+Sourcebook+of+His+Life+and+Writings&sig=mu7B1to2ve7qqIYNmXQMd5jifsY The Gandhi Reader]'', pp. 319-20.</ref> 

Gandhi was highly criticized for these statements and responded in the article "Questions on the Jews" with "Friends have sent me two newspaper cuttings criticizing my appeal to the Jews. The two critics suggest that in presenting non-violence to the Jews as a remedy against the wrong done to them, I have suggested nothing new....what I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation.
<ref> Jack, Homer. ''The Gandhi Reader'', p. 322.</ref> He responded to the criticisms in "Reply to Jewish Friends"<ref> Jack, Homer. ''The Gandhi Reader'', pp. 323-4.</ref> and "Jews and Palestine."<ref> Jack, Homer ''The Gandhi Reader'', pp. 324-6.</ref> by arguing that "What I have pleaded for is renunciation of violence of the heart and consequent active exercise of the force generated by the great renunciation." <ref> Jack, Homer. ''The Gandhi Reader'', p. 322.</ref>

[[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]] leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]] condemned Gandhi's using the term ''Harijans'' to refer to the [[Dalit]] community. This term meant "Children of God";<ref>http://www.britishempire.co.uk/glossary/h.htm.</ref> it was interpreted by some as saying that Dalits were socially immature, and that privileged caste Indians played a paternalistic role. Ambedkar and his allies also felt Gandhi was undermining Dalit political rights. Gandhi, although born into the vaishya caste, insisted that he was able to speak on behalf of Dalits, despite the availability of Dalit activists such as Ambedkar. 

[[Indologist]] [[Koenraad Elst]] also critiqued Gandhi. He questioned the effectiveness of Gandhi's theory of non-violence and argued that it achieved only a few token concessions from the British. Elst also argued that it was British fear of violence (along with depletion due to the after effects of [[World War II]]) rather than non-violence, that led to [[Indian independence movement|Indian Independence]]. According to Elst, this was exemplified by Indian public support for [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]'s [[Indian National Army]].<ref>[http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/articles/fascism/gandhimistake.html Elst, Koenraad. Learning from Mahatma Gandhi<U+2019>s mistakes.]</ref> As praise, "Gandhi's major claim to fame was that he, almost alone among the freedom leaders in the entire colonized world, had sought and developed policies and strategies rooted in native culture rather than borrowed from Western models (nationalism, socialism etc.)<U+2014>"<ref>[http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/fascism/2murders.html Elst, Koenraad. A Tale of Two Murders : Yitzhak Rabin and Mahatma Gandhi.]</ref>

Some have interpreted statements made by Gandhi as offensive to [[Black people|Black]] [[South Africa]]ns, particularly, his use of the word "[[kaffir]]," which today is considered a derogatory term.<ref>http://www.trinicenter.com/WorldNews/ghandi4.htm.</ref> It is worth noting, however, that during Gandhi's time, it had [[Kaffir (Historical usage in southern Africa)|a different connotation]] than [[Kaffir (ethnic slur)|its present-day usage]]. Former [[President of South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] is an advocate of Gandhi, despite efforts in [[2003]] on the part of Gandhi's critics to prevent the unveiling of a statue of Gandhi in [[Johannesburg]].<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1064687,00.html#article_continue.</ref>
Indeed, Mandela recently took part in the [[29 January]] - [[30 January]] [[2007]] conference in [[New Delhi]] which marked the 100th anniversary of Gandhi's introduction of [[satyagraha]] in [[South Africa]]. <ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/01/29/mandela_calls_for_gandhis_non_violence_approach/ Boston news article].</ref>
