'''University Hall''' is the seat of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] administration. Located at 601 S. Morgan Street, it is 103 m tall, making it the tallest building on Chicago's West Side. An unusual feature of its design is that instead of [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] it actually widens in two stages, so that it is six meters wider at the top floor than at its base. 

== History ==
It was designed in the [[Brutalist]] style with the rest of Circle Campus by [[Walter Netsch]], and built by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]. The offices of the university chancellor are located on the top floor.
