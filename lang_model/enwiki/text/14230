The '''2009 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Tournament''' was held from May 9 through May 25, 2009. This was the 39th annual Division I [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship]] tournament. Sixteen NCAA Division I college men's [[college lacrosse|lacrosse]] teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament, to play in the NCAA Tournament.

The first round of the tournament was played on May 9th and 10th at the home fields of the seeded teams. The quarterfinals were held on May 16 and 17th on neutral site fields at [[Hofstra University]] ([[James M. Shuart Stadium]]) and the [[United States Naval Academy]] ([[Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]]). The tournament culminated with the semifinals and final held on [[Memorial Day]] weekend at [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=3202922&campaign=rss&source=NCAAHeadlines 2009 lacrosse finals to be played at Gillette Stadium], [[ESPN]], January 18, 2008.</ref>  The tournament was won by [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|Syracuse University]] who defeated [[Cornell University]], 10<U+2013>9, in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] in front of 41,935 fans.<ref>[http://suathletics.com/sports/2009/5/25/MLAX_0525092654.aspx?id=6546 Syracuse 10, Cornell 9 (OT)], [[Syracuse University]], May 25, 2009.

The NCAA Division I Men<U+2019>s Lacrosse Committee selected the participating teams for the championship tournament. The committee announced the qualifying teams and the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeding]] order on Sunday, May 3, 2009. Seven [[College lacrosse#NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse|conferences]] received automatic bids for their top team.

The tournament began on Saturday, May 9, when the [[Brown Bears|Brown Bears]] traveled to face the eighth-seeded [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins Blue Jays]] at [[Homewood Field]] in [[Baltimore]]. The Blue Jays pulled away to three-goal leads in the first and final quarters, but the Bears equalized both times. In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown [[field lacrosse#Attackmen|attackman]] Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11<U+2013>11. In [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], Hopkins won the [[faceoff#Other sports|faceoff]] and called a timeout, before Brian Christopher drove up the right side of the field and made a game-winning top-corner shot on the run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.<ref>[http://blogs.insidelacrosse.com/2009/05/09/warrior-may-madness-in-game-blog-brown-at-no-2-johns-hopkins/ Warrior May Madness: In-Game Blog - Brown at No. 8 Johns Hopkins], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 9, 2009.

[[UMBC Retrievers|UMBC]] then played at number-six seed [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]]. The UMBC Retrievers possessed the most efficient [[field lacrosse#Penalties|extra-man offense]] (EMO) and the best-rated [[field lacrosse#Midfielders|midfield]] in the nation.

At halftime, the Retrievers led the Tar Heels, 8<U+2013>6. The lead changed hands several times in the third period, before North Carolina took control for the remainder of the game to win, 15<U+2013>13.

The final game was also held at Gillette Stadium and took place on [[Memorial Day]], May 25. Cornell controlled the tempo of the game for the first 56 minutes and frustrated Syracuse with a tough defense. Late in the fourth quarter, the Big Red led, 9<U+2013>6, before Syracuse's Stephen Keogh and Cody Jamieson narrowed the deficit to one goal with 2:46 remaining. Keogh attempted another shot but missed, and Cornell took possession with 27.6&nbsp;seconds left to play. The Orange's Kenny Nims then dislodged the ball from Matt Moyer, and Keogh recovered possession. He took a wild shot, which was caught by Syracuse's Matt Abbott. As he was flattened by Cornell defenders, Abbott got off a pass to Nims, who had run from midfield to the very edge of the crease. Nims connected with his shot on goal to send the game into overtime.<ref name=storybook>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/columns/story?columnist=oneil_dana&page=lacrosse_final0525 Syracuse title has storybook ending], ESPN, May 25, 2009.</ref> Cornell won the overtime faceoff, but Syracuse defenseman Sid Smith stripped Ryan Hurley to create a turnover.
