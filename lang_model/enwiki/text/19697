'''''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang''''' ([[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Bunga Roos dari Cikembang''''', translated to English as '''''The Rose of Cikembang''''') is a 1927 [[Malay trade and creole languages|Malay language]] novel written by [[Kwee Tek Hoay]]. Inspired by the lyrics to the French song "Mimi d'Amour" and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', the novel was initially written as an outline for the stage drama troupe Union Dalia. The seventeen-chapter book follows a plantation manager named Aij Tjeng who must leave his beloved ''njai'' ([[concubine]]) Marsiti so that he can be married. Eighteen years later, after his daughter Lily dies, his would-be son-in-law Bian Koen discovers that Marsiti had a daughter, Roosminah, who greatly resembles Lily. Bian Koen and Roosminah are married.

Interpreted variously as a call for education and a treatise on the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[reincarnation]], ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was initially published as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in Kwee's magazine ''Panorama''; it soon proved among his most popular works. By 1930 there had been a number of unapproved stage adaptations, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his [[copyright]]. The work was filmed twice, first [[Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (1931 film)|in 1931]] by [[The Teng Chun]] then in 1975 by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]]. It ranks amongst the most reprinted works of [[Chinese Malay literature]] and has been translated to Dutch and English.

==Plot==
Oh Aij Tjeng is a young [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] man who runs a plantation in [[West Java]]. He lives there with his ''njai'' ([[concubine]]), a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] woman named Marsiti. The two are deeply in love and promise to be faithful forever. However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng that he has been [[betrothed]] to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, he disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished. He falls in love with her and begins forgetting Marsiti.

Not long afterwards Keng Djim calls Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio to his deathbed, where he confesses that he has recently learned that Marsiti was his daughter from a [[native Indonesians|native]] ''njai'' he had taken as a youth, and that Marsiti had recently died. As such, he greatly regrets that he and Pin Loh had her chased away from the plantation. Keng Djim hints that there is another secret to be shared, but dies before he can reveal it. Aij Tjeng calls for his father, to discover the secret, but finds that he too has died.

Eighteen years later, Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have a daughter named Lily, who is betrothed to a rich Chinese youth named Sim Bian Koen. Lily, although beautiful and talented, is obsessed with death and sadness; she firmly believes that she is destined to die young. She eventually tells Bian Koen to find another fianc<U+00E9>e as she will soon leave him. She falls ill shortly thereafter, and doctors are unable to save her. This drives Bian Koen to consider suicide and deals a psychological shock to Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio.

By the following year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends to go to war in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds an extremely well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.

When he wakes up at his home, Bian Koen tells his parents that he saw Lily in Cikembang. After investigating, the Sims discover that "Lily" is in fact Aij Tjeng's daughter with Marsiti, Roosminah, who was raised in secret by Tirta; because of her beauty, equal to that of Lily in every way, she is known as "The Rose of Cikembang". The Sims are able to contact Aij Tjeng, and after discovering Roosminah's background they have Roosminah take over Lily's identity. Her extravagant wedding with Bian Koen is attended by thousands, including Marsiti's spirit.

==Writing==
''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was written by the ethnic Chinese journalist [[Kwee Tek Hoay]]. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his native wife,{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}} Kwee had been raised in [[Chinese culture]] and schools. By the time he wrote the novel, Kwee was an active proponent of [[Buddhist]] theology. However, he also wrote extensively on themes relating to native Indonesians{{sfn|JCG, Kwee Tek Hoay}} and was a keen social observer.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, Chinese-Indonesian writers}} Kwee read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay; he drew on these readings after becoming a writer.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}}

Kwee wrote that he was inspired to write the novel after hearing his daughter singing an English version of the French song "Mimi d'Amour". He was struck by the melancholic lyrics and decided to write a "sad story or stage play"{{efn|Original: "''... satoe tjerita atawa lelakon komedie jang sedih.''"}} based on it. However, he did not begin the writing process until February 1927, when the Union Dalia Opera requested permission to perform his earlier work ''[[Allah jang Palsoe]]'' (''A False God''; 1919). As he considered the work too difficult for the native troupe, he began writing an original outline for their performance, based on his musings. Union Dalia performed ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' on 5 March 1927, based on the outline Kwee had written; the novel was not completed until 20 April.{{sfn|Kwee|2001|pp=298<U+2013>299}} Scholar of Chinese-Indonesian literature Myra Sidharta suggests the ultimate result was inspired by [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}}

''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' is divided into seventeen chapters and is less than 120 pages in length (108 in the second printing).{{sfn|Kwee|1930|pp=100, 108}} As such, it is considerably shorter than some of Kwee's other works. ''Drama dari Merapi'' (''Drama from Merapi'') was 620 pages long, while ''Drama di Boven Digoel'' (''Drama from Boven Digoel''), his longest, was 718 pages.{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}}

==Themes==
In his foreword, Kwee wrote that ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was intended to lead readers to consider how fate is often at odds with the wants of those involved.{{sfn|Kwee|2001|p=300}} Critical readings have, however, been diverse. Faruk, a professor of literature at [[Gadjah Mada University]], reads the novel as related to the Buddhist concept of [[reincarnation]], noting the repeated emphasis on the parallels, both physical and psychological, between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.{{sfn|Faruk|2007|pp=264<U+2013>266}}

Sidharta suggests that ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was written as an argument that the [[illegitimate children]] of ''njai''s would be able to develop as any other person, given the proper education.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} Translator Maya Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the ''njai'' within the story. She considers it an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines. She finds that the need for education (including an understanding of music) is a subtext found in the novel. However, unlike Sidharta she considers this message directed not only at the children of ''njai''s, but women in general.{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=271}} Only through receiving an education and following Chinese and European [[etiquette]] can a woman be considered truly "modern".{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=273}}

Sidharta notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} Sutedja-Liem, in a similar vein, emphasises the mystical powers which Marsiti seems to possess. She writes that this abandonment of [[realism (arts)|realism]] rendered the book, with its "modern" message, "anti-modern".{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=269}}

==Release and reception==
[[File:Dardanella advertisement, Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang.jpg|thumb|alt=Newspaper advertisement|An advertisement for a performance of ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' in [[Medan]] by [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]], 1930]]
''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was originally published in 1927, as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in Kwee's magazine ''Panorama''. It was compiled as a book later that year and published by Panorama Publishers&nbsp;<U+2013> also run by Kwee. This printing sold out.{{sfn|Kwee|1930|p=IV}} However, Kwee suggested that "writing Malay novels&nbsp;... was not enough to live on".{{efn|Original: "''... pakerdjaan mengarang tjerita Melajoe&nbsp;... tida membri hatsil jang bole dipake idoep.''"}}{{sfn|Kwee|1930|p=II}} The book has since proved to be one of Kwee's most popular novels, and is one of the most commonly reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature.{{sfn|Sidharta|2001|pp=xx<U+2013>xxi}} It saw its second printing in 1930, again published by Panorama{{sfn|Kwee|1930|p=V}} with a third printing by Swastika in 1963.{{sfn|WorldCat entry (3rd printing)}} Sidharta records a fourth printing in 1972, although she does not note a publisher.{{sfn|Sidharta|1996|pp=333<U+2013>334}} A new printing, adapting the [[EYD|1972 spelling reform]], was included in the second volume of ''Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia'', an anthology of Chinese Malay literature.{{sfn|Kwee|2001|p=297}} It has also seen several translations. In 2007 ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' was translated to Dutch as ''De roos uit Tjikembang'' by Sutedja-Liem; this edition was published by [[Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies|KITLV Press]].{{sfn|Sutedja-Liem|2007|p=269}} In 2013 the [[Lontar Foundation]] published an English-language translation by George A. Fowler under the title ''The Rose of Cikembang''.{{sfn|WorldCat entry (English edition)}}

Stage performances and adaptations of ''Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang'' began before the novel was completed, beginning with the Union Dalia performance in 1927.{{sfn|Kwee|2001|pp=298<U+2013>299}} By 1930 numerous native and ethnic-Chinese troupes had performed the story. Kwee wrote that these stage performances were sometimes credited for the novel's success, but discounted the idea, writing that the two mediums were different and, in adaptations, changes were necessary. He noted the tendency of native troupes to emphasise Marsiti's role as one such change{{sfn|Kwee|1930|p=II}} and considered most such adaptations&nbsp;<U+2013> excepting those performed by [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]]&nbsp;<U+2013> to be of poor quality; he wrote that they generally did not pay him for the right to use the story. In the 1930 edition Kwee asked readers to inform ''Panorama'' of any illegal performances, to help him enforce his copyright.{{sfn|Kwee|1930|p=III}} Stage performances have continued into the 2000s.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, Chinese-Indonesian writers}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2012, Remembering}}

The novel has twice been adapted for film. The first adaptation, [[Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (1931 film)|released in 1931]], was directed by [[The Teng Chun]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Boenga Roos}} The sinologist [[Leo Suryadinata]] gives the film as the first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] [[sound film]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]],{{sfn|Suryadinata|1995|p=43}} although [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggests there was [[Karnadi Anemer Bangkong|another domestic talkie]] released in 1930.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=137}} In 1975 an adaptation was made by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]] under the title ''Bunga Roos dari Cikembang'', following the Perfected Spelling System. Although the main points of the story remained the same, several of the Chinese names were Indonesianised. Oh Ay Cheng, for example, was renamed Wiranta, while Gwat Nio was changed to Salmah.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Bunga Roos}}
