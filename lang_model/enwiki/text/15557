The '''US Aviation Cumulus''' is an [[United States|American]] [[low-wing]], single-seat, open cockpit [[motor glider]] that was designed by [[US Aviation]] and supplied in [[Homebuilt aircraft|kit form]] for amateur construction.<ref name="WDLA04">Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04'', page 59.

==Design and development==
The Cumulus was conceived as a lightweight motorglider for soaring and also for touring. The aircraft production was outsourced, initially produced by [[AeroDreams]] it was later produced by [[Dave Ekstrom]] for US Aviation after 2004. The Cumulus first flew in 1995 and was named after the [[cumulus cloud]] type.<ref name="WDLA04" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" />

Built from steel tubing, composites and [[Aircraft fabric covering|fabric]], the Cumulus is powered by a standard [[Rotax 447]] {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine in [[pusher configuration]], although engines from {{convert|20|to|55|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} can be fitted. The wings are detachable for transport or storage. It has a glide ratio of 20:1. The [[landing gear]] is [[Conventional landing gear|conventional]] and the [[cruciform tail]] is [[strut-braced]].<ref name="WDLA04" /><ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="KitplanesDec2007" /><ref name="KitplanesDec1998" />

Construction time from the kit is estimated at 200 hours.<ref name="KitplanesDec2007" />
