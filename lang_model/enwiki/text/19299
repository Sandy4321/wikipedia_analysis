The tornado touched down west-southwest of [[West Hattiesburg, Mississippi|West Hattiesburg]] at 5:03 p.m. [[Central Standard Time|CST]] (2303 UTC) and moved through northeast Lamar County, where [[Oak Grove High School (Hattiesburg, Mississippi)|Oak Grove High School]], its baseball fields, and a housing area near the school sustained the most intense damage, with one well-built brick home being leveled and the school sustaining substantial roof damage. Several buildings around the athletic stadiums at the school were destroyed and several steel lights with concrete reinforcement were snapped. Vehicles were thrown considerable distances, one of which was taken from a parking lot at the high school, rolled up a hill and across the field, and then deposited onto the pitcher's mound. Just before crossing [[Interstate 59]], it caused significant roof damage to an apartment complex. It then moved into Forrest County and the northwest side of Hattiesburg.
