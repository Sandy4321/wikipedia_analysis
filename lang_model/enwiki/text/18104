'''Strangford Lough''' or '''Strangford Loch''' ({{lang-ga|Loch Cuan}}) is a large sea [[loch]] or [[inlet]] in [[County Down]], in the east of [[Northern Ireland]]. It is the largest inlet in the [[British Isles]], covering 150&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. The loch is almost totally enclosed by the [[Ards Peninsula]] and is linked to the [[Irish Sea]] by a long narrow channel or strait. The main body of the loch has at least seventy islands along with many islets (pladdies), bays, coves, headlands and mudflats. It is a [[conservation area]] and its abundant wildlife is recognised internationally for its importance.

Strangford Lough is a popular tourist destination noted for its fishing and scenery. Towns and villages around the loch include [[Killyleagh]], [[Comber]], [[Newtownards]], [[Portaferry]] and [[Strangford]]. The latter two are connected by a [[RORO|car ferry]].

==Name==
The name ''Strangford'' comes {{etymology|non|Strangr-fj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r|strong sea-inlet}}.<ref name=pni>[http://www.placenamesni.org/resultdetails.php?entry=12279 PlaceNames NI: Strangford Lough]</ref> The [[Vikings]] were active in the area during the Middle Ages. Originally, this name referred only to the narrow channel linking the loch to the sea (between the villages of [[Strangford]] and [[Portaferry]]).<ref name=pni/> Up until about the 18th century, the main body of the loch was better known by the (older) [[Irish language|Irish]] name ''Loch Cuan'', meaning "loch of the bays/havens".<ref name=pni/> This name was anglicized as ''Lough Coan'', ''Lough Cone'', ''Lough Coyn'', ''Lough Coin'', or similar.<ref name=pni/>

The narrow channel may have been known in Latin as the ''fretum Brene''.<ref>II-Landing Places of St. Patrick, "Saint Patrick: his life and mission", Mrs. THOMAS qONCANNON, The Talbot Press Ltd., Dublin & Cork, From The James D. Phelan Celtic Collection</ref> In [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]] the loch's name is spelt ''Strangfurd'' or  ''Strang<U+FB01>rt Loch''.<ref>[http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/jordanscastleus.pdf Jordan's Castle (Ulster-Scots translation)] Department of the Environment.</ref><ref>[http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/nendrumus.pdf Nendrum (Ulster-Scots translation)] Department of the Environment.</ref>

[[Maerl]] is a calcareous deposit, in the main, of two species, of [[calcareous]] [[algae]] ''Phymatolithon calcareum'' and ''Lithothamnion glaciale'' which form free-living beds of unattached, branched [[coralline algae|corallines]], living or dead, in Strangford Lough.<ref>Blake,C. and Maggs, C.A. 2001.

MAGNI publication no. 008</ref>

The rocky and boulder shores toward the south of the lough are dominated by the seaweed knotted wrack ''Ascophyllum nodosum''. The usual zonation of weeds on these shore is, at the top channel wrack (''[[Pelvetia]] canaliculata'' (L.) Dcne. et Rhur.), followed by spiral wrack (''[[Fucus spiralis]]'' L.), then knotted wrack (''Ascophyllum nodosum'' (L.) Le Jol) with some admixture of bladder wrack (''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'' L.) and then serrated wrack (''[[Fucus serratus]]'' L.) before coming to the low water kelps.<ref>Brown, R. 1990.

A brown [[seaweed]] named ''[[Sargassum]] muticum'', originally from the [[Pacific]] ([[Japan]]) was discovered on 15 March 1995 in Strangford Lough at Paddy's Point. The plants were well established on mesh bags containing oysters. The bags had been put out in 1987 containing Pacific oysters (''Crassostrea gigas'') imported from [[Guernsey]]. This ''Sargassum'' is known to be a highly invasive species.<ref>Boaden, P.J.S. 1995. The adventive seaweed ''Sargassum muticum'' (Yendo) Fensholt in Strangford Lough, [[Northern Ireland]]. ''Ir.Nat.

===Fauna===
Strangford Lough is an important winter [[Bird migration|migration]] destination for many wading and sea [[birds]]. [[Animal]]s commonly found in the lough include [[common seal]]s, [[basking shark]]s and [[Brent Goose|Brent Geese]]. Three quarters of the world population of Pale Bellied Brent Geese spend winter in the lough area.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/handsonnature/waterways/strangford_loch.shtml BBC Hands on Nature]</ref>

The invasive carpet sea squirt, ''Didemnum vexillum'', was found in the Lough in 2012.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5ieCJtgjCvYON6mw6vdBsADnPP7HQ?docId=N0177811347635110834A Carpet sea squirt found in Lough]</ref>

==Tidal electricity==
[[File:SeaGen installed.jpg|thumb|right|[[SeaGen]].]]
In 2007 Strangford Lough became home to the world's first commercial [[Marine science|tidal stream]] power station, [[SeaGen]]. The 1.2 [[megawatt]] underwater tidal electricity generator, part of Northern Ireland's [[Environment and Renewable Energy Fund]] scheme, takes advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4 [[m/s]]. Although the generator is powerful enough to power up to a thousand homes, the [[turbine]] has a minimal [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]], as it is almost entirely submerged, and the rotors turn slowly enough that they pose no danger to [[wildlife]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article3694859.ece Turbine technology is turning the tides into power of the future]</ref><ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52536 SeaGen Turbine Installation Completed]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7790494.stm| title=Tidal energy system on full power| publisher=BBC News | accessdate=13 September 2009 | date=18 December 2008}}</ref>

Since June 2008 a [[tidal energy]] device called [[Evopod]] has been tested in Strangford Lough near the Portaferry Ferry landing.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oceanflowenergy.com/news-details.aspx?id=6| publisher=Ocean Flow Energy Ltd| title=First Testing of Evopod at Strangford Narrows| date=12 June 2008| accessdate=13 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The device is a 1/10 scale prototype and is being monitored by [[Queen's University Belfast]]. The device is a semi submerged floating tidal turbine and is moored to the seabed via a buoy mounted swivel so that it always maintains optimum heading into the direction of the tidal flow. The scale device is not grid connected and dissipates the small amount of power it generates as heat into the sea. Malik Priestley (executive creator of SeaGen) said "tidal power will provide sustainable amounts of green, renewable energy and pose no threats to surrounding wild life".

==Activity on Strangford Lough==
[[Image:Strangford (16), August 2009.JPG|thumb|right|Strangford Lough Canoe Trail, August 2009]]
Strangford Lough is a place of natural beauty that the locals put to great use. From using it as a national highway (Portaferry-Strangford ferry) to using it for activities of leisure - sailing, kayaking, bird watching, diving and much more. There are a number of companies based in the local area encouraging visitors to explore the area including: Exploris Aquarium - where you can learn more about the lough and its wildlife; Clearsky Adventure Centre - kayaking, canoeing etc. and DV diving. There are also canoe trails in place and a 'Strangford Lough Activity Map' has been launched as a part of a series of maps produced by the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland.

==Ferry==
[[Image:Strangford Ferry (10), August 2009.JPG|thumb|right|MV ''Portaferry II'', August 2009]]
There has been a ferry service between [[Portaferry]] and [[Strangford]], without a break, for almost four centuries.<ref name="ferry">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadsni.gov.uk/index/strangfordferry/strangfordferry-history.htm| title=Strangford Lough Ferry - History| publisher=Northern Ireland Roads Department| accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> The alternative road journey is 47 miles and takes about an hour and a half, while the ferry crosses the {{convert|0.6|nmi|mi}} in 8 minutes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadsni.gov.uk/index/strangfordferry/strangfordferry-about.htm| title=About the Ferry| publisher=Northern Ireland Roads Department| accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> The subsidised public service operates at a loss of more than <U+00A3>1m per year but is viewed as  an important transport link to the Ards Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.portaferry.info/public_html/strangford-ferry-operating-at-a-loss/| title=Strangford Ferry Operating at a loss| publisher=Portaferry Online| accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>

MV ''Portaferry'' (1) (ex-''Cleddau King'') was bought from a company in Wales in 1975 after completion of the [[Cleddau Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=586103| title=Cleddau King| publisher=Shipspotting| accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> She was modified by [[Harland and Wolff]] of Belfast<ref name="ferry"/> and operated until sold in May 2002.

MV ''Strangford'' was built by the Verolme Shipyard in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and launched on 6 September 1969.

{{MV|Portaferry II}}, a <U+00A3>2.7 million vessel built by [[Remontowa|Gda<U+0144>ska Stocznia Remontowa]] and [[McTay Marine]] of Merseyside, came into service on 18 December 2001, relegating MV&nbsp;''Strangford'' to a support role.<ref name="ferry"/>

==Archaeology==
Strangford Lough has a substantial archaeological heritage. Intertidal archaeological surveys in recent years have brought hundreds of sites to light, including [[fish trap]]s, [[Tide mill|tidal mills]], [[kelp]] walls and harbours and landing places.<ref>{{cite book | last=O'Sullivan, Aidan & Breen, Colin| year=2007 |title=Maritime Ireland.
