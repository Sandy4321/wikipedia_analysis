== History ==
Al Nassma Chocolate is the [[United Arab Emirates]]' first and only camel milk chocolate brand,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-firm-s-world-first-with-camel-milk-chocolate-84298.html#.VBVUiUv3TwJ|title=Dubai firm's world first with camel-milk chocolate|work=Arabian Business}}</ref> founded on October 22, 2008. The development and launch of the brand took almost four years.<ref>[http://ameinfo.com/blog/company-news/a/al-nassma-chocolate/al-nassma-chocolate-launches-firstretail-outlet-at-sharjah-international-airport/]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

== Products ==
The company's products include 70g camel milk chocolate bars in several flavours: whole milk, nuts and cocoa 70% (dark), Arabia (with a mix of Arabian spices such as [[cardamom]] and [[cinnamon]]), [[macadamia]] orange and dates; camel-shaped chocolates, Camel Caravan, with macadamia nut and honey cream filling; hollow camel figures; and various kinds of [[praline]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Publication: Gulf Africa Magazine|date=May 2013|pages=22&24}}</ref>

Arab cuisine traditionally includes camel milk in various forms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camelicious.ae/tradition.php|title=Emirates Industry|work=camelicious.ae}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Euronews|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGB024m-idM}}</ref> and was a staple of the diet of [[Bedouin]]s until mid-20th century. The company uses mild{{clarify|date=March 2015}} cocoa beans roasted in a manner that doesn<U+2019>t overpower the slight saltiness of camel milk.

Its 70g chocolate bars are wrapped in double printed gold foil; while pralines are packaged in boxes resembling camel hide. Wooden boxes sourced from Holzmanufaktur Liebich in Germany are used for Camel Caravan, and the camel figures are wrapped in golden foil, and packed in gift boxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liebich-holz.de/de/news/news/niederbayerisches-holz-im-orient.html|title=News Single|work=liebich-holz.de}}</ref>

== Production process ==
Al Nassma manufactures its own chocolates from cocoa beans. In 2006 the company set up a [[Halal]]-certified production facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theobroma-cacao.de/nc/en/choco-guide/choco-guide/alphabetical-list/company-details/schokolade/details/al-nassma-chocolate-llc/|title=Schokolade & Kakao: Al Nassma Chocolate LLC. - United Arab Emirates|work=theobroma-cacao.de}}</ref> The milk from which the chocolates are produced comes from camels at the Camelicious Farm in Umm Nahad, Dubai. The farm belongs to Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products (EICMP). The farm houses over 3,500 camels. The camels are milked twice daily, yielding around 5,000 litres of raw camel milk,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arabianindustry.com/hospitality/news/2013/jul/24/dubai-based-camel-milk-producer-plans-to-enter-european-market-4387214/#.VBV9eUv3TwI|title=Dubai-based camel milk producer plans to enter European market|work=ArabianIndustry.com}}</ref> which is [[pasteurised]] in an [[ISO 22000]] certified dairy plant.<ref>[http://us.industrysourcing.com/articles/257712.aspx]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> A portion of the milk is bottled for sale under the Camelicious label.
