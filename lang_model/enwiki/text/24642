'''M/S ''Fantaasia''''' is a car and passenger [[cruiseferry]] owned by the [[Estonia]]n [[ferry]] company [[Tallink]]. She is currently under charter to [[Algerie Ferries]], [[Algeria]]. She was built by [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4> Shipyards]], [[Turku]], [[Finland]] for [[SF Line]] for use in [[Viking Line]] traffic.

== History ==
===1979-1987===

The cheapest bid to build SF Line's new ferry was actually made by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]], but the Finnish Government subsidiarised W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4> so that they could eventually underbid Mitsubishi and hence get more jobs to Finland.<ref name="FoF">{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/turella_1979.htm Fakta om Fartyg: M/S ''Turella'' (1979)], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> The new ship's interior and exterior design was basically an extended version of [[M/S Aurella|M/S ''Aurella'']] from [[1973]].<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=5817.0 FCBS Forum: M/S Rosella/Turella verrattuna M/S Aurellaan], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> The ship, eventually named M/S ''Turella'', was delivered on [[4 July]] [[1979]], 11 days ahead of schedule. She was initially placed on Viking Line's [[Turku]]<U+2014>[[Mariehamn]]<U+2014>[[Stockholm]] service,<ref name="FoF" /> but when her sister [[M/S Rosella|M/S ''Rosella'']] was delivered the next year, Turella was moved to the less prestigious [[Naantali]]<U+2014>Mariehamn<U+2014>[[Kapellsk<U+00E4>r]] route.<ref name="FoF" /><ref name="Rosella">{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/rosella_1980.htm Fakta om Fartyg: M/S ''Rosella'' (1980)], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref>

===1988-1996===

In September [[1988]] SF Line took delivery of the new [[M/S Amorella|M/S ''Amorella'']], which replaced Rosella on the Turku<U+2014>Stockholm route. Originally SF Line had agreed to sell the ''Rosella'' to [[Stena Line]] upon delivery of the new ship. However due to the Amorella being delivered seven months behind schedule the ''Rosella'' could not be delivered to Stena when originally agreed. In the end the ''Turella'' was sold instead of ''Rosella,'' as it was generally in a better condition and easier to convert for the traffic Stena planned her for.<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=9391.msg42169#msg42169 FCBS Forum: Sliten konkurssin syyt ja seuraukset + muuta 1980-90-l. taitteen Vikingist<U+00E4>], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> After rebuilding at [[Cityvarvet]], [[Gothenburg]], the Turella re-emerged as M/S ''Stena Nordica'' (a name carried by many Stena Line ships over the years). ''Stena Nordica'' was placed a route connecting Gothenburg to [[Fredrikshavn]] in [[Denmark]] and [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] in [[Norway]]. She also occasionally served on the Gotheburg<U+2014>[[Kiel]] route when the ships normally sailing that route were docked. In [[1996]] ''Stena Nordica'' was rebuilt at [[<U+00D6>resundsvarvet]], [[Landskrona]], Sweden, transferred to the fleet of Stena's subsidiary [[Lion Ferry]] and renamed M/S ''Lion King''. During the next 1,5 years she sailed on routes [[Halmstad]] (Sweden) <U+2014> [[Gren<U+00E5>]] (Denmark) and [[Karlskona]] (Sweden) <U+2014> [[Gdynia]] ([[Poland]]).<ref name="FoF" />

===1996-2005===

In the end of the year [[1997]] ''Lion King'' was sold to [[Tallink]], who renamed her M/S ''Fantaasia'' and placed her on the [[Helsinki]]<U+2014>[[Tallinn]] route (where she served alongside her old Viking Line fleetmate [[M/S Meloodia|M/S ''Meloodia'']]).<ref name="FoF" /> In [[2002]] after the delivery of the new [[M/S Romantika|M/S ''Romantika'']], the ''Fantaasia'' was moved to the Tallinn<U+2014>Stockholm route, where she sailed alongside another old fleetmate from the Viking Line days, [[M/S Regina Baltica|M/S ''Regina Baltica'']].<ref name="FoF" /><ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/romantika_2002.htm Fakta om Fartyg: M/S ''Romantika'' (2002)], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref><ref name="VS">{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/viking_song_1980.htm Fakta om Fartyg: M/S ''Viking Song'' (1980)], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> In [[2004]] the new [[M/S Victoria I|M/S ''Victoria I'']] replaced Fantaasia on the Tallinn<U+2014>Stockholm route,<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/victoria_2004.htm Fakta om Fartyg: M/S ''Victoria'' (2004)], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> and from the start of April of the same year ''Fantaasia'' opened a new Helsinki<U+2014>Tallinn<U+2014>[[St. Petersburg]] route for Tallink.<ref name="FoF" /> Due to a rise in port fees issued by the Russian government and due to visa regulations not being prognosed to get any better between Russia and the [[European Union]] as it had been presumed when the line was started, the line was terminated by Tallink on [[January 2]], [[2005]].<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=7257.msg44359#msg44359 Tallink press release reprinted at the FCBS Forum], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> 

===2005-present===

Following the collapse of the St. Petersburg traffic, the ''Fantaasia'' was swiftly chartered to [[Algerie Ferries]] for duration of nine months, during which she sailed between [[France]] and [[Algeria]]. After the end of the charter she spent some five months laid up in Tallinn until she was placed on Tallink's new [[Riga]]<U+2014>Stockholm route in April [[2006]].<ref name="FoF" /> However after little over a month of traffic she was replaced by the larger ''Regina Baltica'',<ref name="FoF" /><ref name="VS" /> and subsequently chartered to [[COMANAV]] until April [[2007]]. Following the end of charter to COMANAV, she was again chartered to Algerie Ferries until October 2007.<ref name="FoF" /> Following the second Algerie Ferries charter she was chartered to the [[Norway]]-based [[Kystlink]]<ref>{{no icon}} [http://www.varden.no/article/20071010/NYHET/710100012/1088/_ Varden: Kystlink hyrer finsk ferje], retrieved 10. 10. 2007</ref> for three months (with an option for three additional months) from<ref name="FoF" /><ref>[http://www.baltic.omxgroup.com/market/?pg=details&instrument=EE3100004466&list=2&tab=news&news_id=218639 OMX Group: CORRECTION: Chartering Fantaasia], retrieved 19. 10. 2007</ref> to replace their [[M/S Pride of Telemark|M/S ''Pride of Telemark'']] that is being repaired following an accident where the ship rammed the breakwater at [[Hirtshals]], Denmark.<ref>[http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=11599.msg86293#msg86293 Aftenposten english article reprinted at the FCBS Forum], retrieved 18. 10. 2007</ref> Before entering service for Kystlink ''Fantaasia'' will be docked at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg.<ref>{{fi icon}} [http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=11787.msg88701#msg88701 FCBS Forum: Fantaasia vuokrataan Kystlinkille?], retrieved 18.  10. 2007</ref> On November 15 the Swedish Maritime Authority [[Sj<U+00F6>fartsinspektionen]] deemed the ship unsafe and prohibited it from leaving Cityvarvet until 18 faults found during the inspection were fixed.<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.gp.se/gp/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=361&a=383133 G<U+00F6>terborgs-Posten 17. 11. 2007: F<U+00E4>rja kvar i hamn med allvarliga fel], retrieved 17. 11. 2007</ref> Twelve of the faults were considered severe, and included several permanently open watertight doors, a nonfunctional loudspeaker system, blocked emergency exists and nonfunctional winches used for lowering lifeboats.<ref>{{sv icon}} [http://www.gt.se/nyheter/1.929930/personfarjan-panikstoppad GT.se 17. 11. 2007:  Personf<U+00E4>rjan panikstoppad], retrieved 17. 11. 2007</ref><ref>{{et icon}} [http://www.postimees.ee/171107/esileht/siseuudised/296181.php?tallinki-parvlaev-kuulutati-rootsis-soidukolbmatuks Postimees.ee 17. 11. 2007: Tallinki parvlaev kuulutati Rootsis s<U+00F5>iduk<U+00F5>lbmatuks], retrieved 17. 11. 2007</ref> According to Tallink, the inspection was made while refitting of the ship was still in process, which they cited as the reason why several onboard systems were turned off-line and normal safety procedures were not observed.<ref>{{et icon}} [http://www.postimees.ee/171107/esileht/siseuudised/296201.php?tallinki-ohutusjuht-fantaasia-oli-ulevaatuse-ajal-remondis Postimees.ee 17. 11. 2007: Tallinki ohutusjuht: Fantaasia oli <U+00FC>levaatuse ajal remondis], 18. 11. 2007</ref>
