==Current Faculty==
* '''President:''' Rev. Robert E. Hughes

== Student life ==

Paul VI is separated into four classes: Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors.  The school year begins in early September, and ends in the middle of June (Seniors graduate in May).  Extended periods of vacation are given in late November for Thanksgiving, late December for Christmas, and Middle April for Easter.  

The Paul VI school day starts at 8:05 AM, and ends at 2:30 PM.  Students are required to wear the designated school uniforms for the entirety of the day, except during casual days. Separate gym uniforms are required for Physical Education.  Discipline is organized into a system of demerits, whereby demerits are given out to students who break the school code of conduct as published annually in the student handbook.  The number of demerits given depends on the severity of the infraction.  Ten demerits result in a student receiving a detention.  As Paul VI is a Catholic high school, students are expected to comport themselves according to Catholic teaching.

The school day is organized into eight periods, each 43 minutes long.  Preceding 1st period is a homeroom period, where students receive news and announcements.  Occasionally, periods are shortened to allow for a student assembly or [[pep rally]], or for half days.  Throughout the school year, students will attend [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] on holidays or special occasions, either in [[Vincent Pallotti|St. Vincent Pallotti]] [[parish]] across the parking lot, or in the [[Auditorium]].  Usually, periods are shortened to accommodate these sessions.   

Students are required to take four years of [[math]], [[English studies|English]]/Literature, and [[Catholicism|religion]] in order to graduate.  Three years of [[science]] and [[history]] are also required, as are two years of a foreign language, and one year of writing, senior year health, and sophomore year physical/health education.

In certain cases, students may be able to shorten the number of years required for a certain subject or bypass these requirements entirely. In the mathematics program, if a Freshman takes up Honors Algebra II and trigonometry, continues with Pre-Calculus in their Sophomore year, and takes either AP Calculus AB/BC in Junior year, the student does not need to take a course in mathematics in their Senior year (as AP Calculus AB/BC is the highest math course offered). Students who take a course in practical, performing or fine arts for the four years spent at Paul Vi do not need to take courses in History. Should a student drop out of said art course, the given year's history course must be taken.
