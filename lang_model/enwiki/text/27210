'''Operation Burnt Frost''' was the code name given to the military operation to intercept and destroy a non-functioning U.S. [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO) satellite named [[USA-193]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2008/space-080226-afpn01.htm|title=Global Security}}</ref> The launch occurred on 20 February, 2008 at approximately 10:26 p.m. EST from the {{USS|Lake Erie|CG-70|6}}, which used a [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3|Standard Missile-3 (SM-3)]] to shoot down the satellite. Only a few minutes after launch, the SM-3 intercepted its target and successfully completed its mission, by neutralizing the potential dangers the rogue satellite originally imposed.<ref name=One>{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_one_time_mission.html|title=Aegis One Time Mission}}</ref> While the threat was mitigated, Operation Burnt Frost has received much scrutiny from other countries, mainly China and Russia.<ref name=arms>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/arms_race_in_space|title=Arms Race in Space}}</ref>

==NRO Satellite==
USA 193, also known as NRO launch 21 (NROL-21 or simply L-21), was an American military reconnaissance satellite launched on December 14, 2006. The USA-193 was owned by the NRO and its precise function and purpose are classified. However, several websites speculate that the satellite was probably a high resolution radar satellite intended to produce images for the NRO.<ref name=Decay>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/usa193.aspx|title=Decaying spy satellite}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.space.policy/2007-03/msg00261.html|title=USA-193: reboot problems}}</ref><ref name=NROL>{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/index_frame.htm?http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nrol-21.htm|title=NROL}}</ref> This argument is additionally supported by the fact that the satellite used a similar inclination to that of a Lacrosse Radar Satellite.<ref name="NROL">{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/index_frame.htm?http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nrol-21.htm|title=NROL}}</ref> Lacrosse is a terrestrial radar imaging reconnaissance satellite operated by the NRO.

The satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 1 p.m. PST aboard the Delta II space launch system.<ref name=Delta>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/news/newsitems/NROL-2112-14-06.html|title=Delta II Carries NRO Payload Into Space }}</ref> This marked the first launch conducted by the United Launch Alliance since it took over the program from Boeing Integrated Defense Systems on December 1, 2006.

While the launch was successful, ground controllers lost control over the USA-193 satellite shortly after it was established on its orbit, and were unable to regain control. The satellite itself posed minimal risk of falling and causing damage. However, the satellite carried hydrazine fuel which is very toxic.<ref name="Decay">{{cite web|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/usa193.aspx|title=Decaying spy satellite}}</ref> In 2008, President Bush, decided this risk would be too great and tasked United States Strategic Command to destroy the satellite to preserve human life.<ref name="One">{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_one_time_mission.html|title=Aegis One Time Mission}}</ref>

==Operation Burnt Frost Timeline==
[[File:SM-3 launch to destroy the NRO-L 21 satellite.jpg|thumb|Launch of the SM-3 missile that intercepted USA-193 on 20 February 2008]]

From inception to the successful interception of the satellite, the timeline spanned only a matter of months.<ref name=SpaceLaw>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/publications/USA-193|title=The National Center for Remote Sensing, Air, and Space Law}}</ref> However due to the complexity and coordination involved to the shoot down of USA-193, this timeline could be considered rather compressed.

While there was most likely early speculation about the USA-193<U+2019>s degrading orbit and the risks it might cause, established talks with military involvement began as early as December 2007.<ref name="SpaceLaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/publications/USA193|title=The National Center for Remote Sensing, Air, and Space Law}}</ref><ref name=NASA>{{cite web|url=http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/issues/31/31s_operation_burnt_frost.html|title=The Power of Social Networks}}</ref> However the birth of Operation Burnt Frost occurred on 4 January, 2008, when President Bush ordered that the threat of USA-193 be mitigated.<ref name="SpaceLaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/publications/USA193%20Selected%20Documents.pdf|title=www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/publications/USA193|title=The National Center for Remote Sensing, Air, and Space Law}}</ref><ref name=NASA>{{cite web|url=http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/issues/31/31s_operation_burnt_frost.html|title=The Power of Social Networks}}</ref> 

On 27 January, 2008 information about the orbital decay of USA-193 was given to the media.<ref name="SpaceLaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/publications/USA193|title=The National Center for Remote Sensing, Air, and Space Law}}</ref> Several of the initial reports projected that the satellite would return to earth sometime in late February, early March. Additionally, these reports suggested that likely no action would need to be taken as the satellite or any debris would have a small chance of hitting any inhabited area.<ref name=Threat>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22857051/|title=U.S. downplays threat from falling satellite}}</ref><ref name=powergone>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/us/27spy.html?_r=1&fta=y|title=U.S. Spy Satellite, Power Gone, May Hit Earth}}</ref> However, White House National Security Council spokesmen Gordon Johndroe, did mention that the U.S. government was monitoring the satellite<U+2019>s decay and that it was examining different options to <U+201C>mitigate any damage<U+201D>. Also, four anonymous U.S. Officials did report that the satellite, which never became operational, would have toxic rocket fuel (hydrazine fuel) that could pose a danger if the tank did not explode on re-entry.<ref name="Threat">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22857051/|title=U.S. downplays threat from falling satellite}}</ref>

On 14 February, 2008, General James Cartwright made a public announcement that the U.S. intended to shoot down USA-193. In this announcement he laid out several criteria into when, how and why the satellite would be shot down. The major objective was to reduce the risk to space, air and terrestrial platforms. He explained that they would wait for the shuttle to land, so the potential harm to the shuttle would not be a factor. Next they wanted to wait until the satellite was close to re-entry, this would limit the amount of space debris created. Finally, they did not want to let the satellite enter the earth<U+2019>s atmosphere because of its non-aerodynamic characteristics, which would make it extremely hard to intercept. He suggested that these criteria gave them an eight day window.<ref name=Video>{{cite web|url=http://videos.howstuffworks.com/science/operation-burnt-frost-videos-playlist.htm#video-33442|title=Operation Burnt Frost Videos}}</ref><ref name=VideoT>{{cite web|url=http://military.discovery.com/videos/satellite-shootdown-extras-general-cartwright-part-2.html|title=Satellite Shootdown Extras: General Cartwright Part 2}}</ref>

To meet the flexibility of this operation the government established that the U.S. Navy and the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) would be the best option. It had the ability to be a mobile asset and by utilizing the SM-3 it would have the ability to reach the necessary altitude.<ref name="Video">{{cite web|url=http://videos.howstuffworks.com/science/operation-burnt-frost-videos-playlist.htm#video-33442|title=Operation Burnt Frost Videos}}</ref> In addition the choice to use Aegis BMD was in large part to its successful track record in which it has successfully shot down 13 of 15 attempts at ballistic missiles.<ref name="One">{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_one_time_mission.html|title=Aegis One Time Mission}}</ref>

General Cartwright stated that if the satellite came down in one piece that nearly one half of the spacecraft would survive re-entry, which would spread the toxic cloud of hydrazine gas roughly over the size of two football fields.<ref name=errant>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/02/14/spy.satellite/index.html|title=Officials: U.S. to try to shoot down errant satellite}}</ref>
This potential risk seemed high enough to prompt the government and military to act as he stated <U+201C>the regret factor of acting clearly outweighed the regret factor of not acting".<ref name="Video">{{cite web|url=http://videos.howstuffworks.com/science/operation-burnt-frost-videos-playlist.htm#video-33442|title=Operation Burnt Frost Videos}}</ref>

Days prior to the launch the USS ''Lake Erie'' (primary) and {{USS|Decatur|DDG-73|6}} (backup) sailed several hundred miles northwest of Hawaii to her rendezvous point. The USS ''Lake Erie'' was chosen because she was the U.S. Navy<U+2019>s most experienced ballistic missile killer. The {{USS|Russell|DDG-59|6}} was also a backup but remained in port at Pearl Harbor.<ref name="One">{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_one_time_mission.html|title=Aegis One Time Mission}}</ref>

On 20 February, 2008, at 1:00 p.m. EST Secretary of Defense Gates, with consultation of the White House, approved the mission. The launch happened at 10:26 p.m. EST and the collision with the satellite happened a few minutes later.<ref name="One">{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_one_time_mission.html|title=Aegis One Time Mission}}</ref>

On 25 February, 2008, the Department of Defense announced that based on debris analysis, that the objective of destructing the hydrazine tank and reduction, if not elimination, of the risk to people on Earth was achieved.<ref name=Debris>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11709|title=Satellite Debris Analysis Indicates Hydrazine Tank Hit}}</ref>

This success was made through the coordination of over two dozen federal agencies. Indeed, the SM-3 traveled over 133&nbsp;nm to successfully intercept the USA-193 which was roughly the size of school bus.

==Aftermath==
There has been much criticism that has come from both Russia and China because of Operation Burnt Frost. The destruction of USA-193 came just weeks after Russia had drafted a new treaty to ban space weapons which was backed by China at a UN-sponsored forum. This treaty would ban the use of weapons against satellites or other spacecraft.<ref name=Russia>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13312|title=Russia proposes treaty to ban space weapons}}</ref> This prompted the Russians to accuse the United States of using the hydrazine gas as a cover-up to test an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. They claimed that several countries<U+2019> satellites that used toxic fuel have crashed into the Earth in the past but never warranted such <U+201C>extraordinary measures<U+201D>.<ref name=Spy>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7248995.stm|title=US spy satellite plan 'a cover' }}</ref> To further this notion, others have speculated that the toxic gas would have not survived re-entry anyway, or that the risk would be extremely small.<ref name="Spy">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7248995.stm|title=US spy satellite plan 'a cover'}}</ref><ref name=Experts>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/02/15/|title=Experts Scoff at Sat Shoot-Down Rationale}}</ref> These speculations have made many believe this was in response to [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|China<U+2019>s ASAT test]] on 11 January, 2007 and fear this would begin another <U+201C>space race<U+201D>.<ref name="arms">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/arms_race_in_space|title=Arms Race in Space}}</ref><ref name=Chinese>{{cite web|url=http://celestrak.com/events/asat.asp|title=Chinese ASAT Test}}</ref>

However, unnamed U.S. officials continue to deny that the satellite shoot down was in response to China<U+2019>s ASAT test one year prior, or that they are trying to protect classified information.<ref name=Pentagon>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1447206620080214?sp=true|title=Pentagon plans to shoot down disabled satellite}}</ref> U.S. Officials point out that the U.S. had no reason to prove that it could shoot down a satellite as it did this in the 1980s, and that this launch was publicly announced. Another key difference pointed out by General Cartwright was that this intercept happened at a much lower altitude, whereas China<U+2019>s ASAT weapon destroyed a target at a much higher altitude and now poses a danger to other spacecraft. Finally, U.S. officials say that the mission<U+2019>s intent was to preserve human life.<ref name="Pentagon">{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1447206620080214?sp=true|title=Pentagon plans to shoot down disabled satellite}}</ref>
