'''Stoneybridge''' ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]: ''Staoinebrig'') is a small town in [[Scotland]], situated on the isle of [[South Uist]].

The town was given large recognition by the Anglo-Scottish comedy show, [[Absolutely (TV series)|Absolutely]], that used "Stoneybridge" as the base for one of the recurring plots in the show. This portrayal of Stoneybridge was intended as a [[satire]] of the isolation and insularism of Scottish villages and how things that are taken for granted are seen as wonders to small communities. The portrayal is also a [[parody]] of local politics and the petty [[Bonapartism]] of local council leaders.  However, the cast claim that they were unaware of the existence of a real Stoneybridge when writing the original scripts.
