The '''Detroit Eight Mile Wal'''l, also referred to as Detroit's [[Wailing Wall]], [[Berlin Wall]] or The Birdwood Wall; is a foot thick, six foot high wall that stretches about half a mile in length. Starting in a playground and extending in a north-south direction from just south of 8 mile Road toward Van Antwerp Park in northwest Detroit. It is a wall of racial separation erected in 1940 as a physical barrier between white and black homeowners.

'''Background'''

The 1930's and 1940's were times of suburban focused growth for the Metro Detroit Area. This suburban sprawl led to a boom in development for the surrounding areas, shifting focus and money away from the city. The [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA),founded in 1934, pushed the idea of home ownership as an accesible goal for the average working class. Private home ownership soon became a building block for the "[[American Dream]]". Thomas J. Sugrue outlines Detroit's unique housing crisis and how the FHA's policies helped shape the face of the city: "[[New Deal]] rhetoric touched a deep nerve among Detroiters who had struggled, usually without the benefit of loans or mortgages, to build their own homes in the city. It reinforced the deeply rooted values of home ownership and family stability held by striving immigrants in the early twentieth century, and appealed to the seldom-met aspirations for landownership and independence held by blacks since emancipation. With government backed loans, they were able to attain the dream of property ownership with relative ease."<ref name="SugrueThomas">Sugrue, Thomas J. [[The Origins of the Urban Crisis]]: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1996. Print</ref>This push for private instead of public housing strengthened the outmigration from the city to the suburbs, sparking what was later coined as [[white flight]]. 
Housing became a racially charged issue, as the idea of public housing grew to represent a threat to private housing. Affordable living for the lower class, usually minorities, meant interference with a successful, free market real estate. Community groups determined to keep their neighborhoods segregated lobbied against public housing projects, while contractors found construction business in private housing. In addition to the racial tensions already present, the FHA's policies of mandated racial homogeneity in housing developments and [[redlining]] made it difficult for African Americans to become home owners. Mortgage loans and other assistance was typically denied to African American neighborhoods and was unfavorably granted to the settlements of close proximity. Between 1930 and 1950, three out of five homes purchased in the United States were financed by FHA, yet less than two percent of the FHA loans were made to non-white home buyers <ref>http://heinonline.org.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jluenvl14&collection=journals&id=9814 J.

'''Eight Mile Community and Construction'''

Public or private housing being hard to come by in the city, some African Americans were able to purchase land lots around the Wyoming Avenue and 8 Mile intersection with hopes of eventually building houses. By the late thirties development had reached the northern limits of the city and had surrounded this area with prosperous neighborhoods of single unit family houses. West Outer Drive, Palmer Woods and Sherwood Forest were the all-white neighborhoods in close proximity to this African American enclave. The area was mostly vacant and unattractive to contractors due to its residents as it violated FHA's policy of racially homogeneous neighborhoods. When the FHA was approached by a developer wanting to build an all-white subdivision west of the cite, funding was refused because the area was too risky for investment. In a compromise with the FHA, the developer erected the wall that was to divide the "slum" from his new construction project.<ref name="SugrueThomas" />
