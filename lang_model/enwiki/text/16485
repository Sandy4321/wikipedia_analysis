'''Rawalpindi''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''<U+0631><U+0627><U+0648><U+0644><U+067E><U+0646><U+0688><U+0649>'''}}}}, ''R<U+0101>walpi<U+1E45><U+1E0B><U+012B>''), commonly known as '''Pindi''', is a city in the [[Pothohar]] region of [[Pakistan|Pakistan.]] Rawalpindi is only located 9 miles from the city of [[Islamabad]], in the [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|province]] of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. Rawalpindi is the [[List of most populous metropolitan areas in Pakistan|fourth largest city]] in Pakistan after [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]] and [[Faisalabad]]. In the 1950s, Rawalpindi was smaller than [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] and [[Multan]], but the city's economy received a boost during the building of Islamabad (1959&ndash;1969), when Rawalpindi served as the national capital and its population increased from 180,000 at the time of independence to over 4.5 million in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Rawalpindi is in the northernmost part of the [[Punjab]] province, {{convert|275|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of [[Lahore]]. It is the administrative seat of the [[Rawalpindi District]]. The total area of the city is approximately {{Convert|108.8|km2|sqmi}}. Rawalpindi is the military headquarters of the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]].

Rawalpindi, named after Raja Pindi, is a bustling city on the northernmost part of the Punjab province, strategically located between [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]]. Many tourists use the city as a stop before traveling towards the northern areas. Rawalpindi is a prime destination for the expatriate community of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]]. Numerous shopping bazaars, parks and a cosmopolitan population attract shoppers from all over Pakistan and abroad. The city is home to several industries and factories. [[Islamabad International Airport]] is in Rawalpindi and serves both cities.

==History==
[[File:Gulshan Dadn Khan Maseet, Rawalpindi.JPG|thumb|300px|The Mosque at Gulshan Dadan Khan]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:rwpmap.jpg|thumb|left|A map representing the Rawalpindi Division.]] -->
Rawalpindi has been inhabited for thousands of years, it is believed that a distinct culture flourished on this plateau as far back as c. 1000 BC. The material remains found at the site prove the existence of a [[Buddhist]] establishment contemporary to [[Taxila]] and of a [[Vedic civilisation]]. The nearby town of Taxila has another significance; according to the Guinness Book of World Records it has the world's oldest university - [[Takshashila]] University.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gurudev|title=Takshashila <U+2013> World<U+2019>s Oldest University|url=http://www.hitxp.com/articles/history/takshashila-taxila-oldest-university/|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> In Takshashila, 12 miles north-west of Rawalpindi, traces of at least 55 [[stupa]]s, 28 Buddhist monasteries, 9 temples, a copper plate inscribed with the name Takshashila, a vase with [[Kharoshthi]] script among other things have been found.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=tK-nRXoQ40oC&lpg=PA262&dq=rawalpindi%20buddhism&pg=PA262#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Buddhist Sects in India |first=Nalinaksha |last=Dutt

Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] identified certain ruins on the site of the cantonment with the ancient city of Ganjipur or Gajnipur, the capital of the Bhatti tribe in the ages preceding the Christian era. Graeco-Bactrian coins, together with ancient bricks, occur over an area of 500 [[Hectare|ha]] (2&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>). Known within historical times as Fatehpur Baori, Rawalpindi fell into decay during one of the Mongol invasions in the 14th century.<ref name="IGI">{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_278.gif |title=Imperial Gazetter of India, Volume 21, page 272 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |date=2013-02-18 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>

It appears that the ancient city went into oblivion as a result of the [[White Hun]] devastation. The first [[Muslim]] invader, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (979-1030), gave the ruined city to a [[Gakhars|Gakhar]] Chief, [[Kai Gohar]]. The town, however, being on an invasion route, could not prosper and remained deserted until [[Jhanda Khan]], another [[Gakhars|Gakhar]] Chief, restored it and named it Rawalpindi after the village Rawal in 1493. Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the [[Gakkhars]] until [[Muqarrab Khan]], the last [[Gakkhar]] ruler, was defeated by the [[Sikh]]s under [[Sardar Milka Singh]] in 1765. Singh invited traders from the neighbouring commercial centres of [[Jhelum (city)|Jhelum]] and [[Shahpur (Punjab)|Shahpur]] to settle in the territory.<ref name="IGI"/>

Early in the 19th century Rawalpindi became for a time the refuge of [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]], the exiled king of [[Afghanistan]], and of his brother Shah Zaman. The present native infantry lines mark the site of a battle fought by the Gakhars under their famous chief Sultan Mukarrab Khan in the middle of the 18th century. Rawalpindi was taken by Sikh ruler [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1818.

===British rule===
[[File:The Mess Hall Rawalpindi.jpg|thumb|left|The Mess Hall, Rawalpindi]]
[[File:Queen Victoria's Statue, Rawalpindi, 1939.jpg|thumb|Queen Victoria's Statue sculpted in England was placed in the city during the rule of the British Empire, 1939]]

Following the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] invasion of the region and their occupation of Rawalpindi in 1849, the city became a permanent [[garrison]] of the British army in 1851. In the late 1870s a railway line to Rawalpindi was laid, and train service was inaugurated on 1 October 1880. The need for a railway link arose after [[Earl of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] made Rawalpindi the headquarters of the Northern Command and the city became the largest [[British army|British military]] garrison in [[British India]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On the introduction of British rule, Rawalpindi became the site of a [[cantonment]] and, shortly afterward, the headquarters of the [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]]. Its connection with the main railway system by the extension of the [[North Western Railway (British India)|North-Western Railway]] to [[Peshawar]] immensely developed its size and commercial importance. The municipality was created in 1867.

Rawalpindi at the beginning of the 1900s became the most important cantonment in the [[British Raj]] - the colonial dominion of the Indic or South Asian sub-continent. For example, the municipality's population in 1901 population was 40 611, larger than any other cantonment. Its income and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged 180 000 and 210 000 Rs. ([[rupee]]s), respectively. Income derived mostly (89%) from municipal import duties ([[octroi]]) which in that year ran 160 000 Rs. Expenditure included administration (35 000 Rs. or 17%), conservancy (27 000 Rs. or 13%), hospitals and dispensaries (25 000 Rs. or 12%), public works (9 000 Rs. or 3%), and public safety (17 000 Rs. or %).

The cantonment was a major center of military power of the Raj after an arsenal was established in 1883.<ref name="IGI"/>  In 1901 Rawalpindi was the winter headquarters of the Northern Command and of the Rawalpindi military division. It quartered six [[regiment]]s - one each of British and Native cavalry; two each of British and Native infantry; three [[company|companies]], one of garrison artillery and two of sappers and miners, including a balloon section; three [[Artillery battery|batteries]] - one each of horse, field artillery, and mountain; and one [[ammunition column]] of field artillery. It has been recently disclosed that the British Government tested poison gas on Indian troops during a series of [[Rawalpindi experiments|experiments]] that lasted over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-09-01-3612902635_x.htm |title=UK tested poison gas on Indian soldiers |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>

===Post-independence===
The predominantly Muslim population supported [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]].  After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to [[India]] while the [[Muslim]] refugees from [[India]] settled in the Rawalpindi. In the succeeding years, Rawalpindi saw an influx of [[Muhajir people|Muhajir]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] settlers. In 1959, the city became the interim capital of the country after President [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] sought the creation of a new planned capital of Islamabad in the vicinity of Rawalpindi. As a result, Rawalpindi saw most major central government offices and institutions relocate to nearby territory, and its population boom.

In 1951, Rawalpindi saw the assassination of the first elected [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] in Company Bagh now known as [[Liaquat National Bagh|Liaquat Bagh Park]] (also called Liaquat Garden.) On 27 December 2007, Liaquat Bagh Park's rear gate in Rawalpindi was the site of the [[Benazir Bhutto assassination|assassination]] of former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]].<ref name="bhutto">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7161590.stm| title=Benazir Bhutto killed in attack| publisher=BBC| date=2007-12-27| accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> Her father, former [[Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] was hanged in Rawalpindi in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siddiqui|first=Salman|title=No Morning English Daily Carried the News of Bhutto's Hanging|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/143320|publisher=Daily Dawn|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Murree road rawalp galleryfull.jpeg|thumb|The Murree Road during the construction of Committee Chowk Underpass]]
The famous [[Murree Road]] has been a hot spot for various political and social events. Nala Lai, in the middle of city, history describes Nala Lai water as pure enough for drinking but now it has become polluted with the waste water from all sources including factories and houses. Kashmir Road, was renamed from Dalhousie Road, Haider road from Lawrence road, Bank Road from Edwards Road, Hospital Road from Mission Road, Jinnah Road from Nehru Road. Today Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the [[Pakistani Army]]. [[Pakistan Air Force]] also has an active airbase in the [[Chaklala]] region of Rawalpindi.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan Air Force|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/march98/paf1.htm|publisher=Defense General|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PAF Active Bases|url=http://www.paf.gov.pk/active_bases.html|publisher=Pakistan Air Force|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>

==Boundary and expansion==
Though Rawalpindi has expanded mostly due to explosive population pressure, [[Nespak]] has been given the responsibility to render the urban planning services<U+2014>analysing available data and other documents like master plans, structure plans, outline development plans and census reports. It is also responsible for defining the geographical features of the city and provides the a rough idea of how the city could be expanded in the next 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://momers.tumblr.com/tagged/rawalpindi |title=It Be Blog |publisher=Momers.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GFregGyy1C6hNNfzylvSkQ?feat=embedwebsite |title=Picasa Web Albums - Omer Sheikh |publisher=Picasaweb.google.com |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref>

Wind gusts have been reported by [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]] to have reached 167&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) in such thunder/wind storms which results in damage of infrastructure especially electric poles, billboards and sometimes buildings too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/OPRN/2006/10/13/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA |title=Weather History for Islamabad, Pakistan &#124; Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>
Rawalpindi is chaotic but relatively dust-free. The weather is highly variable due to the location of the city.
