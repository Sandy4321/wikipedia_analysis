'''Imiaslavie''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+043C><U+044F><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0438><U+0435>}}) or '''Imiabozhie''' (<U+0418><U+043C><U+044F><U+0431><U+043E><U+0436><U+0438><U+0435>), also spelled imyaslavie or imyabozhie, and also referred as '''onomatodoxy''', is a dogmatic movement which was condemned by the Russian Orthodox Church, but that is still promoted by some affiliated with Gregory Lourie of the "Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church" (a splinter group of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]), and by some other contemporary Russian writers (many of whom are associated with St. Sergius Theological Seminary in Paris), which asserts that the [[name of God|name of the God]] is [[God]] Himself. The movement emerged in the beginning of the 20th century but both proponents and opponents claim its connections with much religious thought throughout the history of [[Christianity]] (proponents claim its connections to the [[Church Fathers]], while opponents claim the connections to the ancient [[heresiarch]]s).

==Beginning==
The 20th century history of Imiaslavie started in [[1907]] with the publication of the book ''On the [[Caucasus Mountains]]'' by a revered [[Monk#Eastern Orthodox Monks|Schema-monk]] [[starets]], Illarion. In his book Illarion told of his spiritual experience with the [[Jesus Prayer]] as a proof that The name of the God is God Himself and can produce miracles. The book became extremely popular among the Russian monks on [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]]. Many of them argued that since according to [[Plato]] ''The name of an object existed before the object itself'' so the name of the God must be pre-created before the world and cannot be anything but God Himself. Among other things it might mean that knowledge of the secret name of God allows one to make miracles. It also required an extreme caution with the use of names like [[Jehovah]], [[Christ]], etc. 
Their opponents, the other Athos monks, consider this teaching as [[pantheism]] incompatible with Christianity. They argue that before the Creation God did not need the name, so the name was created and is actually an empty sound having no mystical attributes by itself.
The proponents got the name ''Imyaslavtsy'' (those who glorify the Name) and the opponents got the name ''Imyabortsy'' (those who fight the Name). 

The main proponent of the Imiaslavie doctrine was a [[Hieromonk]] of the Andreyevsky [[skete]] of Athos Mountain, [[Alexander Bulatovich|Anthony Bulatovich]], who published a few books on it. Those who promote this doctrine claim support from the writings of Saint [[John of Kronstadt]], and the influential [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[healer]] [[Grigori Rasputin]]. It should be pointed out, however, that St. John reposed before this controversy erupted, and these quotes, it can be argued, are taken out of context to support a whole set of ideas that are not found in the writings of St. John.<ref>Vladimir Moss observes: "As another example of how the name-worshippers distort the holy fathers, let us consider their oft-repeated claim that St. John of Kronstadt believed that the Name of God was God. Now it is quite true that St. John sometimes employed expressions which, taken out of context, might lead one to believe that he was a name-worshipper. But the context was always prayer; and the point St. John was always trying to make was that in true, heartfelt prayer, no distinction is felt between God and the Name of God. And this, as we have seen, is perfectly true. But that St. John did not confuse the subjective identification of <U+201C>Jesus<U+201D> and Jesus in prayer with their objective identification in reality is evident from the following: <U+00AB>Let not the heart weak in faith think that the cross or the name of Christ act of themselves, or that this cross and this name of Christ produces miracles when I do not look with the eyes of my heart or with the faith of Christ<U+201D>.[105] These words of St. John contradict one of the main theses of name-worshipping, namely, that the name of God, being God Himself, works of itself ." (The Name Worshipping Heresy, April 2, 2007 <http://uk.geocities.com/guildfordian2002/Polemics/TheNameEnglish.htm>)</ref> 

The most vocal opponent was the [[archbishop]] of [[Volyn]] [http://orthodoxwiki.org/Anthony_%28Khrapovitsky%29_of_Kiev Anthony Khrapovitsky], who considered imiaslavie as a variation of [[Khlysts]] heresy (khlystovschina). In [[1912]] by the decision of the [[Holy Synod]] the book ''On the Caucasus Mountains'' became forbidden in Russia. It was not reprinted until [[1998]]. In September 1912 the book was judged by [[Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople]], who gave a negative opinion about it (though in [[1907]] he supported the same book).

In January 1913 a monk by the name of David, who was a supporter of Imiaslavie, was elected as the [[hegumen]] of the Andreyevsky [[skete]]. He took the place of the monk Hieronim who was an opponent of it. Hieronim did not recognize the results of the elections and complained to the Russian Embassy in Greece. The Imperial Government insisted on changing the hegumen back. In April the teaching of Imiaslavie was also proclaimed [[pantheism]] by the new [[Patriarch Germanus V of Constantinople]].

==Storming the monastery==

[[Image:Athos 7.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Modern view of the [[Rossikon|St. Panteleimon Monastery]] ]]
In June of 1913 a small Russian fleet, consisting of the [[gunboat]] ''Donets'' and the transport ships ''Tsar'' and ''Kherson'', delivered the archbishop of [[Vologda]], Nikon Rozhdestvensky, and a number of troops to Mount Athos. The poll organized by the archbishop had shown that among 1700 of the [[Rossikon]]'s monks, 661 monks identified themselves as imiabortsy, 517 as imiaslavtsy, 360 refused to participate in the poll, and the rest identified themselves as neutral. In May and June the archbishop Nikon held talks with the imiaslavtsy and tried to make them change their beliefs voluntarily, but was unsuccessful. On [[July 31]] the troops stormed the [[Rossikon|St. Panteleimon Monastery]]. Although the monks were not armed and did not actively resist, the troops showed very heavy-handed tactics. They set up two machine guns and a number of water cannons, and the soldiers were ordered to beat the monks with their bayonets and rifle butts. Allegedly, four monks were killed and at least forty-eight were wounded. After the storming of St. Panteleimon Monastery the monks from the Andreevsky Skete surrendered voluntarily.

The military transport ''Kherson'' was converted into a prison ship. It took 628 monks to Russia and on [[July 9]] set sail to [[Odessa]]. Forty monks were left in the Mt. Athos hospital, judged unable to survive the transportation. On [[July 14]] the steamship ''Chikhachev'' delivered another 212 monks from Mt. Athos. The rest of the monks signed papers that they rejected the imiaslavie. 

After interrogation in Odessa, 8 imprisoned monks were returned to Athos, 40 put into a jail, and the rest were defrocked and exiled to different areas of the Russian Empire according to their [[propiska]].
One of the leaders of imiaslavtsy, [[Antony Bulatovich]], was sent to his family estate in the village Lebedinka of [[Kharkov]] [[gubernia]], to where many imiaslavtsy moved.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Bulatovich.jpg|right|thumb| [[Alexander Bulatovich]] tonsured Hieromonk Antony. Leader of Imiaslavtsy]]
In February [[1914]] some imiaslavtsy were received by the Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. The kind reception was considered a sign of a changing fate. In May [[1914]] Moscow Metropolitan Makariy and the Moscow Synodal Office decided to accept the imiaslavtsy into church services without them having to repent, as ''there was nothing to repent about.'' A similar decision was taken by the [[Kiev]] Metropolitan. On [[May 10]] the decision was partially adopted by the Holy Synod that the imiaslavtsy were allowed to keep their positions in the Orthodox Church without a formal repentance, but it specified that the teaching itself was still to be considered a heresy.

On [[27 August]] [[1914]] the leader of the movement Anthony Bulatovich asked to be sent as an Army priest to [[World War I]], his request was granted by the Holy Synod. On [[July 1]] [[1915]] the Holy Synod got a letter from the original author, schema-monk Illarion, asking whether he was expelled from the Church (Illarion lived as a hermit in the Caucasus Mountains and seems to be unaware of all the commotion over his book). Illarion died on [[June 2]] [[1916]], without having received an answer. In September [[1917]] the Pomestny [[Sobor]] of the Russian Orthodox Church was assembled to solve the problem with Imiaslavie, with both strong proponents and opponents of Imiaslavie present. The work of the Sobor was aborted due to the [[October Revolution]]. Among the theologians who spoke out for Imiaslavie was Saint [[Pavel Florensky]] and [[Sergey Bulgakov]].

In October [[1918]] the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church canceled the decision allowing imyaslavtsy to participate in church services unless they repented. The decision was signed by [[Patriarch]] [[Tikhon of Moscow]]. In January [[1919]] the leader of the imyaslavtsy, Anthony Bulatovich, broke relations with the Holy Synod and Tikhon and returned to his family estate in Lebedinka. There, he was killed either by robbers or by soldiers of the Red Army in December.

The question of compatibility between Orthodoxy and the Imiaslavie is still hotly argued by some theologians.  Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]], in 1999, wrote: "Even though the movement of the 'Name-worshippers' was crushed at the beginning of the century on the orders of the Holy Synod, discussion of the matter regained impetus in the years preceding the Moscow Council (1917-18), which was supposed to come to a decision about this but did not succeed in doing so. Thus the Church<U+2019>s final assessment of Name-worshipping remains an open question to this day." <ref>http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/11/1/1.aspx</ref>

==Imiaslavie and Buddhism==

One fascinating and unexplored parallel lies with the [[Pure Land]] schools of [[Buddhism]] in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. They both revere the [[Nembutsu]], the formulaic name of [[Amida Buddha]] (Namu Amida Butsu), as the sole method in this latter age of "degenerate [[Dharma]]" (mappo) for birth in the Pure Land after earthly death. [[Shinran]], the founder of the Japanese Pure Land sect of [[Jodo Shinshu]], went so far as to declare the Name as the same as Amida and his characteristics (Infinite Light and Infinite Life).

That two different religions separated by time and space arrived at a similar reverence for the sound of the name of their Deity is the subject material [[Joseph Campbell]] studied during his lifetime.

[[J.D. Salinger]] also mentions this parallel in his book [[Franny and Zooey]].

==Imiaslavie and mathematics==

The Russian Mathematic School is considered by some to have been created by [[Dmitri Egorov]] and [[Nikolai Luzin]], both of whom were ''Imiaslavtsy'' and personal friends of Saint [[Pavel Florensky]] as well as philosopher [[Aleksei Losev]] (both imiaslavtsy in theology) [http://www.amacad.org/publications/bulletin/spring2005/graham.pdf],[http://www.examen.ru/db/Examine/catdoc_id/83E7BCE52BD8AEA5C3256A5E00639D14/rootid/9327995FB7A6D40FC3256A02002CE0D5/defacto.html]. Florensky was a pupil of Egorov and a classmate of Luzin, and they published together. Florensky published works on the parallels between abstract mathematics and religion. Stating that the mathematics of continuous [[function (mathematics)|function]]s is like [[rationalism]] while some concepts, such as transfinite numbers, can be explained only in the framework of the Imiaslavie philosophy, where the Name of God is God Himself.

Math Historians Loren Graham and Jean-Michel Kantor state the works of the Russian Mathematics school is still filled with this mysticism as opposed to the French Mathematics school which is considered to be based in rationalism.
