'''Fieldcrest Cannon Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] stadium in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]]. It is the home venue for the [[Kannapolis Intimidators]], the Class A affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]].

== History ==
When the Intimidators franchise (then known as the Piedmont Phillies) began play in [[1995 in sports|1995]], the stadium's construction was not complete. The field and seating areas were ready for the team's first game in April of that year, but the concession stands, restrooms, luxury boxes, and box office were not complete until that winter. The stadium was named for the [[Cannon Mills Corporation| Fieldcrest Cannon Corporation]], the textile giant that built the mill town of Kannapolis and operated it until the city was incorporated in 1984.

In addition to home games for the Intimidators, Fieldcrest Cannon Stadium is also used for several local high school baseball games each spring in addition to select [[Amateur Athletic Union]] events throughout the year. 

The stadium was the home of [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte|UNC Charlotte's]] baseball team during the 2003 season while their on-campus facility's playing surface was being redone.  The 49ers played in Kannapolis again for the first part of the 2007 season while their stadium was undergoing a $6 million renovation.

A new scoreboard was installed in center field for the 2005 season, replacing the original board that the stadium used when it opened.
