Colonel '''L<U+00EA> Quang Tung''' (1923 &ndash; [[November 1]], [[1963]]) was the commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces]] under the command of [[Ngo Dinh Nhu|Ng<U+00F4> <U+00D0><U+00EC>nh Nhu]], the brother of [[South Vietnam]]'s president, [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ng<U+00F4> <U+0110><U+00EC>nh Di<U+1EC7>m]]. A former servant of the Ng<U+00F4> family, Tung's military background was in security and counterespionage. During the 1950s, Tung was a high-ranking official in Nhu's [[Can Lao Party|C<U+1EA7>n Lao Party]], the secret [[Roman Catholic]] organisation which maintained the Ng<U+00F4> family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted directly to the rank of colonel and became the commander of the special forces. Tung's period at the helm of South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the [[Vietcong|Vi<U+1EC7>t C<U+1ED9>ng]] insurgents. His most well-known attack was the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raid on X<U+00E1> L<U+1EE3>i Pagoda]] on [[August 21]], [[1963]] in which hundreds were believed to have died. Tung's main military program was a scheme in which [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] personnel attempted to infiltrate [[North Vietnam]] in order to engage in intelligence gathering and sabotage. The program was ineffective, with the vast majority of infiltrators being killed or captured. Tung was also reported to be planning an assassination attempt on [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], the [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam]].

Following the pagoda raids, the US terminated funding to Tung's men because they were used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup]]. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup in order to give a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General [[Ton That Dinh|T<U+00F4>n Th<U+1EA5>t <U+0110><U+00ED>nh]], who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the coup plot. <U+0110><U+00ED>nh tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.

Tung was born in 1923 in [[Provinces_of_Vietnam#Regions|central Vietnam]], which was then the protectorate of [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] in [[French Indochina]]. The former servant of the Ng<U+00F4> family was devoutly [[Roman Catholic]],<ref>Karnow, p. 123.</ref> short and bespectacled. Serving a family dictatorship concerned purely with maintaining unadulterated power, Tung had a military background almost entirely in security and counterespionage, which was an unusual basis for leading the special forces. Tung had first served the French as a security officer in central Vietnam. He then worked for Di<U+1EC7>m as a lieutenant in the military security service in central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's [[Can Lao Party|C<U+1EA7>n Lao Party]]<Ref name="j301"/> &ndash; the secret Roman Catholic party that maintained the Ng<U+00F4> family's grip on power &ndash; Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen.<ref name="shap"/> Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unstinting loyalty towards Di<U+1EC7>m and was hated by generals such as [[Nguyen Khanh|Nguy<U+1EC5>n Kh<U+00E1>nh]] and [[Ton That Dinh|T<U+00F4>n Th<U+1EA5>t <U+0110><U+00ED>nh]].<ref name="j301">Jones, p. 301.</ref> In 1960, he was promoted straight to the rank of colonel and put in charge of the special forces.<ref name="shap">{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Shaplen| title=The lost revolution: Vietnam 1945&ndash;1965 | year=1965 |publisher=[[Andre Deutsch]] |pages=p. 190}}</ref> The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.<ref>Prochnau, p. 368.</ref>

Tung had been trained by the CIA in the US.<ref>Karnow, p. 307.</ref> A Di<U+1EC7>m loyalist, he led a force of 1,840&nbsp;men,<ref name="langguth">{{cite book| title=Our Vietnam| first=A.

During this period, the Buddhist majority engaged in mass protests against the pro-Catholic policies of the Di<U+1EC7>m regime.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 143&ndash;150.</ref> On [[August 21]] [[1963]], Tung's men, acting on Nhu's orders, [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raided]] [[Xa Loi Pagoda|X<U+00E1> L<U+1EE3>i]], Saigon's main Buddhist temple. The attacks were replicated across the nation, leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds.<Ref name="k317"/><ref name="raid">Jacobs, pp. 152&ndash;153.</ref> The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400&nbsp;[[bhikkhu|monks]] and [[Bhikkhuni|nuns]] were arrested.<ref name="raid"/> The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare [[martial law]]. Nhu knew that the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers.<ref>Hammer, pp. 166&ndash;167.</ref> As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought that the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country.<ref>Jones, pp. 299&ndash;309.</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War| authorlink=Michael Maclear |first=Michael |last=Maclear |year=1981 |publisher=[[Methuen]] | pages =pp. 89&ndash;90| isbn=0-423-00580-4}}</ref> Following the attacks, US officials threatened to withhold aid to the Special Forces unless they were used in fighting communists, rather than attacking dissidents.<ref name="langguth"/><ref name="encyc">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War| first= Spencer C. |last=Tucker |year=2000 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]| pages =p. 227| isbn=1-57607-040-0}}</ref>

Another notable religious attack was perpetrated by Tung's men in 1963. A hugely oversized [[carp]] was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of [[Da Nang|<U+0110><U+00E0> N<U+1EB5>ng]]. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a [[reincarnation]] of one of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s disciples. As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, so disquiet grew among the district chief and his subordinates, who answered to [[Ngo Dinh Can|Ng<U+00F4> <U+0110><U+00EC>nh C<U+1EA9>n]], another younger brother of Di<U+1EC7>m. The officials [[land mine|mined]] the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the carp again escaped death. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in Tung's special forces. Tung's men [[hand grenade|grenaded]] the pond, finally killing the carp. The killing backfired, because it generated more publicity &ndash; many newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.<ref>Prochnau, p. 411.</ref>

Tung also headed a group run by the CIA, in which ARVN personnel of northern origin infiltrated [[North Vietnam]], posing as locals. The objective was to gather intelligence and sabotage communist infrastructure and communications facilities. The recruits were trained in bases at [[Nha Trang]], <U+0110><U+00E0> N<U+1EB5>ng and sometimes offshore in [[Taiwan]], [[Guam]] and [[Okinawa]]. Around eighty groups of operatives, each numbering six or seven men, were deployed in 1963. They entered the north via parachute drops or [[sampan]] journeys at night, but nearly all were captured or killed. The captives were frequently used in communist propaganda broadcasts. Tung was heavily criticised for his management of the operations.<ref name="encyc"/><ref>Karnow, p. 378.</ref>

At Nhu's request, Tung was reported to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the [[Consulate General of the United States in Ho Chi Minh City|US Embassy]]. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader [[Thich Tri Quang|Th<U+00ED>ch Tr<U+00ED> Quang]], who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.<ref>Jones, p. 393.</ref>

== US sanctions ==
{{seealso|Cable 243|Krulak Mendenhall mission|McNamara Taylor mission}}
Following the pagoda raids, the US began to explore the possibility of replacing Di<U+1EC7>m. [[Cable 243]] informed the US embassy to look for alternative leadership if Di<U+1EC7>m did not remove Nhu.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 163&ndash;164.</ref> In September, the [[Krulak Mendenhall mission]] was despatched to South Vietnam to analyse the domestic situation and the war against the communists.<Ref>Jones, pp. 356&ndash;357.</ref> One of the resulting suggestions was to terminate funding of the special forces as an expression of disapproval of Tung and Nhu's actions. Another proposal was to run covert campaigns to discredit Tung.<ref>Jones, p. 359.</ref> The Krulak Mendenhall mission ended in a stalemate,<ref name="k309"/> so the [[Kennedy administration]] followed up with the [[McNamara Taylor mission]]. The second expedition resulted in the suspension of funding for the special forces until they were placed under the command of the army's Joint General Staff (JGS) and sent into battle.<Ref>Jones, p. 390.</ref><ref>Hammer, pp. 246&ndash;247.</ref> The McNamara Taylor mission's report noted that one of the reasons for sending Tung's men into the field was because they "are a continuing support for Di<U+1EC7>m".<ref name="h2356">Hammer, pp. 235&ndash;236.</ref> The Americans were also aware that removing the special forces from Saigon would increase the chances that a coup attempt would succeed, thereby encouraging the army to overthrow the president.<Ref name="h2356"/> Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu were undeterred by suspension of aid, keeping Tung and his men in the capital.<ref>Hammer, pp. 272&ndash;273.</ref> In private talks with US officials, Di<U+1EC7>m insisted that the army was responsible for the pagoda attacks and that Tung's men were already under the control of the JGS.<Ref>Hammer, p. 282.</ref>

== Coup and assassination ==
{{seealso|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem}}
By September, Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu knew that a group of generals were planning a coup.<ref name="k318">Karnow, p. 318.</ref> Nhu ordered Tung and [[Ton That Dinh|T<U+00F4>n Th<U+1EA5>t <U+0110><U+00ED>nh]] &ndash; a loyalist general who commanded the ARVN III Corps that encompassed the [[Saigon]] region<ref name="k317">Karnow, p. 317.</ref> &ndash; to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick anti-government dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated.<Ref name="j3989">Jones, pp. 398&ndash;399.</ref> Another objective was to provide a public relations stunt that would give a false impression of the strength of the regime.<ref name="k318"/>

Codenamed [[Operation Bravo]], the first stage of the scheme involved some of Tung's loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup. Tung would then announce the formation of a "revolutionary government" consisting of opposition activists, while Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu pretended to be on the run. This was to be followed by a fake "counter-coup", whereupon Tung's Special Forces, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists, as well as <U+0110><U+00ED>nh's forces would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Di<U+1EC7>m regime. Nhu would then exploit the scare to round up dissidents.<ref name="encyc"/><ref name="k319">Karnow, p. 319.</ref>

However, Nhu and Tung were unaware that <U+0110><U+00ED>nh was part of the real coup plot. The III Corps commander told Tung that the counter-coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force. He said that tanks were required "because armour is dangerous". In an attempt to outwit Tung, <U+0110><U+00ED>nh said that fresh troops were needed,<ref name="j399">Jones, p. 399.</ref> opining:

{{quote|If we move reserves into the city, the Americans will be angry. They'll complain that we're not fighting the war. So we must camouflage our plan by sending the special forces out to the country. That will deceive them.<Ref name="j399"/>}}

The loyalists were unaware that <U+0110><U+00ED>nh's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the president.<Ref name="k319"/> Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital on Saigon on [[October 29]].<ref name="j399"/>

[[Image:Diem dead.jpg|The body of Di<U+1EC7>m in the back of an armoured personnel carrier. The president had been executed on the way to military headquarters|thumb|right|150px]]

On [[November 1]], Tung was summoned by the coup organisers to the Joint General Staff headquarters at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|T<U+00E2>n S<U+01A1>n Nh<U+1EE9>t Air Base]], on the pretext of a routine officers' lunch meeting.<ref name="j408">Jones, p. 408.</ref> At 13:30, General [[Tran Van Don|Tr<U+1EA7>n V<U+0103>n <U+0110><U+00F4>n]] announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not. He was taken away by [[Nguyen Van Nhung|Nguy<U+1EC5>n V<U+0103>n Nhung]], the bodyguard of General [[Duong Van Minh|D<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng V<U+0103>n Minh]], another of the coup plotters. As he was led away, Tung shouted "Remember who gave you your stars!"<ref name="encyc"/><ref name="j408"/><ref>Karnow, p. 321.</ref>

During the early stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend [[Ho Chi Minh City Museum|Gia Long Palace]].<Ref>Jones, p. 410.</ref><Ref>Hammer, p. 287.</ref> At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Di<U+1EC7>m on the phone, telling the president that he had told his men to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Di<U+1EC7>m loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids.<Ref name="j414"/><ref>Hammer, p. 290.</ref> The generals were well aware of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning,<ref>Karnow, p. 310.</ref><ref>Jones, p. 325.</ref> having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.<ref>Jones, p. 388.</ref>

At nightfall he was taken with Major [[Le Quang Trieu|L<U+00EA> Quang Tri<U+1EC7>u]], his brother and deputy,<ref name="encyc"/><ref name="ks">Karnow, p. 321.</ref> hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.<ref name="j414">Jones, p. 414.</ref> The coup was successful, and on the following morning, Di<U+1EC7>m and Nhu were captured and executed.<ref name="encyc"/><ref>Karnow, pp. 324&ndash;326.</ref>
