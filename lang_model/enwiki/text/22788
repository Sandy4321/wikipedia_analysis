The '''Anahim hotspot''' is a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in central [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is situated on the [[Interior Plateau]], a large region that lies between the [[Cariboo Mountains|Cariboo]] and [[Monashee Mountains]] to the east, and the [[Hazelton Mountains]], [[Coast Mountains]] and [[Cascade Range]] to the west. As a [[geology|geologic]] hotspot, it is a place that has experienced active volcanism over a long period of time.<ref>{{cite web | title = The San Francisco Volcanic Field-Arizonia's Hotspot | publisher =  Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, [[United States Geological Survey]]  | date = 2007-01-30 | url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2007/07_01_25.html | accessdate = 2008-06-13}}</ref>

Dating back to the mid-[[Miocene]] period, it has recorded changes in the western-moving [[North American Plate]] because it is believed to have been relatively stationary for tens of millions of years. Since then it has formed a line of [[volcano]]es called the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]], stretching from the coast to the Interior Plateau near [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes- Anahim volcanic belt | work = Natural Resources Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2008-02-13 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_anahim_e.php | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> Each of the volcanoes was once over the hotspot, but migration of the North American Plate has pulled the volcanoes away from the hotspot's magmatic source at a rate of {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year.<ref name="GT"/> As a result, the volcanoes are progressively older to the west. The supply and composition of magma to the volcanoes changes with time as the volcanoes grow over the hotspot and migrate away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbari.org/volcanism/Hawaii/HR-HotSpot.htm|title=Hotspot plume dynamics and tectonic migration|accessdate=2008-06-16 |work= |date= 2008-06-13}}</ref>

==Geological history==
===13 to 12 Ma===
The Anahim hotspot has a long history. About 13 and 12 million years ago, the Anahim hotspot created a peralkaline volcanic complex on the coast of British Columbia, now heavily [[erosion|eroded]] to form the ~{{convert|20|km|0|adj=on|lk=on|abbr=on}} long Bella Bella and ~{{convert|6|km|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} long Gale Passage [[dike swarm]]s. Individual dikes are as thick as {{Unit m|20|0}} and have [[basalt]], [[trachyte]], and comendite compositions. The converging dikes may mark the first appearance of the Anahim hotspot.<ref name=QW>{{cite book | last = Ernst | first = Richard E.| coauthors = Kenneth L.

===0.34 Ma to 7,200 BP===
[[Image:Nazko Cone, British Columbia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nazko Cone]], the youngest expression of the Anahim hotspot]]

Throughout the [[Holocene]] epoch, the Anahim hotspot has fed activity to numerous volcanoes. This volcanic activity has produced numerous [[Hawaiian eruption]]s, which created [[lava fountain]]s, small cinder cones and lava flows. The youngest expression of the Anahim hotspot is [[Nazko Cone]], which formed about 340,000 years ago. The most recent eruptive activity at Nazko Cone occurred about 7,200 years ago.<ref name="SI"/> This is very recent in geological terms, suggesting that the volcano may yet have some ongoing volcanic activity. The Rainbow Range is the largest Anahim volcano, although Nazko Cone is now the site of the most intense volcanic activity, located directly on top of the Anahim hotspot at {{coor dms|52|54|0|N|123|44|0|W|type:mountain_region:CA}}.<ref>{{VNUM|1=1200-14-|2=Nazko}} {{accessdate|2007-11-06}}</ref> Its last eruption started with an eruption of two different progressions of runny [[lava|lava flow]]s and an older, grey basalt overlain by a younger, darker black basaltic lava flow. The passive eruptions were followed by a period of [[explosive eruption]]s.<ref name=SI>{{cite web | title = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Nazko Cone | work = Natural Resources Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2005-08-19 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_ncn_032 | accessdate = 2007-11-17}}</ref> This explosive activity built three overlying cinder cones that broke by the two lava flows near the end of the explosive phase of activity. The last phase of explosive activity spread tephra to the north and east of the cones. The deepest deposits near the cone is less than {{Unit m|3|0}} and thin to less than a few centimetres only a few kilometres away,<ref name=SI/> which suggests that the explosive eruptions at Nazko Cone were fairly small. However, the last eruption from Nazko Cone could have started [[wildfire|forest fire]]s, since there is [[charcoal]] inside the [[tephra]] layer.<ref name=SI/>

==Petrology and geochemistry==
[[Image:Anahim Volcanic Belt-en.svg|thumb|left|350px|Path of the Anahim hotspot over the past 13 million years, including the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] ]]

[[Analytical chemistry|Analysis]] of the chemical composition of the lavas gives important clues about the source and dynamics of the hotspot plume. Where hotspots occur under thick [[continental crust]], basaltic [[magma]] is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form [[rhyolite]]s. These rhyolites can be quite hot and form violent eruptions, despite their low water content. Such rhyolitic magma can be found at the western part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, which contrasts the more basaltic material in the Nazko Cone area.<ref name="AD">{{cite web | last = Adderley | first = Chris | coauthors = Weatherley,Sian; Thompson, Mary-Beth| title = Effusive Volcanism Near Quesnel | work = | publisher =  | year= 2007 | url = http://www.geog.ubc.ca/courses/geog376/students/class07/volcanic/index.html  | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> This suggests that as the North American Plate moves westwards, the Anahim hotspot underlies thinner [[continental crust]].<ref name="AD"/> This has been verified by observation of the crustal regime in other compression margins &ndash; the thickest [[granite|granitic]] structures are found near the margin itself, with the North American Plate becoming less compressed with movement away from the margin.<ref name="AD"/> In this case, the thinner crust would result in lower travel time, thus reducing the time available for magma differentiation whose end products are rhyolites.<ref name="AD"/> As most magma is basaltic in origin, the eruption would therefore contain more basaltic materials. A few [[igneous rock]] types with composition unlike basalt, such as [[nephelinite]], do occur at the small basaltic cinder cones and flows but are extremely rare.<ref name="GT"/>
[[Image:Lava fountain at Kilauea.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Anahim eruption would be similar to those at [[K<U+012B>lauea]] in [[Hawaii]]]]

[[Basalt]]ic lava flows have a high ferromagnesian content and erupt at temperatures between 1000<U+00B0>C and 1200<U+00B0>C; these values are higher than those of other common [[igneous rock]]s. Due to the high temperature of this lava flow, the lava would be extremely [[fluid]] (it has low [[viscosity]]), allowing the lava to travel long distances from the magma source (the volcano or vent). These extremely fluid lavas have flow speeds that depend heavily on underlying terrain, with a maximum of almost {{convert|60|km/h|mph|0|lk=on}} in underground [[lava channel]]s.<ref name="AD"/> Flow independent of much channels and tubes moves quite slower, averaging speeds of {{Unit km|1.6|0}} per hour.<ref name="AD"/> However, this flow speed changes considerably within the flow, with speeds depending heavily on depth and degree of cooling that the flow has experienced (essentially distance from the vent). Although the Nazko area flows would not be highly basaltic like those found in [[Iceland]] or [[Hawaii]], lower depths are unlikely as viscosity is normally higher.<ref name="AD"/>

A few volcanic centers in the vicinity of the Bella Bella and Gale Passage dike swarms, such as [[Helmet Peak]] and [[Kitasu Hill]], which are members of the [[Milbanke Sound Group]], may represent the westernmost of the Anahim volcanoes, but there are significant differences in age compared to the other volcanoes in that range. The questions about their origin and connection to other regional volcanic activity are the subject of ongoing research. However, many volcanoes in that center are believed to be [[monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic]], suggesting a [[monogenetic volcanic field]] may be responsible.<ref>{{cite web | title = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes - Kitasu Hill | work = Natural Resources Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2005-08-19 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_khl_031 | doi = | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes- Helmet Peak | work = Natural Resources Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2005-08-19 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/volcano_e.php?id=avb_hpk_030 | doi = | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}</ref>

==Origin==

The source of the Anahim hotspot is not without controversy. Some [[geologist]]s hypothesize that the Anahim hotspot is linked with an upper [[mantle plume]] ([[mantle plume|miniplume]]) rather than the more common deep mantle plume because of the small size of the Bella Bella and Gale Passage [[dike swarm]]s.<ref name=QW>[http://books.google.com/books?id=X4W9aGXDa9cC&pg=PA261&lpg=PA261&dq=anahim+volcanic+belt&source=web&ots=BPqssDdz2O&sig=Ta6jfa_4Ehq_13IhkXtY8JDCYo8#PPA261,M1 Mantle Plumes: Their Identification Through Time] Retrieved on [[2007-11-17]]</ref> Others prefer tensional cracking of the [[lithosphere]] above the northern edge of the [[subduction|subducting]] [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]] plates at the [[Cascadia subduction zone]] or interpreted as an edge effect of the subducting plates in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name="GT">{{cite journal | last = Bevier | first = Mary Lou | coauthors = Armstrong, Richard Lee; Souther, J.

Part of the controversy is due to the rather sudden appearance of the hotspot in the geologic record. A number of hotspot models have been suggested to explain tensional cracking origins, however.

Volcanism appears to have ceased in the western parts of the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]], but if the theory is correct, future eruptive activity can be expected in the [[Nazko Cone]] area and east of it. Future eruptions from the Anahim hotspot is most likely in the form of [[basalt]]ic [[cinder cone]]s, but eruptions of less [[mafic]] magma, typical of the eastern portions of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, cannot be ruled out.<ref>{{cite book | last = Casadevall | first = T.J. |coauthors= [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] et al| title = Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety (U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2047)| publisher = [[United States Government Printing Office]] | date = 1994 |location= [[Washington, D.C.]]| pages = | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=pKY_VLqMTgsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=future+eruptions+in+the+anahim+volcanic+belt+is+most+likely+in+the+form+of+basaltic+cinder+cones&source=web&ots=Nb57MJL9vP&sig=NHyFKIR-hw1rFm4WiA_m3cpicm0&hl=en

The recent earthquake swarms of the Anahim hotspot have caused much interest from [[volcanology|volcanologist]]s and [[seismology|seismologist]]s since the swarm began on [[October 9]] [[2007]].<ref name="AD"/> These earthquakes have increased to over 1,000 with seven stations monitoring the region for further activity. The region's earthquake swarms have given cause to speculation of a possible eruption. However, the possibility of an eruption from current seismic activity is around 10%.<ref name="AD"/> An eruption in the region would not cause many fatalities, due to the region's remoteness. There is active logging and ranching in the region, and people engaged in these activities are at risk. The greatest threats would be from [[wildfire|forest fire]]s and possible health risks to those in the area if [[volcanic gas]]ses or [[eruption column|ash columns]] were released. The Anahim hotspot is situated in the immediate proximity of a major air route. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems.<ref>{{cite web | last = Neal | first = Christina A. | coauthors = Thomas J.
