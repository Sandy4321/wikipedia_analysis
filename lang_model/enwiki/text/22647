The '''Gull-billed Tern''', ''Gelochelidon nilotica'', formerly ''Sterna nilotica'' (Bridge ''et al.'', 2005), is a [[seabird]] of the [[tern]] family Sternidae. 

It breeds in warmer parts of the world in southern [[Europe]] (and a very small isolated population in northern [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]]), temperate and eastern [[Asia]], both coasts of [[North America]], eastern [[South America]] and [[Australia]]. This [[bird]] has a number of geographical races, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details.

All forms show a post-breeding dispersal, but the northern breeders are most [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering  south to [[Africa]], the [[Caribbean]] and northern South America, southern Asia and [[New Zealand]].

This species breeds in colonies on lakes, marshes and coasts. It nests in a ground scrape and lays two to five eggs.

This is a somewhat atypical tern, in appearance like a  ''Sterna'' tern, but with feeding habits more like the ''Chlidonias'' marsh terns, [[Black Tern]] and [[White-winged Tern]]. It used to be grouped in the genus ''[[Sterna]]'' but is now placed on its own in the genus ''Gelochelidon''. 

The Gull-billed Tern does not normally plunge dive for [[fish]] like the other white terns, but feeds on insects taken in flight, and also often hunts over wet fields, to take [[frog]]s and small mammals ([[Mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, etc).

This is a fairly large and powerful tern, similar in size and general appearance to a [[Sandwich Tern]], but the short thick [[Gull|gull-like]] bill, broad wings, long legs and robust body are distinctive. The summer adult has grey upperparts, white underparts, a black cap, strong black bill and black legs. The call is a characteristic ''ker-wik''. 

In winter, the cap is lost, and there is a dark patch through the eye like a [[Forster's Tern]] or a [[Mediterranean Gull]]. Juvenile Gull-billed Terns have a fainter mask, but otherwise look much like winter adults. 

Juvenile Sandwich Terns have a short bill, and are frequently mistaken for Gull-billed Tern where the latter species is uncommon, such as [[North Sea]] coasts.

The Gull-billed Tern is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.
