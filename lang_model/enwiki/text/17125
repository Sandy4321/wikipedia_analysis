The [[Alenia Aeronautica]] '''Sky-X''' is a self-financed [[Unmanned combat air vehicle]] for [[Experimental aircraft|demonstration and research]] purpose; on May 29, 2005 it became the first European-designed [[UAV]] in the over 1000 [[kg]] category to fly with success.<ref>[http://www.alenia-aeronautica.it/en/Products/sky-x.asp Alenia Aeronautica official website]</ref>

==Design and development==

The roll-out of the Sky-X was carried out by Alenia in May 2003 and, after 18 months of development, it first flew at the [[sweden|Swedish]] test area of [[Vidsel]].

After a first test campaign cunducted with ground control in order to explore the whole flight envelope the development has focused on the autonomous flight systems, in particular the ATOL system (Assisted take off and landing), the [[collision avoidance]], the precision autonomous navigation, the sight autonomous landing and attack and the autonomous formation fly capabilities. In 2008 the Sky-X demonstrated the capability of carrying out the join-up maneuvers necessary for [[Aerial refueling|in-fly refueling]] with an [[Alenia C-27J]].<ref>[http://www.deagel.com/news/Sky-X-UAV-Demonstrator-Completes-Autonomous-Flight-Refuelling-Simulation_n000004631.aspx Sky-X UAV Demonstrator Completes Autonomous Flight Refuelling Simulation]</ref>

Thanks to the technologies developed for the Sky-X in 2005 Alenia Aeronautica has joined the [[Dassault nEUROn|nEUROn European program]] with a consistent development share.<ref>[http://www.alenia-aeronautica.it/store/factsheet/factsheet8.pdf Alenia Aereonautica official Neuron data sheet]</ref>
