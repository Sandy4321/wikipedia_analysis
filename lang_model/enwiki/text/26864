'''Iris C. Cummings Critchell''' (born December 21, 1920) is an American aviator and former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimmer who competed at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]]. After an active athletic career in swimming, which included a reign as United States national 200m breaststroke champion from 1936 to 1939, she was accepted into the [[University of Southern California]]'s first Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1939. After graduation she worked as a flight instructor prior to being selected to serve her country during World War II as a member of the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]]. Following the conflict she returned to California, where she developed and taught a curriculum on civilian flight for veterans returning from the war at the University of Southern California.

After racing airplanes competitively during the 1950s, Cummings and her husband Howard Critchell helped found the Bates Aeronautics program at [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1962. They ran it together until Howard retired in 1979, at which point Iris continued alone until the program's end in 1990. A long-time certified FAA Pilot Examiner, she is the recipient of several international aviation awards and is a member of the National Flight Instructors Hall of Fame. In her later years she has remained active as a lecturer, consultant, and curator of the Aeronautical Library Special Collections at Harvey Mudd.

==Early life and athletic career==
Cummings was born in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1920<ref name="SportsReference">{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|coauthors = Jeroen Heijmans, Bill Mallon, and Hilary Evans|title = Iris Cummings Biography and Olympic Results|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|date = September 2010|url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/cu/iris-cummings-1.html|accessdate = 2011-01-12}}</ref> and attended [[Redondo Union High School]]. Her father possessed a [[Doctor of Medicine]] from [[Tufts University School of Medicine]] and also worked as an athletics coach in the early 1900s at [[Columbia University]] and as the athletic director at [[Swarthmore College]] from 1902 through 1908. Her mother was a Greek and Latin teacher. Iris attended the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] as a spectator and began competing in swimming the following year, winning numerous local and regional tournaments. When it was too cold to swim, she remained athletically active through cycling. She was not a member of any club during her first year of competition, but nonetheless placed first in several meets in addition to her participation at the 1933 Southern Pacific Amateur Athletic Union and Pacific Coast championships.<ref name="Oral">{{Cite book|last = Hodak|first = George A.|title = An Olympian's Oral History: Iris Cummings Critchell|publisher = [[LA84 Foundation]]|date = May 1988|location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States|pages = 43|url = http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OralHistory/OHCummingsCritchell.pdf}}</ref>

Cummings joined the [[Los Angeles Athletic Club]] in 1934 and received her first financial support in 1935, helping her attend that year's Far Western Championships.<ref name="Oral"/> She captured the American national 200m breaststroke championship in 1936, which led to her participation in that year's Olympic trials and her selection as a representative from the United States to the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin.<ref name="Women">{{Cite web|title = 2007 Pioneer Hall of Fame|publisher = [[Women in Aviation, International]]|date = 2007|url = http://www.wai.org/pioneers/2007pioneers.cfm|accessdate = 20110-01-12}}</ref> She was required, however, to raise her own funds for travel to the Games and spent much of her time leading up to the tournament collecting money rather than training.<ref name="Oral"/> In the [[Swimming at the 1936 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's 200 metre breaststroke|women's 200 metre breaststroke competition]] she placed fourth in her heat in the opening round and was eliminated.<ref name="SportsReference"/> Despite this, she remained as national champion in the event through 1939,<ref name="Women"/> although she left the LAAC in 1937.

==World War II==
Cummings was among the first people accepted into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939.<ref name="Nile">{{Cite web|title = FAI Awards received by Iris Cummings Critchell (USA)|publisher = [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]]|date = 2007|url = http://www.fai.org/awards/recipient.asp?id=30175|accessdate = 2011-01-12}}</ref> She completed an advanced aerobatics course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor.

==Later life==
Following the war Cummings was called back to USC to develop and teach a curriculum on civilian aviation for returning veterans. She spent much of the 1950s as a housewife, raising her children, but remained active as a part-time flight instructor, as well as helping develop curricula for [[Federal Aviation Administration]] institutions.<ref name="Oral"/> She also raced airplanes competitively during this period and won the 1957 [[Powder Puff Derby]], capturing the first prize pot of $800<ref name="Prize">{{Cite journal|title = Roberts, Critchell Place First in TAR|journal = National Aeronautics|volume = 36<U+2013>39|pages = 26|publisher = [[National Aeronautic Association]]|location = [[Washington, D.C.]]|date = 1957|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4IIPAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Iris+Critchell%22&dq=%22Iris+Critchell%22&hl=en&ei=94k8Tfj2Csmr8Aam0p27Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg|accessdate = 2011-01-23}}</ref> (approximately ${{Inflation|US|800|1957}} in present day terms).
