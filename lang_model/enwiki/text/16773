'''Gnezdovo''' or '''Gnyozdovo''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+043D><U+0451><U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E>}}) is an archeological site located near the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|village]] of [[Gnyozdovo]] in [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. The site contains extensive remains of a Slavic-[[Varangian]] settlement which flourished in the 10th century as a major trade station on the [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]]. 

==Site==
The archaeological site comprises a "citadel" (''gorodische''), formerly situated at the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Svinets River]]s, and a ring of ancient rural settlements (''selitba'') which occupy an area of 17.5 hectares, of which roughly {{m2 to ft2|5000|precision=-2}} had been excavated by the end of the 20th century. This makes the site one of the largest survivals of the [[Viking Age]] in [[Europe]]: only [[Hedeby]] covered a larger territory (24&nbsp;[[hectare]]s), with the sites of [[Birka]] (13&nbsp;hectares), [[Dublin]] (12&nbsp;hectares), [[Ribe]] (10&nbsp;hectares), and [[Gda<U+0144>sk]] (1&nbsp;hectare) trailing behind.<ref>''The New Cambridge Medieval History''. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Page 90.</ref> There are about 3,000 burial mounds, arranged in eight clusters of [[kurgan]]s. Of these, about 1,300 mounds have been explored by Russian and Soviet archaeologists, starting in [[1874]].

There is some disagreement among scholars as to which ethnic element predominated at Gnyozdovo. Although a Varangian presence is pronounced, nineteen mounds out of twenty contain ordinary burials of [[Krivich]] and Baltic men and women.<ref><U+0410><U+0432><U+0434><U+0443><U+0441><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0414>.<U+0410>. <U+0413><U+043D><U+0435><U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0438> <U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0443><U+0442><U+044C>. // <U+041D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0435><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0438>. Moscow, 1972.</ref> The burial rite is mostly [[cremation]]. The most numerous finds are household utensils and pottery. As a general observation, the Gnyozdovo tumuli have parallels with the "[[druzhina]] kurgans" of [[Chernigov]], such as the [[Black Grave]].<ref><U+0421><U+0438><U+0437><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0412>.<U+0418>. <U+041A><U+0443><U+0440><U+0433><U+0430><U+043D><U+044B> <U+0421><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0433><U+0443><U+0431><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438>. // <U+041C><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044B> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0435><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438>, <U+2116>28.

==Finds==
Seven hoards of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Arabian coins and a Byzantine dish bearing an image of [[Simargl]] have shown that the local community carried on a prosperous trade along the Dnieper. The metal objects represented include [[hauberk]]s (not typical for Scandinavian sites), helmets, battle-axes, Carolingian swords, and arrows. Among the more surprising discoveries were an early folding [[razor]] with a copper handle and a pivoted [[scissors]], probably the earliest found in Eastern Europe. 

The most unexpected discovery at Gnyozdovo was a [[Kerch]] amphora with the earliest inscription attested in the [[Old Russian language]]. The excavator has inferred that the word ''<U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0448><U+043D><U+0430>'' (''goru<U+0161>na''), inscribed on the pot in [[Cyrillic]] letters, designates [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] that was kept there.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]], 2nd ed. Article "<U+0413><U+043D><U+0435><U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+044C>".</ref> This explanation has not been universally accepted and the inscription seems to be open to different interpretations.<ref>[[Roman Jakobson]], Linda R.

==Historical background==
As Tatiana Jackson has observed, [[Norse saga]]s contain more detailed information about the [[Western Dvina]] (Norse: ''Dyna'') than about any other river of Eastern Europe.<ref><U+0414><U+0436><U+0430><U+043A><U+0441><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0422>.<U+041D>.

Moscow, 2001. Pages 71-72.</ref> This fact highlights a great importance attached to the Dvina trade route by the Viking merchants-adventurers. 

Gnyozdovo is situated downstream from the Dvina&ndash;Dnieper [[portage]]s, at a point where the Svinets and several small waterways empty into the Dnieper. Like Smolensk at a later period, Gnyozdovo flourished through trade along the Dnieper going south to [[Constantinople]] and north over portages to the Dvina and the [[Lovat River|Lovat]], two rivers flowing to the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>A Slavonic chronicle reports that an important portage existed between the [[Lovat River]] and the Dnieper.</ref> At the time of its establishment, the local citadel served a defensive function against possible attacks on the portages, where the Norse traders would be at their most vulnerable.<ref><U+0411><U+0443><U+043B><U+043A><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0412>.<U+0410>. <U+0413><U+043D><U+0435><U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A> <U+0438> <U+043A><U+0443><U+0440><U+0433><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0435> <U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438> <U+0421><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+041F><U+043E><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+044F>. Leningrad, 1973.</ref> After internal tensions within [[Kievan Rus]] settled down, the site of Gnyozdovo "formed the critical exchange centre and refitting base on the route from the Baltic to the Black Sea".<ref>''A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures'' (ed. by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]]). Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 2000. Page 265.</ref>

The settlement declined in the early years of the [[11th century]], simultaneously with other Varangian trade stations in Eastern Europe. By the end of the century, Gnyozdovo's importance as a trade centre had been completely supplanted by nearby Smolensk.

==Gnyozdovo and Smolensk==
Scholars are not in agreement as to how Gnyozdovo is related to Smolensk (Norse: ''Smaleskja''), situated at the confluence of the Dnieper and the [[Smolnya River]]s. 

According to one point of view, Gnyozdovo was the functional and economic predecessor of modern Smolensk. Soviet archaeologists established that the earliest settlement on the site of Smolensk goes back to the early 11th century.<ref><U+0410><U+0432><U+0434><U+0443><U+0441><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0414>.<U+0418>. <U+041A> <U+0432><U+043E><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443> <U+043E> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0438><U+0441><U+0445><U+043E><U+0436><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0421><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0442><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0444><U+0438><U+0438>. // <U+0421><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0443> 1100 <U+043B><U+0435><U+0442>. Smolensk, 1967.</ref> In other words, the emergence of Smolensk coincides with the decline of Gnyozdovo. The regional centre could have been moved from Gnyozdovo to Smolensk at some point following the [[Christianisation of Rus]] by [[Vladimir the Great]].<ref><U+0411><U+0443><U+043B><U+043A><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0412>.<U+0410>., <U+041B><U+0435><U+0431><U+0435><U+0434><U+0435><U+0432> <U+0413>.<U+0421>. <U+0413><U+043D><U+0435><U+0437><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0438> <U+0411><U+0438><U+0440><U+043A><U+0430> (<U+043A> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0431><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>).

Leningrad, 1974.</ref> 

Another school of thought is represented by Petrukhin and Pushkina who maintain that Smolensk and Gnyozdovo peacefully coexisted throughout the [[10th century]].<ref><U+0412>. <U+042F>. <U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+0443><U+0445><U+0438><U+043D>, <U+0422>. <U+0410>. <U+041F><U+0443><U+0448><U+043A><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>. <U+041A> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+044B><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>. // <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420>, <U+2116>4. Moscow-Leningrad, 1979. Pages 100-112.</ref> According to this version, Gnyozdovo was a [[pogost]] of the ruling [[Kiev]]an monarch which he used to levy tribute from the [[Krivichs]]. Since the [[knyaz]]'s [[druzhina]] was composed primarily of the Norsemen, a substantial Varangian presence at Gnyozdovo seems to be well motivated. Concurrently, Smolensk was an urban centre of the Slavic (Krivich) population, where the regional [[veche]] was held. After Vladimir the Great established a local principality for his son, the administrative centre of the region and the seat of princely power was moved from Gnyozdovo to Smyadyn Castle near Smolensk.<ref>This residence of the Smolensk princes is first recorded under year [[1015]] in the ''Life of Sts.&nbsp;[[Boris and Gleb]]'', attributed to [[Nestor the Chronicler]].</ref>

The [[dichotomy]] of a Slavic [[veche]] centre and a Varangian [[druzhina]] station has parallels in other areas of Rus: compare [[Novgorod]] and [[Holmsgard]], [[Chernigov]] and [[Shestovitsa]], [[Rostov]] and [[Sarskoye Gorodishche]], [[Yaroslavl]] and [[Timeryovo]]. In later centuries, the ruling princes from the [[House of Rurik]] preferred to settle in a fortified castle at a distance from their capital: in [[Vyshgorod]] rather than [[Kiev]], in Smyadyn rather than Smolensk, in [[Kideksha]] rather than [[Suzdal]], in [[Bogolyubovo]] rather than [[Vladimir]].

==Nomenclature==
The place-name Gnyozdovo seems to be a late medieval derivation from the Slavic word for "nest". It is first recorded in the 17th-century documents. Historians disagree as to what was the earlier name of the settlement. Those who view Gnyozdovo as the antecedent of Smolensk, believe that the name of Smolensk originally applied to Gnyozdovo. According to them, [[Constantine VII]] referred to the site of Gnyozdovo when he mentioned the fortress of Smolensk in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' records Smolensk even earlier, in connection with [[Askold and Dir]]'s raid against [[Kiev]] in [[867]]. 

[[Vasmer]] and other etymologists derive the name of Smolensk from the Smolnya River. If so, the original Slavic name for Gnyozdovo must have been different. Tatiana Jackson theorizes that it may have been derived from the name of the Svinets River, reconstructing it as '''Svinechsk''' (<U+0421><U+0432><U+0438><U+043D><U+0435><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+044A>). As the name of the river seems to be related to the Russian word for "swine" and ancient Gnyozdovo was situated on a promontory, Jackson identified this settlement with '''S<U+00FD>rnes''' ("swine promontory" in Old Norse), one of seven or eight cities of [[Gardariki]] listed in the Norse geographical treatise of ''[[Hauksb<U+00F3>k]]''.<ref><U+0414><U+0436><U+0430><U+043A><U+0441><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0422>.<U+041D>.
