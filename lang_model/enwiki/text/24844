==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
Businessman and philanthropist George A. Weiss founded Say Yes to Education, Inc. in 1987, initially making a promise to 112 [[sixth grade]]rs at Belmont Elementary School in [[Philadelphia]] that he would cover the expenses of their college tuition if they graduated from high school.<ref name=Penn>Barrientos, Tanya. [http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/features/030410-1.html "For George A. Weiss, giving is about fulfilling a pledge"], ''Penn Current'', March 4, 2010, accessed November 17, 2010.</ref> According to [[David Callahan]], Weiss was "directly inspired by [[Eugene Lang]], a philanthropist who made a similar promise to sixth-graders in [[Harlem, New York]] in 1981 and then set up the [[I Have a Dream Foundation|'I Have a Dream' Foundation]] to spread this promise to more students."<ref name=Callahn>Callahan, David.

==Chapters==
===Philadelphia, PA===
Say Yes began in 1987 with the creation of the Belmont Program of the Philadelphia Chapter.  The first students chosen to participate in the program were a group of 112 seventh grade students. Students in the Belmont Program received mentoring and tutoring services, and were provided with after-school and summer programs. Say Yes also focused on family outreach, offering social work and psychological services and administering free medical and dental care.<ref name=Belmont>[http://www.sayyestoeducation.org/syte/content/view/41/55/ "Belmont Program of the Philadelphia Chapter"], Say Yes to Education, accessed November 28, 2010.</ref>

===Hartford, CT===
In October 1990, the Hartford Chapter of Say Yes began when 76 fifth grade students at Annie Fisher Elementary School received a "promise of assistance with tuition costs at either the [[University of Hartford]] or other accredited post-secondary institutions."<ref name=Hartford>[http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/syte/history.htm "History of Say Yes to Education-Hartford Chapter"], University of Hartford, accessed November 28, 2010.</ref> This gift from Hartford University was linked with what is now known as the Hartford Scholars Program, which provides [[Hartford Public Schools|Hartford Public School]] graduates with half-tuition at the university. The goals of the Hartford Chapter were to encourage and motivate at-risk students to graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary education or training; to help students learn how to make constructive decisions for their lives; and to help students become responsible, productive adults.<ref name=Hartford/> The chapter provided a number of support programs to help students reach these goals, including after-school tutoring, individual student support services, educational summer opportunities, and recognition of student achievement; organizing overnight retreats focusing on growth and development issues such as human sexuality, respect and responsibility within relationships, and conflict resolution; monitoring the academic and personal progress of students; arranging college visits; and providing assistance to families and students with the admission process.<ref name=Hartford2>[http://www.sayyestoeducation.org/syte/content/view/26/32/ "Hartford Chapter"], Say Yes to Education, accessed November 28, 2010.</ref> The Hartford Chapter of Say Yes closed in June 2005.<ref name=Hartford/>

===Cambridge, MA===
The third Say Yes chapter was formed in June 1991 at the Harrington Elementary School in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The original Say Yes group for the Cambridge Chapter consisted of 69 students who were beginning [[third grade]] at Harrington. The chapter was supported by a partnership between [[Lesley University]] and the Cambridge Public School District, and with funding from eight local sponsors. Lesley University provided various resources such as tutoring, counseling, academic materials, and professional development help to Harrington. The Cambridge Chapter assisted the school in its restructuring efforts by "working closely with the Harrington administration and faculty to develop strategies for team teaching and grade level cluster development, interdisciplinary and thematic teaching, career weeks, portfolio assessment, and before- and after-school programs." <ref name=Cambridge>[http://www.sayyestoeducation.org/syte/content/view/25/32/ "Cambridge Chapter"], Say Yes to Education, accessed November 21, 2010.</ref>
