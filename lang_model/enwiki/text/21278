After being considered as a potential [[running mate|Vice Presidential candidate]] for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], former [[Governor of Iowa|Iowa Governor]] [[Tom Vilsack]] began a campaign for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. 

On November 30, 2006, he became the second Democratic candidate to officially announce a presidential run. His short-lived campaign was focused on his home state of [[Iowa]] but suffered low standing in national polls and a lack of name recognition. During the campaign, he emphasized the War in Iraq and his plan for ending it.

His run concluded on February 23, 2007, before any debates or primaries, due to funding shortfalls. He endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] after his exit, but shifted to [[Barack Obama]] after her withdrawal.

==Early stages==

Near the end of his eight years as Governor of Iowa, Vilsack, as head of the [[centrist]] Democratic Leadership Council, campaigned for Democratic gubernatorial candidates across the nation. While on the campaign trail he gauged support for a possible presidential run. Vilsack was inspired by the results of the [[United States general election, 2006|2006 mid-term elections]], and proclaimed that "Americans sent a clear message" that "they want leaders who share their values, understand their needs and respect their intelligence" and that that is what he would "intend to do as president". On November 9, Vilsack filed with the [[FEC]] and announced that he had been "put[ting] together the building blocks needed to run a successful national presidential campaign." He made his formal announcement on November 30.<ref> {{cite news |first=Mike |last=Glover |authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Iowa's Vilsack to Run for President |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgif=/n/a/2006/11/08/politics/p233155S48.DTL |work= |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2006-11-08|accessdate=2008-07-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}  </ref>

==Campaign developments==
Vilsack made his announcement in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa]]. He listed the themes of his campaign as energy independence, national security, and the economy. The candidate promised change in government by means of reduced partisanship and decried the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] as one "whose first impulse is to divide and to conquer." Vilsack acknowledged his underdog status, given his low profile outside Iowa, which hampered fundraising.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Glover |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack Enters 2008 White House Race|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2006/11/30/AR2006113000403.html  |work= |publisher=Washington Post |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}  </ref>

In December, Vilsack embarked on a campaign tour beginning in his hometown of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame [[alcoholism]]. He also discussed his policy on the [[Iraq War]], advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: "It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing to fight for it and they certainly should be willing to die for it." He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week.<ref> {{cite news |first=Ramesh |last=Santanam |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack's 5-State Tour Kicks Off '08 Run|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200689.html |work= |publisher=Washington Post |date=2006-12-02 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref>

In mid-December 2006 Vilsack was interviewed by two major magazines. In ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', he explained why he decided against forming an [[exploratory committee]] like many of his Democratic rivals, on the principle that he had "to get to work." He linked the issue of energy security to global warming and national security. He advocated moving American troops from southern and central Iraq to the north, and further commented that political reconciliation must be refocused on "building local governance" rather than spending "all the time on the national government."<ref> {{cite news |first=Will |last=Sullivan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Hawkeye Long Shot|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/061217/25vilsack.htm |work= |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |date=2006-12-17 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he made a distinction between "experience and judgment" and emphasized the importance of the latter. Vilsack attacked Republican candidate John McCain's planned Iraq troop surge as "making a big mistake bigger", and denied that the military had the resources to execute it. In discounting the importance of name recognition, he said "people don<U+2019>t have to remember my name, they only have to remember the first letter which is V. It stands for vision, it stands for victory, it stands for Vilsack." He also expressed his satisfaction with frontrunner Hillary Clinton, calling himself "a big fan."<ref>  {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=I<U+2019>m Tom Vilsack! Who the Hell Are You? |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/nationalaffairs/?p=874 |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2006-12-21 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }} </ref>

In January, Vilsack toured [[New Hampshire]], site of the first primary. There he met with middle school students, with whom he discussed his plans for rebuilding Iraq. Dismissing his Democratic opponents' calls for caps on American troops in the nation, Vilsack advocated a troop withdrawal. He also talked about Iraq with employees of the Granite State Independent Living Group, blaming the costs of rebuilding for the lack of public funds available for domestic projects.<ref> {{cite news |first=Holly |last=Ramer |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack Argues for Iraq Troop {{sic|With|drawl|nolink=1}} |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901108.html |work= |publisher=Washington Post |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref> In Iowa later in the month, Vilsack reiterated his opposition to troop caps, likening them to "staying the course". He stated that troop capping "reflects the continuation of a failed policy" and that America "ought to be...aggressively redeploying troops out of Iraq."<ref> {{cite news |first=Mike |last=Glover |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack Reiterates Troop Cap Opposition |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/26/AR2007012601231.html |work= |publisher=Washington Post |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref>

On February 15, before an appearance on the ''[[Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jay Leno]], Vilsack visited the [[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]] in [[San Francisco]] where he gave a speech about energy. He explained that his campaign remained [[carbon neutral]] through the purchase of [[carbon credits]].<ref> {{cite news |first=Stafford |last=Williamson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Danger in Too Distant Deadlines for Ethanol, Biobutanol, Biodiesel,Biomass and Alternative Energy |url=http://winfotech.com/energy/20931.htm |work= |publisher=DaoChi Energy of Arizona |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref> On the ''Tonight Show'', Vilsack joked about his relative obscurity. He remarked that he was okay with Leno making jokes about him, because  "when you are just below the margin of error in polls, anything anybody says about you is important."<ref> {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack's Tonight Show Appearance |url=http://wherearethecandidates.com/2007/02/vilsacks-tonight-show-appearance.html?widgetType=BlogArchive&widgetId=BlogArchive1&action=toggle&dir=close&toggle=YEARLY-1167638400000&toggleopen=WEEKLY-1171785600000 |work= |publisher=Associated Press |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref> 

Vilsack officially withdrew from the race on February 23, stating that the crowded field of Democratic candidates made it impossible for him to raise enough money to continue his campaign. In explaining his withdrawal, he stated that he "came up against something for the first time in [his] life that hard work and effort couldn<U+2019>t overcome." Bemoaning an electoral process that he saw as dominated by fundraising, he left the race proclaiming "it is money and only money that is the reason we are leaving today." Vilsack raised $1.1 million during his run and left the race with $396,000 on hand.<ref> {{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Zeleny |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack Withdraws From Presidential Race |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/us/politics/23cnd-vilsack.html?ex=1329886800&en=658c886755088472&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref>

==Polling==
In the race for the Democratic nomination, [[Gallup poll]]s placed Vilsack at 1% support in November and December 2006. This fell to 0% on January 7, where it remained until his withdrawal in February.<ref> {{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Jones |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Clinton, Giuliani Lengthen Leads in Presidential Nomination Trial Heats |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26518/Clinton-Giuliani-Lengthen-Leads-Presidential-Nomination-Trial-Heats.aspx |work= |publisher=Gallup |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }} </ref>

A [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen report]] published December 18, 2006 that polled voters on their preferences in a variety of hypothetical presidential matchups showed that Vilsack was preferred to former [[Arkansas]] [[Governor of Arkansas|governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]] by a margin of 37% to 29%, but trailed former [[New York City]] [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudy Guliani]] 56% to 28%."<ref> {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Giuliani 56%; Vilsack 28%|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_2008/other_election_2008/election_2008_presidential_match_ups2  |work= |publisher=Rasmussen Reports |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }} </ref> A similar poll, published in February 2007 before Vilsack's withdrawal, found that he trailed Republican Senator John McCain 50% to 22%. In a separate poll by Rasmussen, Vilsack was viewed favorably by 21% of the electorate and unfavorably by 21%. 58% of voters did not have enough information about Vilsack to have an opinion. 19% of respondents considered Vilsack a moderate, 9% considered him a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and 7% considered him a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]. 65% could not describe his political stands.<ref> {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Vilsack Losing Ground, Withdraws from Presidential Race |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/vilsack_losing_ground_withdraws_from_presidential_race  |work= |publisher=Rasmussen Reports |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} </ref>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Tom Vilsack stumps for Hillary Clinton.jpg|thumb|Vilsack campaigns for [[Hillary Clinton]] in January 2008]]
After withdrawing from the race, Vilsack endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for the presidency on March 25, 2007. He hoped to build momentum for her in Iowa. The former Governor identified Clinton as the candidate with "the best ideas, the most energy, and the values and vision to lead our country." Shortly after the endorsement, Clinton named Vilsack's wife Christie as the co-chairman of her campaign in Iowa.<ref> {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Clinton Gains Endorsement from Vilsack |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,260688,00.html |work= |publisher=Fox News |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2008-07-22 }}  </ref> The Clinton campaign announced they would help Vilsack pay off his campaign's $400,000 debt.<ref> {{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Sen.
