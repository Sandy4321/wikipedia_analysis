'''Video game music''' is any of the musical pieces or [[soundtrack]]s found in [[video game]]s.

==History==
===Early video game technology and computer chip music===
<!---{{multi-listen item|filename=Super Mario Bros. - Original Theme.ogg|title=Audio sample|description=''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985) for the NES is widely known for its music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}--->
At the time [[video games]] began to emerge as a form of entertainment in the 1970s (known as the [[History of video game consoles (first generation)|first generation]]), [[music]] was stored on physical medium in analog waveforms such as [[compact cassette]]s and [[phonograph record]]s. Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use in an [[arcade cabinet]], though in rare cases, they were used (''[[Journey (arcade game)|Journey]]''). A more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means, where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves [[on the fly]] for output on a speaker. Sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion.

While this allowed for inclusion of music of arcade games in the 1970s, it was usually monophonic, looped, or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game, such as ''[[Pac Man]]'', or ''[[Pole Position]]''. The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code by a programmer, whether or not the programmer had musical experience. Some music was original, some was [[public domain]] music such as folk songs. The popular [[Atari 2600]] home system, for example, was capable of generating only two tones, or "notes," at a time. Some exceptions, such as arcade games developed by [[Exidy]], took steps toward digitized, or '[[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]]' sounds.

This approach in game development carried on into the 1980s. As advances in silicon and cost of technology fell, a definitively new generation of arcade machines and [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|home consoles]] allowed for great changes in accompanying music. In arcades, machines based on the Motorola [[68000]] CPU and Yamaha YM chips for sound generators allowed for several more tones or 'channels' of sound, sometimes eight or more. Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the [[ColecoVision]] in 1982 capable of four channels. However, more notable was the Japanese release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1983 which would later be known in the US as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] in 1985. It was capable of a total of 5 channels, one being capable of simple [[PCM]] sampled sound. Also of note was the home computer [[Commodore 64]] released in 1982, which was capable of early forms of filtering effects, different types of [[waveform]]s and eventually the ability to play 4 bit samples on a 4th sound channel. Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers, as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor.

Approach to game music development in this time period usually involved using simple tone generation and/or [[frequency modulation synthesis]] to simulate instruments for melodies, and use of a 'noise channel' for simulating percussive noises. Early use of PCM samples in this era was limited to sound bites (''Monopoly''), or as an alternate for percussion sounds (''[[Super Mario Bros 3]]''). The music on home consoles often had to share the available channels with other sound effects. For example, if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship, and the laser used a 1400 Hz tone, then whichever channel was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect.

The mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before. Quality of composition improved noticeably, and evidence of the popularity of music of this time period remains even today. Composers who made a name for themselves with their software include [[Koji Kondo]] (''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''), [[Koichi Sugiyama]]<ref>[http://sugimania.com/ Koichi Sugiyama Home Page]</ref> (''[[Dragon Quest]]''), [[Rob Hubbard]] (''[[Monty On the Run]]''), [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] (''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Kid Icarus]]''), [[Martin Galway]] (''[[Times of Lore]]''), Hiroshi Miyauchi (''[[Out Run]]''), [[Nobuo Uematsu]] (''[[Final Fantasy]]''), and [[Yuzo Koshiro]] (''[[Ys (video game)|Ys]]''). Toward the end of the life of the Famicom, some cartridge games were custom manufactured with additional tone generating chips built into them at the developer's expense, further expanding to the number of channels for composition.

The oncoming generation of arcade, home consoles, and home computers would reshape the approach to music in video games.

===Early digital synthesis and sampling===
The first home computer to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the [[Commodore Amiga]] in 1985. The computer's sound chip featured four independent 8-bit [[digital-to-analog converter]]s. Instead of simply generating a [[waveform]] that sounded like a simplistic "[[beep (sound)|beep]]", such as [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]], this technique allowed short [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] of pre-recorded sound waves to be played back through the computer's [[sound chip]] from memory.  It allowed a developer to take a 'sample' of a real instrument or sound they wanted at a significantly higher quality and fidelity than was previously available or would come to be available on home computing for several years. This was an early development example of what would later be called [[wavetable]]s and [[soundfont]]s. For its role in being first and affordable, the Amiga would remain a staple tool of early [[music sequencer|sequenced]] music composing, especially in [[Europe]].

The Amiga's main rival, the [[Atari ST]], used the [[Yamaha YM2149]] [[Programmable Sound Generator]] (PSG), which was limited compared to the Commodore 64's SID chip and thus digitized sound was heard on Atari ST only through certain programming tricks that consumed processor time making it impractical for games. Since it had in-built [[MIDI]] ports, the Atari ST was instead used by many professional musicians as a MIDI programming device.

[[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC clones]] in 1985 would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years, and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years. Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds, each sample required much more data in [[Memory (computers)|memory]]. This was at a time when all memory, solid state ([[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]), magnetic ([[floppy disk]]) or otherwise was still very costly per [[kilobyte]]. Sequenced soundchip generated music on the other hand was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory.

The previously mentioned hybrid approach (sampled and tone) to music composing in the Third Generation of consoles would continue into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|Fourth Generation]], or 16-bit era, of home game consoles with the [[Sega Mega Drive]] in 1988. The Mega Drive, (Sega Genesis in the US) offered advanced graphics over the NES and improved sound synthesis, but largely held the same approach to sound design. Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in [[stereo]] instead of the NES's five channels in mono, one for PCM. As before, it would often be used for percussion samples, or 'drum kits' (''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]''). It should be pointed out that the 16-bit Sega referred to was the CPU and should not be confused with 16-bit sound samples. The Genesis did not support 16-bit sampled sounds. Despite the additional tone channels, writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] synthesizer to create an enjoyable listening experience.

As cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes, the evolution of video game music on the Amiga, and some years later game music development in general, shifted to sampling in some form. It took some years before Amiga game designers learned to wholly utilize digitized sound effects in music (an early exception case was the title music of [[interactive fiction|text adventure]] game ''[[The Pawn]]'', 1986). Also, by this time computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity, and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the [[Commodore 64]], which resulted in the [[chiptune]] genre.

The release of a freely-distributed Amiga program named ''Sound Tracker'' by [[Karsten Obarski]] in 1987 started the era of [[MOD (file format)|MOD]]-format which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples. [[MOD (file format)|MOD]]-files were made with programs called "[[tracker]]s" after Obarski's ''Sound Tracker''. This MOD/tracker tradition continued with PC computers in 1990s. Good examples of [[Amiga games]] using digitized instrument samples include [[David Whittaker]]'s soundtrack for ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', [[Chris H<U+00FC>lsbeck]]'s soundtrack for ''[[Turrican|Turrican 2]]'' and [[Matt Furniss]]'s tunes for ''[[Laser Squad]]''. [[Richard Joseph]] also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by [[Sensible Software]] most famous being ''[[Cannon Fodder]]'' (1993) with a song "War Has Never Been So Much Fun" and ''[[Sensible Soccer|Sensible World of Soccer]]'' (1994) with a song "Goal Scoring Superstar Hero". These songs used long vocal samples.

Similar to the Amiga, this approach to sound and music developments in arcades began to appear in certain specialized [[arcade system board]] revisions. In 1991, games like ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' on the [[CPS-1]] used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion. [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]]'s MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included [[surround sound]].

[[Image:Super  Nintendo Entertainment System-USA.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] (1990) brought digitized sound to console games.]]

The evolution also carried into home console video games, most notably with the release of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1990, and its US/EU version SNES in 1991. This home console system sported a specialized custom [[Sony]] chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP. It was capable of 8 channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, possessed a wide selection of DSP effects including a type of [[ADSR]] seen usually in high end synthesizers of the time period, and full stereo sound. This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like ''[[Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', ''[[Gradius III]]'', and later games ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''), directional (''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]'') and spatial acoustics ([[Dolby Pro-Logic]] was used in some games, like ''King Arthur's World'' and ''Jurassic Park''), as well as environmental and [[architectural acoustics]] (''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|Zelda III]]'', ''[[Secret of Evermore]]''). Many games also made heavy use of the high quality sample playback capabilities (''[[Super Star Wars]]'', ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]''). The only real limitation to this powerful setup was the still costly [[Semiconductor memory|solid state memory]].

Other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet didn't enjoy the same popularity as the SNES. The [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] home system was capable of powerful sample processing, but was several times the cost of a SNES. The [[Sega CD]] upgrade to the Genesis added multiple PCM channels, but few titles used this feature and instead simply streamed music from the CD from a [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] format. Neither saw the circulation of the SNES.

Popularity of the SNES and its software remained limited to regions where [[NTSC]] television was the broadcast standard. Partly because of the difference in frame rates of [[PAL]] broadcast equipment, many titles released were never re-designed to play appropriately and ran much slower than originally intended, or were simply never released. This represented a divergence in popular video game music between PAL and NTSC countries that still shows to this day. This divergence would be lessened as the Fifth Generation of home consoles launched globally, and as Commodore began to take a backseat to general purpose PCs and Macs.

Though the Sega-CD, and to a greater extent the [[PC Engine]] in Japan, would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in [[streaming media|streaming]] music, the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today. The huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|Fifth Generation]]. In 1994, the [[PlayStation]] with a CD-ROM drive supported 24 channels of 16-bit samples of up to 44.1 kHz sample rate, equal to CD audio quality. It also sported a few hardware DSP effects like [[reverb]]. Many [[Squaresoft]] titles continued to use sequenced music, such as ''[[Final Fantasy 7]]'', ''[[Legend of Mana]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''. The [[Sega Saturn]] also with a CD drive supported 32 channels of PCM at the same resolution as the PSX. In 1996 the [[N64]], still using a solid state cartridge, actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of PCM, and an improved sample rate of 48 kHz. Games for the N64, because of the cost of the solid state memory, typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two however, and music tended to be simpler in construct.

The more dominant approach for games based on CDs, however, was shifting toward [[streaming media|streaming]] audio.

===MIDI on the PC===

[[Image:IBM PC 5150.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The first developers of [[IBM PC]] computers neglected audio capabilities (first IBM model, 1981).]]
In the same timeframe of late 1980s to mid 1990s, the IBM PC platform followed a different path from other computers. Early PC gaming was limited to the 1-bit [[PC speaker]], and a smattering of proprietary standards such as the [[IBM PCjr]] 3-voice chip. While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker, using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare. 

The resulting vacuum in useful sound performance, coupled with increasing interest in game software as PC clones began to dominate the market, resulted in competition among add-on card sellers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first two recognizable standards were the [[Roland]] [[MT-32]], followed by the [[AdLib]] sound card. Both such examples were typically listed in the game's requirements of the era.  Roland's solution was driven by [[MIDI]] sequencing using advanced LA synthesizers, and cost significantly more than other products. This made it the first choice for game ''developers'', but placed it out of the common consumer's view. The AdLib used a low-cost FM synthesis chip from Yamaha, and was quite affordable. 

The [[AdLib]] card was usurped in 1989 by [[Creative Technology|Creative]]'s [[Sound Blaster]], which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib, ensuring 100% compatibility, but also added 8-bit 22.05 kHz (later 44.1 kHz) digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel. The Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s, a combination of a simple FM engine that supported midi, and a DAC engine of one or more streams. Only a minority of developers ever used Amiga-style tracker formats in commercial PC games, (''[[Unreal]]'') typically preferring to use the MT-32 or AdLib/SB-compatible devices. 

The last major development before streaming music came in 1992: [[Roland]] released the first [[General MIDI]] card, the [[wavetable]] [[SCC-1]], and General MIDI with wavetable samples quickly usurped AdLib as the standard. Developers increasingly made a compromise in light of the variety of hardware around by then, and the increasing use of General MIDI: instead of writing one sequence for each supported sound device, to use [[MIDI]] sequencing as a common music standard, with sampled sound effects. (''[[Doom]]'') This allowed a large variety of cards to be supported from the same data(usually a sequence written for SB or MT-32). However, different products used different sound samples, and further, the samples were mixed at different relative volumes, meaning that no single sequence would be accurate on every other General Midi device. 

All of these designs and work-arounds in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapdily declined with the optical CD format.

===Pre-recorded and streaming music===
{{main|Streaming audio in video games}}
Taking entirely pre-recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality. Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments, allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game. Quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself. Memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games. [[CD quality]] audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music. 

In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a Red Book audio track from a CD while the game was in play (Sonic CD). However, there were several disadvantages of regular CD-audio. Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed, so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system couldn't access data again until it stopped the track from playing. [[Looping]], the most common form of game music, was also problem as when the laser reached the end of a track, it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback.

To address these drawbacks, some PC game developers designed their own container formats in house, for each application in some cases, to stream compressed audio. This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD, allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music, and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]] the data. A minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the CPU of a system. As computing power increased, this load became minimal, and in some cases dedicated chips in a computer (such as a sound card) would actually handle all the decompressing. 

Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback. Sony would call theirs [[Yellow Book (CD standard)|Yellow Book]], and offer the standard to other companies. Games would take full advantage of this ability, sometimes with highly praised results (''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''). Games ported from arcade machines, which continued to use FM synthesis, often saw superior pre-recorded music streams on their home console counterparts (''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]''). Even though the game systems were capable of "CD quality" sound, these compressed audio tracks were not true "CD quality." Many of them had lower sampling rates, but not so significant that most consumers would notice. Some games continued to use full redbook CD audio for their soundtracks ([[Wipeout (video game series)|the ''Wipeout'' series]]) and could even be played in a standard CD player.

This overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked. A musician could now, with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself, independently produce the music to their satisfaction. This flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically.   An early example would be ''Way of the Warrior'' on the [[3DO]], with music by [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. A more well-known example would be [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''Quake''. 

An alternate approach, as with the ''TMNT'' arcade, was to take pre-existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game. The game ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter]]'' and subsequent ''Star Wars'' games took music composed by [[John Williams]] for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies of the 1970s and 1980s and used it for the game soundtracks. 

Both using new music streams made specifically for the game, and using previously released/recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day. It is common for X-games sports based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (SSX, Tony Hawk, Initial D), as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (''[[Need For Speed: Underground]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.

Sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming for many applications, mostly RPGs. Sometimes a cross between sequencing samples, and streaming music is used. Games such as ''[[Republic: The Revolution]]'' (music composed by James Hannigan<ref>[http://www.jameshannigan.com/ Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) and ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals]]'' (music composed by Bill Brown) have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the player's most recent choices. Other games would dynamically mix the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment. In a recent game, if your snowboarder in ''[[SSX]]'' took to the air after jumping from a ramp, the music would soften or even muffle a bit, and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing would become louder to emphasize the sensation of being airborne. When you land, the music would resume regular playback until its next 'cue'. The [[LucasArts]] company pioneered this interactive music technique with their [[iMUSE]] system, used in their early adventure games and the ''Star Wars'' flight simulators ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]''. Action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger. Stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music.

===Personalized soundtracks===
Being able to play one's own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternate music player. Some early exceptions were possible on PC/Windows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background. Some PC games, for example [[Quake]], played music from the CD while retriving game data exclusively from the hard disk, thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD.

Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD, although when the game needed data, you had to swap the CDs again. One of the earliest games, ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'', was loaded entirely into RAM, letting the player insert a music CD to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay. In ''[[Vib Ribbon]]'', this became a gameplay feature, with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever CD the player inserted.

Microsoft's [[Xbox]], a competitor in the sixth generation of home consoles opened new possibilities. Its ability to copy music from a CD onto its internal hard drive allowed gamers to utilize their own music more seamlessly with gameplay than ever before. The feature, called Custom Soundtrack, had to be enabled by the game developer. The feature carried over into the seventh generation with the [[Xbox 360]] except it is now supported by the system software and enabled at any point.

The [[Wii]] is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game (Excite Truck<ref>[http://wiiportal.nintendo-europe.com/9174.html Nintendo Wii: Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, Endless Ocean<ref>[http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/wii/endless_ocean_2825.html Nintendo - Games - Endless Ocean<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>).

The [[PlayStation Portable]] can, in games like [[Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City]] and [[FIFA 08]] also let the player play their own music from a [[Memory Stick]].

The [[PlayStation 3]] has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive, however few game developers have used this function so far. MLB 08: The Show, released in North America on [[March 4]] [[2008]], has a My MLB sound track feature which allows the user to play music tracks of the users choice saved on the hard drive of his/her PS3, rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer. An update to [[Super Stardust HD]], released on the PlayStation Network, was made to also incorporate this feature.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

In ''[[Audiosurf]]'', custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game. Users have to pick a music file to be analyzed. The game will generate a race track based on tempo, pitch and complexity of the sound. The user will then race on this track, synchronized with the music.

===Current application and future developments===
The Xbox 360 wields software [[Dolby Digital]] support, sampling and playback rate of 16-bit @ 48 kHz (internal; with 24-bit hardware D/A converters), hardware codec streaming, and potential of 256 audio simultaneous channels. While powerful and flexible, none of these features represent any major change in how game music is made from the last generation of console systems. PCs continue to rely on third-party devices for in-game sound reproduction, and SoundBlaster, despite being largely the only major player in the entertainment audio expansion card business, continues to advance its product development at a significant pace.

The PlayStation 3 handles multiple types of surround sound technology, including [[Dolby TrueHD]], and [[DTS-HD]]. 

Nintendo's [[Wii]] console shares many audio components with the [[Nintendo GameCube]] from the previous generation, including [[Dolby Pro Logic II]]. These features are extensions of technology already currently in use.

The game developer of today has many choices on how to develop music. More likely, changes in video game music creation will have very little to do with technology and more to do with other factors of game development as a business whole. As sales of video game music separate from the game itself became marketable in the west (compared to Japan where game music CDs had been selling for years), business elements also wield a level of influence that it had little before. Music from outside the game developer's immediate employment, such as music composers and pop artists, have been contracted to produce game music just as they would for a theatrical movie. Many other factors have growing influence, such as editing for content, politics on some level of the development, executive input and other elements.

==Game music as a genre==
Many of the games made for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game systems featured a similar style of music which may come closest to being described as the "video game genre" in terms of musical composition, as opposed to simply "video game music" for being in a video game or being played on a video game console. Some compositional features of this genre continue to influence certain music today, though, game soundtracks currently tend to emulate movie soundtracks more-so than this classic genre. This genre's compositional elements may have developed due to technological restraints. The genre might also have been influenced by technopop bands such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], which were quite popular during the period in which videogame music took its trademark sound. Features of this genre include:
*Songs almost always have main sections or "verse sections" consisting of [[chord progressions]] of four or more chords (similar to much of [[J-Pop]] and 1980s Western Pop), as opposed to the two chord progressions found in most Western Pop verses. The "chorus" of the songs also often contain four or more different chords in their chord progressions. Often many songs feature a chord progression which is extremely popular in J-Pop, which (in the key of C) could be given as: F minor, C minor, G major, C minor, with C major quickly inserted before the series repeats again. <!-- Has a whole genre of music this progression? --> Overall, there would be generally a higher number of sections of a song than a comparable pop song, as this helps to reduce the repetitive aspect of the music, which was generally played as a continuous loop. This also sets it apart from even J-Pop music or most other forms of popular music. 
*Songs feature a heavy amount of synchronization between instruments, in a way that would be difficult for a human to play. For example, although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise channel used for drums), and although video game music was influenced by rock or pop music at the time, composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes. That has been compared to music composition during the [[baroque]] period, where it is believed that composers compensated for instruments such as the [[harpsichord]] (which do not allow for musical expression based on the volume of the sound) by focusing more on musical embellishments. Composers were also limited in terms of polyphony, or the number of notes that can be played at once. Only three notes can be played at once on the Nintendo Entertainment System. A great deal of effort was put into creating the illusion that more notes are playing. As of the late 1990s, musical groups covering these melodies have sprung up. One such group is [[The Advantage]], who attempt to emulate these melodies as closely as possible using real instruments. Another such group is [[The NESkimos]], who opt to explore these songs artistically, and create entirely new songs out of them. See also [[MegaDriver]].
*The bassline of a large percentage of tunes during the 8-bit period consisted of notes played in the rhythm of a quarter note followed immediately by two eighth notes on most beats. The particular note played would often be the root of the chord.

==Video game music outside of video games==
Appreciation for video game music, particularly music from the [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|third]] & [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth]] generations of home video game console and sometimes newer generations, continues today in very strong representation in both fans and composers alike, even out of the context of a video game. Melodies and themes from 20 years ago continue to be re-used in newer generations of video games. Themes from the original [[Metroid]] by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] can still be heard in Metroid games from today as arranged by [[Kenji Yamamoto]].

Video game music soundtracks were sold separately on CD in Japan well before the practice spread to other countries.  Interpretive albums, re-mixes, and live performances were also common variations to original soundtracks (abbreviated OST). [[Koichi Sugiyama]] was an early figure in this practice sub-genres, and following the release of the first [[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]] game in 1986, a live performance CD of his compositions was released and performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (then later by other groups including the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[NHK Symphony]]). [[Yuzo Koshiro]], another early figure, released a live performance of the [[Actraiser]] soundtrack. Both Koshiro's and fellow [[Falcom]] composer [[Mieko Ishikawa]]'s contributions to [[Ys (video game)|Ys]] music would have such long lasting impact that there were more albums released of Ys music than of almost all other game-type music.

Like [[anime]] soundtracks, these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in Japan. Therefore, interested non-Japanese gamers have to import the soundtracks and/or sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports. This has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the OSTs for sale in UK and US, but only for the most popular titles in most cases.

Composed and Conducted by [[Koichi Sugiyama]], Dragon Quest Suites I&II were performed.]]
Other original composers of the lasting themes from this time have gone on to manage symphonic concert performances to the public exhibiting their work in the games. Koichi Sugiyama was once again the first in this practice in 1987 with his "Family Classic Concert" and has continued concert performances almost annually. In 1991 he also formed a series called Orchestral Game Concerts, notable for featuring other talented game composers such as Yoko Kanno (Nobunaga's Ambition, Romance of the 3 Kingdoms, Uncharted Waters), Nobuo Uematsu (Final Fantasy), Keiichi Suzuki (Mother /Earthbound), and Kentaro Haneda (Wizardry).

Global popularity of video game music would begin to surge with Squaresoft's 1990s successes, particularly, ''Chrono Trigger'', ''Final Fantasy VI'', and ''Final Fantasy VII''. Compositions by Nobuo Uematsu on Final Fantasy 4 were arranged into Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon, a live performance by string musicians with strong celtic influence recorded in Ireland. The Love Theme from the same game has been used as an instructional piece of music in Japanese schools.
