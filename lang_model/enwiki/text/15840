'''Massey College''' is an elite interdisciplinary graduate [[residential college]] affiliated with, but independent from, the [[University of Toronto]]. It has a strong connection to the Canadian and Toronto establishments. It is nationally known in Canada for the annual [[Massey Lectures]] which it sponsors.

==History==

Founded by the [[Massey Foundation]] and opened in [[1963]], the college was designed by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[architect]] [[Ron Thom]]. 

The founding Master of Massey College was the celebrated Canadian journalist and author [[Robertson Davies]].  The fourth and current Master is the distinguished journalist [[John Fraser (journalist)|John Fraser]]. 

Amongst its many famous academic and non-academic Senior Fellows are: Nobel-laureate [[John Polanyi]], [[Ursula Franklin]], [[Stephen Lewis]], [[Margaret Atwood]],  Sir [[Christopher Ondaatje]] (the college's most significant private benefactor), [[Mark Kingwell]], [[James Orbinski]], [[Janice Stein]], and [[Bob Rae]]. The chancellors of both the University of Cambridge (H.R.H. The [[Prince Philip]], Duke of Edinburgh) and Oxford University (the Rt. Hon. the [[Lord Patten of Barnes]]) are both Distinguished Honorary Fellows. 

During the 2006-2007 academic year, the College hosted the King and Queen of Sweden, held a special tribute in honour of its Founding Master, Robertson Davies, and was the host of the  [[Man Booker International Prize]] in April 2007.<ref name="U of Toronto 2006">http://www.news.utoronto.ca/inthenews/archive/2006_06_17.html</ref>

==Description== 

Massey College is an academic home for 60 of the University of Toronto's graduate and professional students, called Resident Junior Fellows, and another 60 to 70 non-resident Junior Fellows.  Resident junior fellows can live in college for up to three years, and then become non-resident junior fellows for a further two years. In addition, the College hosts visiting academics, generally on sabbatical leave, who are called Senior Residents. 

The College has a strong connection to the Canadian and Toronto establishments, and Canadian journalism. Two of its Senior Fellows have been appointed governor general ([[Vincent Massey]] and [[Adrienne Clarkson]]). The college also strives to preserve an [[Oxbridge]]-type atmosphere by mandating the wearing of gowns at dinner, and incorporating regular High Tables &mdash; complete with after-dinner snuff &mdash; into its schedule; and balances this with very active outreach programs. The mandated goal of the college is to demonstrate through its corporate life the interconnectness between all learning. The College has been referred to as the [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] of Canada.<ref name="U of Toronto 2006">http://www.news.utoronto.ca/inthenews/archive/2006_06_17.html</ref>

The Canadian Journalism Fellowship Program (formerly known as the Southam Fellows) and the Scholar-at-Risk academic support program for international scholars caught out by sectarian, political or religious intolerance are two programs associated with Massey College.

Massey College sponsors the annual [[Massey Lectures]] as well as the Walter Gordon Symposium on Public Policy. In conjunction with the University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies, Massey fellows organise an annual symposium of interest to the broader community.  There is an annual newsletter to all its constituent members: Senior and Junior Fellows, Alumni (which include former Senior Residents like [[Preston Manning]]), and  members of its Quadrangle Society (non-academic community members). 

Massey is home to an [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] worship space, St. Catherine's Chapel, the interior of which was originally designed by stage designer [[Tanya Moiseiwitsch]]. The Chapel features an 18th-century Russian [[iconostasis]] and a baroque-style pipe organ. The chapel was extensively redesigned in 2006 by the College architects, Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe and rededicated in June 2007.

==Governance and finances==

Legally, Massey College is a [[registered charity]] named "Master and Fellows of Massey College". It is registered as such with the [[Canada Revenue Agency]], Charities Directorate.

The governing body of Massey College is its Corporation, of which the Master is Chair. The Corporation comprises 26 Senior Fellows which includes the President of the University of Toronto and the dean of graduate studies, who both sit as ex-officio members. Three other ex-officio Senior Fellows are nominated by the Massey Foundation. Officers of the College, who report to the Master, include the Bursar, the Registrar, the Administrator  and the Librarian. Both junior and senior fellows are elected to their positions by members of the Corporation at one of its semi-annual meetings. After long and meritorious service to the college, certain senior fellows and officers can be elected Continuing Senior Fellows which are lifetime appointments.
