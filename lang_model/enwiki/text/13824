''Empire Drum'' departed from Sunderland on 13 March for the [[River Tyne|Tyne]]. She made her [[maiden voyage]] on 15 March as a member of Convoy FN 655,<ref name=Port>{{cite web |url=http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=EMPIRE%20DRUM~armain |title=EMPIRE DRUM |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> which had departed from [[Southend-on-Sea|Southend]], [[Essex]] the previous day and arrived at [[Methil]], [[Fife]] on 16 March.<ref name=FN655>{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/fn/index.html?fn.php?convoy=0655!~fnmain |title=Convoy FN.55 / Phase 7 |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> The ship was in ballast.

''Empire Drum'' returned to Methil with defects.<ref name=EN60>{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/en/index.html?en.php?convoy=60!~enmain |title=Convoy EN.60 (Series 2) |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> Defects rectified, she joined Convoy EN 61, which departed on 20 March and arrived at Oban two days later.<ref name=EN61>{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/en/index.html?en.php?convoy=61!~enmain |title=Convoy EN.61 (Series 2) |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> She then sailed to [[Loch Ewe]]. ''Empire Drum'' then sailed to [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]] to join Convoy ON 79,<ref name=Port/> which departed on 23 March and arrived at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada on 7 April. Her destination was [[New York City|New York]], [[United States]],<ref name=ON79>{{cite web |url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/on/index.html?onz.php?convoy=79!~onzmain |title=Convoy ON.79 |publisher=Convoyweb |accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> where she arrived on 7 April.<ref name=Port/>

''Empire Drum'' was loaded with a cargo of {{convert|6000|LT|t}} of military stores, including a quantity of tyres and {{convert|1270|LT|t}} of explosives. She departed from New York on 23 April bound for [[Alexandria]], Egypt via [[Cape Town]], South Africa. At 23:48 (German time) on 24 April, {{GS|U-136|1941|2}}, under the command of Heinrich Zimmerman, fired two [[torpedo]]es at ''Empire Druid'', which was then {{convert|280|nmi|km}} south east of New York ({{coord|37|00|N|69|15|W|display=inline, title}}). One of them hit in her No. 1 hold on the port side, causing the ship to sink by the bow. All 35 crew and six [[DEMS]] gunners abandoned ship and took to the four [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] due to the nature of her cargo. At 00:08 on 25 April, ''U-136'' fired a ''coup de gr<U+00E2>ce'' which hit amidships on the port side. ''Empire Drum'' quickly sank but the explosion wrecked one lifeboat, throwing its four occupants into the sea. They were rescued by one of the other lifeboats. ''U-136'' surfaced and the survivors on board one of the lifeboats were questioned before the submarine left the scene.<ref name=Uboat/>

The sea conditions were slight, with a good breeze blowing. At daybreak 
the lifeboats headed west. One lifeboat, containing the captain and 13 crew was spotted by the Swedish merchant ship {{MV|Venezia||2}} on 26 April. The survivors were landed at New York the next day. The survivors on board second lifeboat, containg the chief officer and 13 crew were rescued by {{USS|Roper|DD-147|6}} on 29 April, having been spotted at {{coord|37|47|N|71|28|W}} by an aircraft. The survivors on board the third lifeboat were rescued by USS ''Roper'' on 1 May. They were just {{convert|15|nmi|km}} off the coast of the United States, having sailed for {{convert|265|nmi|km}}. Those rescued by USS ''Roper'' were landed at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 1 May.<ref name=Uboat/>
