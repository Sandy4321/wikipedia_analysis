'''''Tomb of Horrors''''' is a 1978 [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventure module]] for the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], written by [[Gary Gygax]].  It was originally written for and used at the 1975 [[Origins Game Fair|Origins 1]] convention.  Numbered "S1," the module was the first in the "S" (for "special series")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp|title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ|date=2003|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}</ref> series of modules.  Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978 and the most recent, published online, in 2005.  It also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.

The module's plot revolves around the tomb of the [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|demi-lich]] [[Acererak]].  The players' [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|characters]] must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak.  ''Tomb of Horrors'' is considered one of the greatest ''Dungeons & Dragons'' modules of all time, as well as one of the most difficult.  The module has influenced later ''Dungeons & Dragons'' products, and was followed by three other modules in the "S" series: ''[[White Plume Mountain|S2: White Plume Mountain]]'', ''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks|S3: Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'' and ''[[Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth|S4: Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth]]''.

==Plot summary==
''Tomb of Horrors'' is set in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'', a [[Campaign setting (Dungeons & Dragons)|campaign setting]] for ''Dungeons & Dragons''.<ref name="30Years">{{cite book| last=Stark| first=Ed| year= 2004| chapter=Greyhawk| coauthors=''et al.''| title=[[30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons]]| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| isbn =0-7869-3498-0 |page=57}}</ref> In ''Tomb of Horrors'', the players are told that the evil wizard [[Acererak]] is said to linger in his ancient tomb in [[Undead (Dungeons & Dragons)|undead]] form. Once a powerful [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]], he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. [[Player character]]s must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demilich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.

The module is divided into 33 encounters, beginning with two false entrances to the tomb, and ending with "The Crypt of Acererak the Demi-Lich".  Example encounters are the "Huge Pit Filled with 200 Spikes" (section 20), or encounter 22, "The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists": "The mists are silvery and shot through with delicate streamers of golden color. Vision extends only 6'. There is a dim aura of good if detected for. Those who step into the mist must save versus poison or become idiots until they can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun."<ref>{{cite book| last =Gygax| first =Gary| authorlink =Gary Gygax| title =Tomb of Horrors| publisher =[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| date =1978|isbn=0-935696-12-1 |pages=7}}</ref>  The module ends with the destruction of Acererak, without any postscript.

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote=This is a D&D adventure created in 1978 for the purposes of testing the wit and fortitude of adventuring parties at game tournaments.

''Tomb of Horrors'' was ranked the 3rd greatest ''Dungeons & Dragons'' adventure of all time by ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mona| first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Mona|coauthors=[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]]|title=The 30 Greatest D&D Adventures of All Time|journal=[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]] |volume=116 |year=2004|month=November|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing]]}}</ref>  ''Dungeon Master for Dummies'', which lists ''Tomb of Horrors'' as one of the ten best classic adventures, posits that many of the adventure's traps would kill a character just for making poor choices.<ref name="Dummies"/>

[[Don Turnbull]] reviewed ''Tomb of Horrors'' in issue #13 of the magazine ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' (December 1978/January 1979), and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull commented on the adventure's difficulty, noting that the dungeon is "sprinkled extensively with subtle, insidious and carefully-laid traps, and it will be a fortunate adventurer who manages to avoid them".<ref name="WD13"/> Turnbull felt that the illustration booklet would add a great deal to the adventure's atmosphere and felt that the pre-generated character roster was useful. Turnbull felt that the module is "very hard and will be hard for the DM to learn in advance, though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules", and he said that this module has in common with those modules an "excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced. TSR's high quality has not been in any way compromised, and in S1 it has even been improved upon."<ref name="WD13">{{cite journal | last =Turnbull | first =Don | title =Open Box: Dungeon Module Review | format = review  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 13 | pages =16<U+2013>17 | publisher =[[Games Workshop]] | year = 1979 | month = June/July}}</ref>

Wayne MacLaurin of [[SF Site]] describes the module as "a classic" and a "must have" for gamers, saying that when he played the game in high-school, most of his group's characters quickly died.  MacLaurin explains that ''Tomb of Horrors'' is a classic not because of its difficulty, but because it was the first module that did not involve killing large amounts of monsters; it was a "collection of puzzles and maps."  Its focus on traps rather than monsters was a surprise to gamers at the time.<ref name="sfsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/03b/ret53.htm|title=Return to the Tomb of Horrors|last=MacLaurin|first=Wayne|date=1999|publisher=[[SF Site]]|accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref>  One technique some players used to get past the deathtraps was to drive cattle ahead of them, which [[Lore Sj<U+00F6>berg]] of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described as "a bit less than heroic", noting that in ''Lord of the Rings'' Gandalf did not send "50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait."<ref name="Wired">{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/alttext/2008/03/alttext_0312|title=What Real-Life Dungeon Exploration Might Look Like, Graduate Students in Tow|last=Sj<U+00F6>berg|first=Lore|authorlink=Lore Sj<U+00F6>berg| date=March 12, 2008|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}</ref>

''Tomb of Horrors'' has also influenced later ''Dungeons & Dragons'' products. [[Jason Bulmahn]] used the module as well as [[Indiana Jones]] as  inspiration for some of the traps in the 2007 ''D&D'' supplement ''Dungeonscape''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20070305a|title=Product Spotlight: Dungeonscape|last=Carroll|first=Bart|date=March 5, 2007|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref> The computer role-playing game ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', developed for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] by [[Black Isle Studios]], was influenced by the module; Black Isle Studios division director [[Feargus Urquhart]] said, "We wanted something that reminded everyone of their first foray into dungeons like the Tomb of Horrors, with traps around every corner, and the undead crawling out of the walls."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.spong.com/article/230/Black_Isle_Studios_Presents_Icewind_Dale?cb=417|title=Black Isle Studios Presents Icewind Dale|date=May 11, 2000|accessdate=January 26, 2009|publisher=Spong}}</ref>
