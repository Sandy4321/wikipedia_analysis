'''Maryland Route 285''' is a {{convert|2.43|mi|adj=on}} road<ref name="cecil"/> in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], [[Maryland]] running along the north bank of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] from the [[Delaware]] border into [[Chesapeake City, Maryland|Chesapeake City]]. Starting at the Delaware border, Maryland 285 is called Biddle Road heading west. Maryland 285 is Biddle Street until it reaches [[Maryland Route 537|Maryland 537]] (Lock Street), which was [[U.S. Route 213]] before the bridge across the canal was destroyed in 1942. Maryland 285 follows Lock Street until it ends at [[Maryland Route 213|Maryland 213]]. Across the Delaware border, Maryland 285 continues as Chesapeake City Road, which connects to [[Delaware Route 71]].

==Route description==
Maryland State Route 285 begins at an intersection with Maryland State Route 213, which is a divided highway at this segment. The route progresses eastward, passing through fields to the south and forests to the north.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=39.539525&lon=-75.779465&zoom=18&q1=39.536708%2C-75.809077&q2=39.53056%2C-75.810557&q3=39.540762%2C-75.780281|title=Overview map of Maryland Route 285|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Incorporated|accessdate=March 28, 2009|year=2009}}</ref> At an intersection with Old Hemphill Street (designated as Cecil County Route 516) the route turns from the east and heads to the south. Once entering Chesapeake City, the speed limit is set for {{convert|25|mph|km/h}}.<ref name="cecil"/> The route progresses southward through the farms to the north of Chesapeake City.<ref name="yahoo"/>

Near a large family farm at an intersection with [[Maryland Route 284]] (Hemphill Street), Route 285 turns to the southeast, paralleling Hemphill Street, and enters the corporate limits of Chesapeake City. Immediately after entering Chesapeake City, Route 285 becomes more developed in its surroundings, and comes to an intersection with Maryland Route 537B, which continues the right-of-way of Lock Street. Route 285 at that intersection, turns eastward once again along Biddle Street.<ref name="yahoo"/>

Heading along Biddle Street, Route 285 passes a few local residences and intersects with the southern terminus of Maryland Route 284. After an intersection with Lewis Street, Route 285 leaves the corporate limits of Chesapeake City.<ref name="yahoo"/> There the speed limit upgrades from 25 to {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}. The route intersects with Foard Lane, where the highway becomes less developed, until approaching a high scale development east of Chesapeake City. After an intersection with Knights Corner Road (Cecil County Road 280), Route 285 turns to the northeast, heading through the fields, crossing the state line into Delaware. The highway continues eastward to Delaware Route 71 as Chesapeake City Road.<ref name="cecil"/>

== History ==
Maryland Route 285 was originally assigned by 1948, heading from [[U.S. Route 213]] to the Delaware state line. However, the route was shorter, as the intersection with Route 213 was farther south than it is currently. Route 213 followed Lock Street, over the extended alignment of 285 and Maryland Route 537B to cross a drawbridge over the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]].<ref name="1948quad">{{cite map|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-wilmington-1946.jpg|title=Wilmington, Delaware 1:250,000 quadrangle|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=1946|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}</ref>

The drawbridge was destroyed in 1942, when a tanker crashed into the bridge and brought it off its abutments. The route remained disconnected for seven years, and when the new bridge was constructed in 1949, Route 213 was realigned onto a new alignment.<ref name="ccmd">{{cite web|url=http://www.chesapeakecity.com/about.htm|title=About Chesapeake City, Maryland|date=2009|work=Chesapeake City, Maryland|publisher=[[Chesapeake City, Maryland]]|pages=1|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> The former alignment of U.S. Route 213 became an extension of Maryland 285 and the northern-most part of Maryland 537, 537B.<ref name="cecil"/>
