'''Nablus''' (''sometimes'' '''N<U+0101>bulus'''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{Audio|ArNablus.ogg|<big>'''<U+0646><U+0627><U+0628><U+0644><U+0633>'''</big>}}; {{IPA2|n<U+00E6><U+02D0>bl<U+028A>s}}) is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] city in the northern [[West Bank]], approximately {{km to mi|63}} north of [[Jerusalem]], with a population of 134,000. Located in a strategic position between [[Mount Ebal]] and [[Mount Gerizim]], it is the capital of the [[Nablus Governorate]] and a Palestinian commercial and cultural center.

Founded by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] in 72 CE as ''Flavia Neapolis'', the city has been ruled by many empires over the course of its almost 2,000 year long history. In the 5th and 6th centuries, conflict between the city's [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city. In 636, ''Neapolis'', along with most of [[Palestine]], came under the rule of the [[Muslim|Islamic]] [[Arab]] [[Caliphate]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]]; its name [[Arabic language|Arabicized]] to ''Nablus'', many of its churches and Samaritan synagogues gradually converted into [[mosque]]s. In 1099, the [[Crusade]]rs took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed. After [[Saladin]]'s [[Ayyubid]] forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires to follow. 

Following its incorporation into the Ottoman empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the ''Jabal Nablus'' ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, after a series of upheavals, a number of Arab clans from the northern and eastern [[Levant]] were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from amongst these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like [[Dhaher al-Omar]] in the 18th century, and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]] <U+2014> who briefly ruled Nablus <U+2014> in the 19th century. With Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade. After the loss of the city to [[United Kingdom|British]] forces during [[World War I]], Nablus was incorporated into the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] in 1922, and later designated to form part of the [[Arab]] state of [[Palestine]] under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN partition plan]]. The end of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] saw the city instead fell to [[Jordan]], to which it was unilaterally annexed, until its [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation]] by [[Israel]] during the 1967 [[Six Day War]]. 

Today, the city's population is predominantly [[Islam|Muslim]], with small Christian and Samaritan minorities. Since 1995, day-to-day administration is the purview of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], though Israel retains control over entrances and exits to the city. There are three [[Palestinian refugee camps]] located around Nablus, established in 1949-50. In the Old City, there are a number of sites of archaeological significance, spanning the 1st to 15th centuries. Regionally famous for its native sweet ''[[kanafeh]]'' and traditionally well-known for its [[Nabulsi soap|soap]] industry, Nablus' main economic sectors are in industry and commerce. 

== History ==
===Neapolis===
[[Image:Vespasianus01 pushkin edit.png|thumb|right|Roman emperor [[Vespasian]] founded Neopolis in 72 BCE]]
''Flavia Neapolis'' ("new city of the emperor [[Flavius]]") was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] on the site of the [[Samaritan]] village ''Mabartha'' ("the passage") in 72 CE. Located between [[Mount Ebal]] and [[Mount Gerizim]], the site lies two kilometers west of the [[Bible|Biblical]] city of [[Shechem]],<ref name="STF">{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html |title=Neapolis - (Nablus) |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=[[2000-12-19]] |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem}}</ref> which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref name="DNTA">{{cite web |url=http://www.dundee-nablus.org.uk/nablushistory.html |title=History of Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Dundee<U+2013>Nablus Twinning Association}}</ref> Holy places at the site of the city's founding include [[Joseph's Tomb]] and Jacob's Well. Due to the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former [[Judea]]n toparchy of [[Aqraba|Acraba]].<ref name="STF"/> 

Because the city was hostile to emperor [[Septimius Severus]], he temporarily deprived it of its municipal status in 145 CE. In 244 CE, [[Philip the Arab]] transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named ''Julia Neapolis''. It retained this status until the rule of [[Trebonianus Gallus]] in 251 CE. The birthplace of [[Justin Martyr]], who was brought up as a [[paganism|pagan]] but later converted to [[Christianity]], it is certain that Nablus had a bishop in 314 CE.<ref name="STF"/> The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE.<ref name="OCHA"/> 

===Samaritan revolts===
Conflict amongst the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis along with all of [[Palestine]] and [[Syria]] was under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The tension was a result of [[Monophysite]] Christian attempts to prevent the return of the [[Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Juvenal of Jerusalem|Juvenal]], to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name="STF"/> 

However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife. As tensions amongst the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the [[Samaritans]] grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of [[Aaron]]'s sons and grandsons [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]] and [[Phineas]]. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop [[Terebinthus]]. Terebinthus then fled to [[Constantinople]], requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor [[Zeno]] erected a church dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.<ref name="STF"/>

Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], Procopius. A third Samartian revolt which took place under the leadership of Julian Ben Saba in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of [[saint]]s. The forces of Emperor [[Justinian I]] were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.<ref name="STF"/>

===Islamic rule and the Crusades===
[[Image:Nablus Great Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|The minaret of the Great Mosque of Nablus, built in the early 1200s, 1908]]
Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the [[Arab]]s under [[Khaled ibn al-Walid]] <U+2014> a general of the [[Muslim]] [[Rashidun army]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]] <U+2014> in 636 after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].<ref name="STF"/><ref name="DNTA"/> The Arabs retained the city's name in its [[Arabic language|Arabicize]]d form, ''Nablus''. The city's cathedral was tranformed into a mosque, known locally as the "Great Mosque" and the synagogue built in 362 by the high priest Akbon was also turned into a mosque, known today as ''al-Khadra'' ("the green").<ref name="STF"/>

Nablus prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of [[Islam]]ic rule under the [[Umayyad]], [[Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Under Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and [[Persian people|Persian]]s, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and [[Jew]]s. The city was occupied by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] without a battle, in 1099 under the command of [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]] and renamed ''Naples''. The Muslim and Samaritan populations remained in the city, and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened a general [[Council of Nablus|social-religious council in Nablus]] to discuss improper religious customs.<ref name="STF"/> 

During the second half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces began launching incursions in order to regain control of the city. In 1137, Arab and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] troops stationed in [[Damascus]] made an incursion into Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches, but were unsuccessful in this bid to retake the city.<ref name="STF"/> 

Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city so as to resolve a dispute with her son [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Almaric]]. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and Resurrection of [[Jesus]], and in 1170 they also erected a hospice for pilgrims.<ref name="STF"/>

Crusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the [[Ayyubid]]s under [[Saladin]] captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in [[Syriac]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Christians]] fled Nablus, but the original [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian inhabitants remained. After its recapture by the Muslims, two Crusader churches were converted to the present-day mosques of an-Nasr and al-Masakim ("of lepers")<ref name="STF"/> and an Ayyubid mausoleum was built in the old city.<ref name="OCHA"/> The [[Mamluk]] dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their brief reign, they built numerous mosques and schools in the city.<ref name="DNTA"/>

===Ottoman era===
Nablus came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into five ''[[sanjak|sanjaqs]]'' ("districts"): [[Safad]], Jabal Nablus, [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza]] and [[Ajlun]]. These five ''sanjaqs'' were subdistricts of the ''[[wilayah|vilayet]]'' ("province") of [[Damascus]]. Jabal Nablus was further subdivided into four ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the ''nahiya'' were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as [[Beita]] and [[Aqraba]], were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the ''nahiya''.<ref name="Doumani3">{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&chunk.id=s2.1.3&toc.depth=1&toc.id=s1.1.6&brand=eschol |title=Rediscovering Palestine, Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700-1900: The 1657 Campaign |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Doumani |first=Beshara |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> In 1522, a [[Jew]]ish community settled in Nablus.<ref name="STF"/> 

After decades of minor upheavals and rebellions mounted by some of the Arab tribes in the [[Middle East]], the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab ''vilayets''. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force of local Ottoman-aligned Arab families based in various [[Syria]]n cities to pacify Nablus. In return for their services, the families were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid clusters of clans. The 1657 campaign succeeded and the Syrian Arab families began to have a foothold in Nablus' affairs. The largest family were the Nimrs, who originated from villages surrounding [[Hama]] and [[Hims]]. The other two prominent families were the Jarrars from [[Balqa]] and the Tuqans from northern Syria. Eventually gaining the role of ''nahiya'' chiefs, they began intermarrying with local merchant and leading religious families. Thus, these new families were integrated into Nablus' population. Under an arrangement in 1723, the Tuqans and the Nimrs would share and trade leadership of Nablus, and the Jarrars would "indisputably" become the chiefs of the ''nahiya'' of Jabal Nablus.<ref name="Doumani3"/>

In the mid-1700s, [[Dhaher al-Omar]], an Arab native of the [[Galilee]] and ruler of Acre who was hostile toward Ottoman rule, rose to become the most dominant figure in northern Palestine. In order to build up his military, he strove to gain monopoly control over the [[cotton]] and [[olive oil]] trade of the [[Levant]], which Jabal Nablus fueled. In 1771, during a [[Mamluk]] invasion of Syria, al-Omar aligned himself with the Mamluks, allowing him to temporarily besiege Nablus, without gaining ultimate control over the city. In 1773, he again led his army to besiege Nablus, but again to no avail. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges did succeed in raising Acre's prominence at Nablus' expense. Al-Omar's successor, [[Jezzar Pasha]], maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its original autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force to Acre's dominance over Nablus, rose to power.<ref name="Doumani4"/>

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
[[Image:Nablus 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1898]]
After the Egyptians declared independence from Ottoman rule under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Muhammed Ali]], they went on to conquer Palestine in 1831-32. A repressive policy of [[conscription]] and [[taxation]] was instituted which led to a revolt launched by the prominent Arab clans of Nablus, [[Hebron]] and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area. On [[May 19]] [[1834]], the clans, led by Qasim al-Ahmad <U+2014> the chief of ''nahiya'' [[Jammain]] <U+2014> notified Egyptian officials that Arab families would no longer supply the Egyptian army with troops. Governor [[Ibrahim Pasha]] responded by sending Egyptian forces into the rebelling cities, thus triggering armed conflict with the clans. Nablus sent hundreds of rebels to attack Jerusalem, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and they conquered the city on [[May 31]], but were routed out by Ibrahim's forces the next month. The Egyptians then forced the heads of the Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mideastweb.org/palrevolt.htm |title=The Growth of Palestinian Arab Identity |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Isseroff |first=Ami |publisher=MidEastWeb}}</ref> and executed Qasim al-Ahmad and his two eldest sons.<ref name="Doumani4">''[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&chunk.id=s2.1.5&toc.depth=1&toc.id=s1.1.6&brand=eschol Rediscovering Palestine, Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700-1900: Egyptian rule, 1831-1840]'' (1995) Doumani, Beshara. University of California Press.</ref>  

The Egyptian occupation of Palestine resulted in the destruction of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and thus, the political importance of Nablus increased. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from the Egyptians in 1840-41. As a result, the Abd al-Hadi clan, who originated in [[Arrabah]] in the [[Sahl Arraba]] region in northern [[Samaria]], rose to prominence. Loyal allies of Jezzar Pasha and the Tuqans, they gained the governorship of Jabal Nablus and other ''sanjaqs''.<ref name="Doumani4"/>

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Palestine. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of [[Jerusalem]] and the coastal cities of [[Jaffa]] and Acre. [[Olive oil]] was the primary product of Nablus and fueled other related industries such as [[Nabulsi soap|soap-making]] and basket weaving.<ref name="Doumani"/> In 1882, there were over thirty soap factories exporting their products throughout the [[Middle East]].<ref name="IO">{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml |title=<U+201C>Little Damascus<U+201D>: Nablus City, West Bank |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Islam Online}}</ref> Nablus was also the largest producer of [[cotton]] in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kilograms of the product by 1837.<ref name="Doumani5">{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&chunk.id=introduction&toc.depth=1&toc.id=introduction&brand=eschol |title=Rediscovering Palestine, Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700-1900: Cotton Production in Jabal Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Doumani |first=Beshara |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of [[autonomy]] than other ''sanjaqs'' under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no "foreigners" who held any military or bureaucratic posts.

===Twentieth century===
[[Image:Nablus 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of Nablus in 1918]]
During [[World War I]], British and Arab forces fought together to defeat Ottoman forces in the [[Sinai and Palestine campaign]]. Despite British assurances for Arab independence, as outlined in the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]], Palestine became a [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]] as assigned by the [[League of Nations]] in 1922. An [[earthquake]] in Palestine in 1927 destroyed many of the city's historic buildings, including the an-Nasr mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt in the mid-1930s, their previous "picturesque" character was lost. During British rule, Nablus emerged as a site of local resistance and the old city quarter of Qaryun was demolished by the British during the [[1936<U+2013>1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&chunk.id=ch2&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch2&brand=eschol&query=1927%20earthquake# |title=Rediscovering Palestine, Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700-1900: Family, Culture, and Trade |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Doumani |first=Beshara |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> 

Jewish immigration from Europe did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, as was the case for Palestine's coastal cities, Jerusalem, and the Galilee. As such, Nablus was to be included within the boundaries of the Arab state envisioned by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 partition plan for Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181: The Arab State |publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Tensions between the Arabs and the Jews exploded into the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. After [[Israel]] declared its independence as a Jewish state, Transjordan, one of the Arab countries participating in the war, occupied Nablus along with all of the present-day [[West Bank]] and [[East Jerusalem]]. Thousands of Palestinians fleeing towns captured by Israel settled into refugee camps around Nablus and in Nablus itself. Two such camps still located within the city limits today are [[Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]]. 

In 1967, after tensions between Israel and the Arabs grew dramatically due to a number of factors, Israel attacked [[Egypt]]'s air force bases in a pre-emptive strike. As a result, a coalition of Arab states immediately went to war against Israel. The [[Six-Day War]] ended in a swift Israeli victory and the occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and thus, Nablus. Many [[Israeli settlement]]s were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. Jurisdiction over the city was handed over to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] on [[December 12]] [[1995]], as a result of the [[Oslo Accords]] [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Interim Agreement on the West Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/chronology/19941995.htm |title=Palestine Facts 1994-1995 |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]] (PASSIA)}}</ref>

=== Nablus in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ===
[[Image:Huwwara Checkpoint Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|View from Nablus side of [[Huwwara Checkpoint]], with people waiting to travel south]]
Nablus has been a central flashpoint of violence between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and Palestinian militant groups. The level of violence dramatically increased from 2000 at the start of the [[Second Intifada]]. The city and the [[Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camps]] of [[Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]] constituted the center of "knowhow" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.<ref name="intelligence">{{cite web |url=http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/bu/Nablus/chapt.htm |title=<U+201C>The Terrorist Infrastructure in Nablus - Results and Forecast<U+201D> |accessdate=2008-04-24 |work=Terrorisminfo.org}}</ref> 

According to the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations against militants during the Second Intifada from 2000 to 2005.

At least 80 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged. The IDF also imposed a curfew on Nablus lasting between [[April 4]] and [[April 22]]. IDF forces reentered Nablus during [[Operation Determined Path]] in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews.<ref name="AI">{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/143/2002/en/dom-MDE151432002en.html |title=Israel and the Occupied Territories Shielded from scrutiny: IDF violations in Jenin and Nablus: Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}</ref>

Several historic buildings from the 1st to 15th century were severely damaged during IDF incursions. Israeli activists from [[Gush Shalom]] reported in April 2002, that IDF bulldozers destroyed 85% of al-Khadra Mosque and 20% of the Great Mosque and al-Satoon Mosque. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], located in Yasmin quarter, was also 40% destroyed and rendered unsafe for use. At least 60 houses from different historic periods were totally destroyed, and at least 80% of the renovated stone-paved streets of Nablus' old city were "totally damaged". The al-Shifa ''[[hammam]]'' was hit by three rockets from [[Apache helicopter]]s, the eastern entrance of the Khan al-Tujjar (old market) was completely destroyed, and three soap factories were completely destroyed, at least partly by [[F-16]] bombings. The cost of the damage to the old city has been estimated at $80 million US.<ref>[http://www.gush-shalom.org/terror/report1.html#nablus Report on the Destruction to Palestinian Institutions in Nablus and Other Cities (Except Ramallah) Caused by IDF Forces Between March 29 and April 21, 2002: Nablus].

===Old city===
[[Image:Shchem clock.jpg|thumb|right|The al-Manara clock tower in Nablus' old city]]
{{seealso|Syro-Palestinian archaeology#Nablus}}
In the center of Nablus, lies its old city. It is composed of six major quarters: al-Yasmina, al-Gharb, Qaryun, al-Aqaba, al-Qaysariyya and al-Habala. Al-Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and the prominent families residing therein are the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. Within the old city are five [[mosque]]s, the large "fortress-like" compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace, the Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Hall, as well as two soap factories, the al-Shifa ''[[hamaam]]'', several leather tanneries, and pottery and textile workshops.<ref name="Doumani2"/><ref name="NS"/>
 
There are a number of historic monuments in the old city, such as the Khan al-Tujjar and the al-Manara clocktower, the latter built in 1900. Saraya Square in the old city is home to the former offices of the Ottoman government.<ref name="NS"/>

==Climate==

According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 134,116 inhabitants in mid-year 2006.<ref name="PCBS"/> In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 [[Palestinian refugees|refugees]], accounting for about 24% of the city's residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t6.aspx  |title=Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS)}}</ref> The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its [[Nablus Governorate|governorate]]'s inhabitants.<ref name="PCBS"/>  

The majority of the city's inhabitants are [[Islam|Muslim]], but there are small [[Palestinian Christian|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] communities as well. In 1967, there were about 3,500 [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholic]] Christians in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrmea.com/archives/Jan_Feb_2008/0801050.html |title=<U+201C>We Need Justice,<U+201D> Says Father Yousef Sa<U+2019>adah, a Melkite Priest in Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Corillet |first=Joel |date=February 2008 |work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref> There are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in Nablus, five of which are located in the old city.<ref name="OCHA"/><ref name=NW/> Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century.<ref name="OCHA"/> In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains a Greek Orthodox church built in 1898 and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.<ref name=NW>[http://www.nablus.ws/nablus/maps.htm Places in Nablus] Nablus Website.</ref>

Nablus has a very large number of youths, approximately half of population being under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20-29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t1.aspx |title=Palestinian Population by Locality, Sex and Age Groups in Years |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]]}}</ref>

==Economy==
===Ottoman era===
The longevity and relative stability of Ottoman rule, as well as the broad political space it engendered, enhanced the advantages of Nablus' geographical location. Beginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]] were supplemented by the establishment of secure trading posts in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] regions to the south and east, as well as in the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. Nablus also developed some form of trade relations with [[Aleppo]], [[Mosul]], and [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Doumani2">{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&chunk.id=s2.1.1&toc.depth=1&toc.id=s1.1.5&brand=eschol |title=Rediscovering Palestine, Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700-1900: The City of Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Doumani |first=Beshara |date= |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>

The Ottoman government vigorously ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual [[hajj|pilgrimage]] caravan (''qafilat al-hajj'') from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. This policy greatly benefited Nablus economically. From the very beginning of Ottoman rule, pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha Ibn Abdullah, was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan (''amir al-hajj''), and he constructued a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.<ref name="Doumani2"/> 

Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap <U+2014> the city's most important commodity <U+2014> to Cairo by caravan through [[Gaza]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and by sea through the ports of [[Jaffa]] and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and [[Damietta]], Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, [[sugar]], and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, from whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.<ref name="Doumani2"/>

With regard to the local economy, agriculture was the major component. Outside of the city limits, there were extensive fields of [[olive]] groves, [[fig]] and [[pomegranate]] orchards and [[grape]] vineyards that covered the area's slopes. Crops, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and ''[[mulukhiyya]]'' were grown in the fields, vegetable gardens, and grain mills scattered across central [[Samaria]].<ref name="Doumani2"/>

===Modern-day===
[[Image:Naplouse Nablus.jpg|thumb|right|Inner city of Nablus, 1998]]
Nablus is a commercial trade center dealing in traditional industries such as the production of soap, olive oil, and [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]]. Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and [[leather tanning]]. The city is also a regional trading center for live produce. Most of these industries are centered in the old city.<ref name="NS"/>

The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory which deals with refining vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter from the factory is exported to [[Jordan]].<ref name="NS"/> The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150-200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from [[China]] and exports finished products to [[Israel]].<ref name="OCHA"/> There are eight restaurants in the city and four hotels <U+2014> the largest being al-Qasr. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from [[West Bank closures]] and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories still operating in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Restaurant.htm |title=Restaurants In Nablus}}{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Hotels.htm |title=Hotels In Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24  |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> 

Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of Nablus' workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade.<ref name="OCHA"/> The city's unemployment rates have increased dramatically in recent years, rising from 14.2% in 1997 to an estimate of 60% in 2004. Unemployment in the old city and in the refugee camps is estimated to be as high as 80%. Due to the ongoing [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], Nablus has been closed off by the IDF. The city's encirclement with checkpoints is cited by the [[United Nations]] as a reason for high unemployment and a "devastated" economy.<ref name="ocha1">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/opt/OCHA_Body-ASP_Files/Coordination_Sec/OCHA-oPt_FCU_BIOs_PDFs/OCHA-oPt_Nablus-FCU_Bio_Data-22Nov04.pdf |title=Bio Data <U+2013> Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |format=PDF |publisher=United Nation Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}}</ref>

Nablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout Palestine and the [[Arab world]] with significant and unique contributions to [[Palestinian culture]], [[Palestinian cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Palestinian costumes|costume]]. ''[[Nabulsi]]'', meaning "from Nablus", is used to describe items such as [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]] (e.g. [[Nabulsi soap]]) and food products (e.g. [[Nabulsi cheese]]) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.  

===Traditional costume===
{{main|Palestinian costumes}}
Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing ''[[souk]]'' ("market"), in late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] [[silk]] to [[Manchester]] [[cotton]]s and [[calico]]s. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the [[Galilee]], both long and short [[Turkish culture|Turkish style]] jackets were worn over the ''thob'' ("robe"). For daily wear, ''thobs'' were often made of white cotton or [[linen]], with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqu<U+00E9> and braidwork popularly decorating the ''qabbeh'' ("square chest piece").<ref name=PCA2>{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-08-01 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024053919/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
Nablus is one of the few Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture "high cuisine", such as that of [[Damascus]] or [[Baghdad]]. The city is home to a number of food products well-known throughout the Levant, the [[Arab world]] and the former [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]]. 

''[[Kanafeh]]'' is the most famed ''Nabulsi'' sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 1400s, by 1575, its recipe was exported throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]] <U+2014> which controlled Palestine at the time. ''Kanafeh'' is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the [[Levant]], to the present day, Nablusi ''kanafeh'' enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brined cheese called ''[[Nabulsi cheese|jibneh Nabulsi]]''. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for ''kanafeh''.<ref name="IMEU2">{{cite web |url=http://imeu.net/news/article008132.shtml |title=Cuisine |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=[[2006-01-16]] |publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]]}}</ref>

Other famous Nablus sweets include ''[[baklawa]]'', ''burma'' and ''ghuraybeh'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/nablus.html |title=Nablus, Holy Land |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency}}</ref> a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an "S"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nablusculture.ps/nablus,sweets.htm |title=Nabulsi Sweets |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus the Culture}}</ref>

===Soap===
{{main|Nabulsi soap}}
Nabulsi soap or ''sabon nabulsi'' is a type of [[castile soap]] produced only in Nablus<ref name=Piefza>{{cite web |title=Palestinian Industries |url=http://www.piefza.org/a_pal_industries.htm |publisher=Piefza.com |accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref> and made of three primary ingredients: virgin [[olive oil]], water, and a sodium compound.<ref name=IMEU>{{cite web |title=Nablus' olive oil soap: a Palestinian tradition lives on |author=Michael Phillips |publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]] (IMEU) |date=[[March 11]] [[2008]] |accessdate=2008-03-27 |url=http://imeu.net/news/article008132.shtml}}</ref> Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product,<ref name=SEMP>{{cite web |title=Nablus Soap: Cleaning Middle Eastern Ears for Centuries |publisher=Suburban Emergency Management Project |date=[[2006-09-20]] |accessdate=2008-03-27 |url=http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=402}}</ref> and has been exported across the Arab world and to [[Europe]].<ref name=IMEU/> Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.<ref name=IMEU/><ref name=SEMP/>

Made in a cube-like shape about {{in to cm|1.5}} tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of "the page of an old book."<ref name=SEMP/> The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it.<ref name=Shakaa>{{cite web |title=Natural ...

Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day [[Jordan]] in large [[Camel train|caravans]]. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural [[alkaline]] soda powder called ''qilw''.<ref name=SEMP/> Today, ''qilw'' is still used in combination with lime. 

===Cultural centers===
There are three cultural centers in Nablus mainly centered on providing activities for children. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building for merchants, features an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_cult_center.htm |title=Child Cultural Center |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture, which it does by hosting festivals on social occasions, teaching traditional dance known as the ''[[dabke]]'', and launching field trips to other parts of the West Bank. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a [[football (soccer)|football]] and [[chess]] team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_happienies_center.htm |title=Children Happiness Center |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/hamdy_manko.htm |title=Nablus Municipality Cultural Center <U+201C>Future Kids<U+201D> |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref>

==Government==
The city of Nablus is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) of the [[Nablus Governorate]], and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.<ref name="NMMC">{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/aboutus/municipal_council.htm |title=Nablus Municipal Council |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> 

There are two primary political parties represented in the municipal council: [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]].

On [[July 2]] [[1980]], [[Bassam Shaka]], then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a [[car bombing]] carried out by [[Gush Emunim Underground|underground Israeli militants]] affiliated with the [[Gush Emunim]] movement.<ref name="haaretz">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=600596 |first=Danny |last=Rubenstein |authorlink=Danny Rubenstein |title=<U+201C>Fighting words/Far from the madding crowd<U+201D> |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Haaretz}}</ref> 

The current mayor, [[Adly Yaish]], a Hamas member, was arrested by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] on [[May 23]] [[2007]], during an [[Operation Summer Rains|over-night raid]] in the West Bank, which the Israeli authorities stated was in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] by Hamas.<ref name="ynet">{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403756,00.html |title=Palestinians report IDF forces raid Nablus overnight in arrest operation, taking 33 Hamas leaders into custody, including PA minister of education, mayors of Nablus, Qalqiliya |accessdate=2008-04-24 |last=Waked |first=Ali |date=[[2007-05-24]] |work=Ynet News |publisher=Yedioth Internet}}</ref> Municipal council members [[Abdel Aziz Duwaik|Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa "Dweikat"]] and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested.<ref name="NMMC"/>

==Education==
According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 70% of Nablus' population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t3.aspx |title=Palestinian Population (10 Years and Over) by Locality, Sex and Educational Attainment |accessdate=2008-04-24 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS)}}</ref> In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the [[Nablus Governorate]]; 196 schools are run the by [[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority]], 14 by the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mohe.gov.ps/downloads/pdffiles/statisticE.pdf |title=Statistics About General Education in Palestine |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Education Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]]}}</ref>

Nablus is also home to [[an-Najah National University]], the largest [[List of Palestinian universities|Palestinian university]] in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the [[First Intifada]], but was reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The univeristy's faculties include seven in the [[humanities]] and nine in the [[sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.najah.edu/nnu_portal/index.php?page=56&lang=en |title=About An-Najah |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=An-Najah National University Official Website}}</ref>

==Local infrastructure==
===Fire department===
Nablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the "fire brigade" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, It was responsible for the all of the northern West Bank, but today it ony covers the Nablus and [[Tubas Governorate]]s. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department has extinguished 15,346 fires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/services/Fire_Brigade.htm#Fire_statistics_for_the_last_10_years__ |title=Fire Brigade |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> 

===Medical facilities===
There are six [[hospital]]s in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani and the Rafidia Surgery Hospital. The latter, located in Nablus' western suburbs, is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in [[oncology]] services.<ref name="OCHA"/> The [[Anglican]] St. Lukes hospital and the National Hospital were built in 1900 and 1910 respectively.<ref name="NMG"/><ref name="NS"/> In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies.<ref name="NMG">[http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Pharmacies.htm Pharmacies] and [http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/hospitals.htm Hospitals] Nablus Municipality Guides.</ref>

===Utilities===
According to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, those city residents who had electricity received it from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/services/electrical_dept_projects/elec_dept_Introduction.htm |title=Electricity Department Statistics |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref> 

Unlike other localities within the governorate (excluding refugee camps), the majority of the city's households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the reminaing 7% connected through cesspits.<ref name="PCBS4">[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/nab_t10.aspx Occupied Housing Units by Locality and Connection to Electricity Network in Housing Unit] </br>

===Transportation===
The main Ramallah-Nablus road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus. The city is connected to [[Tulkarm]], [[Qalqilya]] and [[Jenin]] through western offshoots from the main road. The [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|Israeli checkpoint]]s of Beit Iba, at-Tur, [[Huwwara Checkpoint|Huwwara]] and Beit Furik around Nablus hamper the travel of residents to and from the city. The checkpoints were established by Israel after the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]], which gave Palestinians complete authority over the city and its vicinity. Since January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private travelers are obligated to obtain a permit from the Israeli military authorities before leaving or entering Nablus.<ref name="OCHA"/>

The nearest airport is the [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] in [[Lod]], [[Israel]], but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, residents often travel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] to use the [[Queen Alia International Airport]]. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |title=Taxi offices |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref>
