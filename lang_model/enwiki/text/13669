{{nihongo|'''Osachi Hamaguchi''' |<U+6FF1><U+53E3> <U+96C4><U+5E78>|Hamaguchi Osachi|[[1 April]] [[1870]]<U+2013>[[26 August]][[1931]]}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[politician]] and the 27th [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from [[2 July]] [[1929]] to [[14 April]] [[1931]]. He was called the "Lion prime minister"(<U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30AA><U+30F3><U+5BB0><U+76F8>) due to his physical features.

==Early life ==
Hamaguchi was born in what is now [[K<U+014D>chi, K<U+014D>chi|Kochi]] city, [[Kochi Prefecture]] on the island of [[Shikoku]]; his father was an official in the forestry department. He graduated from the Law College of [[Tokyo Imperial University]] and began his career as a bureaucrat in the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Ministry of Finance]]. In 1907, he became director of the Monopoly Bureau. He became Vice Communications Minister in 1912 and Vice Finance Minister in 1914. 

==Political career==

Hamaguchi was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] in the [[Japanese Diet]] in 1915, as a member of the [[Kenseikai]] political party. He later served as Finance Minister under the 1st and 2nd administrations of [[Kato Takaaki]] (1924, 1925) and as [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Minister]] under the cabinet of [[Wakatsuki Reijiro]] (1926). 

In 1927, Hamaguchi became the chairman of the new [[Rikken Minseito]] political party formed by the merger of the [[Kenseikai]] and the [[Seiyu Honto]]. 

==Prime Minister==

After the collapse of the administration of [[Tanaka Giichi]] in 1929, Hamaguchi became [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and formed a cabinet based largely on Minseito party members.

With a strong sense of his own rectitude and a tough, stubborn temperament, Hamaguchi inspired trust. Initial public confidence bolstered Hamaguchi's government and allowed him to successfully challenge the ascendant military radicals within Japan. However, his settlement of the [[London Naval Conference]] treaty of 1930, in which he tried to set the ratio of battle ships for the US, Britain, and Japan at 10:10:7 but was forced to agree to a 10:10:6 ratio, led many right-wing politicians and conservatives to think that Hamaguchi had sold out on Japanese national security. This released a surge of Japanese nationalism and resulted in the end of Shidehara/Hamaguchi diplomacy (which supported peaceful economic expansion).

In his term of office, Hamaguchi attempted to strengthen the Japanese economy through fiscal austerity measures. Hamaguchi's fiscal policy, however, proved disastrous. The Hamaguchi government put Japanese [[Yen]] on the [[gold standard]] to help stimulate exports, a measure that greatly worsened the impact of the worldwide [[Great Depression of 1929]] on the already feeble economy. This failure of Hamaguchi<U+2019>s economic played into the hands of right-wing elements, already enraged by the government's conciliatory foreign policies and efforts to reduce military spending.

Hamaguchi fell victim to an assassination attempt on [[14 November]] [[1930]] when he was shot in [[Tokyo Station]] by [[Tomeo Sagoya]], a member of the ''[[Aikoku-sha]]'' ultranationalist secret society. (Nine years earlier another Prime Minister, [[Hara Takashi]], had been assassinated near the same place.) The wounds kept Hamaguchi hospitalized for several months, but he struggled through physical weakness to win the February 1931 election. He returned to his post in March of 1931 but resigned a month later to be replaced by [[Reijiro Wakatsuki]].
