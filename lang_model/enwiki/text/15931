'''''Achtung Baby''''' is the seventh studio album by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. Produced by [[Daniel Lanois]] and [[Brian Eno]], it was released on 19 November 1991 on [[Island Records]]. Stung by the criticism of their 1988 release ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'', U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate [[alternative rock]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[electronic dance music]] influences into their sound. Thematically, the album is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than the band's previous work. ''Achtung Baby'' and the subsequent multimedia-intensive [[Zoo TV Tour]] were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, which replaced their earnest public image with a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one.

Seeking inspiration on the eve of [[German reunification]], U2 began recording ''Achtung Baby'' in Berlin's [[Hansa Studios]] in October 1990. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. After weeks of tension and slow progress, the group made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]". They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of recordings were completed. The album's title and colourful multi-image sleeve were chosen to confound expectations of U2 and their music.

One of U2's most successful records, ''Achtung Baby'' earned favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], while topping the charts in many other countries. It spawned five hit singles, including "One", "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]", and "[[The Fly (U2 song)|The Fly]]". The album has sold 18&nbsp;million copies worldwide and won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1993 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]. One of the most acclaimed records of the 1990s, ''Achtung Baby'' is regularly featured on lists of the greatest albums of all-time.

==Background==
U2's 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' brought them critical acclaim and commercial success, but their high exposure precipitated a critical backlash,<ref name="chop-joshua" /><ref name="fricke">{{cite magazine|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071026111642/www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/u2s_serious_fun | title=U2's Serious Fun |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fricke |authorlink=David Fricke |date=1992-10-01 | accessdate = 2010-04-26|issue=640}}</ref> whereby they were accused of being grandiose, over-earnest, and self-righteous.<ref name="fricke" /> The band's exploration of [[American popular music|American music]] on their 1988 ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' motion picture and album was labelled "pretentious" and "misguided and bombastic".<ref name="rs" />

Despite their popularity, the group were dissatisfied creatively, and lead vocalist [[Bono]] believed they were musically unprepared for their success.<ref name="fricke" /><ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref> Drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] said, "We were the biggest, but we weren't the best" and that he had become bored playing the band's greatest hits.<ref name="fricke" /><ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 4</ref> U2 described their collaboration with [[blues]] musician [[B.B. King]] on ''Rattle and Hum'' and the 1989 [[Lovetown Tour]] as "an excursion down a dead-end street", which was misunderstood by audiences.<ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 25, 27<U+2013>28</ref><ref name="m213"/> Bono said that, in retrospect, listening to [[African-American music|black music]] enabled the group to create a work such as ''Achtung Baby'', while their experiences with [[folk music]] helped him to develop as a lyricist.<ref name="m213">McCormick (2006), p. 213</ref> Towards the end of the Lovetown Tour, Bono announced on-stage that it was "the end of something for U2", and that "we have to go away and [...] dream it all up again". Following the tour, the group began its longest break from public performances and album releases.<ref>de la Parra (1994), pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref>

Reacting to the criticism and their sense of musical stagnation, the band searched for new musical ground.<ref name="fricke" /><ref name="eno">{{cite magazine |title=Bringing Up Baby |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Brian|last=Eno|authorlink=Brian Eno|date=1991-11-28|issue=618}}</ref> They wrote "God Part II" from ''Rattle and Hum'' after realising they had excessively pursued nostalgia in their songwriting. The song had a more contemporary feel that Bono said was closer to ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s direction.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 204<U+2013>207</ref> Further indications of change were two recordings they made in 1990; the first was a cover version of "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" for the first ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' release. U2 used [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] beats and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] elements for the first time in this recording. The second was Bono's and guitarist [[The Edge]]'s contribution to the original score of ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''{{'}}s theatrical adaptation. Much of the material they wrote was experimental, and according to Bono, "prepar[ed] the ground for ''Achtung Baby''". Ideas deemed inappropriate for the play were put aside for the band's use.<ref name="m215">McCormick (2006), p. 215</ref> This period saw Bono and The Edge increasingly writing songs without Mullen or bassist [[Adam Clayton]].<ref name="m215" />

In mid-1990, Bono reviewed material he had written in Australia on the Lovetown Tour, and the group recorded [[Demo (music)|demo]]s at STS Studios in Dublin.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Not Quite Better Than the Real Thing |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |first=Stuart |last=Bailie |date=2001-10|issue=182}}</ref><ref name="m216">McCormick (2006), p. 216</ref> The demos later evolved into the songs "[[Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses]]", "[[Until the End of the World (song)|Until the End of the World]]", "[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]", and "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]".<ref name="m216" /> Going into the album sessions, the band wanted the record to completely deviate from their past work, but they were unsure how to achieve this.<ref name="m221" /> The emergence of the [[Madchester]] scene in the UK left them confused about how they would fit into any particular musical scene.<ref name="m216" />

To [[record producer|produce]] the album, U2 hired [[Daniel Lanois]] and [[Brian Eno]], who had previously worked with the group on ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' and ''The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="g43" >Graham (2004), p. 43</ref> Lanois was principal producer, with [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]] as [[Audio engineering|engineer]].<ref name="eno" /> Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for a week at a time to review their work before leaving for a month or two.<ref name="eno" /><ref name="xxv">Gardner (1994), p. xxv</ref> Eno said his role was "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2".<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with U2's Larry Mullen Jr.|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Jim|last=DeRogatis|authorlink=Jim DeRogatis|date=2005-05-01}}</ref> By distancing himself from the work, he believes he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them.<ref name="eno-prop" /> As he explained, "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold".<ref>DeRogatis (2003), p. 194</ref> The Lanois<U+2013>Eno team used [[lateral thinking]] and a philosophical approach<U+2014>popularised by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]]<U+2014>that contrasted with ''Rattle and Hum'' producer [[Jimmy Iovine]]'s direct and retro style.<ref name="g44" />

===Berlin sessions===
The band believed that "domesticity [w]as the enemy of rock 'n' roll" and that to work on the album, they needed to remove themselves from their normal family-oriented routines. With a "[[New Europe]]" emerging at the end of the [[Cold War]], they chose Berlin, in the centre of the reuniting continent, as a source of inspiration for a more European musical aesthetic.<ref name="fricke" /><ref name="g43" /><ref name="Flanagan 1996, p. 7">Flanagan (1996), pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref> They recorded at [[Hansa Studios]] in [[West Berlin]], near the recently opened [[Berlin Wall]]. Several acclaimed records were made at Hansa, including two of [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Berlin Trilogy]]" with Eno, and [[Iggy Pop]]'s ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]''.<ref name="m216" /> U2 arrived on 3 October 1990 on the last flight into [[East Berlin]] on the eve of [[German reunification]].<ref name="m216" /> Expecting to be inspired, they instead found Berlin to be depressing and gloomy.<ref name="m221">McCormick (2006), p. 221</ref> The collapse of the Berlin Wall had resulted in a state of malaise in Germany. The band found their East Berlin hotel to be dismal and the winter inhospitable, while the run-down condition of Hansa Studios and its location in an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] ballroom added to the "bad vibe".<ref name="m221" /><ref name="prop-berlin">{{cite magazine |title=The Berlin Sessions |magazine=Propaganda |issue=14 |date=1991-06-01}}</ref>

Morale worsened once the sessions commenced, as the band worked long days but could not agree on a musical direction.<ref name="prop-berlin" /> The Edge had been listening to electronic dance music and to [[industrial music|industrial]] bands like [[Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], the [[Young Gods]], and [[KMFDM]]. He and Bono advocated new musical directions along these lines. In contrast, Mullen was listening to [[classic rock]] acts such as [[Blind Faith]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]], and was learning how to "play around the beat".<ref name="fricke" /><ref name="m215" /> Along with Clayton, he was more comfortable with a sound similar to U2's previous work and was resistant to the proposed innovations.<ref name="fricke" /><ref name="m221" /> Further, The Edge's interest in dance club mixes and [[drum machine]]s made Mullen feel that his contributions as a drummer were being diminished.<ref name="m221" /> Lanois was expecting the "textural and emotional and cinematic U2" of ''The Unforgettable Fire'' and ''The Joshua Tree'', and he did not understand the "throwaway, trashy kinds of things" on which Bono and The Edge were working.<ref name="fricke" /> Compounding the divisions between the two camps was a change in the band's longstanding songwriting relationship; Bono and The Edge were working more closely together, writing material in isolation from the rest of the group.<ref name="m215" /><ref name="Flanagan 1996, p. 7"/><ref>Graham (1996), p. 28</ref>

U2 found that they were neither prepared nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs.<ref name="m221" /> For the first time, the group could not find consensus during their disagreements and felt that they were not making progress.<ref name="m221" /> Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of "Mysterious Ways".<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 104</ref> With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up.<ref name="flan10">Flanagan (1996), pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref> Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought.<ref name="flan10" /><ref name="stokes-one" /> By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that The Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' "desire to hold on to solid song structures".<ref name="flan10" /> In December, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref name="one">McCormick (2006), pp. 221<U+2013>224</ref> The Edge combined two [[chord progression]]s on guitar, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised most of the song. It provided much-needed reassurance, and re-validated their longstanding "blank page approach" to writing and recording together.<ref name="one" /><ref>Flanagan (1996), pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref>

U2 returned to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded better than they originally thought.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 12</ref> They briefly returned to Berlin in January 1991 to finish their Hansa work.<ref name="mcg134-5">McGee (2008), pp. 134<U+2013>135</ref>  Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, The Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested.<ref name="one" /><ref name="stokes-one">Stokes (1996), p. 98</ref><ref name="adams" /> The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing a certain "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas were to be revisited in the Dublin sessions with success.<ref name="one" />

===Dublin sessions===

In February 1991, U2 resumed the album's sessions in the seaside manor "Elsinore" in [[Dalkey]], renting the house for <U+20A4>10,000 per month.<ref name="mcg134-5" /><ref name="adams">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/mar94/u2robbieadams.html |title=U2 & Robbie Adams |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |first=Paul |last=Tingen |date=1994-03 |accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref> Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings.<ref name="adams" /> Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house,<ref name="mcg134-5" /> with the recording room in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room.

In April, tapes from the earlier Berlin sessions were leaked and [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]]. Bono dismissed the leaked demos as "gobbledygook", and The Edge likened the situation to "being violated".<ref name="details">{{cite magazine|title=U2 Anew|magazine=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]|date=1992-09-01}}</ref> The leak shook the band's confidence and soured their collective mood a few weeks.<ref name="Q-int" /> Staffing logistics meant that the group found themselves with three engineers, and they decided to split recording between Elsinore and The Edge's home studio.<ref name="adams" /> Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: "There was always something different to listen to, always something exciting happening."<ref name="adams" /> To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24-track [[analogue recording]], a [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] machine, and a synchroniser.<ref name="adams" /> At the end of May, final lyrics and vocal takes had yet to be completed, but Lanois believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Lanois |magazine=Propaganda |issue=14 |date=1991-06-01}}</ref>

During the Dublin sessions, Eno was sent tapes of the previous two months' work, which he called a "total disaster". Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive [[overdubbing]]. The group believes his intervention saved the album.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=2327 |title=Brian Eno|first=Andy |last=Gill |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date=1995-06|accessdate=2010-06-12}} Note: A subscription is required to access the article.</ref> Eno theorised that the band was too close to their music, explaining, "if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You're so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind."<ref name="eno-prop">{{cite magazine |title=Eno |magazine=Propaganda |issue=16 |date=1992-06-01}}</ref> Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the deadline to finish recording; he recalls that "everything seemed like a mess", and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday from working on the album. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=8644 |title=Brian Eno: "So Why Are We Doing This?"|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |first=Andy |last=Gill |date=2001-05|accessdate=2010-06-12}} Note: A subscription is required to access the article.</ref>

U2 is credited with composing the music for all of ''Achtung Baby''{{'}}s tracks,<ref name="album" /> despite periods of separated songwriting. The band wrote much of the music through [[jam sessions]], a common practice for them.<ref name="m221" /> The record is a mix of anthemic tracks similar to the group's previous work and darker songs that explore new sonic territory for the group.<ref name="hotpress" /> They referred to the album's musical departure as "the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree".<ref name="chop-joshua">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/u2/reviews/10793 |title=U2 <U+2013> The Joshua Tree Re-Mastered (R1987) |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |first=Andrew |last=Mueller|authorlink=Andrew Mueller |accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref><ref name="ach-stations" /> Accordingly, the distorted [[introduction (music)|introduction]] to the opening track "[[Zoo Station]]" was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly not the new U2 album.<ref name="comp" /> Author Susan Fast said that with the group's use of technology in the song's opening, "there can be no mistake that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them".<ref name="exp">Fast (2000), pp. 45<U+2013>48</ref>

The sleeve artwork for ''Achtung Baby'' was designed by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers.<ref name="prop-cover">{{cite magazine |title=(<U+0102>hk-t<U+014F><U+014F>ng B<U+0101>y-bi) Covered |magazine=Propaganda |issue=15 |date=1991-12-01}}</ref> To mirror their change in musical direction, the band considered sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with the seriousness of the mostly black-and-white images of their previous album sleeves.<ref name="prop-cover" /><ref name="mcg138">McGee (2008), p. 138</ref> Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some more experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, "dance-music oriented sleeves. We just did them to show how extreme we could go and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn't gone to these extremes it may not have the been the cover it is now."<ref name="prop-cover" />

An initial photo shoot with the band's long-time photographer, [[Anton Corbijn]], was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 133</ref> Most of the photos were black-and-white,<ref name="prop-cover" /> and the group felt they were not indicative of the spirit of the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in [[Tenerife]] in February 1991,<ref name="mcg134-5" /> for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], presenting a more playful side of themselves.<ref name="mcg134-5" /> It was during the group's time in Tenerife, and during a four-day shoot in [[Morocco]] in July, that they were photographed in [[drag (clothing)|drag]].<ref name="mcg134-5" /> Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 136</ref> The images were intended to confound expectations of U2,<ref name="finish" /> and their full colour contrasted with the monochrome imagery on past sleeves.<ref name="mcg138" />

A single image scheme had been planned for the sleeve, and among the photographs considered were those of a cow on an Irish farm in [[County Kildare]], the nude Clayton, and the band driving a [[Trabant]]<U+2014>an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe.<ref name="prop-cover" /> Ultimately, a multiple image scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers could not agree on a single image;<ref name="prop-cover" /> the resulting front sleeve is a 4<U+00D7>4 squared montage.<ref name="finish" /> The band wanted to balance the "colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco".<ref name="prop-cover" /> Some photographs were used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity.<ref name="prop-cover" /> Images of the band with Trabants, several of which were painted bright colours, appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet.

The album's title, "Achtung Baby", is German for "Attention, baby!" or "Watch out, baby!", and it was used by the band's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy during recording.<ref name="g43" /> He reportedly took the phrase from the [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]''.<ref name="finish" /> The title was selected in August 1991 near the end of the album sessions.<ref name="prop-cover" /> According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album.<ref name="finish" /> The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as "The Fly".<ref name="Flanagan 1996, p. 21">Flanagan (1996), pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> Of the title, Bono said in 1992, "It's a con, in a way.

[...] It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else."<ref name="fricke" />

For the album, U2 had considered several titles, including ''Man''<U+2014>in contrast to the group's debut, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]''<ref name="rockbig">{{cite magazine |title=Rock and Roll Should Be This Big! |magazine=[[NME]] |first=Stuart |last=Bailie |date=1992-06-13}}</ref><U+2014>''69'', ''Zoo Station'', and ''Adam'', which would have been paired with the nude photo of Clayton.<ref name="fricke" /><ref name="prop-cover" /> Other possible titles included ''Fear of Women'', and ''Cruise Down Main Street''<U+2014>in reference to [[The Rolling Stones]]' record ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' and the cruise missiles launched on [[Baghdad]] during the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="Flanagan 1996, p. 21"/> Most of the proposed titles were rejected out of the belief that people would see them as pretentious and "another Big Statement from U2".<ref name="rockbig" /> The album's lighthearted title influenced other musicians, including [[David Bowie]], who was an inspiration to U2 and Eno during recording of ''Achtung Baby''. Bowie's band [[Tin Machine]] called their live record ''[[Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby]]'', putting a Yiddish spin on U2's German title.<ref>Perone (2007), p. 105</ref>

==Release==
As early as December 1990, the music press reported that U2 would be recording a dance-oriented album and that it would be released in the summer 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318875,00.html | title = U2 Can Dance | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | issue = 45 | first = Elysa | last = Gardner | date = 1990-12-21 | accessdate = 2009-12-31}}</ref> In August 1991, [[sound collage]] artists [[Negativland]] released an [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]'' that parodied U2's song "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" and used the band's likenesses on the cover. [[Island Records]] objected to the cover, believing consumers would confuse the EP for U2's new record.

Island Records and U2 refused to make advance copies of the album available to the press until just a few days before the release date, preferring fans to listen to the record before reading reviews. The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and David Browne compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding review copies of films from the media before release whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316187,00.html |issue=92 |title=U2 Would Worry|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=David |last=Browne |authorlink=David Browne |date=1991-11-15 |accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref> ''Achtung Baby'' was released on 19 November 1991 on compact disc, tape cassette, and vinyl record.

Upon its release, ''Achtung Baby'' received very favourable reviews from critics.<ref name="g43" /><ref name="details" /> Elysa Gardner of ''Rolling Stone'', in a four-and-a-half-star review, said that U2 had "proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock & roll."<ref name="rs" /> The review said that the album, like its predecessor ''Rattle and Hum'', was an attempt by the band to "broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized".<ref name="rs" /> [[David Browne]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the record an "A" and called it a "pristinely produced and surprisingly unpretentious return by one of the most impressive bands in the world".<ref name="ew">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316330,00.html |title=Music Review: Achtung Baby |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=94 |first=Bill |last=Wyman |date=1991-11-19 |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref> Steve Morse of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' echoed these sentiments, stating that the album "not only reinvigorates their sound, but drops any self-righteousness.

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured a very positive review of ''Achtung Baby'', calling it a record of "major-league guitar crunching and mysterious, spacy chords" and "songs of love, temptation, loose political parable and tight personal confession". The review declared that U2 had successfully reinvented themselves.<ref name="time">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974333,00.html |title=Dashing and Demanding |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Jay|last=Cocks|authorlink=Jay Cocks|date=1991-11-25 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> In a four-star review, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated, "the arty, guitar-driven textures are among the band's most confident and vigorous ever". The newspaper said that despite the "exhilarating and sensual textures", the album is a difficult one for listeners because of the dark, introspective nature of the songs. The reviewer explained that U2 had lost some of its individuality by transitioning from inspirational songs in the past to tracks with more dismal subject matter, an area in popular music that was well-covered.<ref name="latimes" /> In a retrospective review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] gave ''Achtung Baby'' a maximum score of five stars, praising the band's musical transformation as "thorough", "effective", and "endlessly inventive". Erlewine concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have "recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [did]".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:br61mpe39f2o |title=Achtung Baby <U+2013> Overview |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' was more critical of the record, calling it an "ambitious failure"; the review welcomed the experimentation but judged that when the group "strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Platter Du Jour |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |first=Jim |last=Greer|date=1991-12|issue=7|volume=9}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] rated it a dud, reflecting in his review of the group's 1993 album ''[[Zooropa]]'', "After many, many tries, ''Achtung Baby'' still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song."<ref name="RobC">{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=u2 |title=U2 <U+2013> Consumer Guide Reviews |publisher=[[Robert Christgau]] |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> In an otherwise positive retrospective, long-time U2 supporter Bill Graham said that the album seemed "over-calculated" in parts and that they were trying too hard to satisfy their critics.<ref name="g46" />

The success of ''Achtung Baby'' and the Zoo TV Tour re-established U2 as one of the most popular and critically acclaimed musical acts in the world. The group nearly swept ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 1992 end-of-year readers' polls, winning honours for "Best Single" ("One"), "Artist of the Year", "Best Album", "Best Songwriter" (Bono), "Best Album Cover", and "Comeback of the Year", among others.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 159</ref> At the [[35th Grammy Awards]] in 1993, ''Achtung Baby'' won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], and it earned Lanois and Eno the award for [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year|Producer of the Year]].

==Zoo TV Tour==
[[File:ZooTVBstage.jpg|thumb|alt=In an outdoor stadium at night with an elaborate concert stage set bearing a logo that reads "Zoo TV", a number of white lights shine from various angles into the center of the audience on the stadium floor, where a musical performance is taking place on a very small stage.|The Zoo TV Tour was a multimedia-intensive event, featuring a stage that used dozens of video screens.<ref name="prop-tour" />]]

Following the release of ''Achtung Baby'', U2 staged a worldwide tour, titled the [[Zoo TV Tour]]. Like ''Achtung Baby'', the tour was an unequivocal break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised television and the viewing public's over-stimulation by attempting to instill "sensory overload" in its audience.<ref name="ach-stations" /><ref name="closer-to-edge">{{cite magazine|title=Closer to the Edge|first=Olaf|last=Tyaransen|authorlink=Olaf Tyaransen|magazine=[[Hot Press]] |date=2002-12-04}}</ref><ref name="zooropa" /> The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from [[pop culture]], and flashing text phrases. Live satellite link-ups, [[channel surfing]], [[crank call]]s, and video [[confessional]]s were incorporated into the shows.<ref name="prop-tour">{{cite magazine |title=Sixty-Nine Things You May Not Have Known About Life in the Zoo |magazine=Propaganda |issue=17 |date=1993-01-01}}</ref>

Whereas the group was known for its earnest performances in the 1980s, their Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-mocking.<ref name="ach-stations" /> Bono performed in-character as several personas he had conceived, including "The Fly", "Mirror Ball Man", and "Mr. MacPhisto". The majority of the album's songs were played at each show, and the [[set list]]s began with up to eight ''Achtung Baby'' songs in a row as a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s.<ref name="mcg143">McGee (2008), p. 143</ref>

The tour began in February 1992 and comprised 157 shows over almost two years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/tour/index/tour/id/54 |title=The Zoo TV Tour |work=U2.com|publisher=[[Live Nation]]|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref> During a six-month break, the band recorded the album ''[[Zooropa]]'', which was released in July 1993. It was inspired by Zoo TV and expanded on its themes of media oversaturation.<ref name="zooropa" /> By the time the tour concluded in December 1993, U2 had played to approximately 5.3&nbsp;million fans.<ref>Cogan (2008), p. 154</ref> In 2002, ''Q'' magazine said the Zoo TV Tour was "still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band".<ref name="Q-int">{{cite magazine |title=10 Years of Turmoil Inside U2 |first=Tom |last=Doyle |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=2002-11|issue=196}}</ref>

The group's reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2's 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by "set[ting] themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old".<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 213</ref> [[Toby Creswell]] echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book ''[[1001 Songs]]'',  writing that the album helped U2 avoid "becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions".<ref>Creswell (2006), pp. 377<U+2013>378</ref>  A 2010 retrospective by ''Spin'' said that "U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with ''Achtung Baby''."

''Achtung Baby'' has been acclaimed as one of the greatest albums in rock history, and many publications have placed it among their rankings of the best records. Two years after the record's release, ''Entertainment Weekly'' placed it at number 28 on its list of the "100 Best CDs".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best CDs|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1993-11-05|issue=195}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' collated worldwide data in 1997 from a range of renowned critics, artists, and radio [[DJ]]s, who placed the record at number 71 in the list of the "100 Best Albums Ever".<ref>{{cite news |title=100 Best Albums Ever|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|format=''Features'' insert|date=1997-09-19}}</ref> VH1 ranked it at number 65 on their "100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll" countdown from their series ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|The Greatest]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll|series=[[The Greatest (TV series)|The Greatest]]|network=[[VH1]]|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62190|number=042|airdate=2001-01-16}}</ref> In 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the record at number 62 on its list of "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]", writing, "U2 visibly loosened up on ''Achtung Baby'', cracking jokes and even letting themselves be photographed in color".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6862/35223/35539|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2003-12-11|issue=937|accessdate=2010-04-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mRK6HHHc|archivedate=2009-12-31}}</ref> That same year, "The Definitive 200" album list<U+2014>sponsored by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<U+2014>listed ''Achtung Baby'' at number 45.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080802040323/http://www.rockhall.com/pressroom/definitive-200/ |title=Definitive 200 |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |author=[[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] |accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> The ''Q'' staff named it the third-best album from 1980<U+2013>2004,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Music That Changed the World: Top 20 Albums from 1980<U+2013>2004 |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=2004-03}}</ref> and similarly, in 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' called it the third-best album of the previous 25 years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207337,00.html |title=The New Classics: Music <U+2013> The 100 best albums from 1983 to 2008 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-06-27|accessdate=2010-06-14|issue=999<U+2013>1000}}</ref> In 2006, the record appeared on a number of lists, including ''[[Hot Press]]''{{'}}s "100 Greatest Albums Ever" at number 21,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://hotpress.com/archive/2860544.html |title=Achtung Baby (21/100 Greatest Albums Ever) |magazine=[[Hot Press]] |date=2006-04-13|accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s "The All-Time 100 Albums".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Achtung_Baby,00.html |title=The All-Time 100 Albums: Achtung Baby |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Josh |last=Tyrangiel|authorlink=Josh Tyrangiel|date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> In 2010, the record topped ''Spin''{{'}}s list of the "125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years", which ranked the most influential albums in the 25 years since the magazine launched.
