'''Gda<U+0144>sk'''([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{Audio-IPA|Gdansk.ogg|['<U+0261>da<U+0272>sk]}}), or '''Danzig'''<!-- DO NOT REMOVE, this is not intended to promote pan-German ideals, it is here to reflect its wide usage in the modern era !--> ({{Audio-de|Danzig|Danzig.ogg}}); {{lang-csb|Gdu<U+0144>sk}}, Late {{lang-la|Gedania}}; older {{lang-en|Dantzig}}; [[Names of European cities in different languages|other languages]]) is [[Poland]]'s sixth-largest [[city]], and also its principal [[seaport]] and the capital of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]].

The city lies on the southern coast of the [[Gda<U+0144>sk Bay]] (of the [[Baltic Sea]]), in a conurbation with the spa town of [[Sopot]], the city of [[Gdynia]] and [[suburb]]an communities, which together form a [[metropolitan area]] called the greater Gda<U+0144>sk or the [[Tricity]] (''Tr<U+00F3>jmiasto'') with a population of over a million people. Gda<U+0144>sk is, with a population of 458 053 (2006), the largest city in the historical province of [[Eastern Pomerania]], and present region of [[Gda<U+0144>sk Pomerania]]. West lies the Kashubian Tricity ([[Rumia]], [[Reda]], and [[Wejherowo]]), while [[Pruszcz Gda<U+0144>ski]] is to the east.

Gda<U+0144>sk is situated at the mouth of the [[Mot<U+0142>awa]] River, connected to the [[Leniwka]], a branch in the delta of the [[Vistula]], whose waterway system connects 60% of the area of Poland. This gives the city a unique advantage as the center of Poland's sea trade.

Historically an important seaport since medieval times and subsequently a principal ship-building centre, Danzig was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. The city is world famous as the birthplace of the [[Solidarity]] movement which, under the leadership of [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]], played a major role in bringing an end to [[Communist]] rule in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Today Gda<U+0144>sk remains an important industrial centre, together with the nearby port of [[Gdynia]].

==Names==
The name is thought to mean ''town located on Gdania river''{{cn}}, the original name of the Mot<U+0142>awa branch the city is situated on. Like many other European cities, Gda<U+0144>sk has had many different names throughout its history.

The Polish name '''Gda<U+0144>sk''' is usually pronounced [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|[g<U+0259><U+02C8>d<U+0251><U+02D0>nsk]}}, {{IPA|[g<U+0259><U+02C8>da<U+026A>nsk]}}, or {{IPA|[g<U+0259><U+02C8>d<U+00E6>nsk]}} in English. The acute accent is frequently neglected by non-Poles. In the local [[Kashubian language]] it is known as '''Gdu<U+0144>sk'''.

The city was mainly populated by Germans and in 1792 became a part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], later being part of the German Empire until 1919; the German name '''Danzig''' was widely used until the end of the Second World War. The city's [[Latin]] name may be given as any of '''Gedania''', '''Gedanum''' or '''Dantiscum'''; the variety of Latin names reflects the influence of the Polish, Kashubian, and German names.

Former [[English language|English]] versions of its name include '''Dantsic''' and '''Dantzic''' (in use until the end of [[World War I]]).

=== Historical documents ===
[[Image:RegiaCivitatisGedanensis.jpg|left|thumb|Danzig Royal City coin of 1589 ([[Sigismund III Vasa]] period)]]
The name of a settlement was recorded after St. Adalbert's demise in 997 A.D. as ''urbs Gyddanyzc'' and later was written as Kdanzk (1148), Gdanzc (1188), Gdansk (1236), Danzc (1263), Danczk (1311, 1399, 1410, 1414&ndash;1438), Danczik (1399, 1410, 1414), Danczig (1414), Gdansk (1454, 1468, 1484), ''Gdansk'' (1590), ''Gd<U+0105>nsk'' (1636) and in Latin documents ''Gedanum'' or ''Dantiscum''. These early recordings show the [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] name Gdu<U+0144>sk, the Polish name Gda<U+0144>sk and the German name Danzig.

Alternative spellings from [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and early modern documents are ''Gyddanyzc'', ''Kdansk'', ''Gdanzc'', ''Dantzk'', ''Dantzig'', ''Dantzigk'', ''Dantiscum'' and ''Gedanum''. The official Latin name of ''Gedanum'' was used simultaneously.

=== Special celebration names ===
On special occasions it is also known as The Royal Polish City of Gda<U+0144>sk ({{lang-pl|Kr<U+00F3>lewskie Polskie Miasto Gda<U+0144>sk}}, {{lang-de|K<U+00F6>nigliche Polnische Stadt Danzig}}, {{lang-la|Regia Civitas Polonica Gedanensis}}, [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]: ''Kr<U+00F3>lewsczi Polsczi Gard Gdu<U+0144>sk'').

The Kashubians prefer the name: Our Capital City Gda<U+0144>sk (''Nasz Stoleczny Gard Gdu<U+0144>sk'') or The Kashubian Capital City Gda<U+0144>sk (''Stoleczny Kasz<U+00EB>bsczi Gard Gdu<U+0144>sk'').

=== Foundation and the Middle Ages ===
{{POV-section}}
According to [[archaeology|archeologists]], the Gda<U+0144>sk stronghold was built in the 980s by [[Mieszko I of Poland]], after a series of local wars against the inhabiting pagans. In 1997, the year 997 was celebrated by Poland as the date of the foundation of the city, this being the year when Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]] (sent by the Polish king [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]]) baptized the inhabitants of Gda<U+0144>sk (''urbs Gyddanyzc'').

Gda<U+0144>sk soon became the main centre of a Polish splinter duchy ruled by the [[Dukes of Pomerania]]. The most famous of them, [[<U+015A>wi<U+0119>tope<U+0142>k II of Pomerania]], granted a local autonomy charter in ca. 1235 to the city, which at the time had about 2,000 inhabitants. Eleven years prior, the town had already obtained the city charter under [[L<U+00FC>beck law]] (''L<U+00FC>bisches Stadtrecht''), in 1224. The official spoken language was German.

By 1308 the city had became a flourishing trading city with some 10,000 inhabitants, but on [[November 13]] [[1308]], it was occupied and demolished by the [[Teutonic Knights]]. This led to a series of wars between the Knights and Poland, ending with the [[Peace of Kalisz]] in 1343 when the Knights acknowledged that they would hold Pomerania as an alm from the Polish king. Although it left the legal basis of their possession of the province in some doubt, the agreement permitted the foundation of the municipality in [[1343]] and the development of increased export of grain from Poland via the [[Vistula river]] trading routes.

[[Image:Stadssigill_foer_staden_Luebeck.png|150px|thumb|left|Seal of L<U+00FC>beck]]
While under the control of the Knights, the city and its trade prospered, German migration increased, and the city's name continued to show up in various forms. The city became a full member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1361, and its city seal showed, similar to that of L<U+00FC>beck, a  "[[cog (ship)|Hansekogge]]" ship, with the inscription ''SIGILLUM BURGENSIUM DANTZIKE'' (approx. ''Seal of the Citizens of Dantzik'').

A new war broke out in 1409, ending with the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410), and the city briefly came under the direct overlordship of the Polish king. A year later, with the [[Peace of Toru<U+0144> 1411|Peace of Toru<U+0144> (Thorn) in 1411]], it returned to the Teutonic Knights' administration. In 1440 Danzig participated in the foundation of the [[Prussian Union]] which eventually led to the [[Thirteen Years War]] (1454-1466) and the [[Peace of Toru<U+0144> 1466|incorporation]] of [[Royal Prussia]] by the crown of Poland, with the prerequisite of autonomy for western Prussia.
[[Image:Danzig.Christoph Hartknoch.JPG|thumb|250px|Danzig in the 17th century]]
In 1457 Danzig with other [[Hanse]] cities became city republics with self-government. Recognized by the Royal charters granted by king [[Casimir IV the Jagiellonian]] and the free access to all Polish markets, Danzig became a large and prosperous seaport and city. The 16th and 17th centuries were a Golden Age for trade and culture of the city. Beside the German majority, there were a variety of minorities that made up the population - Poles, [[Jews]], and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. The Dutch were the largest minority. In addition, a number of [[Scotsmen]] took refuge or emigrated to and received citizenship in Danzig and other Prussian cities (see links below) and also, through trade, all over the Baltic region. With the [[Reformation]], the German inhabitants adopted the [[Lutheran]] confession, which also became the norm in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The city suffered a slow economic decline due to the wars in the 18th century, when it was taken by the Russians after the [[Siege of Danzig]] in 1734. Danzig was annexed to Prussia in 1793 and remained a part of Prussia - later within Germany - until 1919.  The exception was for several years, from 1807-1815, when it was the [[Free City of Danzig]], as arranged by France amidst the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. As part of Prussia, its longest serving Regierungspr<U+00E4>sident was [[von Blumenthal|Robert von Blumenthal]], who held office from 1841, before the troubles of 1848, until 1863. Danzig became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871.

=== World Wars and inter-war years ===
As a result of the [[Versailles treaty]] after [[World War I]], Danzig became a free city under the control of the [[League of Nations]]. Its predominantly German population had no right of self-determination in a referendum as in other disputed parts of the former [[German Empire]]. When Poland regained its independence after [[World War I]], the Poles hoped to regain the city to provide the free access to the sea which they had been promised by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] on the basis of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s "[[Fourteen Points]]". However, since the population of the city was predominantly German, it was not placed under Polish sovereignty, but became the [[Free City of Danzig]], an independent quasi-state under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]], governed by its predominantly German residents but with its external affairs largely under Polish control. The Free City issued its own stamps and currency, bearing the legend "''Freie Stadt Danzig''" and symbols of the city's maritime orientation and history.

The vast majority of the city's population favoured eventual return to Germany. In the early 1930s the [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party capitalized on these pro-German sentiments, and in 1933 garnered 38 percent of vote for the Danzig ''Volkstag''. Thereafter, the Nazis under the [[Bavaria]]n [[Gauleiter]] [[Albert F<U+00F6>rster]] achieved dominance in the city government - which, nominally, was still overseen by the League of Nations' High Commissioner.

Nazi demands, at their minimum, would have seen the return of Danzig to Germany and a one kilometer, state-controlled route for easier access across the Polish Corridor, from [[Pomerania]] to Danzig (and from there to [[East Prussia]]).<ref>See ''Documents Concerning the German Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939.'' See also the Soviet archieved, ''Documents Relating to the Eve of the Second World War'' Volume II: 1938-1939 (New York: International Publishers), 1948.</ref>  Originally, the Poles had rejected this proposal, but later appeared willing to negotiate (as did the British) by August.<ref>See ''Documents Concerning the German Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939'' See also the Soviet archieved, ''Documents Relating to the Eve of the Second World War'' Volume II: 1938-1939 (New York: International Publishers), 1948.</ref>  By this time, however, Hitler had [[Molotov Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet backing]] and had decided to attack Poland. Germany feigned an interest in diplomacy (delaying the ''[[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]]'' deadline twice), to try to drive a wedge between Britain and Poland.<ref>See ''Documents Concerning the German Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939''. Hitler's change of position is well reflected in Goebbel's personal diary.

The military assault at Danzig began with an artillery bombardment of Polish positions at the [[Westerplatte]] peninsula by the old German [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|pre-Dreadnought]] [[battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]''  and a subsequent landing of German infantry on the peninsula. Polish defenders at the Westerplatte resisted for nearly a week, before running out of ammunition. Many members of Danzig's Polish and [[Kashub]] population were deported to [[Stutthof concentration camp]] near Danzig or were executed at [[Pia<U+015B>nica]] forest.

[[Image:Sonderstempel2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|"Danzig is German" Post stamp issued by Nazi Germany to celebrate the annexation of Danzig by the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]].]]

The city was annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] and incorporated into the [[Reichsgau]] [[Danzig-Westpreussen]].

The Wehrmacht designated Danzig as Hauptsitze, Wehrkreis XX, under the command of General de Infanterie [[Bodewin Keitel]]. It's primary operational unit was the XX Infanterie Korps, and the XXXXVII Panzer Korps. Danzig was the Home Station of the 60th Panzer Grenadier Division, and the 21st Infanterie Division. Danzig was responsible for Sub-Area Headquarters at [[Wejherowo|Neustadt in Westpreussen]], [[Starogard Gda<U+0144>ski|Preussisch Stargard]], [[Kwidzyn|Marienwerder]], [[Grudzi<U+0105>dz|Graudenz]], [[Bydgoszcz|Bromberg]], and [[Toru<U+0144>|Thorn]].

Most of the [[Jewish community]] in Danzig was able to escape from the [[Nazis]] shortly before the outbreak of hostilities. However, German secret police had been observing Polish circles since 1936, compiling information which in 1939 served to prepare conscription  lists of Poles to be arrested or executed in [[Operation Tannenberg]]. After the Nazi invasion, massive arrests of Poles started.{{fact}} On the first day of the war alone approx. 1,500 people were arrested{{fact}}, mainly Poles active in the social and economical life, activists and members of Polish organizations.[http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/museums.htm] On [[2 September]] [[1939]], 150 of them were deported to [[Stutthof concentration camp]], where most were eventually killed{{fact}}.

As the war turned against Germany, German populations in Eastern Europe took flight from the advancing [[Red Army]], resulting in a great population shift. After the final Soviet offensive began in [[January]], [[1945]], hundreds of thousands of German refugees, many of whom had fled to Danzig by foot from [[East Prussia]] (see [[evacuation of East Prussia]]), tried to escape through the city's port in a large-scale evacuation that employed hundreds of German cargo and passenger ships. Some of the ships were sunk by the Soviets, including the ''[[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|Wilhelm Gustloff]]'', after an evacuation was attempted at neighboring [[Gdynia]]. In the process, tens of thousands of refugees were killed. 

The city also endured heavy Allied and Soviet bombardment. Those who survived and could not escape encountered the [[Red Army]]. On [[30 March]] [[1945]], the Soviets captured the city and left it in ruins [http://www.gdansk.pl/en/article.php?category=453&article=926&history=453:]. After the [[Yalta conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] conferences, Gda<U+0144>sk was assigned to Poland, along with all other territories east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. The remaining [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|German residents of the city who survived the war were expelled to the western zones of remaining Germany]], and henceforth the city became wholly Polish populated.

=== Modern age ===
[[Image:P4054828.JPG|thumb|left|Example of the Hanseatic style buildings recreated in the Old Town after the world war.]]
Poles came to the city from throughout Poland, especially from the regions of eastern Poland annexed by the [[Soviet Union]]. The Old City was rebuilt during the 1950s and 1960s. Because of the development of its port and three major shipyards, Gda<U+0144>sk was a major shipping and industrial center of the [[Communist]] [[People's Republic of Poland]].

In the course of German-Polish reconciliation policies driven by [[West Germany|West German]] [[Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', German territorial claims on Gda<U+0144>sk (and all other formerly German territories now under Polish administration) were renounced, and its full incorporation into Poland was recognized in the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty]] of [[Warsaw]] in 1970.

In 1970 Gda<U+0144>sk was the scene of anti-government demonstrations which led to the downfall of Poland's communist leader [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gomu<U+0142>ka]]. Ten years later the [[Gda<U+0144>sk Shipyard]] was the birthplace of the [[Solidarity]] trade union movement, whose opposition to the government led to the end of communist party rule (1989). Solidarity's leader [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]] became [[President of the Republic of Poland|President of Poland]] in 1990. Today Gda<U+0144>sk is a major industrial city and shipping port.
{{wide image|Panorama-Gda<U+0144>ska-Grodzisko.jpg|1600px}}<br clear="left">

Throughout its history Gda<U+0144>sk/Danzig faced various periods of rule from different states before 1945:
* 997-1308: [[Poland]] 
*1308-1466: [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]]
*1466-1793: [[Poland]] under special statute 
*1793-1805: [[Kingdom of Prussia]]
*1807-1814: [[Free City of Danzig]]
*1815-1871: Kingdom of Prussia
*1871-1918: [[German Reich]] ([[German Empire]])
*1918-1939: Free City of Danzig 
*1939-1945: [[Nazi Germany]]
*1945-Present: Poland

From the early [[13th century]] until 1945 the vast majority of Danzig's population had been of German ethnicity and German had been the language officially spoken since its city charter was granted in 1224 under [[L<U+00FC>beck Law]]. For example, in the course of a poll executed in 1923, 96% of the citizens of Danzig stated German to be their mother tongue whereas 3% stated Polish to be so. Danzig enjoyed far reaching privileges concerning its self-autonomy (e.g. laid down in the [[Second Peace of Toru<U+0144>]]) while it was under protection of the [[Polish Crown]] between 1466 - 1793. Due to its mainly German population the city resisted the [[Counter-Reformation]] and stayed predominantly [[Protestantism|Protestant]] until 1945.  In 1945, the surviving German population was expelled to the western parts of Germany and the city was eventually re-populated by Poles, many which had been expelled from [[Polish lands annexed by the Soviet Union|territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]].

==Economy==
[[Image:250px-GD022003_ubt.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Poseidon|Neptune]] statue at the Old Town.]]

The city's industrial landscape is dominated by shipbuilding, petrochemical and chemical industries, and food processing. The share of high-tech sectors such as electronics, telecommunications, IT engineering, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals is on the rise. [[Amber]] processing for the local economy is also important.

Gda<U+0144>sk was once an important centre of culture. In the 16th century it hosted Shakespearean theatre on foreign tours, and the [[Danzig Research Society]] founded in 1743 was one of the first of its kind. Currently, there is a ''Fundation Theatrum Gedanensis'' aimed at rebuilding the Shakespeare theatre at its historical site. It is expected that Gda<U+0144>sk will have a permanent English-language theatre, as at present it is only an annual event.

==Main sights==
The city boasts many fine buildings from the time of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Most tourist attractions are along or near Ulica D<U+0142>uga (Long Street) and D<U+0142>ugi Targ (Long Market), a pedestrian thoroughfare lined by buildings reconstructed in historical (primarily 17th century) style and capped on either end by elaborate city gates. This part of the city is sometimes referred to as the Royal Way because it was the procession route of visiting kings.

Contemporary Gda<U+0144>sk is the capital of the Pomeranian province and is one of the major centres of economic and administrative life in Poland.
