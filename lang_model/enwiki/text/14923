'''Shekhawati''' ([[Hindi]]: <U+0936><U+0947><U+0916><U+093E><U+0935><U+093E><U+091F><U+0940>, [[IAST]]: ''{{unicode|<U+015A>ekh<U+0101>w<U+0101><U+1E6D><U+012B>}}'') is a [[semi-arid]] historical region located in the northeast part of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. Its name originated from the [[Shekhawat]] [[Rajput]]s.

It mostly encompasses the administrative districts of [[Jhunjhunu]] and [[Sikar]]. It is bounded on the northwest by the [[Jangladesh]] region, on the northeast by [[Haryana]], on the east by [[Mewat]], on the southeast by [[Dhundhar]], on the south by [[Ajmer region|Ajmer]], and on the southwest by the [[Marwar]] region. However, some parts of the Churu and Nagaur districts are also considered in the Shekawati region.

Its area is 13784 square kilometers.<ref name=" Taknet, D. K ">Taknet, D.K, Marwari Samaj Aur Brijmohan Birla, Indian Institute of Marwari Entrepreneurship, Jaipur, 1993 p 78 ISBN 81-85878-00-5</ref> The inhabitants of Shekhawati are considered brave, sacrificing and hard working people. The region provides the highest number of people to the Indian Army. The region of Shekhawati is also known as "Scotland of India" because of its brave, sacrificing and painstaking Jat-Rajput people who are ancient rulers and military men.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Etymology of Shekhawati==
Shekhawati was first mentioned in the book ''Bankidas ki Khyat''.<ref>Mukutji: Jaipur rajya ka bhugol, page 46-47</ref> Contemporary of Bankidas was Colonel W.S.Gardener, who used the word Shekhawati in the year 1803. Later Colonel [[James Tod]] wrote the first history of Shekhawati. The term Shekhawati was used frequently in ''Vamsh Bhaskar''. This suggests that the term Shekhawati came in use about two and half centuries ago.<ref name="Sahiram 1952">Sahiram: Ek adh<U+016B>r<U+012B> kr<U+0101>nti, Shekhawati k<U+0101> kis<U+0101>n <U+0101>ndolan (1922-1952), page-1</ref>

Shekhawati derives its name from the [[Rajput]] [[Kachhwaha]] chieftain Rao [[Shekha Ji]]. The descendants of Rao Shekha Ji, the ruling clan is called [[Shekhawat]]. The story of Shekha's birth is interesting to understand the origin of Shekhawati. Mokal Ji and his wife were troubled as they had no son for several years. They heard about the miraculous powers of the Sheikh Burhan, a Muslim saint, and they decided to visit him. After they received the Sheikh's blessing a son was born to the couple. In honour of the mendicant, the couple named their son Shekha.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Shekhawati means Garden of Shekha or Land of [[Shekhawat]] Rulers.

Hakim Yusuf Jhunjhunuvi gives another view about the origin of the word Shekhawati. According to him, Shekhawati derives its name from a [[Persian language|Persian]] word Sheekh, which means "Sand deposited on the coastal area of sea". This indicates that this area has been inundated with seawater long ago and converted to [[sand dunes]] over thousands of years<ref name="Sahiram 1952"/><ref>Hakim Yusuf Jhunjhunuvi: Jhunjhunu ka Itihasa, Vol III page-10</ref><ref>Mansukh Ranwa 'Manu', Amar Shaheed Lotu Jat, J C Ranwa Prakashan, Sikar, 2001 p-13</ref> It is not clear when these seas dried up and receded, but the desert was created due to the receding of the sea.

Millions of years ago this land was inundated with sea water,<ref>Devi Singh Mandawa: Shardul Singh Shekhawat, page 17</ref><ref>Rajputane ka Uthala Samudra, page-21</ref><ref>FE Partiger: Ancient Indian historical tradition, page-260</ref> confirmed by fossils found in the area.<ref>Parmeshwar Solanki: Rajasthan marupradesh ka iti vritatmak vivechan, page 16</ref> [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha]] believed that the desert area of Rajasthan was earlier an ocean. Due to earthquakes and other climatic reasons, the seabed rose and the water receded southwards leaving behind a sand mass, which later came to be known as ''marukantar''. The presence of shells, conch, and other things found in stone in this area is evidence that this was a sea earlier.<ref name="Itihasa page 83">[[G H Ojha]]: Rajputane ka Itihasa (Part I), page 83</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">Sahiram: Ek adh<U+016B>r<U+012B> kr<U+0101>nti, Shekhawati k<U+0101> kis<U+0101>n <U+0101>ndolan (1922-1952), page-2</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Shekhawatiregion.jpg|thumb|200px|Shekhawati region of Rajasthan]]

Shekhawati is in a desert area of Rajasthan and has special importance in the history of India.

The natural climatic conditions in the region are very harsh and extreme. The temperature ranges from below {{convert|0|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in winter to more than {{convert|50|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in summer. The summer brings hot waves of air called ''loo''. Annual rainfall is at around 450 to 600&nbsp;mm. The [[groundwater]] is as deep as 200 feet (60 m), and in some places, the groundwater is [[Hard water|hard]] and salty. The people in the region depend on [[rainwater harvesting]]. The harvested rainwater from the monsoon season (during July and August) is stored in [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca]] tanks and used throughout the year for drinking purposes.<ref name="Busquet">Busquet, Carisse and Gerard ''Impressions of Rajasthan'' 2003, Editions Flammarion, ISBN 2-08-011171-X</ref> [[Bawdi]]s and [[johad]]s are traditionally constructed for storing rainfall in this arid region of [[Rajasthan]]. The bawdi is constructed in such a design that it is wide at the top and gets narrower at the bottom. The water stored in it is cool and used for drinking purposes. On average, every third year is drier than usual, and every eighth year the region experiences [[famine]]. The [[famine]] of 1899 is considered to have been the most severe. During famine years it becomes very difficult for animals to survive, and the cattle population declines drastically.

== Shekhawati dialect ==
Shekhawati is a [[dialect]] of the [[Rajasthani language]] and is spoken by about three million speakers in the [[Churu]], [[Jhunjhunu]], and [[Sikar]] districts of Rajasthan. Even though it is a very important dialect from the grammatical and literary points of view, very little work is carried out on it. In 2001 A descriptive compendium of the grammar of Shekhawati has been published.<ref>Lakhan Gusain. Shekhawati. Munich: Lincom Europa (2001) (LW/M 385)</ref> Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which make it very rich from the lexicographical point of view.
[[Word order]] is typically [[Subject<U+2013>object<U+2013>verb|SOV]] and there is an existence of [[implosives]]. The presence of high tone at [[suprasegmental]] level classify it with other [[dialects of Rajasthani]]. It has contributed a lot to the development of Rajasthani language and [[linguistics]].

Some samples in Shekhawati are:

*Kai Hoyo? <U+0915><U+0948> <U+0939><U+094B><U+092F><U+094B>? = What happened ?
*The Kai kar rieya ho? <U+0925><U+0947>  <U+0915><U+0948> <U+0915><U+0930> <U+0930><U+093F><U+092F><U+093E>  <U+0939><U+094B>?= What are you doing ?

==History==
===Ancient history===

{{main|Matsya Kingdom}}

Many historians have considered this region included in the [[Matsya Kingdom]]. [[Rigveda]] also provides certain evidences in this matter.<ref name="Itihasa page 83"/><ref>Sukh Sampati Raj Bhandari: Bharat ke deshi rajya, Jaypur rajya ka Itihas, page 3</ref> Manusmriti has called this land as 'brahmrishi desha'.<ref>Sahiram: Ek adh<U+016B>r<U+012B> kr<U+0101>nti, Shekhawati k<U+0101> kis<U+0101>n <U+0101>ndolan (1922-1952), page-3</ref>

Shekhawati region was included in 'marukantar desha' up to [[Ramayana]] period. Out of 16 [[mahajanapada]]s prior to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], only two janapadas, namely [[Avanti Kingdom|Avanti]] and the Kingdom of [[Virata]] were counted in Rajasthan area. This region was also influenced by Avanti but later on [[Nanda]]s of [[Magadha]] defeated Avanti. Historians believe that [[Maurya]]s obtained the Rajasthan from [[Nanda]]s.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), pages 30-31</ref>

In ancient times Shekhawati was not limited to the present two districts.  During the Mahabharata period it was known as [[Matsya Kingdom]] and extended to the [[Sarasvati River]]. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen. So the [[Veda]]s were supposed to be written and compiled on this very land.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>Satapatha Brahman 13/5/9</ref> During ancient times this region was divided into several [[janapada]]s. Every janapada was a free [[republic]] state. The development of janapadas in Rajasthan started with habitation of Aryan.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), page 27</ref>
The northern part of Rajasthan was known as [[Jangladesh]] ([[Bikaner]] and [[Nagaur]]) during [[Mahabharata]] period.<ref>Prithvi Singh Mehta: Hamara Rajasthan (1950), page 28</ref> and eastern part Jaipur-Alwar were called the [[Matsya Kingdom]]. [[Pandava]]s had spent one year of their vanishment in this Kingdom of [[Virata]] as their abode, to live in anonymity, after the expiry of their twelve-year long forest life.<ref name="Itihasa page 83"/> According to Vimal Charanlal, this Kingdom of [[Virata]] extended from [[Jhunjhunu]] to Kotkasim 109&nbsp;km in the north, Jhunjhunu to Ajmer 184&nbsp;km in the west, Ajmer to Banas and up to confluence of Chambal River 229&nbsp;km in the south. The capital of this Kingdom of [[Virata]] was [[Bairat]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[G H Ojha]]: Rajputane ka Itihasa (Part I), page 86</ref>

After the collapse of [[Gupta dynasty]], Shekhawati's some parts like [[Jhunjhunu]], [[Fatehpur, Shekhawati|Fatehpur]], [[Narhar]] were controlled by the [[Kaimkhani]]s, until they were defeated by Shekhawat Rajputs.

[[Kaimkhani]] is a branch emerged from [[Chauhan]]s. The first progenitor of Kaimkhanis was Karamchand, born in the family of Moterao of Chauhan clan, the ruler of [[Dadrewa]]. [[Firuz Shah Tughluq]] converted him to Islam and named him Kaimkhan. Thus his descendants were called Kaimkhani.

===Battle of Mandan===
In 1775 A.D, [[Rao Mitra Sen Ahir]] of [[Rewari]], and Piroo Khan Balochi, encouraged by the scattered Kaimkhanies of [[Jhunjhunu]], invaded Shekhawati. A battle was fought at [[Mandan]]. In this battle, Hanuat Singh and Surajmall took part and fought. [[Rao Mitra Sen Ahir]] was defeated, and Piroo Khan was killed. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Sheikhawats & their lands--page69,123 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?ei=xqGJTbGBGJHCvgPBssXiDg&ct=result&id=6T1XAAAAMAAJ&dq=ahirs+of+bikaner&q=ahir  |date=March 18, 2012 |publisher=}}</ref>

===Shekhawat Rule===

[[File:Laxmangarh Fort, Rajasthan.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Laxmangarh fort of [[Sikar]]]]
Shekhawati was established by Shekhawat Rajputs and it was ruled by them until [[India's independence]].

[[Rao Shekha]] Ji from [[Dhundhar]] established his own independent kingdom with the capital at [[Amarsar]]. He was the first independent ruler. After him, Rao Raimal, Rao Suja and Rao Lunkaran become the rulers of Amarsar. Rao Manohar succeeded his father Rao Lunkaran and founded Manoharpur later renamed [[Shahpura, Jaipur District|Shahpura]] (The present ruler of Shahpura is the Tikai of Shekhawat subclan). Shekhawats conquered the Jhunjhunu, Fatehpur, Narhar of Kaimkhanis and established their rule on them.

Shekhawati was the largest Nizamat in the state of [[Jaipur]], which is almost entirely occupied by Shekhawats. The Shekhawat chieftains of the region retained a nominal loyalty to the Kachwaha Rajput's capital state of Jaipur, who in turn honoured them with the hereditary title of [[Tazimi]] Sirdars. The rulers of the Shekhawati's Thikanas were the Shekhawat sub clan of the Kachwaha Dynasty of the Jaipur Princely State. Shekhawats was the most prominent among all the Kachawas of Jaipur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Colonel J.C. Brooke, in his book Political History of India, wrote that for the recruitment of cavalry, there is no region in India at par with Shekhawati.

====Thikanas of Shekhawati====
{{main|Thikanas of Shekhawati}}
*[[Rao Suja]]'s younger son Rajah Raisal conquered [[Khandela]] from [[Nirban]]s and succeeded as the Raja Sahib of Khandela. He had 12 sons, five of which died in battle. His seventh son Raja Girdhar succeeded as the Rajah of Khandela and his descendants are known as Girdhar Ji Ka Shekhawats.
*[[Raja Raisal]]'s eldest son, Thakur Lal Singh, was granted [[Khachariawa]]s Thikana and his son Kesari Singh founded [[Khatu]]. As Akbar called Lal Singh Lad Khan, this name became famous, and his descendants are known as ''[[Ladkhani]]''.
*[[Raja Raisal]]'s third son Rao Tirmal was the ancestor of the Rao Ji Ka sect of Shekhawats. He was granted the [[parganas]] of [[Nagore]] and [[Kasli]] (with 84 villages). Rao Daulat Singh son of Rao Jaswant Singh of Kasli, founded [[Sikar]] in 1687.
*[[Raja Raisal]]'s fifth son [[Rao Bhojraj]] received the [[Udaipurwati]] as his Jagir by his father. He was the ruler of [[Udaipurwati]] (The group of 45 villages of Udaipurwati was known as [[Pentalisa]]) and he was ancestor of the [[Bhojraj Ji Ka]] sept of Shekhawats. Descendants of Rao Bhojraj founded many Thikanas and ruled over them. [[Pentalisa]] was composed of [[Jhajhar]], [[Gudha]], [[Khirod]], etc.
*[[Thakur Shardul Singh]], a descendant of Rao Bhojraj Ji, conquered the [[Jhunjhunu]] in 1730 from the [[Kayamkhani]] Nawabs. Thakur Shardul Singh had six sons, namely, Thakur Jorawar Singh, Thakur Kishan Singh, Kunwar Bahadur Singh (died in his Kunwarpadi), Thakur Akhe Singh, [[Thakur Nawal Singh]] Bahadur and Thakur Kesari Singh. Unfortunately, Bahadur Singh died in a young age. Later on Thakur Shardul Singh's estate was divided into five equal shares among his five sons. These five shares were known as [[Panchpana]]. It was the second territory ruled by Bhojraj Ji Ka. Panchpana was composed of the Thikanas of [[Khetri]], [[Bissau]], [[Mukandgarh]], [[Nawalgarh, Rajasthan|Nawalgarh]], [[Dundlod]], [[Mandawa]], [[Taen]], [[Mahansar]], [[Alsisar]], [[Malsisar]], [[Mandrella]], [[Arooka]], [[Chowkari]], [[Hirwa]], [[Sigra]], [[Baloda]], [[Surajgarh]], etc. As Akhe Singh died his share was divided between the other brothers. Thakur Shardul Singh's sons and their descendants founded many new well planned and prosperous Thikanas. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

*Many Thikanas had their own flags and emblems. Shekhawats ruled over the largest number of Thikanas in [[Jaipur]] Rajwara.<ref>[http://www.uq.net.au/~zzhsoszy/ips/misc/shekhawat.html Shekhawat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

*In the 19th century [[Sikar]] was the largest and wealthiest Thikana and the [[Khetri]] was the second wealthiest Thikana of Jaipur State. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Culture, heritage and tourism==
===Architecture===
The [[Shekhawat]]s built forts in their [[thikanas]]. At every thikana in Shekhawati, there was a fort. More than 50 forts and palaces were built by Shekhawat Rajas. Today, many of them are hotels.
* Mandawa Fort was built by Thakur Nawal Singh Bahadur in 1755. In the zenana (women's quarters), various rooms offer different themes. One room has antique murals, another has a marble fountain, while the turret room boasts of walls that are {{convert|7|ft|m}} thick. Diwankhana, the formal drawing room, is decorated with family portraits and an array of antique armour.
* Dundlod Fort dates back to 1750 AD. Steps lead up to the Diwan Khana, which is furnished with portraits, hangings, and period furniture. It also houses a library and portraits done in the European style.
* The Roop Niwas Kothi Palace was established as a large country house by Rawal Madan Singh, former ruler of Nawalgarh. It is popularly known as Rawal Sab Ki Kothi in Nawalgarh. It sits on over {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land. The facade is painted in ochre that lends it dignity. The hotel organises horse safaris and has stables at the back side. 
* Mukundgarh Fort was built by Thakur Mukund Singh Ji. He established Mukundgarh in 1859 and the fort was built in a traditional style and spreads over {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land. It has several courtyards, overhanging balconies, arched windows and corridors.
* Narain Niwas Castle, or Mahansar Fort, was built in 1768 by Thakur Nahar Singh. It has an imposing entrance reached by flight of stairs. It also has many wall paintings.

===Havelis, temples and frescos===
[[Image:Temple in Nawalgarh.jpg|thumb|right|This temple built by [[Shekhawat]] ruler of Nawalgarh]]
[[File:Shekhawati painted houses.jpg|right|thumb|Shekhawati painted houses.]]
In Shekhawati, frescoes were initially introduced by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs in their forts and palaces. The towns in Shekhawati are known for their painted [[haveli]]s. This region has been recognised as the "open [[art gallery]] of [[Rajasthan]]" having the largest concentration of [[fresco]]s in the world.

The Marwaris from Marwar was an influential business community in Shekhawati, and they prospered until the beginning of the 19th century, due to the caravan routes that crossed the area to reach the ports of [[Gujarat]]. However, from 1820 onwards, many left their families behind and migrated to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and [[Madras]], which were gaining importance as main trade centers where they had great financial success. The descendants of these rich merchants have permanently settled down in the towns their ancestors migrated to. The Shekhawati region has produced large number of Marwaris who are dominant factor in the economy of [[India]]. About 80 percent of big industrial houses are managed by Marwaris. India's richest industrialists of the century, such as the [[Birlas]] and [[Dalmia]], are Marwaris. Today, the main trading and industrial houses of India have their roots in Shekhawati.

Between 1830 and 1930, they erected buildings in Shekhawati, their homeland, as evidence of their success. As the ultimate symbol of their opulence, the Marwaris commissioned artists to paint those buildings.

Most of the buildings of the Shekhawati region were constructed in between the 18th century and the early 20th century. During the British occupation, traders adapted this style for their buildings.<ref>Henderson, Carol D, ''Cultures and Customs of India''; Greenwood Press 1992, ISBN 0-313-30513-7, pg. 92</ref> The havelis are noted for their [[fresco]]s depicting [[mythological]] and [[historical]] themes. The frescos include images of gods, goddesses, animals, and the life of the lords [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]], profusely painted on the havelis in this region.

[[Marwaris]] have played an important role in the development of Shekhawati. Their major contribution to the Shekhawati region is in the field of education. Marwaris have also played a leading role in the [[Indian independence movement]]. They provided financial help in running the freedom movement.

==Feudalism in Shekhawati==
Feudalism functioned as an over-riding politico-administrative, social and economic formation undermining even the institution of caste. The feudal mode of social relations as a dominant force guided everyday life of the people of Shekhawati region in Rajasthan. One could trace some continuity of the past social formation in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal in the form of "semi-feudalism"as characterised by some scholars, but such a situation is not evident in present day Rajasthan, which was a prominent stronghold of feudalism prior to independence.<ref name="ReferenceA">K.L. Sharma: Caste, Feudalism and Peasantry: The Social Formation of Shekhawati, Vedams eBooks (P) Ltd. New Delhi, 1998</ref>

Today a remarkable discontinuity in distributive processes and social relations, simultaneous occurrence of the processes of upward and downward social mobility and a self-perpetuating process of social transformation could be witnessed in Shekhawati.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Farmers of Shekhawati==
The Marwaris dominate the cities and towns of Shekhawati region. The rural areas of the Shekhawati region are dominated by farming communities. The farmers of the Shekhawati region are considered to be the most advanced in the state of [[Rajasthan]], second only to farmers from Shri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Shekhawati region has the highest literacy in the state.<ref name=" Dr RP Arya, Jitendra Arya, Dr Gayatri Arya, Anshuman Arya ">Dr RP Arya, Jitendra Arya, Dr Gayatri Arya, Anshuman Arya, Rajasthan Road Atlas, Indian Map Service, Jodhpur 2005</ref>

The predominant farmer communities in the rural areas of Shekhawati are the [[Jats]]: they comprise the largest single caste in the state (9 per cent), and were, in the 1930s and even earlier, the most self-conscious and prosperous among the peasant castes. In 1935 their claims to certain privileges led to a series of clashes between them and the Rajputs, who resisted their attempts to revise accepted signs of status.<ref>[http://www.princelystates.com/Rajputana/rc-02-02x.shtml Princely States Report]</ref> The [[Rajput]] community who were the [[jagirdar]]s before independence still play very important role in society. The [[Brahman]]s and [[Dalit]]s also play an important role in the area. The farmers of the region have done great struggle to come to the present status.

Before independence, the farmers of the Shekhawati region were exploited and oppressed by the [[Jagirdar]]s during [[British Raj]]. During that time, Jagirdars would burden farmers, known as Kisans, with various taxes, a large part of which was to be paid to the British government.<ref name="Dr Natthan Singh">Dr Natthan Singh, ''Jat-Itihas'', (Jat History), [[Jat Samaj Kalyan Parishad]], F-13, Dr Rajendra Prasad Colony, Tansen marg, Gwalior, M.P, India 474 002 2004</ref>
