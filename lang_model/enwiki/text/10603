The '''Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus''' or '''"Great" Ludovisi sarcophagus''' is an [[ancient Roman sarcophagus]] dating to around 250<U+2013>260 AD from a tomb near the [[Porta Tiburtina]]. It is also known as the '''Via Tiburtina Sarcophagus''', though other sarcophagi have been found there. It is known for its densely populated, anti-[[classicism|classical]] composition of "writhing and highly emotive"<ref>Fred S. Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'' (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010, enhanced ed.), p. 272.</ref> [[ancient Romans|Romans]] and [[Goths]], and is an example of the battle scenes favored in [[Roman art]] during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].<ref>Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art,'' p. 272.</ref> Discovered in 1621 and named for its first modern owner, [[Ludovico Ludovisi]], the sarcophagus is now displayed at the [[Palazzo Altemps]] in [[Rome]], part of the [[National Museum of Rome]].<ref>Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 178.</ref>

The sarcophagus is a late outlier in a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, the others all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group, and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.<ref>Strong, Donald, et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), ISBN 0300052936</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Grande Ludovisi sarcophagus 03.JPG|thumb|Detail of the central figure, his forehead marked with an X]]
The sarcophagus measures 1.53m in height and is made from [[Proconnesian marble]], a [[List of artistic media|medium]] characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain.<ref>Frances Van Keuren, Donatio Attanasio, John J. Hermann Jr., Norman Herz, and L. Peter Gromet, "Multimethod Analyses of Roman Sarcophagi at the Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome," in ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 181.</ref> It is decorated in a very [[high relief]] with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, but here the battle continues round both sides. 

The lid of the sarcophagus depicts barbarian children handed over to a Roman general by men presumably their fathers.<ref>Jeannine Diddle Uzzi, "The Power of Parenthood in Official Roman Art," in ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), p. 76.</ref> Children were sometimes taken into Roman custody as pledges of peace, and might be reeducated as Romans. The lid, which was broken in 1945 while on display in [[Mainz]], also shows a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of a female figure.

The central figure of the tortuous composition on the front is a young Roman military commander on horseback, presumed to represent the deceased. His face is serene, and his arm is extended confidently in a "gesture which is difficult to interpret but seems to be one of farewell".<ref>Strong, Donald, et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 257, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), ISBN 0300052936</ref> An X-mark on his forehead has been interpreted as the cross received by initiates into the [[Mithraic mysteries]] as a sign of the god Mithras' favor. The Mithraic religion was popular among Roman soldiers. The valor ''([[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]])'' shown by the horseman may represent real-life bravery on the battlefield, but the religious connotation of the X may suggest victory over death, a theme of mounted warriors in funerary art. The horseman probably represents the deceased.<ref>Katherine Welch, "Roman Sculpture," in ''The Oxford History of Western Art'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 51; Linda Maria Gigante, "Funerary art," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 250<U+2013>251.</ref>

The figure is sometimes identified as the younger son of the emperor [[Decius]], [[Hostilian]], who reigned briefly in the year 251. Decius and his older son, [[Herennius Etruscus|Herennius]], whom he had made his co-ruler, were killed [[Battle of Abritus|in battle]] against a federation of [[Scythians#Migration_period|Scythians]] under the command of the [[Goths|Gothic]] king [[Cniva]]. They were the first [[Roman emperor]]s to die in battle at the hands of a foreign enemy. Despite the battle imagery, Hostilian himself died of plague.<ref>Tony Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome'' (Duncan Baird, 2005), p. 52.</ref>

The sarcophagus contains many precise depictions of military details such as the ''[[Draco (military standard)|draco]]'' military standard and a detailed [[Mail (armour)|mail shirt]] of the longer length characteristic of the period.<ref>Pat Southern and Karen R. Dixon, ''The Late Roman Army'' (Yale University Press, 1996), pp. 98, 126.</ref>

==Technique and style==
The undercutting of the deep relief exhibits virtuosic and very time-consuming drill work that conveys chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. It differs from earlier battle scenes on sarcophagi in which more shallowly carved figures are less convoluted and intertwined.<ref>Welch, "Roman Sculpture," in ''The Oxford History of Western Art,'' p. 41; Mackay, ''Ancient Rome,'' p. 178.</ref>  Describing it as "the finest of the third-century sarcophagi", art historian Donald Strong says:<ref>Strong, Donald, et al., ''Roman Art'', 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 257, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), ISBN 0300052936</ref>

<blockquote>the faces are strikingly unclassical, and the technique of deep drilling is particularly obvious in the manes of the horses and the shaggy hair of the barbarians.  But the main difference [to the [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], a similar 2nd century work] is in the symbolism.  The barbarians all seem frozen in the moment before disaster and death overwhelm them; their attitudes are highly theatrical but none the less immensely expressive... The main theme is no longer the glorification of military prowess but that of transcending the struggle, presumably conveying the notion of triumph over death ... The ugliness of pain and suffering is stressed by the dishevelled hair, the tormented eyes, the twisted mouth.</blockquote>

Differences in scale between the figures, though present, are far less marked than in the earlier Portonaccio sarcophagus, with the general here only slightly larger than his troops or enemies. Nor is the general seen wearing a helmet or in actual combat, as in the earlier sarcophagi.<ref>Strong, 257</ref>

From the time of the [[Antonine dynasty|reign of the Antonine emperors]], Roman art increasingly depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes emphasizing dehumanized barbarians subjected mercilessly to Roman military might, at a time when in fact the [[Roman Empire]] was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to [[fall of the Roman Empire|the fall of the empire in the West]].<ref>Patrick Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome,'' p. 371; Allan, ''Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome,'' p. 52.</ref> Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves.<ref>Coleman, "Barbarians: Artistic Representations," p. 371.</ref>
