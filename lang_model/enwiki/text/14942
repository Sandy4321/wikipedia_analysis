'''Hirotoki Onozawa''' (<U+5C0F><U+91CE><U+6FA4><U+5B8F><U+6642>) (born March 29, 1978 in [[Shimada, Shizuoka]], [[Japan]]) is [[rugby union]] who plays at wing (and sometimes [[Full back (rugby union)|full back]]) [[Suntory Sungoliath]] and the [[Japan national rugby union team]]. He is nicknamed "the eel" for his sharp sidestepping ability. Onozawa is the joint most capped Japanese rugby player of all time, and is the fourth highest try scorer in international rugby and despite spending much of his career in the shadow of [[Daisuke Ohata]] he is considered an all time great of Japanese rugby in his own right.

== Career ==

Onozawa made his debut for Japan against {{nrut|Wales}} in June 2001 and immediately impressed troubling the Welsh defence throughout and scored a try from 75 metres out from a move that he started himself. From there onwards he became a fixture in the Japan side.

He scored 8 tries in his first 7 caps playing as a full back, but in 2003 he started playing wing instead. He played at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in all of Japan's matches, and scored in his first match against {{nrut|Scotland}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxHcSLhQRLU|title=Hirotoki Onozawa try vs Scotland 2003 RWC }}</ref> and his wing partnership with [[Daisuke Ohata]] at the tournament was noted as big threat .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/oct/13/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion1|title=Rusty Scots get shock therapy from Japan}}</ref>

In the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], Onozawa again played in all Japan's matches and notably scored a 70 metre individual try against {{nrut|Wales}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HogEU8lWil8|title=Hirotoki Onozawa try vs Wales 2007 RWC}}</ref> After retaining his place in the side after the tournament, Onozawa gradually kept increasing his try scoring record and by 2011 he entered the top 10 on the all time international try scoring list.

At the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], Onozawa played in all Japan's matches for a third consecutive tournament, and also scored against {{nrut|New Zealand}} to become the 15th player to score in a three World Cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysport.co.nz/article/rugby-union/2011-rugby-world-cup/match-stats-all-blacks-v-japan-49352/|title=MATCH STATS: ALL BLACKS V JAPAN}}</ref>

Despite new coach [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]] making big changes to the squad after [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] resigned, Onozawa survived the post World Cup clearout to continue to play under his sixth Japan head coach. And 2012 proved to be one of his most successful years, he scored his 50th international try in May 2012 again {{nrut|Hong Kong}} to reach 4th highest on the all time try scoring list, and overall scored 10 tries in 8 matches, including tries in Japan's first ever wins away in Europe against {{nrut|Romania}} and {{nrut|Georgia}} in November.

Into his 12th year of his international career in 2013, Onozawa won his 80th cap against {{nrut|Fiji}} to become the most capped Japanese player of all time, overtaking centre [[Yukio Motoki]]'s total of 79 caps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japonrugby.net/hirotoki-onozawa-devient-le-joueur-le-plus-cape-.php|title=Hirotoki Onozawa devient le joueur le plus cap<U+00E9>!}}</ref>

At domestic level, Onozawa has played his entire professional career with [[Suntory Sungoliath]] who he joined in 2000. He played and scored a try in their famous win over {{nrut|Wales}} in 2001, 2 weeks before his test debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1367212.stm|title=Red-faced Wales slump to tour defeat}}</ref> Since the [[Top League]] was launched in 2003, Onozawa has been named in the Team of the Season at the end of season awards for all but two of the first 10 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-league.jp/award/persona2012.html|title=<U+500B><U+4EBA><U+8868><U+5F70> 2012-13}}</ref> He was the top try scorer in the league in [[2009-10 Top League|2009/10]] and [[2010-11 Top League|2010/11]] seasons,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-league.jp/award/persona2009.html|title=<U+500B><U+4EBA><U+8868><U+5F70> 2009-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-league.jp/award/persona2010.html|title=<U+500B><U+4EBA><U+8868><U+5F70> 2010-11}}</ref> and in [[2007-08 Top League|2007/08]] he was named the league's overall MVP for the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-league.jp/award/persona2007.html|title=<U+500B><U+4EBA><U+8868><U+5F70> 2007-08}}</ref> In October 2012 Onozawa became the first player to score 100 tries in the [[Top League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofjapan.com/sport/rugby-onozawas-100th-try-helps-suntory-stay-unbeaten|title=Onozawa's 100th try helps Suntory stay unbeaten}}</ref>
