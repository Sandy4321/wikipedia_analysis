Del Rey was born in New York City in 1986 and was raised in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]]. At age fifteen, she was sent to boarding school in Connecticut, before moving to New York City at eighteen to study [[metaphysics]] at [[Fordham University]]. While attending the university, according to Del Rey: "that was when my musical experience began. I kind of found people for myself".<ref name="Vogue bio">{{cite web|uel=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/lana-del-rey|title=Lana Del Rey Biography, Quotes and Facts|last=Sowray|first=Bibby|date=February 10, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2012|work=[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]}}</ref> After her uncle taught her how to play [[guitar]], she realized that she could probably write "a million songs with those six chords".<ref name="bbclovelaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16729651|title=Love, the law, and Lana Del Rey|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2012|publisher=BBC News. [[BBC]]}}</ref> She then began performing in clubs in New York City, using various [[stage names]] such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena. According to Del Rey: "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn <U+2013> I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point <U+2013> and that was it". At 20 years old, Del Rey signed a $10,000 recording contract and moved to a trailer park outside of New York City. The album that she recorded was later shelved, "causing her to shift her focus". Instead, she began work in [[community service]] and for the next five years worked at homeless outreach, drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers.<ref name="Vogue bio"/>

A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by [[David Kahne]]. With the label, she released the three-track EP ''Kill Kill'' in October 2008 and a full-length studio album ''[[Lana Del Ray A.K.A.

"Video Games" was co-written by Del Rey and Justin Parker, with production helmed by [[Robopop]].
