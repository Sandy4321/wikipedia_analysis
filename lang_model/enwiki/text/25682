'''Black Arrow''', officially capitalised '''BLACK ARROW''',<ref name="Gibson">{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Chris|coauthors=Buttler, Tony|title=British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets & Missiles|publisher=Midland Publishing|location=England|date=2007|edition=2007|isbn=1-85780-258-6}}</ref> was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[satellite]] [[carrier rocket]]. Developed during the 1960s, it was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971. Its final flight was the first successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom, and placed the [[Prospero X-3|Prospero]] satellite into [[low Earth orbit]].<ref name="VE"/>

Black Arrow originated from studies by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] for carrier rockets based on the [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] rocket,<ref name="Millard"/> with the project being authorised in 1964. It was initially developed by [[Saunders-Roe]], and later [[Westland Aircraft]] as the result of a merger.

Black Arrow was a three stage rocket, fuelled by [[RP-1]] [[kerosene|paraffin]] and [[high test peroxide]], a [[concentration|concentrated]] form of [[hydrogen peroxide]].<ref name="timeshift"/> It was retired after only four launches in favour of using [[United States|American]] [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] rockets, which the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.<ref name="cancellation"/>

==Development==
Black Arrow originated from a Royal Aircraft Establishment proposal for a rocket capable of placing a {{convert|144|kg|adj=on}} payload into [[low Earth orbit]], in order to test systems designed for larger spacecraft. In the autumn of 1964, the programme was authorised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[ministry of Aviation|Aviation Minister]] [[Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh|Julian Amery]], however following a [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|general election]] in October, the incoming [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government put the project on hold to reduce expenditure.<ref name="F4">{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701717/session4.html|title=Session 4|work=Black Arrow: British Rocket Science and the Cold War|publisher=Science Museum|accessdate=2009-03-09<!--|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025154109/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701717/session4.html|archivedate=2007-10-25-->}}</ref>

Following another [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|election]], the government approved the continuation of the programme with several modifications, including the reduction of the test programme from five to three launches. The first launch was set for 1968.<ref name="F5">{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701717/session5.html|title=Session 5|work=Black Arrow: British Rocket Science and the Cold War|publisher=Science Museum|accessdate=2009-03-09<!--|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607170555/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701717/session5.html|archivedate=2007-06-07-->}}</ref>

Most of the technology and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the Black Knight rocket, or the [[Blue Steel missile]].<ref name="Millard"/> Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible in order to reduce costs, and simplify the development process.<ref name="VE"/>

Initial development was conducted by Saunders-Roe, which merged into Westland Aircraft in 1964. Westland was subsequently the prime contractor for the Black Arrow, and assembled the first and second stages at [[Cowes|East Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. [[Bristol Siddeley]] produced the first and second stage engines at a factory in [[Ansty, Warwickshire|Ansty]], [[Warwickshire]]. The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight, where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at [[High Down]].<ref name="HighDown">{{cite web|url=http://www.hengistbury-head.co.uk/highdown.htm|title=High Down, Isle of Wight|last=Rees|first=Bill|publisher=Hengistbury Head: An Introduction|accessdate=2009-03-09<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hTKIvlyc|archivedate=2009-06-12-->}}</ref> [[Bristol Aerojet]] produced the third stage in [[Somerset]], while the [[Explosives Research and Development Establishment]] produced its [[solid-fuel rocket|solid propellent]] in [[Waltham Abbey, Essex|Waltham Abbey]], [[Essex]].<ref name="Millard"/> The [[Rocket Propulsion Establishment]], based in [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire|Westcott]], [[Buckinghamshire]], was responsible for the design and integration of the stage.<ref name="Millard">{{cite book|last=Millard|first=Douglas|title=The Black Arrow Rocket: A History of a Satellite Launch Vehicle and its Engines|publisher=Science Museum|location=London|date=2001|isbn=1-900747-41-3}}</ref>

The name ''Black Arrow'' came from the [[Ministry of Supply]] policy of assigning designations consisting of a colour and a noun, unofficially known as [[List of Rainbow Codes|Rainbow Codes]], to research programmes conducted by the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].<ref name="Gibson"/>

==Vehicle==
[[Image:BlackArrowCR2.svg|55px|thumb|left|Cutaway diagram, showing the positions of fuel and oxidiser tanks, engines, and the third stage inside the fairing.]]
The first and second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 paraffin, burnt using high test peroxide as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidiser]].<ref name="timeshift"/> Due to the lower volumetric [[specific energy]] of hydrogen peroxide than that of many other oxidisers, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems.<ref name="EA-Prop">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/props/h2oosene.htm|title=H2O2/Kerosene|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the [[Center of mass|centre of gravity]] and make the rocket easier to control.<ref name="Millard" /> This arrangement had been pioneered by [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], whereas the [[Soviet Union]] had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, making it easier for the lower tank to be filled first.<ref name="Soyuz">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/soyuz.htm|title=Soyuz|last=Wade|first=Mark|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>

[[Thrust vectoring]] was used to provide attitude control on the first two stages.<ref name="Millard"/> The eight first stage [[combustion chamber]]s were arranged in pairs which could [[gimbal]] either way along one axis.<ref name="Millard"/> Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided [[flight dynamics|roll, pitch and yaw]] control.<ref name="Millard"/> The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axis, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a [[reaction control system]].<ref name="Millard"/> The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead [[spin-stabilisation|spin-stabilised]].<ref name="VE"/>

The first stage was powered by a single [[Bristol Siddeley Gamma|Gamma 8]] engine, which burned for 127 seconds.<ref name="VE"/> The Gamma 8 was an eight-chamber engine, derived from the Gamma 301 engine used on the Black Knight. It was {{convert|6.9|m}} long, and had a diameter of {{convert|2|m}}, the same diameter as the [[France|French]] [[Coralie (rocket)|Coralie]].<ref name="VE"/> Coralie was used as the second stage of the [[Europa (rocket)|Europa]] rocket, and the decision to give Black Arrow the same diameter as Coralie was taken in order to make it compatible with [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]], which was used as the first stage of Europa.<ref name="VE">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=C. N.|title=A Vertical Empire: The History of the UK Rocket and Space Programme, 1950-1971|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|date=2001|edition=2006|pages=155<U+2013>188|chapter=Black Arrow|isbn=1-86094-268-7}}</ref> This would have allowed Black Arrow's payload capacity to have been increased, and would also have allowed Britain to use the first stage of Black Arrow as a backup to the Coralie.<ref name="UKSpace-diagram">{{cite web|url=http://spaceuk.org/ba/ba_dimensions.htm|title=BA Sectional|publisher=Space UK|first=C.

The first and second stages were connected by an [[interstage]] structure containing four [[Siskin IB]] [[separation motor|separation]] and [[ullage motor]]s, which separated and ignited seven seconds after the first stage had cut off.<ref name="Millard"/><ref name="SpaceUK-Solids">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceuk.org/solids/solidsdata.htm|title=Solid Fuel Motors|last=Hill|first=C.

The second stage, which was {{convert|2.9|m}} long and measured {{convert|1.37|m}} in diameter, was powered by a two-chamber Gamma 2 engine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/photos/missilespacesystemscutaways/royal-aircraft-establishment-black-arrow-cutaway-9670.aspx|title=Gamma 2 Engine|work=Royal Aircraft Establishment Black Arrow Cutaway|publisher=Airspace|accessdate=2009-03-04<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hTKSnpsw|archivedate=2009-06-12-->}}</ref> which ignited shortly after the separation motors, and continued to burn for 123 seconds.<ref name="VE"/> Three minutes after launch, during the second stage burn, the [[payload fairing]] separated.<ref name="VE"/>

[[Image:Black Arrow 2.jpg|thumb|left|The first two stages and open payload fairing of R4 on display at the Science Museum in London.]]
About 257 seconds into the flight, the second stage cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to [[apsis|apogee]].<ref name="VE"/> Immediately after cut-off, the second stage attitude control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained by means of the attitude control system.<ref name="VE"/> Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was be spun up to a rate of 3&nbsp;hertz (180&nbsp;rpm) by means of six [[Imp (rocket engine)|Imp]] rockets.<ref name="VE"/> Five seconds later, the third stage separated,<ref name="Millard"/> and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a [[Waxwing (Rocket motor)|Waxwing]] solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds. <ref name="VE"/>

Just over a minute after the third stage had burned out, the payload was released, and [[gas generator]]s were used to push the spacecraft and spent upper stage apart.<ref name="VE"/> The delay between burnout and separation was intended to reduce the risk of [[recontact]] between the upper stage and payload due to residual thrust. Despite this, following spacecraft separation on the R3 launch, the upper stage collided with the Prospero satellite,<ref name="VE"/> damaging one of the spacecraft's communications antennae;<ref name="Parkin">{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975JBIS...28..263P|title=The performance of Black Arrow in the launch of the Prospero satellite (Abstract)|last=Parkin|first=L.

Although none was ever built, several derivatives of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity.<ref name="VE"/> One proposal added eight [[Raven (rocket engine)|Raven]] solid rocket motors from the [[Skylark (rocket)|Skylark]] programme to the first stage as [[booster rocket]]s.<ref name="Millard"/> Another suggestion was to mount the entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile,<ref name="VE"/> while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful [[Larch (rocket engine)|Larch]].<ref name="Millard"/>

Four Black Arrows were launched between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with [[Battleship (rocketry)|battleship]] third stages and a [[boilerplate (rocketry)|boilerplate]] payload. On the first flight an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harland|first=David M.|coauthors=Lorenz, Ralph D.|title=Space Systems Failures|editor=Mason, John; Whyte, Alex|publisher=Springer-Praxis|location=Berlin|date=2005|edition=2006|pages=97<U+2013>98|isbn=0-387-21519-0}}</ref> Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by [[range safety]].<ref name="Once">{{cite video|people=Stracy, Mathew; Myerscough, Joe|title=Once We Had A Rocket|url=http://www.space.co.uk/DataBank/VideoGallery/OnceWeHadARocket/tabid/682/Default.aspx|format=flv|medium=Documentary|publisher=Space.co.uk|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and [[atmospheric re-entry|re-entered]] over the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].<ref name="UKSpace">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceuk.org/ba/ba.htm|title=Black Arrow|publisher=SpaceUK|first=C.

The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character [[Prospero]] in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/6133/blackarrow.html|title=Black Arrow|first=Stephen|last=O'Brien|publisher=Britain in Space|accessdate=2009-03-09|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hTL2hFDA|archivedate=2009-06-12}}</ref> Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name="timeshift">{{cite episode|title=British Space Race|series=Timeshift|network= [[BBC]]|station= [[BBC Four]]}}</ref>

All four launches were conducted from [[Woomera Launch Area 5|Launch Area 5B]] at the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]] in [[Australia]], which had previously been used as a test site for the [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] rocket. During the development programme, launch sites in [[Barbados]], [[Uist]] and [[Norfolk]] were also considered.<ref name="VE"/> The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an [[oil platform|oil rig]] in the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceuk.org/ba/northsea.htm|title=North Sea|work=Black Arrow|publisher=SpaceUK|first=C.

The [[Department of Trade and Industry|Minister of State for Trade and Industry]], [[Frederick Corfield]], announced the cancellation of the Black Arrow project in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 29 July 1971. As the R3 rocket had already been shipped to the launch site, the second stage having arrived three days earlier, permission was given for it to be launched.<ref name="VE"/>

The programme was cancelled on economic grounds, as the Ministry of Defence decided that it would be cheaper to use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar payload capacity, for future launches.<ref name="cancellation">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceuk.org/ba/blackarrowcancellation.htm|title=Black Arrow Cancellation|publisher=Space UK|first=C.
