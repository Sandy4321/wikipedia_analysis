'''HSC ''Hellenic Wind'' ''' (yard number 6000) is a [[high-speed craft]] (HSC) owned by [[Hellenic Seaways]], having previously being owned by Sea Containers.

==Isle of Man Steam Packet Company==
[[Image:Superseacat2.jpg|left|thumb|''SuperSeaCat Two'' in previous SPC livery, 2007]]
She first entered services between [[Dover]] and [[Calais]] for [[Sea Containers Ltd|Sea Containers]] subsidiary [[Hoverspeed]] in 1997, named HSC ''SuperSeaCat Two'' before moving to the [[Irish Sea]] in 1998 primarily for service between [[Liverpool]] and [[Dublin]] but also for Isle of Man Steam Packet services between [[Liverpool]] and [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. The vessel returned to [[Hoverspeed]] in 1999 to reopen the [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]-[[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] route which had been closed by [[P&O Stena Line]] earlier that year. Her place on the Irish Sea was taken by her sister, [[HSC SuperSeaCat Three|''SuperSeaCat Three'']].

In 2000, she once again sailed on the Irish Sea, this time between [[Heysham]] and [[Belfast]] but again returned to Hoverspeed this time for service between Dover and Calais or Ostend operating alongside 2 of her 3 sisters.  After spending some time laid up in [[Portsmouth]] she returned to service on the Newhaven-Dieppe run before being chartered to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, which had by then been sold by Sea Containers. 

In May 2008, it was announced that the Steam Packet Company had purchased ''Incat 050'' (now ''Manannan''), and it would replace ''Viking'' from the 2009 season. At the end of the 2008 season, ''Viking'' sailed to Alexandra Dock in Liverpool to lay-up for the winter. In January 2009, ''Viking'' left drydock to cover the passenger sailings of ''Ben-my-Chree'',<ref>http://www.steam-packet.com/SteamPacket/Important+Information+(News)/Latest+News+18.12.08.htm</ref> which had gone into drydock for propeller repairs. After ''Ben-my-Chree'' returned to service, ''Viking'' returned to lay-up in Liverpool.

==Atlantico Line==
''Viking'' was expected to depart from Liverpool for her Azores charter to Atlantico Line around 5<U+2013>6 July. A side-loading door that was fabricated in Portsmouth was fitted. She did not leave until 23 July due to a leak that was found when her fuel tanks were being filled for her long voyage. The port side of ''Viking'' has lost the  web address, <U+201C>steam-packet.com<U+201D> due to re-painting following the insertion of the side-loading vehicle door. During the voyage her hull was damaged due to weather and docked at [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] for repairs. She finally arrived in the [[Azores]] and began service on the morning of 5 August. Steam Packet masters are believed to be accompanying the ship for training purposes and then to act as the representatives. 

==Hellenic Seaways==
''Viking'' was sold to [[Hellenic Seaways]] renamed ''Hellenic Wind'' in September 2009.<ref> http://www.irishseashipping.co.uk/news/2009/06_2009/06_2009.htm</ref>
