'''Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[grammarian]] and [[Neoplatonist]] [[philosopher]] who flourished c. 430 AD.

==Life and Works==

Macrobius was of African descent. He may be identical with a Macrobius who is mentioned in the [[Codex Theodosianus]] as a [[Prefect#Praetorian prefects|praetorian prefect]] of [[Spain#Roman Empire|Spain]] in 399-400, proconsul of Africa in 410, and lord chamberlain in 422, although he has also been identified with a Theodosius who served as praetorian prefect of Italy in 430. The fact that Christianity is not mentioned in any of his writings, despite the predominance it now asserted in every aspect of Roman life, coupled with his vigorous interest in pagan rituals, leaves scholars in no doubt as to his religion: Macrobius was undoubtedly a pagan, and his ''Saturnalia'', with its idolisation of Rome's pagan past, has been described as a pagan "machine de guerre"<ref name="pagan">{{cite journal | author=Alan Cameron| title=Macrobius, Avienus, and Avianus| journal=The Classical Quarterly| year=1967| volume=17| issue=2| page=385-399}}</ref>. Macrobius was thus one of the last pagan writers of Ancient Rome.


===Saturnalia===

The most important of his works is the ''Saturnalia'', containing an account of the discussions held at the house of [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] (c. 325-385) during the holiday of the [[Saturnalia]]. It was written by the author for the benefit of his son Eustathius (or Eustachius), and contains a great variety of curious historical, mythological, critical and grammatical discussions. There is but little attempt to give any dramatic character to the dialogue; in each book some one of the personages takes the leading part, and the remarks of the others serve only as occasions for calling forth fresh displays of erudition.

The first book is devoted to an inquiry as to the origin of the Saturnalia and the festivals of [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]], which leads to a history and discussion of the Roman calendar, and to an attempt to derive all forms of worship from that of the Sun. The second book begins with a collection of ''bons mots'', to which all present make their contributions, many of them being ascribed to [[Cicero]] and [[Augustus]]; a discussion of various pleasures, especially of the senses, then seems to have taken place, but almost the whole of this is lost. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth books are devoted to [[Virgil]], dwelling respectively on his learning in religious matters, his rhetorical skill, his debt to [[Homer]] (with a comparison of the art of the two) and to other Greek writers, and the nature and extent of his borrowings from the earlier [[Latin]] poets. The latter part of the third book is taken up with a dissertation upon luxury and the sumptuary laws intended to check it, which is probably a dislocated portion of the second book. The seventh book consists largely of the discussion of various physiological questions.

The primary value of the work lies in the facts and opinions quoted from earlier writers. The form of the ''Saturnalia'' is copied from [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium'' and [[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]]'s ''Noctes atticae''; the chief authorities (whose names, however, are not quoted) are Gellius, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, [[Plutarch]] (''Quaestiones conviviales''), [[Athenaeus]] and the commentaries of [[Maurus Servius Honoratius|Servius]] and others on Virgil.

===Scipio's Dream===

Macrobius is also the author of a commentary in two books on the ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'' narrated by Cicero at the end of his ''Republic''. The nature of the dream, in which the elder Scipio appears to his (adopted) grandson, and describes the life of the good after death and the constitution of the universe from a [[stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Neo-Platonic]] point of view, gave occasion for Macrobius to discourse upon the nature of the [[cosmos]], transmitting much classical philosophy to the later Middle Ages.  Of a third work ''On the Differences and Similarities of the Greek and Latin Verb'', we only possess an abstract by a certain Johannes, doubtfully identified with [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (9th century).

See editions by [[L. von Jan]] (1848-1852, with bibliog. of previous editions, and commentary) and [[Franz Eyssenhardt]] (1893, [[Teubner]] text); on the sources of the ''Saturnalia'' see [[H. Linke]] (1880) and [[G. Wissowa]] (1880). The grammatical treatise will be found in Jan's edition and [[H. Keil]]'s ''Grammatici latini'', v.; see also [[Georg Friedrich Sch<U+00F6>mann|GF Sch<U+00F6>mann]], ''Commentatio macrobiana'' (1871).
