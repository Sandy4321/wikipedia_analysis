'''Mercer Drake''' is one of the main characters in the American comic book series [[Negation (comics)|Negation]] published by [[CrossGen Entertainment]].  

==Character details==

Mercer Drake is from the same area of space as Obregon Kaine. He was a famous pirate even before getting his sigil <U+2013> indeed he gloried in being known as the most wanted man in the Kazrath system. He was captured as part of an experiment by Negation forces to test the power levels of those from the "bright universe". All Drake knew at first though was that he<U+2019>d woken up one morning on a strange planet with 99 other individuals.

When Komptin, the leader of the local Negation forces, brought all the surviving prisoners inside the prison, Drake was one of the few people that Kaine brought into his escape plans. The eventual uprising led to several of the prisoners reaching a Negation spaceship. Halfway through loading people on board, the auto-launch was triggered leading to a premature departure of the ship. Mercer Drake was one of the only eleven people to get on board.

The stolen prison transport ship was attacked by Negation fighters. Drake used his powers to survive in space, to literally jump onto one of the ships and pull the pilot out! Using that ship, he destroyed the other, but was injured in the process. After partially recovering, Drake and the others were surprised to find some of their fellow captives from the prison world had also escaped. Eventually, after a few misunderstandings were resolved, the two groups merged.

==Sigil-bearer==

[[Obregon Kaine]] remarks that the Sigils basically make you more of what you already are. In Drakes case he was a thief and pirate essentially his Sigil allows him to "get" whatever he wants. Drake has also demonstrated super strength and agility.
