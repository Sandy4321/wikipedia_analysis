'''Julius Kambarage Nyerere''' ([[April 13]], [[1922]] - [[October 14]], [[1999]]) was the first President of Tanzania, and previously [[Tanganyika]], from the country's founding in [[1964]] until his retirement in [[1985]]. Born in Tanganyika to a local Zanaki chief called Nyerere Burito, Julius Nyerere was known by the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name ''Mwalimu'' or 'teacher' because of his profession before becoming active in politics.

==Education==
Nyerere began attending Government Primary School in [[Musoma]] at the age of 12 where he completed the 4 years program in 3 years and went on to Tabora Boys Government Secondary School. He received a scholarship to attend [[Makerere University]], (at that time it was the only tertiary education institution in East Africa), where he obtained a teaching Diploma. He returned to [[Tanganyika]] and worked for 3 years at St. Mary<U+2019>s Secondary School in Tabora, where he taught Biology and English. In 1949 he got a scholarship to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] (he was the first Tanzanian to study at a British university and only the second to gain a university degree outside Africa) where he obtained his Masters of Arts Degree on Economics and History in 1952. In [[Edinburgh]], partly through his encounter with [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] thinking, Nyerere began to develop his particular vision of connecting socialism with African communal living.

==Political career==
On his return to Tanganyika, Nyerere took a position teaching History, English and Kiswahili, at St. Francis' College, near [[Dar es Salaam]]. In 1953 he was elected president of [[Tanganyika African Association]] (TAA), a civic organisation dominated by of civil servants, that he had helped found while a student at Makerere University. In 1954 he transformed TAA into the politically oriented [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU). TANU's main objective was to achieve national sovereignty for Tanganyika. A campaign to register new members was launched, and within a year TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country.<ref>[http://www.dailynews-tsn.com/page.php?id=6395 Happy Birthday Mwalimu], ''Daily News (Dar es Salaam)'', April 13, 2007</ref><ref name=Britannica_black>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9056571 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica's Guide to Black History: Julius Nyerere]</ref> 

Nyerere's activities attracted the attention of the Colonial Authorities, and he was forced to make a choice between his political activities and his teaching. He was reported as saying that ''he was a schoolmaster by choice and a politician by accident.'' He resigned from teaching and traveled throughout the country speaking to common people and tribal chiefs, trying to garner support for movement towards independence. He also spoke on behalf of TANU to the Trusteeship Council and Fourth Committee of the [[United Nations]] in New York. His oratory skills and integrity helped Nyerere achieve TANU goal for an independent country without war or bloodshed. The cooperative British governor [[Sir Richard Turnbull]] was also a factor in the struggle for independence. Nyerere entered the Colonial Legislative council in 1958 and was elected chief minister in 1960. In 1961 Tanganyika was granted self governance and Nyerere became its first Prime Minister on [[December 9]] [[1961]]. A year later Nyerere was elected President of Tanganyika when it became a Republic. Nyerere was instrumental in the union between the islands of [[Zanzibar]] and the mainland [[Tanganyika]] to form [[Tanzania]], after a coup in Zanzibar in 1964 toppled [[Jamshid bin Abdullah of Zanzibar|Jamshid bin Abdullah]], who was the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]].

==Economic Policies==
[[Image:Muungano.JPG|thumb|right|Symbolic mixing of Soils from Zanzibar and Tanganyika in 1964]]
When in power, Nyerere implemented a socialist economic program (announced in the [[Arusha Declaration]]), establishing close ties with [[People's Republic of China|China]], and also introduced a policy of collectivization in the country's agricultural system, known as ''[[Ujamaa]]'' or "familyhood".

Although some of his policies can be characterized as socialist, Nyerere was first and foremost an African, and secondly a socialist. He was what is often called an [[African socialism|African socialist]]. Nyerere had tremendous faith in rural African people and their traditional values and ways of life. He believed that life should be structured around the ''ujamaa'', or extended family found in traditional Africa. He believed that in these traditional villages, the state of ''ujamaa'' had existed before the arrival of [[imperialist]]s. 

He believed that Africans were already, recently, socialists, all that they needed to do was return to their traditional mode of life and they would recapture it. This would be a true repudiation of capitalism, since his society would not rely on capitalism to exist. This ''ujamaa'' system failed to boost agricultural output and by 1976, the end of the forced collectivization program, Tanzania went from the largest exporter of agricultural products in Africa to the largest importer of agricultural products in Africa. Politically and socially the declaration was hugely unpopular. It was a failure and only plunged Tanzania into further debt, a crisis in its balance of payments deficits and worsened relations with international donors.

With the realisation that the Tanzanian economy did not flourish and being unwilling to lead Tanzania using an economic model he did not believe, Nyerere willingly announced that he would retire after presidential elections in 1985, leaving the country to enter its free market era under the leadership of [[Ali Hassan Mwinyi]].  

Nyerere was instrumental in putting both Ali Hassan Mwinyi and [[Benjamin Mkapa]] in power. He remained the chairman of [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (ruling party) for five years following his presidency until 1990, and is still recognised as the '''Father of the Nation'''.

==Foreign Policy==

Nyerere was one of the African Leaders during the Pan-African movement that swept the continent in the 1960's. 
He was a larger-than-life person, a seemingly uncorruptable individual and a committed [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-africanist]]. Nyerere was also one of the founders of the [[Organization of African Unity]] in [[1963]]. Nyerere provided a home for a number of African liberation movements including the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the [[Pan African Congress]] (PAC) of South Africa, [[FRELIMO]] when it sought to overthrow Portuguese rule in [[Mozambique]], and [[ZANLA]] (and [[Robert Mugabe]]) in its struggle to unseat the white regime in Southern [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). From the mid 1970s, along with President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]], he was an instigator and leader of the "[[Front Line States]]", which provided uncompromising support for the campaign for [[Black Majority Rule]] in [[South Africa]]. In 1978 he led Tanzania into war against Uganda, then under the dictatorship of [[Idi Amin]], resulting in the defeat of [[Uganda]] and the exile of Idi Amin. He also was instrumental in the coup in [[Seychelles]], which brought [[France-Albert Ren<U+00E9>]] to power.
Nyerere's foreign policy emphasized [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the [[Cold War]], and under his leadership, Tanzania enjoyed friendly relations with both the [[Western world|West]] and the [[Eastern bloc|East]].

Outside of Africa, Nyerere was an inspiration to [[Walter Lini]], Prime Minister of [[Vanuatu]], whose theories on [[Melanesian socialism]] owed much to the ideas he found in Tanzania, which he visited. Lecturers inspired by Nyerere also taught at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]] in the 1980s, helping educated [[Melanesia]]ns familiarise themselves with his ideas.

Unfortunately, many believe that his socialist policies were directly responsible for the Hutu uprisings against the Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi and played the major role in the ongoing sectarian genocides in that region.

His unwavering support for Robert Mugabe also likely contributed to the extreme misery in Zimbabwe that was caused by that prolonged dictatorship.

==After the Presidency==
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Nyerere0kofi.jpg|thumb|right|Nyerere with [[Kofi Annan]]]] -->
After the Presidency, Nyerere remained the Chairman of CCM until 1990 when [[Ali Hassan Mwinyi]] took over. Nyerere remained vocal about the extent of corruption and corrupt officials during the [[Ali Hassan Mwinyi]] administration. He also blocked [[Jakaya Kikwete]]'s nomination for the presidency, citing that he was too young to run a country. Nyerere was instrumental in getting [[Benjamin Mkapa]] elected (Mkapa had been Minister of Foreign Affairs for a time during Nyerere's administration).

In one of his famous speeches during the CCM general assembly, Nyerere said in Swahili '''''"Ninang'atuka"''''', meaning that he was pulling out of politics for good. He moved back to his childhood home village of Butiama in western Tanzania. During his retirement, he continued to travel the world meeting various heads of government as an advocate for poor countries and especially the [[South Center]] institution. Nyerere travelled more widely after retiring than he did when he was president of Tanzania. One of his last high-profile actions was as the chief mediator in the Burundi conflict in 1996. He died in a London hospital of leukaemia on October 14, 1999.

===Positions Held after Presidency===
* 1985-1990 Chairman of [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]]
* 1987-1990 Chairman of the independent International South Commission.
* 1990-1999 Chairman, South Center, Geneva & Dar es Salaam Offices.

===Beatification inquiry===
In January [[2005]], the Catholic diocese of [[Musoma]] opened a cause for the [[beatification]] of Julius Nyerere. Nyerere was a devout [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] who attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] daily throughout his public life and was known for [[fasting]] frequently.
