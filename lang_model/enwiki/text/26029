<onlyinclude> <!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below -->
This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Belize''' which consists of the mainland of [[Belize]] and around 450 [[Geography of Belize|smaller cays and islands]] lying in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The avifauna of Belize includes a total of 618 species, of which 4 are globally threatened and 3 have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans. </onlyinclude>

This list's [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of [[James Clements|Clements]]'s 5th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflects this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total species counts for Belize. 

The following tags have been used to highlight certain relevant categories. It must be noted that not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring, native species.
*(A) '''Accidental''' A species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Belize.
*(I) '''Introduced''' A species introduced to Belize as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions.

'''Order''': [[Tinamiformes]] 
'''Family''': [[Tinamidae]]

[[Image:Tinamus major.JPG|thumb|right|Great Tinamou]]
The tinamous are one of the most ancient groups of bird. Although they look similar to other ground-dwelling birds like quail and grouse, they have no close relatives and are classified as a single family Tinamidae within their own order, the Tinamiformes. They are distantly related to the [[ratites]] (order [[Struthioniformes]]), that includes the [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]]s, [[emu]], and [[kiwi]]. There are 47 species worldwide and 4 which occur in Belize.
