===Personal life===
Clay Aiken was born and raised in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]]. As a young boy, Aiken sang in the [[Raleigh Boychoir]] and as a teenager, he sang in school choirs, church choir, musicals and local theatre productions.<ref>Aiken, Clay. ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]''. (2004), p. 250, ISBN 1-4000-6392-2</ref> After high school, he sang lead with a local band, Just By Chance,<ref>Woerner, Tom.

He was also emcee and performer at the Johnston Community College Country Showcase in [[Smithfield, North Carolina|Smithfield, NC]], and at the North Carolina Music Connection and Hometown Music Connection shows in [[Garner, North Carolina|Garner]] and [[Benson, North Carolina|Benson]], NC. He performed the national anthem numerous times for the Raleigh Ice Caps and the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].<ref>Aiken, Clay. ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]''. (2004) p. 249-251, ISBN 1-4000-6392-2</ref> Three demo albums of Aiken's vocals were created before ''American Idol'' with the aid of studio time given as a birthday gift by his mother: a cassette called ''Look What Love Has Done'' (by Clayton Grissom), a cassette and CD entitled ''Redefined''<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Clay+Aiken/Redefined "Redefined track listing."] last.fm.

Retrieved 2007-06-21.</ref> (by Clay Aiken).

Aiken attended Raleigh's [[Leesville Road High School]] and took courses at [[Campbell University]] before enrolling at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]]. He found his interest in special education while directing [[YMCA]] children's camps as a teenager, and at age 19, he served as a substitute teacher for a classroom of students with [[autism]] at Brentwood Elementary School in Raleigh. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child's mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for ''[[American Idol]]''. Although his ''American Idol'' activities temporarily delayed his academic pursuits, Aiken completed his course work while on tour and graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[special education]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2003-12-21-aiken-graduates_x.htm "'American Idol' star Clay Aiken graduates."] ''USA Today''.

His middle name came from his paternal grandmother's maiden name; using instead the married surnames of their mothers, he and Foster followed that tradition in choosing their son's name.

===American Idol===
Aiken had filled out an application to participate in the reality show ''[[Amazing Race]]'' when a friend of his insisted that he try out for ''American Idol'' instead.<ref>Bronson, Fred. ''The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits''. Billboard Books. ISBN 0823076776.</ref> Television viewers first glimpsed Aiken during the audition episodes at the beginning of ''American Idol's'' second season. The show's judges first saw Aiken as a [[nerd]]y type unlikely to be any kind of idol, but after hearing him sing  [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]]'s "Always and Forever" decided to advance him to the next round. The clip of the judges' surprise during this audition performance was replayed many times over the course of the competition.

Aiken made it to the round of 32 before being cut from the show, but he was invited to return for the "Wild Card" round (note, the format of this round has changed drastically since Aiken's season); his performance of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]" sent him on to the final 12 as the viewer's choice. While noted for his performance of ballads, such as [[Neil Sedaka]]'s "[[Solitaire (song)|Solitaire]]", his upbeat performances, including [[The Foundations]]' "[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]", were also appreciated. Aiken received enough votes every week to keep him out of the bottom three. Part of his appeal was his "geek to chic" transformation in appearance. "I looked like [[Opie Taylor|Opie]],"  Aiken said to [[People (magazine)|People magazine]] regarding his appearance at his [[American Idol]] [[audition]] in 2002.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/clay_aiken/photos/0,,20007361_679890,00.html "People Photo Album, Then and Now"].

On May 21, 2003, Aiken came in a close second to Studdard, who won the contest by 134,000 votes out of more than 24,000,000 votes cast. The result was controversial, as some hypothesized that ''Idol'''s voting system was incapable of handling the number of attempted calls.<ref>Seibel, Deborah Starr.

Since I'm neither one of those, people are completely concerned about me."<ref>Hedegaard, Erik and Jenny Eliscu. "New kid on the block." ''Rolling Stone''. New York. July 10, 2003.

Aiken made a surprise appearance on the final show of [[American Idol (season 5)|American Idol season 5]], when failed auditioner Michael Sandecki returned to the show to receive a "Golden Idol" award for Best Impersonator for his Clay Aiken-like appearance.

He has appeared multiple times on ''[[The Tonight Show]],'' interviewing with [[Jay Leno]] as a guest in addition to singing, and has become a regular guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]].'' The Kimmel appearances often feature skits: in one Kimmel's then girlfriend [[Sarah Silverman]] confessed to an affair with Aiken, and in another, Aiken expressed his distaste for Kimmel's jokes about him by beating him up.  In May 2007, he spent the first half of his interview on horseback while talking about his recent UNICEF trip to Afghanistan. A few weeks later he appeared as a spokesperson for "Guillermo's Mustache" in Kimmel's fictional DVD informercial shown on the ''[[Dancing With the Stars]]'' finale.

===Tours===
From February through April 2004, Aiken and [[Kelly Clarkson]] embarked on the "Independent Tour" as co-headliners. Following this tour, he was scheduled for a few summer solo tour dates, but demand ultimately led to the booking of fifty dates across the United States, resulting in what many fans called the "Not-a-Tour". [[Disney]] was the exclusive sponsor of this summer tour, promoting their ''[[Aladdin (1992 film)|Aladdin]]'' Special Edition 2-Disc DVD with a preview of Aiken's rendition of "Proud of Your Boy", a song originally intended for the first release of the film but cut when the Aladdin storyline changed during production. A music video featuring Aiken is on the ''Aladdin'' Special Edition DVD. On this tour, he also performed a duet, "Without You," which was released on [[Kimberley Locke]]'s 2004 debut album [[One Love (Kimberley Locke album)|''One Love'']].

In November 2004, Aiken launched his third tour of the year, which revolved around a [[Christmas]] theme. "The Joyful Noise Tour", sponsored by Ronald McDonald House Charities, featured a conductor and a 30-piece orchestra. In some cities, Aiken was supported by the local philharmonic or symphony, such as the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]]. Local choirs from high schools and elementary schools also participated at each concert.

A 23-date tour in support of his third album, ''[[A Thousand Different Ways]],'' began on July 4, 2007 and ended in [[Orlando, Florida]] on August 19. On this tour Aiken hired local symphonies to back him, along with tour regulars Jesse Vargas, pianist, conductor and arranger; Sean McDaniel, drummer; and Quiana Parler and Angela Fisher, backup singers. Three days into the tour, Aiken and a woman were involved in an in-flight altercation in which she allegedly shoved him. As a result of the scuffle, Aiken and the woman were later questioned by the FBI.<ref name="Tulsa World">[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070707_1__Forme25775 "Aiken apparently questioned after airplane incident."] ''Tulsaworld.com''.

=== Faith and philosophy===
In 2004 Aiken made the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]], debuting at #2, with his "inspirational memoir" titled ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]'', written with Allison Glock, and published by [[Random House]]. Barely mentioning ''American Idol'', in the book he instead turned his focus to the people who had the most influence in his life <U+2014> his mother, grandparents, siblings, teachers, and friends&mdash;and to the importance of religion in his life.  

While not self-identified as a Christian music artist, Aiken was featured in ''[[EMF Broadcasting|Christian Music Planet]]'' as an "American Idol Christian" in 2004,<ref>[http://www.christianmusicplanet.com/magazine/viewarticle.asp?id=356 "American Idol Christians" in "2004 in Review".] ''Christian Music Planet''. January 2005. Archived, searchable.</ref> and in a cover story, "Clay Aiken's Balancing Act," in the January/February 2005 issue.<ref>Argyakis, Andy. [http://www.christianmusicplanet.com/magazine/?id=18 "Clay Aiken's Balancing Act."] ''Christian Music Planet''. January/February 2005. Archived, subscription required.</ref> His pre-Idol demo albums included several selections of contemporary Christian music (known as [[Contemporary Christian Music|CCM]]) and gospel songs. A performance of the [[Commodores]]' "Jesus is Love" at the American Music Awards in 2003  earned Aiken and [[Ruben Studdard]] a standing ovation. Aiken has sung a few CCM songs at his pop concerts, and has made Christmas albums, Christmas television specials and performances, and Christmas tours essential elements of his career. 

He described himself in ''Learning to Sing'' as a proud [[Southern Baptist]] who had journeyed away from those roots in his late teens in search of a religion with more liberal social policies, and then returned to that church because of family and social ties although he remains at odds with the church on some issues.<ref>Aiken, Clay. ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]'' (2004), pp. 221-230, ISBN 1-4000-6392-2.</ref> When asked in a PBS Kids interview to name his idols, he responded, "When people ask me what three people I<U+2019>d like to have dinner with, living or dead, I say [[Jesus Christ]], [[Fred Rogers|Mr. Rogers]], and [[Jimmy Carter]]."<ref name="pbskids">[http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/celebs/interviews/clay2.html "It's My Life."] pbskids.org. October, 2003. Retrieved 2007-06-24.</ref>

Aiken makes it clear that he is aware not everyone shares his religious beliefs and it is not his intention to press these beliefs on others. When he worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA, he challenged other camp faculty by insisting that singing "overtly Christian songs" was inappropriate, as some of the kids were Jewish. "I stood firm... no child is going to have a spiritual crisis on my watch."<ref>Aiken, Clay. ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]'' (2004), pp. 228, ISBN 1-4000-6392-2.</ref> His public philosophy, geared towards inclusion and service to others, reflects his stance that decisions about religion should be made at home.<ref>[http://www.thebubelaikenfoundation.org "Bubel/Aiken Foundation."]</ref><ref>Aiken, Clay. ''[[Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life]]'' (2004), pp. 227-229, ISBN 1-4000-6392-2.</ref>

Aiken has donated his time and his voice to multiple benefit events and concerts, including the 2004 [[Rosalynn Carter]] Benefit, the America's Promise Benefit, and [[Heather Headley]]'s [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]] benefit, "Home," where he sang a duet with Headley.<ref>[http://www.broadwaycares.org/templatesecondary.cfm?FileName=home2004.html/ "Heather Headley: Home."] broadwaycares.org.

===The Bubel/Aiken Foundation===
Aiken has been a dedicated advocate for education and for children's causes. His interest in [[autism]] issues led him, along with Diane Bubel (whose son Michael is diagnosed with autism and was tutored by Aiken), to found the [[Bubel Aiken Foundation|Bubel/Aiken Foundation]], which supports the integration of children with disabilities into the life environment of their non-disabled peers. The BAF runs summer camps which reflect its mission,<ref>[http://www.bubelaiken.org/default.aspx?tabid=106 Bubel/Aiken Foundation, "Let's ALL Play."] Retrieved 2006-06-23.</ref> and also presents Able to Serve awards to support the volunteer efforts of children with physical and mental disabilities.<ref>[http://ysa.org/PartnersSponsors/tabid/61/Default.aspx#thebubel/aikenfoundation/ "Youth Service America, Partners & Sponsors."] Retrieved 2006-06-23.</ref> In July 2005, Raleigh's [[WRAL-TV]] reported on an internet campaign mounted by critics questioning how Aiken's foundation used its money. WRAL news hired an independent accountant who reported that program services totaled $920,000 in 2004<U+2014>around 85 cents on every dollar donated<U+2014>which is considered a solid percentage compared to other charities.<ref>[http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/118557/ "Clay Aiken's Nonprofit Group Comes Under Critic Scrutiny."] WRAL.com.

===UNICEF===
In November, 2004, Aiken was appointed a [[U.S. Fund for UNICEF]] National Ambassador, with a mission to help ensure that children everywhere are afforded a [[primary education]].<ref name="unicef"/> After the [[tsunami]] at the end of 2004, he participated in the [[WNBC|NBC4]] telethon, which raised over $10 million, and recorded [[public service announcement]]s in support of South Asian tsunami relief. He later recorded a video, featuring the song "[[Give a Little Bit]]", to be used as a [[public service announcement]] to raise money for tsunami victims.  He was the 2005 spokesperson for the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF drive.<ref>Shultz, Susan. [http://www.acorn-online.com/news/exec/view.cgi/22/6741 "'Idol' surprises Middlesex."] ''The Darien Times''.

Aiken has made five trips for UNICEF. In March 2005, he went to the tsunami-stricken [[Banda Aceh]] area to raise awareness of the need to restore education quickly to the children who survived this disaster.<ref>[http://www.unicefusa.org/site/c.duLRI8O0H/b.254949/k.2A6C/Clay_Aiken__Profiles__Celebrity_Ambassadors__Who_We_Are__US_Fund_for_UNICEF.htm ''US Fund for UNICEF website'', Aiken page].</ref> UNICEF sent Aiken on another mission in May 2005, to northern [[Uganda]], to witness the plight of children called "night commuters", who flee the villages each night to sleep in streets and shelters in hopes of avoiding being kidnapped by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]. UNICEF sent him to [[Kabul]] and [[Bamyan]] in [[Afghanistan]] in April 2007, where he was able to spend time with children in their classrooms; he also visited a health center for women and children where he administered oral polio vaccinations to babies. He observed that Afghani children, after being forbidden for so many years by the [[Taliban]] regime to attend school, are eager to return to school now that they are once again allowed to receive an education.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/afghanistan_39401.html "UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Clay Aiken visits Afghanistan."] unicef.org.
