'''Mark Warwick Fordham Speight''' (6 August 1965&nbsp;<U+2013> 7 April 2008)<ref name="mailonsunday">{{cite news |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/femail/article-1068093/Drugs-death-despair-How-death-TV-presenter-Mark-Speights-fiancee-sparked-spiral-tragedy.html |title=Drugs, death and despair: How death of TV presenter Mark Speight's fiancee sparked a spiral of tragedy |last=Cable |first=Amanda |work=[[The Mail on Sunday]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]]|date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2008-10-04}}</ref> was a British television presenter, best-known for presenting the long-running [[BBC]] children's art programme ''[[SMart]]''. Speight grew up in [[Tettenhall]], [[Wolverhampton]], and left school at 16 to become a cartoonist. He took a degree in [[Commercial art|commercial]] and [[graphic design|graphic art]] and, while working in television [[set construction]], heard of auditions for a new children's art programme. Speight was successful in his audition and became one of the first presenters of ''SMart'', working on it for 14 years.

Speight was also a presenter on ''[[See It Saw It]]'', where he met his future fianc<U+00E9>e [[Natasha Collins]]. He took part in live events, such as ''[[Rolf on Art]]'' and his own ''Speight of the Art'' workshops for children. He was involved in charity work; he became the president of the [[Muscular Dystrophy Campaign]]'s Young Pavement Artists Competition, and was a spokesperson for [[ChildLine]].

In January 2008, Speight found the body of Collins in the bath of their London flat. He was arrested on suspicion of her murder, but not charged with any offence. An inquest later determined Collins had died of a drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April, Speight was reported missing and was found hanged near [[Paddington Station]] a few days later; two suicide notes were discovered, describing how he could no longer live without Collins.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Speight was born in [[Seisdon]], [[Staffordshire]], and grew up in [[Tettenhall]], near [[Wolverhampton]]. His father, Oliver Speight, is a property developer, and his mother, Jacqueline Speight, was an art teacher.<ref name="guardobit">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/14/television|title=Mark Speight|accessdate=2008-09-24|date=2008-10-05|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Armstrong |first=Stephen}}</ref> Jacqueline died on 5 September 2008, aged 62, from a [[stroke]] allegedly brought on by the stress of her son's death.<ref name="mail">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052936/Stress-kills-mother-tragic-TV-star-Speight.html |title='Stress' kills the mother of tragic TV star Mark Speight |last=Self |first=Alistair |date=2008-09-07 |work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref> Speight attended the [[Independent school (UK)|independent school]] [[Tettenhall College]] for a year, before moving  to [[Comprehensive school|state comprehensive]] Regis School, now known as King's School, at the age of 12.<ref name="obit">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7346112.stm | title=Obituary: Mark Speight | work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=BBC | date=2008-04-14 | accessdate=2008-09-24 }}</ref> Speight stated in an interview he was a slow learner at school, with a short attention span, and art was a way for him to communicate.<ref name="guardobit" /> He said he did "very badly" because he was a victim of bullying, and the "daily ordeal for two years" forced him to become the "class joker". Speight left aged 16 and went on to attend Bilston Art School, where he took a degree in commercial and graphic art.<ref name="midland">{{cite news | last = Parkes | first = Diane | title = Telly star Mark a victim of bullies | work = icBirmingham | publisher = Midland Newspapers | date = 2005-09-16 | url =http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/campaigns/tm_headline=telly-star-mark-a-victim-of-bullies%26method=full%26objectid=16138532%26siteid=50002-name_page.html | accessdate = 2008-01-08}}</ref>

===Career===
He intended to become a cartoonist, but Speight eventually became a presenter following a job painting the [[Set construction|set]] of a television production.<ref name="guardobit">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/14/television|title=Mark Speight|accessdate=2008-09-24|date=2008-10-05|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Armstrong |first=Stephen}}</ref> He auditioned for ''[[SMart]]'', and following a successful interview where he met future co-presenter [[Jay Burridge]],<ref name="burridge">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/18/bbc.television|title=Mark and me|accessdate=2008-04-18|date=2008-04-18|first=Jay |last=Burridge|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref> he went on to present ''SMart'' from its first edition in 1994.<ref name="guardobit" /> Speight became close friends with Burridge, whose art studio in West London was used to create all of the art content for ''SMart''; Burridge noted: "We would bounce ideas and jokes off each other all day until we had developed an almost telepathically linked knowledge of what made each other laugh."<ref name="burridge" /> Speight and Burridge were joined by third presenter [[Zo<U+00EB> Ball]], who was replaced first by [[Josie D'Arby]], and then [[Kirsten O'Brien]]. With Burridge and O'Brien, Speight presented the spin-off shows ''[[SMarteenies]]'' and ''[[SMart on the Road]]'', and participated in various live events.<ref name="burridge" /> He achieved further fame while starring in the [[BAFTA]]-nominated [[ITV]] Saturday morning show ''[[Scratchy & Co.]]'' from 1995 until 1998.<ref name="guardobit" />

Speight worked on numerous other shows, ranging from [[children's television]] to adult factual programmes.

They planned to get married in fancy dress and Speight joked that the wedding might feature monkeys, his favourite animal.<ref name="guardobit" />

In 2004, Speight participated in [[Rolf Harris]]'s ''[[Rolf on Art]]'', for which a giant reproduction of [[John Constable]]'s ''[[The Hay Wain]]'' was created in [[Trafalgar Square]]. In 2005, he was involved in a similar project where [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s portrait of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' were both reconstructed, the latter in the grounds of [[Edinburgh Castle]].<ref name="guardobit" /> Speight had planned a project involving a trip to [[Borneo]] in March 2008 to train abused [[orangutan]]s not to fight each other, but this never took place.<ref name="bucks">{{cite news| last = Dakin| first = Melanie| title = CBBC SMart host Mark Speight draws the crowds at The Watersmeet| work = Bucks Free Press| publisher = Newsquest Media Group |date=2007-12-06| url = http://www.thisisbucks.co.uk/leisure/pantoguide/pantointerviews/display.var.1887408.0.cbbc_smart_host_mark_speight_draws_the_crowds_at_the_watersmeet.php| accessdate = 2008-09-24}}</ref> Speight regularly toured with ''Speight of the Art'', a series of art workshops he ran for children,<ref name="guardobit" /> and during the [[Christmas]] period, he became involved in [[pantomime]], performing as "Buttons" in ''Cinderella'' at the Watersmeet, [[Rickmansworth]] in December 2007.<ref name="bucks" />

===Arrest and disappearance===
On the afternoon of 3 January 2008, Speight called emergency services after waking up to discover Natasha Collins's body in the bath of their [[St John's Wood]] flat, in northwest London. Speight told police that he and Collins had spent the previous evening "partying", drinking wine and vodka, and taking cocaine and sleeping pills.<ref name="times">{{cite news |last= Booth |first= Jenny | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3704273.ece | title=TV star Mark Speight 'missing' after fiancee Natasha Collins's inquest | work=[[The Times]] |publisher=[[News International]] | date=2008-04-08 | accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> Speight was questioned by police since he was the only other person living in the flat, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and of supplying [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971#Class A drugs|class A drugs]], but was released on bail until the first week of February.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jan/04/ukcrime.media |title=BBC star bailed after death of girlfriend |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref> Because of this, the BBC cancelled the Saturday repeat edition of ''SMart''.<ref>{{cite news  | title = CBBC star 'distraught' over death | work = BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |date=2008-01-04 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7171292.stm | accessdate = 2008-01-04}}</ref> An [[Inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]], which opened on 8 January 2008, heard that the death was not thought to be suspicious but should be "subject to further investigation".<ref name="notsuspicious">{{cite news | title=Presenter death 'not suspicious' | work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC | date=2008-01-08 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7176552.stm | accessdate = 2008-01-08}}</ref> At that point, police were awaiting results of [[toxicology]] tests after a [[postmortem]] examination was inconclusive.<ref name="Postmortem" /> The BBC cancelled repeat broadcasts of ''SMart'' and ''SMarteenies'' until further notice,<ref name="Postmortem"/> and on 28 February Speight announced he was quitting ''SMart'', because the "tragic loss" of Collins had left him unable to continue with the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7269389.stm|title=CBBC star leaves show over death|work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |date=2008-02-28 | accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref> Speight denied any involvement with Collins's death,<ref name="notsuspicious" /> and on 19 March it was reported that the police were no longer considering Speight as a suspect.<ref name="coroner">{{cite news | title=Actress died after taking drugs | work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC | date=2008-10-05 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7326226.stm | accessdate = 2008-04-13}} </ref>

In April 2008, the coroner recorded a verdict of [[wikt:misadventure|death by misadventure]] in relation to Collins. The cause of death was "cocaine toxicity and immersion in hot water", according to the consultant pathologist. The inquest found that she had taken "very significant" amounts of cocaine with sleeping pills and vodka, and that she had suffered 60% burns to her body, including her tongue.<ref name="coroner"/> The coroner noted that at some stage in the night after both Speight and Collins had gone to bed, Collins got up to have a bath. He said that it was "more likely than not" that a heart problem had caused Collins to fall unconscious while the hot tap was running.<ref name="times"/> Following Collins's death, Speight moved in with her mother.<ref name="missing">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7335912.stm | title=Fiancee death presenter missing | work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC | date=2008-04-08 | accessdate=2008-04-08 }}</ref>

He was caught on CCTV in the afternoon taking money from a [[Automated teller machine|cash machine]] at [[Queen's Park station]], and he subsequently boarded a southbound [[Bakerloo line]] train.<ref name="police" /> He was reported missing the following day by family and friends, and his mother and the mother of Natasha Collins made a public appeal in which they urged him to make contact.<ref name="familyplea" /> Speight's father also appealed for him to get in touch.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7344864.stm | title=Missing star told 'don't give up' |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC | date=2008-04-12 |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref>

===Death and legacy===
On 13 April, Speight's body was discovered hanging from the roof of MacMillan House, adjacent to London's [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], hidden from public view,<ref name="bbcz">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7346909.stm | title=TV host Speight was found hanged |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC | date=2008-04-14 | accessdate=2008-04-14 }}</ref>six days after he died.<ref name="mailonsunday"/> The discovery was made by railway workers at 10:00&nbsp;am,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7345486.stm |title=TV host Mark Speight 'found dead' |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |date=2008-04-13 |accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref> and [[British Transport Police]] confirmed that the body was Speight's on 14 April 2008. An inquest into his death opened on 16 April 2008, and a post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as [[hanging]]. It was then adjourned until 20 May.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7350087.stm | title =  TV presenter left suicide notes |work=BBC News Online |publisher=BBC |date=2008-04-16 | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> The police said Speight may have used a sixth floor fire exit to get to the area where he was found.<ref name="hanged" /> 

The report of Speight's death on the BBC's children's news programme ''[[Newsround]]'' provoked complaints that it upset young viewers. The BBC decided to avoid using the word "suicide," and instead ''Newsround'' reported that "police don't think he was killed by anyone else."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1895775/BBC%27s-Mark-Speight-coverage-made-children-cry.html |title=BBC's Mark Speight coverage made children cry |date=2008-10-05 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

Speight's funeral was held on 28 April at St Michael and All Angels Church in Tettenhall, and hundreds came to pay their respects. The service included a performance by the choir from Tettenhall College, Speight's former school, and his coffin was carried out of the church accompanied by the theme tune of ''SMart''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7370490.stm|title=Funeral for hanged TV presenter|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2008-04-28|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In May, the inquest resumed and determined that Speight had first tried to hang himself with his belt, which was found snapped in his pocket, and had ended up hanging himself with his shoelaces; it was also disclosed that suicide notes had been found, one in his left pocket, and one addressed to his parents in his diary at his home. The notes described how he could not "contemplate life without [Collins]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1995236/Mark-Speight-%27could-not-live-without-fiancee%27.html |title=Mark Speight 'could not live without fiancee' |last=Tibbetts |first=Graham |date=2008-05-20 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref> The coroner Dr Paul Knapman said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. In May 2008, Speight's father created a foundation, ''Speight Of The Art'', or ''SP8 Of The Art'', and launched it at a memorial service which took place on what would have been his 43rd birthday, 6 August 2008 at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's Church]] in Covent Garden, London.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7544799.stm |date=2008-08-06 |title=Memorial for TV presenter Speight |work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>
