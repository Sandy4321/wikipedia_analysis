'''Dunwich''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|d|<U+028C>|n|<U+0268>|t<U+0283>}} is a village and [[civil parish]] in the [[England|English]] [[county]] of [[Suffolk]]. It is located in the [[Suffolk Coast and Heaths]] [[AONB]] around {{convert|92|mi|km|0}} north-east of [[London]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} south of [[Southwold]] and {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} north of [[Leiston]] on the [[North Sea]] coast.

In the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]], Dunwich was the capital of [[Kingdom of the East Angles]] but the harbour and most of the town have since disappeared due to [[coastal erosion]]. At its height it was an international port similar in size to 14th century London.<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130509091118.htm</ref> Its decline began in 1286 when a [[storm surge]] hit the East Anglian coast, and it was eventually reduced in size to the village it is today. Its population at the 2001 census was 84.<ref name="2001census">[http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=03070&productId=779&$ph=60_61&datasetInstanceId=3070&startColumn=1&numberOfColumns=4&containerAreaId=790524 2001 Census data].

==History==
[[File:Dunwich Leper Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 2390815.jpg|left|thumb|220px|The former leper hospital, Norman window detail]]
Since the 15th century, Dunwich has frequently been identified with [[Dommoc]] &ndash; the original seat of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] bishops of the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]] established by [[Sigeberht of East Anglia]] for Saint [[Felix of Burgundy|Felix]] in c. 629&ndash;31.<ref>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book II, Ch.15 (''accepitque sedem episcopatus in ciuitate Dommoc''), who stipulates Felix's mission in relation to Sigeberht's rule.</ref> Dommoc was the seat of the [[Bishop of Dunwich|bishops of Dommoc]] until around 870, when the East Anglian kingdom was taken over by the initially pagan Danes. Years later antiquarians would even describe Dunwich as being the "former capital of East Anglia".<ref>{{cite book |title=The King's England: Suffolk |first=Arthur |last=Mee |pages=124<U+2013>128}}</ref> However, many historians now prefer to locate Dummoc at [[Walton, Suffolk|Walton Castle]], which was the site of a [[Saxon Shore|Saxon shore fort]].<ref>Richard Hoggett, (2010), ''The archaeology of the East Anglian conversion'', pages 35-40. Boydell & Brewer</ref>

The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 describes it as possessing three churches.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gardner |first=Thomas |title=An historical account of Dunwich, antiently a city, now a borough;: Blithburgh, formerly a town of note, now a village; Southwold, once a village, now a town-corporate; with remarks on some places contiguous thereto ... |location=London |year=1754 |page=6 |publisher=Printed for the author, and sold by him at Southwold, in Suffolk; and also by W.

On 1 January 1286<ref name=SRB>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Simons|title=Since Records Began|location=London|publisher=Collins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-00-728463-4|pages=175<U+2013>6}}</ref> a large storm swept much of the town into the sea, and the River Dunwich was partly silted up; this was followed by two further surges in the following year, the [[South England flood of February 1287]] and [[St. Lucia's flood]] in December. Residents fought to save the harbour but this too was destroyed by an equally fierce storm in 1328,<ref name=SRB/> which also swept away the entire village of Newton, a few miles up the coast.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Another large storm in 1347 swept some 400 houses into the sea. The [[Grote Mandrenke]] finally destroyed the village.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-22482097 |title=Dunwich underwater images show 'Britain's Atlantis'|publisher=BBC |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}</ref>

Most of the buildings that were present in the 13th century have disappeared, including all eight churches, and Dunwich is now a small coastal "village", though retaining its status as a town.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} The remains of a 13th-century [[Franciscan]] priory ([[Greyfriar]]s) and the [[leper]] hospital of St James can still be seen.<ref name="sc">{{Cite web |title=All Saints, Dunwich |work=SuffolkChurches.co.uk |url=http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/dunwichas.html |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> A popular local legend says that, at certain tides, church bells can still be heard from beneath the waves.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parker |first=Rowland |title=Men of Dunwich: the story of a vanished town |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1979 |page=10 |isbn=9780030468018}}</ref>

By the mid-19th century, the population had dwindled to 237 inhabitants and Dunwich was described as a "decayed and disfranchised borough".<ref>{{cite book |title=William White History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Suffolk |first=R. |last=Leader |location=Sheffield |year=1844 }}</ref> A new church, St James, was built in 1832, after the last of the old churches, All Saints, which had been without a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] since 1755, was abandoned. All Saints' church fell into the sea between 1904 and 1919, the last major portion of the tower succumbing on 12 November 1919.<ref>{{Cite web |title=St James, Dunwich |work=SuffolkChurches.co.uk |url=http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/dunwichsj.html |accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref> In 2005 historian Stuart Bacon stated that recent low tides had shown that [[shipbuilding]] had previously occurred in the town.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/4328172.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 October 2005 |title=Low Tide Reveals Lost City Find}}</ref>

As a legacy of its previous significance, the [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Dunwich]] retained the right to send two members to Parliament until the [[Reform Act 1832]] and was one of Britain's most notorious [[rotten borough]]s.<ref>{{cite book |first=J Holladay |last=Philbin |title=Parliamentary Representation 1832 - England and Wales |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1965}}</ref>

==Marine archaeology==
[[File:Dunwich Beach.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at Dunwich]]
The Dunwich 2008 project funded by [[English Heritage]] and the [[Esmee Fairbarn Foundation]] was intended to collate all reliable historic mapped data on the same [[WGS84|coordinate system]] and combine this with aerial photography and an underwater survey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Underwater city could be revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7187239.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 April 2011|date=14 January 2008}}</ref><ref name=mus>Dunwich museum plaques viewed 26 April 2012</ref> New digital maps were produced by Prof. David Sear of [[Southampton University]], marine archaeologist Stuart Bacon and the [[Geodata Institute]]. The survey also used multibeam and [[sidescan sonar]] to map the seafloor across the entire area of the town. These surveys identified a series of ruins which were confirmed by divers who recovered stones with [[lime mortar]] still attached. The lime mortar matched nearly perfectly with medieval mortar in existing churches on the coast. In 2009 Wessex Archaeology working with [[Professor Sear]], captured the highest resolution sidescan images of the town site including the ruins found in 2008. Further work in 2010 with [[BBC Oceans]] and the [[BBC One Show]] used novel acoustic imaging cameras ([http://www.soundmetrics.com/products/didson-sonars DIDSON]) to film the ruins through the turbid water. These clearly showed the jumble of ruined blocks and worked stone associated with medieval church and chapel sites. A large survey and updating of the mapped data was commissioned by English Heritage in 2011 and reported in 2012. This compiled all previous survey data and enhanced the historical map and coastal pilot charts for the site. The results have produced the most comprehensive survey of the Dunwich town site - the largest medieval underwater site in Europe.  Data from these surveys including maps and images explaining the different technologies are displayed in Dunwich Museum which is accredited by the Museum Archives Libraries Council. Details of Dunwich's 800 year battle to protect against coastal erosion are also displayed in the museum and it is hoped more work will be done in future.<ref name=mus/>   A database of references to Dunwich "designed to aid academic researchers, family historians and students" is available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunwichmuseum.org.uk/research/index.php|title=Dunwich Museum Research|accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>

In June 2011, at the invitation of Prof David Sear and the Dunwich Town Trust the Anglo-Saxon and medieval archaeology of Dunwich was the subject of a Channel 4 [[Time Team]] investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team/articles/visualising-coastal-change-at-dunwich|title=Visualising Coastal Change at Dunwich|work=Time Team|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>

Further work to explore new sites using DIDSON and diver surveys and a campaign of land based archaeology is scheduled for 2013-15 via the "Touching the tide" ALSF project. This work hopes to confirm the date of the town ditches and roads and explore the record of environmental change in the marsh sediments. Altogether this work has identified the ruins of St Peter's and St Nicholas's churches, a chapel most probably St Katherine's, and ruins associated with Blackfriars friary and the town hall.  The location of the Knight's Templar church and All Saints' church are known from the digital mapping but remain buried beneath an inner sandbank. The early town is buried under 1-3m of sand to the east of the ruins found by Bacon and these later surveys.<ref>http://www.dunwich.org.uk/summary/</ref>

==Churches and other notable structures==
*'''Greyfriars''': [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] [[priory]] situated in the south west of the city. This inland position has resulted in it being one of the few significant parts of ancient Dunwich still visible. It was founded on a site nearer the sea in 1277, moved to its current position in 1290 and survived to the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] in 1538. The priory was originally enclosed by a stone wall much of which remains. The most impressive structures still standing are part of the refectory and the 14th century gateway which would have been the main entrance to the monastic buildings.
[[File:Remains of Franciscan Monastery, Dunwich - geograph.org.uk - 74176.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of Greyfriars Priory]]
<!-- In order of disappearing -->
*'''St Bartholemew's''' and '''St Michael's''' were both [[Chapel of ease|chapels of ease]] that had been constructed by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=knott>{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/dunwichas.html|title=All Saints, Dunwich with an account of Dunwich's other lost churches|last=Simon Knott|date=September 2009|publisher=The Suffolk Churches Site|accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>
*'''St Leonard's''': was a parish church that fell to the sea in the 14th century.<ref name=knott/>
*'''St Nicholas''': this was a [[cruciform]] building which lay to the south of the city. Lost to the sea soon after the [[Black Death]].
*'''St Martin's''': built before 1175, it was lost to the sea between 1335 and 1408.
*'''St Francis Chapel''': standing beside the Dunwich River, the chapel was lost in the 16th century.
*'''St Katherine's Chapel''': situated in the parish of St John, this was lost in the 16th century.
*'''[[Preceptory]] of the [[Knights Templar]]''': the preceptory is thought to have been founded around 1189 and was a circular building not dissimilar to the famous [[Temple Church]] in London. When the [[sheriff]] of [[Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk]] took an inventory in 1308 he found the sum of <U+00A3>111 contained in three pouches - a vast sum. In 1322, on the orders of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], all the Templars' land passed to the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. Following the dissolution of the Hospitallers in 1562 the Temple was demolished and the foundations washed away during the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]<!-- 1600 - 1649 -->.
*'''St Peter's''': similar in length to the church at nearby [[Blythburgh]], St Peter's was stripped of anything of value as the cliff edge drew nearer. The east gable fell in 1688 and the rest of the building followed in 1697. The [[parish register]] survives and is now in the [[British Library]].
*'''Blackfriars''': [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[priory]] situated in the south east of the city. It was founded during the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] by Roger Holish. By 1385 preparations were made for the Dominicans to move to nearby [[Blythburgh]] as the sea front drew nearer, although these were certainly premature as the priory remained active and above sea level until at least the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], with the last building recorded as having fallen to the sea in 1717.
[[File:Dunwich All Saints Ruins.jpg|The ruins of All Saints' Church in Dunwich, here in a postcard of 1904|right|thumb|180px]]
*'''All Saints' Church''': last of Dunwich's ancient churches to be lost to the sea, All Saints' was abandoned in the 1750s after it was decided the parishioners could no longer afford the upkeep, although burials occurred in the churchyard until the 1820s. The cliff edge reached All Saints' in 1904 with the tower falling in 1922.<ref>Comfort: ''The Lost City of Dunwich'': Churches and Chapels, pp&nbsp;99<U+2013>102</ref> One of the tower buttresses was salvaged, however and now stands in the current [[Victorian era|Victorian]]-era St James' Church. One of the last remaining gravestones, dedicated to John Brinkley Easey,<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D3dnAAAAMAAJ&dq=John+Brinkley+Easey&q=John+Brinkley+Easey Thomas Hinde: 'The Domesday book: England's heritage, then and now']</ref> fell over the cliff in the early 1990s. A single gravestone still remains (as of 2011) around 15 feet from the cliff edge in memory of Jacob Forster who died in the late 18th century.

==RAF Dunwich==
During the [[Second World War]] [[RAF]] Dunwich was one of the [[Chain Home Low]] stations which provided low level radar cover for the central East Anglian coast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chain Home Low Stations|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/11group.html|work=11 Group Stations of the {{sic|nolink=y|the}} Battle of Britain|publisher=RAF|accessdate=1 April 2011|date=16 February 2005 (last updated)}}</ref>
