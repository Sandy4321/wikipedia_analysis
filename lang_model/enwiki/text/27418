'''Tropical Storm Bill''' was a tropical storm that affected the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] in the summer of 2003. The second storm of the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]], Bill developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[June 29]] to the north of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. It slowly organized as it moved northward, and reached a peak of 60&nbsp;[[mph]] (95 [[km/h]]) shortly before making landfall 27&nbsp;miles (43&nbsp;km) west of [[Chauvin, Louisiana]]. Bill quickly weakened over land, and as it accelerated to the northeast, moisture from the storm, combined with cold air from an approaching [[surface weather analysis|cold front]], produced an outbreak of 34&nbsp;[[tornado]]es. Bill became extratropical on [[July 2]], and was absorbed by the cold front later that day.

Upon making landfall on [[Louisiana]], the storm produced a moderate [[storm surge]], causing [[tides|tidal]] [[flood]]ing. In a city in the northeastern portion of the state, the surge breached a [[levee]], which flooded many homes in the town. Moderate winds combined with wet [[soil]] knocked down trees, which then hit a few houses and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without [[electric power]]. Two people drowned from rough [[surf]] in [[Florida]]. Further inland, tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage. Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $50&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;[[USD]], $55 million 2006 USD) and four deaths.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Bill 2003 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] developed scattered convection in the central [[Caribbean Sea]] on [[June 24]], while interacting with an upper-level low. It moved slowly northwestward,<ref name="june24two">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=June 24 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Jun/2003062415.ABNT20}}</ref>  and remained disorganized due to strong upper level [[wind shear]].<ref name="june25two">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2003|title=June 25 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Jun/2003062602.ABNT20}}</ref> Late on [[June 27]], the convection became slightly better organized around a broad [[low pressure area]], though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]].<ref name="june27two">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=June 27 Tropical Weather Outlook|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2003/Jun/2003062802.ABNT20}}</ref> The area of low pressure became better defined over the central Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, and after the system turned to the northwest, convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. On [[June 29]], following the development of a closed circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 40&nbsp;miles (60&nbsp;km) north of [[Progreso, Yucat<U+00E1>n]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Bill Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003bill.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression quickly strengthened to become Tropical Storm ''[[William (name)|Bill]]'' later on [[June 29]]. Operationally, the [[National Hurricane Center]] did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status.<ref name="tcr"/> Initially, the system resembled a [[subtropical cyclone]], with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center, though it was classified [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] due to its tropical origins.<ref name="bill1">{{cite web|author=Lawrence|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Bill Discussion One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-10-18|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al032003.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> The storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased,<ref name="tcr"/> and early forecasts from the [[National Hurricane Center]] mentioned the possibility of Bill intensifying to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane status]] if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection.

==Preparations==
Shortly after forming, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Watch|tropical storm watch]] from the southern end of [[Galveston Island]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. As a more northward motion occurred, the watch was canceled and replaced with a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|tropical storm warning]] from [[High Island, Texas]] to [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]]. Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued between High Island and [[Cameron, Louisiana]]. The National Hurricane Center briefly issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Watch|hurricane watch]] from [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana|Intracoastal City]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen.<Ref name="tcr"/> Prior the storm making landfall, local [[National Weather Service]] offices issued [[flash flood]] watches and a [[tornado watch]] for large portions of the Gulf Coast.<Ref name="redcross">{{cite web|author=Bonnie Gillespie|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Bill Roars Ashore in Louisiana|publisher=RedCross.org|accessdate=2006-10-19|url=http://www.redcross.org/article/0,1072,0_332_232,00.html}}</ref> 

The threat of Tropical Storm Bill caused 41&nbsp;[[oil platform]]s and 11&nbsp;[[oil rig]]s to evacuate. This resulted in a loss of production of over 71&nbsp;trillion [[Barrel (unit)|barrels of oil]] and 610&nbsp;million [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] (17&nbsp;million [[cubic meter]]s) of gas.<ref name="oil">{{cite web|author=U.S. Departent of the Interior|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Bill Evacuation and Production Shut In Statistics for July 2, 2003|accessdate=2006-10-19|url=http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/whatsnew/newsreal/030703s.html}}</ref>

The [[American Red Cross]] mobilized workers and brought food, water, and other supplies to Louisiana prior to the storm's arrival. At the request of Louisiana emergency management officials, the organization opened two shelters for residents in low-lying areas. Several floodgates in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] were closed before the storm made landfall, and many universities and government offices were closed as well.

==Impact==
Bill caused four direct deaths along its path, as well as minor to moderate damage. Damage estimates totaled to over $50&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $55&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD), primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage.

==Aftermath==
By one day after the storm, power companies restored electricity to 151,000 customers. Citizens in [[Montegut, Louisiana|Montegut]] circulated a petition for a class-action lawsuit in response to the levee failure.<ref name="usatoday"/> The [[American Red Cross]] set up a church in [[Reserve, Louisiana|Reserve]] as an emergency shelter. Only five people stayed the first night, resulting in the organization to convert it to a family services center. Over 100&nbsp;families asked for food assistance. The Red Cross also set up a shelter in [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], where 14&nbsp;people stayed.<ref name="amredcross"/>

Because damage from Bill was not extensive, the name Bill was not [[List of retired Atlantic hurricanes|retired]], and is scheduled to be used again in the [[Post-2007 Atlantic hurricane seasons|2009 Atlantic hurricane season]].
