'''King Crimson''' are an influential [[England|English]] musical group founded by guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] and drummer [[Michael Giles]] in [[1969]].  Their dense musical style has typically been categorised as [[progressive rock]], although it also has influences from [[jazz]], [[European classical music|classical]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Folk music|folk]]. Although King Crimson has garnered little [[radio]] or [[music video]] airplay, they have a devoted [[cult following|following]].
 
==History ==

Though its membership has fluctuated considerably during its lifetime, the band continues to perform and record music. Guitarist Robert Fripp is said to have once noted that "King Crimson exists when King Crimson needs to exist". Fripp has been the only consistent member, although he has stated that he does not necessarily consider himself the band's leader. To him King Crimson "is a way of doing things",<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Fripp - From Crimson King to Crafty Master|url=http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/contents.htm}}</ref> and the musical consistency that has persisted throughout the band's history, despite frequent rotation of its members, reflects this point of view.

The name King Crimson was coined by lyricist [[Peter Sinfield]] as a synonym for [[Beelzebub]], prince of demons. According to Fripp, Beelzebub would be an [[English language|anglicised]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase "B'il Sabab", meaning "the man with an aim".<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Fripp on the King Crimson name|url=http://www.songsouponsea.com/Promenade/Metaphysical.html}}</ref> However, the original name is understood to be from ba'al zebul, "Lord of the Seat". (The name was later popularly corrupted to ba'al zevel, "Lord of the Dungheap", and ba'al zevuv, "Lord of the Flies", because the god's statue was constantly covered in blood.)<ref>"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable", Millennium Edition 2000, revised by Adrian Room; ISBN 0-304-35096-6</ref>

Drummer [[Michael Giles]] and his brother and bassist Peter, put out an advertisement for a singing organist. [[Robert Fripp]], a guitarist who didn't sing, responded to the ad.  The improbable trio of [[Giles, Giles and Fripp]] was formed. They recorded one album together, the idiosyncratic "The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp."

Fripp and Michael Giles began discussing the formation of a new band. Fripp had seen 1-2-3 (later [[Clouds (60s rock band)|Clouds ]]) at the Marquee, which inspired some of Crimson's penchant for classical melodies and jazz-like improvisation.<ref>"The Illustrated History of Rock" - Clouds by Ed Ward</ref> However, Fripp and Giles would take the concept into previously unheard-of realms in the context of rock music. The first musician to be added to their new lineup was [[Ian McDonald (musician)|Ian McDonald]] on keyboards, reeds and woodwinds. McDonald had been writing songs with lyricist [[Peter Sinfield]], and brought him into the new band. Fripp had seen childhood friend singer-guitarist [[Greg Lake]] perform with a band called the Gods, and recruited him to sing and to step in for the departed Peter Giles on bass. Thus, the first incarnation of King Crimson was born in November of 1968. Shortly afterward, they purchased a [[mellotron]], and began using it to create their trademark orchestral sound.

Early in January 1969, the group rehearsed for the first time. A mere seven months later, the group played the famous free concert in [[Hyde Park]], [[London]], staged by [[The Rolling Stones]] in July 1969 before a crowd in excess of 100,000. The first King Crimson album, ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' was released in October, and received public compliments from the guitarist for [[The Who]], [[Pete Townshend]], who called the album "an uncanny masterpiece."

King Crimson went on tour through England, and later the United States, performing alongside many contemporary popular musicians and musical groups, including [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]. Personal tensions within the band eventually reached a limit, however; Ian McDonald and Michael Giles left the band in December 1969 to pursue solo work.  In [[1970]], they recorded the [[McDonald and Giles]] studio album.  McDonald went on to be a founding member of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] in [[1976 in music|1976]].

=== 1970s ===
[[Image:KC newspaper.jpg|thumb|320px|A page from ''Melody Maker'' announcing Mike Giles and Ian McDonald leaving the group]]
King Crimson's lineup fluctuated tremendously during the next few years. The remaining trio of Fripp, Sinfield, and Lake persevered for a short while, releasing the single ''Cat Food/Groon'' in March of 1970. During this time, material was being developed for King Crimson's second album, ''[[In the Wake of Poseidon]].'' Woodwind player [[Mel Collins]] came on board, and bassist [[Peter Giles]] appeared on several tracks. Greg Lake departed in April to form [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], leaving King Crimson without a vocalist until [[Gordon Haskell]] took over singing, in addition to playing bass, for the band's third album, ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]''. [[Andy McCulloch]] played drums for the album, with [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] singing on one song. Haskell, wishing to re-embrace his folk music roots, left the band as did McCulloch just before the release of ''Lizard'', leaving King Crimson in the unenviable position of being a rock band without a singer, bassist, or drummer.

Fripp and Sinfield began auditioning vocalists and musicians. Among the singers who tried out for them was young [[Bryan Ferry]], leader of the fledgling band [[Roxy Music]]. While his voice was not suitable for King Crimson's material, both Fripp and Sinfield were highly impressed by Ferry's performance, and they helped Roxy Music obtain a recording contract with E.G. Records. Sinfield would go on to produce the first Roxy Music LP. [[Elton John]] also auditioned for the band at this time, according to Fripp's diary.

Drummer [[Ian Wallace (musician)|Ian Wallace]] and vocalist [[Boz Burrell]] were selected, but after more than two dozen potential bassists had come and gone, Fripp decided to teach Burrell to play bass.  Burrell maintained that he was chosen because he preferred the more "twangy" Rotosound brand of strings. In the midst of the lengthy tour that followed, the band released ''[[Islands (King Crimson album)|Islands]]'' in [[1971 in music|1971]]. At the end of that year, King Crimson parted ways with long-time member and lyricist Peter Sinfield, who then reunited with old friend Greg Lake, and became the primary lyricist for Emerson, Lake and Palmer. The remaining members undertook a tour the following year, with the intention of disbanding afterwards. Recordings from this tour were later compiled and edited by Fripp to become the ''[[Earthbound (King Crimson album)|Earthbound]]'' album. 
Shortly after the ''Earthbound'' tour, Collins, Wallace and Burrell left King Crimson to form a band called Snape, with British blues legend [[Alexis Korner]]. Burrell would later became the bassist of [[Bad Company]]. 

Once again, Fripp began the task of looking for new members. The first to join was [[free improvisation|improvising]] [[percussion instrument|percussion]]ist [[Jamie Muir]], fresh from the [[Music Improvisation Company]], and whom Fripp had been considering as a possible member for some time. Next came vocalist and bassist [[John Wetton]], formerly  of the band [[Family (band)|Family]] and a college acquaintance of Fripp. Wetton had been under consideration for the previous lineup of the band, but had declined Fripp's invitation to join. Now that King Crimson was starting from scratch again, the opportunity was ripe. 

Drummer [[Bill Bruford]] was next to sign up, choosing to leave the commercially successful [[Yes (band)|Yes]] for the relatively unstable and unpredictable King Crimson. Bruford himself was more interested in artistic pursuits, and the framework of King Crimson appealed to that sensibility in him. Finally, violin, viola and keyboard player [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]] was selected to flesh out the sound of the new band. With Pete Sinfield gone, a new lyricist was needed. John Wetton recommended his old friend [[Richard Palmer-James]], who got the job.

Rehearsals and touring began in late 1972, and ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' was released early the next year, and the group spent the remainder of 1973 touring Britain, Europe, and America. This era of King Crimson demonstrated a kinship with the nascent [[heavy metal music]] then developing mainly in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  

Muir left the group in early 1973 (reportedly joining a Buddhist monastery), and during the lengthy tour that followed, the remaining members began assembling material for their next album, ''[[Starless and Bible Black]].'' By early 1974, the album was completed. Most of the album was recorded from live performances in 1973, with only two full tracks ("The Great Deceiver" and "Lament") and parts of two other tracks ("The Night Watch" and "The Mincer") being studio productions, a fact that underscores King Crimson's essentially live nature. Fripp believed that studio recordings were unable to capture the atmosphere and energy of the band's live performances. 

During Crimson's 1974 tour of Europe and America, the place of David Cross in the group was coming under pressure. His role as a violinist had been more integral to the band's music in the earlier days of this version of Crimson, but as the music progressed <U+2014> and got louder <U+2014> he increasingly felt his contribution was being marginalised; reduced, as he once said, to being just the electric piano player. He departed, leaving the remaining trio to record ''[[Red (album)|Red]]''. 

With Cross gone, ''Red'' included guest appearances by musicians from previous albums: Robin Miller on oboe, [[Marc Charig]] on cornet and former King Crimson member Mel Collins on soprano saxophone. Cross appeared on ''Providence'', recorded live in its namesake in [[Rhode Island]]. Ian McDonald, from the original incarnation of Crimson, also guested on [[alto saxophone]], with plans to rejoin as a full-time member. Fripp, increasingly disillusioned with the music business, was turning his attention to the writings of the mystic [[George Gurdjieff]], and even spoke of being replaced by McDonald. 

The ''Red'' line-up (with McDonald added as a fourth member) never toured, however; two months before the album's release, (and during rehersals for the next Crimson album provisionally entitled ''Blue'') Robert Fripp announced that King Crimson had ceased to exist. "King Crimson is completely over for ever and ever," he said. It seemed that King Crimson was to end in ''Red''; instead, it was the end of an era.

=== 1980s ===
[[Image:KingCrimson1980s.jpg|thumb|King Crimson 1980s lineup: Adrian Belew, Robert Fripp, Bill Bruford and Tony Levin.]] Early in 1981, Fripp and Bruford began considering the formation of a new group, to be called [[Discipline (album)|Discipline]]. The two spent some time searching for a bassist, but had little success in recruiting one until [[Tony Levin]] stopped by. Levin was known for his session work with [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and others, and would have been one of Fripp's first choices had he known Levin was available. King Crimson had its bassist, and also a new sound in the [[Chapman Stick]], which Levin would use instead of [[bass guitar]] on all but two of the tracks on their forthcoming LP.

During this time, Fripp called up guitarist [[Adrian Belew]], who was on tour with [[Talking Heads]]. (Belew had also stepped in for Fripp on [[David Bowie]]'s [[Lodger]] album when Fripp was unavailable, playing both guitar and drums). Fripp had never worked with another guitarist in the same band, so the decision to seek a second guitarist was indicative of Fripp's desire to create a sound unlike previous incarnations of King Crimson. After some initial resistance, Belew would join following his tour with Talking Heads.

During rehearsals and initial recorded sessions in 1981, Fripp began suspecting that this new band really was King Crimson, despite his decision to call it Discipline (Belew in particular did not care for the Discipline moniker). The other members concurred, and so King Crimson was reborn. The group released a trilogy of albums: ''[[Discipline (album)|Discipline]]'', ''[[Beat (King Crimson album)|Beat]],'' and ''[[Three of a Perfect Pair]].'' Belew was responsible for the vocals, as well as almost all of the lyrics on the three albums. Also, with Belew, King Crimson for the first time had a lyricist who was also a performing member of the band<!--SOMETHING MEANINGLESS..., discounting the [[EMS VCS 3|VCS3 synthesiser]] that [[Peter Sinfield]] used during ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]''-->.

This version of King Crimson bore some resemblance to [[new wave music]], a result of Belew's tenure with Talking Heads (considered progenitors of the genre) as well as a nod to Fripp's 1979 solo albumn [[Exposure]], which featured among others, former [[XTC]] and League of Gentleman keyboardist [[Barry Andrews]].  With this Crimson, Fripp intended to create the sound of a "rock [[gamelan]]", with an interlocking rhythmic quality to the paired guitars that he found similar to [[Indonesia]]n gamelan ensembles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Fripp - From Crimson King to Crafty Master, Chapter 9|url=http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/ch09.htm}}</ref> 

After ''Three of a Perfect Pair'', King Crimson disbanded for several years. Fripp entered into a series of legal wranglings with his management company, and this occupied much of his time, but resulted in the development of Discipline Global Mobile, a company through which King Crimson and various side projects and archives have emerged.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Fripp invited former [[Japan (band)|Japan]] lead singer [[David Sylvian]] to front a new King Crimson lineup that would have also included Chapman Stick player and Guitar Craft alumnus [[Trey Gunn]].  Sylvian declined the offer, yet the three musicians composed and toured together in 1992.  When the trio went into the studio to record, former [[Peter Gabriel]] sideman [[Jerry Marotta]] was brought in to play the drums. A 'Crimsonesque' CD, ''The First Day'' was recorded and released in July 1993. In an interview with [[Rolling Stone]], Fripp made the future King Crimson lineup known for the first time: Fripp, Belew, Levin, Gunn and Marotta.  Fripp, Gunn, Levin and Marotta had already convened in early 1993 to throw some musical ideas around.  The results of this gathering between the four were the seeds to future Crim tracks, ''Vrooom'' and ''One Time''.

During the autumn of 1993, Sylvian and Fripp went on a tour to promote ''The First Day''. Marotta had prior commitments as a session drummer, but was still expected to join the planned reunion of Crimson in January 1994 (as was written in the Sylvian / Fripp tour book that was printed in August of 1993).  Eventually, Marotta made it known to [[Tony Levin]] that he was not going to take part in the reformation of Crimson after all, due to the lucrative session and production work that was coming his way.  Former [[Mr. Mister]] drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] auditioned for the spot vacated by Marotta and won the job. Sylvian/Fripp went on the road for the rest of the year.  Levin and Belew lobbied Fripp to ask Bruford to return to his old band, but Fripp and Gunn already had Mastelotto in mind for the job. Eventually both drummers were brought in.  The "double trio" formation of King Crimson was not so much a plan, but a compromise. Bruford was brought in to appease the two former members, as well as a majority of the band's core audience. When the inclusion of Marotta was first announced, there was significant derision toward the idea. The same treatment would most likely have been accorded Mastelotto as well, had Bruford also not been asked to join. 

King Crimson reformed as a sextet in 1994. This "double trio" formation released a few CDs in the mid 1990s: ''[[VROOOM]]'' (1994), ''[[THRAK]]'' (1995), and ''[[THRaKaTTaK]]'' (1996). The new King Crimson sound was something of a mixture of Discipline-era complementary guitars with the heavy rock feel of 1974's ''Red''. Staging and rehearsing the sextet was an expensive proposition, however: this, combined with the level of experimentation within the band, soon contributed to its collapse.

In the late 1990s, Discipline Global Mobile operated as a distinctly artist-friendly label, and featured not only the works of King Crimson, but also of many side projects. ProjeKcts [[ProjeKct One|One]], [[ProjeKct Two|Two]], [[ProjeKct Three|Three]], and [[ProjeKct Four|Four]], each a splinter group (a "[[fractal|fraKctalisation]]", according to Fripp) of King Crimson, released various recordings, demonstrating the [[free improvisation|improvisational]] musical highwire act that the constituent musicians are able to produce. 

In 1998, DGM created the King Crimson Collector's Club (KCCC), a subscription-based service that released a live recording (originating from soundboard or bootleg recordings) every two months. 
[[Image:kc-ticket.jpg|thumb|300px|A ticket for a 2003 King Crimson live act in Russia]].

=== 2000s ===
After the initial ProjeKcts' task was completed, Fripp outlined several possible futures for King Crimson. One of the ideas presented was ProjeKct Zero, a ProjeKct unit that would feature all six King Crimson members. Bruford was not interested and quit the band to focus on his first love, jazz, and Levin let his active involvement in King Crimson rest until further notice; this left Belew, Fripp, Gunn, and Mastelotto as the next line-up. Their first studio effort was ''[[The ConstruKction of Light]]'' ([[2000]]), accompanied by another album, ''[[Heaven and Earth (2000 album)|Heaven and Earth]]'', which was released under the name [[ProjeKct X]]. ''Heaven and Earth'' was edited together by Mastelotto from material recorded during the rehearsal and recording period of the studio album.

After the economic reversals of 2000 and 2001, DGM ceased acting as a general label and artist's blog site and refocused its energy on King Crimson. A lengthy ''[[The ConstruKction of Light]]'' tour was followed by another tour opening for the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and the ''Level Five'' tour that served to write, rehearse, and evolve new pieces for the next album. In 2003, the album ''[[The Power to Believe]]'' was released and the band toured in support of it.

In late November 2003, Trey Gunn announced his departure from the band. Both Robert Fripp and Tony Levin reported that Levin will become the active bassist of King Crimson again. The current line-up thus is Fripp, Belew, Mastelotto and Levin. A 2005 interview with Belew revealed that the band was on a brief [[hiatus]], and planned to return to studio work in September 2007, but Fripp and Belew met and collaborated on some new material at StudioBelew in February 2006. Fripp has recently referred to this collaboration to as [[ProjeKct Six]], which intends to do some tours in America later in the year. [[ProjeKct Five]] has also been mentioned in Fripp's online diary as making a live debut at the Mercy Lounge in Nashville on July 28th, - apparently a mistake, as ProjeKct Six are listed as playing that date - however this engagement has been postponed indefinitely due to the sudden death of Adrian Belew's longtime friend and engineer, [[Ken Latchney]].<ref name="Project Six Debut Gig Cancelled">{{cite web|title=Project Six Debut Gig Cancelled|publisher=DGMLive|date=[[July 27]] [[2006]]|author=Sid Smith|url=http://www.dgmlive.com/news.htm?entry=473}}</ref> ProjeKct Six toured the U.S. in fall of 2006, opening for [[Porcupine Tree]].

Former member [[Boz Burrell]] died on [[21 September]] [[2006]] following a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]],<ref>[http://sidsmith.blogspot.com/2006/09/boz-burrell-1st-august-1946-21st.html Sid Smith's blog]</ref> and five months and a day later, former member [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] died of [[esophageal cancer]] on [[22 February]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.ianrwallace.com Ian Wallace's website]</ref>

==Music==
Fripp, as noted, has described King Crimson as "a way of doing things", and also as "an experiment in organising [[Anarchism|anarchy]]". Over a period of 35 years, and many changes in membership, configuration, and instrumentation, King Crimson has maintained a kind of consistency in its musical vision rare among long-lived bands.

===Influences===
The music of King Crimson was obviously grounded to some extent in the rock of the 1960s, and especially the [[acid rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] movements. The first King Crimson frequently played [[Donovan|Donovan's]]  "Get Thy Bearings", and were known to play [[The Beatles|The Beatles']] "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" in their rehearsals. 

However, where bands like the Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]] played more sophisticated forms of American rock, Crimson attempted to "Europeanise" what had previously been an essentially American form of music. To a great extent, they stripped away the [[blues]]-based foundation of rock music and replaced it with a foundation based in the modern European symphonic tradition. Though they cast a wide net, two names in particular seem to have had a powerful influence on Crimson's music. 

[[Gustav Holst]] is the more obvious of the two on the surface. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the ''Mars'' section of Holst's suite ''[[The Planets]]'' as a regular part of their live set. The influence of [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]] is more subtle, but has been referred to many times by Fripp and other band members, and seems more pervasively present in the band's overall musical repertoire. As a result of this influence, their first album is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the [[symphonic rock]] or [[progressive rock]] movements.

Robert Fripp's solo work and King Crimson's music from 1981 onwards show a definite influence of [[Gamelan]] music as well as late 20th Century classical composers such as [[Phillip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Terry Riley]].

Further classical influence can be inferred between likening [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg's]] title "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" with King Crimson's "[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]".

===Musical themes===
{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
Fans have two antithetical complaints about each new album or incarnation of the band: either they say that it's nothing like the King Crimson they know and love, or they say that it's exactly like what has gone before and nothing new has been added. The apparent contradiction can be resolved by understanding that, while the group constantly creates new sounds and new pieces, several themes have remained constant from the earliest versions of the band to the present.

The most obvious of these themes is composition by the use of a gradually building rhythmic motif. The Holst ''Mars'' that the first King Crimson played is a clear example of this, with its complex pulse in 5/4 time over which strings and winds<U+2014>or, as played by King Crimson, [[mellotron]]<U+2014>play a skirling melody above. This piece evolved into "The Devil's Triangle", a piece composed on variations of the central theme of ''Mars'', split into three parts which were increasingly removed from the original ''Mars,'' on the ''In the Wake of Poseidon'' album. It was followed by many other forms, from "The Talking Drum" in 1973 (on ''Larks' Tongues in Aspic''), "Industry" in 1984 (on ''Three of a Perfect Pair'') all the way to "Dangerous Curves" in 2003 (on ''The Power to Believe'').

A second recurring theme is an instrumental piece, often embedded as a break in a song, in which the band plays a passage of considerable rhythmic complexity. One of King Crimson's best-known songs, "[[21st Century Schizoid Man]]", is an early example of this. Their series of pieces collectively titled ''Larks' Tongues in Aspic'' (as well as pieces of similar intent, such as "Thrak" and "Level Five") go deeper into [[polyrhythm]]ic complexity, delving into rhythms that wander into and out of general synchronisation with each other<U+2014>to the point where the listener is frequently unable to even count the main measure beats<U+2014>yet through polyrhythmic synchronisation all 'finish' together. (These pieces occasionally fail onstage, instances of which Fripp refers to as "train wrecks" or "clams crimsonique".) Perhaps the pinnacle of rhythmic complexity in the band's repertoire was the trilogy of early 1980s albums, which contained gamelan-like rhythmic layers and continual staccato patterns overlaying each other (a case in point being "Neal And Jack And Me" from ''Beat'').

Other themes harder to document clearly include the composition of difficult passages for individual instruments (especially Fripp's guitar<U+2014>notably "Fracture" on ''Starless and Bible Black''); pieces with a loud, aggressive sound not unlike [[heavy metal music]]; and the juxtaposition of ornate tunes and ballads with unusual, often dissonant noises.

===Improvisation===
{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
From the beginning, King Crimson performances featured improvisations, in which the music can, and frequently does, go anywhere. Improvisations can be imbedded in composed pieces, like ''Moonchild'' or ''Thrak'', but most Crimson performances over the years have included at least one stand-alone improvisation, where the band simply started playing and took the music wherever it went, sometimes including passages of restrained silence (as Bill Bruford's contribution to the improvised ''Trio''). The earliest example of an unambiguously improvising King Crimson on record is the spacious, oft-criticised (as self indulgent) extended middle-section of ''Moonchild'' from the first album, in which the composed parts act as bookends to the improv.

Unlike most rock improvisation or jamming, these sessions are rarely in any sense blues-based. They vary so much in sound that King Crimson has been able to release several albums consisting entirely of improvised music. Occasionally, particular improvised pieces will be performed in different forms at different shows, becoming more and more refined and eventually appearing on official studio releases (the most recent example being ''Power to Believe III'', which originally existed as the stage improv ''Deception of the Thrush,'' a piece played onstage for more than six years before appearing on record).

==Trivia==

* In 1968, [[Peter Sinfield]] was the leader of a band called Creation. Ian McDonald approached him and said, "Peter, I have to tell you that your band is hopeless, but you write some great words. Would you like to get together on a couple of songs?" One of the first songs McDonald and Sinfield wrote together was ''In the Court of the Crimson King''.<ref>[http://www.elephant-talk.com/intervws/sinfield.htm Interview with Peter Sinfield]</ref>

* Robert Fripp likes to say: "The Giles Brothers were looking for a singing organist. I was a non-singing guitar player. After 30 days of recording and playing with them I asked if I got the job or not <U+2014> joking like, you know? And Michael Giles rolled a cigarette and said, very slowly, 'Well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to commit ourselves, shall we?' I still don't know if I ever got the job." {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
