{{nihongo|'''''Unlimited Saga'''''|<U+30A2><U+30F3><U+30EA><U+30DF><U+30C6><U+30C3><U+30C9>: <U+30B5><U+30AC>}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (company)|Square]] (later [[Square Enix]]) for the [[PlayStation 2]] as the ninth game in their ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series. Originally released in Japan in December 2002, the game was later made available for North American players in June 2003 and in Europe the following October. The game was designed by series veteran [[Akitoshi Kawazu]] who is given a [[byline]] on the cover of the game's packaging, with music composed by [[Masashi Hamauzu]] who had previously provided the soundtrack for the game's predecessor, ''[[SaGa Frontier 2]]''. A special limited collector's edition was made available exclusively in Japan and was released alongside the regular edition.

Set in a [[fantasy]] world, the game follows the exploits of seven adventurers as they travel the world in search of the Seven Wonders, mysterious artifacts left behind by an ancient civilization that are said to bring about a new golden age of peace and prosperity when found.  Taking a departure from previous games in the series, ''Unlimited Saga'' is structured more like a [[board game]] than a traditional role-playing endeavor, with heavily randomized features such as the roulette-like "Reel System" and hidden traps to hinder a player's progress.

''Unlimited Saga'' was a commercial success, having sold over half a million units worldwide to date. While the game was mostly well received in Japan, it was largely panned by critics in North America and Europe for its unorthodox gameplay and high difficulty.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:usaga1.jpg|thumb|left|A battle scene where a player uses the Reel System to attack an enemy.]]
Players must navigate their characters through a number of environments while completing story-based objectives in order to advance the plot. Players can assume the role of one of seven characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and back stories, and become involved in the narrative by interacting with non-player characters and exploring dangerous areas.<ref>{{cite web | title = Unlimited Saga RPG PS2 Review | work = | publisher = Kidzworld | url = http://www.kidzworld.com/article/3742-unlimited-saga-rpg-ps2-review | accessdate = 2009-04-14}}</ref> During the game, players will explore towns which can be used to gather information and purchase good to aid them on their journey before setting off for the wilds. Unlike previous ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' series games, rather than freely roaming through dungeons, forests, and other environments, the game is structured like a [[board game]], referred to as the "Map Movement System", where players must move space by space to reach the end. On some spaces, the player may encounter objects such traps or locked doors that can be overcome by using the "Reel System", a device resembling a [[roulette]] wheel that may result in a good or bad outcome. While navigating the game board, the player will also encounter enemy monsters that must be defeated in order to advance.

Combat in ''Unlimited Saga'' takes place using a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] system where the player must input commands for each character individually, which are then carried out in order in accordance with their "speed" statistic.  Parties can consist of up to five characters who are recruited either automatically as part of the story, or once a player has completed certain objectives. After selecting a specific attack to use each round, the player must then utilize the Reel System to randomly decide whether the action will take place.  Depending on what icon the Reel lands on, an attack may land as intended, deal increased damage, or fail completely. While characters will initially have only a normal attack, they will randomly learn new combat skills based on their equipped weapon by continually attacking enemies, thus adding them to the Reel for a chance to use them in future battles.  Any character may equip up to two different kinds of weapons, which have their own set of skills to learn. Players have the option to use multiple Reels instead of just one for a combo attack each round, allowing more than one character to attack an enemy at the same time.  By winning battles, characters gain increased statistics that allow them to battle progressively more difficult enemies.

==Development==
''Unlimited SaGa'' was [[Video game producer|directed and produced]] by [[Akitoshi Kawazu]], the creator of the ''SaGa'' series. The character designs and art direction were done by [[Yusuke Naora]], who was the art director of ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. For the graphics, Square partnered with [[Adobe Systems]] to create "Sketch Motion" during battles. Using programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]], hand-drawn 2D designs were combined with 3D models to create a unique hybrid look.<ref name="Sketch">{{cite web | author=Adobe | title=SQUARE - UNLIMITED SaGa Feature | url=http://www.adobe.com/jp/digitalimag/features/square_saga/index.html| publisher=Adobe.com | accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> As with other games in the series, director Akitoshi Kawazu chose a non-traditional way of designing the game. He stated, "As far as ''Unlimited Saga'' is concerned, we said let's tackle the basics of game design once again. We didn't try to emphasize the realistic details, but rather symbolize, and cut out the parts we didn't need. We thought, let's dare to do a 'not express' thing and we calmly [stuck] to that route."<ref name="Quote">{{cite web | author=Chris Winkler, Eve C. | year=2003 | title=Creator's Talk Interview #1: Akitoshi Kawazu | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/creatorstalk/index1.html | publisher=RPGFan | accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

The music was composed by [[Masashi Hamauzu]], while [[synthesizer]] programming was done by [[Ryo Yamazaki]]. The two previously collaborated on the soundtrack for ''[[SaGa Frontier 2]]'' after the departure of previous series composer [[Kenji Ito]]. Because the game uses [[streaming audio in video games|streaming audio]], it was possible for the sound team to use real acoustic instrument sounds in place of a synthesizer.<ref name="songs">{{cite music release notes| Name=UNLIMITED: SaGa Original Soundtrack | Artist=Masashi Hamauzu and Ryo Yamazaki | Type=album| Year=2002| Format=CD liner| Publisher=DigiCube| PID=SSCX-10078~9| Location=Japan}}</ref> Three pieces, including "March in C", were written for full [[orchestra]]. Live recording of [[Chamber music#Ensembles|ensembles]] of tracks such as "Feel Uneasy About the Wonders" and "Battle Theme IV" pitted solo instruments against one another to create what Hamauzu considered a [[Latin American music|Latin sound]]. The ending vocal piece "Soaring Wings" was written specifically for singer Mio Kashiwabara.<ref name="songs"/> ''Unlimited Saga'' features five-channel [[surround sound]] support from [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]]'s [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Pro Logic II]].<ref name="Dolby">{{cite web | author=Heath Hindman | year=2003 | title=Preview: Unlimited SaGa | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/saga/usaga/usagaprev.html | publisher=RPGamer | accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The [[Music of the SaGa series#Unlimited Saga Original Soundtrack|game's soundtrack]] consists of 58 songs spanning two discs.

''Unlimited Saga'' was not well-received outside of Japan, receiving mostly low to average scores from critics. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' simply declared: "This game sucks. Unlimited Saga exemplifies everything that's wrong with RPGs today and throws it all together in one deluxe package for all to avoid like the plague."<ref name="EGM" /> ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' largely agreed, stating that the game "ruined the SaGa franchise" with its "excruciating difficulty, obtuse mechanics, a stifling lack of freedom, and a brutal mission structure that punishes you as often as it rewards you."<ref>OPM staff (September 2004). "Overrated/Underrated" ([http://www.extremecroquet.com/Ziff/Flashwork/UnderOver/overrated.swf SWF transcript]).
