The city's original name&nbsp;<U+2013> ''Prayaga'', or  "place of offerings"&nbsp;<U+2013> comes from its position at the [[Triveni Sangam|union]] of the [[Ganges]], [[Yamuna]] and [[Sarasvati River]]s. It is the second-oldest city in India, and plays a central role in [[Hindu scriptures]]. Allahabad was originally called Kaushambi (now a [[Kaushambi District|separate district]]) by the Kuru rulers of [[Hastinapur]], who developed it as their capital. Since then, Allahabad has been a political, cultural and administrative centre of the [[Doab]] region. The [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] renamed Prayag Allahabad. In 1833 it became the seat of the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] region before its capital was moved to [[Agra]] in 1835.<ref name="MHBI">{{cite book|author=H.S.

Located in southern Uttar Pradesh, the city's metropolitan area covers 63.07 km2 (24.35 sq mi). Although the city and its surrounding area are governed by several municipalities, a large portion of Allahabad District is governed by the Allahabad City Council. The city is home to colleges, research institutions and [[Central government|central]] and [[Government of Uttar Pradesh|state government]] offices. Allahabad has hosted cultural and sporting events, including [[Kumbh Mela]] and the [[Indira Marathon]]. Although the city's economy was built on tourism, most of its income now derives from real estate and financial services.
