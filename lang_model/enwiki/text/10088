{{seealso|Alaska Route 1}}
The '''Seward Highway''' is a highway in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] that extends {{convert|127|mi|km}} from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. It was completed in 1951 and runs through the scenic [[Kenai Peninsula]] and [[Turnagain Arm]], for which it was designated an [[National Scenic Byway|All-American Road]] by the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]].

The Seward Highway is numbered '''Alaska Route&nbsp;9''' ('''AK-9''') for the first {{convert|37|mi|km}} from Seward to the [[Sterling Highway]], and [[Alaska Route 1|AK-1]] for the remaining distance to Anchorage. At the junction with the Sterling Highway, AK-1 turns west towards [[Sterling, Alaska|Sterling]] and [[Homer, Alaska|Homer]].

About {{convert/spell|8|mi|km}} of the Seward Highway leading into Anchorage is built to [[freeway]] standards.  In Anchorage, the Seward Highway terminates at the green belt, where AK-1 is routed southbound on Gambell Street, and northbound on Ingra Street. At 6th Avenue, AK-1 turns east and becomes the [[Glenn Highway]]. Alaska 1 runs westbound on 5th Avenue. Signs point towards the Seward and Glenn Highways at this location.

==Route description==
===Seward to Bear Creek===
The Seward Highway begins at an intersection with Railway Avenue, in [[Seward, Alaska]], less than {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. At this point, the Seward Highway is two lanes, with a parking lane on each side. The Seward Highway is designated as AK-9 at this point of the route. The highway continues through central Seward, passing several small businesses, houses, the Seward Museum, and several hotels and motels. The highway continues passed "The Lagoon" a small harbor, and the [[Seward Airport]], before entering the township of [[Bear Creek, Alaska]].<ref name="googlemaps"/> Just after entering Bear Creek, a set of railroad tracks comes alongside the roadway. These railroad tracks continue on with the Seward Highway until [[Crown Point, Alaska|Crown Point]], and then return near a junction with the [[Portage Glacier Highway]], and remain until the highway becomes a freeway, in southern Anchorage. The highway proceeds through central Bear Creek, passing [[Bear Lake (Alaska)|Bear Lake]], until entering [[Chugach National Forest]].<ref name="Map of Highway">{{cite map |url=http://www.dot.state.ak.us/scenic/seward/recmap2.JPG |title= Seward Highway Scenic Byway |publisher= [[Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities]] |accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Chugach National Forest===
The Seward Highway enters the [[Chugach National Forest]] after just over {{convert/spell|5|mi|km}} of existance. The highway enters Chugach while it is still part of the Bear Creek community, so it still appears as if it were in the city limits. After a mile or so, though, all trace of civilization disapears, and the road passes through miles of dense, elevated pine forest. The previously metioned railroad track weaves back and forth under the highway, creating several bridges. For a few miles or so, the Seward Highway is a four-lane road, but merges into two. After about 10 miles of wilderness, the highway passes Primrose Spur Road, and enters [[Primrose, Alaska]]. For the next five or so miles, the route runs alongside [[Kenai Lake]]. Right before peeling off of Kenai Lake, the route passes though [[Crown Point, Alaska|Crown Point]], passes the single runway Lawling airport, and gives access to the Trail River Campgrounds. The highway runs alongside the Trail River for about six miles, before passing the settlement of [[Moose Pass, Alaska]]. The road continues along Upper Trail Lake for a few miles, before peeling off and returning to the dense forest, passing a large mountain range. After a few miles, the road passes the community of Tern Lake Junction, and intersects with [[Alaska Route 1]], where Alaska Route 9 terminates, and Alaska 1 takes the name of Seward Highway. After that, for several miles, the route continues through relativly the same conditions, with a mountain range to the east, and dense forest surrounding the actual road. After approximately 10 miles, the route passes the scenic [[Summit Lake (Alaska)|Summit Lake]], and provides access to the Tenderfoot Creek Campgrounds. The road then continues through a large mountain range, with snow-capped mountains on either side of the scenic route. After about eight miles of this, the route intersects the [[Hope Highway]], which provides access to the city of [[Hope, Alaska]]. The road continues though the highly elevated mountain range for a few miles, before providing access to the Bertha Creek Campgrounds, and continuing on. The route continues on through the mountains for a few dozen more miles, before reaching the [[Turnagain Arm]], and intersecting the [[Portage Glacier Highway]]. At this point, as previously stated, the set of railroad tracks again come alongside the route. The highway continues on for approximately eight miles, passing the low-lying Turnagain arm to the west, and the snow-capped [[Kenai Mountains]] to the east. The route then exits the [[Chugach National Forest]]. The Seward Highway spent approximately 72.8 miles inside the boundaries of the Chugach National Forest.<ref name="googlemaps"/>

===Girdwood to Anchorage===
After exiting Chugach, the Seward Highway continues for about five miles through empty pine forest, before passing through the unincorperated community of [[Girdwood, Alaska]], and passing several fast-food restaurants. After about a mile, the highway reenters dense forest, this time part of [[Chugach State Park]]. The road passes through 10 or so miles of sloped land, due to the erosion from the Kenai Mountains, before passing a small, unincorporated community. The route reenters the park for about a mile, enters the community of [[Indian, Alaska]], and after a half a mile, again enters the forest. The Seward Highway continues for another 12 miles or so, running directly upon the [[Gulf of Alaska]], with the Kenai Mountains right up on the other side. The road proceeds for another couple of miles, before entering the city limits of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. The highway intersects Old Seward Road, before becoming a four-lane freeway/expressway. The freeway's first exit is, ironically, for Old Seward Road. The freeway passes several neighborhoods, a plant nursery, and [[Rabbit Creek Elementary School]]. The freeway gives incomplete access to De Armoun Road, and continues passed rows of houses. At the exit for De Armoun, Brayton Drive, a [[frontage road]] for northbound A-1 begins. The freeway continues passed dozens of neighborhoods, a few small businesses, has exits for a few small roads, including O'Malley Road, which, after about a quarter of a mile, becomes the [[Minnesota Drive Expressway]]. After an exit for Abbott Road, Homer Drive, the frontage road for southbound A-1 terminates. The route then passes through a more business area of town, passing several warehouses.<ref name="googlemaps"/> At the freeway's final exit, for Tudor Road, both frontage roads either begin or terminate. The freeway ends at the highways intersection with East 36th Avenue. After about a half a mile, the highway splits into '''Ingra Street''' (Northbound), and '''Gambell Street''' (Southbound). The Seward highway officially reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with 5th Avenue.<ref name="Seward Highway Directions">{{cite web |author= Staff |work= America's Byways |publisher= [[Federal Highway Administration]] |url= http://byways.org/explore/byways/10390/directions.html |title= Seward Highway Driving Directions |accessdate=March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Map 2">{{cite web|author=America's Byways|url=http://byways.org/explore/byways/10390/travel.html|title=Seward Highway Map - America's Byways|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
The Seward highway was completed on October 19, 1951,<ref name="Highway Creation">{{cite web |author= Staff |publisher=Alaska Historical Society |url= http://www.alaskahistoricalsociety.org/index.cfm/discover-alaska/This-Month-in-Alaska-History/24 |work=History of Alaska |title= October |accessdate= March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name="City of Seward">{{cite web |publisher= City of Seward |url= http://www.cityofseward.net/hpc/seward_history/index.html |author= Seward Historic Preservation Commission |title= Seward History: Community History and Character |accessdate= March 13, 2012}}</ref> and was built to connect people living in Seward to the major city of Anchorage, without having to go by air or sea. An {{convert|18|mi|km}} long stretch of the route, traveling from Seward to [[Kenai Lake]] was completed in 1923. Another portion of the highway, traveling  between Moose Pass and Hope, was completed in 1928. The 18 mile bridge, nicknamed "The Missing Link"<ref name="City of Seward"/>, which would connect the Seward and Moose Pass portions, was not completed until 1946, which was a major cause to the delayed completion.<ref name="City of Seward"/> The entire length of the highway was paved in 1952.<ref name="Highway Creation"/>
