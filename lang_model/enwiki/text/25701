In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Aeris is a 22-year-old flower girl who joins [[AVALANCHE]]. As the story progresses, AVALANCHE begin to pursue the antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], and the player learns that Aeris is a Cetra, or "Ancient", the first ever race to live on the planet. She was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] with influence from [[Yoshinori Kitase]], [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Yoshitaka Amano]]. Aerith has also appeared in the later-released ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' and [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'']] series. 

Her voice actors are [[Maaya Sakamoto]] in the Japanese versions of the [[Kingdom Hearts series|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]] and ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=527| title = Maaya Sakamoto| publisher = [[Anime News Network]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> singer and actress [[Mandy Moore]] in the English version of ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/tech_info.html| title = Kingdom Hearts - Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> and actress [[Mena Suvari]] in the English versions of ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''Advent Children''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002546/| title = Mena Suvari| publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> Aerith and the events surrounding her in ''Final Fantasy VII'' have met with an overall positive reception.

==Creation and influence==
Aerith of ''Final Fantasy VII'' was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] with influence from [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]. [[Yoshitaka Amano]] created conceptual artwork of Aeris for ''Final Fantasy VII'', which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with pink ribbons. She wears a long pink dress, a [[bolero jacket]], and brown [[hiking boots]]. The long dress was designed as a contrast to [[Tifa Lockhart]]'s [[miniskirt]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Tetsuya Nomura's 20s| url = http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1| publisher = Flare Gamer| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> Nomura re-designed Aeris similarly for ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'', but her design was updated in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' with the addition of bracelets, a belt, and the removal of her bolero jacket. Nomura modified her dress in ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'' to add white and green colors, and that version was used as a base for her design in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.

Aerith's original Japanese name is <U+30A8><U+30A2><U+30EA><U+30B9> (''Earisu'') {{IPA|[ea<U+027A><U+0320>is(<U+026F>)]}} ''{{Audio|Aerith (Japanese).ogg|listen}}''. This has been transliterated to "Aeris" in ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', but later as "Aerith". Both transliterations have basis, as the Japanese "su" (<U+30B9>) is used when transcribing "s" ({{IPA|/s/}}) and "th" ({{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}}) to Japanese. However, developers have stated "''Earisu''" is a (non-standard) Japanese transliteration of the English word "Earth".<ref name="kaitai">{{Cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | pages=14 | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | id=ISBN 4-7577-0098-9}}</ref>

In early planning stages of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Aerith was to be one of only three protagonists. Before this, [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Tetsuya Nomura]] decided that one character would have to die; and after creating the three characters, decided Aerith after a long debate. Nomura stated in a 2005 [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] interview: "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... [''sic''] well, that's maybe too obvious". This was not changed after other protagonists were created.<ref name="egm">{{cite web| title = Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura from Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue #196, October 2005.| url = http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| publisher = Final Fantasy VII Citadel| date = October 2005| work = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> While designing ''Final Fantasy VII'', Tetsuya Nomura was frustrated with the "perennial dramatic clich<U+00E9>" where the protagonist must dramatically sacrifice himself to express his love for someone. He found that this appeared in both [[film]]s and [[video game]]s from [[North America]] and [[Japan]]. "Is it right to set such an example to people?"<ref name="edge">{{Cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of EDGE magazine | title=EDGE May, 2003 | pages=112-113 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> Director and scenario writer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] concludes: 

{{quote|In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood.|Yoshinori Kitase|Edge Magazine, May 2003<ref name="edge" />}}

While reflecting on the game, Tetsuya Nomura claims that "Death should be something sudden and unexpected, and Aeris's death seemed more natural and realistic," and "When I reflect on ''Final Fantasy VII'', the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character."<ref name="egm" /> Rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in ''Final Fantasy VII'' or that the possibility was removed in development. "The world was expecting us to bring her back to life, as this is the classic convention". A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase. However, Kitase states that "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and that could never happen".<ref name="edge" />

==Appearances==
===''Final Fantasy VII''===
<!-- NOTE: Consensus has decided to keep her name as Aeris in the FFVII and FFT sections. Do not change it, please. -->
Aeris Gainsborough is introduced as a flower girl, when she collides into Cloud Strife, a mercenary who is fleeing from the bombing of a Mako reactor by himself and AVALANCHE. The two later meet in Aeris' church in the Sector 5 slums, where she is faced with the possibility of being captured by the [[Turks (Final Fantasy VII)|Turks]]. Aeris asks Cloud to be her [[bodyguard]] for the cost of one date. She is eventually apprehended, but once again rescued by Cloud and company. Aeris then joins them in the pursuit of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII)|Sephiroth]], while embarking on a journey of self-discovery as well.

[[Image:FFVIIsephirothkillsaeris.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sephiroth kills Aeris in an iconic scene from ''Final Fantasy VII''.]]
After a failed attempt to foil Sephiroth's theft of the Black [[Materia]], Aeris ventures alone into the [[List of Final Fantasy VII locations#Northern continent|Forgotten City]] for an unknown purpose. Cloud and his companions give chase, eventually finding her praying at an altar. As Aeris looks up to smile at Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her with a single thrust of his sword. The materia given to her by her mother, which she wore in her hair, falls from the altar into the water. After fighting an incarnation of Jenova, Cloud carries Aeris' body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases her back to the Planet.

The party later learns the reason for Aeris being in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aeris was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor.<ref name="holy">'''Bugenhagen:''' It says, when the time comes, we must search for "Holy". / '''Cloud:''' Holy? / '''Bugenhagen:''' Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square Co]] |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref><ref name="holy2">'''Cloud:''' Aeris has already prayed for Holy. ... She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here... That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square Co]] |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Though Aeris successfully casts Holy before her death, it is released too late to function as effectively as it should, for Meteor&mdash;already summoned by Sephiroth and set on a collision course with the Planet&mdash;has come too near the Planet's surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on the spell in opposite directions weakens it, leaving it with too little room to take effect.<ref name="gravity">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | pages=591 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix | id=ISBN 4-7575-1520-0}}</ref> The Planet's Lifestream then flows from within the planet and acts as a battering ram to push Meteor back, giving Holy enough room to properly destroy it. This scene is followed by a vision of Aeris within the Lifestream's energy, an indication of her final efforts to save the planet, as are detailed in ''Maiden who Travels the Planet''.

===''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children''===
[[Image:Ac-aeris-02.png|250px|thumb|left|Aerith in the credits of ''Advent Children''.]]
Aerith makes a few appearances in the CGI film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children|Advent Children]]'', as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him to move on in life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control and that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past, but acknowledging his suffering and offering kind words of support.<ref>'''Aerith:''' So, why did you come? / '''Cloud:''' I think ... I want to be forgiven, more than anything. / ... / '''Cloud:''' But I let you die... / '''Aerith:''' Dilly dally, shilly shally.

One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SHIN. She appears as the last of the party members to lend a helping hand. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement, before she and Zack turn and walk into the light.<ref>'''Aerith:''' You see? Everything's all right. {{cite video| people = [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (Director)| date2 = 2005-09-14| title = [[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]| url = | medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| time = }}</ref> Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church. It is here that a cure for Geostigma is discovered. The film's developers also acknowledge that the water is a symbolic representation of Great Gospel, Aerith's final [[Limit Break]] from the original game.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII Limit Breaks - What They Do| url = http://www.eyesonff.com/ff7/limit.php| publisher = Eyes on Final Fantasy| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref>

===Related ''Final Fantasy VII'' appearances===
''Maiden who Travels the Planet'', a novelization written by Benny Matsuyama and appearing in the ''Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> Guide'', follows Aerith immediately after her death in ''Final Fantasy VII''. The story reveals that a Cetra's strength of will and understanding of the planet allow their consciousness to exist within the Lifestream. Aerith journeys through the Lifestream, encountering characters that died in ''Final Fantasy VII''. The story confirms that in ''Final Fantasy VII'' she used the Lifestream to aid Holy in defeating Meteor, also revealing that the deceased Dyne, Zack and members of AVALANCHE assisted her as well.<!--

In ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII|Before Crisis]]'', several years before the main events of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Aerith becomes the target of [[AVALANCHE]], who seek to prevent the Shinra from being able to make use of the last Cetra. They also intend to learn the whereabouts of the Promised Land from her for their own purposes. It is then up to a member of [[Turks (Final Fantasy VII)|the Turks]] to protect her. Aerith also appears in ''Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core''. At the age of 16, Aerith met [[List of Final Fantasy VII characters#Zack|Zack]], for whom she developed feelings during his stay in Midgar.<ref name="zack">'''Aeris:''' What a shock..... I didn't know Zack was from this town. / '''Cloud:''' You know him? / '''Aeris:''' Didn't I tell you?

===Other appearances===
[[Image:KHaerith.jpg|thumb|105px|Conceptual artwork by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] for Aerith in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''.]]
Aerith's character has also appeared in games outside of the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. In ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', Aeris appears as a flower girl.<ref name="knave">'''Town Knave:''' I've been looking for you, Aeris... Selling flowers for your mom? Good for you... {{cite video game| title=[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]| developer=[[Squaresoft]] |publisher=Square Co.. |date=1997-06-20 |platform=PlayStation |language=English}}</ref> Later, a group of criminals harasses Aeris for the money that she and her mother owe, but after pleading for a postponement, Aeris is told to sell her body instead of flowers. Cloud appears and the player engages in battle with the group, letting Aeris escape. ''[[Itadaki Street Special]]'' and ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]'' feature a playable version of Aerith, as well as other ''Final Fantasy VII'' characters [[Tifa Lockhart]], [[Cloud Strife]], [[Yuffie Kisaragi]] and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII)|Sephiroth]].

Due to the allowances provided by ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' being an alternate universe independent of the continuity of ''Final Fantasy'' and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], Aerith makes an appearance in the series. She is a member of a group dedicated to defeating the [[Heartless]]; the group also includes [[Cid Highwind]] and [[Yuffie Kisaragi]], other ''Final Fantasy VII'' characters. The design of Aerith's attire had minor changes from ''Final Fantasy VII''. In the plot of ''Kingdom Hearts'', Aerith suggests and helps with a method for defeating the [[Heartless]] to protagonists [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]] and [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Throughout the game she gives advice to the player.<ref name="KHII-StrategyGuide">{{cite book| last = Hollinger| first = Elizabeth| year = 2006| title = Kingdom Hearts II Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| language = English| isbn= 0-7440-0526-4}}</ref> She also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as a perceptive figment of Sora's memories.<ref>'''Aerith:''' We don't know you, Sora, but your heart is full of memories of us together.

Aerith, Leon, and Yuffie run a restoration committee for the town of Hollow Bastion.<ref name="KHII-StrategyGuide"/>

==Musical theme==
A musical theme, or [[leitmotif]], associated with Aerith is played several times throughout ''Final Fantasy VII''. It is first heard during the flashback scenes with Aeris' mother at her house, and is repeated as she is struck down by Sephiroth. The piece ''Flowers Blooming in the Church'' is based on this theme.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII OST| url = http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html| publisher = RPG Fan| accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref> This piece is extremely popular among ''Final Fantasy'' fans, and has inspired an orchestral version, a piano version, and a vocal version performed by the artist [[RIKKI]], who also performed ''[[Suteki Da Ne]]'' for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', in the form of 'Pure Heart'. It is composed by famed ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy Symphony - Vocalists| url = http://www.ffsymphony.net/vocalists.php| publisher = Final Fantasy Symphony| accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref> A piano arrangement of the theme appears twice in ''Advent Children'', and the track "Water" also echoes shades of the theme. The opening phrase of Aeris' theme appears just prior to the climax of the track "Divinity II", which shortly after includes as its final line the Latin phrase "Sola Dea fatum novit," or "Only the goddess knows fate." "Aeris' Theme" is also featured during the end credits of the movie.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack :: Review| url = http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/group/ff7advent.html| publisher = Square Enix Music Online| accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref> Aerith's theme has been reinterpreted in the [[OverClocked Remix|OC Remix]] [[Final Fantasy VII]] compilation, [[Voices of the Lifestream]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ff7.ocremix.org/tracks/| publisher = [[OverClocked ReMix]]| title = Tracks - Final Fantasy VII: Voices of the Lifestream, an OverClocked ReMix Album| accessdate = 2007-11-17}}</ref>

==Reception==
Aerith has received an overall positive reception. WomenGamers.com stated that "you can't help but like her" and that she has a "very detailed persona and is fundamentally complex in nature."
