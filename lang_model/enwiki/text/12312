'''''Megaman Star Force''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Shooting Star Rockman'''''|<U+6D41><U+661F><U+306E><U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30DE><U+30F3>|Ry<U+016B>sei no Rokkuman|}}, is a ''[[Megaman]]'' [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] published and developed by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld [[video game console]]. It was released on December 14, 2006 in Japan, and was released in North America on August 7, 2007.

The game was released in three separate versions simultaneously, subtitled {{nihongo|'''''Pegasus'''''|<U+30DA><U+30AC><U+30B5><U+30B9>|Pegasasu}}, {{nihongo|'''''Leo'''''|<U+30EC><U+30AA>|Reo}}, and {{nihongo|'''''Dragon'''''|<U+30C9><U+30E9><U+30B4><U+30F3>|Doragon}}. However, the ''Dragon'' version is exclusive in North America to [[GameStop]] stores,<ref>{{cite web | title = Megaman Star Force Dragon Version to be Gamestop Exclusive @ On-Air | work = | url = http://onair.atomic-fire.com/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1182909298&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2& }}</ref> while in the UK, the Pegasus version is exclusive to [[Play.com]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

''Megaman Star Force'' has many similarities to the ''[[Megaman Battle Network series|Megaman Battle Network]]'' series, but is considered a separate entity. Both an [[Megaman Star Force (anime)|anime and manga]] were produced several months prior to the game's Japanese release date and are currently running in Japan. So far, only the anime has been adapted into English.

[[Megaman Star Force 2]] was released on November 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = Scans @ GoNintendo | work = | url = http://gonintendo.com/?p=16063 | accessdate = 2007-04-12}}</ref>

==Premise==
The Megaman franchise takes place in two separate timelines, one where robotic technology flourished and another where network technology prospered instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rockman Perfect Memories (<U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30D5><U+30A7><U+30AF><U+30C8><U+30E1><U+30E2><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30BA>)|id=ISBN 4575163546}} The Japanese language source book outlines the ''Classic'', ''X'', and ''Legends'' series and makes mention of the ''Battle Network'' and ''Zero'' series (which were fairly new at the time of the book's publication.) While the ''ZX'' and ''Star Force'' series were not yet conceived when the source book was published, Capcom explicitly states their placement in the timelines within the games themselves.</ref> The ''Battle Network'' series was placed in the network timeline, causing it to be completely disconnected from every other Megaman series ([[Megaman Classic|''Classic'']], [[Megaman X (series)|''X'']], [[Megaman Zero series|''Zero'']], [[Megaman ZX series|''ZX'']], and [[Megaman Legends series|''Legends'']]). ''Megaman Star Force'' explicitly states that it takes place approximately two-hundred years into the future of ''Battle Network'', thus placing it into the network timeline. As such, ''Star Force'' deviates greatly from the standard Megaman fare because it draws almost exclusively on elements from ''Battle Network'', making very few references or allusions to the other Megaman series. However, Capcom has produced ''Star Force'' as a stand-alone series, meaning players can fully enjoy the title without being familiar with the ''Battle Network'' series.

Set in the fictional year 220X,<ref>{{cite web | title = Capcom Introduces a "WAVE" New World with ''MEGA MAN STAR FORCE'' for the Nintendo DS | work = | url = http://shop.capcom.com/store/capcomus/ContentTheme/pbPage.PRFullArticle/ThemeID.166200&productID=60598400}}</ref> emphasis on internet technology has lessened, and instead, the world has become networked through use of [[Electromagnetic radiation|EM waves]]. Though cyber worlds and [[NetNavi]]s still exist in ''Star Force'', human dependency on them has greatly decreased, and people no longer have Navi companions. Three large satellites orbiting the Earth<U+2014>Pegasus, Leo, and Dragon<U+2014>power the EM Wave World that exists around the Earth's atmosphere, keeping the world networked. While the EM Wave World is normally invisible to the human eye, a special piece of eye-wear called the Visualizer (possessed by the series' protagonist) allows a human to see this other world. However, like with the cyber worlds of ''Battle Network'', EM Wave Viruses inhabit the EM Wave World, causing problems in every day life.

In ''Battle Network'', people operated [[Personal Terminal (Megaman)|PErsonal Terminals (PETs)]] to constantly interact with the network. Similar devices called [[Wave Transer|Transers]] are used in the ''Star Force'' world. Transers are compatible with Battle Cards, and when swiped through, they provide means to deleting viruses that infect the EM Wave World and other electronic devices. A group of Satella Police also exist, dedicated to stopping virus attacks and thwarting criminals who manipulate the EM Wave World in order to break the law.

Furthermore, there exists an alien planet known as "Planet FM," inhabited by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]] called FM-ians. FM-ians can traverse in both worlds, and also possess the ability to physically merge with human beings through a process called {{nihongo|"Electromagnetic Wave Change"|<U+96FB><U+6CE2><U+5909><U+63DB>|denpa henkan}}. Other than lending a human the FM-ian's powers, this process also transforms an ordinary human into an "EM Wave Human," allowing him or her to freely operate in the EM Wave World (as well as cyber networks within specific electronic devices).

The protagonist of ''Star Force'' is Geo Stelar, the son of a famous scientist and astronaut. He has an encounter with a rogue AM-ian known as Omega-Xis who takes residency in Geo's Transer. When the two go through an Electromagnetic Wave Change they form an entity that is ''eventually'' known as Mega Man.

Whereas a large focus in the ''Battle Network'' series were the NetNavis (who are mostly based on [[Robot Master]]s from the [[Mega Man (original series)|''Classic'' Mega Man]] series), ''Star Force'' focuses on FM-ians based on many real-life [[constellation]]s.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Starforce--2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot of a typical battle sequence.]]

===Battle system===
''Mega Man Star Force'' is an action RPG much in the same vein as ''Battle Network''. It is rendered in an isometric style during field gameplay, but its battle system is three-dimensional, with the battles being viewed from behind Mega Man, and movement restricted to only left and right. Since enemies have a much larger playing field, battle evasion seems limited, but the player is given a choice of techniques like shielding and homing attacks to keep battles balanced. HP represents the amount of life Mega Man has. Whenever he is hit by an attack the number decreases, and when it reaches "zero," the game is over. HP can be recovered in a number of ways, both in and out of battle.

Battle Cards are collected in a number of ways throughout the game, and the player must organize them into a folder to use for battles. Every time the "Custom Gauge" fills during battle, Cards are called up at random and are selected to use against the enemies. Depending on their arrangement on the screen, certain Cards can be selected together to provide combinations, just like Battle Chips from ''Battle Network''. There are three different classes of Cards ranked by their power and rarity (Standard, Mega, and Giga), and only a certain number of Cards from each class, or a certain number of a specific Card, can be placed into a folder. Other options allow players to set certain Cards as favorites so that by connecting to other players via Wi-Fi, they can use their favorite Cards in a random draw during battles. This implements an element of strategy into planning battles.

The player can also use their standard Mega Buster at any time to combat with, and upgrade items for Omega-Xis can be collected throughout the game to increase the Mega Buster's rate, power, and charge speed. The Mega Buster is constantly charging to release a single powerful shot, but the player can hold the button down to fire rapidly. Other battle elements include the "Best Combo" system, allowing the player to chain together attacks, easily dealing damage well up into the thousands<U+2014>''Star Force's'' version of ''Battle Network's'' "Program Advances". At the end of every battle, a player's performance is ranked on a number of factors, such as speed and amount of damage taken; The higher score, the greater the reward.

''Star Force'' also borrows the same elemental properties that ''Battle Network'' uses. The four elements include: Heat (fire-based), Aqua (water and ice-based), Elec (electricity-based), and Wood (plant and wind-based). Elements are attached to certain attacks and to enemies' (or Mega Man's) defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it is weak to, double-damage is dealt. Heat is weak against Aqua but strong against Wood, Aqua is weak against Elec but strong against Heat, Elec is weak against Wood but strong against Aqua, and Wood is weak against Heat but strong against Elec.

===Exploration===
Gameplay outside of battle typically consists of exploring areas, conversing with people and programs to progress the storyline or access side-quests for additional items. While traveling in the EM Wave World or cyber networks, battles ensue at random. The game also calls for Geo Stelar to run errands or perform tasks in order to solve problems or puzzles and push the story along, much like ''Battle Network''. However, unlike [[Lan Hikari]] of ''Battle Network'', Geo has the aid of Navi Cards, special cards that allow him to call upon NetNavis to assist him in solving problems. Throughout the course of the game, Geo collects five Navi Cards; Also, Geo may converse with Omega to get hints on what to do next.

The game also makes use of the Nintendo DS's touch-screen capabilities. Certain cyber networks require the player to interact with the touch-screen in order to progress, such as by riding mechanical bulls or dragging rockets with the pen stylus in order to hit targets.

===Other features===
''Mega Man Star Force'' consists of three versions sharing the names of the satellites: Leo, Dragon, and Pegasus, references to the constellations [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], respectively. Each version offers a separate transformation for Mega Man based on the satellites: Ice Pegasus, Fire Leo, and Green Dragon. (No elec-element transformation exists in the game.) Each transformation also has a special "Star Force Big Bang" attack that can be unleashed after countering an enemy attack.  All three transformations can be attained on any version through Brother Band. Outside of these transformations, each version has very minimalistic differences.

''Mega Man Star Force'' is compatible with [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] as well as wireless play. Through wireless play, players can trade Battle Cards and battle each other's Mega Men. Through use of Wi-Fi, players can use the Brother Band network (a play on [[broadband]]) to share favorite Cards, Star Force transformations, or status upgrades as well as send e-mails. The game also offers a complex portrait-creation process for one's Brother Band mug-shot similar to the [[decal]] creation in ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'', and a [[censorship]] filter is also implemented when creating profile information. The game allows you to have up to six "Brothers" at a time; three are open for other players through Brother Band and the other three are offered to the player from in-game characters.

[[Takara]] has released a ''Wave Scanner'' accessory which functions as an AM Radio, as well as operating much like the ''Battle Chip Gate'' released for the ''Battle Network'' games. Inserted into the Nintendo DS through the [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridge slot, players can swipe actual Battle Cards to use during battles as well as communicate with the "Wave Transer" toy, also produced by Takara. The device was released in Japan in February 2007, but like the ''Battle Chip Gate'', it is unlikely that it will be released in the U.S. The Wave Transer also functions like an [[e-Reader]] in that it allows the player to power up Mega Man by granting such bonuses as extra health.

The Game Boy Advance slot has other uses, however. Any previous ''Mega Man Battle Network'' GBA game (including ''[[Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge|Battle Chip Challenge]]'' and the Japan-exclusive ''[[Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation|Rockman EXE 4.5]]'') can be inserted to unlock a cameo appearance from [[MegaMan.EXE]] himself. He gives the player an item for Omega-Xis if a task is fulfilled for him, but then he quickly escapes back to his own time. Outside of this [[Easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]], however, there are only a few references to the events or characters from two hundred years ago.

In addition, the crossover aspect between the ''Battle Network'' and [[Konami|Konami's]] ''[[Boktai]]'' series returns in this game. Characters from ''[[Lunar Knights]]'' (''Bokura no Taiyou DS: Django and Sabata'') appear in an in-game side-quest and can become Brothers through "Cross Brother Band".<ref>{{cite web | title = <U+30AB><U+30D7><U+30B3><U+30F3><U+3068><U+FF2B><U+FF2F><U+FF2E><U+FF21><U+FF2D><U+FF29><U+3001>DS<U+300C><U+6D41><U+661F><U+306E><U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+300D><U+3068> <U+300C><U+30DC><U+30AF><U+3089><U+306E><U+592A><U+967D> Django&Sabata<U+300D><U+306E><U+30B3><U+30E9><U+30DC><U+30EC><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+58C1><U+7D19><U+3092><U+914D><U+4FE1> @ Game Watch | work = | url = http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20070126/ryubok.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-26}}</ref> This feature was removed from the US/PAL versions, as it was from ''Lunar Knights''. It's unknown why this feature was removed from the US/PAL versions.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Mega Man Star Force characters}}
[[Image:ryusei-cast.jpg|thumb|right|An image depicting many of the game's main characters. From left to right, top row: Hope, Kelvin, Aaron, Copper, Omega-Xis; bottom row: Pat, Luna, Bud, Zack, Sonia, and Geo.]]

The game stars a fifth-grade student named Geo Stelar, who can be renamed by the player, and his FM partner, Omega-Xis. Geo has been mourning the disappearance of his father Kelvin after the explosion of the space station ''Peace'' three years ago, and as a result, he has not been attending school. A group of children from Geo's class constantly urge Geo to attend school, but he always refuses. 

One day, Geo comes home and finds Aaron Boreal, Kelvin's co-worker at the AMAKEN Space Agency, conversing with Geo's mother, Hope. Aaron gives Geo the Visualizer, a glasses-like device that allows humans to see the EM Wave World. Geo goes outside to sulk on an observation deck over the city when he puts the Visualizer on. Using it, he sees Omega-Xis, who recognizes Geo as Kelvin's son and quickly performs an Electromagnetic Wave Change with him, transforming into the ''Star Force'' version of Mega Man.

Omega-Xis is considered a traitor by the FM King because he has stolen the mysterious Andromeda Key, and he also claims to know about the events leading up to Kelvin's disappearance. Geo agrees to work with Omega-Xis to protect the key, and thus, Omega-Xis resides within Geo's Transer much like Navis do in PETs. He is aided in his fight against the FMs by the three satellite Admins, Dragon, Leo, and Pegasus, who are also energy-based aliens.

The game is presented [[episode|episodically]] in this fashion, following a basic formula: enemy FMs descend to Earth and target humans with conflicted lives, promising them the power to turn things around. However, unlike the merge between Geo and Omega-Xis, these humans merge somewhat involuntarily and lose control of their bodies during the conversion. Mega Man has to defeat them in order to rescue the innocent human from the enemy FM's control. At the end of the game Mega Man has to fight the planet destroying war machine Andromeda.

==Reception==
Among the three versions of ''Star Force'', the Pegasus version is the most popular in terms of sales while the Leo version is the least popular. According to weekly sales report for ''Star Force's'' first week out, none of the three versions placed in the top 10. While Pegasus barely ranked in the top 20 by placing the 20th spot, Dragon and Leo both fell short by placing spots 23 and 26, respectively. The titles continued to plummet down to the 30th spots the following week.<ref>{{cite web | title = Weekly software sales for 12/11 - 12/17 @ Games Are Fun | work = | url = http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=7365 | accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref>

However, it is difficult to judge the accuracy of such sales reports since the game's sales are divided up between all three versions; if the sales of all three were combined, the game may have ranked higher. Furthermore, reviews from popular Japanese gaming sources, such as [[Famitsu]] gave the game an overall score of 32 out of 40,<ref>{{cite web | title=Famitsu review scores @ Go Nintendo | work | url = http://gonintendo.com/?p=9928 | accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> indicating that the games are getting good reception based on content. However, bad sales may be attributable to it having been released so closely to [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] console releases.

IGN gave ''Star Force'' a 5.2/10, their main concern being the game's lack of innovative gameplay and being almost identical to ''Battle Network''.<ref>[http://ds.ign.com/articles/812/812837p1.html  IGN]</ref> GameSpot gave the game a 6.0, citing the game's similarities to the ''Battle Network'' games as a down point, despite saying it had "minor improvements", the friend system being one of them. But the user score on GameSpot was fairly high, with Leo and Pegasus scoring 8.5 while Dragon got 8.4.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/megamanstarforce/review.html  Gamespot]</ref>

Nintendo Power, however, ranked the game a 7.5/10 for its new battle system but citing the same old look in non-battle scenes.

==Music==
The game's music was composed by Yoshino Aoki and Mitsuhiko Takano and released as the first disc of the {{nihongo|''Shooting Star Rockman 1 & 2 Original Soundtrack''|<U+6D41><U+661F><U+306E><U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+FF11><U+FF06><U+FF12><U+30AA><U+30EA><U+30B8><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30FB><U+30B5><U+30A6><U+30F3><U+30C9><U+30C8><U+30E9><U+30C3><U+30AF>|Ry<U+016B>sei no Rokkuman wan ando ts<U+016B> orijinaru saundotorakku}} compilation.
