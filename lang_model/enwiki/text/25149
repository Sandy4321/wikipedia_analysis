Following the restoration of democracy in 1975 and Spain's integration into the [[European Union]], Madrid has played an increasing role in [[Europe|European finances]], marking the city as one of the most important European [[metropolises]]. The residents of Madrid are called ''Madrile<U+00F1>os'', and the current [[mayor]] is [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallard<U+00F3>n]], of the conservative [[Partido Popular]].

See [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Madrid#Translations Wiktionary] for the name of Madrid in various languages other than English and Spanish.

==Names of the city and origin of the current name==
[[Image:Madrid GDFL040412 003.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Almudena's Cathedral, next to the Royal Palace.]]
There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the name, "Madrid". Madrid was founded by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tirenio of [[Tuscany]] and [[Mantua]]) and was named "Metragirta" or "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the original name of the city was "Ursa" ("bear" in [[Latin]]), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the [[Madrone]] tree ("madro<U+00F1>o" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), have been the emblem of the city from the Middle Ages.
Nevertherless, it is now commonly believed that the origin of the current name of the city comes from the 2nd Century B.C., when the [[Roman Empire]] established a settlement on the banks of  [[Manzanares]] river. The name of this first village was "Matrice" (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). Following the invasions of the [[Sueves]], [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] during the 5th Century A.D., the Roman Empire could not defend its territories on the Iberian Peninsula, and were therefore overrun by the [[Visigoths]]. The barbarian tribes subsequently  took control of "Matrice". In the 7th Century the [[Islamic conquest]] of the Iberian Peninsula saw the name changed to "'''Mayrit'''", from the [[Arabic]] term "Mayra" (referencing water as a "mother" or "source of life") and the Ibero-Roman suffix "it" that means "place". The modern "Madrid" evolved from the [[Mozarabic]] "Matrit", which is still in the Madrilenian [[gentilic]].<ref name="El origen del nombre">{{

==History==
{{main|History of Madrid}}

===Middle Ages===   	
Although the site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since pre-historic times, in the Roman age this territory belonged to the [[diocese]] of [[Complutum]] (present Alcal<U+00E1> de Henares). But the first historical data on the city comes from the [[9th century]], when [[Muhammad I]] ordered the construction of a small [[palace]] in the same place that is today occupied by the [[Palacio Real]]. Around this palace a small [[citadel]], al-Mudaina, was built.
Near that palace was the [[Manzanares]], which the Muslims called {{unicode|al-Majr<U+012B><U+1E6D>}} ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+062C><U+0631><U+064A><U+0637>, "source of water"). From this came the naming of the site as ''Majerit'', which was later rendered to the modern-day spelling of ''Madrid''). The citadel was conquered in 1085 by [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in his advance towards [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. He reconsecrated the [[mosque]] as the [[church]] of the Virgin of Almudena (''almudin,'' the [[garrison|garrison's]] [[granary]]). In 1329, the [[Cortes Generales]] first assembled in the city to advise [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]]. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Moors]] continued to live in the city until they were expelled at the end of the 15th century.
After troubles and a large fire, [[Henry III of Castile]] (1379&ndash;1406) rebuilt the city and established himself safely fortified outside its walls in [[El Pardo]]. The grand entry of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] to Madrid heralded the end of strife between [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].

===Renaissance===
[[Image:PuertaAlcala.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Puerta de Alcal<U+00E1>, outside el Parque del Buen Retiro, was the gate used by merchants to enter the city to sell their goods at Sunday market.]]
[[Image:madrid 13.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Comunications Palace, also known as "Casa de Correos", in Cibeles Square.]]
The [[Kingdom of Castile]], with its capital at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and the [[Crown of Aragon]], with its capital at [[Zaragoza]], were welded into modern Spain by the [[Catholic Monarchs]](Queen [[Isabella of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]). Though their grandson [[Charles I of Spain]] (also known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] favored Madrid, it was Charles<U+00B4> son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1527&ndash;1598) who moved the court to Madrid in 1561. Although he made no official declaration, the seat of the court was the de facto capital. [[Sevilla]] continued to control commerce with Spain's colonies, but Madrid controlled Sevilla. Aside from a brief period, 1601-1606, when [[Felipe III]] installed his court in [[Valladolid]], Madrid's fortunes have closely mirrored those of Spain. During the [[Siglo de Oro]] (Golden Century), in the 16th/17th century, Madrid had no resemblance with other European capitals: the population of the city was economically dependent on the business of the court itself.

===End of Renaissance and early modern Madrid===
[[Philip V of Spain|Felipe V]], Spain's first Bourbon King and, therefore, French, decided that a European capital could not stay in such a state, and new palaces (including the [[Palacio Real de Madrid]]) were built during his reign. However, it would not be until [[Carlos III of Spain|Carlos III]] (1716&ndash;1788) that Madrid would become a modern city. [[Carlos III of Spain|Carlos III]] was one of the most popular and benevolent Kings in the history of Madrid. He was popularly known at the time (and henceforth) as Madrid's best mayor. When [[Carlos IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] (1748&ndash;1819) became King of Spain, the people of Madrid revolted. After the [[Mutiny of Aranjuez]], which was led by his own son [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]] against him, [[Carlos IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] resigned, but [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII's]] reign would be short: in May 1808 [[Napoleon]]'s troops entered the city. On [[May 2]], [[1808]] (Spanish: [[Dos de Mayo]]) the ''Madrile<U+00F1>os'' revolted against the invading French army, whose brute reaction would have a lasting impact on French rule in Spain and France's image in Europe in general.

After the war of independence (1814) [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]] came back to the throne, but soon after, a liberal military revolution, [[Rafael del Riego|Colonel Riego]] made the King swear allegiance to Spain<U+00B4>s new (and first) Constitution. This would start a period where liberal and conservative  governments alternated in power, that would end with the enthronement of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1830&ndash;1904).

===The 20th century in Madrid===
[[Isabel II]] could not suppress the political tension that would lead to yet another revolt, the [[First Spanish Republic]], and the return of the monarchy, which eventually led to the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During this war (1936&ndash;1939) Madrid was one of the most affected cities of Spain and its streets became battlegrounds. Madrid was a stronghold of the [[Spanish Republic|Republicans]] from July 1936. Its western suburbs were the scene of an all-out battle in November 1936. It was during the Civil War that Madrid became the first city to be bombed by airplanes specifically targeting civilians in the history of warfare. (See [[Siege of Madrid (1936-39)]]).

During the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], especially during the 1960s, the south of Madrid became very industrialized and there were massive [[migration]]s from rural environments into the city. Madrid's south-eastern periphery became an extensive slum settlement, which was the base for an active cultural and political reform.

After the death of Franco, emerging democratic parties (including those of left-wing and republican ideology) accepted Franco's wishes of being succeeded by [[Juan Carlos I]] - in order to secure stability and democracy - which led Spain to its current position as constitutional monarchy.

Befitting from the prosperity it gained in the 1980s, the capital city of Spain has consolidated its position as the leading economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological center on the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] peninsula.

===21st century=== 
On [[11 March]] [[2004]], Madrid was hit by a [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|terrorist attack]] when terrorists placed a series of bombs on multiple trains during the rush hour, three days before the [[14 March]] [[2004]] elections. This was the worst massacre in Spain since the end of the civil war in 1939. Madrid suffered another terrorist attack, on the part of [[ETA]], [[30 December]] [[2006]]. An explosion took place in the building attached to Terminal 4 of [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]].

[[Europride]] [[2007]] ([[July 1]]) will be hosted by Madrid, [[Spain]].

Madrid has also expressed its desire to become an Olympic city, and became a candidate for the 2012 games, which were awarded to [[London 2012|London]] after Madrid was eliminated in the third round of the ballot. However, the mayor of the city has already stated that Madrid's Olympic dream did not end at [[Singapore]], as the city will again present itself as a candidate to host the 2016 Olympic games.<ref name="Madrid 2016">{{

==Economy and demographics==
====Economy from Middle Ages to 20th century====
In the Middle Ages, the village experienced a big development as a consequence of the establishment of the new capital of the [[Spanish Empire]] in Madrid. The administrative functions that it held since then, as well as the centralist character of the government found by the [[house of Bourbon]] ("Casa de Borb<U+00F3>n" in Spanish) triggered the development of the [[artisan]] activity, that turned into industrial since the middle of the 19th century, having its major expansion during the 20th century, especially after the [[Spanish Civil War]], but never reaching European levels of industrialization. The economy of the city was then centered on diverse sectors such as those related to motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, processed food, printed materials, and leather goods. Besides its many manufacturing industries.<ref name="Overview: Economy">{{cite news

====Economy from 1992 to 2006====
[[Image:Madrid_CTBA_developments.jpg|thumb|250px|left|New CTBA skyscrapers being built in Madrid.]]
Despite of the tendency of moving the production centers to industrial parks located in the outskirts of the [[metropolitan area]], the city of Madrid remains as the second most important industrial center in the country, only exceeded by [[Barcelona]].
During this period, Madrid experienced a very significant growth in its tertiary activities. In this sense, the importance of the [[Barajas Airport]] for the city's economy is remarkable, adding to the administrative and financial functions associated with being the capital of Spain. Construction (housing and public works such as the ring structure of roads and trains system) has constituted a major pillar of the economy up to 2006. Nevertheless, Madrid, like the rest of the country, is lagging behind the rest of Europe in the introduction of new technologies.<ref>http://www.talesmag.com/rprweb/the_rprs/europe/realposts_madrid.shtml</ref> In addition, inflation in Spain far above European average over this period has made Madrid and the rest of the country lose competitivity. 

Nevertherless, regarding the city's Economic environment, it has also been stated that despite the growth of the economy of the country as a whole has been moderated compared to the last two quarters, the economy of the Autonomous Region of Madrid continued to grow in the second quarter of the year, above the rate for Spain as a whole, and for the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], reaching a year-on-year increase of 4.2%. The growth outlook for the city of Madrid points to a year-on-year increase of 4.0% in 2006<ref name="Economic Barometer">{{cite news

[[Image:Demograf<U+00ED>a Madrid (Espa<U+00F1>a).PNG|thumb|right|250px|Demographics of Madrid (1900-2005)]]

The population of Madrid has experienced increase ever since the city became the national capital. This demographic [[boom]] was notorious in the 20th century due to [[domestic]] and international immigration. However, the city experienced a growth slump during the 1970s. This phenomenon, which also affected [[Barcelona]], was caused mainly by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown.

A new immigration wave has allowed Madrid not only to recover its old numbers, but to reach new historical heights. According to census data, the population of the city grew by 271,856 between 2001 and 2005.

As the capital city of [[Spain]], the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world. While less than 85% of the inhabitants are [[Spain|Spaniards]] of different backgrounds and ethnicities (almost 90% of the native Spaniards are caucasians), there are many recent immigrants who come from [[Latin America]], Europe, Asia, [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]].

The largest immigrant groups include: [[Ecuadorian]]: 83,967, [[Moroccan]]: 51,300,  [[Han Chinese|Chinese]]: 48,973, [[Colombian]]: 37,218 and [[Peruvian]]: 32,791. There are also important communities of [[Guinean]], [[Romania|Romanian]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] people.

===Names===
The natives of the city are called Madrile<U+00F1>os; they were once nicknamed ''gatos'' (cats), although nowadays the vast majority of Spaniards would not recognize the term. Its origin possibly comes from the popular [[legend]] that the conquest of the city by [[Alfonso VI]] was achieved by the assault of the walls that protected the city. Apparently the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] troops climbed the defense walls as if they were cats. Another possible source of the name is the fact that the residents were known during the Middle Ages for their ability to climb walls with their bare hands.<ref name="Madrid: the people">{{

[[Image:Clima Madrid-Barajas (Espa<U+00F1>a).PNG|thumb|250px|Madrid climate chart (Barajas)]]
The region of Madrid has a temperate [[Mediterranean climate]] with cold winters that experience temperatures lower than 0 [[<U+00B0>C]]. Summer tends to be warm with temperatures that consistently surpass 30 <U+00B0>C in July and that can often reach 40 <U+00B0>C. Due to Madrid's high altitude and dry climate, nightly temperatures tend to be cooler, leading to a lower average in the summer months. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] levels are low, but precipitation can be observed all throughout the year. Summer and winter are the driest seasons, with most rainfall occurring in the autumn and spring.

Contemporary Madrid came into its own after the death of general [[Francisco Franco]]. Years of the Franco regime left Madrid and much of the country in economic shambles due to isolation.  With his death, Madrid, and Spain as a whole, began to reassert itself on the international stage. Within Spain, reaction against the dictatorial bureaucracy centered in Madrid and a history of centralism that predated Franco by centuries has resulted in the successful modern movement towards increased [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] for the regions of Spain, considered as autonomous regions, under the umbrella of Spain.

Modern Madrid ranks as one of the most important cities in Europe.  Madrid is a leading southern European city and the most important link between the [[European Union]] and [[Latin America]].

The modern metropolis is home to over three million people. As expected with any major European capital city, each district (or [[barrio]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has its own feel.
Some of the most well-known "barrios" in Madrid are:

; Opera: As the name implies, Madrid's main Opera Theatre is the [[Teatro Real]] (Royal theatre). In front of the theatre is the [[Palacio Real de Madrid|Royal Palace]]. The Royal Palace is no longer used as a residence, but it has been kept intact since it last functioned as home to the King, serving as a cultural monument and occasionally used for state functions. The entire palace is not open to the public, but most of the more important rooms can be visited. The palace is interesting in its own right, in particular its architecture and gardens (there are two, the Jardines del Moro and the Sabattini gardens). There are also some excellent [[frescos]] inside the palace by Ti<U+00E9>polo, and paintings by [[Vel<U+00E1>zquez]], [[Goya]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[El Greco]], [[Juan de Flandes]] and [[Caravaggio]], among others.
; Alonso Mart<U+00ED>nez: This district contains the large [[Plaza de Col<U+00F3>n]]. This plaza commemorates [[Christopher Columbus]], who was responsible for ushering in the Spanish imperial golden age of the 16th and 17th centuries.  It is within walking distance of the main cultural and commercial areas of the city such as the [[Prado]] museum, the expansive [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] as well as near the business center on the lower part of the Paseo de la Castellana.
; Atocha: Atocha includes a rather large area which is bordered by the Huertas and Lavapi<U+00E9>s districts. The two important sites located in this area are the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof<U+00ED>a|Reina Sof<U+00ED>a Museum]] and the [[Atocha|Atocha Railway Station]] (which was the main object of the terrorist attacks carried out on [[March 11]], [[2004]]), one of the two main train stations in Madrid (the other one is [[Chamart<U+00ED>n]]). The area also contains a number of art galleries and restaurants serving traditional food.  This district also contains the main bus terminal as it is a central point of the city.  In addition, Atocha was the site of the [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]].

[[Image:Retiro_wim.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Parque del buen Retiro.]]
; AZCA / Nuevos Ministerios: [[Azca]] is the financial district. The area is populated by skyscrapers, among them [[Torre Picasso]] 157 m, Edificio BBVA 86 m and [[Puerta de Europa|Torre Europa]] 115 m. [[Torre Windsor]], one of the skyscrapers in this area, burnt entirely on the night between [[12 February]] and 13, 2005 [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/graficos/feb/s3/windsorfotos.html]. A very large (3 interconnected buildings) [[El Corte Ingl<U+00E9>s]] department store is also here. The area is directly linked to [[Barajas Airport]] by [[Madrid Metro|metro]] line 8 from ''Nuevos Ministerios'' station.
; [[CTBA]] (Cuatro Torres Business Arena) : The CTBA is the new financial district of Madrid, the area will be composed by four skyscrapers. The tallest of them is the [[Repsol]] tower (250m), designed by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Sir Norman Foster]]. When they finish the construction of the building, it will be the tallest skyscraper in Spain and the 3rd in Europe. The second tallest skyscraper,'Crystal Tower', is only 0'6 m lower than [[Repsol]] tower, with 249'4m, it will be the 4th tallest skyscraper of Europe. This building has being designed by [[Cesar Pelli]]. The third tallest skyscraper is the 'Sacyr-Vallehermoso' tower with 235 m and designed by Enrique Alvarez & Carlos Rubio. This building will have a 5 stars hotel in the first 31 floors and will be the 5th tallest tower in Europe. Finally, the fourth building will be 'Espacio tower'. It is 223 m long and it is designed by I.M. Pei. The four skyscrapers will be finished during 2008.<ref name="CTBA Madrid">{{cite news

; Chueca: Chueca is among the most authentic and cosmopolitan neighborhoods in the downtown city center. This district was the site of major urban decay during the early 1980s.  However, later on during the decade it became one of the most active centers of the so-called '[[Movida|La Movida]]', largely due to its new-found status as a popular [[gay village]], and has become an internationally political significant location after having held years of gay marriage and child adoption right reivindication, achieved in 2005 under socialist Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero's government. It is still quite attractive and has many good and interesting places to eat, as well as some of Madrid's most [[avant garde]] fashion and shoe shops. ''Main article: [[Chueca]]''
; Las Cortes: This district is small in size. The most important sites include Spanish parliament buildings of the lower house [[Spanish Congress of Deputies|Congreso de los Diputados]]. It also includes one of the three museums of the Madrid golden triangle, the [[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza|Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]. In addition, we find the highly ornate [[Banco de Espa<U+00F1>a]], the Caf<U+00E9> del C<U+00ED>rculo de Bellas Artes, the Zarzuela theater and the [[Plaza de Cibeles]].
[[Image:Croisement Gan Via-Alcala.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gran Via]]
; Huertas: (or Barrio de las letras) A neighborhood west of Paseo del Prado, north of Calle Atocha. Famous for being the "literary" neighborhood of Madrid where many famous writers lived or spent their free time. One of the prominent landmarks is the house of Cervantes where he died in 1616. In the last years, it became a nightlife mecca with thousands of Madrile<U+00F1>os and tourists walking around and bar-hopping along Calle de las Huertas and Plaza Santa Ana. The latter is now a major nightlife spot.
; Gran V<U+00ED>a : As the name implies, the [[Gran V<U+00ED>a]] district contains one of Madrid's most important avenues, the [[Gran V<U+00ED>a]] (literally, "Great Way"). First and foremost it is a shopping street; however it also contains a number of tourist accommodations, plenty of nightlife (all of Madrid's large [[Goth subculture|goth]] scene gravitates around Gran Via, for instance), many of Madrid's largest movie theaters and live musical shows. It is also a hub for Madrid's [[red-light district]], linking as it does many side streets. One of these streets, [[Fuencarral]] has become a link between the old shopping areas of the center of the city, the Bohemian Malasa<U+00F1>a, and the hip Chueca district, making of it one of the most cosmopolitan areas of the city.

[[Image:Plaza de-Espa<U+00F1>a En Madrid.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Edificio Espa<U+00F1>a, 117 m, built in 1953]]

; Lavapi<U+00E9>s : Traditionally one of the poorer neighborhoods near the city center, this district has maintained much of true 'Madrile<U+00F1>o' spirit of the past. Lavapi<U+00E9>s is one of the areas with a high concentration of immigrants (mainly Chinese, Arabs, Hindi, Africans and Caribbeans), and also tends to attract artists and writers adding to the cosmopolitan mix. The presence of immigrants has led to an inevitable variety of shops and restaurants - this is a good place for good and cheap restaurants of local and international food. It's also one of the best places to search for non-Spanish foodstuff, (herbs and spices etc.)
; La Latina: In and around this area are the origins of Madrid. Its difficult to put precise boundaries on La Latina, because, like its immediate neighbors, streets are narrow and winding. There are quite a few nightlife spots. There are also a number of attractive churches, like the [[Iglesia de San Andres]] and the [[Iglesia de San Francisco el Grande,]] as well as Madrid's town palace. Bordering on La Latina's east side is the famous [[Rastro]] flea-market (a prime pick-pocket spot). [[Plaza de la Paja]] is another interesting and entertaining spot of this neighborhood. On the other side, La Latina borders with Plaza Mayor and another ancient part of the town, Los Austrias, where you can find the beautiful [[Palacio Real]] (Royal Palace).
; Malasa<U+00F1>a : Malasa<U+00F1>a is a vibrant neighborhood full of lively bars and clubs overflowing with young people. Its streets are currently being renovated, making it a much more attractive quarter (the streetworks are almost finished). It's one of the classic areas for partying the night away. The area's center is the [[Plaza del Dos de Mayo]] (in commemoration of the Madrilenian popular uprising on [[May 2]], [[1808]], brutally and effectivey repressed by the French troops and which started the Spanish Independence War). Although popularly known as the [[barrio]] Malasa<U+00F1>a, the real name for the area is Universidad (University). The name Malasa<U+00F1>a comes from the 17 year old girl Manuela Malasa<U+00F1>a who once lived on the street San Andr<U+00E9>s. She was killed fighting the French in 1808. Today there is a street named in her honour very close to the roundabout 'Glorieta de Bilbao'.''Main article: [[Malasa<U+00F1>a]]''
; Retiro: Barrio Retiro is a classic neighborhood surrounding the famous Retiro Park, to the east of the center of the city. It is demographically the oldest neighborhood in the city, however over the past 5 years the increasing number of flats put for rent have been attracting young people and students to the area in growing numbers, and the diversity of the gastronomical fare in the neighborhood reflects this. The neighborhood can be characterized by the style of its three most important areas; in the north part centering on the calle Ibiza, the streets are in a grid pattern and the buildings, normally 6-10 storeys, are packed closely together, creating a bustling atmosphere of small shops, bars, and restaurants. This area is very similar to the neighborhing Salamanca neighborhood. In the south, called Ni<U+00F1>o Jesus, the area is quieter, more spacious, and residential. To the west of the park (but still included within the parameters of Barrio Retiro) is the Jer<U+00F3>nimos area, an area of beautiful 18th and 19th century buildings and many museums (including the [[Prado]]). This area, however, has few private residences, the large flats (often above 200m2) being mainly used for offices. ''Main article on Retiro Park: [[Parque del Buen Retiro|Retiro]]''
; Hortaleza: Is a residential district in the north. There's the Spanish Olympic Committee, the IFEMA (New Madrid Expo) and Juan Carlos I Park, a beautiful park between Campo de las Naciones (Commercial District inside Hortaleza) and Barajas. Mar de Cristal is the most important tube station in Hortaleza district because it's an airport connection.
; [[Vallecas]] : Vallecas is a working-class residential district in the south of Madrid.  It is also home to the [[Rayo Vallecano]] soccer team.
; Aravaca: [[Aravaca]] is an upper-class residential suburb in the northwest of Madrid. During the [[spanish civil war]] the front was stabilized here for almost three years. Aravaca and its surroundings are plenty of parks and woods like [[Casa de Campo]].

; TeleMadrid: TeleMadrid was born on [[May 2]], [[1989]] now located in the area known as 'Ciudad de la Imagen' in the outskirts of the city. Most of its programmes are focused on news regarding the Autonomous Community of Madrid as it is a channel not only for those who live in the city, but also to the people who live at the province and whose capital city is Madrid.<ref name="TeleMadrid: nuestra historia">{{cite news

===Nightlife===
[[Image:oso_madro<U+00F1>o_madrid.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Madrid's emblem: el oso y el madro<U+00F1>o, a favorite meeting place at [[Puerta del Sol]]]]Madrid is also noted for its nightlife and night clubs. On weekends, Madrilenian youth are famous for dancing all night long, stopping off only for having some ''chocolate y [[churros]]'' at dawn, go home, take a shower, shave, and go to work. It is also popular the practice of meeting in parks or streets with friends and drinking alcohol together (that is called 'botell<U+00F3>n', from 'botella', bottle), but from a few years back drinking in the street is sanctioned with a fine and now young ''madrile<U+00F1>os'' drink together all around the city instead of in some well known places. Many places host bands (concerts in Madrid [http://www.mondosonoro.com/docs_agenda/madrid/agenda.htm]). Nightlife and young cultural awakening flourished after the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], especially during the 80s while Madrid's mayor [[Enrique Tierno Galv<U+00E1>n]] was in office. This fresh movement was called ''[[la movida]]'' and it initially gathered around [[Plaza del Dos de Mayo]] (''Malasa<U+00F1>a'' area). Some of the most popular night destinations include the neighbourhoods of: Bilbao, Tribunal, Alonso Martinez or Moncloa, apart from Puerta del Sol area (including Opera and Gran Via, both adjacent to the popular square) and Huertas (barrio de Las Letras), destinations which are also filled with tourists day and night. The gay district of [[Chueca]] has also become a hot spot in the Madrilenian night life, not only for gay people but also for straights looking for fun in their crowded clubs and popular discos.

===Bullfighting===
Madrid hosts the largest Plaza de Toros (bullfighting ring) in Spain, Las Ventas, inaugurated in 1931, and where bullfighting seasons are considered the most important in the world. It has the capacity for an audience of almost 25,000. Madrid's bullfighting season begins in March and ends in October. There are bullfights everyday during the festivities of [[Isidore the Farmer|San Isidro]] (Madrid's patron saint) from the middle of March to the middle of June, and every Sunday or holiday the rest of the season. The style of the plaza is Neo[[mud<U+00E9>jar]]. Nowadays, it also hosts music concerts and other events outside of the bullfighting season.<ref name="Toreo">{{

==Universities==
===Universidad Complutense de Madrid===
[[Image:Universidad_de_Alcala.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Original building, Alcal<U+00E1> de Henares: The Complutense University was based here until 1836.]]

{{main|Complutense University of Madrid}}
The [[Complutense University of Madrid]] is the most prestigious, and largest, public university in Spain and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has 10000 staff and a student population of 117 000.It is located on two campuses, in the university quarter Ciudad Universitaria at Moncloa in Madrid, and in Somosaguas.<ref name="Universidad Complutense">{{cite news

|title=Universidad Complutense
|date=[[July 10]], [[2006]]
}}</ref>

The [[Complutense University of Madrid]] was founded in [[Alcala de Henares]], old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertherless, its real origin dates back from 1293, when King Sancho IV of Castille builds the General Schools of Alcal<U+00E1>, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University.

During the course of 1509-1510 five schools were already operative: Artes y Filosof<U+00ED>a (Arts & Philosophy), Teolog<U+00ED>a (Theology), Derecho Can<U+00F3>nico (Canonical Laws), Letras (Liberal Arts) and Medicina (Medicine).

In 1836, during the reign of [[Isabel II]], the University was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and is located at San Bernardo Street.

Subsequently, in 1927, a new university area was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King [[Alfonso XIII]] to this end.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] turned the "Ciudad Universitaria" into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage.

In 1970 the Government reforms the High Education, and the Central University become the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. It is then when the new campus at Somosaguas is created in order to house the new School of Social Sciences.

The old Alcala campus is reopened as an independent University ([[University of Alcal<U+00E1>]] in 1977).<ref name="Universidad Complutense de Madrid">{{cite news

===Universidad Autonoma de Madrid===
The [[Autonomous University of Madrid|Autonoma]], perhaps Spain's best university for research along with Complutense, was instituted under the leadership of the famous physicist, [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Cabrera]]. The Autonoma is widely recognised for its research strengths in theoretical physics.

==Transportation==
===Motorways===
The principal motorways of Madrid have a radial route. The most important are the well-known National ones:

{| class="wikitable"
! Road !! Route
|-
| [[Autov<U+00ED>a A-1|A-1]]  || Madrid-[[Aranda de Duero]]-[[Burgos]]-[[Miranda de Ebro]]-[[Vitoria]]-[[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n]]-[[Ir<U+00FA>n]]-[[France]]
|-
| [[Autov<U+00ED>a A-2|A-2]]  || Madrid-[[Zaragoza]]-[[Lleida]]-[[Barcelona]]-[[Girona]]-[[France]]
|-

|-
| [[Autov<U+00ED>a A-42|A-42]] || Madrid-[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]
|}

These free motorways operate in parallel to the 'radiales' R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 which are toll motorways built to decongest traffic in the free ones.

Moreover, Madrid also has a series of ring roads:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| M-60  || A planned new ring road of about 170 km long
|}

These [[motorway]]s are used to avoid entering the city anytime one wants to go from one point in the outskirts to the opposite one.

===Air===
[[Image:Barajas_interior5.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Barajas Airport]]
Madrid is served by [[Barajas International Airport]].  Barajas is the main [[Airline hub|hub]] of [[Iberia Airlines]].  It consequently serves as the main gateway to the Iberian peninsula from Europe, America and the rest of the world.  Current passenger volumes range upwards of 40 million passengers per year, putting it in the [[World's busiest airport|top 20]] busiest airports in the world.  Given annual increases of 10%, a new fourth terminal has been constructed. The new Terminal 4 is the biggest European airport terminal.  It has significantly reduced delays and doubled the capacity of the airport to more than 70 million passengers per year.  Two additional runways have also been constructed, making Barajas a fully operational four-runway airport.

Passengers need to add an extra half-hour to the normal check-in time as it takes a long time to walk from the check-in desk to the gate.

===National Rail===
Spain's railway system, the ''Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Espa<U+00F1>oles'' ([[Renfe]]) operates the vast majority of Spain's railways.  In Madrid, the main rail terminals are [[Atocha]] in the south and [[Chamart<U+00ED>n]] in the north.

The crown jewel of Spain's next decade of infrastructure construction is the Spanish high speed rail network, Alta Velocidad Espa<U+00F1>ola [[AVE]].  Currently, an ambitious plan includes the construction of a 7,000 km network, centered on Madrid.  The overall goal is to have all important provincial cities be no more than 4 hours away from Madrid, and no more than 6 hours away from [[Barcelona]].  As of 2005, [[AVE]] [[high-speed trains]] link Atocha station to [[Seville]] (to be extended to [[M<U+00E1>laga]] in 2007) and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in the south and to [[Zaragoza]] and  [[Tarragona]] in the east (to be extended to Barcelona at the end of 2007).

===Metro===
[[Image:Red de metro de Madrid.svg|thumb|250px|Madrid's [[metro]] map]]

[[Image:Madrid-metro-2.jpg|thumb|left|A modern metro train (type 8000).]]

Serving the city's population of some six million, the [[Madrid Metro]] is one of the most extensive and fastest-growing [[metro]] networks in the world.<ref name="Metro de Madrid">{{cite news
|url=http://urbanrail.net/eu/mad/madrid.htm
|publisher= Robert Schwandl
|title=Madrid Metro
|date=[[August 17]], [[2006]]
}}</ref> With the addition of a loop serving suburbs to Madrid's south-west "Metrosur", it is now the second largest metro system in [[Western Europe]], second only to London's [[London Underground|Underground]]. The province of Madrid is also served by an extensive [[commuter rail]] network called [[Cercan<U+00ED>as]].

===Taxi===
Unlike other cities, there are is no difference between cabs and mini-cabs, only official taxis are legal and available.

Specially in the center of the city, when you want to get a taxi you normally look for a passing by one or go to a taxi stop, instead of calling one and waiting for it.
