'''Southampton Central railway station''' is a main line railway station serving the city of [[Southampton]] in [[Hampshire]], southern [[England]].  It is on the [[Wessex Main Line]], the [[South Western Main Line]] and the [[West Coastway Line]].

The station is managed by [[South West Trains]] who operate the majority of services, including frequent trains to [[Waterloo station|London Waterloo]].  Other operators are [[CrossCountry]] (providing services to [[Birmingham]] and beyond), [[First Great Western]] (to [[Bristol Temple Meads]]) and [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]], which links Southampton to [[London Victoria]] via the south coast and [[Gatwick Airport railway station|Gatwick Airport]], and to [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] following a similar route excluding Gatwick Airport.

All the platforms are split into two sections, a and b, allowing two services to occupy a platform at the same time. Platforms 1 and 4 are, however, rarely used in this manner except when a train divides.  
*Platform 1 is used for services to [[London Waterloo]] from [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]]  and CrossCountry services to the north of England from [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]].
*Platform 2 is used for [[First Great Western]] services to  [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth]] and the stopping service to [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] via [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]].  It is the usual platform for the stopping service to London Waterloo, originating from [[Poole railway station|Poole]].
*Platform 3 is used for local services to [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]] via Redbridge (Hampshire), usually departing from platform 3b. It is also the usual platform for the [[South West Trains]] stopping service to [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station|Portsmouth]]. The Southern service from [[London Victoria]] usually terminates and departs from platform 3a. Platform 3 is also used for the stopping service to [[Poole railway station|Poole]] where it is overtaken by a faster service.
*Platform 4 is used for services to Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth as well as [[First Great Western]] services to [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]] and the West Country

There is also an ex-Red Star Parcels bay on the Bournemouth end of Platform 4. Known as Platform 5, a number of slow trains used to start from there, but they were phased out. Now it is used for stabling units, and often a Class 450 unit can be seen in there. All traces of the platform branding has, however, been removed.

A number of empty stock loops are located a short distance away allowing terminating trains to clear the platforms for through services if required, and also to allow passenger services to pass freight trains.

Southampton Central houses a [[British Transport Police]] station in Overline House on the upside, with street access from Blechyden Terrace.  

Southampton Central was flooded by torrential rainfall on [[26 May]] [[2008]]<ref>[BBC News: Flooded railway station reopens http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7420052.stm]</ref>

== Services ==
=== Rail ===
Southampton Central has three trains an hour to [[Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] of which two take approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes and the Poole stopping service taking approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes (this service is over taken by the express service at [[Eastleigh railway station|Eastleigh]]).

[[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] can be reached from Southampton Central using trains departing in both directions, by South West Trains via [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in the up and down directions and by First Great Western via the Salisbury line in the down direction only.

The service operated by Southern operates Mondays-Saturdays only.

On 9 December 2007 a number of changes were made to South West Trains, First Great Western and Southern services.  The current London Waterloo to Southampton Central stopping service has been extended to [[Poole railway station|Poole]], replacing in part the former [[Brockenhurst railway station|Brockenhurst]] to [[Wareham railway station|Wareham]] stopping service.  The former Poole train has been extended to [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]].  The [[Totton railway station|Totton]] to [[Romsey railway station|Romsey]] shuttle and the Salisbury to Southampton Central portion of the First Great Western [[Westbury railway station|Westbury]] to Southampton Central service have been replaced by a South West Trains [[Salisbury railway station|Salisbury]] to Romsey via Southampton Central and Chandlers Ford service, this calls at Romsey twice on its journey <ref>[http://www.southwesttrains.co.uk/SWTrains/News/_TimetableForDecember.htm Timetable changes for December -  South West Trains]</ref> <ref>[http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Documents/Custom/Timetables/Oct07/CardiffBristolWeymouthPortsmouthWeek.pdf   First Great Western - Draft December 07 to May 08 Timetable]</ref>.  Southern have introduced a new service from Southampton Central to [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]], the service to London Victoria now runs via  [[Horsham railway station|Horsham]] rather than via [[Hove railway station|Hove]].

In December 2008 [[CrossCountry]] launched its new timetable with most trains operating between Bournemouth and [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]], with one service originating at [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and one service on Saturdays terminating at [[Newcastle Central railway station|Newcastle]].<ref>[http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/SiteImages/Assets/3/Timetable_South_Coast_to_Manchester_North_East_and%20Scotland_Dec_08v22_.pdf CrossCountry December 2008 timetable]</ref>

=== Bus ===
The station has a free shuttle service that links the station to the city centre and on to Town Quay, for the Isle of Wight [[Red Funnel]] and [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe]] ferries.  This service is operated by [[Bluestar]] and departs from the Weymouth side of the station along with [[Uni-link]]'s other routes which serve the station. The now defunct [[City Clipper]] service also served this side, linking a number of places in Southampton City Centre to the station. This side of the station has the advantage of a turning space, so buses can come in and out, rather than just pass in either direction as on the London side. Bus services operated by [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]], [[First Hampshire & Dorset|First]], [[Stagecoach in Hampshire|Stagecoach]] and [[Wilts & Dorset]] use stops on the London side. Taxi ranks are also located on both sides of the station.

== History ==

Southampton Central station was opened as ''Southampton West'' in [[1895]], to replace the original ''Blechynden/West End'' station (note nearby road namings). It was enlarged in 1934-1935 (from two platforms to four), and became ''Southampton Central''. Soon after the closure of [[Southampton Terminus]] station near the docks in [[1966]], the station was rebuilt in [[1967]], losing its clocktower which was replaced with an office block. At this point it was renamed ''Southampton'', although many years later it was once again renamed to ''Southampton Central''.
