'''''Antennaria suffrutescens''''' is a species of flowering plant in the [[Asteraceae|daisy family]] known by the common names '''evergreen pussytoes''' and '''evergreen everlasting'''. It is native to [[Oregon]] and far northern [[California]], where it grows in [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]] in the mountains, sometimes on [[serpentine soil]]s. This is a perennial herb producing several erect stems up to about 12 centimeters tall from a woody base. The densely packed leaves at the base of the plant are spoon-shaped with notched tips, woolly on the undersides and about a centimeter long. They are evergreen, remaining on the plant through the seasons. The [[inflorescence]] atop each stem bears a single [[Head (botany)|flower head]] lined with woolly white [[bract|phyllaries]] with yellow-green bases. The species is [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]] with female plants bearing slightly larger flower heads containing [[gynoecium|pistillate]] flowers, and male plants producing [[stamen|staminate]] flowers. The fruit is an [[achene]] up to a centimeter long, most of which is a long [[pappus]] attached to a small hard body.
