==Description==

The '''Belgrave Rail Trail''' is a shared use path for [[cycling|cyclists]] and [[pedestrian]]s, which follows the [[Belgrave railway line, Melbourne|Belgrave railway line]] from [[Ringwood Lake]] to [[Belgrave railway station, Melbourne|Belgrave railway station]] in the outer eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].<ref>[http://maps.vicroads.vic.gov.au/website/bikes2b/viewer.htm VicRoads - Bicycle Facilities Map]</ref>

The trail is particularly useful as it connects to quite a few trails and is close to public transport at all points.

==Following the Path==
The path starts east of [[Eastland Shopping Centre]] where the path branches off the [[Mullum Mullum Creek Trail]]. It travels under the Ringwood Bypass, along Larissa Ave with a crossing at [[Maroondah Highway]]. The path then travels through Ringwood Lake with an easily missed right turn to a crossing of the [[Lilydale railway line, Melbourne|Lilydale railway line]].

The trail then follows the gravel access road to Bedford Road where you cross at the lights and then travel down the dead end Lena St back on to the bitumen path.

It follows the length of the railway line to Belgrave with road crossings at every road except for Forest Road past Ferntree Gully in which you travel over a high, scenic overpass.

==Connections==
Travelling downhill, from south to north, the [[Ferny Creek Trail]] is encountered first, then the [[Blind Creek Trail]], then the [[Dandenong Creek Trail]] and finally the upper [[Mullum Mullum Creek Trail]].
