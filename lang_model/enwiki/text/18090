'''Alley-Kat-Abra''' ('''Felina Furr''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], an [[anthropomorphic]] [[cat]].   Alley-Kat-Abra is a [[superhero|superheroine]] who lives on the otherdimensional world of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-C]], an alternate Earth populated by [[sentient]] [[animal]]s. Her first appearance was in ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'' #16 (February 1982).

==Fictional character biography==
Felina Furr was a [[martial arts]] instructor in the city of Mew Orleans (a parody of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]); while engaging in a meditation session, a [[meteor]] launched by [[Starro|Starro the Conqueror]] crashed into a pot with a stirring stick in it, imbuing Felina with magical powers and transforming the stick into a [[magic wand]] (which Felina called "Magic Wanda"). Teaming up with other super-powered animals affected by the meteor, Alley-Kat-Abra and the others defeated Starro (with the aid of [[Superman]]), and decided to form the superhero team called the [[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew|Zoo Crew]].

Felina tended to be a friendly person, though sometimes engaged in spats with the other female team member of the Zoo Crew, [[Yankee Poodle]].

{{spoiler}}
In ''Teen Titans'' #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006), Alley-Kat-Abra appears in a series of pages purporting to be a Zoo Crew comic published in the mainstream [[DC Universe]], and follows the adventures of the Zoo Crew teammates in a grimmer, darker version of Earth-C, parodying the recent trend toward "grim and gritty" superhero comics. In these pages, Felina is shown as having become a famous magician, but also has turned villainous; by the end of the series of pages, we see her being arrested, having been responsible for murdering teammate [[Little Cheese]] (on the principle that "cats hate mice"), and also sent teammate [[Fastback (comics)|Fastback]] into the future.
