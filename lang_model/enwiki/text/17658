'''Ali H. Soufan''' (born 1971)<ref name=Abelson /> is a [[Lebanese-American]] former [[FBI]] [[Special agent#United States of America|agent]] who was involved in a number of high-profile [[anti-terrorism]] cases both in the [[United States]] and around the world. A ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article in 2006 described Soufan as coming closer than anyone to preventing the [[September 11 attacks]], even implying that he would have succeeded had the [[CIA]] been willing to share information with him.<ref name=TheAgent /> He resigned from the FBI in 2005 after publicly chastising the CIA for not sharing information with him, which could have prevented the attacks. He is the CEO of the Soufan Group.<ref name=soufangroup /> In 2011 he published a memoir, which includes some historical background on [[al-Qaeda]]: ''The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda''.<ref name=freshair>{{cite news

==Early years==
Soufan was born in [[Lebanon]]. He is an ardent admirer of the poet [[Khalil Gibran]].<ref name=TheDarkSide /> He graduated from [[Mansfield University of Pennsylvania]] (1995), receiving his B.A in [[Political Science]]. Soufan also studied for a Masters degree in International Studies at [[Villanova University]].

==FBI career==
Soufan was called to [[Jordan]] in 1999 to investigate the [[2000_millennium_attack_plots#The_Jordan_bombing_plot|Jordan Millennium Bombing plot]], and discovered a box of documents delivered by Jordanian intelligence officials prior to the investigation, sitting on the floor of the CIA station, which contained maps showing the bomb sites. His find "embarrassed the CIA", according to a 2006 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of him.<ref name=TheAgent />

In 2000, he was made lead investigator of the [[USS Cole bombing]].<ref name=TheAgent /> When given a transcript of the interrogations of [[Fahd al-Quso]], he noticed a reference to a one-legged Afghan named "Khallad", whom he remembered as a source identified years earlier as [[Walid bin 'Attash]]; this helped the FBI to track down [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]].<ref name=TheAgent />
Following the [[September 11th attacks]], Soufan was one of eight FBI agents who spoke [[Arabic]], and the only one in [[New York]].<ref name=MissedOpportunities /> Colleagues reported that he would sit on the floor with suspects, offer them [[tea]] and argue over religion and politics in fluent Arabic, while drawing out information.<ref name=TheDarkSide />

While investigating the September 11th attacks in Yemen, Soufan received intelligence that the CIA had been withholding for months. According to ''The New Yorker'', "Soufan received the fourth photograph of the Malaysia meeting<U+2014>the picture of Khallad, the mastermind of the Cole operation. The two plots, Soufan instantly realized, were linked, and if the C.I.A. had not withheld information from him he likely would have drawn the connection months before September 11th."<ref name=TheAgent />
 
He was tasked with the "intensive interrogation" of [[Abu Jandal]] over the course of five days in Yemen, during which time Jundal gave up the names of a number of members of [[al-Qaeda]].<ref name=TheLoomingTower />

It was his questioning of [[Mohammed al Qahtani]], that led to the terrorism charges against [[Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri]] in Chicago, whom al Qahtani had mentioned being a relative.<ref name=TheDarkSide />

In 2005, Soufan approached Florida doctor [[Rafiq Abdus Sabir]] and pretended to be an Islamist militant, and asked him whether he would provide medical treatment to wounded fighters in the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=autogenerated2>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070522/ap_on_re_us/terrorism_arrest</ref> When Sabir agreed to provide medical treatment, he was arrested and sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for supporting terrorism.<ref name=autogenerated7>http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/U.S._v_Sabir_DOJPR_Sent.pdf</ref>

Soufan has been described as having had a close working relationship with [[John P. O'Neill]].<ref>[http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/09/10/podcast-show-55/ Boiling Frogs] Sibel Edmonds podcast interview with Ray Nowosielski and John Duffy of [[9/11: Press for Truth]] 51:55</ref>

===Role in Guantanamo military commissions===
Soufan obtained a confession from [[Salim Hamdan]], accused of being a driver and bodyguard for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Soufan testified before his military tribunal that Hamdan was a hardened terrorist, with advance knowledge of the [[September 11th attacks]].<ref name=CanadianPress20080729>{{cite news |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5h5XseZchc8xc1yhOaJP8dYPpfrcA |title=Guantanamo war crimes judge penalizes U.S. prosecutors in Hamdan case |publisher=[[Canadian Press]] |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=July 29, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcanadianpress.google.com%2Farticle%2FALeqM5h5XseZchc8xc1yhOaJP8dYPpfrcA&date=2008-07-29 |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref  name=GulfTimes20080723>{{cite news |url=http://www.gulfnews.com/world/Cuba/10231160.html |title='Bin Laden's driver knew hijackers aiming for attack' |publisher=[[Gulf News]] |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=July 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080725011949/http://www.gulfnews.com/world/Cuba/10231160.html| archivedate= July 25, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

He also obtained a confession from [[Ali al-Bahlul]], an al Qaeda propagandist and Bin Laden media secretary accused of making a video celebrating the Cole attacks, and testified at his military tribunal as well.<ref>[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]], [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008/10/31/story_31-10-2008_pg4_9 Guantanamo Yemeni claims al-Qaeda's "best video"], October 31, 2008</ref>

In addition he is frequently called upon to serve as an expert commentator.

===Senate testimony===

On May 14, 2009 Soufan testified in front the Senate Judicial Committee for their hearing on torture.<ref>[http://earth2obama.org/?p=590 C-SPAN videos of Ali Soufan senate testimony]</ref> The hearing followed Obama's declassification of what is known as the "torture memos,"<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/olc-memos.htm] [[United States Department of Justice|USDOJ]]: Office of Legal Counsel Memoranda</ref> and Soufan's testimony was essentially the same as an op-ed he authored for ''The New York Times'' on April 22, 2009 entitled [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html "My Tortured Decision"], which was published shortly after the memos were released.    

Most notably, he claimed in his testimony that his [[interrogation of Abu Zubaydah]] had resulted in actionable intelligence, such as the identity of convicted terrorist [[Jos<U+00E9> Padilla (prisoner)|Jos<U+00E9> Padilla]]; and that thereafter, when [[waterboarding]] was performed on [[Abu Zubaydah]], the flow of intelligence stopped. Soufan's statement is contrary to the ones made in the "torture memos," that were intent on making a legal case in favor of and justification for the use of these techniques.

Soufan re-stated this claim in a September 5, 2009, ''New York Times'' op-ed.<ref name=Soufan />

According to one of President George W. Bush's speechwriters [[Marc Thiessen]], writing in the ''[[National Review]]'' in October 2009, both Soufan's testimony and his April 2009 ''New York Times'' op-ed are contradicted by CIA documents that state that Abu Zubaydah revealed the actionable intelligence only during the CIA's interrogation, which included rougher treatment than what the FBI had used.<ref>[http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGJiYWMwMGYwNmRmOGU0NjY3NzZhYWUyNzhhMjZhOTA New Documents Show the CIA, Not the FBI, Got Zubadayh to <U+2018>Cough Up<U+2019> Jose Padilla], Marc Thiessen, ''[[National Review]]'' The Corner blog, October 31, 2009</ref> But in turn, Thiessen's argument is contradicted by the 2008 [http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0805/final.pdf Department of Justice's Inspector General Report] which quotes FBI sources stating that "Zubaydah was responding to the FBI's rapport-based approach before the CIA assumed control over the interrogation, but became uncooperative after being subjected to the CIA's techniques."

Soufan's argument was also supported by the [http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/052708/052708_Special_Review.pdf CIA Inspector General's 2004 Report] into the program. After investigating claims about the effectiveness of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EITs), the report stated that while the regular interrogation approach achieved many successes "measuring the effectiveness of the EITs, however, is a more subjective process and not without some concern." 

The Department of Justice's [http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/OPRFinalReport090729.pdf Office of Professional Responsibility report], published July 29, 2009, states that "the CIA Effectiveness Memo provided inaccurate information about Abu Zubaydah's interrogation." The CIA memo stated that "Zubaydah's reporting led to the arrest of Padilla on his arrival in Chicago in May 2003." However, the OPR report states, "In fact Padilla was arrested in May 2002, not 2003," and so "the information 'leading to the arrest of Padilla' could not have been obtained through the authorized use of EITs."

===Bloomberg op-ed criticizing Juan Rodriguez===

On May 8, 2012 ''[[Bloomberg News]]''
published an op-ed by Ali Soufan, criticizing a book recently published by former CIA official [[Juan Rodriquez]].<ref name=Bloomberg2012-05-08/>
Rodriguez's duties included supervising the CIA's torture program.  He was the official responsible for ordering the destruction of the recordings made of the torture of Al Nashiri and [[Abu Zubaydah]].

Soufan strongly disputed Rodriguez claims that the CIA's torture was effective at securing reliable, useful information.<ref name=Bloomberg2012-05-08/>

Soufan questioned whether how the marked differences in Rordriguez's description of Al Nashiri's role in the [[USS Cole bombing]] from that of the prosecution would undermine the case against al Nashiri.<ref name=Bloomberg2012-05-08/>
Rodriguez disputed that al Nashiri was the bombing's mastermind<U+2014>Rodriguez disputed that al Nashiri was intelligent enough to be a "mastermind".
