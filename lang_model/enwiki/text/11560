'''Lucania''' was an ancient district of southern [[Italy]], extending from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. To the north it adjoined [[Campania]], [[Samnium]] and [[Apulia]], and to the south it was separated by a narrow [[isthmus]] from the district of [[Bruttium]]. It thus comprised almost all the modern region of the [[Basilicata]], with the greater part of the province of [[Salerno]] (the so-called [[Cilento]]) and a portion of that of [[Cosenza]]. The precise limits were the river [[Silarus]] on the north-west, which separated it from [[Campania]], and the [[Bradanus]], which flows into the [[Gulf of Tarentum]], on the north-east; while the two little rivers [[Lao River|Laus]] and [[Crathis]], flowing from the ridge of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to the sea on the west and east, marked the limits of the district on the side of the [[Bruttii]].

==Geography==
Almost the whole is occupied by the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], here an irregular group of lofty masses. The main ridge approaches the western [[sea]], and is continued from the lofty knot of [[mountain]]s on the frontiers of [[Samnium]], nearly due south to within a few miles of the [[Gulf of Policastro]], and thenceforward is separated from the sea by only a narrow interval until it enters the district of the [[Bruttii]]. Just within the frontier of Lucania rises [[Monte Pollino]], 7325 ft., the highest peak in the southern [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. The mountains descend by a much more gradual slope to the [[coastal plain]] of the [[Gulf of Tarentum]]. Thus the rivers which flow to the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] are of little importance compared with those that descend towards the Gulf of Tarentum. Of these the most important are the Bradanus ([[Bradano]]), the Casuentus ([[Basento]]), the Aciris ([[Agri River|Agri]]), and the [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]] ([[Sinni]]). The [[Crathis]], which forms at its mouth the southern limit of the province, belongs almost wholly to the territory of the [[Bruttii]], but it receives a tributary, the [[Sybaris]] (Coscile), from the mountains of Lucania. The only considerable stream on the western side is the Silarus ([[Sele River|Sele]]), which constitutes the northern boundary, and has two important tributaries in the Calor ([[Calore Lucano]] or Calore Salernitano) and the Tanager ([[Tanagro]] or Negro) which joins it from the south.

==History==
The district of Lucania was so called from the people bearing the name [[Lucani (ancient people)|Lucani]] (Lucanians) by whom it was conquered about the middle of the [[5th century BC]]. Before that period it was included under the general name of [[Oenotria]], which was applied by the Greeks to the southernmost portion of Italy. The mountainous interior was occupied by the tribes known as [[Oenotrians]] and [[Choni]], while the coasts on both sides were occupied by powerful [[Greek colonies]] which doubtless exercised a protectorate over the interior (see [[Magna Graecia]]). The Lucanians were a southern branch of the [[Samnite]] or [[Sabellic]] race, who spoke the [[Oscan]] language. They had a democratic constitution save in time of war, when a [[dictator]] was chosen from among the regular magistrates. A few [[Oscan inscription]]s survive, mostly in [[Greek character]]s, from the 4th or 3rd century BC, and some [[coin]]s with Oscan legends of the 3rd century.<ref>see [[Robert Seymour Conway|Conway]], ''Italic Dialects'', p. II sqq.; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], ''C.I.L.'' x. p. 2I; [[Hermann Roehl|Roehl]], Inscriptiones Graecae Antiquissimae, 547.</ref> The Lucanians gradually conquered the whole country (with the exception of the Greek towns on the coast) from the borders of [[Samnium]] and [[Campania]] to the southern extremity of [[Italy]]. Subsequently the inhabitants of the peninsula, now known as [[Calabria]], broke into insurrection, and under the name of [[Bruttians]] established their independence, after which the Lucanians became confined within the limits already described. After this we find them engaged in hostilities with the [[Taranto|Tarentines]], and with [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander]], king of [[Epirus]], who was called in by that people to their assistance, 334 BC. In 298 BC (Livy x. II seq.) they made alliance with [[Rome]], and Roman influence was extended by the colonies of [[Venusia]] (291 BC), [[Paestum]] (273), and above all [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (272). Subsequently they were sometimes in alliance, but more frequently engaged in hostilities, during the [[Samnite wars]]. On the landing of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] in Italy (281 BC) they were among the first to declare in his favor, and found themselves exposed to the resentment of Rome when the departure of Pyrrhus left his allies at the mercy of the Romans. After several campaigns they were reduced to subjection (272 BC). Notwithstanding this they espoused the cause of [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]] (216 BC), and their territory during several campaigns was ravaged by both armies. The country never recovered from these disasters, and under the Roman government fell into decay, to which the [[Social War]], in which the Lucanians took part with the [[Samnites]] against [[Rome]] (90-88 BC) gave the finishing stroke. In the time of [[Strabo]] the Greek cities on the coast had fallen into insignificance, and owing to the decrease of population and cultivation the malaria began to obtain the upper hand. The few towns of the interior were of no importance. A large part of the province was given up to pasture, and the mountains were covered with forests, which abounded in wild boars, bears and wolves. There were some fifteen independent communities, but none of great importance.

For administrative purposes under the [[Roman empire]], Lucania was always united with the district of the Bruttii, a practice continued by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]].<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html <i>Cassiodorus</i>: Chapter 1, Backgrounds and Some Dates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The two together constituted the third region of [[Augustus]].

==Cities and towns==
The towns on the east coast were [[Metapontum]], a few miles south of the Bradanus; [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]], at the mouth of the Aciris; and Sins, on the river of the same name. Close to its southern frontier stood [[Sybaris]], which was destroyed in 510 ac., but subsequently replaced by [[Thurii]]. On the west coast stood [[Posidonia]], known under the Roman government as [[Paestum]]; below that came [[Elea]] or [[Velia (town)|Velia]], [[Policastro Bussentino|Pyxus]], called by the Romans Buxentum, and [[La<U+00FC>s]], near the frontier of the province towards [[Bruttium]]. Of the towns of the interior the most considerable was Potentia, still called [[Potenza]]. To the north, near the frontier of Apulia, was [[Banzi|Bantia]] ([[Acerenza|Aceruntia]] belonged more properly to Apulia); while due south from Potentia was [[Grumentum]], and still farther in that direction were Nerulum and Muranum. In the upland valley of the Tanagrus were [[Atena Lucana|Atina]], [[Forum Popilii]] and Consilinum (near [[Sala Consilina]]); Eburi ([[Eboli]]) and Volceii ([[Buccino]]), though to the north of the [[Sele River|Silarus]], were also included in Lucania. The [[Via Popilia]] traversed the district from N. to S., entering it at the NW. extremity; the [[Via Herculia]], coming southwards from the [[Via Appia]] and passing through Potentia and Grumentum, joined the [[Via Popilia]] near the S.W edge of the district: while another nameless road followed the east coast and other roads of less importance ran W. from Potentia to the [[Via Popilia]], N.E. to the [[Via Appia]] and E. from Grumentum to the coast at Heraclea.
