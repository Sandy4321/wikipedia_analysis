'''Muscat''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+0645><U+0633><U+0642><U+0637>, {{transl|ar|'''Masqa<U+1E6D>'''}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Oman]]. It is also the seat of government and largest city in the [[Muscat (governorate)|Governorate of Muscat]]. As of 2008, the population of the Muscat metropolitan area was 1,090,797.<ref>World Gazetteer</ref> The metropolitan area spans approximately {{convert|1500|km2|abbr=on}} and includes six ''[[wilayat]]s''. Known since the early 1st century [[Common Era|CE]] as an important trading port between the [[Western world|west]] and the [[Eastern world|east]], Muscat was ruled by various indigenous tribes as well as foreign powers such as the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s and the [[Portuguese Empire]] at various points in its history. A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat's influence extended as far as [[East Africa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. As an important port-town in the [[Gulf of Oman]], Muscat attracted foreign tradesmen and settlers such as the Persians, the [[Baloch people|Baloch]]s and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]]. Since the ascension of [[Qaboos bin Said]] as [[Sultan]] of Oman in 1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society.

The rocky [[Al Hajar Mountains|Western Al Hajar Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Muscat. The city lies on the [[Arabian Sea]] along the Gulf of Oman and is in the proximity of the strategic [[Straits of Hormuz]]. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the [[Mina Qaboos|port-district]] of [[Muttrah]], with its [[corniche]] and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum and porting.

Muscat hosted the [[2010 Asian Beach Games]] in December.

==Etymology==
[[Ptolemy]]'s ''Map of Arabia'' identifies the territories of ''Cryptus Portus''<ref name="Foster 1844, p.231">Foster (1844), p.231.</ref> and ''Moscha Portus''.<ref>Foster (1844), p.241.</ref> Scholars are divided in opinion on which of the two related to the city of ''Muscat''. Similarly, [[Arrian]]us references ''Omana'' and ''Moscha'' in ''Voyage of Nearchus''. Interpretations of Arrianus' work by [[William Vincent (Dean)|William Vincent]] and [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] conclude that ''Omana'' was a reference to ''Oman'', while ''Moscha'' referred to ''Muscat''.<ref>Foster (1844), p.173.</ref> Similarly, other scholars identify [[Pliny the Elder]]'s reference to ''Amithoscuta'' to be ''Muscat''.<ref name="Foster 1844, p.231"/>

The origin of the word ''Muscat'' is disputed. Some authors claim that the word has [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origins &ndash; from ''moscha'', meaning an ''inflated hide'' or ''skin''.<ref>Foster (1844), p.173</ref> Other authors claim that the name ''Muscat'' means ''[[anchorage]]'' or ''the place of "letting fall the anchor"''.<ref>Miles (1997), p.468.</ref> Other derivations include ''muscat'' from [[Old Persian]], meaning ''strong-scented'',<ref>Hailman (2006), p.49.</ref> or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] meaning ''falling-place'',<ref>Philips (1966), p.4.</ref> or meaning ''hidden''.<ref>Room (2003), p.246.</ref>
Maas-gat in the old Persian means "fishing place" (''Moscha Portus''). Even Masandam means "massan (fishes)+ dam (net)" in the old Persian. ''Cryptus Portus'' is synonymous with Oman ("hidden land"). But "Ov-man" (Omman) and the old sumerian name Magan (Maa-kan) means sea-people in Persian and Arabic.

==History==
Evidence of communal activity in the area around Muscat dates back to the 6th millennium [[Before Common Era|BCE]] in Ras al-Hamra, where burial sites of fishermen have been found. The graves appear to be well formed and indicate the existence of burial rituals. South of Muscat, remnants of [[Harappa]]n pottery indicate some level of contact with the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].<ref>Rice (1994), p.255-256</ref> Muscat's notability as a port was acknowledged as early as the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]] by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographers [[Ptolemy]], who referred to it as ''Cryptus Portus'' (the ''Hidden Port''), and by [[Pliny the Elder]], who called it ''Amithoscuta''.<ref>Foster (1844), p.234.</ref>

The port fell to a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] invasion in the 3rd century CE, under the rule of [[Shapur I]].,<ref>Potter (2002), p.41.</ref> while conversion to Islam occurred during the 7th century. Muscat's importance as a trading port continued to grow in the centuries that followed, under the influence of the [[Azd|Azd dynasty]], a local tribe. The establishment of the First [[Imamate]] in the 9th century CE was the first step in consolidating disparate Omani tribal factions under the banner of an [[Ibadi]] state. However, tribal skirmishes continued, allowing the [[Abbasid]]s of [[Baghdad]] to conquer Oman. The Abbasids occupied the region until the 11th century, when they were driven out by the local Yahmad tribe. Power over Oman shifted from the Yahmad tribe to the [[Azd]]i Nabahinah clan, during whose rule, the people of coastal ports such as Muscat prospered from maritime trade and close alliances with the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the cost of the alienation of the people of the interior of Oman.

{{Pquote|Muscat is a large and very populous town, flanked on both sides with high mountains and the front is close to the water's edge; behind, towards the interior, there is a plain as large as the square of Lisbon, all covered with salt pans. [T]here are orchards, gardens, and palm groves with wells for watering them by means of swipes and other engines. The harbour is small, shaped like a horse-shoe and sheltered from every wind.|[[Afonso de Albuquerque]], after the fall of Muscat, in 1507.<ref name="Miles 1997, p.147">Miles (1997), p.147.</ref>}}
[[File:Muscat harbor.jpg|thumb|220px|Muscat harbour, ca. 1903. Visible in the background is Fort Al Jalali.]]
The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] conqueror [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] attacked Muscat in July, 1507. A bloody battle ensued between the Portuguese and forces loyal to the Persian governor of the city. After the fall of the town, Albuquerque massacred most of the remaining inhabitants &ndash; men, women and children, following which the town was occupied and pillaged.<ref name="Miles 1997, p.147"/> 
[[File:WH1-Effo080a.jpg|thumb|left|Muscat harbor during World War I]]The Portuguese maintained a hold on Muscat for over a century, despite challenges from [[Persia]] and a bombardment of the town by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in 1546.<ref>Miles (1997), p.167</ref> The Turks twice captured Muscat from the Portuguese, in the [[Capture of Muscat (1552)]] and 1581-88. The election of Nasir bin Murshid al-Yaribi as Imam of Oman in 1624 changed the balance of power again in the region, from the Persians and the Portuguese to local Omanis. On August 16, 1648 the Imam dispatched an army to Muscat, which captured and demolished the high towers of the Portuguese, weakening their grip over the town. Decisively, in 1650, a small but determined body of the Imam's troops attacked the port at night, forcing an eventual Portuguese surrender on January 23, 1650.<ref>Miles (1997), p. 196.</ref> A civilian war, and repeated incursions by the Persian king [[Nadir Shah]] in the 18th century destabilised the region, and further strained relations between the interior and Muscat. This power vacuum in Oman led to the emergence of the [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Sa<U+2018>id dynasty]], which has ruled Oman ever since.<ref>Miles (1997), p.256.</ref>
[[File:Oman-Muscat-16-Sultans-Palace-2.JPG|thumb|left|Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said]] Palace in Muscat]]
Muscat's naval and military supremacy was re-established in the 19th century by [[Said bin Sultan]], who gained control over [[Zanzibar]], eventually moving his capital to Stone Town, the ancient quarter of Zanzibar City, in 1840. However, after his death in 1856, control over Zanzibar was lost when it became an independent sultanate under his sixth son, [[Sayyid Majid bin Said]] (1834/5<U+2013>1870), while the third son, [[Sayyid Thuwaini bin Said]], became the Sultan of Oman.
During the second half of the 19th century, the fortunes of the Al Bu Sa`id declined and friction with the Imams of the interior resurfaced. Muscat and [[Muttrah]] were attacked by tribes from the interior in 1895 and again in 1915.<ref>JE Peterson's Britannica entry (1990), p.6.</ref> A tentative ceasefire was brokered by the [[British East India|British]], which gave the interior more autonomy. However, conflicts among the disparate tribes of the interior, and with the Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]] continued into the 1950s, and eventually escalated into the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] (1962). The rebellion forced the Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] to seek the assistance of the British in quelling the uprisings from the interior. The April 26, 1966 failed assassination attempt on Said bin Taimur led to the further isolation of the Sultan, who had moved his residence from Muscat to [[Salalah]], amidst the civilian armed conflict. On July 23, 1970, [[Qaboos bin Said]], son of the Sultan, staged a bloodless<ref>Long (2007), p.188.</ref>''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]'' in the Salalah palace with the assistance of the British, and took over as ruler.

With the assistance of the British, Qaboos bin Said put an end to the Dhofar uprising and consolidated disparate tribal territories. He renamed the country the ''[[Sultanate of Oman]]'' (called ''Muscat and Oman'' hitherto), in an attempt to end to the interior's isolation from Muscat. Qaboos enlisted the services of capable Omanis to fill positions in his new government,<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.126.</ref> drawing from such corporations as [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO). New ministries for social services such as health and education were established. The construction of [[Mina Qaboos]], a new port conceived initially by Sa`id bin Taimur, was developed during the early days of Qaboos' rule. Similarly, a [[Muscat International Airport|new international airport]] was developed in Muscat's [[Seeb]] district. A complex of offices, warehouses, shops and homes transformed the old village of [[Ruwi]] in Muttrah into a commercial district.<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.128</ref> The first five-year development plan in 1976 emphasised infrastructural development of Muscat, which provided new opportunities for trade and tourism in the 1980s &ndash; 1990s, attracting migrants from around the region. On June 6, 2007, [[Cyclone Gonu]] hit Muscat caused extensive damage to property, infrastructure and commercial activity.

==Geography==
[[File:Road towards Qantab, Muscat.jpg|thumb|Muscat's rugged terrain, with plutonic [[Western Al Hajar Mountains]] dotting the landscape]]
[[File:Intermission in Mutrah.jpg|thumb|The [[Muttrah]] [[Corniche]] at night]]
Muscat is located in northeast Oman, at {{Coord|24|00|N|57|00|E}}. The [[Tropic of Cancer]] passes south of the area. It is bordered to its west by the plains of the [[Al Batinah Region]] and to its east by [[Ash Sharqiyah Region (Oman)|Ash Sharqiyah Region]]. The interior plains of the [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region]] border Muscat to the south, while the [[Gulf of Oman]] forms the northern and western periphery of the city. The water along to coast of Muscat runs deep, forming two natural [[harbour]]s, in [[Muttrah]] and Muscat. The [[Al Hajar Mountains|Western Al Hajar Mountains]] run through the northern coastline of the city.

[[Volcanic rock]]s are apparent in the Muscat area, and are composed of serpentine and [[diorite]], extending along the Gulf of Oman coast for ten or twelve {{convert|16|km|mi}} from the district of Darsait to Yiti.<ref>Miles (1997), p.399.</ref> [[Pluton|Plutonic rocks]] constitute the hills and mountains of Muscat and span approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Darsait to Ras Jissah. These [[igneous rock]]s consists of [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], [[Greenschist|greenstone]] and [[basalt]], typical of rocks in Southeastern regions of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. South of Muscat, the volcanic rock strata is broken up and distorted, rising to a maximum height of {{convert|6000|ft|m}}, in [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region|Al Dakhiliyah]], a region which includes [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]], the country's highest range. The hills in Muscat are mostly devoid of vegetation but are rich in [[iron]].

The [[halophytic]] ''[[sabkha]]'' type desert vegetation is predominant in Muscat.<ref>Ghazanfar (1998), p.80.</ref> The [[Qurum]] Nature Reserve contains plants such as the ''Arthrocnemum Macrostachyum'' and ''[[halophyte|Halopeplis Perfoliata]]'' [[Coral reef]]s are common in Muscat. ''[[Acropora]]'' reefs exist in the sheltered bays of the satellite towns of Jussah and Khairan.<ref>Salm (1993), p.52</ref> Additionally, smaller ''[[Porites]]'' reef colonies exist in Khairan, which have fused to form a flat-top pavement is visible at low tide. [[Crab]]s and [[crayfish|spiny crayfish]] are found in the waters of the Muscat area, as are [[sardine]]s and [[bonito]].<ref>Miles (1997), p.410.</ref> [[Asiatic glassfish|Glassfish]] are common in freshwater [[estuary|estuaries]], such as the Qurum Nature Reserve.<ref>Barth (2002), p.292.</ref>

The Al Sultan Qaboos Street forms the main artery of Muscat, running west-to-east through the city. The street eventually becomes Al Nahdah Street near [[Al Wattayah]]. Several inter-city roads such as Nizwa Road and Al Amrat Road intersect with Al Sultan Qaboos Road (in [[Rusail]] and [[Ruwi]], respectively). [[Muttrah]], with the Muscat Harbour, [[Corniche]], and [[Mina Qaboos]] is located in the north-eastern coastline of the city, adjacent to the Gulf of Oman. Other coastal districts of Muscat include Darsait, Mina Al Fahal, Ras Al Hamar, Al Qurum Heights, Al Khuwair and Al Seeb. Residential and commercial districts further inland include Al Hamriyah, Al Wadi Al Kabir, Ruwi, Al Wattayah, [[Madinat Qaboos]] and [[Al Azaiba]].

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Muscat}}
Muscat features a hot, [[arid climate]] with long and very hot summers and warm "winters". Annual [[rainfall]] in Muscat is about 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in), falling mostly in March. In general precipitation is scarce in Muscat, with several months on average seeing only a trace of rainfall. The climate generally is very hot, with temperatures reaching as high as 40<U+00B0>C (104<U+00B0>F) in the summer.

==Economy==
[[File:MSM outdoor.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Muscat Securities Market]] in Central Business District]]
Muscat's economy, like that of Oman, is dominated by trade. The more traditional exports of the city included [[Date (fruit)|dates]], [[mother of pearl]], and fish. Many of the [[souk]]s of Muttrah sell these items and traditional [[Omani]] artefacts. [[Petroleum Development Oman]] (PDO) has been central to Muscat's economy since at least 1962 and is the country's second largest employer, after the government. PDO's major shareholders include [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]], Total, and Partex and its production is estimated to be about {{convert|720000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Muscat also has major trading companies such as [[Suhail Bahwan]], which is a trading partner for corporations such as [[Toshiba]], [[Subaru]], [[Seiko]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[RAK Ceramics]]; [[Saud Bahwan Group]] whose trading partners are [[Toyota]], [[Daihatsu]] and [[Hertz Rent-a-Car]]; and Zubair Automotive whose trading partners include [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Chrysler]] brands such as Dodge. The private Health Care sector of Muscat,Oman has numerous hospitals and clinics.

The [[Muscat Securities Market]] is the principal stock exchange of Oman. It is located in Central Business District of Muscat and it was established in 1988, and has since distinguished itself as a pioneer among its regional peers in terms of transparency and disclosure regulations and requirements.

Mina Sultan Qaboos, Muscat's main trading port, is a trading hub between the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Far East with an annual volume of about 1.6 million tons. However, the emergence of the [[Jebel Ali Free Zone]] in neighboring [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], has made that port the premier maritime trading port of the region with about 44 million tons traded in cargo annually. Many infrastructural facilities are owned and operated by the government of Oman. Omantel is the major telecommunications organization in Oman and provides local, long-distance and international dialing facilities and operates as the country's only [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]]. Recent liberalization of the mobile telephone market has seen the establishment of a second provider &mdash; Nawras.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Demographics==
[[File:Grand Central Mosque Muscat.jpg|thumb|The [[Zawawi Mosque]] in Al Khuwair, Muscat. A majority of Omanis are [[Ibadhi]] [[Muslim]]s.]]According to the 2003 [[census]] conducted by the Oman Ministry of National Economy, the population of Muscat is over 630,000, which included 370,000 males and 260,000 females.<ref name="Oman Census 2003, p.6">Oman Census (2003), p.6.</ref> Muscat formed the second largest governorate in the country, after [[Al Batinah Region|Al Batinah]], accounting for 27% of the total population of Oman. As of 2003, [[Omani]]s constituted 60% of the total population of Muscat, while expatriates accounted for about 40%.<ref>Oman Census (2003), p.9.</ref> The [[population density]] of the city was 162.1

The governorate of Muscat comprises six ''[[wilayat]]s'' &ndash; [[Muttrah]], Bawshar, [[Seeb]], Al Amrat, Muscat and [[Qurayyat, Oman|Qurayyat]]. Of the ''wilayats'', Seeb, located in the western section of the governorate, was the most populous (with over 220,000 residents), while Muttrah had the highest number of expatriates (with over 100,000).<ref name="Oman Census 2003, p.6"/> Approximately 71% of the population was within the 15-64 age group, with the average Omani age being 23 years.<ref>Oman Census(2003), Data and Other Indicators</ref> About 10% of the population is [[literacy rate|illiterate]], an improvement when compared to the 18% illiteracy rate recorded during to 1993 census. Expatriates accounted for over 60% of the [[labour force]] dominated by males, who accounted for 80% of the city's total labour. A majority of expatriates (34%) engineering-related occupations, while most Omanis worked in engineering, clerical, scientific or technical fields. The [[Royal Army of Oman|defense]] sector was the largest employer for Omanis, while construction, [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade employed the largest number of expatriates.

The ethnic makeup of Muscat has historically been influenced by people not native to the Arabian Peninsula. [[British Parliament]]ary papers dating back to the 19th century indicate the presence of a significant [[Hindu people|Hindu]] [[Gujarat]]i [[merchant]]s in the city<ref>British Parliamentary Papers (1876), p.189.</ref> Indeed, four [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temples]] existed in Muscat ca. 1760 <ref>Kechichian (1995), p.215.</ref> [[Christianity]] is thought to have been brought in by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1507.<ref>Fahlbusch (1999), p.829.</ref> [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] established a hospital in Muscat in the 19th century.

Like the rest of Oman, [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] is the predominant language of the city. In addition, [[English (language)|English]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[South Asia]]n languages such as [[Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Urdu]] <ref>Peterson (2004), p.34.</ref> are spoken by the residents of Muscat. [[Islam]] is the predominant religion in the city, with most followers being [[Ibadi]] [[Muslim]]s. Non-Muslims are allowed to practice their religion, but may not [[proselytize]] publicly or distribute religious literature.

==Notable landmarks==
[[File: Muscat Oman.jpg|thumb|right]]The city has two [[Hindu temple]]s &ndash; a [[Shiva]] temple and a [[Krishna]] temple. Christians, too have built their churches here on a multi-denominational [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] in [[Ruwi]]. The beautiful city has numerous mosques including the [[Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque]], [[Ruwi Mosque]] and [[Zawawi Mosque]]. A few Shi'ite mosques also exist here.

Muscat has a number of museums. These include [[Museum of Omani Heritage]], [[National Museum of Oman]], [[Oman Children's Museum]], [[Oman Natural History Museum]], [[Bait al Zubair]], [[Oman Oil and Gas Exhibition Centre]], [[Omani French Museum]], [[Sultan's Armed Forces Museum]] and the [[Omani Aquarium and Marine Science and Fisheries Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/entert/museums.asp?cat=tour&subcat=entert1|title=Museums
|publisher=Omanet.om|accessdate=January 18, 2009}}
</ref> The [[Bait Al Falaj Fort]] played an important role in Muscat's military history.

Several new projects are being planned including an [[opera house]] , a grand mall and several new hotels.(some of these projects have already been launched)
One of the most notable projects is the Oman National Museum. It is expected to be an architectural jewel along with the [[Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque]].

==Transport==
[[File:Taxis before Ruwi mosque.JPG|thumb|An orange and white taxi in front of a mosque in [[Ruwi]].]]The main [[airport]] is [[Muscat International Airport]] around {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from the city's business district of Ruwi and 15 to 20&nbsp;km from the main residential localities of Al-Khuwair, Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos, Shati Al-Qurm and Al-Qurm. Muscat is the headquarters for the local [[Oman Air]], which flies to several destinations within the [[Middle East]], the Indian Subcontinent and East Africa. Other airlines such as [[Sri Lankan]], [[Royal Jordanian]], [[British Airways]], [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]], [[Jet Airways]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Emirates Airline|Emirates]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]], [[Kuwait Airways]], [[Air India]] and [[Thai Airways International|Thai Airways]] also fly through Muscat International Airport.

The Muscat area is well serviced by paved roads and [[dual-carriageway]] connects most major cities and towns in the country. Public transportation in Muscat does not include rail, and bus services are limited in their route coverage. There is no rail or metro network in the country. Several forms of public transport are popular in Oman. Most popular are the "Baiza" buses, so named for the lower denomination of the [[Omani Rial]], the baiza (an adaptation of the [[India]]n lower denomination [[paisa]]). These are relatively inexpensive and service all major roadways, as well as a wide and loose network of smaller byways in the greater Muscat metropolitan area, opportunistically dropping off and picking up passengers at any location. Less popular and slightly more expensive are large public buses, coloured red and green, whose service is limited to major roadways and point-to-point travel routes between Oman's major cities and towns. Taxis, also colour-coded orange and white, provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baiza buses.

Baiza buses and colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of [[negotiation]], although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger's newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi. Taxis will also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including [[Sohar]], [[Buraimi]] and [[Dubai]].
