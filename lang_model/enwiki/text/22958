'''Tropical Storm Becky''' was the second [[tropical cyclone]] and named storm of the [[1970 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Becky formed from a tropical depression that was designated on July 19. The next day it organized over the [[Yucatan Channel]] and became Tropical Storm Becky. Initially thought to have attained minimal hurricane status, Becky reached peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), but the storm began to deteriorate shortly thereafter. The storm made landfall on the [[Florida Panhandle]] on July 22, and rapidly weakened over land. Overall, damage was related to heavy rainfall that caused flooding in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]; 104 families suffered flood-related losses. Further north, the heavy rainfall led to rivers rising. Becky may have been responsible for spawning tornadoes that destroyed or damaged several houses.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Becky 1970 track.png}}
On July 16, 1970, a large disturbance separated from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] near [[Panama]]. The broad area of convection dominated the region between [[Swan Island]] and western [[Cuba]] by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the coast of Africa on July 9.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neil Frank|title=Atlantic Tropical Systems of 1970|year=1971|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/099/mwr-099-04-0281.pdf}}</ref> Regardless of the origins, on July 19 the system was designated a tropical depression. As the depression moved through the [[Yucatan Channel]], the [[atmospheric convection|convective]] cloud system became better organized. On July 20, in light of data from a [[Reconnaissance Aircraft]] flight, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Becky.<ref name="prelim1">{{Cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Becky Preliminary Report Page 1|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1970-prelim/becky/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

The storm moved roughly northward under the influence of the [[Bermuda High]] to the east and a [[low pressure area]] over Mexico.<ref name="prelim1"/> Reports from a Reconnaissance flight indicated that Becky was disorganized, with a minimum barometric pressure of 1008 mb.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Cyclone Discussion Storm Becky|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/tropdisc/tcd2103z.jpg}}</ref> Although a fairly strong low-level circulation developed, there was insufficient warming of the center to produce significant falls in barometric pressure at the [[surface weather analysis|surface]]. Late on July 20, a ship reported a minimum pressure of about 1003 mb, and another ship reported sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), Becky's peak intensity. A Reconnaissance flight and [[doppler radar]]s suggested the development of an [[eye (cyclone)|eye feature]]. Initially, it was believed that the storm attained minimal [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane status]], though it was later confirmed that Becky remained a tropical storm. Additionally, the previously forming eye failed to persist.<ref name="perlim2">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Becky Preliminary Report Page 2|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1970-prelim/becky/prelim02.gif}}</ref>

On July 21, the storm deteriorated in organization as it continued northward.<ref name="prelim3">{{Cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Becky Preliminary Report Page 3|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1970-prelim/becky/prelim03.gif}}</ref> The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kraft|title=Tropical Cyclone Discussion Storm Becky|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/tropdisc/tcd2209z.jpg}}</ref> The storm made landfall near [[Port St. Joe, Florida]] shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly as it moved inland; as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into [[Kentucky]].<ref name="prelim3"/>

==Preparations==
Offshore, [[Shell Oil]] removed some workers and equipment from offshore platforms. A [[hurricane warning]] was issued from Fort Walton, Florida to [[Port St. Joe, Florida]]. Similarly, a gale warning was posted for coastal areas of [[Alabama]] and Florida. A hurricane watch was issued for locations in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Hurricane Becky Threatens|year=1970|publisher=''Las Cruces Sun-News''|accessdate=2008-11-15|url=http://thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=55188796_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref> On July 22, a [[tornado watch]] was posted for northern Florida.<ref>{{cite web|author=Holm|title=July 22 Special Weather Statement|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/local/tlh222000z.jpg}}</ref> [[Tornado warnings]] were also issued,<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Tornado Waring Bulletin|year=1970|publisher=Savannah, Georgia Weather Bureau|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/local/sav221822z.jpg}}</ref> and a [[flash flood watch]] was declared for parts of western [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=|title=Statement on flash flood watch in western North Carolina|year=1970|publisher=Raleigh Durham Airport|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/local/rah231000z.jpg}}</ref> [[Gale warning]]s were posted from [[Panama City, Florida]] to [[St. Marks, Florida]], with the expectation of winds to {{convert|50|mph|km/h}}.

==Impact==
Upon making landfall, a barometric pressure of 1007 mb accompanied the storm. Along the coast of the Panhandle, gale-force winds and tides of {{convert|3|ft|m}} above-normal were reported. [[Tallahassee, Florida]] received {{convert|8|in|m}} of rainfall; due to the heavy precipitation, serious flooding occurred.<ref name="prelim3"/> At Anna Marie Island in Florida, heavy rainfall and squalls accompanied by winds of {{convert|56|mph|km/h}} were reported.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Post event report|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/postevent/attn_tpa.jpg}}</ref> In South Carolina, heavy precipitation led to rivers approaching [[flood stage]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Flood Bulletin|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/postevent/flood_cae221600z.jpg}}</ref> Locally heavy rainfall caused rivers to rise in North Carolina, though they remained below flood stage. Along the [[Cape Fear River]], a boat ramp was washed out.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=River Statement|year=1970|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0031-jpg/1970/atlantic/becky/postevent/river_rah221500z.jpg}}</ref> Farther towards the north in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]], the rainfall helped to relieve persistent drought conditions.<ref name="prelim3"/>

According to the [[Red Cross]], 104 families in the Tallahassee region suffered flood-related losses, and two injuries were reported. There, winds gusted to {{convert|44|mph|km/h}}. Flood waters were knee-deep around a county courthouse at [[Crawfordville, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Weakened Becky Drenches State|year=1970|publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''|accessdate=2008-1-16|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mPsNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BnwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6719,1250179&dq=tropical+storm+becky+1970}}</ref> In low-lying areas, flooding damaged homes, and to the southwest of Tallahassee, {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water forced the evacuation of 15 homes by rowboat.

Several [[tornado]]es were reported. Near [[Panacea, Florida]], a [[tornado]] destroyed a house and damaged two others. Another tornado in [[Emanuel County, Georgia]] killed one person and demolished two homes. However, due to the conditions that spawned the tornadoes, they are not directly attributed to Becky.<ref name="prelim3"/>
