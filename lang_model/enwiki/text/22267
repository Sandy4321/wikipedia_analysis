'''Howard Leslie Shore''' (born October 18, 1946) is a [[Canadian]] [[composer]], notable for his film scores.  He has composed the scores for over 40 films, most notably the scores for ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, for which he won three Academy Awards.  He is also a consistent collaborator with director [[David Cronenberg]], having scored all but one of his films since 1979. Shore has also worked with [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[David Fincher]] and many other filmakers.

He has also composed a few concert works including one [[opera]], ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]'', based on the plot (though not his score) of Cronenberg's [[The Fly (1986 film)|1986 film]] premiered at the [[Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre du Ch<U+00E2>telet]] in Paris on 2 July 2008.,<ref>[http://www.theflytheopera.com/ LA Opera's announcement of the operatic production]</ref> a short piece Fanfare for the Wanamaker Organ and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and a short overture for the Swiss 21st Century Symphony Orchestra.

Shore is a three-time winner of the [[Academy Award]], and has also won two [[Golden Globe Awards]] and four [[Grammy Awards]]. He is the uncle of film composer [[Ryan Shore]].<ref>[http://www.newsaskew.com/graves-interview-ryan-shore NewsAskew Interview]</ref>

==Early life and career==
Shore was born in [[Toronto, Ontario, Canada]], the son of Bernice (n<U+00E9>e Ash) and Mac Shore.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/61/Howard-Shore.html</ref> He studied music at [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] after graduating from [[Forest Hill Collegiate Institute]]. From 1969 to 1972, he performed with the group [[Lighthouse (band)|Lighthouse]]. In 1970 he was the music director of [[Lorne Michaels]] and Hart Pomerantz's short-lived TV program ''The Hart & Lorne Terrific Hour''. Shore wrote the music for Canadian magician [[Doug Henning]]'s magical/musical ''Spellbound'' in 1974, and he was the musical director for Lorne Michaels' hugely influential late-night NBC comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band, and dressed as a beekeeper for a [[John Belushi]]/[[Dan Aykroyd]] performance of the [[Slim Harpo]] classic ''[[I'm a King Bee]]''. Shore also suggested the name for [[The Blues Brothers]] to Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi.

==Film scoring==
===1979<U+2013>2000===
Shore's first film score was to [[David Cronenberg]]'s first major film ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979).  He would go on to score all but one of Cronenberg's subsequent films, with the exception of [[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]] (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]].  The first film he scored that was not directed by Cronenberg was [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]''.

Following ''After Hours'', he scored ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), again directed by Cronenberg.  Two years later, he composed the score to ''[[Big]]'' (1988), directed by [[Penny Marshall]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]].  He then scored two more of David Cronenberg's films: ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' (1988) and ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' (1991).

During 1991, Shore composed the score for the highly acclaimed film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', starring [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], and directed by [[Jonathan Demme]].  He received his first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nomination for the score.  The film became the third (and most recent) to win the five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress).  Shore is the only living composer to have scored a "Top Five" Oscar winning film.

During 1993, he composed the scores for ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'' (another collaboration with Cronenberg), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (his second collaboration with Jonathan Demme), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]].  The latter two films were highly successful; ''Philadelphia'' winning [[Tom Hanks]] his first Oscar.

Shore scored another three films in 1994: ''[[The Client (film)|The Client]]'', ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', and ''[[Nobody's Fool (1994 film)|Nobody's Fool]]''.  ''Ed Wood'' is notable for being one of the two films directed by Tim Burton that did not feature a score by [[Danny Elfman]].

Shore continued to score numerous films from 1995<U+2013>2001, including another two collaborations with Cronenberg and Tom Hanks' directorial debut; ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.

===2001<U+2013>2005===
Shore's major success came in 2001 with his score to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the first film in the highly acclaimed ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]''.  The news that Shore would score the trilogy surprised some, since he was primarily associated with dark, ominous films and had never scored an epic of this scale.  However, the score was hugely successful and won Shore his first Oscar, as well as a Grammy Award, and nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA.

The following year, Shore composed the scores to ''[[Panic Room]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (replacing [[Elmer Bernstein]] and collaborating with Martin Scorsese for the first time in nearly twenty years), and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', the second film in the trilogy.  The latter two films were both nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], although neither won.  Shore's score for ''The Two Towers'' was deemed ineligible for submission to the Academy, due to a new rule that disallowed the submission of scores which contained themes from previous work.  This rule proved very unpopular, due to the fact that had it been present in earlier years, it would have invalidated various other sequel scores (such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'') from being nominated.  As a result the Academy dispensed with this rule for future years.  Shore did, however, receive a BAFTA nomination for ''Gangs of New York''.

In 2003 he composed the score for the final film in ''The Lord of the Rings trilogy'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.  The film was the most successful film in the trilogy and the most successful of the year.  Shore won his second Oscar for Best Original Score, as well as a third for Best Original Song for "Into the West", which he shared with [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Annie Lennox]].  The film was nominated for, and won a total of eleven Academy Awards, a record for the number of Oscars won by a single film, and a record that only two other films<U+2014>[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]] (1997) and [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]] (1959)<U+2014>have matched.  Shore also won his first Golden Globe, his third and fourth Grammy (the fourth for Best Song), and was nominated for a third BAFTA.  The scores of ''The Lord of the Rings'' became one of the most successful film scores ever written, and the biggest success in Shore's career.

In 2004, Shore again collaborated with Martin Scorsese, scoring his epic film ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''.  He won a second Golden Globe for the score, becoming the first, and to date, the only, composer to have won consecutive Golden Globes in the Original Score category.  He also received his sixth Grammy nominations, and his fifth BAFTA nomination.

He collaborated again with David Cronenberg in 2005 to score ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'', starring Viggo Mortensen.  The film was a success and received two Oscar nominations.  In 2006, he collaborated for the fourth time with Martin Scorsese, this time to score ''[[The Departed]]''.  The film was highly successful and won four Oscars, including a long awaited win for Scorsese, and Best Picture.

Although Shore was originally commissioned to compose the soundtrack for ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (indeed, he had already recorded most of the music), he was later replaced by [[James Newton Howard]] due to "differing creative aspirations for the score" on his and the filmmakers' parts. This was a mutual agreement between himself and [[Peter Jackson]].  Despite this, Shore has a cameo near the end of ''King Kong'' as the [[conducting|conductor]] of the [[pit orchestra]] in the theater, performing portions of [[Max Steiner]]'s score to the ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|original 1933 version]]'' of the film.

===2006<U+2013>Present===
In 2007, he composed the music for ''[[Soul of the Ultimate Nation]]'', an online multiplayer video game.  The soundtrack is notable for being the first video game soundtrack to feature [[Lydia Kavina]] on the [[theremin]].  During 2007 he also composed the scores to ''[[The Last Mimzy]]'', and ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', the latter of which was another collaboration with David Cronenberg and earned Shore his fourth Golden Globe nomination.  In 2008 he scored ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'', starring Meryl Streep and directed by [[John Patrick Shanley]].  The film was a success, earning five Oscar nominations.

In 2010, Shore composed the score to the ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse|third installment]]'' in the highly popular [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|''Twilight'' film series]], following [[Carter Burwell]] and [[Alexandre Desplat]], who scored the first and second films, respectively.  He also replaced [[John Corigliano]] to score ''[[Edge of Darkness (2010 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'', starring [[Mel Gibson]].

Shore's next two projects are ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', continuing his long-term collaboration with director David Cronenberg.  He will also compose the score to Martin Scorsese's ''[[Hugo Cabret]]'', which will be his fifth collaboration with Scorsese.  Both films are currently in post-production.

Shore's future projects include [[Robert Sigl]]'s ''The Spider'' <ref>{{IMDb title|1138464|The Spider}}</ref> and [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Hobbit film project|The Hobbit]]'',<ref name="musicoflotr1">{{cite news|title=Why NZ Matters |url=http://www.musicoflotr.com/2010/10/why-nz-matters.html|accessdate=November 1, 2010|date=October 27, 2010|author=Doug Adams|work=The Music of The Lord of the Rings Films}}</ref> both of which are currently in pre-production.  He is also set to compose the music to ''Sinatra'',<ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232205/fullcredits</ref> and ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt'',<ref name="autogenerated2">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480046/fullcredits</ref> both of which are being directed by Martin Scorsese and are due for release in 2011.

Since 2004, he has toured the world [[conducting]] local [[orchestra]]s in the performance of his new [[symphony|symphonic]] arrangement of his highly acclaimed ''[[Music of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings]]'' scores. The new work is entitled ''The Lord of the Rings: Symphony in Six Movements''. There are two movements for each of the movies, and an [[intermission]] between the second and third (or first and second, in some cases) movements. The concert presentation of the symphony also includes projected still images relating the music being performed to scenes from the films. Recently, however, Shore has been busy with other projects, leaving other conductors including Markus Huber, Alexander Mickelthwaite, and [[John Mauceri]] to lead the orchestras.
April 24, 2008 marked the North American Live to Projection debut of ''Fellowship of the Ring'', with the score performed live by the [[Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by Ludwig Wicki. Wicki also conducted the Filene Center Orchestra at the Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Virginia on May 21 and 22, 2008 in the U.S. premiere of the Fellowship of the Ring Live to Projection. 
September 16, 2010 Shore conducted the RSO Vienna (Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra) which performed "In Dreams from The Fellowship of the Ring" at [[Hollywood in Vienna]] in Vienna, Austria.
