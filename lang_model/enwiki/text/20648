An historic snowstorm struck the [[Ohio Valley]] of the United States, as well as Ontario in Canada, on December 22 and December 23 and is not the same storm that led to snow in Texas on [[2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm|Christmas Eve]].  It lasted roughly 30&nbsp;hours, and brought snowfall amounts up to 37&nbsp;inches (73.7&nbsp;cm) to portions of the Midwestern [[United States]].  Damages from the storm totaled US$900&nbsp;million (2004&nbsp;dollars).  A total of 18 died during the storm, one from Canada, mainly due to car accidents.

==Synoptic history==
An arctic cold front moved through the Midwest, bringing cold air into the region and a brief 4-10&nbsp;hour burst of snowfall on December 22.  Thereafter, 3<U+2013>6&nbsp;hours of freezing rain and sleet fell.  The second bout of wintry precipitation, which lasted about 13&nbsp;hours, was caused by a surface [[cyclone]] in the southern stream of the Westerlies which moved northeast from the coastal bend of [[Texas]] early on December 22, moving across northern [[Louisiana]], southeast [[Arkansas]], northwest [[Mississippi]], then across central [[Tennessee]], through western [[West Virginia]] early on December 23, eastern [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

==Effects==
Over {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow fell across portions of southern Illinois and central Ohio.  A band of freezing rain and sleet led to ice and sleet accumulations across western [[Tennessee]], central [[Kentucky]], as well as southern and eastern [[Ohio]].  Traffic was paralyzed across the region by plane, train, and automobile, during this [[winter storm]].  Interstate and state highways turned into parking lots as over 100,000 vehicle accidents were caused by the weather.  Roofs of buildings caved in under the weight of the ice and snow, especially in areas which measured over 10&nbsp;inches of snow.  Almost a million residences saw power outages and numerous phone lines were downed.  Four days of sub-freezing temperatures during and after the storm hampered recovery efforts.  States of emergency were declared in Kentucky, Illinois, and Ohio.
===United States===
====Arkansas====
High winds and icing were the main impact in [[Arkansas]].  About 11,000 customers lost power for 2<U+2013>3&nbsp;days. Six perished during the storm statewide.
====Tennessee====
About 23,000 customers were without power during the storm.
====Kentucky====
A snowfall record was set at Paducah, when {{convert|14|in|cm}} was measured. A major ice storm struck central portions of the state.  After the storm, a record low was set on Christmas Day when the temperature fell to {{convert|-8|F|C}} at Paducah.  A total of 168,000 customers experienced power failure.  Two perished statewide.

====Illinois====
It was the most significant snowstorm on record for southern sections of the state.  Snowfall records were set at Carbondale ({{convert|12|in|cm}}), McLeansboro ({{convert|14|in|cm}}), and Carmi ({{convert|18|in|cm}}).  [[Interstate 64]] was blocked for three days.

====Indiana====

Snowfall records were set in many locations across the Hoosier state.  The records above {{convert|20|in|cm}} included Evansville ({{convert|22.3|in|cm}}), Seymour ({{convert|29|in|cm}}), North Vernon ({{convert|26|in|cm}}), Crothersville ({{convert|37|in|cm}}), and Greensburg ({{convert|24|in|cm}}).  After the storm, a record low was set at Evansville on Christmas Day when the temperature fell to {{convert|-11|F|C}}.  This combination of factors closed Interstate 64 for three days and Interstate 94 for over two days (reopening Christmas Eve).  Five perished statewide.
