The '''Silkie''' (sometimes alternatively spelled ''Silky'') is a [[List of chicken breeds|breed]] of [[chicken]] named for its atypically fluffy [[plumage]], which is said to feel like [[silk]]. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as dark blue flesh and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in [[poultry]] shows, and exist in several colors including red, buff, blue, grey, black, white, and many mottled variations.

In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. Among the most docile of poultry, Silkies are considered an ideal pet. Hens are also exceptionally [[Broodiness|broody]], and make good mothers. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species. Silkies come in both a full-sized and diminutive forms, the latter being typically known as '''Silkie Bantams'''.

==History==
It is unknown exactly where or when fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared, but the most well documented point of origin as ancient China. Other places in [[Southeast Asia]] have been named as possibilities, such as India and [[Java]].<ref name="Ekarius">{{harv|Ekarius|2007|p=158}}</ref> The earliest surviving written account of Silkies comes from [[Marco Polo]], who wrote of a furry chicken in the 13th century, during his travels in Asia.<ref>{{harv|Graham|2006|p=130}}</ref> In 1599, [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], a writer and [[naturalist]] at the [[University of Bologna]], [[Italy]], published a comprehensive [[treatise]] on chickens which is still read and admired today. In it, he spoke on "wool-bearing chickens" and ones "clothed with hair like that of a black cat".<ref>{{harv|Smith|Daniel|1975|p=49}}</ref>

Silkies most likely made their way to the West via the [[Silk Route]] and maritime trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance in to the [[Standard of Perfection]] in 1874.<ref name="Ekarius" /> Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and [[Domestic rabbit|rabbits]],<ref name="Graham">{{harv|Graham|2006|p=130}}</ref> while [[sideshow]]s promoted them as having actual mammalian [[fur]].<ref>{{harv|Percy|2002|p=37}}</ref>

In the 21st century, Silkies are one of the most popular and ubiquitous ornamental breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like [[Domestic duck|ducks]] and [[Domestic goose|geese]] and [[game birds]] such as [[quail]] and [[pheasants]].<ref name="Ekarius" />

==Characteristics==
Silkies are often mistakenly called a [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] breed, and although some countries do consider them a bantam, this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam sized, but in Europe the large is the original version. However, even "large" Silkies are relatively small chickens, with standard bantam size males weighing only four pounds (1.8 kg), and females weigh three pounds (1.36 kg).<ref name="Graham" /> The [[American Standard of Perfection]] calls for males that are 36 ounces (1 kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910&nbsp;grams).<ref>{{harv|Ekarius|2007|p=159}}</ref>

Silkie plumage is unique among [[List of chicken breeds|chicken breeds]]; Silkie-like feathering may appear as a recessive [[mutation]] in individuals of other varieties, but no other true breed has it. It has been compared to silk,<ref name="Louie">{{harv|Louie|2007}}</ref> and to fur. Their feathers lack functioning [[Barbule|barbicels]], and are thus similar to [[Down feathers|down]] on other birds and leave Silkies unable to fly. The overall result is a soft, fluffy appearance.<ref name="Ekarius_a">{{harv|Ekarius|2007|pp=158<U+2013>159}}</ref>

Silkies appear in two distinct varieties: Bearded and Non-bearded. Bearded Silkies have an extra muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, splash and white. Alternative hues, such as Cuckoo, Red, and Lavender, also exist. All Silkies have a small Walnut-type [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], dark [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]], and [[turquoise]] blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the [[Dorking (chicken)|Dorking]], [[Faverolles (chicken)|Faverolles]], and [[Sultan (chicken)|Sultan]].<ref name="Graham" />

All Silkies have black skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their [[Chinese language]] name is ''wu gu ji'' (<U+70CF><U+9AA8><U+96DE>,<ref>{{cite book |last = Dunlop | first = Fuchsia | authorlink = Fuchsia Dunlop | title = Land of Plenty | publisher = [[W. W. Norton & Company]] | year = 2003 | pages = 236,372 | isbn = 0-393-05177-3 }}</ref> literally "dark boned chicken"), meaning "black-boned chicken".<ref name="Louie" /> Melanism which extends beyond the skin into an animal's [[connective tissue]] is a rare trait, and the Silkie is one of only a handful of chickens to exhibit it. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce as much as the more common meat breeds of chicken.<ref name="Ekarius_a" />

Silkies lay a fair number of cream-colored eggs, but production is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go [[Avian incubation|broody]]; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been [[selectively bred]] out of most egg-laying fowl, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.<ref>{{harv|Graham|2006|p=131}}</ref>

===Bantams===
The Silkie bantam is a miniature variety of the Silkie, which is similar to the large Silkie in almost every way, except for size. In some countries, the Silkie bantam is the only or more common variety of Silkie, such as North America, where the bantam variety is the most popular. However in Australia the Silkie bantam is almost unknown, despite being standardised.

In the [[American Standard of Perfection]] the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1 kg (36 oz) and for the female, 907 g (32 oz).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansilkiebantamclub.org/standard.asp|title=Bantam Silkie Standard|publisher=American Poultry Association}}</ref> The [[Australian Poultry Standard]] and [[British Poultry Standard]] call for Silkie bantams much smaller; in the Australian Poultry Standard, the standard weights are 680 g (25 oz) for males and 570 g (20 oz) for females.<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Poultry Standard|publisher=Victorian Poultry Association| date=1998}}</ref> The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22 oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18 oz).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesilkieclubofgreatbritain.co.uk/index.php?section=15|title=British Poultry Standard for Silkies|publisher=British Poultry Association}}</ref>

==In cuisine==
[[File:<U+70CF><U+96DE><U+6E6F>.JPG|thumb|Silkie soup sold in [[Bukit Batok]], [[Singapore]]]]
The black meat of a Silkie is generally considered an unusual or unpalatable attribute in European and American cuisines.<ref name="Louie" /> In contrast, several Asian cuisines consider Silkie meat a gourmet food. [[Chinese cuisine]] especially values the breed, but it is also a common ingredient in some Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Korean dishes. Areas where Chinese cuisine has been a strong influence, such as [[Malaysia]], may also cook Silkie. As early as the 7th century, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] has held that [[chicken soup]] made with Silkie meat is a [[Chinese food therapy|curative food]].<ref name="Louie" /> The usual methods of cooking include using Silkie to make [[broth]], [[braising]], and in [[curry|curries]]. Traditional Chinese soup made with Silkie also uses ingredients such as [[Wolfberry|wolfberries]], ''[[Dioscorea opposita]]'' (white yam), [[Zest (ingredient)|orange peel]], and fresh [[ginger]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/dining/174rex.html |title=Recipe: Black-Skinned Chicken Soup |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> A few [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] restaurants in metropolitan areas of the West have also cooked it as a part of traditional American or [[French cuisine]], such as in [[confit]].<ref name="Louie" />
