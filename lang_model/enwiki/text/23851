'''''Unknown''''' (also known as '''''Unknown Worlds''''') was an American [[pulp magazine|pulp]] [[fantasy fiction magazine]], published from 1939 to 1943 by [[Street & Smith]], and edited by [[John W. Campbell]].  ''Unknown'' was a companion to Street & Smith's science fiction pulp, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines.  The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was ''[[Weird Tales]]'', which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than ''Weird Tales'', and put his plans into action when [[Eric Frank Russell]] sent him the manuscript of his novel ''Sinister Barrier'', about aliens who own the human race. ''Unknown''{{'}}s first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to ''Sinister Barrier'', it included [[H. L. Gold]]'s "Trouble With Water", a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome.  Gold's story was the first of many in ''Unknown'' to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.

Campbell required his authors to avoid simplistic horror fiction and insisted that the fantasy elements in a story be developed logically: for example, Jack Williamson's "Darker Than You Think" describes a world in which there is a scientific explanation for the existence of [[werewolf|werewolves]].  Similarly, [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]]'s [[Harold Shea]] series, about a modern American who finds himself in the worlds of various mythologies, depicts a system of magic based on mathematical logic.  Other notable stories included several well-received novels by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and short stories such as [[Manly Wade Wellman]]'s "When It Was Moonlight" and [[Fritz Leiber]]'s "Two Sought Adventure", the first in his [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] series.

''Unknown'' was forced to a bimonthly schedule in 1941 by poor sales, and cancelled in 1943 when wartime paper shortages became so acute that Campbell had to choose between turning ''Astounding'' into a bimonthly or ending ''Unknown''.  The magazine is generally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published, despite the fact that it was not commercially successful, and in the opinion of science fiction historian [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] it was responsible for the creation of the modern fantasy publishing genre.

==Background and publication history==

Campbell was editor throughout.<ref name=Tuck_U>"Unknown Worlds", in Tuck, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, Vol. 3'', pp. 582<U+2013>583.</ref>]]In May 1923, the first issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]'' appeared, from Rural Publications in Chicago. ''Weird Tales'' was a pulp magazine that specialized in fantasy stories and material that no other magazine would accept. It was not initially successful, but by the 1930s had established itself and was regularly publishing science fiction (sf) as well as fantasy.<ref name=SFFWFM_WT>Robert Weinberg, "Weird Tales", in Tymn & Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines'', pp.&nbsp;727<U+2013>736.</ref>  ''Weird Tales'' was the first magazine to focus solely on fantasy, and it remained the pre-eminent magazine in this field for over a decade.<ref name=TTM_41>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;41.</ref><ref name=TTM_140/>  In the meantime, science fiction was starting to form a separately marketed genre, with the appearance in 1926 of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', a pulp magazine edited by [[Hugo Gernsback]]. In 1930 pulp publisher Clayton Publications launched ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Stories of Super Science]]'',<ref name=TTM_69>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;69.</ref> but the company's bankruptcy in 1933 led to the acquisition of the magazine by [[Street & Smith]].<ref name=TTM_82>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', p.&nbsp;82.</ref> The title was shortened to ''Astounding Stories'', and it became the leading magazine in the science fiction field over the next few years under the editorship of [[F. Orlin Tremaine]].<ref name=TTM_84-5>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;84<U+2013>85.</ref><ref name=SFFWFM_ASF>Albert I.

Campbell]] took over as editor.<ref name=SFFWFM_ASF/>

By 1938, Campbell was planning a fantasy companion to ''Astounding'':<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> ''Weird Tales'' was still the leader in the fantasy genre, though competitors such as ''[[Strange Stories]]'' were also being launched.<ref name=TTM_140/>  Campbell began acquiring stories suitable for the new magazine, without a definite launch date in mind. When [[Eric Frank Russell]] sent him the manuscript of his novel ''Sinister Barrier'', Campbell decided it was time to put his plans into action.  The first issue of ''Unknown'' appeared in March 1939. It was a monthly at first, but poor sales forced a switch to a bimonthly schedule beginning in February 1941.<ref name=SFFWFM_U>Thomas D.

==Contents and reception==
[[File:Unknown December 1939 cover.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edd Cartier]]'s cover for the December 1939 issue]]
Campbell's plans for ''Unknown'' were laid out in the February 1939 issue of ''Astounding'', in the announcement of the new magazine. He argued that "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... [''Unknown''] will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term".<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's ''Sinister Barrier'',{{#tag:ref|Russell's original title was ''Forbidden Acres''.<ref name=TTM_140/>|group=note}} the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race,<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy".<ref name=TTM_140>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;140<U+2013>141.</ref> Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in ''Unknown''; in Ashley's words, Campbell "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy".<ref name=TTM_140/>  The first issue also contained [[Horace L. Gold]]'s "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, "Trouble with Water" was a better indication than ''Sinister Barrier'' of the direction ''Unknown'' would take.<ref name=ESF_U/>  Campbell commented in a letter at the time that ''Sinister Barrier'', "Trouble with Water", and {{" '}}Where Angels Fear ...{{' "}} by [[Manly Wade Wellman]] were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.<ref name=TJWCL_44>Chapdelaine, ''John W. Campbell Letters'', p.&nbsp;44.</ref>{{#tag:ref|In the letter, to early contributor [[L. Ron Hubbard]], Campbell asks Hubbard for a story with an [[Arabian Nights]] theme and comments that "Death Sentence" by [[Robert Moore Williams]] and "Dark Vision" by [[Frank Belknap Long]] are next in quality, while "Who Wants Power?" by Mona Farnsworth and "Closed Doors" by A. MacFadyen Jr. were merely "filling space ... acceptably".<ref name=TJWCL_44/>|group=note}}

Under Campbell's editorial supervision, the fantasy element in ''Unknown'' stories had to be treated rigorously.<ref name=ESF_U/>  This naturally led to the appearance in ''Unknown'' of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction stories, and Campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular contributors, many of whom were also appearing in the pages of ''Astounding''.<ref name=ESF_U/>  [[L. Ron Hubbard]], [[Theodore Sturgeon]], and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] were among the most prolific.<ref name=SFFWFM_U/><ref name=ESF_U/>  Hubbard contributed eight lead novels including  ''[[Typewriter in the Sky]]'', ''[[Slaves of Sleep]]'', and ''[[Fear (novella)|Fear]]'', described by Ashley as a "classic psychological thriller";<ref name=ESF_U/> sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson describes all eight as "outstanding".<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> De Camp, in collaboration with [[Fletcher Pratt]], contributed three stories featuring [[Harold Shea]], who finds himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules.<ref name=SFFWFM_U/><ref name=EF_U>Mike Ashley, ''Unknown'', in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', p.&nbsp;974.</ref> The title of one of these, "The Mathematics of Magic", is, according to sf critic [[John Clute]], "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in ''Unknown''".<ref name=EF_LSDC>John Clute, "Lyon Sprague de Camp", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', pp.&nbsp;257<U+2013>258.</ref>

[[File:Unknown February 1942 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover for the February 1942 issue<U+2014>an example of the more dignified cover layout that was adopted in July 1940]]Other ''Astounding'' writers who wrote for ''Unknown'' included [[Robert A. Heinlein]], whose "The Devil Makes the Law" (reprinted as "[[Magic, Inc.]]") depicts a world where magic is a part of normal everyday life.<ref name=ESF_U/> Heinlein also contributed "[[The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag]]" and "[[They (Heinlein)|They]]", described by Ashley as "perhaps the ultimate solipsist fantasy".<ref name=ESF_RAH>Mike Ashley, "Robert A. Heinlein", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', p.&nbsp;406.</ref> [[A.E. van Vogt]], a frequent ''Astounding'' contributor, appeared in the final issue with "The Book of Ptath" (later expanded into a novel).<ref name=ESF_U/><ref name=issues/>  [[Isaac Asimov]], despite multiple attempts to write for ''Unknown'', never appeared in the magazine.  On his sixth attempt, he sold "[[Author! Author! (short story)|Author! Author!]]" to Campbell, but the magazine was cancelled before it could appear.<ref name=IMYG_380>Asimov, ''In Memory Yet Green'', pp.&nbsp;380, 390.</ref>  It eventually appeared in the anthology ''The Unknown Five''.<ref name=Tuck_Bensen/>

In addition to the overlap between the writers of ''Unknown'' and ''Astounding'', there was a good deal of overlap between their readership:<ref name=TCOT_25>Carter, ''Creation of Tomorrow'', pp.&nbsp;25<U+2013>26.</ref> Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines.<ref name=IMYG_379>Asimov, ''In Memory Yet Green'', p.&nbsp;379.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Asimov regarded ''Unknown'' as his favorite magazine and always kept up to date reading it, while he might be several issues behind on reading ''Astounding''.<ref name=IMYG_379/>|group=note}} Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that in fact the spectrum of fantastic fiction from ''Weird Tales'' through ''Unknown'' to ''Astounding'' was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as ''Wonder Stories'' were more like the works of [[Edgar Allen Poe]] than they were tales of scientific imagination.<ref name=TCOT_25/>

[[Fritz Leiber]]'s first published story was "Two Sought Adventure", which appeared in the August 1939 issue of ''Unknown''; this was the first story in his long-running [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] series about a pair of adventurers in a [[sword and sorcery]] setting. Four more Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories appeared in ''Unknown'' in as many years, and Leiber's novel ''[[Conjure Wife]]'', about a man who discovers that all women are secretly witches, was the lead story in the April 1943 issue. The protagonist, a university professor, "is forced to abandon scepticism and discover the underlying equations of magic, via symbolic logic", in critic David Langford's description.<ref name=ESF_FRL>David Langford, "Fritz Leiber", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', pp.&nbsp;573<U+2013>574.</ref> Leiber also contributed "Smoke Ghost" in October 1941, described by Ashley as "arguably the first seriously modern ghost story".<ref name=EF_U/>  Another writer whose first story appeared in ''Unknown'' was [[James H. Schmitz]], whose "Greenface" appeared in the August 1943 issue.<ref name=issues/><ref name=TWOSF_113>del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;113.</ref>

Other notable stories that appeared in ''Unknown'' include Jack Williamson's "Darker Than You Think" (December 1940), which provides a scientific basis for a race of werewolves living undetected alongside human beings. Expanded into a novel in 1948, it remains Williamson's best-known fantasy, and sf historian [[Malcolm Edwards]] comments that the two protagonists' relationship is "depicted with a tortured (and still haunting) erotic frankness unusual in genre literature of the 1940s".<ref name=TTM_140/><ref name=EF_JW>John Clute, "Jack Williamson", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', p.&nbsp;1018.</ref> In addition to the Harold Shea pieces, de Camp published several other well-received stories, including "The Wheels of If" (October 1940) and "[[Lest Darkness Fall]]" (December 1939), an [[alternate history]] story about a time-traveler who attempts to save the Roman Empire from the coming dark ages; Edwards and Clute comment that the story is "the most accomplished early excursion into history in magazine sf, and is regarded as a classic".<ref name=EF_LSDC/><ref name=ESF_LSDC>Malcolm Edwards & John Clute, "L. Sprague de Camp", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;308<U+2013>310.</ref>  Also highly regarded is Wellman's "When It Was Moonlight" (December 1940), a story about Poe.<ref name=TTM_140/>

The first sixteen issues of ''Unknown'' had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style was changed to a table of contents, with a small ink drawing usually accompanying the summary of each story, in an attempt to make the magazine appear more dignified.<ref name=ESF_U/><ref name=issues>See the individual issues. For convenience, an online index is available at {{Cite web| url = http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Magazine:Unknown | title = Magazine:Unknown&nbsp;<U+2014> ISFDB | accessdate=13 February 2011 |publisher=Al von Ruff (Publisher)}}</ref> The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by [[Harold Winfield Scott|H. W. Scott]]; [[Manuel Islip]], [[Modest Stein]], [[Graves Gladney]], and [[Edd Cartier]] provided the others. Cartier was the only one of these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of ''Unknown''{{'}}s last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.<ref name=TTM_A4>Ashley, ''Time Machines'', pp.&nbsp;266<U+2013>282.</ref>

==Influence==
[[File:Cartier Fear illo Unknown July 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by Edd Cartier for L. Ron Hubbard's "Fear" (July 1940)]]''Unknown'' was, along with ''[[Weird Tales]]'', an important early influence on the fantasy genre.<ref name=EF_U/>   In the foreword to ''From Unknown Worlds'', in 1948, Campbell commented that fantasy before ''Unknown'' had been too much infused with "gloom and terror"; his approach in ''Unknown'' had been to assume that the "creatures of mythology and folklore" could be characters in an amusing tale as easily as they could be made part of a horror story. Horror stories, he said, had a place, but "horror injected with a sharp and poisoned needle is just as effective as when applied with the blunt-instrument technique of the so-called Gothic horror tale".  Campbell insisted on the same rational approach to fantasy that he required of his science fiction writers, and in the words of Clareson, this led to the destruction of "not only the prevalent narrative tone but also most of the trappings that had dominated fantasy from ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' and ''[[The Monk]]'' through the nineteenth century to ''Weird Tales''".<ref name=SFFWFM_U/>  ''Unknown'' quickly separated itself from ''Weird Tales'', whose fantasies still primarily aimed to produce fear or shock.  The closest predecessor to ''Unknown'' was [[Thorne Smith]], whose [[prohibition-era (US)|prohibition-era]] "Topper" stories also mixed fantasy with humor.<ref name=EF_U/>  Before ''Unknown'', fantasy had received little serious attention, though on occasion writers such as [[James Branch Cabell]] had achieved respectability.<ref name=EF_U/> In Ashley's opinion, ''Unknown'' created the modern genre of fantasy,<ref name=EF_U/> though commercial success for the genre had to wait until the 1970s.<ref name=ESF_F>Brian Stableford & Peter Nicholls, "Fantasy", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;410.</ref>

Clareson also suggests that ''Unknown'' influenced the science fiction that appeared in ''Astounding'' after ''Unknown'' folded.  According to this view, stories such as [[Clifford Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' series would not have appeared without the destruction of genre boundaries that Campbell oversaw. Clareson further proposes that ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of ''Unknown''.<ref name=SFFWFM_U/>

''Unknown'' is widely regarded as the finest fantasy magazine ever published:<ref name=EF_U/> Ashley says, for example, that "''Unknown'' published without doubt the greatest collection of fantasy stories produced in one magazine."<ref name=HSFM2_40>Ashley, ''History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 2'', p.&nbsp;40.</ref>  Despite its lack of commercial success, ''Unknown'' is the most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines; [[Lester del Rey]] describes it as having gained "a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match".<ref name=TWOSF_96>del Rey, ''World of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;96.</ref>  Edwards comments that ''Unknown'' "appeared during Campbell's peak years as an editor; its reputation may stand as high as it does partly because it died while still at its best".<ref name=ESF_U/>

Campbell and published by Street & Smith Publications throughout its run. It was pulp-sized from its launch through August 1941, and then [[bedsheet]]-sized from October 1941 to April 1943.  The last three issues were pulp-sized again.<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> Street & Smith had planned to switch it to [[digest size]] with the December 1943 issue, but it was cancelled before that issue appeared.<ref name=ESF_U>Malcolm Edwards, "Unknown", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', pp.&nbsp;1258<U+2013>1259.</ref> The price began at 20 cents and rose to 25 cents with the change to bedsheet size; it remained at 25 cents when the size changed back to pulp. It had 164 pages when pulp-sized and 130 pages while it was bedsheet-sized. It began as a monthly and switched to bimonthly from December 1940 on.<ref name=SFFWFM_U/> The volume numbering was regular, with six volumes of six numbers and a final volume of three numbers.<ref name=Tuck_U/>

The first six U.S. issues were available directly in the UK, but thereafter an abridged British reprint edition was issued by Atlas Publications, beginning in September 1939. It was pulp-sized, and priced at 9d (nine [[Coins_of_the_pound_sterling#Pre-decimal_coinage|pence]]) throughout. It appeared on a regular monthly schedule until December 1940, after which the schedule became quite irregular, with two or three issues appearing each year until 1949.  The volume numbering initially followed the corresponding U.S. editions, with some omitted numbers in 1942 and 1943, and then disappeared for four issues; from the twenty-eighth issue (Spring 1945) the magazine was numbered as if it had been given volumes of twelve numbers since the start of the run.  The title was changed from ''Unknown'' to ''Unknown Worlds'' with the March 1942 issue.<ref name=Tuck_U/><ref name=SFFWFM_U/>

In 1948, Street & Smith reprinted several stories from ''Unknown'' in a bedsheet-sized magazine format, priced at 25 cents, with the title ''From Unknown Worlds''.
