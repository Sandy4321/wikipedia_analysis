'''''Let Me In''''' is a 2010 [[Drama film|drama]]/[[horror film]] directed by [[Matt Reeves]]. It is based on the 2008 [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film]] ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'' (''L<U+00E5>t den r<U+00E4>tte komma in''), directed by [[Tomas Alfredson]], and the [[Let the Right One In|novel of the same name]] by [[John Ajvide Lindqvist]]. It tells the story of a [[School bullying|bullied]] 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a [[vampire]] child in a [[New Mexico]] [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|town]] in the early 1980s.

==Plot==
In 1983 in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a police detective ([[Elias Koteas]]) enters the hospital room of a disfigured man ([[Richard Jenkins]]) and tells him that he will catch whoever else is in league with him, but is then called out to take a phone call. While he is on the phone, a scream is heard, and the detective finds the suspect has fallen out of the window to his death. The man had scribbled a note: "I'm sory Abby ([[sic]])."

[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]] to two weeks earlier, Owen ([[Kodi Smit-McPhee]]) is a very unhappy and lonely 12-year-old child, who is neglected by his divorcing parents and continually harassed by cruel bullies. Owen harbors considerable anger against the school bullies; he often enacts imaginary fights where he stabs various targets representing the bullies. While peering at neighbors from his bedroom window with a telescope, he notices a girl ([[Chlo<U+00EB> Moretz]]) and a middle-aged man who appears to be her "father" move in next door.

One evening, when Owen is alone in the courtyard, practicing one of his imaginary fights, his actions are observed by the girl who starts the first conversation with Owen. Her name is revealed to be Abby, who claims to be 12 year old. Abby tells Owen that they cannot be friends, but regardless Abby and Owen grow closer, seeing each other at night and communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments. At school the main bully, Kenny ([[Dylan Minnette]]) scars Owen with an antenna rod; when Abby finds out about this she tells him to defend himself and she will help him if needed. 

Meanwhile, Abby's "father" goes out nightly to kill local residents to acquire blood for the vampiric Abby. During his first murder he accidentally spills the blood. A furious Abby feeds off of and kills a jogger who lives in the same neighborhood; the father dumps the body in a lake so that Abby is not incriminated. Abby continues developing her relationship with Owen and the father asks Abby to stop seeing Owen, but she does not.

One night, the father hides in a high school student<U+2019>s car, who ends up bringing a passenger. While the driver stops at a gas station, the father kills the passenger and gets in a car accident. Trapped, the father douses his face with acid so that his connection to Abby will not be discovered. The father is taken to the hospital; when Abby hears this on the news, she climbs up outside his window. Abby drinks his blood after the father silently implores her to do so, and he falls out to his death.

Abby goes to Owen's window while he is asleep and asks him if she can come in. Owen allows her into his room, and he asks her to be his girlfriend, which she begrudgingly accepts. The detective gradually learns of the protector's connection to Abby. The next day on a field trip for school, Owen stands up to Kenny and hits him with a pole, splitting his ear. That night, when Owen tells Abby, she approvingly kisses him on the cheek. He then takes her to an abandoned area of the complex where he cuts his finger to make a blood pact with her. Abby is drawn to the blood falling to the ground; she licks it up and Owen sees her vampiric face, but instead of attacking Owen, Abby runs away and attacks Virginia ([[Sasha Barrese]]), a woman in the complex park, but is chased off by her boyfriend, Larry (Dylan Kenin).

Owen becomes afraid and calls to his estranged father, who ends the phone call quickly. Owen then proceeds to Abby's apartment. She tells him she needs blood to live. As Owen looks through Abby's belongings, it becomes clear from old photos that the middle-aged man who protected her was not her father, but that many years ago, he was a boy she knew. Owen becomes frightened and leaves Abby's apartment. Abby visits one night when Owen's mother ([[Cara Buono]]) is away. Owen opens the door for her and she tells him he needs to invite her in. He asks why, so she enters without an invitation, which causes her to bleed heavily until he verbally acquiesces. Abby confidently tells Owen that she knew he would not let her die. Abby showers and Owen offers her one of his mother`s dresses, but she leaves when his mother returns.

At the hospital, the police officer learns from Larry that Abby attacked Virginia. A few seconds later a vampiric Virginia begins to feed on the blood in her arm from her IV. When a nurse opens the blinds to the daylight, she bursts into flames, setting fire to the nurse and the hospital room. The detective heads to Abby's apartment and breaks in. He finds Abby asleep in the bathroom and tries to shine the daylight to see her, partially burning Abby, but Owen distracts him. Abby kills the officer and leaves that night after her identity is discovered. A taxi takes Abby to her new destination, as Owen watches from the window and cries.
 
During gym class, Kenny, his older brother Jimmy, and friends start a fire outside to distract the teacher ([[Ritchie Coster]]) and clear out the swimming pool. Jimmy tells Owen that if he can survive underwater for three minutes, then he will cut Owen's cheek; if he cannot he will poke an eye out. Owen is held underwater by Jimmy and struggles to hold his breath, but is saved by Abby who has returned to help him as she promised.

Sometime later, Owen is on a train with a large chest, revealed to contain Abby. Abby taps out "kiss" in Morse code and Owen taps back.

==Production==

Writer Ajvide Lindqvist, on the other hand, says that Reeves told him that he "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" and so "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see."<ref name="JAL">[[Ain't It Cool News]].

Reeves has expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting and terrifying film. I'm really excited about what it could be", he said.<ref name="mtv_remake">{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/11/14/exclusive-cloverfield-director-matt-reeves-reveals-let-the-right-one-in-remake-details/|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Cloverfield' Director Matt Reeves Reveals 'Let The Right One In' Remake Details|last=Horowitz|first=Josh|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=[[MTV]] Movies Blog|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> In response to the criticism he said, "I can understand because of people's love of the [original] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film.

Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely...we need that childlike innocence."  He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story."<ref name="Harley"/> The filmmakers have noted that "they intend to forge a unique identity for ''Let Me In'', placing it firmly in an American context", while at the same time paying respect to the original.<ref name="dread"/> Producer [[Donna Gigliotti]] said, "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million.

===Critical response===
{{Anchors|Critics}}
''Let Me In'' has received generally positive reviews. Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 176 reviews (with an average score of 7.6/10) and that 81% of the top critics have given the film a positive review based on 31 reviews (with an average score of 7.8/10). The consensus is that "similar to the original [''Let the Right One In''] in all the right ways {{ndash}} but with enough changes to stand on its own {{ndash}} ''Let Me In'' is the rare Hollywood remake that doesn't add insult to inspiration."<ref name="tomatoes">{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/let_me_in/ |title= Let Me In Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> 
[[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 79% based on 35 reviews, judged to be "generally favorable reviews". Critics praised the faithfulness in Reeves' adaptation of the original Swedish film and the novel, but also noted that enough changes were made to make the interpretation of the story stand on its own merits. Praise was also given to the film's two leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, in regard to their chemistry and maturity on-screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/let-me-in |title=Let Me In |publisher= [[CBS]] | work = [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref> However some critics disputed Reeves' claims that he was not remaking the film but readapting the book. Josh Tyler wrote that

{{quote|The movie he<U+2019>s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it<U+2019>s almost impossible to differentiate between them. Reeves<U+2019> take is masterfully well done, but it<U+2019>s not because he<U+2019>s put his own stamp on it. ''Let Me In'' is good because ''Let the Right One In'' is good, and Reeves simply made the same film, only slightly better. They<U+2019>re nearly identical, right down to their bones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Let-Me-In-4871.html|title=Let Me In - Review}}</ref>}}

In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich wrote

{{quote|Rumors had previously suggested that ''Let Me In'' would start over with Lindqvist's lengthy novel and tease an entirely different story out of it. I've read the book, and there was certainly plenty left behind when Lindqvist wrote his screenplay. Unfortunately, Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in ''Let Me In'' than in the Alfredson version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46029/let-me-in|title=Let Me In: DVD Talk Review}}</ref>}}

Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote 

{{quote|"Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years. Whether you're a teenager or a film-lover in your 50s, you'll be knocked out. Rush to it now. You can thank me later."<ref>http://www.awardsdaily.com/2010/10/stephen-king-let-me-in-the-best-american-horror-film-in-the-last-20-years/</ref>}}

In comparing ''Let Me In'' with ''Let the Right One In'', [[Bloody Disgusting]] wrote,

{{quote|"Ultimately, if the Swedish version is near perfection, Matt Reeves's version achieves complete supremacy. Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's hard to think of another so powerful. Let Me In is the new standard for vampire movies.<ref>http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/film/2230/review</ref>}}

Beth Accomando wrote, 

{{quote|"How [Reeves] can take the credit <U+201C>written and directed by Matt Reeves<U+201D> seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original. A <U+201C>lifted by<U+201D> or <U+201C>facsimile by<U+201D> might be more accurate...I simply cannot admire what Reeves does with the remake. The best I can do is commend his skill at imitating the original."  In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity. In the new film the pre-teen romance is more obvious, the fact that the girl is not human is signaled from the start, and the violence is more blatant."<ref>www.kpbs.org/news/2010/oct/01/review-let-me/</ref>}}

===Author's response===
John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of ''Let The Right One In'', who also wrote the screenplay for the original Swedish film, was pleased with ''Let Me In''. He said

{{quote|I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. ''Let The Right One In'' is a great Swedish movie. ''Let Me In'' is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But ''Let Me In'' puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. ''Let Me In'' is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful.
