The history of [[FC Barcelona|Futbol Club Barcelona]] goes from the [[football club]]'s founding in 1899 and up to current time. FC Barcelona, also known simply as "Barcelona" and familiarly as "Bar<U+00E7>a", is based in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[England|English]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] footballers led by [[Joan Gamper]]. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed ten [[UEFA]] trophies and a [[sextuple]]. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2010, Barcelona has never been relegated from [[La Liga]], a record they share with [[Athletic Bilbao]] and arch-rival [[Real Madrid]].

The history of Barcelona has often been political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with [[Catalan people|Catalan]] values. In Spain's transition to [[autocracy]] in 1925, [[Catalonia]] became increasingly hostile towards the central government in [[Madrid]]. The hostility enhanced FC Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of FC Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s<U+2013>a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players<U+2013>club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.

On 22 October 1899, [[Joan Gamper]] placed an advertisement in ''Los Deportes'' declaring his wish to form a football club. A positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol<U+00E9> on 29 November. Eleven players attended: [[Walter Wild]], later to become the first director of the club, Llu<U+00ED>s d'Oss<U+00F3>, [[Bartomeu Terradas]], Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons. As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born.<ref name="Ball, Phil p. 89">Ball, Phil p. 89</ref> The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, [[FC Basel]].<ref>Ball, Phil pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref>

FC Barcelona quickly emerged as one of the leading clubs in Spain, competing in the [[Catalan football championship|Campeonato de Catalu<U+00F1>a]] and the [[Copa del Rey]]. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the [[Catalan football championship|Copa Macaya]], and also played in the first Copa del Rey final, losing 2<U+2013>1 to [[Athletic Bilbao|Bizcaya]].<ref name="rsssf1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancuphist.html |title=Spain <U+2013> List of Cup Finals |author=Carnicero, Jos<U+00E9> Vicente Tejedor|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref>

In 1908, [[Joan Gamper]] became club president for the first time to save the club from bankruptcy. The club had not won since the [[Catalan football championship|Campeonato de Catalu<U+00F1>a]] in 1905; this caused their financial trouble. One of his main achievements was to help Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income.<ref name="fcbarcelona1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_1.html |title=History part I|publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 Marts 2010}}</ref>

On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the [[Camp de la Ind<U+00FA>stria]], a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, a logo contest was held the following year. [[Carles Comamala]] won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor changes.<ref name=crest>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html|title=The crest|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=FC Barcelona}}</ref>

With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the [[Pyrenees Cup]], which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of [[Languedoc]], [[Midi]] and [[Aquitaine]] (Southern France), the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and Catalonia; all were former members of the [[Marca Hispanica]] region. The contest was generally considered the most prestigious in that era.<ref>Murray, Bill; Murray, William J. p. 30</ref> From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and [[Jack Greenwell]]. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.<ref>Closa ''et al.'' p. 62<U+2013>63</ref> The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals [[Espanyol]] won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/pyrenees.html |title=Coupe des Pyren<U+00E9>es <U+2013> Copa de los Pirineos |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=19 June 2001|accessdate=12 June 2010|author= Ferrer , Carles Lozano}}</ref>

During the same period, the club changed its official language from [[Spanish language|Castilian]] to [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.<ref>Spaaij, Ram<U+00F3>n. p. 279</ref> On 4 February 1917, the club held its first [[testimonial match]] to honour [[Ram<U+00F3>n Torralba]] who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6<U+2013>2.<ref name="fcbarcelona.cat">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/centre_de_documentacio/annexes/castellano/24_._PARTIDOS_DE_HOMENAJE_A_JUGADORES.pdf |title=Partidos de homenaje a jugadores |format=PDF |language=Catalan |publisher=Center for Documentation, FC Barcelona |accessdate=24 August 2010 }}</ref>

Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club-members, and, by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Cortes]], which they inaugurated the same year.<ref name=Arnaud103/> Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 22,000, and was later expanded to 60,000.<ref name="fcbarcelona2">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_2.html |title=History part II |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>

Gamper recruited [[Jack Greenwell]] as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After he was hired, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven [[Catalan football championship|Campeonato de Catalu<U+00F1>a]], six [[Copa del Rey]] and four [[Pyrenees Cup]]s and enjoyed its first "golden age".<ref name="rsssf1"/><ref name="fcbarcelona1"/>

==Rivera, Republic and Civil War (1923<U+2013>1957) ==
[[File:Alberti002 flipped.jpg|thumb|right|The Catalan poet [[Rafael Alberti]], wrote a poem hailing the Barcelona goalkeeper [[Franz Platko]].]]On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against [[Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the [[Royal March]]. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.<ref>Shubert, Adrian. p. 200</ref> This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.<ref name=Arnaud103>Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 103</ref> On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for [[Paulino Alc<U+00E1>ntara]], against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane.<ref name="fcbarcelona.cat"/> In 1928, victory in the [[Spanish Cup]] was celebrated with a poem titled "Oda a [[Franz Platko|Platko]]", which was written by a member of the [[Generation of '27]], [[Rafael Alberti]], inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona [[goalkeeper]], Franz Platko.<ref>{{cite web|title=Football, European Integration, National Identity: The Case of FC Barcelona|author=Roy, Joaqu<U+00ED>n|date=2001|publisher=European Community Studies Association (paper)|page=4}}</ref> Two years after the victory, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.<ref name="fcbarcelona1"/>

Although they continued to have players of the standing of [[Josep Escol<U+00E0>]], the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.<ref>Burns, Jimmy. pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref> Although the team won the [[Catalan football championship|Campionat de Catalunya]] in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938,<ref name="rsssf1"/> success at a national level (with the exception of the [[Mediterranean League|1937 disputed title]]) evaded them.

A month after the [[Spanish Civil War]] began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.<ref>Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 104</ref> On 6 August, [[Falangist]] soldiers near [[Guadarrama]] murdered club president [[Josep Sunyol]], a representative of the pro-independence political party.<ref>Spaaij, Ram<U+00F3>n. pp. 280</ref> He was dubbed the martyr of ''barcelonisme'', and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.<ref>Ball, Phil. pp. 116<U+2013>117</ref> In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.<ref>Murray, Bill; Murray, William. p. 70</ref><ref>Ball, Phil. pp. 118<U+2013>120</ref>

[[File:Barcelona bombing.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The aerial bombardment of Barcelona seen from one of the bombers]]
On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the [[Italian Air Force]], causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.<ref>Raguer, Hilari. pp. 223<U+2013>225</ref><ref>Graham, Helen. p. 351</ref> A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the "undisciplined" [[Catalanism]], the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan [[Senyera|flag]] was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to ''Club de F<U+00FA>tbol Barcelona'' and to remove the [[Catalan flag]] from its crest.<ref>Burns, Jimmy. pp. 80<U+2013>83</ref>

In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of [[Copa del General<U+00ED>simo]]. The first match at [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Corts]] was won by Barcelona 3<U+2013>0. Before the second leg, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s director of state security visited Barcelona's players in the changing room. He reminded them that they were only playing due to the "generosity of the [[Franco regime|regime]]". Real Madrid comfortably won the match, beating Barcelona 11<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=70557.html|title=Barca<U+2014>Much more than just a Club|date=10 December 1998|accessdate=10 May 2009|publisher=[[FIFA]]|last=Aguilar|first=Paco}}</ref>

Despite the difficult political situation, ''CF Barcelona'' enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with [[Josep Samitier]] as coach and players like [[C<U+00E9>sar Rodr<U+00ED>guez Alvarez|C<U+00E9>sar]], [[Antoni Ramallets|Ramallets]] and [[Juan Zambudio Velasco|Velasco]], they won La Liga for the first time since 1929.

On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2<U+2013>1 win against [[Racing Santander|Santander]] by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the [[Francoist]] authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in [[Barcelona]], receiving the support of [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|blaugrana fans]]. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just [[Catalonia]] and many progressive [[Spaniards]] saw the club as a staunch defender of [[rights]] and [[freedoms]].<ref>Ferrand, Alain; McCarthy, Scott. p. 90</ref><ref>Witzig, Richard. p. 408</ref>

Coach [[Fernando Daucik]] and [[Ladislao Kubala]], regarded by many as the club's best player, inspired the team to several different trophies in 1952, including La Liga, the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del General<U+00ED>simo]], the [[Copa Latina]], the [[Supercopa de Espa<U+00F1>a|Copa Eva Duarte]] and the Copa Martini Rossi. In 1953, they helped the club win La Liga and the Copa del General<U+00ED>simo again.<ref name="fcbarcelona2"/>

With [[Helenio Herrera]] as coach, a young [[Luis Su<U+00E1>rez Miramontes|Luis Su<U+00E1>rez]], the [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1960, and two influential [[Hungary|Hungarians]] recommended by Kubala, [[S<U+00E1>ndor Kocsis]] and [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Czibor]], the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a [[European Cup 1960<U+2013>61|European Cup]] play-off. However, they lost 2<U+2013>3 to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/ec1.html |title=European Champions' Cup |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]](RSSSF) |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=Karel |last=Stokkermans}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html |title=European Competitions 1960<U+2013>61 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=James M. |last=Ross}}</ref><ref name="fcbarcelona3">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_3.html |title=History part III |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref>

The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the ''[[Camp Nou]]'', finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.<ref name="fcbarcelona3"/> The 1960s saw the emergence of [[Josep Fust<U+00E9>]] and [[Carles Rexach]], and the club won the Copa del General<U+00ED>simo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1<U+2013>0 in the 1968 Copa del General<U+00ED>simo final at the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u Stadium|Bernab<U+00E9>u]] in front of Franco, with coach [[Salvador Artigas]], a former [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] pilot in the civil war. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to ''Futbol Club Barcelona'' and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |title=The Crest |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eufo.de/football/esp/fc_blona.html|title=FC Barcelona<U+2014>European football clubs &amp; squads|accessdate=12 July 2008|publisher=Eufo.de}}</ref>

The 1973<U+2013>74 season saw the arrival of a new Barcelona player [[Johan Cruyff]], who was bought for a world record <U+00A3>920,000 from [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]].<ref>MacWilliam, Rab; MacDonald, Tom. p. 180</ref> Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with [[Francisco Franco]]. He further endeared himself when he named his son [[Jordi Cruyff|''Jordi'']], after the local Catalan [[Saint George]].<ref>Ball, Phil. pp. 83<U+2013>85</ref> Next to champions like [[Juan Manuel Asensi]], [[Carles Rexach]] and [[Hugo Sotil]], he helped the club win the [[La Liga 1973<U+2013>74|1973<U+2013>74 season]] for the first time since 1960,<ref name="rsssf1"/> defeating Real Madrid 5<U+2013>0 at the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u Stadium|Bernab<U+00E9>u]] along the way. He was crowned [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/europa-poy.html|date=11 December 2009|author=Moore, Rob; Stokkermans, Karel |title=European Footballer of the Year ("Ballon d'Or") |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref>

In 1978, [[Josep Llu<U+00ED>s N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez]] became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of players as Maradona, Romario and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.<ref name="fcbarcelona4">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010}}</ref><ref>Ball, Phil p. 85</ref>

On 16 May 1979, the club won its first [[Cup Winners Cup]] by beating [[Fortuna D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] 4<U+2013>3 in [[Basel]] in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez began to invest in the club's youth program by converting [[La Masia]] to a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth program of Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/la_Masia/lamasia.html|title=La Masia|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=[[FC Barcelona]]}}</ref>

In June 1982, [[Diego Maradona]] was signed for a world record fee of <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million from [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]].<ref>Dobson, Stephen; Goddard, John A. p. 180</ref> In the following season, under coach [[C<U+00E9>sar Luis Menotti|Luis]], Barcelona won the [[Copa del Rey]], beating Real Madrid. However, Maradona's time with Barcelona was short-lived and he soon left for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. At the start of the [[La Liga 1984-85|1984<U+2013>85]] season, [[Terry Venables]] was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder [[Bernd Schuster]]. The next season, he took the team to their second [[European Cup 1985<U+2013>86|European Cup]] final, only to lose on penalties to [[FC Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti|Steaua Bucure<U+015F>ti]] during a dramatic evening in Seville.<ref name="fcbarcelona4"/>

Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, [[Boixos Nois]]. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in [[skinheads]], who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez's presidency.<ref>Spaaij, Ram<U+00F3>n p. 291-292</ref> Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.<ref>Spaaij, Ram<U+00F3>n p. 293</ref>

After the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], Barcelona signed the English top-scorer [[Gary Lineker]], along with goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987<U+2013>88 season and replaced with [[Luis Aragon<U+00E9>s]]. The season finished with the players rebelling against president N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1<U+2013>0 victory at the [[Copa del Rey]] final against [[Real Sociedad]].<ref name="fcbarcelona4"/>

It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was current Barcelona coach [[Josep Guardiola]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article5950195.ece |author=Hawkey, Ian |publisher=The Times |accessdate=30 July 2010|title=Novelty factor adds spice to clash of giants|date=22 March 2009 | location=London}}</ref>
Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in both the 1989 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1988<U+2013>89|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] final and the 1992 [[European Cup 1991<U+2013>92|European Cup]] final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], with a free kick goal from Dutch international [[Ronald Koeman]]. They also won a [[Copa del Rey]] in 1990, the [[European Super Cup]] in 1992 and three [[Supercopa de Espa<U+00F1>a]]. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager to date. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.<ref name=honours>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/palmares/palmares.html|title=Honours |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president [[Josep Llu<U+00ED>s N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez|N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez]], resulting in his departure.<ref name="fcbarcelona4"/>

Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by [[Armand Caraben]], [[Joan Laporta]] and [[Alfons Godall]]. The objective of the group, called ''L'Elefant Blau'', was to oppose the presidency of N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.<ref>King, Anthony pp. 185<U+2013>186</ref><ref>Ball, Phil pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref> Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.

Cruyff was briefly replaced by [[Bobby Robson]], who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996<U+2013>97. He recruited [[Ronaldo]] from his previous club, [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and delivered a [[Treble (association football)|cup treble]], winning the [[Copa del Rey]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1995<U+2013>96|UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] and the [[Supercopa de Espa<U+00F1>a]]. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution, while the club waited for [[Louis van Gaal]] to become available.<ref name="fcbarcelona5">{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_5.html |title=History part V |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref>

Like Maradona, [[Ronaldo]] only stayed a short time before he left for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]]. However, new heroes emerged, such as [[Lu<U+00ED>s Figo]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Luis Enrique Mart<U+00ED>nez Garc<U+00ED>a|Luis Enrique]] and [[Rivaldo]], and the team won a [[Copa del Rey]] and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its 'centenari', winning the Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n title, and [[Rivaldo]] became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded [[European Footballer of the Year]]. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez resigning in 2000.<ref name="fcbarcelona5"/>

== The Laporta years (2000<U+2013>2010) ==

The departures of N<U+00FA><U+00F1>ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of [[Lu<U+00ED>s Figo]], then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the ''[[Camp Nou]]'', Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.<ref>Ball, Phil. p. 19</ref> The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went, including a short second spell by Louis van Gaal. President [[Joan Gaspart|Gaspart]] did not inspire confidence off the field either, and in 2003, he and van Gaal resigned.<ref>Ball, Phil. pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref>

After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, [[Joan Laporta]], and a young new manager, former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] star [[Frank Rijkaard]], saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including [[Ronaldinho]], [[Deco]], [[Henrik Larsson]], [[Ludovic Giuly]], [[Samuel Eto'o]], and [[Rafael M<U+00E1>rquez]], combined with home grown Spanish players, such as [[Carles Puyol]], [[Andr<U+00E9>s Iniesta]], [[Xavi]] and [[V<U+00ED>ctor Vald<U+00E9>s]], led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the [[Supercopa de Espa<U+00F1>a]] in 2004<U+2013>05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4486166.stm |title=Ronaldinho wins world award again |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref>

In the 2005<U+2013>06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercup successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u Stadium]] in a 3<U+2013>0 win over Real Madrid. It was Frank Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernab<U+00E9>u, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/real-madrid-0-barcelona-3-bernabeu-forced-to-pay-homage-as-ronaldinho-soars-above-the-galacticos-516202.html|title=Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 3: Bernabeu forced to pay homage as Ronaldinho soars above the galacticos |publisher=The Independent|date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=McCurdy}}</ref> In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2<U+2013>1 in the final. Trailing 1<U+2013>0 to a 10-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2<U+2013>1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for [[Samuel Eto'o]] and fellow substitute [[Juliano Belletti]], for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |title=Barcelona 2<U+2013>1 Arsenal |publisher=BBC News |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref>

Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006<U+2013>07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star [[Lionel Messi]]. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6353861.stm |title=Barcelona will not punish Eto'o |publisher=BBC News|date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref> Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerway.com/news/2007/August/03/barcelona-defends-asian-tour/ |title=Barcelona defends Asian tour |publisher=soccerway.com|work=AFP |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the [[Copa del Rey]], winning the first leg against [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] 5<U+2013>2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to [[Diego Maradona]]'s goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4<U+2013>0.

Barcelona finished the [[2007<U+2013>08 FC Barcelona season|2007<U+2013>08 season]] third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League 2007<U+2013>08|UEFA Champions League]] and [[Copa del Rey 2007<U+2013>08|Copa del Rey]], both times losing to the eventual champions, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], respectively. The day after a 4<U+2013>1 defeat to Real Madrid, [[Joan Laporta]] announced that [[FC Barcelona Atl<U+00E8>tic|Barcelona B]] coach [[Josep Guardiola]] would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/destacades/n080508104104.html|title=Rijkaard until 30 June; Guardiola to take over|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|publisher=FC Barcelona}}</ref>

In the pre-season of [[La Liga 2008<U+2013>09|2008<U+2013>09]], a motion of no confidence was raised against club president [[Joan Laporta]]. This motion received 60&nbsp;percent support, just short of the 66&nbsp;percent required to oust him, prompting eight of the directors to resign.
