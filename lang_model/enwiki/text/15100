'''Buckley''' is a [[suburb]]an area within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzb.htm |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=11 July 2010|at=Places names - B}}</ref> It lies at the northern fringe of [[Rochdale]], along the course of Buckley Brook, "upon an eminence of ground" by the [[South Pennines]].<ref name="County of Lanc">{{Harvnb|Brownbill|Farrer|1911|p=225-227.}}</ref> It is {{convert|1.2|mi|km|1}} south-southwest of the village of [[Wardle, Greater Manchester|Wardle]] and {{convert|1.3|mi|km|1}} north-northeast of Rochdale's town centre. Buckley spans a watercourse, a prison, farmland and residential properties.

Buckley emerged as a constituent settlement of the manor of [[Hundersfield]] following the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]]. Although the name Buckley is of [[Old English]] derivation, the settlement's medieval history is tied closely to a [[Normans|Norman]] family who were granted the estate as a gift for their services given in the [[Norman conquest of England]], and subsequently adopted the surname '[[Buckley (surname)|de Buckley]]'. Members of the Buckleys of Buckley family appear throughout the High Middle Ages in legal charters related to Buckley, the surrounding area, and its manor house [[Buckley Hall]].

Throughout the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period, Buckley was the principal estate of the [[Wardleworth|township of Wardleworth]]. The Buckleys of Buckley Hall continued to hold positions of regional importance, such as preists, gentry and military officers, but their size and influence diminished through death and migration prompting the obsolescence of the Buckley estate. The outwards expansion of the neighbouring town of Rochdale caused Buckley to be industrialised and then suburbanised.

Although continuously occupied and revamped during the 18th and 19th centuries, Buckley Hall became unoccupied in the 1880s. The [[Brothers of Charity]], an institute of the [[Catholic Church]], successfully agitated for the purchase  of Buckley Hall and its conversion into an [[orphanage]] for Catholic boys. The orphanage was operational from 1888 until 1947. The original building was demolished in the early-1990s and [[Buckley Hall (HM Prison)|HM Prison Buckley Hall]] was opened in its place. 

==History==
Buckley emerged as a settlement following the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The name Buckley is derived from the [[Old English]] term ''<U+00E6>bl<U+00E6>c hl<U+00E6>w'', which translates as "bleak hill".<ref name="March17">{{Harvnb|March|1916|p=17}}.</ref><ref name="Gallacher1"/> This Old English term became corrupted to "Blakelow",<ref name="March17"/> and then into the varients of "Bucklegh", "Bulkey", "Bukklegh", and "Bucley" before settling on "Buckley".<ref name="Gallacher1">{{Harvnb|Gallacher|2003|p=1}}.</ref>

The medieval [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Buckley lay within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] manor of [[Hundersfield]], in the [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|parish of Rochdale]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Fishwick|1889|p=390}}.</ref> It remained in obscurity until the 11th century, when it is believed that [[Normans]] loyal to [[William I of England|William I, King of England]] were gifted the estate as a reward for their services given during the [[Norman conquest of England]].<ref name="Gallacher1"/> It is from this exchange that the "ancient" and "local" family of Buckley<U+2014>the progentitors of the [[Buckley (surname)|Buckley surname]] in [[North West England]]<U+2014>was founded.<ref name="County of Lanc"/> "Geoffrey de Buckley" is the oldest known member of the Buckley family, who appeared during the 12th century in charters relating to [[Stanlow Abbey]], [[Whalley Abbey]] and land exchange in and around the hamlet of Buckley.<ref name="County of Lanc"/> Although Buckley is a term of Old English derivation, the given name [[Geoffrey (given name)|Geoffrey]] is of [[Old French]] origin, and the use of the [[nobiliary particle]] 'de' indicates the Norman origins of the Buckley family.<ref name="Gallacher1"/><ref name="Flan7">{{Harvnb|Flanagan|Hughes|1988|p=7}}.</ref> Geoffrey de Buckley served as the [[Dean of Whalley]], and his nephew, also called Geoffrey de Buckley, was killed at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265 and is commemorated in windows at [[Worcester Cathedral]] and [[Lichfield Cathedral]].<ref name="Gallacher1"/>
[[File:Map of Buckley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Buckley, as mapped by the [[Ordnance Survey]] between 1888 and 1947.]]
At the centre of the Buckley estate was a [[watermill]] used for grinding grain, which existed at least as early as 1335, and [[Buckley Hall]], which first appears in written records in a description dated 1626.<ref name="Gallacher1"/> Buckley Hall was noted as a "faire mansion house",<ref name="Gallacher1"/> and was owned by a family or families surnamed Buckley, after the locality.<ref name="County of Lanc"/> The Buckleys of Buckley used Buckley Hall as a [[chapel]] and residence and continued to have influence over local and regional affairs as [[preist]]s, [[yeomen]], [[esquire]]s and other [[gentry]] into the [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern Period]]; Geoffrey Buckley of Buckley was the Rector of [[St Alban, Wood Street|St Alban's Church in London]] during the 1470s,<ref>{{harvnb|Mattley|1899|p=2}}.</ref> and John Buckley of Buckley, son of Abel, was a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] with the [[Roundhead]]s at the [[Siege of Lathom House]] during the [[English Civil War]].<ref name=Fish393>{{Harvnb|Fishwick|1889|p=393}}.</ref>  When the manor of Hundersfield was abolished and its territory subdivided amongst new [[Township (England)|townships]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Fishwick|1889|p=1}}.</ref> Buckley Hall and its surrounding area fell within the bounds of [[Wardleworth]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> Buckley appears to have been the "principal estate" of Wardleworth and encompassed land in the outlying areas of Foxholes and Fieldhouse.<ref name="County of Lanc"/> The main line of the Buckley family continued to own Buckley Hall and its estates,<ref name="Gallacher2">{{Harvnb|Gallacher|2003|p=2}}.</ref> while other members founded new families in [[Saddleworth]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Fishwick|1889|p=394}}.</ref> and [[Shaw and Crompton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rathbone|2000|p=152}}.</ref>  The lineal descendants of the Buckleys of Buckley gradually diminished in number and influence through death and migration;{{fact|reason=details appear in William Robertson's Social and Political History of Rochdale}} the last member of the main branch of the Buckleys of Buckley was a Captain William Buckley.<ref name="Gallacher2"/> In 1722, Captain Buckley had a lethal dispute with Major Samuel Crooke, the [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]], regarding a [[Rights of way in England and Wales|right of way]] in [[Higher Walton, Lancashire]]. Buckley and Cooke entered a duel at Rochdale in which Cooke was killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Mattley|1899|p=6}}.</ref> Buckley was tried at the [[Assizes (England and Wales)|assizes]] in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and found guilty of manslaughter, but received "only a light sentence".{{fact|reason=details appear in William Robertson's Social and Political History of Rochdale}} He died in 1730.<ref name="Gallacher2"/>

The demise of the Buckleys of Buckley, combined with the urbanisation of the expanding [[market town]] of [[Rochdale]], brought about the gradual obsolescence of the Buckley estate. Buckley Hall passed from Captain William Buckley to his nephew Thomas Foster (who assumed the surname of Buckley), and his son, Edward Buckley, who in 1786 sold the hall and estate to Robert Entwisle.<ref name=Fish393/> The [[industrialisation]] of Rochdale resulted in its outwards expansion into neighbouring townships; in 1825 part of Wardleworth was included in the area of the commissioners for the improvement of the town of Rochdale,<ref name="GM Gazetteer2"/> and an act of parliament in 1839 allowed Rochdale's Water Works Company to construct a reservoir in Buckley to supply water to Rochdale.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1956|p=89}}.</ref> Buckley Wood Reservior was completed in December 1841 and held {{convert|24271312|impgal|lk=on}} of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Mattley|1899|p=16}}.</ref> By 1851 Rochdale had expanded well into the bounds of Wardleworth,<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|1851|p=446}}.</ref> and in 1872 the remaining area of Wardleworth was subsumed into the [[County Borough of Rochdale|Municipal Borough of Rochdale]],<ref name="GM Gazetteer2"/> effectively abolishing Wardleworth and bringing Buckley entirely into the bounds of Rochdale proper.
[[File:Buckley Mill, Rochdale.jpg|thumb|left|Buckley Mill, seen here in 1968, was part of a Victorian-era factory complex in Buckley.]]
Although the Buckley family was said to be one of the founders of the cotton trade in the area,<ref name="Gallacher2"/> industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Buckley with the construction of Buckley Mills. Buckly became "a Victorian ensemble of a mill, workers' housing" and Buckley Hall as "the mill owners house", which in 1860 fell to the Schofields, a family of merchants and traders.<ref name="Gallacher2"/> Buckley Mills were visited by [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 6th Duke of Newcastle]] in September 1873.<ref>{{harvnb|Mattley|1899|p=61}}.</ref> Buckley Hall was demolished in the 1860s by the Schofields and rebuilt "to the highest standards of comfort and opulence for the time ... four storeys high of red brick with yellow brick arches in an Italianate style with an Elizabethan bow".<ref name="Gallacher2"/> However, in 1882 Buckley Hall became unoccupied as a result of William Schofield's death, and stayed unoccupied until brought to the attention of [[Herbert Vaughan]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford]] in 1887.<ref name="Gallacher3">{{Harvnb|Gallacher|2003|pp=3-4}}.</ref> Buckley Hall was found to be suitable for conversion into an orphanage and Poor Law School operated by the [[Brothers of Charity]], a Catholic institute from [[Ghent]] in Belgium.<ref name="Gallacher3"/> Buckley Hall Orphanage officially opened on 19 March 1888 with 28 Catholic boys in residence.<ref name="Gallacher3"/> Construction of Eclipse Mill at Buckley began in 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Mattley|1899|p=126}}.</ref>

==Governance==
In the Early Middle Ages, Buckley was governed as a part of the Anglo-Saxon manor of [[Hundersfield]] in the [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|Rochdale ecclesiastical parish]] and [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]]. Following the [[Norman conquest of England]], Buckley fell into [[Normans|Norman]] ownership, and was governed as a private estate consisting of "[[messuage]] and lands" held by the 'de Buckley' family.<ref name=Fish391>{{Harvnb|Fishwick|1889|pp=391-392}}.</ref> In 1576, Buckley was described as a "[[manor]]", still held by the Buckleys of Buckley, albeit under the overlordship of [[Sir John Byron, Jr.]].<ref name=Fish391/> When Hundersfield was subdivided into [[Township (England)|townships]], Buckley became part of [[Wardleworth|Wardleworth township]] in the [[Historic counties of England|county]] of [[Lancashire]];<ref name="GM Gazetteer2">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzt2w.htm#wardleworth |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=11 July 2010|at=Places names - T to W}}</ref> east of watercourse of Buckley Brook was Wardleworth's boundary with [[Wuerdle and Wardle]]. 

In 1825, well after the demise of the Buckleys of Buckley, part of Wardleworth was included in the area of the [[police commissioner]]s who were tasked with the improvement of the encroaching [[market town]] of [[Rochdale]]. In 1872 the remaining area of Wardleworth became part of the [[County Borough of Rochdale|Municipal Borough of Rochdale]];<ref name="GM Gazetteer2"/> Buckley became Rochdale's northeastern boundary with the [[Wardle Urban District]] in 1894. Local governance continued on this basis until after the [[Local Government Act 1972]], when in 1974, the then County Borough of Rochdale was abolished and replaced by the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], a local government district of [[Greater Manchester]].
