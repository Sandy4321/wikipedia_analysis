'''Health issues in American football''' comprise a number of health risks associated with participating in the [[sport]]. Injuries are relatively common in [[American football]], due to its nature as a [[Contact sport#Full-contact|full-contact]] game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include [[strain (injury)|strains]], [[sprain]]s, [[bone fracture|fractures]], [[joint dislocation|dislocations]], and [[concussion]]s. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like [[dementia]] and [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). In individual leagues like the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.

[[Catastrophic injury|Catastrophic injuries]]<U+2014>defined as serious injury to the [[Vertebral column|spine]], [[spinal cord]], or [[brain]]<U+2014>and fatalities are uncommon in football; both have become less and less common since the 1970s, although a small number of both still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by [[helmet-to-helmet collision]]s as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the downturn in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of players at the NFL level reported major injuries and shortened careers from the 1970s onwards, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of [[artificial turf]].

In many cases, injuries sustained while playing can cause long-term damage. In addition to neurological damage caused by hits to the head, injuries to the mid and lower body can force players to retire or lead to nagging ailments in later life.  Various methods have been used to reduce injuries in football, including rule changes such as the abolition of large wedge formations; a sharp decline in [[cervical spine injury|cervical spine injuries]] since the 1970s has been attributed to rule changes that altered blocking and tackling techniques. More recently, rule changes to protect players from head injuries have been instituted. Equipment like the [[football helmet]] and pads are used to give players a level of protection from injuries, while other factors such as [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]] size are used to minimize the risk of injuries due to field condition.

Because American football is a full-contact sport, injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at [[Seton Medical Center]] in [[Daly City, California]], up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, and there are an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.<ref name="Sports Medicine" />

An injury report section is common in the sports sections of American [[newspaper]]s, detailing injuries for each team and the amount of time each injured player is expected to be out. The injury report was created to prevent [[sports betting|gamblers]] from gaining inside information about injuries from players, and as a result, NFL teams must report on the status of injured players on a set schedule during the season. The standard severity descriptions are "out" (will not play in the upcoming game); "doubtful" (25% chance of playing); "questionable" (50% chance of playing); or "probable" (75% chance of playing).

In 1994, the NFL established the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later replaced by the Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Dr. Ira Casson and Dr. Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating that there is not enough research to determine if [[concussion]]s lead to permanent [[brain injury]].<ref name=Fainaru13>{{cite news |title=New questions about NFL doctor |author1=Steve Fainaru |author2=John Barr |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9561661/central-figure-nfl-concussion-crisis-appointed-years-ago-league-position-commissioner-paul-tagliabue-patient|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=nyt>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/sports/football/05concussions.html?_r=0|title=Congress Examines N.F.L.

NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] addressed the issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]]. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the [[National Institutes of Health]] to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues.<ref name = nyt2>{{cite news|title=Roger Goodell, N.F.L.

Concussions are also an issue outside of professional football. In a 2010 study by [[Purdue University]] and [[Indiana University]], an estimated 43,000 to 67,000 football players suffer a concussion every season. However, because many injuries go unreported, the true number may exceed 100,000. The study, "{{sic|hide=y|Functionally|-}}Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion", was published in 2013 in the ''Journal of Neurotrauma'' and observed 21 high school players throughout a season;  it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/high-school-football-concussions/ |title=Brain Injury Risks for High School Football Players |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Talavage |first=Thomas |author2=Eric A.

[[Catastrophic injury|Catastrophic injuries]] are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all high school sports in the United States from 1982 to 2011.<ref name="Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Corbett|title=Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20131109-not-all-student-athletes-covered-for-catastrophic-injuries.ece|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=November 28, 2013|date=November 9, 2013}}</ref> In football, catastrophic injuries are rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since the introduction of the modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher at the high school level than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries<U+2014>8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.<ref name="Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and College Football Players">{{cite journal|title=Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and College Football Players|last1=Boden|first1=Barry P.|last2=Tacchetti|first2=Robin L.|last3=Cantu|first3=Robert C.|last4=Knowles|first4=Sarah B.|last5=Mueller|first5=Frederick O.|journal=[[American Journal of Sports Medicine]]|date=July 2007|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1,075-1,081|url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/content/35/7/1075.abstract|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}</ref>

The medical costs for catastrophic injuries can be extremely high<U+2014>a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs of someone who has high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is [[United States dollar|USD]] $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that [[Booster club|boosters]] help families pay for these policies.<ref name="Special report: Some Texas schools fail to provide catastrophic care for injuries" />

Catastrophic injuries have been on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as [[spearing (gridiron football)|spearing]], face tackling and butt blocking.<ref name="'Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising" /> However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground.<ref name="Belson14" /> Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.<ref name="'Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising">{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Lisa|title='Catastrophic' Head Injuries to High School Football Players Rising|url=http://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-and-neurological-health-information-26/brain-health-news-80/catastrophic-head-injuries-to-high-school-football-players-rising-663944.html|publisher=[[HealthDay]]|accessdate=November 28, 2013|date=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

Fatalities in football are rare. A 2013 study of high school and college football players split fatalities into two types: direct fatalities, defined as those caused by "trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury" and indirect fatalities, defined as those resulting from external factors such as "[[cardiac failure]], [[heat illness]], [[sickle cell trait]] [SCT], [[asthma]], or [[pulmonary embolism]]". The study found that, on average, there are 4 direct fatalities and 8.2 indirect fatalities among high school and college players per year, making indirect fatalities more than twice as common as direct fatalities.<ref name=Boden13>{{cite journal |last=Boden |first=Barry |last2=Breit |first2=Ilan |last3=Beachler |first3=Jason |last4=Williams |first4=Aaron |last5=Mueller |first5=Frederick |date=11 March 2013 |title=Fatalities in High School and College Football Players |url=http://www.theorthocentermd.com/articles/fatalities_in_hiigh_school_and_college_2013.pdf |journal=AJSM PreView |doi=10.1177/0363546513478572 |accessdate=13 December 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131213203715/http://www.theorthocentermd.com/articles/fatalities_in_hiigh_school_and_college_2013.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2013}}</ref>

==Effects on post-career life==

In addition to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A [[cohort study|cohort mortality study]] by researchers at the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988.<ref name=Lehman>{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=EJ |last2=Hein |first2=MJ |last3=Baron |first3=SL |last4=Gersic |first4=CM |year=2012 |title=Neurodegenerative causes of death among retired National Football League players |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |publisher=American Academy of Neurology |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e31826daf50 |url=http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2012/09/05/WNL.0b013e31826daf50.full.pdf+html |accessdate=25 November 2013 |pmid=22955124 |volume=79 |issue=19 |pages=1970<U+2013>4}}</ref> The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]]. In particular, the risk of death from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male.<ref name = Lehman/> The study also compared mortality risks from speed players ([[quarterback]]s, [[halfback (American football)|running backs]], [[fullback (American football)|fullbacks]], [[wide receiver]]s, [[tight end]]s, [[linebacker]]s, [[cornerback]]s, and [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safeties]]) and nonspeed players ([[lineman (American football)|offensive and defensive linemen]]), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This may be due to the increased momentum of collisions from speed players.<ref name=Lehman/>

Outside of neurodegenerative disorders, physical injuries sustained during a career can have an adverse effect on post-career life. A 1990 survey conducted jointly between the NFLPA and [[Ball State University]] found that 65% of surveyed players had suffered a major injury (defined as one that caused them to miss at least eight games): among players that played before 1959 this number was 42%, but it jumps to 72% among those who played in the 1980s. Additionally, roughly 50% of players who had played in the 1970s and 1980s reported that they retired due to injury, compared to only 32% among those who played prior to 1959. Two-thirds of players reported that injuries they had sustained limited their ability to engage in recreational activity and sports in retirement, while half said their injuries decreased their ability to perform manual labor. A follow-up survey in 1994 found that 47% of recipients reported having [[arthritis]]. These reports have been attributed to several factors, including the increase in the use of [[artificial turf]] as well as the increasing size and speed of players. Dr. [[James Andrews (physician)|James Andrews]], a noted orthopedic surgeon, said that "athletes are bigger, stronger and running faster, and they're tearing up knees from cutting, changing direction on a dime". Andrews also noted the increase in the number of non-contact [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) injuries, which he attributed to the size of modern players.<ref name="The Wrecking Yard">{{cite web|last=Nack|first=William|title=The Wrecking Yard|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022464/1/index.htm|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=November 26, 2013|date=May 7, 2001}}</ref>

==Prevention==
[[File:Leather football helmet (circa 1930's).JPG|200px|right|thumb|Leather helmets, the predecessor of modern football helmets, were designed to protect players from head injuries.]]

Injuries have always been a part of football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method that has been used to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this is the elimination of mass formations like the [[flying wedge]] in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused.<ref name="Football History 101: Weapons of Mass Formation">{{cite web|last=Warner|first=David J.|title=Football History 101: Weapons of Mass Formation|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2006/09/30/football-history-101-weapons-of-mass-formation/|publisher=[[AOL Inc.{{!}}AOL News]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=September 30, 2005}}</ref> Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL;<ref name="Mindful of Violence, the N.F.L.

Similarly, modern equipment was developed to reduce injuries. The [[football helmet]], although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like [[skull fractures]].<ref name="Can Football Finally Tackle Its Injury Problem?"/> The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s to protect themselves from head injuries.<ref name="Did the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, also invent the football helmet?f">{{cite web|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Did the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, also invent the football helmet?|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/12/sports-legend-revealed-did-the-inventor-of-basketball-james-naismith-also-invent-the-football-helmet.html|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=December 7, 2010}}</ref> Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries.<ref name="Face of the NFL is gone: An ode to the single-bar">{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Tim|title=Face of the NFL is gone: An ode to the single-bar|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/2102/face-of-the-nfl-is-gone-an-ode-to-the-single-bar|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 9, 2013|date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> Many players also wear [[mouthguard]]s to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues;<ref name="The American Football Player's Uniform">{{cite web|title=The American Football Player's Uniform|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-american-football-players-uniform.html|publisher=[[For Dummies{{!}}Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 11, 2013|author=Long, Howie|authorlink=Howie Long|coauthors=John Czarnecki}}</ref> at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory.<ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 22">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p. 22.</ref> Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves - [[shoulder pad]]s are the most important pads, protecting the [[shoulder]] and [[sternum]], but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their [[ribcage]]. [[Cleat (shoe)|Cleats]] come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field - on [[artificial turf]], for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction.<ref name="The American Football Player's Uniform" /> [[Jockstrap#Protective cup|Athletic cups]] are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the [[groin]] area.<ref name="Helmet?
