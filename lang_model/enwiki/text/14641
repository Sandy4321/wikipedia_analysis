{{nihongo|'''Chibiusa'''|<U+3061><U+3073><U+3046><U+3055>|}} (as said in Act 11); legally '''Usagi Tsukino''' and formally '''Usagi Small Lady Serenity Tsukino''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[manga]]/[[anime]] ''[[Sailor Moon]]''. In the English-language adaptations, she is known as '''Rini''', a diminutive form of the name [[Usagi Tsukino|Serena]]. 

Her exact age was not disclosed in the anime, and her visits from the future complicate guessing. It can be estimated at approximately five years old when she is introduced (the candles on her birthday cake in one memory indicate so), and perhaps eleven or twelve later on. In the manga, where it is implied her growth was magically impeded, under different circumstances, she is 902 years old.

Her first appearance as Chibiusa is in Episode 60 of the anime (54 in the dub), while Sailor Chibi Moon doesn't appear until Episode 103 (96). In the manga, Chibiusa's first appearance is in Act 13, and Sailor Chibi Moon appears in Act 23.


{{spoiler}}
==Character overview==
[[image:bssm9.png|left|thumb|Chibiusa]]
She is the [[future child|daughter]] of [[Usagi Tsukino]] and [[Mamoru Chiba]], and was sent back in time to the "present" (Early [[1990s]] AD) to stay with them before she was born. Her real name is the same as her mother's, but is called ''Chibiusa'' in Japanese (and ''Rini'' in English) to avoid confusion between the two.  Her name in the [[English language|English-language]] [[Sailor Moon (English version)|version of Sailor Moon]], ''Rini'', is a diminutive of "Serena", the name of her mother. She is known for having pink hair put into a unique style that resembles rabbit ears on top of her head. Unlike the other anime characters, whose hair colors were colored differently for stylistic/identification purposes, Chibiusa's hair is apparently actually pink. The anime characters make several references and even tease the child about her pink hair.

Usagi is constantly fighting with her, and dislikes her (it's more a sort of sisterly rivalry than real hate, though) because she is close to Mamoru. Chibiusa's affections come into conflict because she generally does not immediately identify Usagi and Mamoru as being her parents from the future, although she is aware of the fact. There is evidence that Chibusa has a hard time identifying Usagi and Mamoru as being her future parents since she sees such a sharp contrast in personality between the entities. She also reacts differently toward Usagi and Mamoru than she does towards King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity, being more respectful to the latter but more spontaneous to the former; it is not clear if she prefers one set over the other. It is clear she has more friends in the 20th century rather than the 30th century; some kids used to bully her since she seemed to have no powers of her own.

==Important manga plotlines==
===Black Moon arc===
Chibiusa appears from the future, asking for the ''Maboroshi no Ginzuishou'' ([[Mystical Silver Crystal]]) to save her mother, Neo-Queen Serenity. Chibiusa also is nicknamed Chibiusa by Mamoru to keep the two Usagis apart. (Her full name is Princess Usagi Small Lady Serenity Tsukino, when she becomes older she will become Princess Usagi Lady Serenity Tsukino. She does not have the surname of Chiba, probably due to a [[matrilineal]] succession.)
She knew all along that Usagi was her mother, but found it hard to believe that this klutzy, lazy girl would become the elegant Queen of Crystal Tokyo. Chibiusa came to the present to find "the invincible Sailor Moon", of whom her father King Endymion had told her many stories, and bring her to the future to save it. It turns out that the small princess had suffered much teasing and scorn from the people of Crystal Tokyo, because she had not emotionally or physically aged since she was about 5 or 6 years old, and hardly looked like her mother.  The people doubted her to be the true princess. At the time, she is about 900 years old, due to the extended lifespan of the Lunar Royal Family (we're first told by King Endymion that this is her age, but another clue is given to us in the Dream Arc of the manga, when Chibiusa complains of not growing up fast enough despite being 903. One would assume that a few years had passed between the Black Moon and Dream Arcs, so this puts her at about 900-901 in the Black Moon saga). Unable to taking the teasing any longer, Chibiusa went to steal the Ginzuishou and prove she could use, that she was truly her mother's child. Once she took it, the Earth was immediately open and vulnerable to attack, an opportunity the Black Moon Family gladly took. 
The attack was instantaneous, as were its consequences. The Ginzuishou immediately covered Neo-Queen Serenity in a cocoon-like sheath of crystal to protect her, and since she has been in a coma, recovering her strength. King Endymion and the Inner Senshi took full brunt of the blast, and also have fallen into a coma. King Endymion's spirit, however, has removed itself from the body, and roams the Crystal Palace.
When Crystal Tokyo fell into stasis due to the large Dark Crystal monolith that drained the city of life, Chibiusa went to the Gates of Time, leaving her beloved Guardian Cat Diana behind (who wanted to stay hy her parents, Luna and Artemis). Once there, she stole a Time Key from her beloved friend Sailor Pluto, knowing full well that what she was doing was taboo and breaking her friend's trust.

She later becomes Black Lady (Wicked Lady in the english adaptation) through deception. The Wiseman finds her when she is lost in the Fourth Dimension, and preys upon her fears and hurts from her life of scorn. She becomes drunk with power, unleashing her hurt by throwing more Dark Crystal monoliths into the Earth, deteriorating it further and faster. Clearly she is not stable in this false adulthood, as her attitude is still very child-like and seeking the childish approval from The Wiseman. 
Chibiusa awakens as herself, and as Sailor Chibi Moon when Sailor Pluto sacrifices herself to stop time, preventing Prince Diamond from putting the Ginzuishou of the past and future together (In the Anime version of Sailor Moon, it was Neo-Queen Serenity's reasonings that brought her back to normal). The Ginzuishou came from her tear she cried for her beloved friend, much like Usagi had with Mamoru. The realization that she is loved allows her to be healed. This also produces Small Lady's own crystal, the ''ginzuishou'' of the future, and manifests her power as the future soldier, Sailor Chibi-Moon.

===Infinity arc===
Chibiusa meets Hotaru and becomes friends with her. She learns how to use attacks and how to make friends. Her ''ginzuishou'' is stolen by the Death Busters. She also acquires a new transformation and attack.

===Dream arc===
Chibiusa gets a new transformation and attack that she does with Sailor Moon. She discovers that she will become the leader of a future group of Sailor Senshi <U+2014> the [[Amazoness Quartet|Sailor Quartet]].

===Stars arc===
In the manga, Chibiusa returns to the future to find that it is in ruin. She returns to the past with her Sailor Senshi, the [[Amazoness Quartet|Sailor Quartet]]. They are the ones who kill [[Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon]] with their group attack ''Pink Ladies Freezing Kiss'' in Act 49, saving Sailor Moon and the [[Sailor Starlights]] from certain death. Chibiusa shows up in the Cauldron after Sailor Moon destroys Chaos to say that she will see Usagi in the 30th Century.
In the final act, it is obvious Usagi is pregnant with her.

==Important anime plotlines==
===''Sailormoon R''===
Chibiusa travels back in time to save her mother, Neo-Queen Serenity, from the Black Moon clan by stealing her past self's Silver Crystal, the source of Sailor Moon's power. At the end of the series, she is brainwashed by [[Death Phantom]] which causes her to age prematurely, becoming '''Black Lady''' ('''Wicked Lady''' in the [[DiC]] version).

===''Sailormoon S''===
Chibiusa is sent from the future to train to be a [[Sailor Senshi]]. She becomes '''Sailor Chibi Moon''' ('''Sailor Mini Moon''' in the [[English language|English]] version) and uses attacks such as "Pink Sugar Heart Attack", which are often used as distraction tools rather than actual attacks. Also, all nine of the Sailor Senshi unite, and Sailor Saturn, the soldier of Destruction, is introduced.

===''Sailormoon SuperS''===
She becomes involved with Pegasus, a winged horse that appears in her dreams. She is arguably the center of attention in this series which revolves around her and her relationship with Pegasus, who is in reality the guardian of Elysian, Helios.

===''Sailor Stars''===
She teams up with Hotaru Tomoe (Sailor Saturn) to prevent [[Queen Nehellenia]] from changing history in the first story arc. She is later caught in a [[grandfather paradox|time paradox]] when Mamoru nearly dies by Nehellenia's hands. She is subsequently not involved in the anime except in a short dream sequence near the end. At the start of this series there is a picture of her along with Usagi and Mamoru, placed in Usagi's bedroom, but in subsequent scenes where that photo is displayed, she is nowhere to be seen.

==Important live-action plotlines==
===''Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon'' Special act===
Though Chibiusa was not present in the series, in the Special Act it is alluded to the viewer that [[Usagi Tsukino|Usagi]] may be pregnant with her, as she frequently gets [[morning sickness]] in many scenes of the Act.

==Items==
* ''"Luna-P" ("Lunaball"/"Luna Sphere" in the [[DiC]] version)'' &mdash; The black, cathead-shaped ball that Chibiusa always has with her. She uses it for many different magical feats.
* ''"Key of Space-Time" (Japanese: ''jikuu no kagi'')'' &mdash; The item that Chibiusa uses to travel through time.
* ''"Maboroshi no Ginzuishou"'' (Illusion or Mystical Silver Crystal) &mdash; Chibiusa has the Ginzuishou from the future.
* ''"Prism Heart Compact"'' &mdash; Sailor Chibi Moon's first transformation compact.
* ''"Pink Moon Stick"'' &mdash; Sailor Chibi Moon's first Sailor Senshi weapon.
* ''"Chibi Moon Compact"'' &mdash; Transformation compact given to her by Pegasus.
* ''"Crystal Carillon"'' &mdash; Bell that she used to call on Pegasus.
* ''"Stallion Reve"'' &mdash; This item was used to communicate with Pegasus when she was not in battle.
* ''"Golden Mirror"'' &mdash; Chibiusa's dream mirror which allows her to stay in touch with Pegasus.
* ''"Pink Moon Crystal"'' &mdash; Chibiusa's personal [[Sailor Crystals|Sailor Crystal]].

==Senshi powers==
===Transformations===
* ''Moon Prism Power!  Make-Up!'' &mdash; Used to transform into Sailor Chibi Moon. In the English anime, Rini does not say ''Make-up'', and the phrase ''Mini Prism Power'' is used instead in some cases.
* ''Crisis!  Make-Up!'' &mdash; (Manga only) Used to transform into Super Sailor Chibi Moon.
* ''Moon Crisis!  Make-Up!'' &mdash; Used to transform into Super Sailor Chibi Moon. In the anime, she uses this transformation in conjunction with [[Usagi Tsukino|Sailor Moon]].  In the English version it is called ''Moon Cosmic Dream Action'', or in SuperS movie ''Super Moon Crisis Power''
* ''Pink Moon Crystal Power!  Make-Up!'' &mdash; (Manga only) Used to transform into Sailor Chibi Moon.

Most of these transformations in the anime commonly involve the use of shiny red or pink [[ribbon]]s that usually form the [[leotard]], boots, and [[glove]]s. They, when de-transforming, form her civilian clothes, come out of the locket to wrap around her, or disappear.

===Powers===
* ''Abracadabra Pon!'' &mdash; Used to change Luna-P into various items. In the Japanese anime, this power was called ''Luna-P Henge''. In the English anime it was called ''Kitty Magic''.
* ''Luna-P Magic!'' &mdash; This is used in the anime to change Luna-P into something innocuous like flowers.
* ''Travelling Through Time'' &mdash; Chibiusa used a special incantation to call upon the Guardian of Time to open the Time Gate.
* ''Garlic Attack!'' &mdash; Chibiusa used her garlicy breath to attack a vampire in the manga. A variation of this was seen in the anime's SuperS special.
* ''Moon Princess Halation!'' &mdash; Chibiusa used this attack with [[Usagi Tsukino|Sailor Moon]] in the manga.
* ''Pink Sugar Heart Attack!'' &mdash; Chibiusa's first attack as a Sailor Soldier, it shot pink hearts from her Pink Moon Stick. In the anime, this attack is generally ineffective - it occasionally does not travel sufficient distance to harm a monster (drooping to the ground) or doesn't work at all. When it does actually effect an opponent, the damage it deals is generally only equivalent to a slap or spanking, although she once powered it up enough to destroy several of Tellu's plants.
* ''Rainbow Double Moon Heart Ache!'' &mdash; A manga-only attack used by Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon.
* ''Pink Sugar Tuxedo Attack!'' &mdash; Used in combination with [[Mamoru Chiba|Tuxedo Mask]]. This attack is only used in the manga.
* ''Twinkle Yell!'' &mdash; In both the manga and the anime, this power is used to call upon Pegasus. In the English anime, this power is called ''Crystal Twinkle Bell'' or just ''Twinkle Bell''.
* ''Moon Gorgeous Meditation!'' &mdash; In the manga, this attack was a team-up used by both Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon. It was also used in the anime but only once.
* ''Submarine Mirror!'' &mdash; (Manga only). Used by Chibi Moon to transport her to where Sailor Neptune is located.
* ''Starlight Honeymoon Double Therapy Kiss!'' &mdash; A team-up attack used in the manga by Sailor Chibi Moon and [[Eternal Sailor Moon]] to destroy the evil spirit possessing [[Hotaru Tomoe]].
* ''Pink Ladies Freezing Kiss!'' &mdash; A team-up attack with the [[Amazoness Quartet|Sailor Quartetto]] in the manga.
