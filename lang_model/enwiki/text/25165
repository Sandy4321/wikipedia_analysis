'''Hot Stuff the Little Devil''' is a [[comic book]] character who first appeared in ''Hot Stuff'' #1, published by [[Harvey Comics]] in October 1957. Harvey must have had unusual confidence - blind launches were rare. The character didn't first appear as a back-up feature in another book or receive a trial run in [[Harvey Hits]]. Imbued with a mischievous personality and able to produce fire, Hot Stuff appears as a vermillion red child devil who wears baby diapers (said to be made of [[asbestos]]) and carries a magical pitchfork (referred to as his "trusty trident").  However to the consternation of his demonic brethren, Hot Stuff sometimes performs good deeds to irritate them. The pitchfork is sentient and a character in its own right.

Created and first drawn by [[Warren Kremer]], Hot Stuff has appeared in at least eight comic book titles including ''[[Hot Stuff Sizzlers]]'' (from 1960), ''[[Devil Kids Starring Hot Stuff]]'' (from 1962), and ''[[Hot Stuff Creepy Caves]]'' (from 1974) as well and multiple back-up stories from 1957 to 1982 , 1986 to 91, and with some later publications briefly during the 90's. The character has not been published in comics since then.

[[Warren Kremer]] and [[Howard Post]] were the artists who helped define the look of Hot Stuff, drawing many comic book covers and stories over the years.

Unlike the other main characters in the Harvey universe like [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] and [[Wendy the Good Little Witch]], who crossed over into one another's stories, Hot Stuff was written with a strong tendency to remain separate, in his own world. This includes [[Stumbo the Giant]] (created by [[Warren Kremer]] and [[Larz Bourne]]) as a back-up in Hot Stuff in 1957. They shared the inside of many comics together, without, it would seem, ever getting to know one another. However, crossovers with [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]] and [[Wendy the Good Little Witch|Wendy]] were not completely unheard of.
