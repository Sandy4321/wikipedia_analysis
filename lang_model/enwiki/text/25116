'''''Concerned''''' (Full title: '''''Concerned: The Half-Life and Death of Gordon Frohman''''') is a [[webcomic]] by Christopher C. Livingston, parodying the popular [[first-person shooter]] [[Video game|computer game]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]''.  The comic was constructed from game screenshots, with characters posed using [[Garry's Mod]]. Livingston originally released issues on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday basis, but changed the schedule to two new issues every week on Tuesday and Thursday, citing his job.<ref name="update change"/> The comic was launched in May 1, 2005 and completed its run on October 31, 2006, with a total of 205 issues.

Livingston had stated that the comic will not continue through ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'', (the first of an [[Episodic games|episodic]] series following ''Half-Life 2''), as it "''doesn't really lend itself to the type of comic [he wants] to do.''"<ref name="EpisodeOne">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-16 ''Concerned'' #183]. URL accessed on [[August 16]], [[2006]].</ref> In addition, the comic's plot had become incompatible with ''Episode One''.<ref name="EpisodeOne2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-26 ''Concerned'' #203].

==Plot==

In ''Half-Life 2'', the player takes on the role of [[Gordon Freeman]]. Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, [[dystopia]]n future in which mankind has been enslaved by the [[Combine (Half-Life 2)|Combine]], a mysterious alien enemy.

In contrast, ''Concerned'' follows the same general path through the story established by ''Half-Life 2'', but instead follows the adventures of Gordon ''Frohman'', a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in [[City 17]] a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman is incredibly na<U+00EF>ve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Breen]] and the [[Combine (Half-Life 2)|Combine]]. He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier. Indeed (as happened in Ravenholm) he finds it hard to cope without their omnipresence, and goes to the lengths of building his own [[List of Combine non-combat technology in Half-Life 2#The Citadel|Citadel]] out of crates, a [[telescreen]] for watching [[Wallace Breen#Breencasts|Breencasts]] and an apparently fully functional [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Strider|Strider]] (although he never turns it on)<ref name=ravenhold> {{cite web | url = http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-11-28 | title = ''Concerned'' #81}} URL accessed on [[September 16]], [[2007]]</ref>.

The early phases of the comic has Frohman excitedly arriving in City 17, eventually landing a job in the Citadel, under a Combine Elite named Mr. Henderson. As most of his human colleagues became Combine soldiers, Frohman realized that Henderson has no immediate intention to do the same for Frohman (citing his incompetence). Demanding that he become one with the Combine, Frohman willingly sets off to [[Nova Prospekt]] for invasive surgery to join the Overwatch. Meanwhile, Frohman selects [[Ravenholm]] as a residence where he can commute to and from City 17, but lacks proper transport to visit the town. After a failed attempt to reach Ravenholm using [[Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Isaac Kleiner]]'s teleporter (leaving him stuck on a ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' server for a week), Frohman, in frustration, chooses to seek Ravenholm by foot instead.

Traveling through City 17's canals, Frohman lands himself in trouble by meeting several [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Civil Protection|Civil Protection]] units and  a female Resistance member, Sandy, only to have her abandon him later for her own safety, as Frohman is accident prone. (Sandy ends up consumed by a Barnacle, ironically she abandons Frohman because she fears his accident prone nature would kill her.) Frohman continues by obtaining a small boat that aids his travel along the city's wider canals and rivers, and finally arrives, badly injured and dazed, at [[Black Mesa East]], where he is welcomed as a helper. His stay there is cut short after causing trouble in the base, as well as his irritating overuse of the gravity gun. Frohman is fooled into leaving the place, and finally heads toward and reaches Ravenholm.

During Frohman's arrival, [[Ravenholm]] is depicted as a peaceful, bright and cheerful place devoid of any Combine elements, but "terrorized" by [[Father Grigori]]. After adjusting, Frohman becomes accustomed to the town, but unintentionally discloses the town's location to Dr. Breen, allowing Breen to order a [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Headcrab shell and launcher|headcrab shelling]] of the town, killing many. Frohman is attacked by a [[headcrab]] and turns into a [[Headcrab#Standard headcrab zombie|headcrab zombie]] (but retains his [[free will]]). But in time, Frohman's headcrab dies of malnutrition (attributed to his lack of intelligence), allowing him to retrieve a first aid kit and completely recover. With Father Grigori's help, Frohman escapes Ravenholm, now a zombie-infested town, and presses on to Nova Prospekt.

After crossing mine shafts filled with headcrabs and a railway line guarded by Combine snipers, Frohman reaches the Coast and obtains a rusty bicycle from another Resistance base (although they tried to offer him a car he was too incompetent to listen to them). En route, Frohman stumbles across St. Olga (the setting of ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast]]'') and another ''Counter-Strike'' server, as well as dressing up as a Combine soldier. After passing Lighthouse Point and an [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)|Antlion]]-infested beach, Frohman encounters an [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)#Antlion Guards and "bugbait"|Antlion Guard]], which would be killed by a [[Vortigaunt]] from a nearby base. This allows Frohman to retrieve "[[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Antlion Pheropod (Bugbait)|bugbait]]s" (although an earlier try resulted in him retrieving an Antlion Guard's [[feces]]), and control Antlions.

Frohman, accompanied by several "bugbait"-controlled Antlions, eventually reaches [[Nova Prospekt]], only to be turned away as he did not have an appointment<ref name="TurnedAwayAtNP">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-05 ''Concerned'' #145]. URL accessed on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>. Frohman gives up and returns to City 17 in the following strip, content of the city's provisions, as Gordon ''Freeman'' finally arrives in the city, linking the comic's time frame with the start of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name="FreemansThere">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-08 ''Concerned'' #146].

[[Image:Gordon Frohman as Medic.jpg|thumb|200px|Gordon Frohman dressed up as a [[medic]] in strip [http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-23 #165].]]

Frohman is recruited into the Resistance (handled by [[Barney Calhoun]]), failing to disrupt their operations. He unintentionally signals the start of the Resistance's uprising after accidentally killing a [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Civil Protection|Civil Protection]] unit using one of his Antlions. During the fighting, Frohman settles into the role of Resistance medic, running his own medical practice (for a brief period), accompanying Freeman himself and mingling with Resistance members, aiding the Combine in the capture of [[Alyx Vance]], reuniting with Norman Frohman (Gordon's long-lost assassin twin brother), and witnessing Norman's death.

Following this, Frohman returns to the Citadel, unwillingly aiding Freeman in his journey up the Citadel and influencing the plot of the game, with [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Overwatch Elite|Overwatch Elite]] soldier Henderson fired in the process. After Freeman is captured, brought to Dr. Breen, freed and pursuing Dr. Breen to his teleporter, Frohman attempts to kill Freeman, donning his old rebel clothing and arming himself with a crossbow. He spends too long trying to come up with a [[One-liner joke|one liner]], and Dr. Breen's teleporter explodes. Frohman falls off the Citadel peak, flung off by the explosion.

Dr. Breen is also alive, having fallen from the Citadel onto a pile of dead Combine soldiers. However, Frohman falls right onto Breen, killing the latter, but remains alive (although seriously injured). Baffled by his ability to survive, Frohman realizes through a flashback that he has been under "[[Buddha]] Mode" (a variation of [[god mode]] which prevents his health point from dropping below one) through the comic's duration. Frohman inadvertently turns off the mode, and even spoils an opportunity to be rescued by a group of purple [[Vortigaunt]]s (as both Gordon Freeman and [[Alyx Vance]] would at the start of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]''). In the end, Frohman dies unceremoniously, while survivors of the City 17 uprising tend to other wounded in the area.

== Theme ==

Much of the comic's dark humor is derived from its contrasts with ''Half-Life 2'': in a depressing, dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly-named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average guy, improbably cheerful to the point of stupidity, and somewhat na<U+00EF>ve as to what is actually going on around him (for instance, Frohman fails to realise that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed or otherwise compromised).

The comic contains many references to events and objects in the game. In one comic, Frohman makes a clerical error that causes the Combine to order far too many explosive barrels,<ref name="100kBarrels">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-06-24 ''Concerned'' #021]. URL accessed on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref> thus suggesting an explanation for the barrels' ubiquity throughout City 17 and beyond. In another strip, he writes a letter to Dr. Breen asking why using his flashlight reduces his ability to run,<ref name="SharedPower">[http://www.hlcomic.com/view.php?date=2005-06-22 ''Concerned'' #020]. URL accessed on [[July 25]], [[2006]].</ref> a reference to ''Half-Life 2'''s flashlight and sprint functions using the same power source. In another, his presence in the town of [[Ravenholm]] ends with it becoming the [[headcrab]]-infested [[ghost town]] seen in ''Half-Life 2'' (after he wrote to Breen expressing his happiness with being there, giving away Ravenholm's location). Indeed, Frohman seems to (intentionally or accidentally) cause many of the disastrous circumstances that Gordon Freeman runs across, as he accidentally gives Breen the idea of headcrab shells while on a radio, and sets up all of the traps in Ravenholm himself in attempts to catch or kill Father Grigori. Along with that, it is revealed that, at the Black Mesa Research Facility, he caused the Black Mesa Incident by accidentally delivering a wedge of cheese to the test chamber, giving the explanation that the borderworld is apparently very "[[Lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]]."<ref name="Cheese">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-04 ''Concerned'' #178]. URL accessed on [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref>{{ref|Decay_note}} Other events that had resulted from Frohman's intervention and developed into the scenes seen by Gordon Freeman include:

* Frohman writing a letter to Dr. Breen,<ref name="Reproduction letter">[http://hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-06-07 ''Concerned'' #013]. URL accessed on [[October 18]], [[2006]].</ref> in which he complains about not feeling any sexual desire for the beautiful women he sees around, blaming the [[Combine (Half-Life 2)#Suppression field|Combine reproductive suppression field]], which later resulted in Breen personally reciting "part" of the letter early in ''Half-Life 2'' (the origin of the strip's title).{{ref|Reproduction_note}}
* Devastates a Resistance outpost, Station Seven, by unintentionally disclosing their location and inspiring the Combine to develop [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Headcrab shell and launcher|headcrab shell]]s (one of which is also seen in Station Seven during ''Half-Life 2'').<ref name="Station Seven">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-12 ''Concerned'' #064] URL accessed on [[November 20]], [[2006]].</ref>
* Angering Antlions in the Coast by running over a few of them using his bicycle. The comic claims that Antlions are "normally fairly docile creatures."<ref name="Docile Antlions">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-04-03 ''Concerned'' #132] URL accessed on [[November 20]], [[2006]].</ref>
* Stranding two citizens in the middle of an Antlion infested territory near a beach.<ref name="StrandingCitizens">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-03 ''Concerned'' #144] URL accessed on [[September 13]], [[2006]].</ref>
* Accidentally aiding the human Resistance in obtaining large amounts of weapons for their uprising.
* Inspiring Breen to keep the security alert going despite the fact Freeman had sealed himself in a metal container that he cannot open from the inside or control where it goes.
* Causing the weapon confiscation field to "upgrade" Gordon Freeman's gravity gun with increased power and the ability to manipulate organic matter (namely, Combine soldiers).

As such, the comic is chiefly targeted towards those who have played the game, but short "notes" sections appended to many of the comics attempt to give non-players some context. Since ''Concerned'' follows a similar path through the ''Half-Life 2'' universe as the game, the comic contains spoilers for those who have not yet played it.

It is also apparent that Frohman may be aware of his existence in ''Half-Life 2'',<ref name="Game.IMeanWorld">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-10 ''Concerned'' #007]. URL accessed on [[June 16]], [[2006]].</ref> and also referenced the time period<ref name="PostApocalypticPresent">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-06-08 ''Concerned'' #014].

URL accessed on [[June 11]], [[2006]].</ref> of the game, breaking the [[fourth wall]] of the comic to an extent.

Livingston admitted he didn't play ''Decay'', thus having not been aware of its storyline.<ref name="BlackMesaIncident">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-07 ''Concerned'' #179].

== Name ==
''Concerned'' derives its name from one of the propaganda broadcasts by Dr. Breen in ''Half-Life 2'' in which he is reading a letter supposedly written by a citizen:
<blockquote>"''Let me read a letter I recently received. 'Dear Dr. Breen. Why has the Combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle? Sincerely, a concerned citizen.' Thank you for writing, Concerned.''"</blockquote>

Frohman is a big fan of Dr. Breen, writing frequent letters to the administrator and calling his broadcasts "The Dr. Breen Show." In [http://www.hlcomic.com/view.php?date=2005-06-07 one letter] in which Frohman complains "I got no angle in my dangle! You feel me?", he finishes with the part Breen reads in his announcement (but not without adding a [[postscript]], "PS: Seriously! Frohman gots to get his freak on! PPS: I love your show! You rock! [[List of Internet slang|TTYL]]!"). Thus, Frohman is intended to be "Concerned".

== Additional information ==
=== Combine funeral and mourning strips ===
During Gordon Freeman's run through Highway 17, his actions are shown from the Combine's perspective; after killing a soldier named Frank with a lawn chair launched from the gravity gun, several follow-up strips track his funeral and mourning by companions (and his two children), in a faux-serious style. Some readers took the strips seriously, not having considered the impact Freeman's constant struggle had against his enemies. (This coincidentally mirrors a statement by Breen in ''Half-Life 2'', directed at Gordon Freeman - "''You have destroyed so much. What is it, exactly, that you have created? Can you name even one thing? I thought not.''")

The author has stated that the strips were not intended to be serious. ("''I will never intentionally be serious, deep, meaningful, or poignant here. Ever.''"<ref name="CombineFuneral">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-22 ''Concerned'' #152]. URL accessed on [[June 11]], [[2006]].</ref>) Livingston assured his readers that, on the contrary, the comic was only meant to be comical, perhaps in a similar fashion to an ''[[Austin Powers]]'' scene involving the families of the homogeneous "evil henchmen" Powers has killed.

=== Recurring gags ===
Chris Livingston often makes references to earlier strips of Concerned, once noting: "Here at ''Concerned'', we care about the environment. That's why we recycle jokes as often as possible."<ref name="VortKill2 100kSupplyCrates">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-11-07 ''Concerned'' #073]. URL accessed on [[June 24]], [[2006]].</ref> Some of these recurring themes include:

* '''Shooting vortigaunts''' - In ''Half-Life'', [[vortigaunt]]s are a common alien enemy of the main character. However, in ''Half-Life 2'', the vortigaunts are now allies. Gordon Freeman ends up working with the vortigaunts, while Gordon Frohman has a hard time accepting this, and his first impulse upon seeing a vortigaunt is to shoot it.<ref name="VortKill1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-09-19 ''Concerned'' #054]. URL accessed on [[September 13]], [[2006]].</ref> <ref name="VortKill2 100kSupplyCrates"/> <ref name="VortKill3">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-04-14 ''Concerned'' #137]. URL accessed on [[September 13]], [[2006]].</ref> However, it is impossible in ''Half-Life 2'' for the main character to kill friendly units, and ''Concerned'' mirrors this. This particular behavior led to Frohman's downfall. As he lays dying, purple Vortigaunts emerge to save him (in the style of ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening scenes). However, Gordon attempts to kill them, and they change their mind.<ref name="VortKill4">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-26 ''Concerned'' #203]. URL accessed on [[November 1]], [[2006]].</ref>

* '''Ordering 100,000 _______s''' - Frohman tends to work at keyboards where he claims "the zero key sticks," resulting in him ordering large number of items abundant in ''Half-Life 2'', including explosive barrels<ref name="100kBarrels"/> (which resulted in barrels appearing in following strips, before the idea was no longer in use), supply crates,<ref name="VortKill2_100kSupplyCrates"/> sawblades,<ref name="100kSawblades">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-12-14 ''Concerned'' #088]. URL accessed on [[June 24]], [[2006]].</ref> and [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#City scanner|scanners]].<ref name="100kScanners">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-12 ''Concerned'' #148]. URL accessed on [[June 24]], [[2006]].</ref> However, during Frohman's time in Black Mesa, he is revealed to have done the opposite for long-jump modules on [[Gordon Freeman#H.E.V. suit|HEV suits]], by ordering only one instead of 100 of them.<ref name="1LongJumpModule">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-02 ''Concerned'' #177]. URL accessed on [[August 3]], [[2006]].</ref>

* '''''Counter-Strike''''' - ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' (''CS'') is the most popular [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] of the ''Half-Life'' series, spawning its own [[Counter-Strike culture|community]]. While events in the ''CS'' universe is intended to happen on a completely separate plotline from ''Half-Life'', Gordon Frohman has been teleported to a ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' (''CS:S'') server from Doctor Kleiner's lab<ref name="CSFirstTeleport">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-08-12 ''Concerned'' #040]. URL accessed on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>, and launched from a [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Headcrab shell and launcher|headcrab shell launcher]] in ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]'' into another ''CS:S'' map, inadvertently, and lethally, crushing a hostage NPC<ref name="CSHostageKill">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-02-08 ''Concerned'' #110]. URL accessed on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>. Livingston says that he's not much of a ''CS'' person, and ends up making jokes on the lesser points of the game (for example, exaggerating the fact that many players are immature and type in [[Leetspeak]]).

* '''The G-Man''' - Throughout ''Concerned'', Frohman has stumbled across the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]] in a manner similar to which Gordon Freeman does in ''Half-Life 2''; however, while the G-Man that Gordon Freeman knows is elusive and cryptic, Frohman has been able to converse or interact with him a few times; shattering his attempts at elusivity and "G-Peeps." The G-Man in Half-Life is known to disappear if followed, but The G-Man Frohman knows will appear to be gone when followed, but is really just hiding behind a box or up a lamppost. The G-Man has appeared at least once (obviously or otherwise) in every past chapter of the comic, except the prologue and epilogue strips. In ''Concerned-ish'', a set of guest strips released during one of Livingston's hiatus, it is indicated that there are numerous G-Men (who talk and act like normal humans - albeit with superhuman strength - and perceive the G-Man accompanying Freeman and Frohman as abnormal).

* '''"Frohman"-"Freeman" confusion''' - Gordon Frohman's name is an obvious play on words of Gordon Freeman, the main character of the ''Half-Life'' series. It's also the subject of confusion by several minor characters, who mistake him for Freeman,<ref name="Freeman-FrohmanConfusion1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-06 ''Concerned'' #004]. URL accessed on [[July 16]], [[2006]].</ref> <ref name="Freeman-FrohmanConfusion2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-07 ''Concerned'' #005]. URL accessed on [[July 16]], [[2006]].</ref> and vice-versa.<ref name="Freeman-FrohmanConfusion3">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-05-18 ''Concerned'' #150]. URL accessed on [[July 16]], [[2006]].</ref> A later strip goes further to depict Frohman being mistaken by Combine soldiers to be Freeman, by simply donning the same glasses the latter wears.<ref name="Freeman-FrohmanConfusion4">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-09 ''Concerned'' #180]. URL accessed on [[August 9]], [[2006]].</ref> At one point, Frohman even mistakes his own brother's name, Norman Frohman, for Norman Freeman. Despite these similarities, the personalities of both Frohman and Freeman are very different and distinguishable.

* '''Levitating objects''' - As an observation that when objects are picked up with the "use" key in ''Half-Life 2'', they are held in front of the player without any visible means of support. Frohman is depicted with this odd ability while holding certain objects,<ref name="LevitateObj1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-10 ''Concerned'' #007]. URL accessed on [[July 25]], [[2006]].</ref> <ref name="LevitateObj2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-07-29 ''Concerned'' #034]. URL accessed on [[July 25]], [[2006]].</ref> <ref name="LevitateObj3">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-06-29 ''Concerned'' #023]. URL accessed on [[July 25]], [[2006]].</ref> and is apparently aware of this.<ref name="LevitateObj1" />

* '''Medkits''' - The comic poked fun at the way medical kits (medkits) are used in ''Half-Life 2'' and first-person shooters in general. Medkits are found in abrupt places, are capable of removing Frohman's bloodstains and instantly disappear after use,<ref name="Medkits1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-09-07 ''Concerned'' #049]. URL accessed on [[July 30]], [[2006]].</ref> and later they are seen as a replacement for all medicine and doctors in general<ref name="Medkits2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-26 ''Concerned'' #166]. URL accessed on [[July 30]], [[2006]].</ref> and are activated by touch.<ref name="Medkits3">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-30 ''Concerned'' #168]. URL accessed on [[July 30]], [[2006]].</ref> A medkit has even been revealed to help Frohman recover from fully developed mutations of a [[Headcrab#Headcrab zombie|headcrab infestation]].<ref name="Medkits4">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-01-04 ''Concerned'' #095] URL accessed on [[September 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

* '''Photogenic''' - A running gag that started in the very first comic,<ref name="Photogenic1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-02 ''Concerned'' #001]. URL accessed on [[December 22]], [[2006]].</ref> the [[photogenic]] gag shows that Frohman is completely incapable of looking good in a [[photograph]], to the point where he looks downright absurd. He has stated that he believes himself to actually be photogenic,<ref name="Photogenic2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-05-08 ''Concerned'' #008]. URL accessed on [[December 22]], [[2006]].</ref> but photos drastically prove otherwise.<ref name="Photogenic3">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-03-22 ''Concerned'' #127]. URL accessed on [[December 22]], [[2006]].</ref>

* '''Flying shovel''' - In some instances, for one reason or another, Frohman is catapulted into the air, usually by means of potent explosives. However, he never carries his shovel on the way down. Because of this, it usually comes crashing down on Frohman or someone near-by.<ref name="Shovel1">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-28 ''Concerned'' #069]. URL accessed on [[December 22]], [[2006]].</ref>

=== Author's notes ===
Livingston usually includes a set of notes at the bottom of each comic, which he started doing with the first comic.  His notes range in length from one or two sentences to two to three paragraphs.  When Livingston first started the notes, the idea was to use the notes to explain to his readers how he made the comics.  This came from Livingston's love of director commentaries on DVDs that he watched.  However, the notes' purpose had slowly changed, with the notes of the more recent comics pertaining to anything from commentary on new games to the ins and outs of Livingston's daily life.

=== Trivia ===
{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
* Frohman hints that he may be [[Jew]]ish (replying "I'm really more of a [[synagogue]] kind of guy" when he is directed to a [[church]] on a nearby clifftop)<ref name="Jewish">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-02-03 ''Concerned'' #108]. URL accessed on [[June 7]], [[2006]].</ref>. He may, however, simply be grasping for an excuse not to climb the cliff, or he may have an aversion to churches due to his time in Ravenholm, where [[Father Grigori]] frequently and enigmatically told him to "head for the church" without actually telling him its location. This eventually sent Frohman into a vengeful fury<ref name="FGrigoriChurch">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-12-12 ''Concerned'' #087]. URL accessed on [[June 4]], [[2006]].</ref>.

* Frohman reminiscences working as a clerk at the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] for a few weeks. Despite having taken place years before ''Half-Life 2'', the younger Frohman looked exactly the same as he does during ''Half-Life 2''. He was also dressed in the same blue uniform worn by many citizens in ''Half-Life 2'', believing that he is a "trendsetter" and that everyone would be wearing it in the future.<ref name="CitizenUniform">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-07-28 ''Concerned'' #175]. URL accessed on [[June 7]], [[2006]].</ref> After unintentionally triggering the Black Mesa Incident, he is seen to have reestablished a love relationship between a [[Hazardous Environment Combat Unit|HECU]] soldier and a female [[Black Ops (Half-Life)|Black Ops]] assassin, and had a pet [[Gargantua (Half-Life)|Gargantua]] named "Herschel." Despite the outrageous nature of Frohman's exploits, it is evidenced to have happened, with a picture in Frohman's present possession depicting him, the soldier, the assassin and the Gargantua.<ref name="BlackMesaIncident"/>

* Gordon Frohman is known to have two relatives. He had a grandfather, named Morgan Frohman (presumably a spoof of [[Morgan Freeman]]'s name), who participated and died in [[World War II]], all while wearing a "[[zoot suit]]" and speaking in "period slang"<ref name="MorganFrohman">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-07 ''Concerned'' #158]. URL accessed on [[June 7]], [[2006]].</ref>. The flashback from World War II was made using ''[[Day of Defeat: Source]]'' content. Gordon is also revealed to have a long lost twin brother, Norman Frohman, who is "''a soldier [,] special ops [,] deadly with a weapon [and] deadlier unarmed,''"<ref name="NormanFrohman">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-11 ''Concerned'' #181]. URL accessed on [[August 12]], [[2006]].</ref> believing he is a bitter and world-weary action hero.<ref name="Norman the Hero">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-16 ''Concerned'' #183]. URL accessed on [[November 24]], [[2006]].</ref> Norman is significantly smarter and more rational than Gordon, even condemning Gordon's incompetence. He is killed after a Strider impales him during a battle at City 17's Overwatch Nexus. Ironically, Gordon almost accidentally saved him through his idiocy, (Norman saved Gordon earlier by pushing him away from an explosion, however Gordon merely thought that he did it because he was "a big mean jerk" and was going to push Norman out of revenge) but followed his brother's annoyed advice and tried to do the "smart" thing, leading to Norman's death.

* As revealed by conversations with his twin brother Norman, Gordon (and, presumably, Norman) was born on [[November 20]]<ref name="FrohmanBirthday">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-14 ''Concerned'' #182]. URL accessed on [[August 29]], [[2006]].</ref>, and is 39 years old<ref name="FrohmanAge">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-29 ''Concerned'' #186]. URL accessed on [[August 29]], [[2006]].</ref>.

* The names of all chapters of the comic (except the prologue and epilogue) are [[pun]]s of those seen in ''Half-Life 2'', and at times relay the theme of the chapters in the comic:
**'''Pointless Insertion''' - Chapter 1: Point Insertion
**'''A Read Letter Day''' - Chapter 2: "A Red Letter Day"
**'''Route Banal''' - Chapter 3: Route Kanal
**'''Water Haphazard''' - Chapter 4: Water Hazard
**'''Black Mesa Guest''' - Chapter 5: Black Mesa East
**'''We Still Go To Ravenholm''' - Chapter 6: "We Don't Go To Ravenholm..."
**'''Bike Lane 17''' - Chapter 7: Highway 17
**'''Sand Trip''' - Chapter 8: Sandtraps
**'''No Prospekts''' - Chapter 9: Nova Prospekt (there was only one strip for this chapter because Frohman didn't 'have an appointment' for the combine surgery) 
**Chapter 9a: Entanglement was never a chapter in the comic, as Frohman was never allowed to venture further into Nova Prospekt and access the Combine [[List of Combine non-combat technology in Half-Life 2#Depot|depot]], as Freeman would. The author stated that he had drawn out some comics for it called "'''Befuddlement'''," and may put them up as a "lost chapter" at a later time, but at the end during a Joystiq interview, he has stated that no more comics would be created in ''Concerned'':<blockquote>"''I think I'm done. I mentioned at one point doing some "lost episodes" but I think I'm really done. Frohman was fun but I think I'll let him rest in peace.''"<ref name="NoLostEpisodes">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/02/joystiq-interview-concerneds-chris-livingston/ | title = Joystiq Interview: Concerned's Chris Livingston | work = [[Joystiq]] | accessdate = November 7 | accessyear= 2006}}</ref></blockquote>
**'''Anticitizen 101''' - Chapter 10: Anticitizen One
**'''Follow, Frohman''' - Chapter 11: "Follow Freeman!"
**'''Tower Malefactor''' - Chapter 12: "Our Benefactors".
**'''Dork Energy''' - Chapter 13: "Dark Energy"

* Unlike Gordon Freeman's [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], it is apparent that Frohman wields a [[shovel]] as a [[m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e]] weapon.

* Frohman hints of being a vegetarian. In comic #100, a Combine sniper dies of natural causes - [[cholesterol]], from which Frohman cites his reason to avoid eating meat.<ref name="Vegetarian">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-01-16 ''Concerned'' #100]. URL accessed on [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> This is not referenced elsewhere in the comic.

* In comic #139, Frohman is seen removing a pheropod from the [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)#Antlion Guards and "bugbait"|Antlion Guard]], however in ''Half-Life 2'' a Vortigaunt extracts a pheropod for Gordon Freeman, as it is "unhygienic" for humans. Therefore Frohman would not be able to do this himself as he does in the comic without probable health issues.

*In one of the comics, Frohman mistakes the borderworld sample for Bournes Pasteurised Organic Cheshire Cheese,<ref name="Cheese"/> which is a reference to a section devoted to BPOCC in the ''Concerned'' Internet forum.<ref name="BPOCC">[http://www.hlcomic.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=10 ''Concerned'' Forum Index -> Bournes Pasteurised Organic Cheshire Cheese]. URL accessed on [[September 13]], [[2006]].</ref>

* Frohman proves to be tolerant to damage up to the point of near invulnerability, taking injuries that would normally be fatal yet managing to survive and recover. Serious incidents Frohman sustains include:
** Having a pipe stuck through his mid section.<ref name="Injuries multiple 2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-09-28 ''Concerned'' #058]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>
** Taking an axe to the head.<ref name="Injuries multiple 2"/>
** Having his leg bent forwards.<ref name="Injuries multiple 2"/>
** Submerging his legs in ankle-deep toxic substances.<ref name="Injuries multiple">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-09-26 ''Concerned'' #057]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>
** Catching fire.<ref name="Injuries multiple"/>
** Getting caught in various explosions ([[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Hunter-chopper|hunter-chopper]] mines,<ref name="Injuries chopper mine">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-21 ''Concerned'' #068]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref> grenades<ref name="Vegetarian"/> and exploding barrels<ref name="Injuries exploding barrels">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-17 ''Concerned'' #066]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>).
** Receiving multiple gunshots (from Combine forces,<ref name="Injuries Combine gunshot">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-21 ''Concerned'' #164]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref> <ref name="Injuries Combine gunshot 2">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-08-29 ''Concerned'' #045]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref> resistance fighters,<ref name="Injuries Combine gunshot"/> and various others).
** Thrown onto solid objects at high speed.<ref name="Injuries high impact">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-10-28 ''Concerned'' #069]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref>
** Turning into a zombie by a headcrab but managing to retain his free will<ref name="Injuries headcrab">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2005-12-21 ''Concerned'' #091]. URL accessed on [[October 3]], [[2006]].</ref> (it is later revealed that Frohman's suggestively small brain starved the headcrab to death, allowing him to retrieve a medical kit and completely recover).<ref name="Medkits4"/>
** As a result of falling from the Citadel, breaking every bone in his body and mashing up his internal organs.<ref name="Injuries Citadel fall">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-20 ''Concerned'' #201]. URL accessed on [[October 21]], [[2006]].</ref>

It is revealed late into the comic that the result of Frohman's invulnerability is actually due to him unwittingly activating a [[cheat code]] while traveling to City 17 at the beginning.<ref name="Buddha mode activation">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-10-24 ''Concerned'' #202]. URL accessed on [[October 24]], [[2006]].</ref> By saying the word, "[[Buddha]]" out aloud, he enters a form of [[god mode]] where he could take an infinite amount of damage and would never have his health points reduced below one. He realizes this and jokingly says "Buddha" again because he finds the word funny, unwittingly deactivating the cheat code. Ironically, he dies at the end of the comic with one health point left (Due to this, it is speculated that he died due to the massive internal bleeding caused by the fall from the Citadel).

*Frohman sleeps with an [[Combine (Half-Life)|Overwatch Soldier]] plush toy.

*In [http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-08-04 #178] as Frohman walks into the employee lounge, the holographic tutor in an [[HEV suit]] from the training level can be seen walking in the opposite direction.

* ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' - An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] sees two rebels converse with several humorous lines, including a possible reference to ''Concerned'':<blockquote>"''I don't miss Dr. Breen, but I do miss his show. Remember when they had the jugglers on?''"</blockquote>However, the comic's author disputes this assertion:<blockquote>"''A lot of people writing in about this are of the opinion that this is a reference, by Valve, to my comic. Well... I don't really think so myself. It's a bit of a stretch, and while I know certain people at Valve are aware of my comic, I just can't imagine them going out of their way to reference it in the game. (Plus, I've never had jugglers in the comic.)''"<ref name="authdispute">[http://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-06-16 ''Concerned'' #162].
