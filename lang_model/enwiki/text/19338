'''Thyroid cancer''' is a [[thyroid neoplasm]] that is [[malignant tumor|malignant]]. It can be treated with [[radioactive iodine]] or surgical resection of the [[thyroid gland]]. [[Chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]] may also be used.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/thyroid-cancer/DS00492/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs</ref>

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Lymph node with papillary thyroid carcinoma.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Micrograph of a [[lymph node]] with [[papillary thyroid carcinoma]].]]
Most often the first symptom of thyroid cancer is a nodule in the thyroid region of the neck.<ref name=hu>Hu MI, Vassilopoulou-Sellin R, Lustig R, Lamont JP. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter05/article/10165/1402668 "Thyroid and Parathyroid Cancers"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> However, many adults have small nodules in their thyroids, but typically under 5% of these nodules are found to be malignant. Sometimes the first sign is an enlarged lymph node. Later symptoms that can be present are pain in the anterior region of the neck and changes in voice. 

Thyroid cancer is usually found in a [[euthyroid]] patient, but symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] or [[hypothyroidism]] may be associated with a large or metastatic well-differentiated tumor.

[[Thyroid nodules]] are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20. The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely, and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater.

==Diagnosis==
{{See|Thyroid nodule}}
After a [[thyroid nodule]] is found during a physical examination, a referral to an [[endocrinologist]], a [[thyroidologist]] or otolaryngologist may occur. Most commonly an [[ultrasound]] is performed to confirm the presence of a nodule, and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bennedbaek FN, Perrild H, Heged<U+00FC>s L |title=Diagnosis and treatment of the solitary thyroid nodule.

==Etiology==
From the 1940s to 1960s, external, low-dose radiation to the head and neck during infancy and childhood was used to treat many benign diseases. This type of therapy has been shown to predispose persons to thyroid cancer. The younger the patient was at time of exposure, the higher the risk of developing cancer.<ref name=hu/>

Another cause may be due to high-dose irradiation to the head and neck. Patients with [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] treated with mantlefield irradiation have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer, although hypothyroidism is more likely.<ref name=hu/>

==Detection of metastases==
Detection of any metastases of thyroid cancer can be performed with a full body [[scintigraphy]] using [[iodine-131]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1677/ERC-07-0120}} [http://erc.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/3/799]</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3183748}} [http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/29/11/1790.pdf]</ref>

==Treatment==
Thyroid cancer may require surgery. Common surgeries include [[thyroidectomy]], [[lobectomy]], and [[tracheostomy]].<ref name=hu/>

Radioactive [[Iodine-131]] is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy.<ref name=hu/>

External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from bone metastasis.<ref name=hu/>

[[Sorafenib]] and [[sunitinib]], approved for other indications show promise for thyroid cancer and are being used for some patients who do not qualify for clinical trials.<ref name=Sherman2009>{{cite journal |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/94/5/1493 |title=Advances in Chemotherapy of Differentiated Epithelial and Medullary Thyroid Cancers |author=Sherman |year=2009 |doi=10.1210/jc.2008-0923 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=94(5) |pages=1493<U+2013>1499 }}</ref> Numerous agents are in phase II clinical trials and [[XL184]] has started a phase III trial.<ref name=Sherman2009/>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of thyroid cancer is among the best of all cancers.  The primary reason for this is [[overdiagnosis bias]], which occurs because the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are [[overdiagnosed]] (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer).  Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers.<ref name=Welch />  Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with [[autopsy]] studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one third of older adults technically has thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm.<ref name=Welch />  It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis.  However, very few of the people with these accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has only the potential to harm them, not to help them.<ref name=Welch>{{cite book

By European statistics, the overall relative [[5-year survival rate]] for thyroid cancer is 85% for females and 74% for males.<ref name=european>Numbers from EUROCARE, from [http://books.google.se/books?id=u1aFpF-EcgwC&pg=PA10 Page 10] in: {{cite book |author=F.

Prognosis is better in younger people than older ones.<ref name=european/>

Prognosis depends mainly on the type of cancer and [[cancer stage]].
