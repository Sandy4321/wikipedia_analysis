'''Proteasomes''' are large [[protein complex]]es inside all [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]], as well as some [[bacteria]]. In eukaryotes, they are located in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name="Peters">Peters JM, Franke WW, Kleinschmidt JA. (1994) Distinct 19S and 20S subcomplexes of the 26S proteasome and their distribution in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. ''J Biol Chem'', Mar 11;269(10):7709-18. PMID 8125997</ref>  The main function of the proteasome is to degrade unneeded or damaged [[protein]]s by [[proteolysis]], a [[chemical reaction]] that breaks [[peptide bond]]s. [[Enzyme]]s that carry out such reactions are called [[protease]]s. Proteasomes are a major mechanism by which [[cell (biology)|cells]] regulate the [[concentration]] of particular proteins and degrade [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]]. The degradation process yields [[peptide]]s of about seven to eight [[amino acid]]s long, which can then be further degraded into amino acids and used in [[protein biosynthesis|synthesizing]] new proteins.<ref name="Lodish"> Lodish, H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J. (2004). ''Molecular Cell Biology'', 5th ed., ch.3, pp 66-72. New York: WH Freeman. ISBN 0716743663</ref> Proteins are tagged for degradation by a small protein called [[ubiquitin]]. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called [[ubiquitin ligase]]s. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a ''polyubiquitin chain'', which is recognized by the proteasome and allows it to bind and degrade the tagged protein.<ref name="Lodish" />

Structurally, the proteasome is a large barrel-like complex containing a "core" of four stacked rings around a central pore. Each ring is composed of seven individual proteins. The inner two rings are made of seven ''<U+03B2> subunits'' that contain the [[protease]] [[active site]]s. These sites are located on the interior surface of the rings, so that the target protein must enter the central pore before it is degraded. The outer two rings each contain seven ''<U+03B1> subunits'' whose function is to maintain a "gate" through which proteins enter the barrel. These <U+03B1> subunits are controlled by binding to "cap" structures or ''regulatory particles'' that recognize polyubiquitin tags attached to protein substrates and initiate the degradation process. The overall system of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is known as the ''ubiquitin-proteasome system''.

The proteasomal degradation pathway is essential for many cellular processes, including the [[cell cycle]], the regulation of [[gene expression]], and responses to [[oxidative stress]]. The importance of proteolytic degradation inside cells and the role of [[ubiquitin]] in proteolytic pathways was acknowledged in the award of the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] to [[Aaron Ciechanover]], [[Avram Hershko]] and [[Irwin Rose]].<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2004/ |title=Nobel Prize Awardees in Chemistry, 2004 |accessdate=2006-12-11 |author=Nobel Prize Committee |date=2004 }}</ref>

==Discovery==
Before the discovery of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on [[lysosome]]s, membrane-bound [[organelle]]s with [[acid]]ic and [[protease]]-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles.<ref name="Lodish" /> However, work on ATP-dependent protein degradation in [[reticulocyte]]s, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time.<!--not a typo: it was published under this spelling--><ref name="Ciehanover">Ciehanover A, Hod Y, Hershko A. (1978). A heat-stable polypeptide component of an ATP-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocytes. ''Biochem Biophys Res Commun.'' 81(4):1100-1105. PMID 666810</ref> Later work on modification of [[histone]]s led to the identification of an unexpected [[covalent]] modification of the histone protein by a branched bond between a histone [[lysine]] residue and the [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] [[glycine]] residue of the protein [[ubiquitin]], which had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously-identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin.<ref name="Ciechanover">Ciechanover A. (2000). Early work on the ubiquitin proteasome system, an interview with Aaron Ciechanover. ''Cell Death Differ'' Sep;12(9):1167-77. PMID 16094393</ref>

Much of the early work leading up to the discovery of the ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the [[Technion]] in the laboratory of [[Avram Hershko]], where [[Aaron Ciechanover]] worked as a graduate student. Hershko's year-long sabbatical in the laboratory of [[Irwin Rose]] at the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]] provided key conceptual insights, though Rose later downplayed his role in the discovery.<ref name="Hershko">Hershko A. (2005). Early work on the ubiquitin proteasome system, an interview with Avram Hershko. ''Cell Death Differ'' 12, 1158<U+2013>1161. PMID 16094391</ref> The three shared the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their work in discovering this system.<ref name="Nobel" />

Although [[electron microscopy]] data revealing the stacked-ring structure of the proteasome became available in the mid-1980's,<ref name="Kopp">Kopp F, Steiner R, Dahlmann B, Kuehn L, Reinauer H. (1986). Size and shape of the multicatalytic proteinase from rat skeletal muscle. ''Biochim Biophys Acta'' 872(3):253-60. PMID 3524688</ref> the first structure of the proteasome core particle was not solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] until 1994.<ref name="Lowe">L<U+00F6>we J, Stock D, Jap B, Zwickl P, Baumeister W, Huber R. (1995). Crystal structure of the 20S proteasome from the archaeon ''T. acidophilum'' at 3.4 <U+00C5> resolution. ''Science'' 268, 533-539. PMID 7725097</ref> As of 2006, no structure has been solved of the core particle in complex with the most common form of regulatory cap.

==Structure and organization==
{{ImageStackRight|220|[[Image:1G0U_subunits_sideview.png|thumb|200px|A schematic diagram of the proteasome 20S core particle viewed from one side. The <U+03B1> subunits that make up the outer two rings are shown in green, and the <U+03B2> subunits that make up the inner two rings are shown in blue.]][[Image:1G0U_subunits_topview.png|thumb|200px|Top view of the same schematic, illustrating the seven-fold symmetry of the rings.]]}}
The proteasome subcomponents are often referred to by their [[Svedberg]] sedimentation coefficient (denoted ''S''). The most common form of the proteasome is known as the 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 [[atomic mass unit|kilodaltons]] (kDa) in [[molecular mass]] and contains one 20S core particle structure and two 19S regulatory caps. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple [[ATPase]] [[active site]]s and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially the same manner as the 19S particle; the 11S may play a role in degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a [[virus]].<ref name="Wang">Wang J, Maldonado MA. (2006). The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System and Its Role in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases. ''Cell Mol Immunol'' 3(4): 255. PMID 16978533 </ref>

===20S core particle===
The number and diversity of subunits contained in the 20S core particle depends on the organism; the number of distinct and specialized subunits is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. All 20S particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of two different types of subunits; <U+03B1> subunits are structural in nature, while <U+03B2> subunits are predominantly [[catalysis|catalytic]]. The outer two rings in the stack consist of seven <U+03B1> subunits each, which serve as docking domains for the regulatory particles and form an exterior gate blocking unregulated access to the interior cavity. The inner two rings each consist of seven <U+03B2> subunits and contain the [[protease]] [[active site]]s that perform the proteolysis reactions. The size of the proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 [[angstrom]]s (<U+00C5>) by 115 <U+00C5>. The interior chamber is at most 53 <U+00C5> wide, though the entrance can be as narrow as 13 <U+00C5>, suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter.<ref name="Nandi">Nandi D, Tahiliani P, Kumar A, Chandu D. (2006). The ubiquitin-proteasome system. ''J Biosci'' Mar;31(1):137-55. PMID 16595883</ref> 

In [[archaea]] such as ''[[Thermoplasma|Thermoplasma acidophilum]]'', all the <U+03B1> and all the <U+03B2> subunits are identical, while eukaryotic proteasomes such as those in [[yeast]] contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In [[mammal]]s, the <U+03B2>1, <U+03B2>2, and <U+03B2>5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered [[chymotrypsin]]-like, [[trypsin]]-like, and [[peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing]] (PHGH).<ref name="Heinemeyer">Heinemeyer W, Fischer M, Krimmer T, Stachon U, Wolf DH. (1997). The Active Sites of the Eukaryotic 20S Proteasome and Their Involvement in Subunit Precursor Processing ''J Biol Chem'' 272(40):25200-25209. PMID 9312134 </ref> Alternative <U+03B2> forms denoted <U+03B2>1i, <U+03B2>2i, and <U+03B2>5i can be expressed in [[hematopoietic]] cells in response to exposure to pro-[[inflammatory]] [[cell signaling|signal]]s such as [[cytokine]]s, in particular, [[interferon gamma]]. The proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the ''immunoproteasome'', whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal proteasome.<ref name="Nandi" />

===19S regulatory particle===
The 19S particle in eukaryotes consists of 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 10-protein base that binds directly to the <U+03B1> ring of the 20S core particle, and a 9-protein lid where polyubiquitin is bound. Six of the ten base proteins have [[ATPase]] activity. The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATP-binding sites.<ref name="Liu">Liu CW, Li X, Thompson D, Wooding K, Chang TL, Tang Z, Yu H, Thomas PJ, DeMartino GN. (2006). ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis play distinct roles in the function of 26S proteasome. ''Mol Cell'' Oct 6;24(1):39-50. PMID 17018291</ref> ATP hydrolysis is required for the assembled complex to degrade a folded and ubiquitinated protein, although it is not yet clear whether that energy is used mainly for substrate unfolding,<ref name="Lam">Lam YA, Lawson TG, Velayutham M, Zweier JL, Pickart CM. (2002). A proteasomal ATPase subunit recognizes the polyubiquitin degradation signal. ''Nature'' 416(6882):763-7. PMID 11961560</ref> opening of the core channel,<ref name="Sharon">Sharon M, Taverner T, Ambroggio XI, Deshaies RJ, Robinson CV. (2006). Structural Organization of the 19S Proteasome Lid: Insights from MS of Intact Complexes. ''PLoS Biol'' Aug;4(8):e267. PMID 16869714</ref> or some combination of processes.<ref name="Liu"/> As of 2006, the structure of the 26S proteasome has not been solved, although the 19S and 11S particles are believed to bind in a similar way to the <U+03B1> rings of the 20S core particle.<ref name="Sharon" />

Individual components of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. [[Gankyrin]], a recently identified [[oncogene|oncoprotein]], is one of the 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] CDK4 and plays a key role in recognizing ubiquitinated [[p53]], via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase [[MDM2]]. Gankyrin is anti-[[apoptosis|apoptotic]] and has been shown to be overexpressed in some [[tumor]] cell types such as [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref name="Higashitsuji">Higashitsuji H, Liu Y, Mayer RJ, Fujita J. (2005). The oncoprotein gankyrin negatively regulates both p53 and RB by enhancing proteasomal degradation. ''Cell Cycle'' 4(10):1335-7. PMID 16177571 </ref>

===11S regulatory particle===
20S proteasomes can also associate with a second type of regulatory particle, a heptameric structure that does not contain any [[ATPase]]s and can promote the degradation of short [[peptide]]s, but not of complete proteins. Presumably this is because the complex cannot unfold larger substrates. This structure is also known as PA28 or REG. The mechanisms by which it binds to the core particle through the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] tails of its subunits and induces <U+03B1>-ring [[conformational change]]s to open the 20S gate suggest a similar mechanism for the 19S particle.<ref name="Forster">Forster A, Masters EI, Whitby FG, Robinson H, Hill CP. (2005). The 1.9 <U+00C5> Structure of a Proteasome-11S Activator Complex and Implications for Proteasome-PAN/PA700 Interactions. ''Mol Cell'' May 27;18(5):589-99. PMID 15916965</ref> The expression of the 11S particle is induced by [[interferon gamma]] and is responsible, in conjunction with the immunoproteasome <U+03B2> subunits, for the generation of peptides that bind to the [[major histocompatibility complex]].<ref name="Wang" />

==Assembly==
The assembly of the proteasome is a complex process due to the number of subunits that must associate to form an active complex. The <U+03B2> subunits are synthesized with [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] "propeptides" that are [[post-translational modification|post-translationally modified]] during the assembly of the 20S particle to expose the proteolytic active site. The 20S particle is assembled from two half-proteasomes, each of which consists of a seven-membered pro-<U+03B2> ring attached to a seven-membered <U+03B1> ring. The association of the <U+03B2> rings of the two half-proteasomes triggers [[threonine]]-dependent [[autolysis]] of the propeptides to expose the active site. These <U+03B2> interactions are mediated mainly by [[salt bridge]]s and [[hydrophobic]] interactions between conserved [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] whose disruption by [[mutation]] damages the proteasome's ability to assemble.<ref name="Witt">Witt S, Kwon YD, Sharon M, Felderer K, Beuttler M, Robinson CV, Baumeister W, Jap BK. (2006). Proteasome assembly triggers a switch required for active-site maturation. ''Structure'' Jul;14(7):1179-88. PMID 16843899</ref> The assembly of the half-proteasomes, in turn, is initiated by the assembly of the <U+03B1> subunits into their heptameric ring, forming a template for the association of the corresponding pro-<U+03B2> ring. The assembly of <U+03B1> subunits has not been characterized.<ref name="Kruger">Kruger E, Kloetzel PM, Enenkel C. (2001). 20S proteasome biogenesis. ''Biochimie'' Mar-Apr;83(3-4):289-93. PMID 11295488</ref> 

In general, less is known about the assembly and maturation of the 19S regulatory particles. They are believed to assemble as two distinct subcomponents, the ATPase-containing base and the ubiquitin-recognizing lid. The six ATPases in the base may assemble in a pairwise manner mediated by [[coiled-coil]] interactions.<ref name="Gorbea">Gorbea C, Taillandier D, Rechsteiner M. (1999). Assembly of the regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome. ''Mol Biol Rep'' Apr;26(1-2):15-9. PMID 10363641</ref> The order in which the nineteen subunits of the regulatory particle are bound is a likely regulatory mechanism that prevents exposure of the active site before assembly is complete.<ref name="Sharon"/>

==The protein degradation process==
[[Image:Ubiquitin cartoon.png|thumb|250px|Ribbon diagram of [[ubiquitin]], the highly conserved [[protein]] that serves as a molecular tag targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome.]]
===Ubiquitination and targeting===
Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome by [[covalent]] modification of a [[lysine]] residue that requires the coordinated reactions of three [[enzyme]]s. In the first step, a [[ubiquitin-activating enzyme]] (known as E1) hydrolyzes [[ATP]] and adenylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site [[cysteine]] residue in concert with the adenylation of a second ubiquitin.<ref name="Haas">Haas AL, Warms JV, Hershko A, Rose IA. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme: Mechanism and role in protein-ubiquitin conjugation. ''J Biol Chem.'' 1982 Mar 10;257(5):2543-8. PMID 6277905</ref> This adenylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, [[ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]] (E2). Lastly, a member of a highly-diverse class of enzymes known as [[ubiquitin ligase]]s (E3) recognize the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labelled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid.<ref name="Thrower">Thrower JS, Hoffman L, Rechsteiner M, Pickart CM. (2000). Recognition of the polyubiquitin proteolytic signal. ''EMBO J'' 19, 94<U+2013>102. PMID 10619848 </ref> It is therefore the E3 that confers [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] specificity to this system.<ref name="Risseeuw">Risseeuw EP, Daskalchuk TE, Banks TW, Liu E, Cotelesage J, Hellmann H, Estelle M, Somers DE, Crosby WL. Protein interaction analysis of SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase subunits from Arabidopsis. ''Plant J.'' 2003 Jun;34(6):753-67. PMID 12795696</ref> The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there are a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system. 

The mechanism by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an [[N-terminal end|N-terminal]] ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via [[helix bundle|three-helix bundles]]. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.<ref name="Elasser">Elsasser S, Finley D. (2005). Delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to protein-unfolding machines. ''Nat Cell Biol'' 7(8):742-9. PMID 16056265 </ref>

The ubiquitin protein itself is 76 [[amino acid]]s long and was named due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in [[eukaryote]]s are arranged in [[tandem repeat]]s, possibly due to the heavy [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-[[evolution|evolving]] protein identified to date.<ref name="Sharp">Sharp PM, Li WH. (1987). Ubiquitin genes as a paradigm of concerted evolution of tandem repeats. ''J Mol Evol'' 25(1):1432-1432. PMID 3041010 </ref>

[[Image:Ubiquitylation.png|thumb|250px|The [[ubiquitin]]ation pathway.]]

===Unfolding and translocation===
After a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is recognized by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step.<ref name="Liu" /> The substrate protein must then enter the interior of the 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] tails of the <U+03B1> ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called ''translocation'' and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination.<ref name="Liu" /> However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear.<ref name="Zhu">Zhu Q, Wani G, Wang QE, El-mahdy M, Snapka RM, Wani AA. (2005). Deubiquitination by proteasome is coordinated with substrate translocation for proteolysis in vivo. ''Exp Cell Res'' 307(2):436-51. PMID 15950624</ref> Which of these processes is the [[rate-limiting step]] in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is [[rate-limiting step|rate-limiting]], while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins.<ref name="Lam" /> The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial [[tertiary structure]], and in particular nonlocal interactions such as [[disulfide bond]]s, are sufficient to inhibit degradation.<ref name="Wenzel">Wenzel T, Baumeister W. (1995). Conformational constraints in protein degradation by the 20S proteasome. ''Nat Struct Biol'' 2: 199-204. PMID 7773788 </ref>

The gate formed by the <U+03B1> subunits prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering the interior of the 20S particle. The ATP molecules bound before the initial recognition step are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] before translocation, although there is disagreement whether the energy is needed for substrate unfolding<ref name="Lam" /> or for gate opening.<ref name="Sharon" /> The assembled 26S proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable [[adenosine triphosphate#ATP analogs|ATP analog]], but cannot degrade folded proteins, indicating that energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding.<ref name="Smith">Smith DM, Kafri G, Cheng Y, Ng D, Walz T, Goldberg AL. (2005). ATP binding to PAN or the 26S ATPases causes association with the 20S proteasome, gate opening, and translocation of unfolded proteins. ''Mol Cell'' 20(5):687-98. PMID 16337593 </ref> Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via [[facilitated diffusion]] if the 19S cap is in the ATP-bound state.<ref name="Smith2">Smith DM, Benaroudj N, Goldberg A. (2006). Proteasomes and their associated ATPases: a destructive combination. ''J Struct Biol'' 156(1):72-83. PMID 16919475 </ref> 

The mechanism for unfolding of [[globular protein]]s is necessarily general, but somewhat dependent on the [[primary structure|amino acid sequence]]. Long sequences of alternating [[glycine]] and [[alanine]] have been shown to inhibit substrate unfolding decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps.<ref name="Hoyt">Hoyt MA, Zich J, Takeuchi J, Zhang M, Govaerts C, Coffino P. (2006). Glycine-alanine repeats impair proper substrate unfolding by the proteasome. ''EMBO J'' 25(8):1720-9. PMID 16601692 </ref> Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in [[silk]] [[fibroin]]; in particular, certain [[Epstein-Barr virus]] gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing [[antigen presentation]] on the [[major histocompatibility complex]].<ref name="Zhang">Zhang M, Coffino P. (2004). Repeat sequence of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1 protein interrupts proteasome substrate processing. ''J Biol Chem'' 279(10):8635-41. PMID 14688254 </ref>

===Proteolysis===
The mechanism of proteolyisi by the <U+03B2> subunits of the 20S core particle is through a [[threonine]]-dependent [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]]. This mechanism may depend on an associated [[water]] molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine [[hydroxyl]]. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two <U+03B2> rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7<U+2013>9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized.<ref name="Voges">Voges D, Zwickl P, Baumeister W. (1999). The 26S proteasome: a molecular machine designed for controlled proteolysis. ''Annu Rev Biochem'' 68: 1015-1068. PMID 10872471 </ref> Although the three catalytic <U+03B2> subunits share a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered [[chymotrypsin]]-like, [[trypsin]]-like, and [[peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing]] (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity are the result of interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic <U+03B2> subunit also possesses a conserved [[lysine]] residue required for proteolysis.<ref name="Heinemeyer" />

Although the proteasome normally produces very short peptide fragments, in some cases these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain [[transcription factor]]s, including one component of the [[mammal]]ian complex [[NF-kB|NF-<U+03BA>B]], are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally: rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It has been suggested that long [[loop (biochemistry)|loops]] on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside.<ref name="Rape">Rape M, Jentsch S. (2002). Taking a bite: proteasomal protein processing. ''Nat Cell Biol'' 4(5):E113-6. PMID 11988749 </ref> Similar effects have been observed in [[yeast]] proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as ''regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing'' (RUP).<ref name="Rape2">Rape M, Jentsch S. (2004). Productive RUPture: activation of transcription factors by proteasomal processing. ''Biochim Biophys Acta'' 1695(1-3):209-13. PMID 15571816 </ref>

===Ubiquitin-independent degradation===
Although most proteasomal substrates must be ubiquitinated before being degraded, there are some exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-[[translation (genetics)|translational]] processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of [[NF-kB|NF-<U+03BA>B]] by processing [[p105]] into [[p50]] via internal proteolysis is one major example.<ref name="Rape" /> Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to [[intrinsically unstructured proteins|intrinsically unstructured]] regions,<ref name="Asher">Asher G, Reuven N, Shaul Y. (2006). 20S proteasomes and protein degradation "by default". ''Bioessays'' 28(8):844-9. PMID 16927316 </ref> are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner.

==Evolution==
[[Image:Hslvu_ecoli.png|thumb|200px|The assembled complex of [[hslV]] (blue) and [[hslU]] (red) from ''[[E. coli]]''. This complex of [[heat shock protein]]s is thought to resemble the ancestor of the modern proteasome.]]
The 20S proteasome is both ubiquitous and essential in [[eukaryote]]s. Some [[prokaryote]]s, including many [[archaea]] and the [[bacteria]]l order [[Actinomycetales]] also share homologs of the 20S proteasome, while most bacteria possess [[heat shock]] genes [[hslV]] and [[hslU]], whose gene products are a multimeric protease arranged in a two-layered ring and an ATPase.<ref name="Gille">Gille C, Goedel A, Schloetelburg C, Prei<U+00DF>ner R, Kloetzell PM, Gobel UB, Frommell C. (2003). A Comprehensive View on Proteasomal Sequences: Implications for the Evolution of the Proteasome. ''J Mol Biol'' 326: 1437<U+2013>1448. PMID 12595256 </ref> The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome.<ref name="Bochtler">Bochtler M, Ditzel L, Groll M, Hartmann C, Huber R. (1999). The proteasome. ''Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct.'' 28: 295<U+2013>317. PMID 10410804 </ref>  HslV is generally not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, while some [[protist]]s possess both the 20S and the hslV systems.<ref name="Gille" /> 

Sequence analysis suggests that the catalytic <U+03B2> subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly-structural <U+03B1> subunits. In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome, the <U+03B2> subunits have high [[sequence identity]] to archaeal and eukaryotic <U+03B2> subunits, while the <U+03B1> sequence identity is much lower. The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from [[lateral gene transfer]], while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple [[gene duplication]] events.<ref name="Gille" />

==Cell cycle control==
Cell cycle progression is controlled by ordered action of [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s (CDKs), activated by specific [[cyclin]]s that demarcate phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Mitotic cyclins, which persist in the cell for only a few minutes, have one of the shortest life spans of all intracellular proteins.<ref name="Lodish" /> After a CDK-cyclin complex has performed its function, the associated cyclin is polyubiquitinated and destroyed by the proteasome, which provides directionality for the cell cycle. In particular, exit from [[mitosis]] requires the proteasome-dependent dissociation of the regulatory component [[cyclin B]] from the [[mitosis promoting factor]] complex.<ref name="Chesnel">Chesnel F, Bazile F, Pascal A, Kubiak JZ. (2006). Cyclin B dissociation from CDK1 precedes its degradation upon MPF inactivation in mitotic extracts of Xenopus laevis embryos. ''Cell Cycle'' 5(15):1687-98. PMID 16921258 </ref> In [[vertebrate]] cells, "slippage" through the mitotic checkpoint leading to premature [[M phase]] exit can occur despite the delay of this exit by the [[spindle checkpoint]].<ref name="Brito">Brito DA, Rieder CL. (2006). Mitotic checkpoint slippage in humans occurs via cyclin B destruction in the presence of an active checkpoint. ''Curr Biol'' 16(12):1194-200. PMID 16782009 </ref> 

Earlier cell cycle checkpoints such a post-[[restriction point]] check between [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]] and [[S phase]] similarly involve proteasomal degradation of [[cyclin A]], whose ubiquitination is promoted by the [[anaphase promoting complex]] (APC), an E3 [[ubiquitin ligase]].<ref name="Havens">Havens CG, Ho A, Yoshioka N, Dowdy SF. (2006). Regulation of late G1/S phase transition and APC Cdh1 by reactive oxygen species. ''Mol Cell Biol'' 26(12):4701-11. PMID 16738333 </ref> The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex ([[SCF complex]]) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the Skp1 component, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.<ref name="Bashir">Bashir T, Dorrello NV, Amador V, Guardavaccaro D, Pagano M. (2004). Control of the SCF(Skp2-Cks1) ubiquitin ligase by the APC/C(Cdh1) ubiquitin ligase. ''Nature'' 428(6979):190-3. PMID 15014502 </ref>

===Regulation of plant growth===
In [[plant]]s, signaling by [[auxin]]s, or [[phytohormone]]s that order the direction and [[tropism]] of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of [[transcription factor]] repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression.<ref name="Dharmasiri">Dharmasiri S, Estelle M. (2002). The role of regulated protein degradation in auxin response. ''Plant Mol Biol'' 49(3-4):401-9. PMID 12036263 </ref> The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression is thought to be mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.<ref name="Weijers">Weijers D, Benkova E, Jager KE, Schlereth A, Hamann T, Kientz M, Wilmoth JC, Reed JW, Jurgens G. (2005). Developmental specificity of auxin response by pairs of ARF and Aux/IAA transcriptional regulators. ''EMBO J'' 24(10):1874-85. PMID 15889151 </ref>

===Apoptosis===
Both internal and external [[cell signaling|signals]] can lead to the induction of [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as [[caspase]]s, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis,<ref name="Schwartz">Schwartz LM, Myer A, Kosz L, Engelstein M and Maier C. (1990) Activation of polyubiquitin gene expression during developmentally programmed cell death. ''Neuron'' 5: 411-419. PMID 2169771 </ref><ref name="Low">Low P, Bussell K, Dawson SP, Billett MA, Mayer RJ and Reynolds SE (1997) Expression of a 26S proteasome ATPase subunit, MS73, in muscles that undergo developmentally programmed cell death, and its control by ecdysteroid hormones in the insect ''Manduca sexta''.

Proteasome inhibition has different effects on apoptosis induction in different cell types. The proteasome is not generally required for apoptosis, although inhibiting it is pro-apoptotic in most cell types that have been studied. However, some cell lines<U+2014>in particular, [[primary culture]]s of [[quiescence|quiescent]] and [[cell differentiation|differentiated]] cells such as [[thymocyte]]s and [[neuron]]s<U+2014>are prevented from undergoing apoptosis on exposure to proteasome inhibitors. The mechanism for this effect is not clear, but is hypothesized to be specific to cells in quiescent states, or to result from the differential activity of the pro-apoptotic [[kinase]] [[JNK]].<ref name="Orlowski">Orlowski RZ. (1999). The role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in apoptosis. ''Cell Death Differ'' 6: 303-313. PMID 10381632 </ref> The ability of proteasome inhibitors to induce apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells has been exploited in several recently developed [[chemotherapy]] agents.

==Response to cellular stress==
In response to cellular stresses - such as [[infection]], [[heat shock]], or [[reactive oxygen species|oxidative damage]] - [[heat shock protein]]s are expressed that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation. Both [[Hsp27]] and [[Hsp90]]<U+2014>[[chaperone]] proteins have been implicated in increasing the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process.<ref name="Garrido">Garrido C, Brunet M, Didelot C, Zermati Y, Schmitt E, Kroemer G. (2006). Heat Shock Proteins 27 and 70: Anti-Apoptotic Proteins with Tumorigenic Properties. ''Cell Cycle'' 5(22). PMID 17106261 </ref> [[Hsp70]], on the other hand, binds exposed [[hydrophobic]] patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation.<ref name="Park">Park SH, Bolender N, Eisele F, Kostova Z, Takeuchi J, Coffino P, Wolf DH. (2006). The Cytoplasmic Hsp70 Chaperone Machinery Subjects Misfolded and ER Import Incompetent Proteins to Degradation via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System. ''Mol Biol Cell'' Epub. PMID 17065559 </ref> The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.<ref name="Dai">Dai Q, Qian SB, Li HH, McDonough H, Borchers C, Huang D, Takayama S, Younger JM, Ren HY, Cyr DM, Patterson C. (2005). Regulation of the cytoplasmic quality control protein degradation pathway by BAG2. ''J Biol Chem'' 280(46):38673-81. PMID 16169850 </ref>

Similar mechanisms exist to promote the degradation of [[redox|oxidatively-damaged]] proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by [[PARP]] and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized [[histone]]s.<ref name="Bader">Bader N, Grune T. (2006). Protein oxidation and proteolysis. ''Biol Chem'' 387(10-11):1351-5. PMID 17081106 </ref> Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin.<ref name="Shringarpure" /> However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with [[aging]].<ref name="Davies">Davies KJ. (2003). Degradation of oxidized proteins by the 20S proteasome. ''Biochimie'' 83(3-4):301-10. PMID 11295490 </ref>

Impaired proteasomal activity has been suggested as an explanation for some of the late-onset [[neurodegenerative]] diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. In these diseases large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in [[neurotoxicity]], through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested as a cause of aggregation and [[Lewy body]] formation in Parkinson's.<ref name="McNaught">McNaught KS, Jackson T, JnoBaptiste R, Kapustin A, Olanow CW. (2006). Proteasomal dysfunction in sporadic Parkinson's disease. ''Neurology'' 66(10 Suppl 4):S37-49. PMID 16717251 </ref> This hypothesis is supported by the observation that [[yeast]] models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from [[alpha-synuclein]], the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity.<ref name="Sharma">Sharma N, Brandis KA, Herrera SK, Johnson BE, Vaidya T, Shrestha R, Debburman SK. (2006). Alpha-Synuclein budding yeast model: toxicity enhanced by impaired proteasome and oxidative stress. ''J Mol Neurosci'' 28(2):161-78. PMID 16679556 </ref>

==Role in the immune system==
The proteasome plays a straightforward but critical role in the function of the [[adaptive immunity|adaptive immune system]]. Peptide [[antigen]]s are displayed by the [[major histocompatibility complex]] class I (MHC) proteins on the surface of [[antigen-presenting cell]]s. These peptides are products of proteasomal degradation of proteins originated by the invading [[pathogen]]. Although constitutively-expressed proteasomes can participate in this process, a specialized complex composed of proteins whose [[gene expression|expression]] is induced by [[interferon gamma]] produces peptides of the optimal size and composition for MHC binding. These proteins whose expression increases during the immune response include the 11S regulatory particle, whose main known biological role is regulating the production of MHC ligands, and specialized <U+03B2> subunits called <U+03B2>1i, <U+03B2>2i, and <U+03B2>5i with altered substrate specificity. The complex formed with the specialized <U+03B2> subunits is known as the ''immunoproteasome''.<ref name="Wang" /> 

The strength of MHC class I ligand binding is dependent on the composition of the ligand [[C-terminal end|C-terminus]], as peptides bind by [[hydrogen bond]]ing and by close contacts with a region called the "B pocket" on the MHC surface. Optimal residues for the C-terminal end of these peptides are [[leucine]] and [[valine]].<ref name="Sliz">Sliz P, Michielin O, Cerottini JC, Luescher I, Romero P, Karplus M, Wiley DC. (2001). Crystal structures of two closely related but antigenically distinct HLA-A2/melanocyte-melanoma tumor-antigen peptide complexes. J Immunol. 167:3276<U+2013>3284. PMID 11544315 </ref><ref name="Davies">Davies MN, Hattotuwagama CK, Moss DS, Drew MG, Flower DR. (2006). Statistical deconvolution of enthalpic energetic contributions to MHC-peptide binding affinity. '''BMC Struct Biol'' 6:5. PMID 16549002 </ref> The [[N-terminal end|N-terminal]] residues, particularly the second residue in the peptide, also play a key role in determining binding affinity.<ref name="Davies" /> The immunoproteasome complex generates the correct C-terminal tails; later processing of the products by [[interferon gamma]]-induced [[aminopeptidase]]s trims the N-termini for optimal MHC ligand production.<ref name="Wang" />

Due to its role in generating the activated form of [[NF-kB|NF-<U+03BA>B]], an anti-[[apoptosis|apoptotic]] and pro-[[inflammatory]] regulator of [[cytokine]] expression, proteasomal activity has been linked to inflammatory and [[autoimmune disease]]s. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name="Wang" />

==Proteasome inhibitors==

Proteasome inhibitors have effective anti-[[tumor]] activity in [[cell culture]], inducing [[apoptosis]] by disrupting the regulated degradation of pro-growth cell cycle proteins.<ref name="Adams">Adams J, Palombella VJ, Sausville EA, Johnson J, Destree A, Lazarus DD, Maas J, Pien CS, Prakash S, Elliott PJ.

The molecule [[ritonavir]], marketed as Norvir, was developed as a [[protease inhibitor]] and used to target [[HIV]] infection. However, it has been shown to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases; specifically, the [[chymotrypsin]]-like activity of the proteasome is inhibited by ritonavir, while the [[trypsin]]-like activity is somewhat enhanced.<ref name="Schmidtke">Schmidtke G, Holzhutter HG, Bogyo M, Kairies N, Groll M, de Giuli R, Emch S, Groettrup M.

(2004). Effects of the proteasome inhibitor ritonavir on glioma growth in vitro and in vivo. ''Mol Cancer Ther'' 3(2):129-36. PMID 14985453 </ref>

Proteasome inhibitors have also shown promise in treating autoimmune diseases in animal models. For example, studies in mice bearing human [[skin graft]]s found a reduction in the size of lesions from [[psoriasis]] after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor.<ref name="Zollner">Zollner TM, Podda M, Pien C, Elliott PJ, Kaufmann R, Boehncke WH.

Labeling and inhibition of the proteasome is also of interest in laboratory settings for both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' study of proteasomal activity in cells. The most commonly used laboratory inhibitor is [[lactacystin]], a natural product synthesized by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' [[bacteria]].<ref name="Orlowski" /> [[Fluorescent]] inhibitors have also been developed to specifically label the active sites of the assembled proteasome.<ref name="Verdoes">Verdoes M, Florea BI, Menendez-Benito V, Maynard CJ, Witte MD, van der Linden WA, van den Nieuwendijk AM, Hofmann T, Berkers CR, van Leeuwen FW, Groothuis TA, Leeuwenburgh MA, Ovaa H, Neefjes JJ, Filippov DV, van der Marel GA, Dantuma NP, Overkleeft HS.
