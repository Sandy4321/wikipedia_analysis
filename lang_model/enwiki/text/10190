[[File:Helmand in Afghanistan.svg|right|thumb|Map of [[Afghanistan]] with [[Helmand Province|Helmand]] highlighted.]]
The '''2011 Helmand Province incident''' was the killing, on 15 September 2011,<ref name="BAILII"/> of an injured [[Taliban]] insurgent by [[Royal Marines]].<ref name="BBC guilty"/> Three Royal Marines, known during their trial as Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by [[court-martial]]. On 8 November 2013,<ref name="BAILII"/><ref name="BBC guilty"/><ref name="BBC named"/> Marines B and C were acquitted,<ref name="BAILII"/><ref name="Independent jailed"/> but Marine A was found guilty of the murder of the Afghan combatant,<ref name="BAILII"/> in contravention of section 42 of the [[Armed Forces Act 2006]].<ref name="BBC named"/> Later, on 5 December,<ref name="BBC named"/> [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|Lord Thomas]] and two other [[High Court in London|High Court]] judges lifted the existing [[anonymity order]] on Marine A, allowing him to be named as [[Sergeant#Royal_Marines_and_Army|Sergeant]] Alexander Wayne Blackman.<ref name="Guardian named"/> On 6 December, Blackman was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a minimum term of 10 years,<ref name="Telegraph sentenced"/> and [[Dishonourable discharge|dismissed with disgrace]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref name="R v Blackman"/> On 22 May 2014, the [[EWCA|Court of Appeal]] reduced his minimum term to 8 years.<ref name="BAILII 2014"/>

On 19 December 2013, the anonymity order on Marines B and C was also lifted by the Court, and they were named as [[Corporal#United_Kingdom|Corporal]] Christopher Glyn Watson and Marine Jack Alexander Hammond.<ref name="Guardian BC"/>

== The event ==
The incident took place in [[Helmand Province]] during [[Operation Herrick]] 14,<ref name="Guardian named"/> part of the [[British Armed Forces|British]] effort in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]]. Blackman, of [[42 Commando]], [[Royal Marines]],<ref name="R v ABCDE"/> was part of a Marine patrol that came across an Afghan fighter in a field wounded by [[Apache Helicopter]] gunfire.<ref name="BAILII"/><ref name="R v Blackman"/><ref name="Telegraph sentenced long"/> Blackman ordered the Afghan to be moved out of sight of the British [[Persistent Ground Surveillance System]],<ref name="BAILII"/> a camera on a balloon above British [[Forward Operating Base]] [[List_of_ISAF_installations_in_Afghanistan#Helmand_Province|Shazad]] covering the area Blackman's patrol had been sent to.<ref name="BAILII 2014"/> Video evidence played at the Marines' subsequent trial shows them dragging the man across the field and then kicking him.<ref name="Mirror audio"/> Blackman ordered other servicemen to stop administering [[first aid]] to the insurgent<ref name="BAILII"/> and eventually shot the man in the chest with a 9&nbsp;mm [[pistol]],<ref name="R v Blackman"/><ref name="Mirror audio"/> saying: "[[:wikt:shuffle off this mortal coil|Shuffle off this mortal coil]], you [[:wikt:cunt#Noun|cunt]]. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us."<ref name="Telegraph sentenced long"/><ref name="Mirror audio"/><ref name="Mirror jailed"/><ref name="Guardian BC"/> He then added: "I just broke the [[Geneva Convention]]."<ref name="BBC named"/><ref name="BBC One"/>

== Criminal trial and sentencing ==
[[File:London Royal Courts of Justice 501523 h000008.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Royal Courts of Justice|Law Courts]] building, housing the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]].]]
After the 15 September incident, Blackman continued with his tour of duty, leaving [[Helmand Province]] in late October 2011.<ref name="Guardian named"/> On 13 October 2012, at the decision of the [[Service Prosecution Authority]], Marines A<U+2013>E were [[Criminal charge|charge]]d with the murder of the unnamed Afghan insurgent.<ref name="BAILII"/> The lead came after British [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|civilian police]] discovered suspicious video footage on a serviceman's laptop.<ref name="BBC guilty"/> Marines D and E had charges against them dropped on 5 February 2013.<ref name="BAILII"/> Marines A, B and C first appeared in court in August 2013, where they entered a not-guilty [[plea]].<ref name="BBC guilty"/> The military trial of Marines A, B and C, protected from view in court behind a screen because of an anonymity order,<ref name="BBC guilty"/> began on 23 October 2013<ref name="BAILII"/> and lasted two weeks.<ref name="BBC guilty"/> Their court-martial board (equivalent to a jury in the civilian justice system)<ref name="BAILII"/> was seven strong,<ref name="BBC named"/><ref name="Mirror jailed"/> something usually only done for the more serious cases.<ref name="Guardian minimum term"/>

The [[verdict]] (8 November 2013)<ref name="BAILII"/> and [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] (6 December 2013) were both delivered at the Military Court Centre in [[Bulford]], Wiltshire.<ref name="BBC guilty"/><ref name="BBC named"/><ref name="Telegraph sentenced"/> The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading up the panel at a court-martial)<ref name="Guardian minimum term"/> was [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate General]] [[Jeff Blackett]].<ref name="Telegraph sentenced long"/> The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence,<ref name="BBC guilty"/><ref name="R v Blackman"/> so it was only in the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to decide on the minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty.<ref name="Guardian minimum term"/> He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison.<ref name="Telegraph sentenced"/> On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|Lord Thomas]], upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.<ref name="BAILII 2014"/>

== Anonymity orders ==
Running in parallel to the Marines' criminal trial were legal proceedings relating to the anonymity of the defendants. In the autumn of 2012, Judges Advocate Elsom and Blackett issued [[anonymity order]]s for the Marine defendants due to the risk that, once named, the defendants would become targets for terrorists.<ref name="BAILII"/><ref name="Guardian named"/> The move had been opposed by elements of the UK media.<ref name="BAILII"/> A lawyer for the [[Press Association]] argued that anonymity orders should not be issued in this case because, firstly, British [[Military awards and decorations of the United Kingdom|military award]] recipients named in the media had not been previously targeted; and, secondly, that the names of those British service personnel investigated following the [[death of Baha Mousa]] had not been similarly protected.<ref name="Judiciary 2012"/> The 2012 anonymity orders were upheld at the beginning of the trial in October 2013.<ref name="BAILII"/> The order was lifted for Blackman (hitherto Marine A)<ref name="R v ABCDE"/> on 5 December 2013 by the [[High Court in London|High Court]].<ref name="BBC named"/> The most senior figure involved in that verdict was [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|Lord Thomas]].<ref name="BBC named"/><ref name="Independent jailed"/> The same ruling had it that the identities of Marines B and C also be revealed unless they submit an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name="Guardian BC"/> No such appeal was lodged within the set deadline, and so, on 19 December 2013, Marine B was named as Corporal Christopher Glyn Watson and Marine C was named as Marine Jack Alexander Hammond.<ref name="R v ABCDE 19 Dec"/><ref name="Guardian BC"/> The anonymity of Marines D and E was upheld on 19 December "pending any further order by the [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate General]]".<ref name="R v ABCDE 19 Dec"/>

Jeff Blackett also restricted public access to the evidence used at the trial, releasing on 8 November stills, audio clips and transcripts from the serviceman's video that was played to the court-martial board,<ref name="Mirror audio"/> but ruling that the full video itself not be released,<ref name="DVD"/><ref name="Guardian named"/><ref name="Mirror audio"/> since doing so "would increase the threat of harm to British service personnel."<ref name="DVD"/><ref name="Mirror audio"/> On 5 December 2013, the Court Martial Appeal Court upheld the earlier decisions prohibiting the release of the video footage of the attack and some of the stills from it.<ref name="BAILII"/> The Court stated, however, that the prohibition was to prevent the material being used for [[radicalisation]], rather than it posing a risk to the life of the defendants.<ref name="BAILII"/>

== Reactions ==
The legal proceedings relating to the Marines garnered widespread British public and media attention.

Reacting to Marine A's guilty verdict, Royal Marines [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Bill Dunham]] called the murder "a ... shocking and appalling aberration" that was "not consistent with the ethos, values and standards of the Royal Marines", but was nevertheless an "isolated incident".<ref name="BBC guilty"/> [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Mike Jackson]] said he was "saddened" by the case.<ref name="BBC guilty"/>

Marine A's guilty verdict led to a showing of public support for the Marine, with people creating [[social media]] groups and online petitions alternately asking that he be given a lenient sentence and calling for his release.<ref name="Telegraph wife"/><ref name="Mail sentence"/> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' supported this movement.<ref name="Telegraph petition"/>

When he was sentenced to 10 years, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Nick Houghton]] called Blackman's actions a "heinous crime" and commented that "murder is murder".<ref name="Telegraph wife"/> By contrast, Blackman's commanding officer, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Simon Chapman, [[42 Commando]], said in a letter read to the court that Blackman had had a "momentary ... lapse of judgment" and was "not a bad man", and added that Blackman had his "full support".<ref name="Mail sentence"/> Blackman himself said in a statement that he was "devastated" and "very sorry for any damage caused to the Royal Marines".<ref name="Mail sentence"/>
