'''Cueva de Montesinos''' is a cave of the [[Province of Albacete]], [[Spain]]. At the bottom of the cave is a small lake formed by rainwater filtering through the cave. It has been discovered through a series of experiments and tests that the water in that lagoon is connected by underground streams with the natural park of Ruidera.
